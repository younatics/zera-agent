"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court swore in Gambian lawyer Fatou Bensouda as its chief prosecutor Friday, the first woman to assume the top job at the world war crimes tribunal. She replaces Argentinian Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the inaugural prosecutor for the world court, whose nine-year term ends this month. Bensouda served as Moreno-Ocampo's deputy at the court based in The Hague, Netherlands. Member nations that recognize the court's jurisdiction voted for her unanimously during a December meeting at the United Nations. Her appointment comes amid fierce criticism against the court -- which has a heavy caseload of Africa investigations -- that it disburses justice selectively by focusing on the continent. The court currently has investigations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Uganda, Kenya, Sudan, Ivory Coast and Libya. ""Bensouda is taking over an established office with an already sizable caseload,"" Human Rights Watch said in a statement. ""The office has opened investigations in seven countries and is conducting preliminary examinations to determine whether to open an investigation in at least seven other countries."" FIFA asks war crimes prosecutor to investigate corruption . Critics have said the court targets Africa and bypasses opportunities to investigate abuses in various nations, including Afghanistan and Iraq. ""Her election is a positive move by the International Criminal Court, "" said Ayo Johnson, director of Viewpoint Africa. ""The court needs an African in the role to justify why it is so heavily focused on African dictators . The court must be fair and should be seen as consistent in how it discharges justice, and not only focus on Africa. Prosecutor seeks new Congo war crimes warrants . Bensouda has worked in various other positions, including as adviser to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which is trying key figures in the 1994 genocide. She has also served as justice minister and attorney general in her native Gambia. Supporters of the court applauded her appointment and said the court provides justice to victims of nations where the legal system is not efficient. ""In Syria and other strife-torn countries over the past 10 years, the ICC has come to symbolize the last, best hope for justice,"" said Richard Dicker, international justice director at Human Rights Watch. ""We look to Bensouda's leadership to advance cases, build bridges with victims, and push countries to support its impartial application of the law to get the job done."" Bensouda, who will serve for nine years, was on this year's Time magazine list of 100 Most Influential People in the World.

"(CNN) -- As a father, my heart breaks. The starting five of the University of Kentucky basketball team â€” the 2012 NCAA champions â€” announced earlier this month that they're leaving college to go pro. It happens every year in the wake of March Madness, but as an African-American father, I feel my heart crack a little. Yes these young champions will make money, lots of it, and will have access to instant fame. I understand why they made the choice, but their collective decision says something about the options in front of all young African-American men. The Great Migration that saw my elders move from the farm to the factory has shifted; these days, too many men of promise move from college to pro sports. I've been researching the lives of black men for much of my entire career, as a social worker for 15 years in Chicago and since 1998 as a college professor and scholar in Milwaukee. I've interviewed them, written about them and filmed them, capturing their lives and hopes; I've spent most of my time with men who had little to no incomes and limited academic and employment skills. They are often frustrated, homeless, unemployed and debt-ridden. So I know what could be ahead for young men who put all their hopes into basketball. According to William Julius Wilson, author of ""More than Just Race,"" for the past four decades, low-skilled African-American men have experienced more difficulty getting jobs than any other racial groups. In Milwaukee, Marc Levine of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Center for Economic Development published a report in 2012 that reports when it comes to black men in their prime working years (25-54) only 44.7 % were employed. The recession has hurt people of all races, but black men have been hit the hardest when it comes to jobs. The starting five at Kentucky might think they're a world away from these statistics, but how long will they actually have a career? According to the Collegiate Basketball News Company website, only 51 players, or 11.9% of the players on the 2011-12 NBA opening day roster have more than 10 years of NBA experience. The average length of playing time is approximately five years and the median salary is $2.33 million. That's a big salary for one year, but not if it has to last you far beyond your playing years. When my son was a child, like many boys he dreamed of being a basketball player where he grew up. My wife and I didn't tell him otherwise; we told him he'd need to have options. But not every child hears that and not every child has that chance. Too many young black men are encouraged to perfect their ""balling'' skills but not their academic skills. I know, because I was there. As a college athlete at the University of Detroit in the late 1970s, I was a runner. But I also worked as the statistician for the basketball team, the Titans, led by the legendary Dick Vitale. The players were my peers and my friends. And some of them did quite well, playing for the Pistons in Detroit, the 76ers in Philadelphia and the Celtics in Boston. But not everyone left a winning Titan. Some of my friends didn't make it to the big leagues and because of their emphasis on basketball, they didn't graduate with a degree, either, unlike those of us in the other sports. Some of them ended up with drug habits or homeless. Others became fathers to children they couldn't support. So, my heart breaks when I think of these young men from Kentucky. But it's not breaking at the choice they made. The sad truth is, I understand it. If you look out on a landscape where so many black men are unemployed, rolling the dice on the pros can feel like a rational choice -- the only choice, maybe, when there are so few options, despite the terrible odds. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Pate.","The starting five of the champion Kentucky basketball team are going pro .

"(CNN) -- This week on The Big Three we say bye bye to Michele Bachmann; comedian Russell Brand joins us (naked, apparently) to talk about his column condemning group-blame in the wake of the brutal beheading of a British soldier; and Dean and Margaret offer their take on a commencement address for the Class of 2013. First, one of the most polarizing figures in American politics decided not to run for re-election this week. I think I heard church bells ringing in reaction. Congresswoman Michele Bachmann was briefly an icon of the tea party movement and even pursued an ill-advised presidential campaign that resulted in numerous -- and ongoing -- ethics investigations. Bachmann used her 15 minutes of fame to divide and demagogue our national debates, routinely accusing opponents of being anti-American and parroting conspiracy theories from her congressional pulpit. Her frequently fact-free accusations made her a favorite on the far-right, but interestingly it is liberal Democrats like Dean who already think they're going to miss her the most, while Margaret sees her departure as a win for reforming the Republican Party. Russell Brand is best known as a British comedian and TV/film star, who, in addition to co-starring in the upcoming animated film ""Despicable Me 2,"" is also a Solzhenitzyn-quoting, part-time essayist. In the wake of the barbaric beheading of a soldier in London, Brand wrote an essay in The Sun called ""Blame this on madness...not Muslims."" Click here to hear podcast . Dean was particularly touched by the effort to defend the Muslim community from the ugly passions stirred by group blame. Brand's perspective is that mental illness is more at fault in the attack than the influence of radical Islam and that root causes must be analyzed, as well. While I agree with Brand's assertion that we can't let extremists determine the terms of debate for the rest of society, especially when their goal is to take us off center by inspiring further hate and distrust, I'm not convinced that taking troops out of Afghanistan would stop terrorism -- and, unlike Brand, I think that evil exists. But it's a lively, thoughtful conversation -- especially considering that Brand informed us afterward that he conducted it naked looking in a mirror. Which is a sideways segue to commemorating the end of another college year. Yes, its commencement address season and already words of wisdom are being dispensed on college campuses across the country by the likes of Stephen Colbert, President Obama and Wolf Blitzer. The millennial generation is coming of age and we debate whether the ""everybody gets a trophy"" ethos (plus the uphill economic climb) has left them well prepared for life after college. Dean orates a commencement address of his own, while Margaret and I dispense our advice (you have to be willing to work hard if you want to follow your bliss). Plus, I trot out a dimly remembered quote I like: ""The only place where success comes before work is the dictionary.""

"(CNN) -- I remember the exact moment when I first thought I could move back to Ohio from California. It hit me on a hot August morning on a visit to my sister in Columbus, as I walked to a local coffee shop. ""You could live here."" The thought was so foreign it caused a physical response. I stopped and shook my head, as though an errant bird had plowed into me. ""No, I could not,"" I said firmly to whatever voice had popped into my psyche. I could not possibly choose to live in a city that's nickname was -- somewhat unrighteously -- ""cowtown"" over San Francisco, the city by the bay, the city where people leave their hearts, sing the blues and honeymoon, drinking Champagne and lime. I could not. And yet, here I was, stopped on the sidewalk in the blistering morning sun, trying to decide if the next step I took was toward something hopeful and necessary or a step away from everything I believed was important to my life. This visit to Columbus was just my latest over the past 18 months. I had started flying into Ohio's capital city from where I lived in San Francisco because it was cheaper than flying into Dayton, my true hometown, some 75 miles to the west, where my father lie battling pancreatic cancer. Ours had been a complicated relationship, distant and wary. But in his final months, the past didn't matter. I understood -- finally -- that I wanted to be a daughter who sat by his side as often as I could until the very end because that's who I was, not because I thought it would make him the kind of father I wanted him to be. After he died, everything shifted. San Francisco, where I had lived for the past six years working as a food writer and restaurant critic, no longer felt like home. Wednesday's story: Can you vacation in your hometown? How was that possible? The job, the life, the city itself represented everything I had dreamed of from the moment I had shut the door on my family and Ohio more than a decade before to first move to California. I had flittered all over the Golden State before finally landing in San Francisco, a city that quickly enchanted me with its fog and food. And yet now, in these months since my father's death, I felt empty and lost. The city didn't seem to sparkle as brightly; my job no longer offered the glow of accomplishment it once had. I continued to make pilgrimages to the Midwest, longing for closeness to my sister who was starting to build her family and to a life that I somehow believed would be simpler than the one I was living on the West Coast. Isn't that what so many of us are looking for when we consider moving home: an ease to living without complications, a time from our childhood when our concerns were no bigger than the towering soft serve ice cream cones we tried to balance while riding our bikes? So I stood now on Grandview Avenue, with the aroma of coffee beckoning me to move forward, and a voice in my head telling me I should stay. I could, of course, live here. I could quit my job with the Chronicle, pack up my studio apartment and drive to Columbus. I could find a job writing or cooking or something. And I could settle into what I imagined would be a quiet existence. Because that's what it would be if I moved to Columbus, right? Just a simple life in my hometown state with the pop-up thunderstorms and fireflies of summer followed by college football games and Christmas with snow. I believed Ohio would not include traffic or crazy housing prices. I had myself convinced that the endless search for the next best restaurant or food trend would cease, too, because I would be finished with the food writing part of my career. And the snob I had become said I would be through with drama of relationships because there couldn't possibly be anyone that could hold my interest or steal my heart in central Ohio. It all sounded so appealing, in those early weeks of grief after losing my second parent (my mother had died years before). I took the plunge: I did quit my job and move to Columbus a few months after that summer morning. But aside from the fireflies and football and snow, none of it turned out as I envisioned. The traffic here can be brutal, and the housing prices in the past 10 years have fluctuated wildly. I'm still chasing stories, mostly about food, just now at the Columbus Dispatch. My desire to be close to family actually included making one of my own. I married a widower with three young children -- because my heart was stolen by not one person but by four. Very few things about motherhood in general are simple or quiet and, I could argue, that's doubly true with stepmotherhood. Some might say -- and I do -- that the voice I heard on the sidewalk on that day wasn't my own internal longing, but was capital ""g"" God calling me to a new life. I wasn't called away. And I didn't run away. The middle of Ohio didn't turn out to be my escape, but it was the beginning of a new kind of life. Not one of tranquility -- in fact often the opposite -- but one that forces me to focus outward toward my family and my faith, not inward on my own fears and thoughts of self-importance.

"London (CNN) -- His ambition was to get a six-pack before he turned 25 years old. With just nine months to go, time was running out. In his quest for a healthier lifestyle, Edwin Broni-Mensah embarked on a grueling fitness regime requiring him to consume four to five liters of water a day. And from this sparked an an idea that could improve access to water not just in the his native UK, but also 4,000 miles away in Ghana. ""(Britain has) some of the best water in the world. And yet once you leave your house, you are encouraged to drink it out of a plastic bottle rather than just being able to get free water,"" says Broni-Mensah. ""So I thought 'How can I improve on people's accessibility (in the UK), get a six pack simultaneously and then help provide that same benefit to people around the world?"" he chuckles . The Manchester-based PhD student's response was to launch GiveMeTap -- a sustainable water scheme where people can buy stainless steel water bottles and refill them using a network of cafes and restaurants across Britain. Using this concept, Broni-Mensah aimed to cut down plastic waste and use the profits from the sale of GiveMeTap water bottles to build water projects in Africa. ""Here is a product and viable service (that can) directly impact the lives of people in Africa where there are some 300 million people without water,"" he says. ""(People) can save money, reduce the amount of plastic wastage that gets discarded into landfills and ultimately for every bottle that we sell we are able to help another person get access to clean drinking water."" Four years on and Broni-Mensah, now 28, is as enthusiastic about GiveMeTap as ever. The energetic young entrepreneur has moved his social initiative out of his parents house, down to London's Google Campus. He now has a dedicated squad working with him. As they work among other aspiring entrepreneurs at the communal startup space, GiveMeTap -- which also relies heavily on award grants and corporate partnerships to provide additional funding for Africa projects -- has now successfully signed up around 300 UK cafes and restaurants. ""We've won 14 business awards and that has helped us to keep investing, to keep scaling but it's also about getting the message out to people,"" says Broni-Mensah. ""That's our role we need to grow quickly."" To date, GiveMeTap has been able to build four water projects in Ghana, Malawi and Namibia with another four projects to be constructed in Ghana from December. ""My parents are both Ghanaian so being able to go back to Ghana eight weeks ago was really emotional,"" he says. ""It was really important to go back to the places where my dad had grown up and wasn't able to get the same benefits (I had). ""There's some 3.5 million people in Ghana that don't have access to clean drinking water. We're trying to reduce that number in a very focused way at the moment because it helps us learn but it also helps us get a direct impact in a small community."" Broni-Mensah's heritage is a driving force behind his passion for providing aid to Africa but he stresses that his sustainable water initiative is not a parachute enterprise. While on the ground, the GiveMeTap team elects a local water committee which is in charge of collecting funds to sustain the pumps so that each project is not donor-dependent. ""If something breaks they need to be able to be self-sufficient which is really important,"" says Broni-Mensah. ""You see more and more NGO-types that are trying more to empower the people to do things themselves because that's how you get long-lasting impact. ""I love going back because it's encouraging for more black people to go back from the diaspora to help African communities. Black people helping black people is an amazing thing. It builds more trust between us as people."" Outside of Africa, Broni-Mensah continues to push the GiveMeTap ethos and build up the free water refill participation network. He hopes to have 1,000 UK-based establishments signed up in addition to branching out internationally. ""We are looking to grow across the whole of the United Kingdom ... once we've done that, (move) into European markets and in America. ""Social entrepreneurship is the future where you will see more and more organizations solving a social mission at the core but through a business mechanism."" And in case you were wondering, the young entrepreneur did succeed in getting his six-pack.","Edwin Broni-Mensah launched GiveMeTap -- a free water refill network in the UK .

"(CNN) -- The air is crisp, the leaves are falling and animals are starting to prepare for the winter ahead. Pull out your sweaters and hiking boots; it's time for a fall hike. If you haven't done much hiking in the past, have no fear. Hiking aficionado Tony Caligiuri promises plenty of hikes for the novice wishing to spend a couple hours in nature. If you're already a veteran hiker, Caligiuri has several hiking recommendations for you. And if a hike looks to be too much for the beginner in your crowd, consider doing part of a longer hike, turning around and heading back to the starting point for a picnic or snack. Raised on a mushroom farm in Pennsylvania, Caligiuri would wander off into the woods for the day or take an overnight trip with his family and pitch a tent along the way. Now executive director of the National Wildlife Federation's mid-Atlantic region, he hikes like most working people, often squeezing in a half-day or day hike on business trips. That's why he started a blog dedicated to hiking experiences that don't require endurance training. Caligiuri wants to enjoy the experience and perhaps be in good condition for ""a nice steak dinner and a glass of wine"" he says. A hike that tortures his body? Not for him. ""I'm looking for a pleasant experience, not a 50-mile death march,"" he says. ""I'm not trying to prove a point."" Here are some of his fall favorites. Please suggest your own in the comments section below. 1. Grayson Highlands State Park, Virginia . Great views start at the trailhead at Massie Gap parking lot. Hike about three miles up to Rhododendron Gap. The Rhododendron Trail also connects to several of the most scenic miles of the Appalachian Trail. If you're bringing small children along, you can promise them ponies on this hike (just not for riding) as a herd of friendly, wild ponies lives on the mountain. They are visible during the first mile of this walk, so you don't have to go far from your car. There is fencing to prevent them from entering the Appalachian Trail section of the park. 2. White Clay Creek Preserve, Delaware and Pennsylvania . Caligiuri hikes the White Clay Creek Preserve at least a couple times a year. The preserve hugs the border of Pennsylvania and Delaware and is part of the Delaware River watershed. Designated by Congress as a National Wild and Scenic River, White Clay Creek and the surrounding valley offers a nice level hike along the old railbeds (part of a rails-to-trails conversion) and through an old growth forest. Energetic hikers could walk for nearly 10 miles on the gravel walk. While the local trail is actually unnamed at this point, it is a section of the larger Mason Dixon Trail that will eventually roughly follow the Mason Dixon Line. The creek side trail in this park follows the edge of the White Clay Creek for more than six miles from Pennsylvania to Delaware. 3. Old Rag Mountain, Virginia . Old Rag Mountain is in the Shenandoah National Park in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, a couple hours west of Washington. The mountain's eight-mile circuit includes scrambling up rocks and is considered a little more difficult, but a fit 10-year-old could do it, Caligiuri says. ""The reward is top of the mountain, a craggy peak that overlooks the Shenandoah Valley,"" he says. The mountain is close to Washington, so it can get crowded on the weekends during peak fall foliage season. It is a challenging trail, especially for a complete novice. That's why there are warnings about being careful on the trail. But Caligiuri has seen lots of kids hiking the trail and has no hesitation to recommend this to families. ""Just use common sense,"" he says. And read National Park Service advisories. 4. Walker Ranch Loop, Colorado . Part of the Boulder city park system, Walker Ranch is an old ranch five miles from Boulder that's been converted into parkland. The loop is a 7.8-mile circuit hike starting at a peak, hiking down into the river valley and back up another peak. It's considered difficult. 5. Salt Point State Park, California . A two-hour drive north of San Francisco, Salt Point State Park offers hikers the chance to walk along the cliffs of the Pacific Ocean and enjoy sweeping views of the coast. The hike can be done as a five-mile loop. The 1.2-mile Salt Point Trail runs along the ocean's edge. It can be combined with the park's north and south upland trails to create a flexible-length loop hike, most of which offers spectacular ocean views. ""You can walk almost five miles through the meadows along these trails,"" says Caligiuri. ""It should be gorgeous right now with the dry wildflowers,"" he says. 6. Point Reyes National Seashore, California . A short drive north of San Francisco, the Point Reyes National Seashore is a very popular park, and Tomales Point is one of its popular hikes, says Caligiuri, who once spotted a golden eagle on this trail. The 11-mile hike is level and provides hikers with ""instant gratification,"" he says. ""You have the bay on the right, the ocean on the left and a view to the rocky point section of the park (at Pierce Point). There's a managed herd of elk within view."" There's also the remains of an old dairy ranch still standing, ""so you can imagine what it would have been like to live on this remote place on the Pacific Ocean,"" he says. 7. Hiking in the big city . Think a hike needs to be in nature? Think again, says Caliguri, who loves to ""hike"" South Street Philadelphia in search of great restaurants and cheese shops. ""I will park at one end, leave a cooler in my car and fill it with cheeses and meat,"" he says. ""With no summer heat, it's a good time to be there."" He also loves to hike in New York City. Think it's not a workout? Walk from Harlem at 125th Street down to Battery Park City in Manhattan and think again. Or walk over the Brooklyn Bridge and enjoy the incredible views of Brooklyn, Manhattan and the East River. ""I will literally go to New York City and walk from one end to the other,"" he says. ""I don't think you have to get into a car to take a hike. A hike is an interesting walk where there are things to see along the way. I grew up in the country, in a rural area. To me, the city is exotic."" Where do you love to hike? It can be anywhere as long as you're moving. Please share your suggestions in comments below.","Hiking aficionado Tony Caligiuri suggests routes for novices and veterans .

"Washington (CNN) -- The year 2013 started off with a fiercely emotional gun-control debate that dominated Washington for months, as both sides felt bolstered and more fervent than ever with the nation stunned by the mass shooting of first graders in Newtown, Connecticut. But that's as far as it would go. A year after the massacre at Sandy Hook elementary, there would be no expanded background checks or other substantial legislative changes in place at the national level. There was yet another school shooting in suburban Denver on Friday, and advocates are still fighting for tougher firearms laws. But attention has shifted to another common root of tragedies like Sandy Hook elementary, the 2011 attack on then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, and the Washington Navy Yard rampage -- a mental health system that many say desperately needs fixing. An alternative route . The Senate Finance Committee approved bipartisan legislation on Thursday that would create pilot programs in 10 states to enhance access to mental health services. The Senate measure, co-authored by Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, and Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, was one of at least three-dozen bills introduced or re-introduced in Congress this year that specifically focused on mental health issues. In the previous two years, or the previous session, about 30 bills were introduced. But none passed the House or Senate. On the other side of Capitol Hill Thursday, a Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania, Tim Murphy, became the latest lawmaker to introduce new legislation specifically tailored to mental health. Murphy, who spent three decades as a psychologist before coming to Congress, said little has been done in the past few decades to get people the help they need. ""This nation has moved forward in knowledge of what it takes to help, but has moved backwards in getting that help done,"" he said this week. ""And where there is no help, there is no hope."" The White House has also been highlighting mental health in the week leading up to the December 14 Newtown anniversary. Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced $100 million in new funding from the Obama administration to improve mental health facilities and community centers. So what changed? On April 18, a divided Senate rejected a measure that would expand background checks to cover purchases at gun shows and over the Internet. Of all the gun control proposals raised in Congress and at the White House, it was considered perhaps the most viable because it was the least aggressive. In the same package, however, an amendment aimed at addressing mental health was backed overwhelmingly by the Senate, 95-2. Three senators voted present. The country was again confronted with a mass shooting in September, this time at the Washington Navy Yard. But the shooting by a lone gunman who killed 12 people hardly moved the dial in the halls of Congress just two miles from the massacre scene. At a memorial service in Washington, Obama gave some of his most forceful remarks in favor of gun control, yet the speech barely made headlines. Predictably, a few lawmakers argued the shooting marked another case for firearm restrictions. But as more information came in out about the shooter's troubled past with mental illness, lawmakers started talking more about mental health. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, helped introduce the Senate amendment that received strong support back in April. She said Friday in a statement to CNN that she has called on Senate leaders to bring the measure for a vote ""immediately."" ""It's clear that this bill could pass with overwhelming bipartisan support,"" she said. The legislation, which was introduced with Democratic Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, would improve mental health training for teachers, emergency personnel, and others in the community. It would also renew suicide prevention programs. States taking charge . Meanwhile, states have been taking on their own steps to boost mental health care all year. State funding for mental health hit major setbacks during the recession. Between 2009 and 2012, states cut $4.35 billion from their budgets for such services, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. But as the economy gradually got better in 2013, states were throwing money back into their mental health systems. Texas allocated a $259 million increase this year; California added $143 million. South Carolina and Illinois also reversed cuts. All told, 36 states and the District of Columbia increased their mental health budgets for fiscal year 2013-2014. Six saw a decrease in funding, while eight remained the same as the year before, according to a report issued by NAMI in late October. State legislatures also passed other laws that centered around increased mental health screening services, especially for children and adolescents, trying to identify problems before they fully manifest, the report said. Outgoing Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell this past week announced an additional $38.3 million for mental health in his state for the next two years. His announcement came less than a month after Democrat Creigh Deeds, his former rival in two statewide elections and a popular state senator, was stabbed repeatedly by his own son, who then shot and killed himself. One day prior, officials said Deeds' son had essentially been turned away from a medical facility because it lacked enough psychiatric beds. Well known in the Washington and Virginia political circles, Deeds' case seemed to resonate in the nation's capital. When Rep. Murphy introduced his new legislation on Thursday, he alluded to the situation. ""No more being 'told there are no more beds, take your son or daughter home' no matter how much they are at risk of hurting you or themselves,"" he said. Will Obamacare make an impact? Mental health advocates say the future also looks promising because of reforms from the Affordable Care Act. With the expansion of Medicaid—the largest public coverage provider for mental health services—in about half the states, an estimated 2.7 million people with mental illnesses could qualify for insurance, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Another 2.6 million with mental illness could qualify for subsidies to buy private health insurance in the marketplaces under Obamacare. Another part of the Affordable Care Act requires small group and individual health plans to cover mental health services at the same rate as general medical care, a practice that's already been in place for larger group plans since 2008. Some critics, however, argue that Medicaid and Medicare are limited in its scope for mental health treatment. For example, certain mental health services will only be reimbursed for those under the age of 21 and older that 65—missing a huge bloc of people. The bill introduced by Murphy on Thursday seeks to fight other policies that permit only one prescription drug per therapeutic class, meaning physicians can't prescribe all the medications they could for certain illnesses under the public programs. Breaking down barriers . The past year has also seen continued efforts at reducing the stigma of mental illness. At a White House conference on mental health this summer, Biden delivered a frank and emotional plea to those fighting mental illness. ""There is nothing, nothing to be ashamed of if you are struggling with mental issues or if your child is or your spouse or your friend,"" he said. ""It's okay. It's okay to talk about it. It's okay to ask for help. It is okay to acknowledge that it is frightening."" The summit also featured celebrities who talked about their own experiences, and the Obama administration launched a new website—mentalhealth.gov—that educates readers on recognizing signs of mental illness and directing them on how to get help. Breaking down the stigma of mental illness has been a White House mission for more than a decade. In 1999, President Bill Clinton's administration held the first White House conference on mental health, and President George W. Bush continued the tradition. ""Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of,"" Clinton said, when he first announced the conference. ""But stigma and bias shame us all.""","Newtown massacre a year ago prompted hope among gun control advocates for action .
But Congress did not approve tougher measures, including expanded background checks .
Now, there is some movement on legislative proposals to bolster mental health services .

It is hard to comprehend that this mass of charred metal, broken seats, bits of galleys and cabins, and the piles of personal belongings, was once our office in the sky. This was our workspace -- and our home, for however many hours. It was a place where we felt safe as we served meals and drinks, carried out safety-related duties, and caught up with our colleagues and friends, laughing and joking about all the latest gossip on ""Galley FM."" For an airline to suffer two unspeakable tragedies in just four months is beyond comprehension. Twenty-one Malaysia Airlines flight attendants and six flight crew have been lost, after the still unexplained disappearance of flight MH370 and the shooting down of MH17. It is a testament to the carrier's staff that the airline is still operating a full schedule of flights. It is difficult to imagine how the crews left behind are still managing to put on their sarong-style uniforms, paint on a smile and go about their duties as normal, after losing so many of their friends and colleagues. To show our solidarity, one week after the loss of MH17, flight attendants everywhere are pinning a small black ribbon to their uniform; to remember our newest angels of the sky. Can we carry on? Recently, I have been contacted by many crew members who are unsure if they can continue their flying careers. Unfortunately, there are no words of wisdom for them, no way to take away the pain or the fear many feel over a disaster like this. Many crew feel it is their duty to keep flying; a tribute to our fallen colleagues who never made it home; to keep doing the job they loved and doing it to the best of their ability. I know a number of flight attendants and pilots who have been involved in accidents. Some have managed to return to the skies, others have hung up their wings for good. Some have used their experiences to improve safety in the industry, helping to ensure tragic incidents are as rare as humanly possible. The thought crosses our mind every day when we board our aircraft: ""What would we do should the worst happen?"" It's part of our job to think this way. Despite many people's belief that we are there just to serve tea and coffee, or to act as a verbal punching bag when something goes wrong, the primary reason we are on board is safety. Every take-off, every landing, every pre-flight briefing, we run through our emergency procedures in our heads. How would we deal with a decompression? An evacuation? A ditching? A medical emergency? Thankfully, most of us will never have to deal with these events or use the weeks, sometimes months, of training we've had to save lives. Sadly, the crew of Flight MH17 didn't even get the chance to help their passengers or colleagues. Innocent lives of innocent people wasted in the blink of an eye. The moment MH17 hit home . Last Thursday, when news of the crash broke, I was operating a flight into Amsterdam, from where flight MH17 had left just a few hours earlier. There was an odd feel about the place and the usual buzz of an airport was gone. As we boarded the flight, one gentleman in particular appeared very upset. When I went to see if he was OK he told me that four of his friends had been on the flight. Then he burst into tears. I was speechless, the full impact of this tragedy hit me and all I wanted to do, like so many other flight attendants that day, was to get home and see my family and friends and tell them I loved them. Much has been made recently of flight attendants being one big family. It has been very moving to see, via my blog and social media, the outpouring of love and support to our fallen brothers and sisters at Malaysia Airlines, and more recently TransAsia Airways after Wednesday's crash in Taiwan. And then, almost unbelievably, Thursday's crash of an Air Algerie flight in Mali. Strong bonds in the air . It doesn't matter what uniform you wear, what aircraft you work on, whether you fly for a low-cost carrier or work in first class, we are united together and become a source of constant support in times of need. Tight bonds form with your airline colleagues, as you are locked in a metal tube with these people for hours on end; bonds I have never known outside of the industry. I hope to extend the black ribbon idea to one day each year, where flight attendants around the world can remember our fallen colleagues.

"New York (CNN) -- I wouldn't necessarily call myself a true germaphobe, but if entering a domestic partnership with a bottle of Purell were legal I'd certainly consider it. Perhaps this is that slippery slope they've warned us about. But it's true. I'm one among the insane masses who is chronically over-sanitizing himself because -- whoa -- it's possible that a lone speck of someone else's butt germs somehow drifted into my three-foot personal safety zone and is now infecting my life with disease and disgust. This, says the guy who will happily eat an unidentifiable rolling tube of meat under a heat lamp at a 7-Eleven. ""And, uh, how about three of those things."" ""Sir, they've been there for 16 hours."" ""I see. Better make it four."" The point, here is that bathrooms gross me out, and people gross me out, and, though it's all completely irrational, this mild phobia is getting to the point where, for safety, I may have to consider wearing pants in public. Of course, the biggest concern for most germaphobes is the dreaded public bathroom. While many people in the world would be overjoyed just to have public bathrooms, here we're socially conditioned to be a little worrisome of any place where another human being and his lunch burrito may have had their final intimate encounter. However, in New York City that soon may not be a problem. A company called POSH Stow and Go is aiming to change all that with upscale, private bathrooms. The idea is this: Customers pay a yearly $15 membership fee. After that, they can then purchase different packages that range from three days ($24) to six days ($42) to 10 days ($60). And this includes free use for up to three children under the age of 18. Unfortunately, if you have four kids, it's like a really bad remake of ""Sophie's Choice."" ""Suzy, Esther, Julius ... let's go inside and use the potty. Er, Billy, good luck out there. Breathe."" POSH's founder, Wayne Parks, explains why this might be perfect for tourists. ""Everyone who visits Manhattan needs a home base,"" he says. ""We will keep building locations as membership grows, so anyone can have a home base in every section of town they find themselves."" Right now, the plan is to launch three flagship POSH locations this summer, situated near the South Street Seaport, Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal. So, being that I was in New York for a work trip, I decided to visit one of these areas to see just what kind of options already exist. And I started right in the heart of it all at: Grand Central. On the main level of the terminal, I didn't immediately see any signs for public bathrooms. But I asked. And they do exist. Downstairs. Lower level. Perfectly adequate. The floors could be cleaner, and it had a slight odor of asparagus, but the loo at Grand Central is certainly passable considering thousands of people pass through each day, and some of them may have had shepherd's pie for lunch. I'm also told there is a super (no longer) secret women's bathroom in the Metro North station master's office. The secret men's bathroom is on Track 32. Literally on Track 32. I think. Now, it's worth mentioning, of course, that the Grand Central POSH Stow and Go location won't be directly in the terminal. It's going to be near the terminal. Thus, I decided to get outside and do a full lap of the property -- one time around the block -- vowing to stop in five different private establishments to see if I could make use of their facilities without being a customer. Which is sort of a debatable practice. Last year, The Consumerist ran a poll on whether restaurants should allow non-customers to use the bathroom. About 36% said yes, but only if the individual was in obvious discomfort. Surprisingly, only 12% said flat-out NO. So, looking back on it, I don't feel that bad, and, amazingly (at least at 3:30 pm on a Wednesday) there was absolutely zero trouble finding a place that would let me use the toilet. I even had a backup line to express my desperation -- something about a bad street-cart gyro. It was very convincing. But I definitely went five for five, dressed in jeans, a wool hat and a puffy winter coat. So, nothing fancy. Nothing filthy. Just normal tourist attire. Which is to say schleppy. And for those of you keeping score, know that I rated the bathroom at La Fonda del Sol a 9.5 out of 10 based on cleanliness, smell and lack of other people. That last part was important. I like privacy. And so does the founder of POSH Stow and Go. ""I unabashedly admit that I'm bathroom-shy. I don't want to hear anyone else's business,"" Parks says. Which is why the bathrooms at POSH will be soundproofed with music, solid core doors and sound-deadening walls. There also will be some heavy duty ventilation. But as the name suggests, POSH Stow and Go will be more than just bathrooms. Members will also be able to stow their bags in secure lockers or just have a quiet rest in a comfortable chair. Which is nice. But the big question is whether this business model will actually work. It's New York. Rent isn't cheap. However, Parks is confident that if he builds it, members will come. ""I have yet to talk to anyone who prefers a dirty bathroom,"" he says. ""It will be profitable if there are enough people like me that don't like lugging business presentation materials, shopping bags, diaper bags, etc. around the city."" Of course, if it doesn't work, there's always Track 32. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.","For a small fee, a new startup will offer visitors to NYC a clean, private bathroom .

"(CNN) -- ""I saw these seats before the tournament began but it's not a good way to deal with it. It's a kind of segregation,"" explains Dr. Guilherme Cotta, a bariatric (weight-loss) surgeon in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Cotta is referring to the 4,750 extra-wide seats made available in the stadiums of this year's World Cup to accommodate Brazil's burgeoning obesity problem. Set aside at the ends of rows throughout the stadium, the low-backed, wide-set seats for obese people have been built in accordance with Brazilian law, in which obesity is classed as a disability and must be accommodated. After their national team's humiliating exit from the World Cup, Brazilians' immediate concerns might be the country's footballing future, rather than its health, but obesity has become mainstream in Brazilian society and is continuing to rise. In 2012, around one in seven Brazilians were classed as obese. Globally, Brazil is far behind countries such as the United States and Mexico, where around a third of people are obese, but the concern is the rapid rate of weight gain. The country once vulnerable to malnutrition and the associated health impacts, such as impaired growth, is instead now vulnerable to obesity and resulting heart disease and diabetes. In 1975 just 19% of Brazilian men and 29% of Brazilian women were overweight: In 2014 those figures are now 54% and 48% respectively. ""The transition to becoming overweight has been rapid in the whole of Latin America over the past 20 years and countries have gone from having below 10% of their population overweight to over 50%,"" explains Ricardo Uauy, Professor of Public Health Nutrition at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ""Brazil is very diverse -- in the south it is like Europe but in the north you have regions of poverty and then in the Amazon basin you have rural indigenous populations,"" he explains. ""But all over the country low-income populations have become dependent on food that is high in both carbohydrates and sugars."" This change in consumption has led to a rapid change in weight and therefore health. Cotta operates on obese people who come to him with no other hope, in a country once known for its beautiful beach bodies. ""When I first started as a bariatric surgeon I had maybe one patient a week, but now I have five to 10 per week"" explains Cotta, who has been treating obese patients for 10 years. ""At first it was people wanting to be beautiful again, but now people are coming from across the country with a sense to be healthy."" Bariatric surgery involves a range of surgical procedures with the overall aim of reducing a patient's appetite and food consumption. It is, in Cotta's eyes, a last resort for patients who have become ""morbidly obese"" and is not for those who are simply overweight. The key to helping them is a change in diet and consumption habits, which have changed extensively in recent years. Uauy puts it down to changes in the food people now have access to. ""Healthy foods have become more expensive,"" he says. Communities across the country -- both urban and rural -- have reduced their intake of fruit and vegetables to include more meat, sugar and processed foods. Globalization has enabled even the most rural of residents to access processed foods; Nestle, for example, has provided scheduled boats since 2010 that serve as floating supermarkets for communities residing along the Amazon. Remote communities can now buy branded goods and often to choose those instead of local farm produce. ""In Brazil, being thin is associated with poverty, so culture has accepted being heavier as a desirable trait,"" says Uauy. This dramatic change in food culture has made cardiovascular disease and stroke the leading cause of death in the country according to Uauy -- followed closely by diabetes. Public health teams are calling for a change in attitudes towards health. ""The healthy choices need to become the easy choices,"" explains Uauy. ""The poor are growing as fast as the rich and everyone needs to understand more about what they are eating."" This isn't a problem unique to Brazil. However, the Brazilian government, and ministry of health, are taking the matter seriously and have been heralded for their recent projects issuing food guidelines for the public and creating programs for schools to source 40% of their food locally as childhood obesity is approaching adult levels. Cotta believes in the power of changing national eating habits. ""Surgery is a radical way to treat obesity and only for the patients I see, for which it is a necessity to live,"" he says. But he believes it may be necessary to target key populations at first. ""Morbid obesity is concentrated inside the city so we need to make changes there.""","More than half of Brazilians are now overweight and 1 in 7 are obese .

"(CNN) -- American Samoans have every right to be frustrated. The United States laid claim to these eastern islands of a South Pacific archipelago in 1900, and since that time, American Samoans have served in the U.S. military, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet, those born in American Samoa receive passports declaring the holder is only a U.S. national, not a U.S. citizen. Noncitizen residents complain they are unable to vote in national elections or to work in jobs that require citizenship status. They also claim their birth status renders them ineligible for federal work-study programs in college, firearm permits and travel/immigration visas. If they want to become citizens, American Samoans must relocate to another part of the United States to initiate the naturalization process, pay a $680 fee and be subjected to a moral character assessment, fingerprinting and the English/civics examination. Quite a process to become citizens of the nation that they consider their home. American Samoans indeed have every right to be frustrated. However, they have zero legal right to be U.S. citizens. While it's true that they would likely win their case in nearly every court of public opinion, they will ultimately lose in all the courts that count: actual courts of law. As with many things, when it comes to citizenship, little is guaranteed to residents of the Territories. American Samoans have challenged federal laws and policy that decline to grant citizenship. The federal district court in the District of Columbia granted the government's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, but the D.C. Circuit, the appellate court, is giving the American Samoans another chance to argue their case. The last American frontier . The U.S. Territories are the last American frontier. They are as rugged as the Wild West and arguably as picturesque. Because of patchwork governance and varying isolation from the mainland, their outward appearances run the gamut: from teeming, vibrant quasi-state to desolated, sun-blasted rock, all scattered to the corners of the globe. So what of the residents of these Territories? They are people like you or me. Are they U.S. citizens? Or -- like the soil on which they live -- are they considered another ""possession"" of the United States? The short answer is: They are whatever Congress wants them to be. Whether that sounds fair or not, there's little to dispute legally. Territorial residents are not without any constitutional protections. The Supreme Court defined the extent to which the Constitution applies in Territories in a series of cases known to those of us who live or work in the Territories as the Insular Cases. These cases held that only specific ""fundamental"" constitutional rights are guaranteed to Territorial inhabitants. The question then is whether the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment applies to American Samoans. The Citizenship Clause provides that ""[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" American Samoa is certainly ""subject to the jurisdiction"" of the United States. But residents must also be born ""in the United States"" for the constitutional right to attach. Unfortunately, for 14th Amendment citizenship purposes, the Territories have never been considered ""in the United States."" No federal court has ever recognized birthright citizenship as a guarantee in unincorporated Territories. In fact, federal courts have held on many occasions that unincorporated Territories are not included within the ""United States"" for purposes of the Citizenship Clause. Because these residents have no Constitutional, automatic right to citizenship, Congress can pick and choose how they become citizens. In fact, it has done just that: granting citizenship at birth to residents of other Territories. For example, residents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are citizens if born there. But that citizenship does not flow from any constitutional right. Rather, Congress has chosen to pass independent legislation giving those residents citizenship. Indeed, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court observed in one opinion that the only remaining noncitizen nationals are residents of American Samoa and Swains Island. When it comes to citizenship in the Territories, Congress can giveth or it can choose not to giveth, and the Constitution gives those residents no recourse. Annexation and inconvenience? The public policy is clear. Courts have been reluctant to force Congress to grant citizenship to persons merely because the U.S. has annexed their homeland. Courts and the legislature alike cite the practical inconvenience to the federal government. The theory: If the practice of acquiring Territories required endowing the inhabitants with citizenship of the United States, this would be too great an inconvenience to the government. Then again, imagine the inconvenience to the newly annexed inhabitants who suddenly find themselves without citizenship anywhere. American Samoans have fought in our armed services for over a century, so it feels fundamentally unfair that they get short shrift when it comes to citizenship. The problem is, fairness cannot overcome the language of the Constitution and centuries of legal precedent. Fair or not, American Samoans will likely lose this legal battle, even though the Court of Appeals has given them a glimmer of hope and a second chance, of sorts. Citizenship for them is not a constitutional right; it cannot be grafted onto them by any court. Only Congress can choose to grant citizenship to Territorial inhabitants. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Danny Cevallos.","Danny Cevallos: American Samoans are right to be frustrated .
He says Samoans are suing the federal government to get citizenship rights .
Constitution gives the power to make that decision to Congress, he says .

"(CNN) -- A forceful Mitt Romney went toe-to-toe with President Barack Obama on the dominant issues for voters, challenging the Democrat's policies on the economy, taxes and health care in the first of three debates ahead of the November election. In exchanges full of policy proposals, facts and figures, the Republican challenger was more aggressive in the 90-minute encounter in criticizing Obama's record and depicting the president's vision as one of big government. The president firmly defended his achievements and challenged his rival's prescriptions as unworkable. Neither candidate scored dramatic blows that will make future highlight reels, and neither veered from campaign themes and policies to date. But Romney came off as the more energized candidate overall by repeatedly attacking Obama on red-meat issues for Republicans such as health care reform and higher taxes, while the president began with lengthy explanations and only later focused more on what his opponent was saying. Moderator Jim Lehrer of PBS, at times, tried without success to keep the candidates within time limits for responses, especially Obama, who ended up speaking four minutes longer than Romney. ""A week ago, people were saying this was over. We've got a horse race,"" said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, who called the debate Romney's best so far after the 22 the former Massachusetts governor took part in during the GOP primary campaign. Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor, expressed surprise at Romney's strong performance, saying he ""rose to the moment"" and seemed to benefit from the multiple primary debates. ""It looked like Romney wanted to be there and President Obama didn't want to be there,"" noted Democratic strategist and CNN contributor James Carville. ""The president didn't bring his 'A' game."" A CNN/ORC International poll of 430 people who watched the debate showed 67% thought Romney won, compared to 25% for Obama. Romney's strongest moments came in repeating his frequent criticism of Obama's record, saying the nation's high unemployment and sluggish economic recovery showed the president's policies haven't worked. ""There's no question in my mind if the president is re-elected, you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze,"" Romney said, adding that another term for Obama also will mean the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, ""will be fully installed."" At another point, he noted how $90 billion spent on programs and policies to develop alternative energy sources could have been devoted to hiring teachers or other needs that would bring down unemployment. Obama argued that his policies were working to bring America back from the financial and economic crisis he inherited, and that Romney refused to divulge specifics about his proposed tax plans and replacements for the health care reform act and Wall Street reform act that the Republican has pledged to repeal. ""At some point, the American people have to ask themselves if the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans secret is because they're too good,"" Obama said. What questions went unanswered? Share your thoughts with CNN iReport . On taxes, Obama said Romney's plan of tax cuts for the rich had failed before and would fail again now. Describing the Romney tax plan as a $5 trillion cut, Obama echoed a line from former President Bill Clinton by saying the math doesn't add up without increasing tax revenue, which Romney rejects . ""I think math, common sense and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth,"" Obama said. Romney, however, said Obama still pushed the same policies as when he took office four years earlier, and those steps had failed to bring down high unemployment and get the economy surging again. He rejected Obama's characterization of his tax plan, saying it won't add to the deficit, and criticized the president's call for allowing tax rates on income over $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals to return to the higher rates of the 1990s. ""The National Federation for Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs. I don't want to cost jobs,"" Romney said. Obama responded that the revenue issue is ""a major difference"" he has with Romney, noting the former Massachusetts governor rejected the idea of cutting $10 in spending for every $1 in new revenue during the Republican primary campaign. Complete coverage: CNN's election center . In his strongest line of the night, Obama said Romney lacked the important leadership quality of being able to say ""no"" when necessary. ""I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party,"" Obama said in reference to his challenger's swing to the right during the primaries to appeal to the GOP's conservative base. Romney repeatedly went after Obama on the health care reform bill, at one point asking why the president focused so strongly on a measure that passed with no Republican support instead of devoting more attention to the high unemployment and creaking economy. With polls narrowing less than five weeks before Election Day, Obama and Romney launched a new phase in a bitter race dominated so far by negative advertising as both camps try to frame the election to their advantage. Whether it matters is itself a topic of debate. According to an analysis by Gallup, televised debates have affected the outcome of only two elections in the past half century -- Nixon-Kennedy in 1960 and Bush-Gore in 2000. Debates by the numbers . Both candidates had their wives in the audience at the University of Denver in Colorado for the debate taking place on the 20th wedding anniversary of the president and first lady Michelle Obama. Obama opened the debate by promising his wife they wouldn't be celebrating their anniversary next year in front of 40 million people, and Romney joked that Obama found the most romantic place possible for the anniversary. Analysts say Obama needed a presidential performance rather than fireworks or haymakers in order to maintain and build on a narrow edge in polls that indicate a very close election on November 6. Romney, who has been unable to catch the president in most of the polls to date, sought to generate enthusiasm for a change in the White House as the nation wrestles with seemingly chronic economic problems such as mounting federal deficits and debt. 5 things to watch in tonight's debate . Lehrer, moderating his 12th presidential debate, planned to break up the debate into 15-minute segments focusing on different aspects of the economy and other domestic issues. However, the exchanges by the candidates scrambled the format, with the opening discussion on taxes lasting more than 20 minutes. Debate time: The candidates' version of the two-minute drill . The two candidates shook hands and shared a laugh after being introduced by Lehrer as the audience applauded before being asked to remain silent for the remainder of the debate. At one point, a loud bang off-stage seemed to surprise Romney in mid-sentence, and Obama looked behind him to try to see what happened. The other presidential debates will occur on October 16 in New York and October 22 in Florida. Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Romney's running mate, will debate on October 11 in Kentucky. Where they stand: The candidates and their positions .

"(CNN) -- Spider-Man may be getting a female counterpart. Sony -- the studio behind the ""Spider-Man"" films -- has confirmed it's at work developing a project for a female superhero in the Spider-Man universe, a source close to negotiations told CNN. The female superhero film would likely come out in 2017, according to Deadline.com and The Hollywood Reporter. The trade publications report that Lisa Joy has been tapped to write the script and Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach are producing. The decision is driven by a number of factors, according to the industry publications. First, female superheroes are becoming more common, what with Wonder Woman joining the ""Batman v Superman"" cast, Scarlett Johansson's popular turn as Black Widow in Marvel's ""Avengers"" film and Marvel's recent announcement of a female Thor. New Wonder Woman draws mixed reaction . Moreover, audiences have responded to women-led action films. Johansson's ""Lucy"" debuted at the top of the box office its opening weekend and stayed strong in its second week, finishing No. 2 behind ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ahead of ""Get on Up"" and the Dwayne ""Rock"" Johnson-led ""Hercules."" No word on which character will be the protagonist in the new film, though there has been a Spider-Woman, an identity adopted by several characters. The next ""Spider-Man"" film has been pushed back to 2018, so Sony is filling the gap with other films from the character's world. According to the trades, first up will be ""Sinister Six,"" which puts the Spider-Man villains together in one film. Drew Goddard -- who oversaw ""The Cabin in the Woods"" -- is writing and directing the film, which has a release date set for 2016. Though Spider-Man is a Marvel character, Sony's Columbia Pictures has released the Sam Raimi and Marc Webb films featuring the webslinger, including 2014's ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2.""

"Cairo (CNN) -- Hours after being declared his nation's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi vowed late Sunday to represent all Egyptians, and he urged his countrymen to put aside their differences and come together for the common good. ""This national unity is the only way to get Egypt out of this difficult crisis,"" Morsi said in a nationally televised speech. The longtime Muslim Brotherhood member paid special tribute to those ""martyrs"" who helped spearhead the revolution that led to the ouster of Egypt's longtime President Hosni Mubarak and, more than a year later, to Morsi's election. Mohamed Morsi's top challenges . He expressed thanks and admiration for military personnel, police officers, judges and others in the Egyptian government for their work on behalf of the nation. ""I must salute them because they have a role in the future"" of Egypt, Morsi said. The president-elect also promised ""we will preserve all national and international agreements,"" a topic of concern in light of questions about how his election might affect Egypt's ties with neighboring Israel. And he vowed to ""protect the rights of women and children,"" as well as Christians and Muslims alike. Earlier in the day, election officials announced Morsi earned more than 13 million votes in last week's presidential election, while Ahmed Shafik -- the last prime minister to serve under Mubarak -- had more than 12 million. That worked out to just under 52% of the vote for Morsi, while Shafik got just over 48%, officials said. The announcement triggered massive cheers and celebratory gunfire in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the hub of last year's revolution, with temperatures near 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) failing to subdue the joy felt by Morsi's supporters. Similar rallies erupted Sunday in Alexandria as well. ""We've been waiting for it for 7,000 years,"" said Abdul Mawgoud Dardery, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. ""For the first time in history, we have our own president, elected by us. The power of the people is now in the hands of the president -- and the president has to go and move forward."" Added another man celebrating in Tahrir Square, ""What we are happy for is Egyptian people could overcome the remnants of the last regime."" Are you there? Share your images . Yet some Shafik supporters were crushed by the news. Manal Koshkani told CNN from a Cairo hotel that she and others ""fear"" the direction the Islamist party, the Muslim Brotherhood, could take Egypt. ""I hope we see a better future"" Morsi, she said, adding, ""I highly doubt it."" Egypt does not have a constitution, while military rulers dissolved parliament in the wake of a controversial and pivotal court ruling earlier this month. Moreover, the presidency as currently defined is largely a figurehead position as the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) maintains much of the control over the country, as it has since Mubarak's exit. For this reason, a young Egyptian man named Mohamed Saleh dismissed the importance of the presidential vote. ""(Morsi) doesn't have the power -- SCAF has the power,"" he said. Yet Morsi, who resigned from the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party shortly after the results were announced in an apparent effort to send a message that he will represent all Egyptians, said late Sunday that he is ""in charge"" thanks to the vote, while stressing he must answer to the people. ""We are all equal in rights, and we all have obligations to carry on for this country,"" he said. ""As for myself, I have no rights, but I have obligations."" Like Mubarak, Shafik is a former air force officer with close ties to Egypt's powerful military and was ""the quintessential candidate of the counterrevolution,"" said Khaled Elgindy, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Morsi, an American-educated engineer, ""represents the older, more conservative wing of the Brotherhood and openly endorses a strict Islamic vision,"" said Isobel Coleman of the Council on Foreign Relations -- a view Morsi seemed to try to rebut in his speech Sunday. Both presidential candidates claim victory in Egypt . Among others, his victory raised questions about how it might affect Egypt's relations with Israel. Morsi didn't directly address Israel on Sunday, though he did promise to maintain ""agreements."" He previously told CNN he'd honor Egypt's 1979 accord with Israel but in the past, the Islamist figure has referred to Israeli leaders as ""vampires."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement Sunday, said, ""Israel appreciates the democratic process in Egypt and respects the results of the presidential elections. Israel looks forward to continuing cooperation with the Egyptian government on the basis of the peace treaty between the two countries, which is a joint interest of both peoples and contributes to regional stability."" Meanwhile a prominent Palestinian legislator, Hanan Ashrawi, said Palestinians ""look for future corporation with Egypt and its supportive position for the Palestinian cause."" She added that ""the democratic process in Egypt should be propelled"" by a movement to help it regain ""its leadership in the Arab world and region."" Both campaigns had accused each other of fraud leading up to last weekend's runoff election. And well before the official announcement, the two candidates both used social media to declare victory -- a claim they repeated, once again, early Sunday. The results were expected to be announced earlier in the week, but were pushed back to Sunday. Even then, the head of the Supreme Presidential Election Commission kept people waiting -- after beginning 45 minutes later than expected, he took 45 minutes before finally announcing Morsi the victor. Afterward, leaders from the country, region and world sent in their congratulations. They included Egypt's Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa and the head of the Al Azhar religious authority Ahmed al-Tayeb, who both congratulated Morsi, according to state-run media. The two are key Muslim figures in the country who were appointed by Mubarak. U.S. President Barack Obama called Morsi to congratulate him and pledge to ""support Egypt's transition to democracy and stand by the Egyptian people as they fulfill the promise of the revolution."" Earlier, the White House issued a statement calling on Morsi ""to take steps at this historic time to advance national unity by reaching out to all parties and constituencies,"" including respecting the rights of women and religious minorities such as Coptic Christians. Others described Morsi's election as momentous but stressed that it doesn't mean the county's ""revolution"" or its problems are over. Egypt's economy continues to struggle, with widespread poverty, high unemployment and its vaunted tourism sector still sagging on the heels of the political unrest. With mass demonstrations and clashes with authorities common, the security situation remains tenuous. Officials warned Sunday -- in advance of the declaration about the presidential winner -- that they were ready to carry out their longstanding policy of using deadly force against people who attack government buildings. More than 1,800 ambulances were dispatched across the county before the announcement in anticipation of election-related violence, the state-run EgyNews agency reported. And even after Morsi's win, the political situation remains very much unsettled amid lingering questions about whether the military will loosen its grip on power. Under an interim constitutional declaration, the military council said it retains the power to make laws and budget decisions until a new constitution is written and a new parliament is elected. The declaration said Supreme Council members ""shall decide all matters related to military affairs, including the appointment of its leaders."" Once sworn in as president, Morsi can declare war but only with ""the approval"" of the Supreme Council. Wrote Wael Ghonim, the then-Google executive who helped organize the 2011 revolution, on Twitter: ""The first elected civilian Egyptian president in the history of modern Egypt. The revolution continues."" Why Mubarak's death wouldn't change Egypt's future .

"(CNN) -- A design studio in the Netherlands has found an imaginative way to encourage its employees to maintain a healthy work-life balance -- at 6 p.m. their desks simply disappear. In the evenings and on weekends, Heldergroen's large communal work tables, which are made from recycled telephone poles, are lifted up into the ceiling on steel cables. The nifty key-operated system allows the Haarlem-based firm to create a new space for other activities, such as networking events, yoga classes and even food festivals. ""We think that doing activities like this makes it easier for people to work here,"" Vincent Stolk, a junior art director at the company, told CNN by email. ""You know when it's time to relax or do something else that inspires you."" With its computers and other belongings tucked up securely in the ceiling, the company makes the space available for free to ""anyone with great ideas and possibilities,"" said Stolk. ""We believe that if you give something ... you will eventually get something back,"" he said. ""But besides that, it's just very cool to elevate your table every single time."" Working smarter, not longer . Heldergroen isn't the first company to find novel ways to create an office culture that promotes working smarter, not longer. Many recent initiatives have focused on redrawing the line between work and play that has been blurred by advances in technology. In 2011, Volkswagen began restricting email access for some of its employees in Germany when they were off duty. French technology company Atos is working towards eliminating internal email use altogether after research found only around of tenth of the emails staff received on an average day were useful. In the Swedish city of Gothenburg, a group of civil servants began scaling back their work day to six hours this summer, as part of a government trial to see whether shorter work days can improve productivity and lead to employees taking fewer sick days. Regional attitudes . Although Europe seems to be leading the charge, attempts to improve productivity and prevent burnout appear to be catching on in other regions. Energy recruitment firm Spencer Ogden has transformed its Singapore office into a quirky space complete with astro-turf floors, miniature golf and a giant opium bed in the ""Not Bored Room."" And if employees hit their targets three months in a row, they're rewarded with an all-expenses-paid week working remotely from an office in Ibiza. But initiatives like these are still very much the exception in Asia, where working hours are notoriously grueling. On average, South Koreans work 2,163 hours per year, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development -- more than any other OECD country except Mexico. In Indonesia last year, a 27-year-old advertising agency writer collapsed and later died after reportedly working excessive hours. Japan even has a word that means ""death from overwork"" (Karoshi). Those working in professional services, such as bankers, consultants, accountants and lawyers are particularly vulnerable, according to Leslie Perlow, a professor of leadership in organizational behavior at the Harvard Business School. She found that some 94% of professionals in these sectors said they worked at least 50 hours a week. A pressure to be ""always on"" is to blame, Perlow wrote in the Harvard Business Review. But even in these industries, it's possible for employees to unplug while also meeting the needs of their clients, she said. Perlow helped the Boston Consulting Group introduce a program where consultants were allocated one day or evening a week where they would not be contacted by colleagues or clients and could turn off their phone and email. ""We found that when the assumption that everyone needs to be always available was collectively challenged, not only could individuals take time off, but their work actually benefited,"" she said.","Desks at a Dutch firm are lifted on cables after hours .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The latest and strongest in a string of powerful storms to hit Japan -- Vongfong -- slammed into Kyushu, the southernmost of the country's four main islands, Monday morning as it continued its destructive path across the country. Vongfong first made landfall in Japan in Okinawa early Sunday. It wreaked havoc across the prefecture, knocking out power before losing strength and being downgraded from a typhoon to a tropical storm. Meteorologists expect the storm to pass over the country's largest island, Honshu, hitting the capital, Tokyo, before dawn on Tuesday. At least 36 injuries related to the storm were reported across Okinawa, Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures, officials said, while at least 44,000 across the country were without power. Authorities have ordered more than 100,000 people to evacuate their homes. Police in Shizuoka said one man remained missing after three people were swept into water on Sunday at the city's port. Although a high-wave advisory had been issued at the time of the accident, the incident was classified as a water accident and not officially linked to the storm, according to Shizuoka police. Flights in and out of Kyushu and neighboring Shikoku were canceled Monday, along with local ferry and train operations. The Japan Meteorological Agency said Vongfong was expected to bring up to 40 centimeters of rain. The storm comes on the heels of Typhoon Phanfone, which swept over southern Japan last week, washing three U.S. airmen out to sea off Okinawa. U.S. and Japanese search crews found the last airman's body on Wednesday, according to a news release issued by authorities at Kadena. Japan was previously saturated by storms Halong, Neoguri and Nakri. CNN's Tom Sater contributed to this report.","Tropical Storm Vongfong hits Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's four main islands .

"(CNN) -- In a warehouse about the size of four football fields, more than a million units of online retail items are housed. It is essential that all inventory is organized and easy to find, in order to get these items to their final destinations on time -- that is, unless the inventory needed can be summoned on demand. That is exactly what happens at the 25,500-square-meter Quiet Logistics fulfillment center, in Massachusetts, where 200 robots help workers prepare 10,000 to 20,000 orders for delivery every day. It uses a system designed by Amazon subsidiary Kiva that keeps track of all inventory so the robots know exactly what is on each storage unit. ""The robots job is really to move inventory from storage to the work station,"" said Brian Lemerise VP of third-party fulfillment at Quiet Logistics. ""Anytime someone places an order ... the robot is dispatched to the storage location that has that unit and brings it to our associates to pick."" Kiva robots have a reported accuracy rate of 99.99%, so human error is practically eliminated in this phase of the process. With names like Bot-Mobile, Jack-in-the-Bot, and Betty-Bot, each robot is given its own identity and its own assignments. Like a choreographed routine they move autonomously up and down the aisles of the warehouse at about 10 kilometers per hour -- never missing a step, and always hitting their mark. This is made possible by the bar codes they drive over and the cameras on the bottom of the drive units, which together communicate where the bot is driving to. They are designed to operate in tight quarters and at just 76 cm long, 64cm wide and 41 cm high, the robots are small enough to travel under the storage units, yet strong enough to lift almost a metric ton of merchandise. They can even find the charging station when their power is running low. What keeps this mechanical workforce performing with such precision -- and from crashing into each other -- is the software that commands it. ""We think of the software as being a giant air traffic control system,"" says Al Dekin, Senior VP of sales and marketing at Quiet Logistics. ""The software will allocate a certain number of spots to a specific robot; that's what keeps the robots from hitting each other"" He adds: ""In terms of overall productivity, the use of the robotics tend to be around anywhere between three-and-a-half to upwards of five times more productive, so we'd have to have that many more people to actually get the same amount of work done."" But the human touch is still necessary to get the products out the door. Quiet Logistics has 400 people working on fulfillment at the Massachusetts facility alone, so these smart machines are not yet ready to replace living workers. But they do make it easier to get the job done.","At online-shopping warehouse, 200 robots help workers dispatch retail orders .

"Washington (CNN) -- The National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee released a tough ad Friday that links the Democratic challenger in a competitive House race in Nebraska to a convicted serial killer. The ad, which comes weeks before voters will decide the fate of incumbent Rep. Lee Terry, slams Democrat Brad Ashford for supporting a ""good time"" law that released convicted robber Nikko Jenkins from prison after he served half his sentence. Jenkins killed four people shortly after his release, a case that was highly publicized in Nebraska. The TV spot opens with a news clip of a shackled Jenkins angrily shouting in the direction of news cameras before a picture of Jenkins' heavily tattooed face next to a shotgun appears on screen. Responding to the ad Ashford's campaign manager, Kurt Gonska, said, ""it's clear that Congressman Terry is fearing for his political life and will say and do anything to keep his $174,000 salary."" The House Democratic campaign arm immediately condemned the spot and called on the NRCC to apologize and pull the ad, which is expected to run for the next week, from the airwaves. ""This repellent, race-baiting ad has no place in America,"" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokeswoman Ashley Lewis said. ""Republicans should be ashamed that they have resorted to divisive rhetoric, playing up racial stereotypes and fear-mongering to save their sinking candidate."" Jenkins is black, and the ad drew immediate comparisons to the 1988 Willie Horton attack ad, which overtly tied Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to the crimes convicted murderer Willie Horton committed while on weekend furlough under Dukakis' governorship. The ad was believed to be wildly effective in compounding claims that Dukakis was soft on crime, but has since been widely repudiated by both the left and right. Republicans don't appear ready to condemn this ad, and NRCC spokesman Tyler Houlton said the committee has no plans to cancel the ad buy. ""Brad Ashford's record on crime is fair game,"" Houlton said, noting that Ashford still defends the law. ""Nebraska voters deserve to know that Brad Ashford supports policies that have made them less safe."" Terry campaign manager Kent Grisham attempted to slightly distance the campaign from the ad, but would not condemn it. ""There's no denying the ad is factual. However, our campaign has made it a point in our advertising not to invoke the names of specific criminals or victims,"" Grisham said. ""Still, the ad reflects the issues of this campaign, one of which is why does Brad Ashford still support the good time law?"" The NRCC expects to spend about $1 million in the contentious Nebraska race. About $170,000 will keep this ad on air for a week.","Campaign ad for Nebraska incumbent Rep.

"(CNN) -- There's a reason for Bono's ever-present orange-tinted sunglasses, and it's not rock-star affectation. ""I have glaucoma,"" he told British talk show host Graham Norton. ""For the last 20 years."" Bono, 54, was on Norton's show with the rest of the band, as well as actors Robert Downey Jr., Robert Duvall and Stephen Fry. Bono's revelation came after Norton showed a couple of the group's early photos featuring Bono without spectacles (and The Edge without his skullcap). Noting the difference between Bono in 1980 and Bono today, he asked, ""Do you ever take (the glasses) off?"" The U2 frontman explained that he had excellent vision, but noticed that objects and lights were accompanied by cloudiness and rings -- an indicator of the condition -- ""and it's not from anything exotic,"" he joked. Glaucoma may lead to blindness, but can be treated with medication or surgery. Bono said there was no need to worry about his health. Explainer: How is glaucoma detected? ""I have good treatments, and I am going to be fine,"" he said. ""You're not going to get this out of your head now, and you will be saying, 'Ah, poor old blind Bono.'

"(CNN) -- The Army psychiatrist who killed 13 people at Fort Hood has written a letter to the leader of ISIS, asking to become a citizen of the Islamic State's caliphate, his attorney said Thursday. ""The letter states that Nadal Hasan wants to become a citizen of the Islamic State caliphate,"" attorney John Galligan said. ""He wrote it in the last few weeks."" Details of the letter were first reported by Fox News on Thursday. Described as a two page letter, it was addressed to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the notorious leader of ISIS who declared himself the caliph -- the religious ruler -- over what he calls the Islamic State that he says stretches from western Syria to eastern Iraq. ""I formally and humbly request to be made a citizen of the Islamic State,"" Hasan wrote in the letter, according to Fox News. ""It would be an honor for any believers to be an obedient citizen soldier to a people and its leader who don't compromise the religion of All-Mighty Allah to get along with the disbelievers."" Hasan is on the military's death row at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Hasan was sentenced to death by a military court for the November 5, 2009, rampage, which authorities said the American-born Muslim carried out because he did not want to deploy to Afghanistan to fight other Muslims. Hasan was an Army major when he carried out the rampage at a deployment center, targeting unarmed soldiers who were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan or just returning. Thirty-two people were also injured in the attack. His rampage was brought to an end when he was shot by two police officers. The shooting left him paralyzed. During his trial, he offered no defense. At one point, he told the judge there was ""adequate provocation"" for the attack because the soldiers were going to participate in ""an illegal war"" in Afghanistan.

"Madrid (CNN) (CNN) -- A man who took a dangerous selfie during the running of the bulls in Pamplona, with the half-ton beasts right behind him, is still on the run -- but this time from the police. The thin, bearded man, so-far unidentified, faces a fine of about $4,100 (3,000 euros) under new Pamplona city rules that aim to make the globally famous bull running slightly safer. The eight consecutive days of running ended on Monday, with a total of 42 people taken to hospital during the week. Among them, eight men who were gored, including three foreigners -- American Bill Hillmann, 32, of Chicago, and two Australians, ages 26 and 24, whose names were not immediately released. The so-called ""selfie man"" escaped injury on the tumultuous fifth day of the running last Friday, but could have caused harm to himself or others, which is why authorities passed the new rules. Carrying any device to record video or take pictures is prohibited during the running, because it distracts the runner from trying to stay out of harm's way, and doing anything that endangers others is considered a serious offense, according to the city's new rules. On Spanish state television's official video of the running, the selfie man is seen toward the end of the 850-meter, or half-mile, course holding a recording device that looks like a phone, high in his right hand. This is just before the bulls enter the bullring on a downhill slope, and the pace is fast. The man appears on the video at one minute and 56 seconds after the run began, on the right of the street, with the bulls a few steps behind. At 01:57, he turns his head, left over his shoulder to glance back at the bulls, still holding the camera, and at 01:58 he starts to head for cover on the left side of the street. He dashes across the street in the middle of oncoming runners -- somehow not colliding with any of them - and he's off camera by 01:59, the video shows. Police have not yet found this man, who was wearing a traditional red long-sleeve top and white pants. The most dangerous day of the running turned out to be the last, on Monday. A brown bull became separated from the pack on a well-known curve, not quite halfway in to the course, and caused havoc. There were just five injuries by goring in the previous seven days, but on the final day, there were three more gorings. These included the two Australian men, with the 26-year-old listed in serious condition with three separate goring wounds, and the 24-year-old receiving a goring to his right thigh; and a 21-year-old Spanish man who was also gored three times. Hillmann, of Chicago, who was gored on the third day of the running in his right thigh, had just co-authored a book, entitled: ""Fiesta, How to Survive the Bulls of Pamplona."" Other contributors to the book include John Hemingway, grandson of Ernest Hemingway, who brought global fame to the ancient tradition though his 1920s novel, ""The Sun Also Rises,"" also published under the title, ""Fiesta.""","Man took a selfie during the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain .

"(CNN) -- The family of Audrie Pott, a California teenager who allegedly was raped and then committed suicide in September, intends to file a wrongful death lawsuit, the family's lawyer told reporters Monday. Three boys were arrested last week in connection with the case, accused of assaulting the 15-year-old girl, taking photos of the attack, posting the pictures online and sharing them at school. The boys are all 16, according to authorities. ""We intend to prove in court of law, that their actions ... broke her. She couldn't handle it, and she did the worst thing a parent can imagine -- she took her life,"" said Robert Allard, attorney for Pott's father, mother and stepmother. Authorities say the three boys are accused of raping Pott at an unsupervised house party in Saratoga, California, in early September. Pott had too much to drink at the party and passed out before the attack, Santa Clara County sheriff's detectives say. She took her own life seven days later, after learning that schoolmates had seen at least one photograph of the attack, Allard said. Related: When images of sex assault go viral . The three unidentified boys face two felony charges and one misdemeanor charge of sexual battery, Santa Clara Sheriff's Office spokesman Jose Cardoza said last week. Formal charges have not been filed. During Monday's press conference, Pott's mother, father and stepmother repeatedly stressed they wanted the 16-year-olds arrested to be referred to as ""young men"" due to the gravity of the allegations. Allard said that the parents who own the home where the alcohol was allegedly consumed will be made defendants in the wrongful death suit. Those parents were out of town but teens had access to a liquor cabinet, Allard said. The case is similar to one that played out in court this year in Steubenville, Ohio, where two star football players were convicted of rape for assaulting a girl who had too much to drink. Images in that case were posted on social media sites. Healing process after rape never ends . In the California case, the boys are accused of taking photos of the attack and sharing them at school, as well as texting them and posting them online. After learning that photos had been posted on the Internet, Pott wrote in an online post that her life was ruined. She took her own life a few days later. During Monday's press conference, stepmother Lisa Pott read messages that the family found on the teen's Facebook page after her suicide. Lisa Pott quoted the girl as writing: . ""My life is ruined."" ""I can't do anything to fix it."" ""I just want this to go away."" ""The whole school knows."" ""I have a reputation I can never get rid of."" ""The boys can die in a hole for all I care."" ""They knew how bad I was."" ""I don't want to remember."" ""I have a reputation for a night I don't even remember."" Lisa Pott told reporters, ""(Audrie) made her feelings clear in the messages (we) were left to find. The three people who were arrested are responsible for her death."" How to help and support young rape victims . Larry Pott said that he wanted other high school students who might know what happened to his daughter -- including those who were witnesses -- to speak up. ""Come forward,"" he said. ""Do the right thing."" He choked up when he spoke about losing his daughter. He explained that the Pott family decided to make Audrie's name public so that ""in some small way ... her story and death could help others."" ""She was so full of life, there was no denying when Audrie walked into a room. She would light it up, always,"" he said. ""Audrie filled our house with family and laughter."" She was witty, her dad said, and loved soccer and the outdoors. ""She was sweet and she was kind,"" he said. ""We miss her every day."" The morning after . Earlier, Lauren Cerri, a Pott family attorney, told CNN affiliate KGO that the teen ""had no idea what occurred until she woke up the following morning and had some drawings on her body and in some private areas."" Rape accusations, teens and Twitter attacks in another U.S. town . A fellow student told KGO that along with the shock of Pott's death, there was chatter about who was involved and how they remained in school. ""That it took that long (for an arrest) was pretty ridiculous,"" Samir Ingle told KGO. ""It was maybe half a year. I find that really, really disturbing."" In the Steubenville case, Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl who had had too much to drink. That trial gained media attention for its lurid text messages, cell phone pictures and videos, and social media posts surrounding the sexual abuse of the girl.

"(CNN) -- Containing the Ebola outbreak sweeping West Africa is plausible -- but action needs to be taken immediately, before affected states potentially collapse and the virus spirals out of control, campaigner Bob Geldof says. ""Even out of self-interest you have to act in these instances,"" Geldof told CNN's Max Foster. ""There is no time-lag between what happens in the poor parts of the world and it affecting us, which is why we have to ... intervene quite radically and effectively and immediately."" Since the outbreak started in March, about 9,000 Ebola cases and 4,493 deaths have been reported, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization. The WHO has warned there could be up to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week across the three hardest-hit nations by the end of the year. Geldof, the musician responsible for coordinating Live Aid concerts to draw attention to famine in Africa in the 1980s, said people starved then because they couldn't grow food and they and their governments had no money to buy any. ""In effect they died of poverty. ""The same is happening now in West Africa. They don't have the doctors, nurses, hospitals, state systems that they have in Texas or Madrid and so once again, through no fault of their own, this virus is out of control in states where there are no systems -- because there is no money,"" he said. In Sierra Leone, one of the nations worst-hit by Ebola, the situation was ""particularly tragic,"" he said. ""Sierra Leone was just getting off its knees, beginning to breathe, the economy was beginning to have traction and people were beginning to get well educated, hospitals were being built,"" Geldof said. ""You could be looking at -- some people think -- some sort of state collapse, which would be utterly unthinkable because the disease itself, should that happen, would then spiral away by itself."" But Geldof was hopeful the spread of the virus could be halted. ""With the right will, the right level of commitment, this can be contained. The issue is, will it be contained in time to stop these states collapsing and then other evils -- human evils -- emanating from that,"" he said. ""I've been briefed on what the response is and should all of it happen then I think it's plausible. But it has to happen immediately, it has to happen now. It's now beyond getting together and having a summit. It's now calling up the various leaders and saying 'now, do it now, mobilize this thing instantly and proactively."" The medical organization Medicines San Frontieres -- or Doctors Without Borders -- had warned six months ago of the Ebola threat to the world and ""we should have put a stop to it then,"" he said. An effective response, however, depended on more than ""just the usual suspects"" of Western Europe and the United States getting involved, said Geldof. ""It should be in the interest to the Chinese and the Japanese and the Russians to contribute to this and we hear very little from them and we should hear more.""","An outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa has killed more than 4,400 people since March .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian football icon Pele has told CNN his record during a playing career spanning 25 years is unrivalled by anyone else in the sport. The former Santos striker was part of three World Cup winning Brazil squads and was named FIFA player of the century in 2000. The 70-year-old, whose full name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento, said modern players do not achieve success over a prolonged period like their illustrious predecessors. ""Nobody did what Pele did,"" the one-time New York Cosmos forward told CNN. ""Being champion of the world at 17-years-old, won three World Cups, scored more than 1,208 goals, only him. ""Then until now nobody did this, to me, Pele is the best. You can mention players that played for 10 years, for example [Franz] Beckenbauer, [Michel] Platini, [Eric] Cantona, Bobby Charlton, George Best, then come [Diego] Maradona, Zico. ""Those players used to play a long time. Now the players they play one year, two years, then disappear."" His final World Cup was in 1970 and Pele rates the Brazil team that lifted the Jules Rimet trophy in Mexico as the finest the South American country has ever produced. ""In 1958, 1962, Brazil had excellent individuals. We had Garrincha, we had Didi, Djalma Santos. Also Pele, [Mario] Zagallo were excellent players. But as a team all together I think 1970 was no doubt the best team."" Brazil will host the tournament they have won a record five times in 2014, and their former number 10 said the nation will be ready for one of sport's biggest competitions, but Pele warned the speed of preparations must be increased. ""Of course they [the stadiums] will be ready. The state of San Paulo ... we don't decide yet, we don't start [building] the stadium yet. This I think is a little bad for the reputation of Brazil, for the reputation of those who work for Brazil. That's my worry."" After 18 years with Santos, Pele made the decision to sign with the Cosmos in the now defunct North American Soccer League (NASL) in 1975. A project to bring back the Cosmos -- which includes former Manchester United striker Cantona as the team's director of football -- has been launched and Pele is acting as a representative for his former club. ""When I retired, at that time I had a lot of proposals to play in Europe, England, Italy, Spain, Mexico. But I said no, after 18 years I want to rest, because I want to retire. ""They wanted to make soccer big in the United States. That was the reason I come back to play. Then I start my mission. Now I am here because of this. ""We are going to revive New York Cosmos, to be fantastic.

"Washington (CNN) -- The political posturing, and theater, related to the fiscal cliff continued Thursday as Senate leaders squared off over whether to make it harder for Congress to block future increases in the debt ceiling. At issue was a move by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and meant to put Democrats in a tough spot, that backfired. McConnell pushed for a vote on an idea he first proposed last year as part of the debt ceiling standoff. Movement in fiscal cliff talks . The legislation would allow the president to increase the debt ceiling without congressional approval, though Congress could block the move if a two-thirds majority of both the House and Senate voted to disapprove it. Democrats want the change because raising the limit has become increasingly contentious, as Republicans have demanded spending cuts and other reforms to go along with it. Another debt limit increase is needed early next year. McConnell now opposes the change he once advanced because it was intended as a one-time solution to the deadlock over the debt last year. Nevertheless, he pushed for a vote on it because he wanted to show that even some Democrats oppose giving the president that much authority, and he knew there was no way Democrats could garner the 60 votes typically needed for major legislation to pass the Senate. But in the back-and-forth legislative chess match that often plays out on the Senate floor, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid instead moved to pass the measure with a 51-vote threshold, confident that he had at least that many votes to give Democrats a victory. Recognizing that, McConnell objected to voting at the lower threshold, meaning he was filibustering the bill he had just pushed for a vote. Obama visits 'middle class' family . As expected, Democrats did declare victory and argued that Republican defeat was another sign that they are losing the bigger battle over the fiscal cliff. ""Senator McConnell's filibuster prevented us from having this vote today, but I will continue to seek an agreement to hold an up-or-down vote on his proposal to avoid another debt ceiling debacle,"" Reid said.

"Washington (CNN) -- As the Senate cleared the way for consideration of gun control measures for the first time in nearly 20 years, the path ahead for any gun control measure in the Republican-led House of Representatives is rocky and uncertain. Senate overcomes filibuster, clearing the way for debate on gun bill . Family members of those killed in the tragic shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, spent three days shuffling from meeting to meeting with senators urging swift action. But across the Capitol, there is no sense of urgency as most rank and file House GOP members are taking a wait and see approach to moving any gun bill, while a bloc of Republicans members are solidly against considering new gun restrictions. Manchin to Sandy Hook parents: 'I can do something' House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio repeated his long held position that the House would review whatever emerged from the Senate. He was noncommittal about bringing gun legislation to the House floor for a vote. King, Thompson to introduce background checks in House . ""I fully expect that the House will act in some way, shape or form but to make a blanket commitment without knowing what the underlying bill is I think would be irresponsible on my part,"" Boehner told reporters on Thursday. Unlike senators, many of whom represent diverse states that include urban and suburban constituencies pressing for new gun restrictions, House districts are more narrowly drawn along partisan lines, and the current House is dominated by members in reliably Republican seats who feel less pressure to act. In many cases, these members are getting lobbied from constituents to hold the line against anything they think could curb access to guns. Sen. Rand Paul: The government wants your gun rights . ""You have a lot of members here who are still scared of the NRA,"" Democratic Rep Carolyn McCarthy of New York, a gun control advocate, said on Wednesday. Gun control advocates are hopeful the Senate deal struck by pro-gun Sens. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, a key conservative, on expanding background checks will help provide cover for Republicans in the House who might be worried about backlash for supporting it. While it appears Toomey's top billing is helping, so far most rank and file House Republicans say they want proof the Senate can actually pass something. Meanwhile, they continue to call for the Obama administration to enforce current gun laws, and emphasize there is bipartisan support to address mental health issues over measures dealing with access to guns. Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, who hails from Manchin's home state and is running for an open Senate seat there in 2014, said the Senate proposal ""has got problems. It's very unpopular in the state."" Capito said her office is already getting a lot of calls from voters in her district who oppose it, and estimated the current breakdown of the calls is roughly nine callers against gun control legislation for every one caller who says Congress needs to pass something. But Capito said she still wants to see the fine print of the Senate plan. A bipartisan duo in the House -- Rep. Peter King, R-New York, and Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson, D-California -- plan to introduce a House version of the background check bill early this week. King said there would likely be fewer than 10 House Republicans supporting it at first, but he said many GOP colleagues want to wait to see what happens in the Senate. King said it was too early to gauge the chances for the background check bill in the House, but stressed, ""the biggest swing factor will be if a number of 'Pat Toomey- like' Republicans support it in the Senate and it just creates a wave."" Thompson argued the national polls showing a public outcry for action mean Boehner and other House GOP leaders can't ignore the issue for long. CNN Poll: Popular background checks also cause worry . CNN Poll: Importance of guns soars, as do gun owner concerns . Gun rights activist: 'Your polls are hokum' ""I cannot imagine how the majority in the House could even think of not taking this bill up for a vote, especially after you've seen this breakthrough bipartisan support in the Senate. This isn't about the leadership of the majority party throttling Congress. This is about the American people wanting a vote, wanting background checks."" Why is this so hard? The disconnect on background checks and guns . Would background checks have stopped recent mass shootings? How do background checks work? Moderate GOP Rep. Charlie Dent, who represents one of a few swing districts in Pennsylvania, noted that the NRA backed a similar measure adopted by his home state in the 1990s requiring background checks for pistols. Toomey called Dent and other House Republicans earlier this week seeking their support before he unveiled his plan. Dent called the Senate compromise ""a proposal really worthy of serious consideration"" and while he hasn't fully endorsed it, he is on record pushing for enhanced background check legislation. NRA: Senate compromise 'will not prevent the next shooting' Asked if Toomey helps attract support from his GOP colleagues, Dent said, ""I suspect the answer to that question will largely depend on where you live. I suspect those who are from states like Pennsylvania, also the northeast, mid-Atlantic area might bring some measure of comfort to House members knowing that Sen. Toomey supports this."" Others agreed Toomey's top billing helps with House conservatives, but only to a degree. ""What it does do is it forces you to look at it seriously, as it should. I don't think on issues like this, however, it will impact how people will vote in one way or another,"" said Rep. Mario Diaz Balart, R-Florida. Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Patrick Meehan, a former federal prosecutor who represents a suburban area outside Philadelphia, said he's already on board with the Senate plan. He said the background check piece along with other provisions ""could be a promising package (in the House) and something that could be sold."" Thompson said Thursday he and King are in discussions with seven to eight additional House Republicans about signing on to that bill. In recent high-profile legislative debates, such as the fiscal cliff, Boehner has passed final measures with a majority of his own members opposing them. But Texas Republican Rep. Steve Stockman, an ardent gun rights advocate, is circulating a letter to Boehner warning him not to allow a vote on any gun bill unless a majority of House Republicans are on board. The letter, signed by 46 House Republicans so far, argues the background check measure violates the Second Amendment and wouldn't be an effective crime-fighting tool. It concludes ""under the precedents and traditions of the House, we would ask that no gun legislation be brought to the floor of the House unless it has the support of a majority of our caucus."" Asked if he'll adhere to the test of only allowing a vote on a bill if it has the support of the majority of his own members, Boehner left some room on Thursday: ""Certainly my prerogative or my intention is to always pass bills with strong Republican support."" Senior House GOP aides caution that while the Senate may pass a bill soon, that doesn't necessarily mean the House will take up the proposal. They note that the process in the Senate took several months. House Republicans do expect President Barack Obama to ramp up political pressure and keep the issue out front to try to force action, but one of these senior House Republican sources suggested the White House refrain from any attempt to squeeze members. ""If the president really wants to get something done it is not the best strategy to try and jam the House. That hasn't proven to be effective in the past,"" this aide told CNN. In gun debate, Biden cites paranoia, Ferraris . But McCarthy insisted this time around the pro-gun control effort is just getting started and is more organized to turn the pressure on House members after the Senate acts. Pointing to public opinion polls showing overwhelming support among women for gun legislation, McCarthy pledged, ""We're showing our power and that power is not going to go away. I think it's going to be more difficult for them when they go home and haven't voted for something to save lives."" Michelle Obama makes emotional entrance into gun debate . Opinion: A mother's journey to bearing arms . Capito said the shooting in Newtown that left 20 children and six educators dead was a ""wake-up call"" and believes the House will ultimately vote on some package. But she stressed because the issue was politically sensitive it should go through ""regular order,"" meaning committees will hold hearings and spend time going through proposals. That means it will be many weeks, and likely months, before the House moves anything.","There is no sense of urgency in the House about moving a gun control bill .

"Islambad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari will pardon a Christian woman sentenced to death for blasphemy, the governor of Punjab state told CNN Tuesday. ""What basically he's made it clear is that she's not going to be a victim of this law,"" Gov. Salman Taseer told CNN International's ""Connect the World"" program. ""I mean, he's a liberal, modern-minded president and he's not going to see a poor woman like this targeted and executed. ... It's just not going to happen,"" Taseer said. Asia Bibi, who has been jailed for nearly 15 months, was convicted in a Pakistani court earlier this month of breaking the country's controversial blasphemy law by insulting Islam's Prophet Mohammed, a crime punishable with death or life imprisonment, according to Pakistan's penal code. She was sentenced to death. She has filed a petition for mercy with the High Court, Taseer said. ""If the High Court suspends the sentence and gives her bail then that is fine. We'll see that, and if that doesn't happen, then the president will pardon her,"" he said. A preliminary investigation showed Bibi was falsely accused, a government official said Monday. ""The president asked me to investigate her case and my preliminary findings show she is innocent and the charges against her are baseless,"" Pakistani Minister for Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti told CNN. Bhatti emphasized Monday that he has reached only preliminary conclusions and will submit a final report Wednesday to Zardari's office. Prosecutors say Bibi, a 45-year-old field worker, insulted the Prophet Mohammed after she got into a heated argument with Muslim co-workers who refused to drink from a bucket of water she had touched. In a brief news conference at the prison where she's being held, Bibi said Saturday that the allegations against her are lies fabricated by a group of women who don't like her. ""We had some differences and this was their way of taking revenge,"" she said. Bibi's death sentence sparked outrage among human rights groups, who condemned Pakistan's blasphemy law as a source of violence and persecution against religious minorities.

"(CNN) -- Five more Georgia men were charged in connection with an anti-government militia with ties to Fort Stewart that's been accused of killing two people and plotting to assassinate President Barack Obama, authorities said Tuesday. The five defendants were indicted in Liberty County, Georgia, on charges that include violation of the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act, involving what prosecutors called an ""identified criminal street gang"" named FEAR, for Forever Enduring, Always Ready. Four U.S. Army soldiers at Fort Stewart had already been accused of being members of the anarchist group, which was allegedly stockpiling weapons and bomb parts to overthrow the U.S. government, prosecutors said. The four soldiers are accused of killing former GI Michael Roark and his teenage girlfriend, Tiffany York. 'Anarchists' accused of murder; broader plot against government . Under one of three indictments returned Monday by a Liberty County grand jury, Christopher Jenderseck was charged with three Street Gang Act violations and two counts of tampering with evidence in the killings of Roark and York in neighboring Long County, said District Attorney Tom Durden and Assistant District Attorney Isabel Pauley of the Atlantic Judicial Circuit. In a second indictment, defendant Timothy Martin Joiner is charged with burglary, theft by taking and two Street Gang Act violations. Adam Dearman is charged with three Street Gang Act offenses. In the third indictment, Joiner, Adam Dearman, Randall Blake Dearman and Anthony Garner are charged jointly, prosecutors said. Joiner and Randall Dearman each face two counts of burglary, nine counts of entering an auto, two counts of financial transaction card theft, one count of theft by taking, one count of criminal damage to property in the second degree, and 14 counts of Street Gang Act violations, prosecutors said. In addition, Adam Dearman is indicted on three counts of Street Gang Act violations, and Garner is charged with theft by receiving stolen property and one Street Gang Act count, prosecutors said. Jenderseck was arrested Tuesday in North Dakota, but Joiner and Garner weren't in custody, authorities said Tuesday. Regarding the charges against the four soldiers, a law enforcement official said they had legally purchased at least 18 rifles and handguns in Washington and Georgia. Uncompleted pipe bombs were also found, and were comprised of store-bought materials, the official said. No sophisticated military grade-explosives were involved in their construction. One official described the offenses as a murder case and said no federal charges had been filed. Last month, Pfc. Michael Burnett laid out the elaborate plot, telling a southeast Georgia court that he was part of what prosecutors called ""an anarchist group and militia."" Dressed in his Army uniform, he spoke in a Long County court about the group of Army soldiers and its role in the December deaths of Roark and York. Roark, he said, was killed because he took money from the group and planned to leave. ""I don't know how it got to the point where two people got murdered,"" Burnett said in court. He talked about how he and three others accused -- Pvt. Isaac Aguigui, Sgt. Anthony Peden and Pvt. Christopher Salmon -- had begun getting together, ""just going out shooting guns, just guy stuff."" ""And then Aguigui introduced me to 'the manuscript,' that's what he called it, a book about true patriots,"" the soldier said. The four men became part of a group that aimed ""to give the government back to the people,"" according to Burnett, who said that revolution was its goal. They called it FEAR -- Forever Enduring Always Ready -- and spent thousands of dollars buying guns and bomb parts. Prosecutors: 'Anarchist' group of U.S. soldiers aimed to overthrow government . The government needed a change, Burnett told the court. ""I thought we were the people who would be able to change it."" It is not clear how capable the group was of carrying out the goals Burnett laid out. Assistant District Attorney Pauley identified Aguigui as the leader of what she described as ""an anarchist group and militia"" that included active and former troops. ""Defendant Aguigui actively recruited new members at Fort Stewart (in southeast Georgia) and targeted soldiers who were in trouble or disillusioned,"" she said. At the time of their arrest, group members had plotted a number of ""acts of domestic terror,"" the prosecutor said. These included ""forcibly taking over the ammo control point of Fort Stewart to take the post, bombing vehicles of local and state judicial and political figureheads and federal representatives to include the local department of homeland security, (and plotting) to bomb the fountain at Forsyth Park in Savannah."" Days before he died, Roark had been discharged from the Army, according to Pauley. Roark and his girlfriend were killed because Aguigui felt the couple was ""a loose end,"" Burnett said. Burnett admitted being at the scene of the crime, including watching as a soldier ""checked (York's) pulse and then shot her again."" As part of an agreement with prosecutors, Burnett pleaded guilty to manslaughter -- instead of murder, thus avoiding a possible death sentence -- and other charges. He also agreed to testify against the three other soldiers accused in the case. All four soldiers had also been charged by the military in connection with the two killings. But as their case proceeded through civilian courts, the Army dismissed its charges, according to Fort Stewart spokesman Kevin Larson. In a statement last month, Larson insisted that Fort Stewart and its affiliated Hunter Army Airfield do not have ""a gang or militia problem."" ""Any suspicions of gang activity are actively investigated by CID, (which) recognizes the obvious concerns with the combination of gangs and military-type training,"" he said. ""That is why CID monitors and investigates gang and extremist group association with criminal acts in the Army so closely. We believe the reason we are able to maintain a low gang criminal threat status is because of the awareness of and focus on the threat."" Fort Stewart, about 40 miles southwest of Savannah, is home to the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division. Tens of thousands of troops, their dependents, civilian personnel and contractors live and work on the base, which encompasses 280,000 acres and includes parts of five counties, including Long County, which has about 14,500 residents. Hunter Army Airfield is in Savannah but is officially part of the larger Fort Stewart complex. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks what it characterizes as ""hate groups"" nationwide, spoke to Aguigui's father last month. ""I served my country for 20 years and I honor that, take pride in that,"" Ed Aguigui told the center, according to the center's Hatewatch blog. ""I don't know what my son's views are, and where they came from.""","A Georgia grand jury indicts five men in an alleged militia plot that includes soldiers .

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal authorities filed 17 new charges against Ahmed Abu Khatallah, alleging that he was the ringleader of twin 2012 attacks on U.S. diplomatic and CIA compounds in Benghazi that killed four Americans. A new indictment against Khatallah, 43, provides new details of the attack and what federal prosecutors say was his role in leading 20 armed men in the attacks carried out over more than seven hours. Previously, prosecutors charged him with a single count of providing material support to terrorists. According to the indictment, Khatallah conspired with others ""on or before Sept. 11, 2012"" to attack the U.S. diplomatic post. ""He believed the facility was being used to collect intelligence, that he viewed the U.S. intelligence actions in Benghazi as illegal,"" the document said. ""These additional charges reflect Ahmed Abu Khattalah's integral role in the attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, which led to the deaths of four brave Americans,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder. The indictment doesn't say how much planning was involved, and doesn't account for the possibility that the attack coincided with other attacks elsewhere in the Muslim world that targeted U.S. diplomatic facilities. Republican critics have said the Obama administration failed to take sufficient measures to prevent the attacks. They also criticize officials for initially portraying the terrorist rampage as spinning out from street protests blamed on an anti-Islam movie produced in the United States. Khatallah has pleaded not guilty to one count of providing material support to terrorists and will remain jailed until his trial, a federal magistrate ruled in July. He will be arraigned on the new charges on October 20. Ten of those charges, including murder, could carry the death penalty. Authorities contend that Khatallah is a senior leader of Ansar al Sharia, whose members were among several militias that participated in the two-pronged armed assault. Khatallah remained free for more than a year after the attacks, doing interviews with CNN and other media, prompting criticism of the Obama administration over how long it was taking to arrest the alleged attackers. He was arrested in a military raid in Libya in June and charged in federal court in Washington, D.C., mere yards away from Capitol buildings where he has become the center of political controversy. Assistant Attorney General for national security John Carlin said in a statement Tuesday that the case ""highlights our resolve to find and hold terrorists accountable wherever they may hide."" Prosecutors say the attack in Benghazi began around 9:45 p.m. with Khatallah and about 20 armed men attacking the main gate of the diplomatic mission. They set fire to buildings and Khatallah and others allegedly turned away emergency responders. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and Sean Patrick Smith, a mission employee, perished from wounds suffered in that attack. The attackers retreated briefly around 10:15 p.m., according to the indictment, and then an hour later launched another attack on the mission's southern gate. They used assault rifles, rocket propelled grenades and other explosives. The attackers plundered what they could from the compound, then shortly after midnight, the indictment says Khatallah and others retreated to a camp operated by Ansar al Sharia. Khatallah then led the attacks on the CIA annex beginning at 12:30 a.m. and again at 5:15 a.m., according to the indictment. Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, security officers at the CIA annex, were killed. At a July hearing, defense lawyers contended the Justice Department hasn't provided evidence to support the case.","Grand jury hands down 17 more charges against suspected militant .

"(CNN) -- A Michigan militia leader and his son pleaded guilty Thursday to federal gun charges two days after a federal judge in Detroit dropped the more serious charges of sedition and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction against the government. David Stone, Sr., 47, and his son Joshua Stone, 23, members of the Hutaree Militia, face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 after admitting to possessing illegal automatic firearms. Both have already spent two years in prison. ""We are gratified that these felony convictions mean that these defendants will never be permitted to possess firearms again,"" said U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade. Federal authorities accused nine members of the ""Christian warrior"" militia of homegrown terrorism. The FBI planted a secret informant and FBI agent in the militia in 2008 to record the activities of the group. The video and audio recordings became the crux of the federal case, including clips of the elder Stone making anti-government statements and remarks about killing police officers. But in a trial that began in early February, federal District Judge Victoria Roberts said she did not find that the government's evidence sufficiently proved that the Hutaree militia had planned a conspiracy against the government. ""The court's order dismissing the more serious charges in this case was disappointing, but it does not shake our commitment to dismantling groups who would harm our citizens and law enforcement officers, and these efforts will continue,"" McQuade said. The move cleared several of the original nine defendants of all charges. The Stones ""admitted that they possessed machine guns, specifically a Bushmaster .223 caliber rifle and a Double Star Corp. .223 caliber rifle respectively, knowing that the firearms would shoot, and were designed to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger,"" the U.S. attorney's office said. Roberts, in her 28-page ruling dismissing the more serious charges, said the ""government's case is built largely of circumstantial evidence."" ""While this evidence could certainly lead a rational fact finder to conclude that 'something fishy' was going on, it does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants reached a concrete agreement to forcibly oppose the United States government,"" Roberts said. ""Pick a sentence here, pick a sentence there -- the (remarks were) taken out of context,"" a defense attorney for one of the cleared militia members said. ""We always said it was a First Amendment and Second Amendment case, and that's what it ended up being,"" added attorney Michael Rataj, whose client, Tina Stone, is the wife of the elder Stone. The Hutaree militia members cleared of all charges are Tina Stone, 46; David Stone, Jr., 22, another son of the elder Stone; Thomas Piatek, 48; Michael Meeks, 40; and Kristopher Sickles, 29. Defendant Joshua Clough, 30, awaits his sentence after pleading guilty to a weapons charge in December. Another defendant, Jacob Ward, 35, will be tried separately. ""I didn't figure we were doing anything wrong -- in the lines of going out there and doing the trainings -- to me it was basically fun,"" Tina Stone said Wednesday. ""I'm worried for my husband and son. I guess I will be able to live my life a little easier once they're home.""","David Stone, Sr., and his son Joshua Stone face up to 10 years in prison for gun charges .

"West Hollywood, California (CNN) -- The painting is called ""Coma."" It depicts an unconscious patient being slowly pulled into the mouth of a macabre death mask. Helpless. The death's head resembles the opening of a CAT scan machine, a symbol of modern medical technology. It is the work of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the man who bore the notorious nickname ""Dr. Death."" He was a passionate advocate for allowing certain people to choose the time and manner of their own death. He claimed to have assisted in the suicides for more than 130 patients over a period of nearly 20 years. Kevorkian's career ended in 1999 with his conviction on charges of second degree murder for administering a lethal injection to a patient who had Lou Gehrig's disease. He spent eight years in prison. Most people though don't realize that Kevorkian was also a longtime painter. Eleven of his works of art are on display this month in a trendy West Hollywood art gallery. ""He was a talented amateur,"" curator Lee Bowers told CNN. ""He painted throughout much of his life."" All 11 paintings are available for purchase. The asking price is as much as $45,000 per canvas, Bowers said. Proceeds go to the estate and the gallery, and the paintings that don't sell are headed to the Smithsonian, Bowers said. The exhibition also includes the assisted suicide machine that Kevorkian designed and built, the ""Thanatron."" The contraption helped inject a series of drugs into terminal and incapacitated patients who wished to end their lives. It too is for sale to the highest bidder, at a starting price of $25,000. Despite the attention surrounding the macabre suicide machine, the paintings comprise the heart of the show. ""Paralysis"" is typical of the series of paintings that depict some aspect of disease and human suffering. The painting presents an image of a naked man crouched in a claustrophobic prison. Half his body has been turned to stone. His limbs are crumbling and useless. His brain has been removed and shackled, his body unable to respond to its commands. Other paintings comment satirically on what Kevorkian viewed as the hypocrisy of the medical code of ethics. He once called efforts to prosecute him ""a political lynching, engineered by the Inquisition."" Portraits of Kevorkian's parents and one of German composer Johann Sebastian Bach reflect an homage to those who influenced his life. Efforts to sell the paintings following Kevorkian's death in 2011 were hampered by a legal dispute over their ownership. For many years, they were housed in the Armenian Library and Museum of America in Watertown, Massachusetts, near Boston. After his death, the Kevorkian estate claimed the art work was only on loan to the museum. The dispute was resolved with the museum retaining four of his works. Kevorkian's niece is now offering the paintings in her possession for sale at Gallerie Sparta. Kevorkian told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta in 2010 that serving eight years in prison had not changed his view of assisted suicide. ""It's a medical service,"" Kevorkian stated, ""It's not political. It's not religious."" Are his paintings great art? Well, that is in the eye of the beholder. But they continue to speak to Dr. Kevorkian's battle against the medical and legal establishment. A battle that continues, even in death.","Dr. Jack Kevorkian's art is on display and for sale this month .

"(CNN) -- The weekend killings at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin have brought a furious fringe genre of American music out of the background and to the front of the mix. So called hate-rock bands like the one once led by temple gunman Wade Page are increasingly important to the U.S. white supremacist movement, drawing in new recruits and bringing in cash, according to groups that keep tabs on those groups. Page was shot to death by police on Sunday after killing six people at the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, a Milwaukee suburb, investigators say. He led a North Carolina-based band called End Apathy for the past several years and played with several groups ""in the leading tier"" of the genre over the past decade, said Devin Burghart, author of ""Soundtracks to the White Revolution,"" a book on the subculture. Opinion: An American tradition of bigotry . Bands like Page's are instrumental to bringing disaffected teens into the movement, he said. ""They're isolated individuals, often with behavioral problems, perhaps problems at home who are looking for a new familial bond as well as a sense of identity and belonging,"" said Burghart, the head of research for the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights in Spokane, Washington. ""So white-power music comes in,"" he said. ""It bridges the gap between healthy youth rebellion and hardcore white supremacy, providing that kind of Aryan identity."" Once drawn in, hate groups ""get these younger kids to do their bidding,"" said David Gletty, who once infiltrated the movement for the FBI. ""They brainwash them into believing that hate is the way to go and following them is the only way to go, and that there are other races of people that are against the white people,"" Gletty told CNN. Meanwhile, the music has become a multimillion-dollar business for a handful of labels, Burghart said. Some of those may press as many as 25,000 copies of a well-known band, a respectable figure for an independent imprint, but most produce far smaller numbers of CDs or records. ""It really provides the bulk of the financing, such as it is, that neo-Nazi and related kinds of groups are able to earn in this country,"" added Mark Potok, who tracks white supremacist groups for the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center. The movement has followers in both Europe and North America. But in the United States, the First Amendment offers the bands and their labels a protection that they don't have across the Atlantic. Many European countries have restricted neo-Nazi activities, symbols and statements since the horrors of World War II, so the recordings are traded largely on a black market there, Burghart said. White supremacist groups hold occasional music festivals that typically draw about 200 fans, usually held on rural private land because of the difficulty of booking public venues, Burghart said. They're raucous, often violent affairs in which some of the fissures among different groups flare into ""fisticuffs and scuffles,"" he said. And Gletty told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that the crowds ""have the mindset of a pit bull."" Opinion: Sikhism respects all, even those who hate . ""In one moment they're like a mother pit bull licking their little puppies, and then, 10 seconds later, they're just off the wall doing something crazy,"" he said. ""Their mind snaps, but they love this ... the ones that commit this violence, they thrive on this, and most of them really feel that it's the government pushing them towards this."" But while the stereotype of the skinhead is a brawling, blue-collar kid, ""today it's far more of a middle class or even upper class phenomenon,"" Burghart said. He cites the example of Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, a young neo-Nazi who targeted blacks, Jews and Asians in a weekend of drive-by shootings in Illinois and Indiana in 1999. Police say Smith killed two people and wounded another 10 before fatally crashing a stolen minivan during a police chase. ""Ben Smith was recruited through the white power music scene,"" Burghart said. ""He was from an upper, upper middle class family from the wealthy Chicago suburbs. He went to the most prestigious high school in Illinois. He came from a stable family and yet was attracted to the movement ... He's more of the model of the folks today than in the past."" That has changed the movement around them as well, as members set up businesses ranging from tattoo parlors to cable-installation contractors to support their activities. ""It increases the desire for a kind of professionalization in the scene,"" he said. ""So instead of doing this simply as a passion, as true believers, they saw a business model that they could bring to the scene."" Remembering the victims .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When China's most successful homegrown movie went on international release last month, hopes were high that the slapstick comedy, which has drawn comparisons with ""The Hangover,"" would blaze a trail for Chinese-language cinema. But ""Lost in Thailand,"" which picked up the highest grossing film at Hong Kong's Asian Film Awards on Monday night, flopped outside mainland China -- only collecting $57,000 in the United States and $72,000 in Hong Kong, according to figures from consultancies Film Business Asia and Beijing-based Entgroup. The film earned $202 million in China, making the unexpected hit the most profitable movie ever after Hollywood extravaganza ""Avatar."" ""We heard that it is not doing well overseas, or could be considered a failure, due to the cultural differences,"" Entgroup's Aiden Sun told CNN. China's movie market is the world's second largest, in terms of box office takings, but its films are a hard sell for international audiences. Poor marketing, a lack of recognizable stars and plot lines and humor that get muddled in translation weigh against Chinese films and it's a trend that's not improving despite the country's thriving movie industry. While Chinese-language films have never been mainstream viewing for English-speaking audiences, a decade ago titles such as ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,"" ""Hero"" and ""In the Mood for Love"" captured the imagination of movie buffs worldwide. Today, according to industry players at Hong Kong's Filmart trade fair this week that accompanies the Asian Film Awards, it is getting harder to sell Chinese films, even in markets with a shared language and culture such as Singapore. ""The enthusiasm created by ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is no longer there. We are starting more or less from scratch -- whether and how we can rebuild the international market for Chinese language films,"" said Jeffrey Chan, who is charge of international sales for Chinese studio Bona Film Group. Part of the reason is stronger local-language film production in places like Singapore, Thailand and South Korea, said Lim Teck, a Singaporean film producer and distributor. Teck said that he made more money from the five locally made movies he released in the city state last year than from the 16 Chinese-language titles he distributed. Doris Pfardrescher, president of Well Go USA, the main distributor of Asian films in North America, says that Chinese martial arts movies and action flicks, with their simple stories and visual effects, play well with U.S. audiences but these films are no longer being made in such great numbers as Chinese moviegoers seek out lighter fare. ""Films that are doing really, really well in China are your romantic comedies and your fantasies that are really difficult to translate over to the U.S.,"" she said. ""There is a lot of political humor and cultural differences that Americans don't understand."" Arbitrary censorship rules make Chinese films harder to market. Some genres, like horror, that are popular internationally are frowned upon in China and officials have the final say on release dates making the advance marketing materials and trailers necessary for an international theatrical release harder to handle. China also lacks a new generation of globally bankable stars to replace the likes of Chow Yun-Fat, Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh, who made their name in Hong Kong action movies of the 1980s and 1990s before moving onto Hollywood. By contrast, today's young actors are making so much money in China that they have little incentive to head west. ""You're an A plus plus star in China but outside you are nobody. Psychologically, you have to overcome these hurdles,"" said Jeffrey Chan. Of course, given the size and profitability of China's market, in some respects, it matters little that its movies don't perform well overseas or that its stars aren't household names. India has a thriving movie industry but Bollywood hits only find a niche market outside the country. However, Beijing is becoming more assertive in its attempts to project its own view of the world and looks at the global reach and appeal of U.S. films and television shows with envy. Many people believe China would like to see its movie industry become a force to be reckoned with on the silver screen. ""I think they want (their film business) to expand internationally,"" added Chan. ""But despite that intention, we're in a business where the product matters a lot more than in a lot of other industries. We're not mass producing something that is easy to replicate.""","Chinese-language movies a hard sell to international audiences .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- South African mining company Gold One has fired more than 1,400 miners who have been on strike for more than a week, the company announced Tuesday. The workers at the Ezulwini mine outside Johannesburg were dismissed after what the company called ""appropriate disciplinary procedures"" and a court's declaration that the strike was illegal. Those fired make up about three-quarters of the 1,900 miners at the facility and will have a chance to appeal their dismissals, Gold One reported. It's the latest twist in a wave of sometimes-violent labor unrest that has wracked South Africa's mining sector -- the country's biggest industry -- for nearly two months. Another company, Anglo-American Platinum, fired about 12,000 striking workers who declined to attend disciplinary hearings last week after a three-week walkout. Four people were wounded during clashes between security officers and striking workers at another Gold One mine in September. And police opened fire on strikers Lonmin's Marikana platinum mine in August, killing killing 34 workers and wounding dozens more. The strike at the Ezulwini facility started October 1. Police have a ""strong presence"" there to prevent violence, Gold One said in a written statement Tuesday. South African company fires 12,000 striking miners .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Women have been some of Sheryl Sandberg's harshest critics, but the thousands who gathered over the weekend in Chicago at BlogHer, the largest conference in the world for women bloggers, fully embraced the ""Lean In"" author, crowding around her for a handshake and a personal photo and giving her a standing ovation after her keynote appearance. Sandberg's repeated message to the women here was that ""Lean In,"" her best-seller that has now sold 1 million copies, wasn't just about encouraging women to become a CEO or run for office. "" 'Lean In' is about believing in ourselves and reaching for any ambition,"" the Facebook chief operating officer and mom of two said, adding the book was directed at all women, from the work-at-home mom fighting for a better teacher for her children to a woman reaching for the C-suite. ""It's about each one of us asking ourselves what we would do if we weren't afraid and then reaching for those ambitions."" In light of criticism her message is elitist or critical of women who don't have sky-high aspirations, Sandberg seemed to take pains to clarify what leaning in means for women such as the many work-from-home mom bloggers at this conference. Were these remarks a shift in her message, I wondered as I listened, a recalibration after her book set off a national debate about what it means to ""Lean In"" or a message that Sandberg had always wanted to send from the start? ""It's not a recalibration, but if the message got lost, I have to take some responsibility,"" Sandberg told me with a chuckle during a press conference. She said that while she considered writing a more detailed book, which she seemed to indicate would have included the stories of women from all walks of life, to make it ""really authentic,"" she focused mainly on her experiences and those of the people around her, who happen to be corporate women. ""The intention was for the message to be really inclusive so that message is important to me,"" she said. Judging by the response from women I chatted with after Sandberg spoke, her message came through loud and clear this time. ""I had always taken 'Lean In' as go all the way to the top,"" said Danielle Herzog, a mom of two who blogs at Martinis and Minivans. ""Well, what if I don't want to go all the way to the top right now?"" But after hearing Sandberg speak, Herzog concluded that leaning in means simply ""following your dreams,"" whether they lead you to the boardroom or not. ""What I took away from this is you should be the best at whatever you want to be,"" said Norine Dworkin-McDaniel, co-creator of an illustrated humor blog about parenting, ""I don't want to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. I would hate that, but I can be the best CEO or chief of scientific snarkiness of Science of Parenthood."" Another point that resonated with the women here was Sandberg's concern about how we're raising our daughters, leading to what she calls a ""leadership ambition gap"" -- how by middle school, in survey after survey, more boys say they want to lead someday versus girls. ""And no wonder because little girls figure out really easily that the boys are going to lead and be liked and they are going to be told, 'Do not be bossy,' "" she said. Leigh Baker, who writes about the comical side to parenting, didn't realize until she listened to Sandberg how differently she's raising her son and daughter. ""I am guilty of saying that she's bossy,"" she said. ""I encourage her to be a leader on the field, but I don't encourage her to be a leader off the field, but I do the exact opposite with my son."" Sandberg's celebrity status following the release of her book has led to speculation she might be looking for her next act beyond Facebook, maybe even considering a run for public office. ""No, I'm doing about all the leaning I can do right now,"" she told BlogHer co-founder Lisa Stone with a laugh. Facebook, she made clear, remains her focus, but she'll also spend as much time as she can on her ""Lean In"" online community, which now has more than 250,000 members, making it one of the fastest-growing communities on Facebook and the most engaged, according to Rachel Thomas, president of Sandberg's nonprofit, LeanIn.org. To demonstrate the power of that community, after her keynote, Sandberg joined dozens of women at BlogHer as they broke into small groups to conduct ""Lean In"" circles designed to allow women to open up to their peers about questions such as what's holding them back. ""There were tables that cried, they cheered, they clapped, and at the end, they talked about ... how they felt, and it was amazing. 'We can do anything,' 'I feel empowered.' That is why circles are growing so rapidly,"" said Thomas, noting how there are more than 7,000 registered circles in all 50 states and at least 50 countries. During Sandberg's time at BlogHer, I was struck by the disconnect between the criticism she's received nationally -- especially from some women -- and the response she received here from women, many of whom are not working in corporate America. ""I thought she was really humble and approachable, and I wasn't really expecting that,"" said Kelly Glover, host of the blog Big Curvy Love, who had a chance to meet Sandberg. Deb Gaisford, a mom of an 18-month-old who blogs at Urban Moo Cow, said she thinks much of the criticism stems from women trying to defend their choices. ""I think it's because people are looking at their own situations and clinging to their own sort of insecurities and not really being open to her message."" Jessica Ziegler, co-founder of the blog Science of Parenthood, said she doesn't find any of the criticism surprising. ""People love to stir it up. It's so much easier to have a big fat negative opinion than to get behind a movement that is trying to support a huge group of people.""

"(CNN) -- A recent article in The New York Times noted that the nation's divorce rate -- which plateaued for years at around 50% -- has significantly dropped -- to just above 40%. As almost an aside, the writer mentioned that only one group, the 50-plusers, have seen their rate of divorce surge 50% in the past 20 years. Oops -- to this boomer, that is ""burying the lead."" Why would only the boomers have a significant growth in marital dissolution -- one in four divorces after age 50 -- while other ages do not? After all, it's counterintuitive: Traditionally marriages are most vulnerable to divorce in the first seven to 10 years. Should we see this as a harbinger of doom for 30-year-olds getting married today? We might surmise from these data that the only reason the 20- and 30-somethings' divorce rate is lower is that they just haven't lived as long. And, to be sure, some demographers do believe that eventually we can expect the marriages of Generation Xers and millennials to meet the same fate as all of those divorcing boomers. However, I would like to float this idea: It won't necessarily happen that way. Boomers' unique social history may make them more divorce-prone than other groups. Why? Baby boomers, those 79 million born roughly between 1945 and 1964, are a specific cohort because of the conditions and events that they both experienced and, sometimes, created. Boomers came of age as relatively pampered children of a great postwar economy. With their adolescent disrespect for the past and their theme of ""sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll,"" they pushed against the restrictive conventions of social life their parents more or less had accepted. They cut a swath through history partly because of their bulk -- 26% of the U.S. population -- and partly because of their critical approach to the status quo. As young adults, large numbers of them were part of the civil rights, anti-war, gay rights and women's movements. Books and magazine articles in their time attacked (and counterattacked) traditional gender roles -- and the institution of marriage and its traditions. Boomer women experienced more recreational sex and more sex partners than women in previous generations. New job opportunities and careers helped create the changes in household formation (such as who was or wasn't home during the day, who did less or more housework, and who wanted more or less sex) that disrupted traditional marriage. As a result, the boomers experienced decades of relationship innovation, creating cultural confusion about whether marriage was necessary, and what made an excellent -- or even adequate -- marriage. As boomer men and women wavered between choosing self-fulfillment over older traditions of duty, loyalty and lifetime marriage at any cost, the institution of marriage became, over time, more of a voluntary association than a predictably permanent one. Sociologist and demographer Andrew Cherlin has written that between the 1960s and '70s the divorce rate skyrocketed, correlating exactly with the first divorces at the leading edge of the boomer generation. And while the rate leveled out in the 1980s, a large number of people had already defected toward new opportunities for emotional and sexual self-fulfillment. In many ways, divorce rates are the boomers' legacy. But why does this group continue to make marital changes even in middle and late middle age? Because they are still making it up as they go along, inventing middle age pretty much the same way they made up adolescence and marriage, redefining the parameters of personal relationships and reinventing what different stages of the life cycle could look like. They are fighting fiercely to remain youthful, to stay employed and/or passionately engaged with life, sexually vibrant (particularly with the help of new medical interventions) and regard their 50s and 60s as every bit the opportunity for love and sexual attraction that their 20s and 30s were. At age 55 or 65, they look at spending 20 or 30 more years with the same person -- and unlike their parents, whose sense of duty was stronger and opportunities to repair weaker, they are ready to walk if things aren't up to their hopes, dreams or delusions about marriage. So why don't I think this same cycle will happen for our 30-somethings? • They are more sober about marriage than boomers were at the same ages. They've seen what high divorce rates felt like when their parents split up -- and many of them desperately want to avoid that kind of emotional carnage for their children or for themselves. Indeed a Pew Research study on social and demographic trends found that ""when it comes to divorce, the baby boomers are less conservative than younger generations: 66% say divorce is preferable to staying in an unhappy marriage, compared with 54% of younger adults who say so."" • They are getting married later: The average age for college-educated men and women is in their late 20s. They are more mature, already gaining or losing traction in their chosen work or career, and potential partners can better gauge them as a marriage prospect. Finally, they have been out of school longer, most of them have lived with someone one or more times, and they know more about the world and relationships. • They have experienced a treacherous economy. Their parents grew up in a lush financial period, but they did not. Young couples are more like their grandparents or great grandparents: aware of the need to pull together for economic security. While not all boomers prospered during the hot economy that attended most of their adult years, they didn't start out being careful about the economic consequences of divorce in the way that their children -- and their own parents -- had to do. Of course there is no telling if the divorce rate will continue to decline into the future. Sadly, I would not predict that it will. We expect too much from marriage; we have much too high expectations for what a partner should be throughout a long life cycle -- and we live a long time. It's hard to keep a marriage strong, passionate and relevant over so many decades. But there is that 40% divorce rate. Maybe not exactly something to crow about, but better odds of having a marriage worth staying in is all to the good for the couple, our society and certainly the next generation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pepper Schwartz.","Pepper Schwartz: Baby boomers' divorce rate doubled while U.S. divorce rate is down .

"(CNN) -- It's a rapidly spreading pop culture phenomenon, fueled by the Internet. Korean pop music or K-pop, is one of the most notable exports to come out of South Korea in the past decade. Korea's content watchdogs say K-pop exports grew nearly 50 percent from 2011 to 2012, grossing an estimated $290 million last year. Earlier this year, nine-member K-Pop dance group Girls' Generation beat Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga for ""Video of the Year"" at the 2013 YouTube Music Awards in early November. The girl group is making waves as part of South Korea's young generation of pop stars rising up through the international ranks. K-pop concerts sell out in minutes. They raise television ratings, and their branding can get teens, and even some adults to buy just about anything. But it is not without incredible amounts of training. Most idols train for years in singing, dancing, acting and learning Asian languages before they are even allowed to debut their first song. Mike Suh, head of strategy and global business at entertainment conglomerate CJ E&M, says idols go through a long training period ""so that they immediately attract fans when they first appear."" That phenomenon was on display at the 2013 Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA for short) in Hong Kong, organized by CJ E&M, where some of South Korea's biggest idol groups Girls' Generation, BIGBANG, EXO, 2NE1 and Sistar held court. Tickets for the 10,000 seats were sold out within an hour of going on sale and nearly 13 million people signed onto MAMA's website to vote for their favorite idols. MAMA also showcased notable guests from the international music scene including Hong Kong singer/actor Aaron Kwok, Norway's Ylvis, Sweden's Icona Pop and American legend Stevie Wonder. Self-proclaimed K-Pop fan Paris Hilton also made an appearance. New pop . One of the more unique acts to go onstage was helmet-donning girl group Crayon Pop, which took home ""Best New Female Artist"" at the event. The comic act shot to fame when their music video ""Bar Bar Bar"" went viral earlier this year. At a backstage interview at MAMA, the five girls bowed politely, but were extremely careful of their actions. Showing how closely monitored they are, their manager was on high alert, often signaling to them about what they should and should not say. The practice is common among many idol groups, as any slip of the tongue can immediately damage their careers. In 2012, seven-member idol group Block B made comments in an interview about the tragic flooding in Thailand that some fans viewed as disrespectful and offensive. After a public outcry, the group issued many apologies but it wasn't enough. There were reports of music stations restricting them from appearing on its programs. Many netizens reportedly demanded their disbandment; some going as far as calling for the members to commit suicide. Former 2PM leader Jay Park also sparked public outrage after netizens found old posts on his social media site about his dislike for South Korea. The Korean-American was soon dropped from the idol group. Surveillance . Every action of an idol is monitored by their agency -- even romance can be prohibited by a clause in their contract. Singer Choi Dong-wook, known by his stage name Se7en, told a Korean talk show he saw his fan club instantly drop by about 100,000 members when he announced he had a girlfriend. Scandals can also have financial consequences. After BIGBANG leader G-Dragon tested positive for marijuana use in 2011, the group's management company YG Entertainment reduced the size of its IPO by around 10 percent. Multicultural reach . At MAMA, fans speaking Mandarin, Nepali, Tagalog and Japanese among other languages stood in the waiting areas, staring wide-eyed as the music videos of idols played over and over on the screens. The audience members knew everything about their idols -- writing down everything they said and did. It's dedication like this that keeps the K-Pop phenomenon going, and in return, artists give back forms of ""fan service"". Newer debuts like Crayon Pop appeal to fans by physically appearing before them at so-called ""high touch"" events -- more personal, face-to-face meetings that allow them to have direct interaction. ""At these events, we shake hands with fans and get their advice on what they'd like to see,"" said Crayon Pop member Cho-A. Acts also use social media as a constant window to keep fans' attention. Crayon Pop has a YouTube channel where fans can watch videos of their everyday lives -- shot and edited by their agency. The channel currently has more than 157,000 subscribers. Disconnect . Some fans, however, believe that despite these methods, the artists come off as unapproachable and distant. Fans say they want more of their idols, and they're not getting it beyond the tightly controlled images and videos. Dorothy Advincula, an assistant editor at the Korean entertainment news site Kpopstarz, calls this K-Pop's ""economics of scarcity,"" a method agencies use to try to keep the ball in their court. ""Artist agencies make it difficult for idols to relate to their fans beyond the stage performance. So the littlest sighting, the slightest glimpse with a photo or any kind of evidence becomes a sort of trophy,"" she said. Advincula points to the social media presence as a veil. ""While it's not unique to K-Pop, the response is different because there can be a disconnect on how idols and fans actually interact... while in mainstream, there is a certain consistency."" ""I think we've come a point of no-return where because of these bite-sized contacts... naturally fans get a bit greedier and demand something more.""","South Korean pop earned estimated $290 million last year .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The mantra of this week's CES, the annual Las Vegas event celebrating the world's latest and greatest consumer electronic hardware, is ""innovation."" CES has even officially renamed itself as an ""innovation event"" with its long time CEO, Gary Shapiro, launching a new book at the show this year suitably entitled ""Ninja Innovation: The Ten Killer Strategies of the World's Most Successful Businesses."" But the irony of CES is that there's hardly any real innovation among all the often identical-looking new cellphones, televisions and connected devices on show in Las Vegas this week. Sadly, this 20th century style ""innovation event,"" with top-down structure and centralized marketing message, has little 21st century innovation. Read more: Hordes, hype and glowing screens: Scenes from CES . The problem is that CES is a hardware show, but we now live in a software-centric world in which often the most interesting thing about electronic products are not their physical appearance but their operating systems. The real innovators today are thus the software engineers, the genuine ninjas, those ""hackers"" on the edge of the network who can quickly make and break any new electronic gadget. As Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape and now one of Silicon Valley's most illustrious venture capitalists, said, software is ""eating"" the world. It certainly seems to be gobbling down CES. Read more: New TVs driven by software and streaming, not pixels . And innovation -- for both well-established companies and start-ups -- remains everything. Hans Vestberg, the President and CEO of Ericsson, one of the world's most successful businesses in the global telecommunications industry since the late 19th century, told me this week: ""If we don't innovate, we lose leadership."" So how to find real innovation in Las Vegas this week? Like today's digital economy, the most innovative stuff can be found away from the center. CES's real edge is thus at its edge -- away from its 3,250 exhibitors displaying their 20,000 finished new products across 1.9 million net square feet of exhibit space. Away from the row upon row of identical high-definition televisions. Away from all those ""breakthrough"" cellphones boasting half an inch of extra screen space. Photos: New gadgets unveiled at CES . Yes, CES's real edge is at its edge. So the most innovative stuff I saw in Las Vegas this week were at a ""hackathon"" at Las Vegas' Palms hotel, a couple of miles from the main convention hall. Organized by AT&T, the old Ma Bell teleco that is now reinventing itself as open-source technology company, and sponsored by GM, Nokia and Ericsson, this hackathon (where, full disclosure, I was an unpaid official judge) invited software programmers to leverage AT&T's data network to innovate new electronic products. And innovate they did. More than 70 teams -- a record for an AT&T hackathon - entered the 24-hour competition to come up with new hardware and software products. The results were stunning. From the reinvention of the car control system, to handless driving apps to a Facebook style audio app to text-to-speech and speech-to-text applications, the AT&T hackathon was a true innovation event -- and a splendid contrast to the all-too-often sterile atmosphere on the CES floor. Read more: The star-studded history of CES celebrity gadgets . This innovative culture was best captured by Ruggero Scorcioni. An Italian immigrant to the U.S. with a PhD in neuroscience from George Mason university, Scorcioni -- who had never built any software before -- drove to Las Vegas from his home in San Diego to network at CES. He happened upon the Palms and, on a whim, entered the hackathon. A sleepless 24 hours later, Scorcioni hacked into a pair of electronic cat's ears to come up with a cellphone app. These brainwave neurowear ""Necomimi"" ears pick up our mood and Scorcioni hacked them so they could communicate with our cellphone. If we are too stressed, the electronic ears stop the phone either taking or making calls. Read more: 5 fun and odd gadgets from CES . The idea was so breathtakingly clever, so outrageously innovative, that Scorcioni's hack was voted the winner of the Hackathon and he won the first prize of $30,000. Not bad for a day's work by a guy who had never programmed any software before in his life and who entered the AT&T hackathon by chance. Now that's ninja innovation. And it's the killer strategy CES needs to capture if the show is to remain a successful business in a world being eaten by software innovators like Scorcioni. Watch: CES ingenious innovation .

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- His phone number was published in a German phone directory -- Rafid Alwan, whose claims that Saddam Hussein was producing biological agents helped launch the Iraq war. Rafid Alwan says he wants to return to Iraq to work for his people and his country. He was reluctant to speak on the record, initially denying he was Iraqi or that he was the defector dubbed ""Curveball"" by the CIA. But eight months after we first contacted him, Alwan agreed to an interview, and we met in an anonymous hotel room in a southern German town. Trying to get details from him was difficult -- he spoke at length, often launching into a flowery history of Iraq or a description of Hussein's crimes, and in Arabic, which meant we had to wait after each answer for a translation. We spoke for more than three hours, Alwan sitting across the room from me, wearing a stylish black suit. But in the end, he hadn't said very much at all. In the run-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell delivered a dramatic presentation to the U.N. Security Council. The United States had first-hand accounts, he said, detailing how Hussein was secretly creating biological agents using mobile laboratories in ""road-trailer units and rail cars."" As slides depicting drawings of the supposed germ labs flashed on a big screen in the Security Council's chamber, Powell drove his point home: . ""The source is an eyewitness, an Iraqi chemical engineer, who supervised one of these facilities."" Just days after Powell's presentation, U.N. weapons inspectors presented evidence they said disproved those claims. But six weeks later, on March 20, 2003, the United States launched its invasion, toppling Hussein's government in three weeks but locking itself in a war against an insurgency that has cost more than 4,000 American lives. No biological weapons, no germ labs, no weapons of mass destruction of any kind were found in Iraq after the invasion. Curveball -- Rafid Alwan -- remained in hiding in Germany, where he had been interviewed by the German intelligence service, the BND. Subsequent U.S. investigations into the intelligence failure around the claims found that German intelligence considered the defector ""crazy"" and ""out of control,"" while friends said he was a ""liar."" And, it turned out, the CIA not only never spoke with him, it never even saw transcripts of the German interviews, only the Germans' analysis of the interviews. Alwan brought with him to our meeting documents to prove his identity, certificates saying he has a degree in chemical engineering from Technical University in Baghdad and a student ID card from a German college. Multiple intelligence sources told CNN that the man we spoke with was, indeed, Curveball. But Alwan told us he never told the BND that Iraq was producing weapons of mass destruction, and he said many other things said about him were false. ""There are many wrong statements made about me, and I want to declare it one by one. I have documents proving that everything said about me is false,"" he said. ""No,"" he said, ""I never told anyone Saddam Hussein was producing weapons of mass destruction."" When I pressed him about Powell's use of his information, Alwan said in German with an Arabic accent, ""That is Colin Powell's problem."" He said that as long as he is living in Germany, he will never tell the full story of what information he passed on to the BND. ""It is not true that I am the only person who said things about Iraq,"" he said. ""There are so many other people who gave information as well. Right now I am trying to protect my children. They have been through hard times with me."" And then Alwan got nervous. He wiped his face often and lit a new cigarette after almost every question. He seemed uncomfortable in front of the camera. Alwan had brought with him a second man, introduced only as ""Mr. Ali."" Mr. Ali was also wearing a flashy suit with a peach-colored shirt, and he seemed to be coaching Alwan, making strange signals behind my back. As I talked to Alwan, I could feel the wind from Mr. Ali frantically waving his arms. Whenever Alwan began to offer details, Mr. Ali made a time out signal with his hands, and Alwan stopped talking. When he wasn't prevented from talking by Mr. Ali, Alwan answered questions in a roundabout manner, sometimes backtracking and correcting himself, sometimes telling completely different stories in the same sentence. Alwan came to Germany in 1999 seeking asylum and was picked up by the German intelligence service, which questioned him. According to intelligence sources, Alwan told the BND that Hussein had a secret biological weapons program, and that the cover was a seed purification plant in Djerf al Nadaf, a site just north of Baghdad, where mobile weapons labs in truck trailers would pick up the biological agents. It begs the question: How could the BND and CIA trust Alwan's information with the stakes so high? While he provided little detail during our interview, Alwan insisted that Hussein was producing weapons of mass destruction, and that he had worked on one of the weapons projects. Norbert Juretzko, a former BND officer who is familiar with the Curveball case, now criticizes the German intelligence service for its handling of the matter. The BND wanted so badly to believe Alwan, Juretzko said, that the case officers didn't notice inconsistencies in his story. ""He was put under pressure by the BND: 'Tell us something,'"" Juretzko said. ""They were desperate for something. They gave him money, privileges, a visa and the like. And so this man used his imagination to get all these things."" Alwan, however, claims he was never ""an agent or spy for any intelligence agencies in the world. And I never got paid by anyone."" Tyler Drumheller, the CIA's station chief in Europe at the time, said he tried to warn his superiors at the agency about using Curveball's information. Drumheller said he thinks the Curveball case is one of the lowest points in the history of the CIA, but he does not believe Alwan was at fault. ""He was driven by his own self-preservation, and then he got caught up in the story he was telling, and then he just had to keep going,"" Drumheller said. Bob Drogin, who wrote about the case in ""Curveball: Lies, Spies, and a Con Man Who Caused a War,"" called the episode ""arguably the biggest intelligence failure in history."" ""Never before have we gone to war on the basis of such an utter and complete fraud,"" Drogin said. ""After 9/11, what we heard from the authorities was that they had failed to connect the dots that led to that scandal. In this case, they made up the dots."" But Alwan made clear in our meeting that he does not feel remorse. He said he wants to return to Iraq to work for his people and his country. And, he said, he feels the Iraq war was justified. ""I feel that America offered to Iraq what no other country can offer to Iraq,"" he said near the end of the interview. ""America sacrificed its people and its money and its position to free a dictatorial country.""","CNN speaks to Rafid Alwan, code named ""Curveball""

"(CNN) -- Maybe it was just a case of delaying the inevitable during Monday's 66th Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony. Having showered an array of major nominations on cable, Netflix and movie stars while seeming to further diminish the so-called ""Big Four"" broadcast networks, Emmy voters in a sense recanted on the big night. Eleven of the 25 trophies -- an unusually high percentage these days -- went to traditional over-the-air networks, while Netflix and the marquee movie stars got shut out. As they've tended to do in the past, voters instead rinsed and repeated by rewarding previous winners. The six main categories are instructive. AMC's ""Breaking Bad"" defended last year's championship in the Best Drama Series as it knocked off HBO's much-heralded ""True Detective,"" which won just one Emmy all night. In the Best Comedy Series, ABC's ""Modern Family"" prevailed for the fifth year in a row, tying the record set by NBC's ""Frasier."" Netflix's drama-fueled ""Orange is the New Black,"" which entered itself in this category, did go to jail but did not collect any Emmys. Julianna Margulies added to the broadcast network glow by winning a second Lead Actress in a Drama Series Emmy, this time for her role in CBS' ""The Good Wife."" For the first time at any of this year's major awards ceremonies, Matthew McConaughey came away empty-handed in the Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his showy role in HBO's ""True Detective."" Bryan Cranston out dueled him and won his fourth Emmy for ""Breaking Bad."" It was Julia Louis-Dreyfus' night once more in winning Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. She won her third Emmy for HBO's ""Veep,"" and now is the only actress to take home the lead prize in three comedy series -- including NBC's ""Seinfeld"" and CBS' ""The New Adventures of Old Christine."" CBS and Jim Parsons combined again in the Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category. Parsons has now won four Emmys for ""The Big Bang Theory,"" which is still television's runaway most popular comedy series on all ""platforms."" For those of you keeping score, half of these marquee Emmys went to the traditional broadcast networks and each winner was a repeater. In what seem like prehistoric times, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox used to dominate ""television's biggest night"" before flaunting their Emmy wins as promotional springboards for the new fall season. NBC famously inserted commercials within the 1981 primetime ceremony touting the mounting number of Emmy wins for its then ratings-starved first-year series, ""Hill Street Blues."" The classic cop drama ended up winning six of NBC's eight Emmys on that night. And in its second season, ""Hill Street"" vaulted from nearly dead last to a top 30 finish in the yearly primetime Nielsen ratings. Cable networks, led by HBO, began flexing muscles in the 1990s, though. Series such as ""The Sopranos"" and ""Sex and the City"" became Emmy darlings while HBO's movies were perennial winners. At last year's major Emmy ceremony, HBO led all networks with seven wins, as other cable networks and Netflix combined for another 12 statues. That left the broadcast networks with just six wins out of the 25 major Emmys awarded. Whether it carries over or not -- and chances are it won't -- Monday night's 11 broadcast network wins are an overall morale boost compared with recent outcomes. Also left at Emmy's altar Monday night was movie star Billy Bob Thornton, an early favorite for his villainous lead role in FX's ""Fargo."" But the ""Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie"" Emmy went to Benedict Cumberbatch for his title role in PBS' ""Sherlock: His Last Vow."" Emmy host Seth Meyers had measured the traditional broadcast networks for a coffin early in his opening monologue. ""MTV still has an award for music videos even though they no longer show music videos,"" he joked. ""That's like network TV holding an awards show and giving all the trophies to cable and Netflix. That would be crazy. Why would they do that?"" Meyers could have been speaking for host network NBC, which was shut out Monday night along with Fox. But old-liner CBS ended up in a three-way tie for the most Emmys, at five, with cable's AMC and FX. HBO, accustomed to walking away as Emmy's top dog, won just three Emmys to tie it with broadcasters ABC and PBS. The Netflix shutout, following nominations in five of the six marquee categories, may be a message that Emmy voters are not yet ready to swoon over the ""world's leading television Internet provider,"" as it bills itself. Netflix still keeps its audience numbers secret for its streaming original series and also may have riled some voters by submitting ""Orange is the New Black"" as a comedy in what looked like a craven grab for Emmy gold. Indeed, Meyers basked in sustained applause and cheers when he cracked, ""We had comedies that made you laugh and comedies that made you cry because they were dramas submitted as comedies."" In this Emmy year at least, the broadcast network contingent has something to cheer about, too. It might well be a last stand, with an increasing number of cable networks making original and praiseworthy drama or comedy series. But for one shining night, broadcasters CBS, ABC and PBS can all say they matched or exceeded HBO. These days that's no small feat.","Ed Bark: Emmy nominations indicated Big Four networks were going to be losers again .

"Washington (CNN) -- It was a speech that Barack Obama -- a war-stopping, Nobel Peace Prize-winning President -- never wanted to give. A year after he pulled back from threatened military attacks on Syria over chemical weapons, Obama told America he now would launch airstrikes against ISIS targets in the country wracked by civil war. The nationally televised address on Wednesday night, which lasted less than 15 minutes, promised far-reaching impact that could embroil the nation in another Middle East conflict. ""This was a very difficult speech for him,"" CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said of a President who campaigned on ending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""He's inserted us into the middle of a Syrian civil war."" 5 takeaways from Obama's ISIS speech . ""Tremendous turnaround"" The plan to ""dismantle and ultimately destroy"" the Sunni jihadists who have taunted America by beheading two captive U.S. journalists calls for what CNN chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto described as a ""tremendous turnaround"" in Obama's previous policies in the region. After previously rejecting calls from top advisers to arm and train some of the Syrian rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad and ISIS, Obama now seeks specific congressional approval to do so. He also threatened airstrikes on ISIS targets in a major expansion of a campaign in Iraq previously limited to protecting U.S. advisers working with Iraqi forces and preventing the slaughter of minority groups by the extremists also known as ISIL and the Islamic State. ""I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,"" Obama said. ""That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq. This is a core principle of my presidency: if you threaten America, you will find no safe haven."" In addition, 475 more U.S. military advisers are headed to Iraq, raising the total of American forces there to 1,700 for a mission originally described as limited. Mission creep . ""This is mission creep,"" Sciutto said. The broad campaign against the ISIS extremists who have rampaged from Syria across northern Iraq includes building an international coalition to support Iraqi ground forces and perhaps troops from other allies. It answered calls from a growing number of U.S. politicians for such a step, with increasing public support for expanded airstrikes against ISIS targets. At the same time, Obama made clear the strategy differed from all-out war again in Iraq less than three years after he withdrew combat forces from the country. ""It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil,"" Obama said. Noting the formation of a new Iraqi government, which his administration has demanded, Obama announced that ""America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat."" Did Obama sell his ISIS strategy? Objective: ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" ISIS . ""Our objective is clear: We will degrade, and ultimately destroy, ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy,"" he said. Senior administration officials who briefed reporters before the speech on condition of not being identified said airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria would occur ""at a time and place of our choosing."" ""We're not going to telegraph our punches by being specific about the time and nature of the targets,"" one official said, adding that ""we will do that as necessary as we develop targets."" Also Wednesday, Obama shifted $25 million in military aid to Iraqi forces, including Kurdish fighters in the north combating the ISIS extremists. The aid could include ammunition, small arms and vehicles, as well as military education and training, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. U.S. diplomatic efforts this week seek to solidify the coalition. Secretary of State John Kerry left Tuesday to push Sunni leaders in Jordan and Saudi Arabia to join the United States and its allies in combating ISIS, while Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Lisa Monaco, the homeland security adviser, also will be in the region. Saudis part of coalition . ""The Saudis made very clear that they support this mission, they will join us in this mission,"" a senior administration official said. ""We are joined by very important Arab partners as well."" Obama has been criticized by conservatives and some Democrats for what they call a timid response so far to the threat by ISIS fighters. The videotaped beheadings of journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff by ISIS raised public awareness of the extremists and the threat they pose. ""We can't erase every trace of evil from the world, and small groups of killers have the capacity to do great harm. That was the case before 9/11, and that remains true today,"" Obama said in depicting ISIS as a threat to the Middle East, including the people of Iraq and Syria, rather than the U.S. homeland. ""If left unchecked,"" he added, ""these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region, including to the United States."" Conservative Republicans who have railed against Obama's foreign policy sounded relieved by what they heard. Syrian opposition groups, which have been battling the terror group, welcomed Obama's speech. ""Airstrikes on ISIS strongholds in Syria are a much needed element to degrade the extremist group's capabilities,"" said Hadi Al Bahra, president of the Syrian National Coalition. He said training opposition fighters on the ground will boost the effectiveness of the airstrikes. ""We therefore welcome the commitment to intensify the train and equip program to enable the Free Syrian Army, to eradicate ISIS and other forms of terror in Syria, including the (President Bashar) al-Assad regime,"" Bahra said in a statement. GOP says Obama is facing reality . ""The President's plan announced this evening is an encouraging step in the right direction,"" said GOP Rep. Mike Rogers, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee and has been a harsh Obama critic. ""Success will depend on the details of its implementation."" His Republican colleague, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, said: ""Tonight the President seemed to have faced reality."" Leading Democrats such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York praised the speech, as expected, while Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey said the Foreign Relations Committee he chairs would begin drafting legislation to provide Obama with specific authority under the War Powers Resolution to continue to extend military operations against ISIS. Meanwhile, the anti-war liberal caucus in the House signaled possible opposition by calling for a vote on authorizing expanded military action. Congressional authority . Obama has insisted he has the authority to ratchet up airstrikes against ISIS under war powers granted more than a decade ago to fight al Qaeda. ISIS formed from some al Qaeda affiliates but is separate from the central leadership of the terrorist organization behind the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Obama to Congress: No vote needed on ISIS strategy . This week, Obama asked Congress for additional authority to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels to fight the ISIS extremists, effectively shifting a covert operation by the CIA to a mission led by the Defense Department. Such authority comes under Title 10 of the U.S. code, which deals with military powers, and Congress could vote on granting it next week. Approval also would allow the United States to accept money from other countries for backing the Syrian opposition forces. Most voices in Congress back strong U.S. action against the ISIS fighters. However, any vote on military action can be risky, especially with congressional elections less than two months off. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Dana Bash, Faith Karimi, Josh Levs, Jim Acosta, Diane Ruggiero, Elise Labott and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.","President Obama expands airstrikes against ISIS to Syria .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The headmistress of the Indian school that authorities say served toxic lunches, killing 23 students, was arrested Wednesday, police said. Meena Kumari, 36, was taken into custody on her way to a court where she had gone to surrender herself, police Superintendent Sujeet Kumar told CNN. She will be questioned Wednesday and taken before the court Thursday, he said. Authorities had been working to track down Kumari, who had been at large since the July 16 incident. The whereabouts of her husband, who is not named as an accused person in the case, are still not known, Kumar added. Police want to question him in connection with the case. Pesticides have been found in the food and oil used in the school lunch that sickened 25 others in northern India's Bihar state, police said. Forensic scientists found monocrotophos, an organophosphorus compound used as an insecticide, ""in the samples of oil from the container, food remains on the platter and mixture of rice with vegetables in an aluminum utensil,"" Assistant Director General Ravinder Kumar told reporters in Patna. Monocrotophos, which is used for agricultural purposes, is toxic to humans. Bihar's chief minister, Nitish Kumar, vowed that police would investigate the poisoning incident from all possible angles.

When Akilah and Kris became friends in the 10th grade, she was the extroverted captain of the cheerleading squad and the student-government vice president. He was a precocious student (he had skipped a grade) and a serious artist who preferred drawing to, well, people. Still, they clicked.

She and Kris, 32, lost touch after graduation but reconnected through an old pal four years later. Their friendship picked up where it had left off and slowly evolved into something more. ""After one phone call, in which we joked about the typical day of a married couple, I knew he would be my husband,"" Akilah recalls. Problems started shortly after their 2002 marriage. They bickered over everything, from Kris's habit of leaving his shoes in the front hallway to how often the home office should be cleaned. (The couple jointly own their own businesses.) A slight difference of opinion would leave them fuming for days. ""We'd high-five each other if we could go three days without a fight,"" Akilah admits. The qualities the couple once prized in each other -- Akilah's verve and attitude, Kris's easygoing manner -- were now sources of irritation. When faced with a problem, Akilah preferred to lay everything out on the table, while Kris, who hates conflict, would try to drop the subject. ""Now I realize avoiding the issue just made everything get worse,"" he says. All that pent-up frustration was bound to explode -- and it did, on one wintry evening in December 2009. Akilah and Kris had taken their two daughters to a Kwanzaa celebration. When their five year old, Marley, climbed onto the stage during a performance, Kris was appalled by her behavior and gave her a stern dressing down. Akilah thought he was overreacting and angrily told him so. Kris withdrew coldly. The pair drove home in sullen silence, put Marley and her younger sister, Sage, three, to bed, and once again began to fight. Akilah knew she had reached a tipping point in the marriage. Throughout her teens, she had watched her mother struggle in a troubled relationship. ""I remember all the anger and raised voices,"" she says. ""My mother was unhappy but stayed with her boyfriend for years. That was not what I wanted for myself."" A few days later, Akilah told Kris she intended to call a divorce lawyer. He was shocked and saddened. But he didn't want to argue anymore, either. Numbly, he agreed. RealSimple.com: 10 ways to make your marriage divorceproof . Soon after, the couple sat down to rehearse how they would break the news to their daughters. And Kris surprised Akilah. Calmly, he started asking her questions that warranted thoughtful answers, like ""How can I speak honestly when you lash out at what I say?"" Once Akilah realized her husband was genuinely trying to understand what had gone wrong between them, she says, ""I was willing to stop saying 'I quit' and get into the thick of things with him."" Akilah and Kris discussed what was upsetting about the other's communication style. Kris felt Akilah tended to cross-examine him. Akilah needed Kris to talk to her rather than retreat. To break the cycle, Kris proposed they set aside a period of time to think through an issue before hashing out a solution. And when Akilah felt herself acting like an imperious prosecutor, she would reach out and take Kris's hand. ""That simple gesture reminded me of what matters -- our relationship -- not the details of some trivial incident,"" she says. Today the two still have their scuffles, ""but we get through the conflicts better and faster,"" says Kris. During a recent trip to New York City, Akilah was irked when Kris scheduled a client appointment that took up some of the time they had planned to spend sightseeing. ""A year ago, we would have gotten in a snit and gone our separate ways for the day,"" says Akilah. This time they talked it through and took advantage of the hours they could be together.

"(CNN) -- Who would steal a Vietnam veteran's prosthetic leg? Police in Philadelphia are looking for a woman who allegedly ran off with Sonny Forriest Jr.'s fake limb outside Lincoln Financial Field during the Eagles game on Sunday night. Forriest often entertains Eagles fans with his singing outside the stadium, according to CNN affiliate WPVI. Forriest told police that he took off his leg because it was hurting him. It was on the back of his motorized wheelchair when an intoxicated woman in Eagles gear jumped in his lap and broke his microphone, he told CNN affiliate KYW. The woman, who appeared to be in her 20s, then grabbed the leg and ran off. ""She said, 'I will pay you for (the microphone).' I said, 'That's all right, baby, go ahead and have a good time,' and then she disappeared,"" Forriest said. This isn't the first time Philadelphia sports fans have ended up in the news for odd behavior. In fact, city officials installed a courtroom in the old Eagles' stadium in the late 1990s just to sentence unruly fans. In April 2010, a Phillies fan intentionally vomited on a dad and his daughter. In 2000, a Philadelphia Flyers fan ended up in the hockey team's penalty box with enforcer Tie Domi. And who could forget what could be the largest one-sided snowball fight in history, when Eagles fans pelted the Dallas Cowboys team in 1989?

"(CNN) -- College costs too much, both for students and for society as a whole. This year, according to the College Board, average published in-state tuition and fee plus room/board charges exceed $17,000 at four-year public institutions, a 6% increase from only one year earlier. In 2009, spending by Americans for post-secondary education totaled $461 billion, an amount 42% greater than in 2000, after accounting for inflation. This $461 billion is the equivalent of 3.3% of total U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and an amount greater than the total GDP of countries such as Sweden, Norway and Portugal. The public is taking notice. The Occupy Wall Street protesters have featured student debt forgiveness as one of their demands, and students in California have demonstrated several times in the past year after their tuition was raised twice. Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan addressed some of these concerns in a speech where he urged colleges to get serious about their cost problem. But there's only so much the federal government can (and should) do. The underlying structure of American higher education needs dramatic reform before there will be any relief in sight. Whereas private businesses cut prices for consumers and costs to themselves through efficiencies that increase profits and incomes, universities lack those incentives. Indeed, the typical successful university president views his or her key constituencies not to be the customer (students and their parents who pay tuition charges or the granters of research funds), but rather others -- the faculty, important alumni, key administrators, trustees and occasionally politicians. They please these constituencies by raising, and then spending, lots of money. They effectively bribe powerful faculty with low teaching loads, high salaries and good parking. They give the alumni successful intercollegiate athletic programs that are expensive and usually financed off the backs of students. They give trustees whatever they want, no matter how costly or eccentric. Universities do a second thing unheard of in the private sector -- they often deliberately turn customers away. A fast food chain or discount store succeeds by selling more hamburgers or television sets; no customer was ever kept from spending money at McDonald's by an ""admissions office."" Yet for American universities, the ""bottom line"" is measured by college rankings that often reward schools for turning people away, becoming more ""selective."" Many believe the Ivy League offers the best education in the world, so why do we encourage those elite institutions to deny access to thousands of highly qualified students every year? Like health care, prices are rising rapidly for higher education because of the predominant role of third-party payments -- federal student loans and grants, state government support for institutions and students, private philanthropic gifts and endowment income. College seniors who borrow to finance their education now graduate with an average of $24,000 in debt, and student loan debt now tops credit card debt among Americans. When some else is paying a lot of the bills, students are less sensitive to the price, thus allowing the colleges to care less about keeping prices under control. And the nonprofit nature of institutions reduces incentives for colleges and universities to be efficient. The key to getting costs under control is contained in three words that begin with the letter ""I""-- information, incentives and innovation. Customers are ignorant of college outcomes because we do not measure in any coherent and consistent manner what students actually learn, how well they do after graduation or whether they think better in a critical manner as a result of the college experience. Even basic financial information on how colleges spend money is often not fully shared with trustees or key politicians who help fund or oversee college operations. As mentioned above, incentives to conserve resources are few. Once, as a department chairman, I successfully battled for more faculty members to do the same amount of work, thus lowering productivity. The result? My faculty evaluated me highly so I got a nice raise. Where else do the employees get to decide who their bosses will be or how much they will be paid? If information and incentives are provided, innovation will come. Already, we know several online and other innovations can work to deliver high-quality education services at potentially lower prices. Duncan highlighted Western Governor's University, a nonprofit online institution, as one such example. Nondegree forms of education need more emphasis, since the number of college graduates exceeds the number of jobs available in occupations for which degrees historically have been desirable -- jobs in the managerial, technical and professional areas. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2008 some 29.7% of flight attendants, 24.4% of retail salespersons and 17.4% of baggage porters had a bachelor's degree or higher. According to my analysis of the data, more than 17 million college graduates were ""underemployed"" in 2008. Surely these people needed some form of post high school training, but an expensive four-year degree may not have been the best approach. Rather, perhaps we should be encouraging some students to develop skills at lower costs by utilizing innovative free courses provided by groups such as the Saylor Foundation and Khan Academy. College costs cannot rise faster than income forever -- we cannot afford it. Necessity is the mother of invention. Like it or not, American higher education is in for big change in the next generation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Richard Vedder.","College costs are rising much faster than inflation .

"Oakland Township, Michigan (CNN) -- The search in a field near Detroit for ex-Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa ended Wednesday, and as with so many past attempts to find him, authorities walked away empty-handed, the FBI said. Authorities resumed digging in the field Wednesday morning, and a law enforcement source said the search was expanded to a site where a house once stood. John Anthony, a former FBI special agent involved in the original 1975 hunt for Hoffa, said the tip from alleged mobster Tony Zerilli which prompted this week's renewed search was the most credible he's heard since Hoffa's disappearance -- though he still has his reservations, he said. Anthony said he's skeptical of Zerilli's claim that Hoffa was killed with a shovel because it wasn't the way of organized crime members in those days, who Anthony said would have preferred to shoot him in the head at close range. Asked if it was possible Zerilli was coming forward for monetary reasons, Anthony said, ""I think there's no doubt about that. The man's broke. He has no money. That's why he came out in January with this story on the insistence of his wife."" Vanishing act: The long, strange search for Jimmy Hoffa . A second day of digging in the field Tuesday yielded no sign of the remains of the former Teamsters boss. Agents began digging Monday in waist-high grass in Oakland Township, north of Detroit, a location determined in part from information provided by Zerilli. Media and curious onlookers gathered some distance from the private property. Oakland Sheriff Mike Bouchard said investigators were using probes to determine what the ground makeup is, but had not found samples that would require lab analysis. Two concrete slabs were removed during the dig. It's unclear whether the slabs were foundations for a barn that once stood there. Scientists from Michigan State University were at the site Tuesday to help with soil analysis. This is the latest chapter of the nearly four-decade search for Hoffa. It was sparked by ""highly credible"" information from Zerilli, according to a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation. Earlier this year, Zerilli, now in his 80s, told New York's NBC 4 that Hoffa was buried in a Michigan field about 20 miles north of where he was last seen in 1975. Hoffa, then 62, disappeared after being seen on July 30, 1975, outside a Detroit-area restaurant. The FBI said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to Hoffa's efforts to regain power in the Teamsters and to the mob's influence over the union's pension funds. Zerilli's attorney, David Chasnick, told reporters Monday that Zerilli was told Hoffa was hit with a shovel and buried alive. Hoffa still fascinates after 40 years . Zerilli published a manuscript about the Hoffa claim online that includes details of the alleged hit. ""He wasn't shot, he wasn't stabbed, nothing like that. A cement slab of some sort was placed on top of the dirt to make certain he was not going to be discovered. And that was it. End of story,"" Zerilli's manuscript says. The FBI spent months looking into Zerilli's claims before seeking court authorization to excavate the field and look for evidence of a shallow grave, according to a law enforcement source. Contrary to what's been thought for years, Zerilli said he was told Hoffa's disappearance was not connected to Anthony ""Tony Pro"" Provensano, the New York City-area Genovese family crime boss who allegedly wanted to get rid of Hoffa. Instead, according to the source, Zerilli -- convicted years ago of crimes in connection with organized crime in Detroit -- told the FBI that Detroit mobsters wanted Hoffa dead. At the time, Hoffa was thought to be trying to get back into a power position with the labor movement after his release from prison. He was convicted in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud. President Richard Nixon pardoned him in 1971. Zerilli was in prison himself when Hoffa disappeared. Zerilli, according to the law enforcement source, said that when he was freed, he asked a mob enforcer what happened to Hoffa. The mobster allegedly told Zerilli that Detroit's crime bosses ordered the Hoffa hit. They lured him to a meeting and then drove him to a farm owned by a mob underboss. The enforcer allegedly told Zerilli that Hoffa was killed and buried on the property, which covers several acres. The area being searched was described as relatively small, about the size of a small party tent, according to the source. Aerial video showed a somewhat larger area had been cleared of grass. Zerilli has been to the site more than once, said Chasnick, who declined to elaborate. Hoffa's daughter, Barbara Crancer, told CNN by phone Tuesday that she is always appreciative when the FBI follows credible leads in the case. But, she said, she doesn't want to get her hopes up. ""We've been through it too many times,"" she said. FBI Special Agent Bob Foley, head of the agency's Detroit office, told CNN at the scene that the information leading to the search ""reached the threshold of probable cause, which was sufficient to allow us to obtain a search warrant."" The paperwork supporting the search warrant is under seal. ""If it didn't rise to that level then, certainly, we wouldn't be out here,"" Foley said. Hoffa's disappearance and presumed death have vexed investigators. As recently as October, soil samples were taken from a home in a suburban Detroit community after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried in the yard a day after Hoffa disappeared. The soil samples were tested, and showed no evidence of human remains or decomposition. Zerilli was freed in 2008 after his last prison sentence. Keith Corbett, a former U.S. attorney, told CNN earlier this year that Zerilli headed a Detroit organized crime family from 1970 to 1975, but was in prison when Hoffa vanished. CNN's Yon Pomrenze, Laura Batchelor, Sheila Steffen, Poppy Harlow and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","NEW: FBI says the hunt for Jimmy Hoffa is over, no body was found .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of women nationwide are suing the manufacturer and designer of a hair smoothing product that they say caused them severe hair loss and other damages. At the center of the dispute is Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30-Day Smoothing Kit, a hair treatment product for women who wanted ""smooth, shiny manageable hair with no frizz."" Josephine Wells and Catherine Reny, among some other plaintiffs in a California federal court, wrote in a lengthy complaint that the manufacturer, Unilever, knew but failed to disclose that the product ""contains an ingredient or combination of ingredients that causes significant hair loss upon proper application."" That California case -- filed last week and represented by the Law Office of Jana Eisinger, PLLC, as well as Morgan and Morgan P.C. -- was added to several other multimillion-dollar pending lawsuits against Unilever as well as partners LEK and Conopco. They face various claims such as personal injury, negligence and false advertising. Unilever also failed to warn consumers of the product's potential risks to their scalp, even after it ""knew or should have known of its hazards,"" the complaint read, adding that it instead used deceptive marketing strategies. The product claimed to be based in keratin, a protein naturally found in hair and would not contain dangerous chemicals, but pictures attached to the complaint showed some women suffering visible bald spots, broken and discolored hair, and burned scalp. The product, which Unilever said was discontinued last year, might still be for sale at some retailers, said Amy Davis, an attorney with Dallas-based law firm Christiansen Davis Bullock LLC that's representing some women in a New Jersey state court. More than 380,000 units were recalled, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. The plaintiffs claimed the product deceivingly used an ingredient that would release formaldehyde -- a cancer-causing substance that could also lead to symptoms including irritation, skin sensitivity and breathing difficulties, according to the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Unilever said the product was instead formaldehyde-free. ""MY BEAUTIFUL ITALIAN HAIR, is damaged from this product from HELL!!!! Like I don't have enough grief in my life, now I have had to cut off about 5 inches of my hair, I've been having to condition it every day,"" wrote one woman on a Facebook campaign page launched last year aimed at collecting evidence of damages. ""This product from hell needs to be removed from the market. It's false advertising/misleading advertising and ruins women's hair!!!"" In an e-mail sent to CNN on Thursday, Unilever spokeswoman Anita Larsen declined to comment on the pending litigation. ""The company takes these claims very seriously,"" she said. ""The safety of all of our products is of paramount concern to Unilever."" Larsen added no other Suave Keratin Infusion products were affected.

"(CNN) -- For 17-year-old Nathan Stiles, his senior year was supposed to be the best yet. He was a straight-A student and homecoming king at Spring Hill, Kansas, High School, and was the Broncos' star running back. He was a starter on the varsity basketball team and loved to sing at church. He was the son any mother dreamed of having. His mom, Connie, recalls, ""He was an athlete, but school was important. His grades, his teachers and just having a family ... he had his priorities right."" The final game of his senior year turned out to be the final game of his life. Nathan died playing the game he loved, football. His autopsy would reveal he died of second-impact syndrome, when a player is hit again before the brain has had a chance to heal from an initial concussion. But it would turn out that those repetitive hits Nathan took on the field would also make him the youngest reported case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). It's a degenerative disease found in football players and other athletes in contact sports who get repeated hits to their heads. The day after homecoming, Nathan complained of headaches. But nothing unusual, until five days later, when his mom received a call from his athletics trainer. ""Nathan's telling me he's still having headaches. You need to go take him to the emergency room.'"" And so Connie did. Nathan had a CT scan and the doctors reported a clean bill of health. Yet, to be on the safe side, doctors kept him out of play for three weeks. Kansas is one of 34 states that require a player to be cleared by a health care professional before they return to play. In addition, Kansas also requires that players and their parents sign a waiver acknowledging the risks of concussions. When Connie and Nathan returned to the doctor's office three weeks later, Connie remembers Nathan turning to her and asking ""Now, Mom, are you OK with this?"" She didn't want him to, but it was hard for her to say no. ""You know, it's his choice,"" she said. His first game back, Connie remembers him getting hit. ""I saw him kind of get stunned. But he walks out and tells Ron, 'Oh I've never felt better, that was the best game, I never felt so good.'"" He even took his ACTs the following day and had no complaints. The headaches that had bothered Nathan several weeks before were gone, or at least appeared so to his parents. The following week was the final game of his career. Nathan intercepted the ball and sprinted toward the end zone. Touchdown. ""If you would watch him run, he had a flow about him that was just beautiful. I mean it looked so graceful,"" remembers his dad, Ron. But right before halftime, his parents noticed Nathan was acting strangely. ""I watched him walk off the field, and I said, 'He's walking funny.' I mean, I know that kid so well,"" said Connie. Her phone rang. It was someone on the bench by Nathan. ""Get over here. Something's wrong,"" she heard. By the time Ron and Connie made it to the bench, it was too late. Nathan had collapsed on the sidelines. His mother rushed to his side, trying to get him to wake up. ""Come on buddy, it's your mama, come on!"" she urged. But instead of waking up, Nathan began seizuring. He was airlifted to The University of Kansas Medical Center, some 50 miles away, and rushed into surgery. Four hours later, the doctors came out to tell Ron and Connie they stopped the bleeding in his brain, but Nathan's lungs and heart were too weak to go on. By 4 a.m. the following morning, Nathan was off life support. Nathan's autopsy revealed he died from multiple hits to the head, also known as second impact syndrome. As Ron and Connie tried to determine what was next, Ron received a call he never expected. ""You know when you get a telephone call after your son dies saying they want your son's brain, sometimes that's a hard call to get."" On the other end of the line was Chris Nowinski, one of the co-directors of the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. The center works with the VA Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy (CSTE) Brain Bank, and together they work to understand what those hard hits on the field are doing to the brain, by looking inside the brain. Nowinski spends his time tracking football and sport related deaths and having to make the difficult calls to their families. ""I have called hundred of families within 48 hours of their loved ones dying, and it's never easy."" Instead he focuses on the fact that the bank's work will protect families in the future. ""I hate every call we make, but you know, I honestly, I have to prep and think of the positives that come out of it."" The Brain Bank is the world's largest collection of athlete brains. Since its inception in 2008, the bank has documented more than 50 cases of CTE. Much of that work is in the hands of Dr. Ann McKee, the bank's director and neuropathologist. She actually dissects the brain to track the trauma, and what she's finding in the brains of some players in their 40s and 50s is astonishing. ""You expect a pristine brain. I saw a brain that was riddled with tau proteins. I was stunned at how similar that brain was to the boxers who lived into their 70s,"" she said. Tau proteins are the same type of proteins found in brains of Alzheimer's patients. But to see the same type of damage in 17-year-old Nathan Stiles' brain was something that surprised even McKee. It's the youngest case she's documented, and for her that was a call to action. ""It tells you that we've really got to protect our kids,"" she said. ""It's not just car seats and seatbelts, but it's making sure that when they go out to play sports that we take proper precaution and we give them proper advice."" And that means making sure that athletes take the time to recover from concussions, and making sure they aren't playing symptomatic, while having headaches or memory problems. For Ron and Connie Stiles, the findings and the warnings were too late to save their son. But Ron knows that Nathan's legacy will live on as researchers learn more about concussions and how to treat them. ""I think there are some issues that need to be looked at, and I think that's happening,"" he said. ""And I think that Nathan is helping that.""","Nathan Stiles was the youngest reported case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy .

"New York (CNN) -- He might not be a household name, but Yousef al-Khattab and his Revolution Muslim extremist group have been pivotal in inspiring a wave of homegrown American jihadists over the past three years. Born Joseph Cohen, this American Jew lived in Israel before converting to Islam.  He espoused a radical version of the religion that he preached online and at public rallies. In a CNN interview last year, he professed his undying love for Osama bin Laden, saying ""I love him more than I love myself."" Today, al-Khattab seems to have changed his tune. He admits that his now defunct Revolution Muslim website became a ""bug light for Muslim misfits."" And he says he regrets that his message was taken by some as a justification to attack civilians. ""It was an idiotic thing, looking back on things now,"" al-Khattab said. He says terrorists who attack civilians anywhere in the world are ""disgusting."" Violent message outside a New York mosque . With so many of his followers under arrest, it is unclear whether al-Khattab means what he is saying or is just running scared. Either way, law enforcement sources say the collapse of Revolution Muslim's website and apparent conversion of its founder is a win. By CNN's count, in just the past 18 months, eight of the 27 reported cases of homegrown terrorism saw U.S. terror suspects frequenting, blogging on, or directly linked to Revolution Muslim and the Islamic Thinkers Society -- another extremist New York group that al-Khattab played a role in. Those cases includes the Baltimore man arrested Wednesday for plotting to bomb a military recruiting station. Maryland bomb suspect arrested . Despite the risk of eschewing his radical brethren, al-Khattab agreed to go on camera and state his new message. ""I regret anybody that would hurt an American civilian.  That I regret,"" al-Khattab told CNN. ""I think that's disgusting and I think that was never the message."" He says some of his previous statements, including his message condoning the Fort Hood, Texas, shootings, were taken out of context. ""My intention was not at all to inspire somebody ... to do an act like that,"" he said. Al-Khattab created RevolutionMuslim.com with Younes Abdullah Mohammed, who told CNN last year that ""Americans will always be a target -- and a legitimate target -- until America changes its nature in the international arena."" The two apparently had a falling out, and parted ways.  Mohammed has apparently left the United States for Morocco, where he is trying to start up a similar website, according to counter-terrorism sources. Another blogger who was active on RevolutionMuslim.com is now thought to be in Yemen, working with outlawed cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. Though law enforcement officials are encouraged by  the demise of the Revolution Muslim website, they are cautious about al-Khattab. He has been a rock star in the world of militant Islam. His extreme rhetoric, according to sources, attracted many young would-be jihadists. Al-Khattab says he is taking a risk speaking on camera denouncing his past because, he says, he will now be an enemy of the radicals he once embraced. But he says this is message to them: He was wrong, and so are they. ""If you think that this is the direction, to come to the United States and bomb and blow up civilians, you're terribly wrong and that was never ever the message that I wanted to give, it was never my intention."" He says it's ""not my fault"" that his actions may have inspired others to kill civilians. ""That's like somebody reading 'Helter Skelter' and saying that ... it influenced him to do the same thing,"" he said. ""I can't help that.""","Younes al-Khattab started Revolution Muslim with another American-born convert .

"Denver (CNN) -- The journalist who first reported about a notebook that James Holmes allegedly sent his psychiatrist before last year's horrific theater massacre could face jail time for not revealing her sources. FoxNews.com reporter Jana Winter has been subpoenaed by Holmes' attorneys to testify on Wednesday, but on Monday Judge Carlos Samour Jr. put off a ruling on whether Winter must reveal her source. Winter has indicated that she has no plans to identify who told her the notebook from the accused Colorado movie theater gunman was, as she reported, ""full of details about how he was going to kill people."" ""My reputation as a journalist will be irreparably tarnished among my colleagues and perhaps more importantly my future sources,"" Winter wrote in a March affidavit. Read the full affidavit . Days after the July 20 theater massacre in Aurora, Colorado, Winter scored a major scoop on FoxNews.com, reporting about the existence of the notebook. ""The parcel may have sat unopened in a mail room for up to a week before its discovery Monday (July 23), a law enforcement source told FoxNews.com,"" Winter's July 25 article stated. She cited a source who said the notebook contained ""drawings and illustrations of the massacre."" At the time of the article, the judge in the case had issued a so-called ""gag order"" barring officials from speaking to reporters about the case. Other media, including CNN, later reported on the existence of the notebook sent by Holmes to Dr. Lynne Fenton, the University of Colorado psychiatrist who had treated him. It has since been discussed in open court, though the contents have not been revealed. Samour said Monday he will not rule on the Winter issue until it is decided whether the notebook is admissible as evidence. If it is not admissible because it is privileged doctor-patient communication, then the credibility of the police officers who handled the notebook may be irrelevant to the case and not rise to the level required by Colorado's shield law for forcing journalists to testify. But if Winter is ordered to reveal her source and does not, she could be found in contempt of court and jailed. Fenton contacted police in June, a month before the massacre, and told them she had treated Holmes and he ""had stopped seeing her and had begun threatening her via text message,"" according to a search warrant affidavit. Fenton could face lawsuits that blame her and the school for improperly handling Holmes' treatment. Holmes is charged with numerous counts of first-degree murder for allegedly opening fire inside a movie theater, killing 12 people and wounding dozens more at the premiere of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Federal agents have said the 25-year-old former University of Colorado doctoral student planned the attack for months. His trial is scheduled to begin in February 2014. If convicted, he faces the death penalty. Holmes' attorneys have filed a series of motions and hearings in an attempt to find out who leaked the information about the notebook, calling to the stand all the police and bomb technicians who had access to the package. All have said they did not speak to any reporters about the package. Within hours of its discovery, a judge ordered the package to be sealed and it has not been viewed by anyone since. Saying they have exhausted all other avenues to identify the leaker, defense attorneys subpoenaed Winter. She appeared in court last week on the same day prosecutors said they would pursue the death penalty against Holmes, although she did not testify. Fox News declined to comment on the case or make Winter available for interviews, and an e-mail to Winter's attorney at Fox News went unanswered. The gag order is still in place, barring the defense team from commenting. Winter and her attorneys have tried to fight the subpoena. The New York-based journalist made it clear in last month's affidavit that her credibility is at stake if she were to reveal her sources. ""I will be unable to function effectively in my profession and my career will be over,"" Winter wrote. ""This is not an exaggeration - it is a provable certainty."" She also said she has been subjected to threats on the Internet by supporters of Holmes. Derigan Silver, who teaches media law at the University of Denver, expressed concern that Winter's case could have a chilling effect on investigative journalism and that journalists may be reluctant to pursue challenging stories that rely on confidential sources. ""As a journalist, you ask yourself, 'Do I sit in front of Britney Spears' house and snap some pics or do I cover this really important story and maybe go to jail,'"" he said. Silver argued that investigative journalism is in the public interest and Winter's case should be a rallying point for everyone interested in a free press. ""If people want good important stories, we have to stand up for the reporters doing those stories,"" he said.","Jana Winter reported on alleged Holmes notebook days after theater massacre .

"(CNN) -- Can you imagine playing a single video game for 10 years? One man did. And it helped him imagine something else: a bleak, war-ravaged future version of Earth. A member of the social news website Reddit who goes by the name Lycerius posted his results from a decade-long game of ""Civilization II,"" a turn-based strategy games in which players build their own society. His epic struggle pushed the game to its limits, further than developers ever imagined or planned for. The ""Civilization"" franchise is a series of strategy games that allow players to grow small tribes into large, sprawling nations. Players can manage resources, build armies and engage in diplomacy in an effort to grow their civilization into a world leader. ""Civilization II"" was released in 1996. But when the third version of the game was released in 2001, Lycerius said, he was already deep into his current game and wanted to see how far he could go. He doesn't play every day but returns to what he called a ""hellish nightmare of suffering and devastation"" when he has some free time. Now in the year 3991, his world is down to three super-nations, each competing for dwindling resources, and a planet left scarred by multiple nuclear wars. His Celts are locked in a 1,700-year war with the Vikings and the Americans. All other nations have been destroyed or absorbed. ""Peace seems to be impossible. Every time a cease fire is signed, the Vikings will surprise attack me or the Americans the very next turn, often with nuclear weapons,"" Lycerius wrote on Reddit. ""Even when the U.N forces a peace treaty. So I can only assume that peace will come only when they're wiped out. It is this that perpetuates the war ad infinitum."" Because of the continual fighting, he was forced to abandon his democracy and adopt a communist state, because his Senate kept overruling him when he wanted to declare war. Also, his cities are filled with starving people (90% of his world's population died from nuclear annihilation or famine from global warming) because, he says, he has to keep building war machines to sustain his combat efforts. ""So you want a granary so you can eat? Sorry; I have to build another tank instead. Maybe next time,"" he wrote. Constant nuclear bombardment and sabotage have melted the world's ice caps over and over again, resulting in the flooding of all terrain other than mountains. He said his world is full of swamp (which is useless for farming) and irradiated lands. ""Civilization"" franchise creator Sid Meier said developers never even thought about someone taking a ""Civ"" game this far into the future. ""There's no way we could have tested for this, so it was a surprise to us,"" Meier said. ""I can't say that we ever thought anyone would play a game of 'Civ' for that long. It's exciting that a fan of the series would dedicate 10 years to playing one continuous game."" Before you think Lycerius is just an unfeeling ruler, he said he does want to find a way to end the longstanding war. ""My goal for the next few years is to try and end the war and thus use the engineers to clear swamps and fallout so that farming may resume. I want to rebuild the world. But I'm not sure how. "" Reddit users have been filling up his post with suggestions on how to make his world livable again. And a new thread has developed, called The Eternal War, where players are chatting about their own experiences. Meier has a new challenge for Lycerius. ""We should probably send him a copy of 'Civ V' and 'Civ V: Gods & Kings.' Maybe in 10 years, he can create a similar scenario. We applaud you for playing what's sure to be the longest-running game of 'Civ' ever.""","Man creates ""hellish nightmare"" world in 10-year-long ""Civilization II"" game .

"(CNN) -- For most Americans, energy policy right now is all about gasoline prices. And given the political claims and counterclaims on this issue being tossed about, it's no wonder that the public is both skeptical and confused. Republicans charge that the president is responsible for higher prices at the pump, and a certain GOP presidential hopeful has even been so bold as to promise a return to $2.50 a gallon gasoline. How can the average American, already feeling the impact of higher prices, filter through the nonsense and noise? Critics of the administration are quick to note that when Barack Obama took office, gasoline prices were $1.95 a gallon. But they neglect to note the U.S. economy was in a virtual depression. For purposes of comparison, when President George W. Bush took office in 2001, gasoline sold for an average of $1.55 a gallon. In the summer of 2008, his last year in office, prices exceeded $4.25. In reality, presidents have little to do with near-term fluctuations in gas prices. Earlier this year, closures of refineries announced in the United States and elsewhere began pushing up gasoline prices well in advance of the coming ""driving season."" More recent increases are more closely tied to the delicate balance between increased demand growth and concerns related to supply disruptions, including but not limited to concern over Iran. The single largest component in the price of gasoline is the cost of crude oil. Federal, state and local taxes as well as refining costs, transportation, retail advertising and the cost of the service station lease also figure in. All things being equal, for gas to cost $2.50 a gallon, the crude oil price would have to be in the $50-a-barrel range (less than half of the current price). And to achieve this anytime soon would likely require a global economic collapse. With oil at $50-a-barrel it would not be economically viable for oil companies to bear the cost of extracting oil locked up in hard-to-reach places such as the deep ocean or oil sands, where much of the new production is found. Such a price reduction would, in any event, be short-lived, as demand would grow with lower prices while supply languished. For the longer term, the president's goal of doubling fuel economy standards and increasing fuel choices makes eminent good sense: It would make $4 gasoline feel like $2 gas to consumers. Also a very good thing. Republicans charge that the president has impeded domestic oil production, while Democrats are quick to note that production is at its highest level in years. Here, the facts are on the president's side, as U.S. oil production is at its highest level since 2003 and imports are below 46%. This is truly good news. Nonetheless, the nit-pickers are quick to point out that much of the recent development has been the result of technology improvements on the part of industry and is largely occurring on private, not federal lands. This too is true. The domestic oil and gas industry has been the source of enormous and valuable technology, innovation, tax and royalty revenues, and new jobs. But production is also up on federal lands as well. Critics claim that if the president had been more aggressive in promoting domestic development of oil and gas and increasing development acreage over the past three years, domestic production would be significantly higher and gas prices would thus be substantially lower. This assertion is false for a couple of reasons. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill (for which the president bore no responsibility) necessarily curtailed U.S. offshore production for the better part of a year. Additionally, exploration and production of green field projects take time -- several years, in fact -- and even modest increases on the order of several hundred thousand barrels per day in a 90-million-barrel-per-day world would not guarantee significantly lower prices at the pump. The president has recently characterized the latest iteration of his energy strategy as an ""all of the above"" approach, albeit with a continued emphasis on lower carbon sources. This seems to have struck a raw nerve with industry activists and political opponents, even though in 2007 the National Petroleum Council -- and more recently, Republican proposals -- reached the same conclusions. Similarly, Obama's language emphasizing the need for responsible development mirrors exactly what the industry said in a 2011 National Petroleum Council study and is consistent with the findings produced by Secretary Steven Chu's Energy Advisory Board with respect to shale gas development. Thoughtful debate here may be falling victim to politics and pique. Sloganeering and political infighting should not drive our energy debate when there are real challenges to be addressed. The bottom line is that we are all in this together. Regardless of your political affiliation, if the nation does well, we are all the better for it. So let's try to find some common ground to advance economic, energy and environmental goals where the opportunities present themselves and stop the petty bickering and finger-pointing.

"New York (CNN) -- For guests at a landmark hotel in the Big Apple, ordering breakfast in bed that gets wheeled in on a silver platter will soon be a thing of the past. New York Hilton Midtown, the biggest hotel in New York City, with nearly 2,000 rooms, says it will eliminate room service starting this summer. ""Like most full-service hotels, New York Hilton Midtown has continued to see a decline in traditional room service requests over the last several years as customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve,"" a New York Hilton Midtown representative said. The move will cut 55 jobs. Room service: A thing of the past? In the place of room service the hotel is trying a new concept: a cafeteria-style restaurant called Herb n' Kitchen. The self-service model offers options such as flatbread pizzas, sandwiches, and gourmet coffee. The staffing needs of the new concept are still being evaluated, the hotel said. This isn't the first Hilton property to get rid of room service: Hilton Hawaiian Village stopped offering it in the fall, replacing it with a less formal takeout and delivery option. Mark Woodworth, president of the hotel consulting firm PKF Hospitality Research, said this type of change is in line with what has been evolving for quite some time in the lodging industry. ""More and more consumers prefer to 'help themselves' to what they need, and the increased use of automated check-in/check-out kiosks and complementary buffets are common examples of this,"" Woodworth said. ""If management is providing a service that, at best, is only marginally valued by the guest, then there is a strong motivation to end such a practice."" In 2012, room service revenue represented 1.2% of total hotel revenue, down from 1.3% the year before, according to an industry survey by PKF Hospitality Research. Travel + Leisure News Editor Amy Farley says Hilton's game-changing move could set a precedent for other hotels. The best hotel room service . ""Expectations for travelers evolve,"" she said. ""Two decades ago it would have been unheard of for a major airline to not serve food, and now we're used to taking our credit cards or bringing food with us. ""Travelers are evolving to the point where they understand hotels to be full service even if they don't offer room service."" Some hotels are offering a new approach to room service altogether. In February, The Hudson Hotel in midtown Manhattan introduced the Hudson Common Express, a burger joint that offers the option of take-out or delivery of items like French toast, grilled cheese, egg and maple braised bacon sandwiches and kale Ceasar salad. The Grand Hyatt in New York's Times Square scaled back its room service hours and has a gourmet 24-hour market as an alternative. The Public Chicago hotel's Public Express offers gourmet meals designed by Jean-Georges Vongerichten, of New York's Jean-Georges restaurant, delivered in a brown bag at ""lightning quick speed"" to guests' rooms any time day or night. ""This casualization of fine dining is partly due to the economy but it's also a way that we're evolving,"" Farley said. ""We know that we can have an excellent meal at a farmhouse table and this extends to hotels. They'll rethink the white tablecloth and will instead offer room service in a box with no fancy silverware."" New York Hilton Midtown said the Hilton chain has no current plans to roll out the initiative more broadly.","The New York Hilton Midtown cuts room delivery .

"(CNN) -- ""You can hear the horse hold its breath over the jump."" Dennis Baxter has been listening to sounds for so long, he even listens to their absence. Baxter is not only a sound man, but ""The Sound Man."" His engineering helped form the beating, surround-sound heart of the revolution in televised sports coverage. ""If you listen carefully,"" he continues, narrating, ""you can hear the rider talking to the animal. ""Maybe a few choice words."" Baxter is best-known for his work at the Olympic Games, tackling the timbre of dozens of disciplines to captivate global audiences, winning multiple Emmy Awards. He is the man who first gave you the sound of arrows fizzing through the air in archery, thanks to his brainwave of microphones between the archer and the target. More recently, his was the idea to place microphones beneath the wooden velodrome surface, to intercept the rumbling of Olympic track cyclists in action. Baxter's job is to find the defining sounds of a given sport, and bring them to your TV in the finest detail. He believes that while most people think they are watching TV, how they listen defines their experience. ""The details really bring people in,"" he explains. ""TV is consumed in a casual way. Rarely do you sit with full focus on the screen -- you're usually there with your family, or your friends, and you're talking. ""It's the sound that brings you back into the show. The detail pulls the audience back in. ""The thing I like most about equestrian is that detail in the coverage. The little, bitty micro-sounds of the horses and the riders. ""You can close your eyes and hear the image of a horse. There is so much there."" Ask most people for the sound they most readily associate with equestrian sport, and the chances are it will be the hollow clang of a jump clattering to the floor. To capture that sound, Baxter uses an array of small, wireless microphones attached to the jumps on the course. Alongside those, sets of microphones normally used to record singers are placed around the edges of the arena to sample the hubbub of the crowd. (But never close enough to record your conversation.) Back in the broadcast truck, a sound mixer then has the job of seamlessly threading between these dozens of microphones to create the finished TV experience. ""The jumps are interesting because when they fall to the ground, it's never a flat fall,"" says Baxter, as though describing an artwork hanging in a gallery, or a fine wine. ""There's a nice, resonant sound with an echoing tone. The camera may not be on that moment but, when you hear that sound, you know exactly what has happened. ""But then -- and I've thought about this recently -- you have to decide if you want to have a constant barrage of sound or a coming-and-going. We give the sound a chance to breathe between the jumps. The more you listen, the more natural it sounds."" Like the horse holding its breath, Baxter is a fan of quiet as much as he admires sound. That extends to voices. ""Music today is so compressed that it never really breathes, and I hate to see television get that way,"" he complains. ""It does bother me that everything is driven by the narrator. You need to tell the commentator to shut up, and let's just listen."" The commentator, as it happens, concurs. ""I totally agree,"" says Steven Wilde, one of the world's leading showjumping commentators. ""I listen to a lot of different sports -- including our own sport and how it's presented in different countries -- and it's definitely possible to talk too much. You don't have to talk over every inch of it."" Yet if you are watching at home, Wilde's voice is as much a part of the soundtrack as Baxter's breath-holding horse. ""I grew up helping out at some shows. I used to be the man on the public address system. 'Please keep your dogs on a leash,' etc. Then somebody asked why didn't I try commentating,"" Wilde recalls. ""I was naturally a very shy person, it was the last thing I expected ever to be doing. But you take on a persona, I suppose."" Wilde now travels the globe, talking about horses for a living at the sport's biggest events. ""One of the main challenges is keeping it fresh,"" he admits. ""If you're seeing the same top riders all the time, you want to keep up to speed on them. News changes so fast now, so you're reading the internet all the time, looking at Twitter. ""That side generally takes a lot more time than people think. Today, for example, I've been at the show (in Los Angeles) chatting to everyone and getting more depth on how the horse is going, what they're doing socially. ""That gives me more color than picking up a piece of paper that simply says what they won at the Olympics. ""The hard part is not talking, it's preparing."" You now have Baxter's carefully crafted natural sound of the event, dozens of microphones mixed into a delicate blend, lapping softly below Wilde's narrative. There is at least one more element, though: music. Not a feature in jumping, music is a required component in sister sport dressage. The freestyle routine, widely regarded as the climax of any major dressage event, demands that rider and horse move in precise harmony around an arena, executing precision maneuvers to a soundtrack of their choosing. Once, comparatively little thought was given to the music used. Now, dressage composition is an industry in its own right. Tom Hunt composed the freestyle score to which Britain's Charlotte Dujardin won Olympic dressage gold at the London 2012 Olympics. ""The Olympics was the culmination of a lot of things, but making it was quite stressful,"" says Hunt of his patriotic theme, featuring ""Land of Hope and Glory."" ""At the Olympics, we had to do that -- and it was quite regimented, in a way. ""I had the most fun with the last freestyle I did with Charlotte (for this season). We could try some different styles of music."" Composing the music requires a degree of precision you might not expect. Hunt uses video analysis to fine-tune the rhythm and tempo of his composition, ensuring it precisely matches the expected movement of the horse at each stage. Sometimes, he will never meet the rider or horse for whom he is composing, working purely from video. ""For a rider like Charlotte Dujardin,"" he adds, ""I'll go down and watch Charlotte ride around, I'll take several videos, and I'll go back again to go through the music with her. ""It takes a few visits to see the horse, get the footage, take it away and work with it. ""Sometimes, the riders give me free rein with the music. The top riders often have a clearer idea of what they want, and that can help the process but it can also hinder it."" Hunt got started when he finished his music degree and found himself watching dressage on TV. (""When I saw it, it didn't seem like the music was fitting,"" he remembers.) Now, he is excited for the future. ""There's a lot going on in freestyle at the minute,"" he says. ""It's really developing and I want to see how it progresses over the next five to 10 years. ""People are getting better music and I think the judging will probably change, so it'll be quite an interesting thing to be involved with. ""It's getting to be a big part of the sport -- it's getting the crowds, and people acknowledge the music more. It makes the sport more accessible."" Baxter, too, is looking ahead. ""Wireless microphones on anything that moves, in any competition whatsoever, is the future,"" he declares. He sounds only half-joking when he adds: ""We're the ones paying for this. We're the ones who've got to put our foot down to these spoiled athletes and say, 'You know what? You've got to make it a show, you've got to earn your money.' ""We've been asking to put microphones onto the athletes, and the horses. We've not been successful yet, but I think, pretty soon, we will be."" On the horses? ""Absolutely. Absolutely.""","Sound engineer Dennis Baxter helped revolutionize TV sports coverage .

"(CNN) -- The FBI was expected Thursday to seize the original hard drives from the surveillance system at Lowndes High School, where 17-year-old Kendrick Johnson was found dead in a rolled-up gym mat earlier this year, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation surrounding the hard drives. U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia Michael Moore issued a grand jury subpoena to seize the hard drives, the source said. Kendrick Johnson's family waited months for hundreds of hours of surveillance video, hoping it would yield answers about their son's January death, but they were disappointed to learn that the four cameras inside the Valdosta, Georgia, gymnasium showed only a few collective seconds of Johnson, jogging. The camera fixed on the gym mats was blurry. The Johnsons' attorneys were not shy in stating their suspicion that someone could have tampered with the videos. Attorney Chevene King has questioned why time codes weren't shown in the videos. ""We don't have any time code with which to synchronize the events that are shown in the video. ... Either the cameras did this on their own or a human being interacted to make these cameras do these things,"" King said. Lowndes County Schools insisted last month that the video it provided to the family and CNN is ""a raw feed with no edits,"" and the county sheriff's office, which asserts Johnson accidentally died while reaching for a shoe in one of the mats, says it didn't edit any files, according to their lawyers. CNN, which filed suit to secure access to the video, hired forensic video analyst Grant Fredericks to analyze more than 290 hours of material from all 35 cameras inside and outside of the gym. Fredericks is a U.S. Justice Department consultant and contract instructor for the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia. Kendrick Johnson's family holds rally after filing complaint about missing organs . CNN also provided Fredericks and his company, the Spokane, Washington-based Forensic Video Solutions, with hundreds more hours of video from 31 cameras in other parts of Lowndes High School. Fredericks quickly knocked down most of the Johnsons' concerns -- they're all easily explained, he said -- but his examination raised what could be another mystery: at least an hour of missing video from all four cameras inside the gym. Fredericks told CNN he found that ""highly suspicious,"" especially considering how the material was acquired by police. CNN has requested access to the original surveillance servers, which has not yet been granted. But Fredericks cautioned that the video could be gone, as newer surveillance would replace it if it wasn't recovered promptly from the school's digital video recorder. The files given to him by CNN are not original, Fredericks has said. ""They're not something investigators should rely on for the truth of the video."" The analyst added: ""The investigator's responsibility is to acquire the entire digital video recording system and have their staff define what they want to obtain."" Coroner slams handling of Kendrick Johnson case . Authorities have said they didn't receive a copy of the videos until several days after Johnson's body was found, according to an unredacted report obtained by CNN after a legal process. According to an incident report from the sheriff's office, a detective watched a portion of the video, then asked an information technology officer employed by the school board to produce a ""copy of the surveillance video for the entire wing of the school with the old gym for the last 48 hours."" Five days later, the sheriff's report says, the IT officer delivered a hard drive to the detective, who verified it contained what he requested. ""Right now, what they've done, is they've left it up to the school district as to what it is they want to provide to the police, and I think that probably is a mistake,"" Fredericks said. ""You don't want somebody who might be party to the responsibility to make the decision as to what they provide the police."" Jacquelyn Johnson, Kendrick Johnson's mother, said of the case, ""We're going to fight until it's all over, until we get the truth."" Federal prosecutor will look into Kendrick Johnson case .

"(CNN) -- Lee Thompson Young's ""Rizzoli & Isles"" character, Detective Barry Frost, was given an emotional farewell in Tuesday's episode. The 29-year-old actor committed suicide last August, and his absence from the show has been treated with sensitivity. Young's Barry Frost has been written out of the show as a victim of a tragic car accident, and Tuesday's episode, appropriately titled ""Goodbye,"" showed the rest of the cast coming to terms with their loss. Angie Harmon's character, Detective Jane Rizzoli, particularly struggled with her grief and gave a moving eulogy at Frost's memorial. ""We shouldn't be here today,"" Harmon's Rizzoli began. ""Barry Frost was too young and too good for us to be here today. But yet, here we are. I've been given the incredible honor of talking about how much we all loved Barry, and I could say a lot and then go sit down, but it wouldn't do him justice."" As photos of Young flashed across the screen, Harmon's character pointed out that ""Barry was so many things to so many people. A son. A cop. A friend. I met Barry when he joined homicide. He was so nervous because parts of the job didn't quite agree with him, but he didn't let that stand in his way. ... He always wanted to try new things and push himself. I admired the passion he brought to his work. I will miss him as my partner. I will miss him as my friend."" It wasn't a stretch to imagine that Harmon wasn't just reciting dialogue as part of the episode's story, but was speaking about her former co-star as well. ""Angie was absolutely amazing in that scene,"" ""Rizzoli & Isles'"" executive producer Jane Nash told TVGuide.com. ""She was focused on the eulogy being exactly right, that it be reflective of Barry Frost's character and also be reflective of Lee."" Young grew to fame as the star of Disney's ""The Famous Jett Jackson"" and moved on to star in the 2004 movie ""Friday Night Lights,"" along with roles in TV shows like ""FlashForward"" and ""Smallville."" He'd starred as Frost on TNT's ""Rizzoli & Isles"" since 2010, and was in production for the final episodes of season four when he died in August. ""Our benchmark was, if his family chose to watch it, would they feel like we honored his memory?"" Nash told TVGuide.com.

"(CNN) -- As soon as he could, Kevin Ward Jr. got in a race car. As soon as he could, Kevin Ward Jr. started winning races. Ward was just 4 years old, not even in school, when he got behind the wheel of a go-kart. In his first race, he took second. In the next eight years, he won 250 events and six championships, according to his racing website. Racing was his passion, people who knew him said. ""He loved it,"" his next-door neighbor, Robert Shue, told CNN affiliate WSYR. ""He's just a good kid, a hard worker. He loved doing what he did, and he loved his family,"" Vicki Shue told the station. Ward died Saturday night from injuries suffered when he was hit on a small dirt track by the race car of NASCAR star Tony Stewart. The 20-year-old had gotten out of his car after a tangle with Stewart caused him to spin out, and he appeared to want to vent his anger at the three-time NASCAR champion. Police are investigating to see if criminal charges are warranted. When Ward was little he would hop in a go-kart and drive it until it ran out of gas. Then he would put some more fuel in and go so more, family friend Steven Mooney told CNN affiliate WHAM. People could see him riding his bicycle as fast as he could up and down the streets of Port Leyden, a village in upstate New York. ""He was always polite. He always said, 'Hi,' when he rode by,"" Larry Loomis recalled. As he grew bigger, Ward raced bigger cars. He moved from go-karts to Micro Sprints (and won 30 more times) then moved to Sprint cars. He was the Empire Super Sprints series rookie of the year in 2010 when he finished seventh in the points standings. This year he was going to try to squeeze 31 races into a six-month schedule. Mooney said Ward, who was brought into racing by his father, was an above-average driver. Chuck Miller, the director of the Empire Super Sprints series, told USA Today the young driver had potential. He showed a lot of promise and talent,"" Miller said. ""On the track, you couldn't tell him apart from a veteran. He had that kind of talent."" But there isn't a lot of money in sprint car racing, even for the winners. After high school, Ward followed his dad again, going into the family painting business. His father was there to support his son's racing career. ""His dad was right there with him every time,"" the mayor of Lyons Falls, New York, Katie Liendecker, told the Charlotte Observer. The family released a statement Sunday thanking friends and fans for their support, but requesting time to grieve.","Kevin Ward Jr. finished second in his first race -- when he was 4 years old .

"(CNN) -- A grand jury has indicted star NFL running back Adrian Peterson on a felony charge of injury to a child, spurring the Montgomery County, Texas, Sheriff's Office to issue a warrant for his arrest. Authorities didn't divulge details Friday about what led to the charge. But Peterson's lawyer said the ""charged conduct involves using a switch to spank his son"" -- explaining that his client did so while doling out discipline ""much like ""he experienced as a child growing up in east Texas."" Rusty Hardin said ""Adrian never intended to harm his son and deeply regrets the unintentional injury."" Rather, Hardin characterized the former NFL MVP as ""a loving father who used his judgment as a parent to discipline his son."" Peterson will travel to Houston and will then ""post bond as soon as it can be arranged,"" according to Hardin. ""(Peterson) will continue to insist on his innocence of any intended wrongdoing,"" the lawyer said. Hardin claims that his client has ""cooperated fully with authorities and voluntarily testified before the grand jury for several hours."" ""Adrian will address the charges with the same respect and responsiveness he has brought to this inquiry from its beginning,"" the lawyer said. Right after news broke of the indictment, the Vikings released a statement saying they were ""in the process of gathering information regarding the legal situation."" The team came back a short time later to announce that its offensive catalyst has been deactivated for Sunday's game against the New England Patriots. According to Texas law, a person can be convicted of an injury to a child offense if they are proven to have caused bodily or mental injury ""intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence"" or causing such harm by omission. A child, by this definition, must be 14 years old or younger. Peterson's indictment prompted a flurry of reaction on Twitter. Some defended him and criticized authorities for pressing charges, saying that such forms of discipline are common and acceptable. ""Adrian Peterson was indicted in TX for swatting his son with a switch! Who knew that was illegal, cuz my mama would b in jail!"" tweeted comedian D.L. Hughley. Others came down hard on the Vikings star, including one man who was ""sickened."" ""Anyone who defends this is a coward,"" one person tweeted. 2-year-old son allegedly killed by another man . The alleged criminal offense took place in Montgomery County, which is north of Houston. The 29-year-old Peterson grew up in Palestine, Texas, which is 150 miles north of Houston and 100 miles southeast of Dallas. A running back for the Vikings since 2007, he rushed for 75 yards in his team's season-opening 34-6 rout of the St. Louis Rams. In 2012, he was named the league's most valuable player when he ran for 2,097 yards, just nine yards short of the single-season mark, the NFL said. For all his exploits on the field, Peterson has dealt with heartache and headaches. That includes the death of his brother in 2007, a day before he participated in the NFL's skill testing event for potential draft picks. And last year, Peterson's 2-year-old son died after allegedly being abused by another man. Authorities in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, found that child unresponsive, and later determined he'd suffered injuries to his head consistent with abuse. Joseph Robert Patterson, the boyfriend of the boy's mother, was arrested and eventually charged with murder. Patterson has denied the charge and said the boy choked on strawberry fruit snacks, the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, reported. News of Peterson's indictment casts another shadow over the NFL, which is reeling from the fallout over then-Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Ric allegedly punching his then-fiancee Janay Palmer in a casino elevator. A New Jersey grand jury indicted Rice for third-degree aggravated assault; he pleaded not guilty and entered a pretrial intervention program for first-time offenders that could clear him if he successfully completes the requirements.

"(CNN) -- Since December 2010, I have lived with death threats because I have documented and revealed corruption at the highest levels in the Mexican government. My family has been attacked, I have to live with bodyguards and some of my sources have been killed or are in jail. But my case is just one of many. A large number of journalists and human rights activists -- as well as those who denounce corruption in Mexico -- receive similar threats or have been killed. And the biggest danger is not in fact the drug cartels, but rather the government and business officials that work for them and fear exposure. My new book ""Narcoland"" is the result of five grueling years of research. Over this time I gradually became immersed in a shadowy world full of traps, lies, betrayals, and contradictions. The data I present is backed up by numerous legal documents, and the testimony of many who witnessed the events first-hand. I met people involved in the Mexican drug cartels and spoke to police and army officers, U.S. government officials, professional hit men, and priests -- figures who know the drug trade inside out. From this I found complicity at the heart of Mexican government, business, police and drug cartels. Read more: Security forces responsible for disappearances -- report . The worst, and most violent, face of corruption in Mexico is drug trafficking -- an industry that is estimated to have left more than 60,000 people dead, and more than 26,000 missing in the last six years. And things are getting worse. Between January and July this year it is estimated that 10,000 people in Mexico have died at the hands of the drug cartels. Read more: Mexico reports more than 26,000 missing . The business of producing, trafficking and selling illicit drugs has become increasingly attractive to people around the world -- a lucrative market considering that consumption is increasing globally. Mexico is now the world's second largest cultivator of opium poppy and, according to the CIA Factbook, in 2007 was the largest foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine to the U.S. market. The story of how Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán Loera -- a man widely considered as the most powerful drug trafficker in the world -- became a great drug baron, the king of betrayal and bribery, and the boss of top Federal Police commanders, is intimately linked to a process of decay in Mexico where two factors are constant: corruption, and an unbridled ambition for money and power. Read more: Forbes drops 'El Chapo' from billionaires list . I read avidly the thousands of pages of evidence in the case of El Chapo's ""escape"" from jail. Through dozens of statements given by cooks, laundry workers, inmates, detention officers, and prison police commanders it was confirmed to me that in 2001 El Chapo did not escape from Puente Grande in that famous laundry cart: instead, high-ranking officials took him out, disguised as a policeman. Semi-illiterate peasants like El Príncipe, Don Neto, El Azul, El Mayo, and El Chapo would not have got far without the collusion of businessmen, politicians, and policemen, and all those who exercise everyday power from behind a false halo of legality. Read more: Are Obama, Romeny ignoring Mexico's drug war? We see their faces all the time, not in the mug shots of most wanted felons put out by the Attorney General's Office, but in the front-page stories, business sections, and society columns of the main papers. All these are the true godfathers of Narcoland, the true lords of the drug world. Currently, all the old rules governing relations between the drug barons and the centers of economic and political power have broken down. The drug traffickers impose their own law. The businessmen who launder their money are their partners, while some local and federal officials are viewed as employees to be paid off in advance, for example by financing their political campaigns. The culture of terror encouraged by the criminal gangs through their grotesque violence produces a paralyzing fear at all levels of society. Finishing this book demanded a constant battle against such fear. They have tried to convince us that the drug barons and their cronies are immovable and untouchable, but this book offers a modest demonstration of the contrary. As citizens or as journalists, we must never allow the state and the authorities to give up on their duty to provide security, and simply hand the country over to an outlaw network made up of drug traffickers, businessmen, and politicians. Since its publication in Mexico, ""Narcoland"" has sold more than 200,000 copies -- astounding in a country with high levels of poverty and incredibly low levels of literacy compared to the American-European book-buying market . It seems to me that the tide of public opinion is changing in Mexico; people no longer accept the view that the Mexican government are at war with the drug cartels. The levels of violence, murder, trafficking, child pornography and kidnapping in Mexico at the moment is simply catastrophic. In line with the increase in drug consumption across the world, the cocaine business has become more powerful than anyone could have imagined. The money created from this has allowed drug cartel criminals to buy whatever they want -- whether that is people, governments, police, land or impunity.

"(CNN) -- It was vintage Andy Kaufman: New rumors that he might be alive. This time, his younger brother gave it credence. Never mind that Michael Kaufman said he was with his brother when he died in 1984. Three decades later, he was now reading from a mysterious letter purportedly written by Andy in 1999 and standing onstage with a woman who presented herself as the comedian's 24-year-old daughter. The announcement just happened to be made at a New York comedy club during the annual Andy Kaufman Awards show. We lapped it up. Because we sooooo wanted to believe it was true: The comedic genius would finally make his grand return. An aging Tony Clifton. A triumphant Latka Gravas. A limping Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion of the World. Anything to keep the hope alive. Then, Michael Kaufman hit us with the next line: He believes he's the victim of a hoax. Kaufman has already been immortalized in the R.E.M. song ""Man on the Moon"" and in the Jim Carrey movie by the same name. His wrestling antics with Jerry ""The King"" Lawler are forever etched into American lore from Kaufman's infamous expletive-laced tirade on ""Late Night with David Letterman."" This week's news got us wondering why Kaufman still fascinates. Here are five reasons, in a reverse-order fashion he would appreciate: . 5. The Ultimate Internet Troll . Kaufman was Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat two decades before ""Borat"" hit the big screen. He was ""Jackass"" and ""Punk'd"" rolled into one. Kaufman was the Internet troll before the Internet was created. ""He was like that annoying house fly who won't leave you alone,"" says Bob Thompson, a professor of pop culture at Syracuse University. ""He was the opposite of a super villain. It's not like he could freeze the world or burn the world up. He could just irritate the daylights out of the world."" 4. The Big Rematch . Let's face it: How much fun would it be to see Kaufman step into the ring with Lawler one more time? The Great Ruse: The comedic genius who rocked wrestling . Maybe an Aging-Loser-Leave-Town match. Even Lawler pines for that moment. As the rumors swirled this week of Kaufman being alive, Lawler challenged Kaufman to hop back into the ring. ""We would have to have a rematch,"" Lawler told CNN. ""We could rekindle the feud with no problem."" 3. Milk and Cookies . He once took an entire audience out for milk and cookies after a show. Enough said. 2. Love Him, Hate Him . If you're 40 or older, you likely have some memory of Kaufman. On the sitcom ""Taxi."" On ""Saturday Night Live."" From Letterman. From comedy clubs. From wrestling. For that generation, Americans will always remember Kaufman -- as a comedic genius, as a befuddling buffoon, as a bulging-eyed maniac. ""What Andy Kaufman was doing was so new and so groundbreaking,"" says Syracuse's Thompson. ""The idea that you would derive humor out of stupidity and absolute nothingness, I think, was really fascinating."" ""He was doing a critique of the out-of-control American celebrity back when most people didn't even realize it was out of control."" 1. The Longest Joke Ever . Kaufman always talked about faking his death -- and doing so would be keeping within character, playing a joke long past the point of annoyance. The nation loves practical jokes, and clinging to the possibility that Kaufman is still alive lets us feel like we're still playing along. ""Andy Kaufman was often about doing an awful lot of stuff and enduring an awful lot of hatred and scorn before the punch line ever arrived, if it ever did,"" Thompson says. Think about it: The setup comes in 1984 and the punch line gets delivered nearly 30 years later. ""You so want it to be true because it would be one of the greatest things to ever happen in the history of comedy,"" he says. ""It would be the longest joke ever told.""","Internet buzzed this week after reports that Andy Kaufman might be alive .
Kaufman's brother ultimately said he felt he was victim of hoax .
People want to believe because ""it would be the longest joke ever told"""
"(CNN) -- If buttons are a thing of the past and touch screens are the present, what are the screens of the future? It's not a riddle, but it is a trick question: if the projections of companies like Displair are true then the screens of the future won't be screens at all but interactive images floating in mid-air. According to Russian designer Max Kamanin, creator of Displair, high-tech displays made from mist and air are ""the next step in visual technology"". Tired with ""electronic junk"" such as TV sets and monitors, Kamanin wanted to invent something that would allow people to display and interact with information without cluttering the physical environment. His solution? Projecting 3D images onto sheets of mist, giving the illusion of a hologram: ""An airstream is created from tiny water drops, similar to the ones in the clouds. The water drops are so tiny they don't have any moisture in them; you can test it on paper or your glasses -- your piece of paper will remain dry and your glasses won't steam up. We can then see images that are projected onto these tiny water drops,"" he explains. With the technology consisting of air, water and light Displair is one of the simpler concepts in the burgeoning holographic and 3D projection industry. ""I realised that everything already exists in nature and everything that people create comes from nature: we just need to watch it carefully and you will soon get your answers."" With Displair, users need not wear special glasses as with many other new screen systems because the image is being displayed onto an invisible screen; and that screen responds ""intuitively"" to hand movements -- 1500 of them -- many of which are similar to those used on our mobile devices, such as pinch-and-zoom. Today the technology is being used in advertising by big companies such as Google, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, but Kamanin can see practical applications elsewhere, such as in medicine. ""A heart surgeon could see in the air a patient's heart and could blow it up and search for information immediately without having to wash his hands."" The screen-free display comes at a time when concerns are emerging over the hygiene of digital multi-touch displays: ""By creating Displair we have developed a product which can be used as a public terminal for extracting necessary information such as timetables and restaurant menus,"" says Kamanin. ""It means that in the future when bigger displays are created numerous people can use Displair at the same time, play games and search for information."" Projecting forward, Kamanin says that in the future he and his team hope to explore scent, to offer users a multi-sensory experience. For now though, he says the basic technology needs further refinement to improve the picture quality and interaction speed.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The mother of a Valdosta, Georgia, teen accused of lying to police about an alleged confession in connection with Kendrick Johnson's death says her son has mental problems and is being used by the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office as a ""fall guy."" ""They have literally slandered my child, and I don't appreciate that,"" his mother told CNN in a phone interview. Her son, Dalton Ray Chauncey, 19, was charged with providing false statements, a felony, and arrested August 6. According to incident reports released to CNN after an Open Records Act request, Chauncey told neighbors he'd overheard two Lowndes High School students discussing their involvement in Johnson's death. Johnson's body was found inside a rolled gym mat in the old gym at Lowndes High School in January 2013. Sheriff's investigators determined there was no evidence of foul play and closed the case in May 2013. Chauncey told investigators two boys at Lowndes High School wanted to ""ruff (sic) him up but they took it to (sic) far."" According to the arrest report, Chauncey gave deputies only the first names of those two boys. Investigators interviewed one student with a name matching Chauncey's claim. That student denied having the conversation. Investigators say they were unable to locate any student with the second name Chauncey gave them. Lowndes County investigators questioned Chauncey about inconsistencies in his statement July 23, according to investigative records. According to the reports, ""Chauncey admitted he had fabricated the story while at the home of friends in order to boast."" The students he claimed had admitted involvement in Johnson's death ""do not exist,"" the report said. However, the teen's mother, Michelle Chauncey, says her son's story is true, but he told investigators he'd made up the story, hoping they'd end the questioning. ""They just went on and on and on, and he couldn't give them any more information and he said, 'OK, I made it up then,'"" she said. Michelle Chauncey told CNN she has problems with the way investigators interviewed her son, explaining that Dalton has mental issues. ""Really and truly, he shouldn't have been in there alone,"" his mother said. ""I told (Det. Jack) Winningham he had mental issues twice."" Her son ""may have some mental problems that prevent Dalton from performing certain work-related tasks,"" according to a March 2013 letter from the Social Security Administration provided to CNN by the Chauncey family. ""He's bipolar. His comprehension level is not like ours,"" Michelle Chauncey said. Chauncey's family did not provide documents to CNN to support their claim of bipolar disorder. ""Anything with his hands, he can do it. But sitting down and thinking something out, no,"" Michelle Chauncey said. Dalton Chauncey dropped out of the special education program at Lowndes High School in March, according to his mother. Chauncey told investigators he was ""kicked out of school,"" according to an incident report. ""He's a good-hearted boy. He just gets screwed over a lot,"" his mother said. According to an incident report, sheriff's investigators asked Chauncey to take a polygraph test July 29. Chauncey declined and told a detective ""it was all over because he made it all up and it was a lie,"" according to the report. A warrant was issued for Chauncey's arrest July 30. He was arrested the following week. ""(Det.) Winningham said he'd remain anonymous and he wouldn't get in no trouble,"" Michelle Chauncey said. Michelle Chauncey says she spoke with her son by phone while he was being held at Lowndes County Jail. ""He said, 'Mama, I didn't lie about anything. The simple fact is they wouldn't leave me alone,'"" she said. Chauncey was released on a $2,500 bond August 7. ""He told the truth. I asked him several times if he was telling the truth and he said, 'Mama, I'm telling the truth. I thought I was doing the right thing, and it backfired in my face,'"" Michelle Chauncey said. In a written statement to CNN, an attorney for the sheriff's office wrote: ""The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office has provided the records regarding the charges against Mr. Chauncey because of their relationship to the Kendrick Johnson investigation. ""However, the charges against Mr. Chauncey remain pending and any further communication about those charges would not be appropriate at this time."" On May 2, 2013, the same day the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office closed its investigation into Johnson's death, the state Medical Examiner's Office determined Johnson, 17, died of positional asphyxia after having accidentally slipped into the mat while reaching for a shoe. Johnson's parents later hired an independent pathologist who found evidence of ""unexplained, blunt force trauma"" to the neck and classified the teen's death as a homicide. Johnson's parents and their attorneys have accused the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office of covering up a murder. Sheriff's office: Claim of confession in Kendrick Johnson death not credible . ""They done this to my young'un,"" Michelle Chauncey said of her son's treatment. Speaking of Johnson's death, in her view ""they're covering it up."" Kendrick Johnson footage released; expert finds it 'highly suspicious' The sheriff's office has denied wrongdoing. Michael Moore, the U.S. attorney for Middle District of Georgia, launched a federal investigation into Johnson's death in October. Georgia school officials sued in Kendrick Johnson's death . Attorneys Chevene King and Benjamin Crump have filed several lawsuits against Lowndes County officials. All cases are pending.

"(CNN) -- Hillsborough County, Florida, Deputy Kenneth Moon was alone at his station at a county jail facility near Tampa when an inmate attacked him with no warning. Moon, 64, was no match for Douglas Burden, 24, in custody on various drug charges. With Moon still in his chair, Burden put him in a choke hold and pulled tight. And then, surveillance video of the Monday attack showed, other inmates jumped into the fray. But the other inmates joined the fight on the guard's side, pulling Burden away from Moon and punching him in the head. One inmate grabbed Moon's radio and called for back-up. The inmates held Burden down until other guards arrived as one of them extended a hand to help Moon up, according to the video. Col. James Previtera, commander of Hillsborough County's Department of Detention Services, told reporters he believed that the inmates ""saved the deputy's life."" ""The response of the inmates in this case, I think, speaks volumes as to the fact that we treat these men and women ... in our facilities with a lot of respect,"" Previtera said. Previtera said that Burden was moved to administrative confinement after the attack and that Moon was not seriously hurt.","Deputy Kenneth Moon was alone when an inmate attacked him with no warning .

"(CNN) -- Three brutal executions. Three horrifyingly similar scripts. The video fades in. A Western captive dressed in an orange prison-style jumpsuit is seen kneeling in the desert, juxtaposed against a bright blue sky. A masked ""executioner"" lords over him, wielding a large knife. The victim's last words are seemingly scripted by his captors. The masked man speaks. He lifts the blade. The video fades to black. ISIS has released video in which it executes David Haines, the third Western captive beheaded by the militant Sunni group. It's titled a ""message to the allies of America,"" similar to what ISIS called the first two videos. The semantics of all three videos have slight differences, but the choreography is strikingly alike. British hostage of ISIS was helping displaced Syrians, aid group says . The executioner . The executioner in the video posted Saturday appears to be the same person, speaking in what sounds like the same British accent as the man who purportedly killed American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. ""It sounds, and he looks very much, like the same executioner that we've seen in the two previous killings,"" CNN's Nic Robertson said. ""That accent there is unmistakably British."" The executioner is dressed identically in all three videos; black garb covering everything almost but his eyes, a leather strap with a pistol. In the first two videos, you could see his combat boots, but not in the most recent tape. He appears to be of similar build and height. He waves a knife in his left hand, as did the militant in the previous two videos. The first portion of the video starts off as the other ones did -- with a clip of a Western leader stating his support in the fight against ISIS. This time, it is British Prime Minister David Cameron explaining his backing of the coalition supporting the Peshmerga in northern Iraq. Before the masked killer takes the life of his captive, he addresses the leader of his victim's country, referring to recent airstrikes conducted by the United States in Iraq. Prior to Foley's killing, the executioner refers to U.S. strikes that helped break the siege of the Sinjar Mountains in an attempt to rescue the Yazidis trapped there. Prior to Sotloff's killing, the executioner refers to the strikes that helped break the siege of Amerli, home to many of Iraq's Shiite Turkmen. This time? ""Your evil alliance with America which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha dam, will only accelerate your destruction and claim the role of the obedient lap dog,"" he said, directing his remarks at Britain. ""Cameron will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war."" At the end, the executioner threatens the life of another captive -- this time, ISIS claims it has Alan Henning, another abducted British aid worker. ""This is stereotypical for what we've seen,"" Robertson said. ""Unfortunately, this has to be said, that the outlook at the moment for Mr. Henning is not a strong one."" Following Foley's death, the British ambassador to the United States said that experts in his country were close to identifying his killer. He has not yet been named. ISIS executes David Haines, Cameron vows justice . Questions . ""The murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude,"" Cameron said late Saturday. ""We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes."" In the case of the first two videos, the U.S. intelligence community has been analyzing them to try to answer some key questions: When were they shot? Where were they shot? Is the killer the same person? One forensics expert has raised the issue that there appear to be two militants in the Foley video. The second militant appears on the video after an obvious edit. ""There's definitely a change of actor,"" said Ross Patel, the forensics expert. ""There are noticeable -- there are subtle -- but there are also noticeable changes in their build, their physical appearance."" In the Sotloff and Haines video, the picture fades to black immediately before and after the start of the beheading so, again, it's not immediately clear whether the man speaking is the same man who then killed the journalist. Who is ISIS? Statement from family of David Haines . CNN's Tom Foreman, Jim Acosta, Steve Almasy, Deborah Bloom and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.","ISIS videos have similar visual and language details .

"(CNN) -- Consider it the taxonomist's equivalent of a People magazine's Most Beautiful List. An international committee made up of scientists and related experts has announced its top 10 of nearly 18,000 new species named in the previous year, according to a news release from the International Institute for Species Exploration, part of the State University of New York's College of Environmental Science and Forestry. The alphabetical list was launched in 2008 and is released each May 23, the birthday of 18th-century Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus, who is considered the father of modern taxonomy. It is ""a way to call attention to species that are going extinct faster than they are being identified,"" the institute said in the release. Scientists believe 10 million species await discovery, five times the number that are already known to science. The Top 10 New Species of 2014 . Olinguito (Bassaricyon neblina) Location: South America . This small mammal with fluffy red-orange fur, a short bushy tail, and an adorable, rounded face has leapt onto the raccoon family tree. Last summer, Scientists at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington announced the discovery of a new species of mammal called the olinguito (pronounced oh-lin-GHEE-toe) -- the first mammalian carnivore species to be newly identified in the Americas in 35 years, according to Kristofer Helgen, curator of mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. Previously, scientists had assumed that olinguitos were members of their sister species, the olingos, Helgen said in August when the discovery was announced. Olingos are larger, less furry and have longer faces than the newly discovered species. Researchers say the olinguito primarily eats fruits, but also insects and nectar, and its activity is mostly at night. The animal lives in the trees and can jump from one to another. At about 2Â½ feet long from nose to tail, the olinguito weighs about 2 pounds and is a little smaller than a house cat. The olinguito's misty, high-elevation habitats in Colombia and Ecuador, and the tendency for the animal to stay in the trees, helped keep the species relatively obscure to scientists previously, Helgen said. Kaweesak's Dragon Tree (Dracaena kaweesakii) Location: Thailand . With its significant height and trunk diameter and multiple branches, it's hard to believe that the Dracaena kaweesakii went undiscovered until now. The species, a relative of the Canary Island dragon tree, was identified on the limestone hills and mountains of Thailand. Cream-colored flowers with bright orange filaments bloom from the tree. Because of the low number of plants -- about 2,500 -- scientists believe the tree is endangered. ANDRILL AnemoneI (Edwardsiella andrillae) Location: Antarctica . Scientists with Antarctic Geological Drilling Program (ANDRILL) were studying ocean currents under Antarctica's ice shelf. Setting out to test a camera-equipped robot, they discovered the Edwardsiella andrillae actually living in the ice. The sea anemones are less than an inch long and have between 20-24 tentacles that protrude in the chilly waters. While Antarctica is full of variations of sea anemone, these are the only known to actually live in the ice and it's still uncertain how they are able to withstand the harsh conditions in which they live. Skeleton Shrimp (Liropus minusculus) Location: California . The Libropus minusculus gives whole new meaning to ""popcorn shrimp,"" though the skeleton shrimp likely won't be showing up on any seafood buffets any time soon. The male measures just 3.3 millimeters (about an eighth of an inch) and the female is even smaller -- just 2.1 millimeters. The translucent crustacean was collected from a cave on Santa Catalina, off the coast of Southern California. Orange Penicillium (Penicillium vanoranjei) Location: Tunisia . This ""new fungus among us,"" is bright orange when produced in colonies. The fungus was identified in a journal published by the National Herbarium of the Netherlands, and was named as a tribute to the Dutch royal family, specifically His Royal Highness the Prince of Orange. This new species ""was isolated from soil in Tunisia,"" the release said. Leaf-tailed Gecko (Saltuarius eximius) Location: Australia . You might have to look hard for this gecko. Not only was it discovered in an isolated rainforest in the Melville Range of eastern Australia, but its long, slender body, short head and spotted coloring help the creature stay hidden in the rocky terrains where it lives. Despite its characteristically ""leaflike"" wide tail, which also serves as camouflage, the gecko only measures around 4 inches long. The Saltuarius eximius tends to sit and wait for its prey and usually comes out at night. Amoeboid Protist (Spiculosiphon oceana) Location: Mediterranean Sea . At 4 to 5 centimeters in length (1Â½ to 2 inches), the Spiculosiphon oceana is one of the largest unicellular organisms in the Mediterranean Sea. The body of the creature is stalklike, expanding to a bulb with spicules, like microscopic tentacles, that absorb food like a sponge. The Spiculosophon oceana lives off the southeast coast of Spain in underwater caves. Clean Room Microbes (Tersicoccus phoenicis) Locations: Florida and French Guiana . In an effort to prevent unauthorized earthly organisms from making their way into space, NASA makes every effort to disinfect rooms where spacecraft are assembled. Yet, it was in two of these ""clean rooms"" -- 2,500 miles away from each other -- at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and European Space Agency in French Guiana -- where the microbial species Tersicoccus phoenicis was discovered. The berry-shaped bacteria can withstand stresses such as drying, chemical cleaning, ultraviolet treatments and lack of nutrients, and also show elevated resistance to spacecraft sterilization methods such as heating and peroxide treatment. Itsy bitsy dinosaur was T. rex cousin . Tinkerbell Fairyfly (Tinkerbella nana) Location: Costa Rica . Don't let the name fool you -- while Tinkerbella nana evokes images of Peter Pan's angelic fairy friend, this species, found in rainforests of Costa Rica, is the newest member of the wasp family. Tinkerbella nana measures 250 micrometers (0.00984 inches) long, just 2.5 times the width of a human hair. Dr. John Noyes, one of the scientists who made the discovery, called finding the insect ""the equivalent to finding a solitary needle in 200 haystacks."" 9 places on Earth we know very little about . Domed Land Snail (Zospeum tholussum) Location: Croatia . The land snail was found nearly 3,000 feet below the surface of the Lukina Jama-Trojama caves. Its nearly translucent shell gives the animal a ghostly appearance, the release said, and the species doesn't have eyes. At just 2 millimeters in length, this ""slower than a snail"" snail may cruise the water currents or take a ride atop a bat or a cricket to get where it's going, scientists believe.

"(CNN) -- Designer elephants have invaded Hong Kong's Pacific Place mall, attracting a stampede of photographers and tourists. The Elephant Parade, created by Marc Spits in 2006, invites artists and celebrities to design and decorate large elephant statues to be displayed in public spaces. This year's collection includes pieces from fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg and local actor Donnie Yen. The statues were auctioned off on Thursday at Island Shangri-La, Hong Kong. The auction raised HK$2,150,000 ($277,398) for the herd of 31 elephants. Proceeds will be donated to the Asia Elephant Foundation, whose conservation efforts range from funding hospitals to lobbying governments. Idea born from a baby elephant . The idea was born in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Spits was vacationing in the northern Thai city in 2006 when he met Mosha at an elephant hospital. The baby elephant had lost her front right leg after stepping on a landmine. ""The hospital said it would like to operate on the elephant and give her a prosthetic leg but didn't have the money for that,"" says Mike Spits, co-founder of the parade and Marc's son. The first Elephant Parade was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 2007. Since then, the colorful pachyderms have been auctioned off around the world. The herd arrived in Hong Kong's Pacific Place, City Plaza and Citygate Outlets for the first time in August. Spits says humans are the biggest threat to elephants. ""The speed of human development, particularly in this part of the world, leads to a fight for space,"" says Spits. ""And the elephant often loses that fight.""","""Elephant Parade"" features series of colorfully decorated elephant statues .

"(CNN) -- Drama and Liverpool go hand to hand in the European Champions League. On its return to the competition after a five-year absence, the English Premier League club narrowly skirted past Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets 2-1 thanks to an injury-time penalty from captain Steven Gerrard. After all, this is a club that was 3-0 down to Italian giants AC Milan in the 2005 final and seemingly dead and buried before roaring back to win its fifth European crown on penalties. A night that started with all the fervor and emotion expected of Anfield on a European Cup night quickly turned into a frustrating one, until Mario Balotelli's 82nd minute strike. The controversial Italian striker, signed from AC Milan, has gone three matches without scoring since joining the club and relief was evident once he'd found the net. Anfield purred but perhaps neglected to remember that Ludogorets are no strangers to drama themselves. The Bulgarians made the group stages for the first time thanks to defender Cosmin Moti's heroics in the playoff, deputizing for its dismissed goalkeeper and saving two penalties in a shootout against Steaua Bucharest. And just as the game ticked towards the final whistle, Dani Abalo galloped through Liverpool's defense to score and silence Merseyside. The Reds needed a hero, and as is so often the case, found one in Gerrard, who dispatched a last-gasp penalty after Javier Manquillo had been fouled. Anfield could relax once more. ""It's always nice to win a game, especially when you think you're going to drop two points,"" Gerrard told ITV. ""The game as a whole, we didn't do better than OK and have a lot to learn. ""You've got to give (Balotelli) credit, everyone has been waiting for his first goal. It didn't go his way for a long time but when you've got his ability you only need one chance. ""The key tonight was three points before the performance but at Liverpool we always analyze how we've done and to judge that performance -- must do better."" There had been little to shout about for Liverpool prior to Balotelli's intervention, Adam Lallana coming closest in the opening half. The home side, who has lost two of its four English Premier League matches this season, were lucky to escape when Roman Bezjak hit the post with 20 minutes remaining. Then Balotelli's class showed as he pounced on a loose ball inside the area to prod into the far corner in front of The Kop. Liverpool switched off in the closing stages and when Abalo rounded goalkeeper Simon Mignolet to slide into an empty net, it looked as if the Bulgarians' debut in the competition would yield a famous draw. But a mistake from Milan Borjan allowed Manquillo to nip in and steal the ball, only for the Ludogorets goalkeeper to bring him down. Gerrard, whose performance inspired that 2005 comeback in Istanbul, showed composure to slot home from the spot and seal three hard-earned points. ""It was a great night for everyone at club, it's been five years so to get a result was excellent,"" Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers told ITV. ""I don't think we're at the level as we were at last year, but there have been a lot of new players come in and it will take a bit of time.""

"(CNN) -- Twitter announced Wednesday that it's adding new photo tagging and collage features. It's no $2 billion purchase of a virtual-reality gaming company, but the update will have an impact on Twitter's 241 million users who post to the service each month. The change lets you tag up to 10 people in one photo. Previously, you could work around Twitter's lack of image tags by just mentioning people from the photo in the tweet itself. But with precious few characters to work with, that could gobble up a lot of tweet real estate, especially if you were taking crowded group selfies. Image tagging is not an original idea. Facebook has offered photo tagging features for a long time and Instagram added its own photo-tagging option last year. Twitter also is now making it possible to pack more images into messages with a new collage option that lets you share up to four photos in a single tweet. Select the images and it will tile them into a neat rectangle. Previously you would need a third-party app to make a collage. These are just the latest features to make the jump between major social networks, which happily borrow the most popular aspects of competing services. Last summer, Facebook copied one of Twitter's best features when it added clickable hashtags to its newsfeed, and it tried to clone Snapchat with its Poke application. When Twitter added short, 6-second videos with its Vine service, Instagram quickly followed suit with 15-second videos. The new Twitter image tags won't count against a tweet's 140-character limit. Any tagged images will pop up under the Interactions tab, just like regular tweets in which you are mentioned. Twitter is rolling out the new features to users starting with its Android and iPhone apps. Once you have the new powers, you can start identifying friends in images by selecting an image and then hitting the ""who's in this photo?"" link below it. If you're not comfortable being tagged in images, immediately take a trip to the Twitter privacy settings. The default setting for the photo tagging is ""Allow anyone to tag me in photos."" It can be changed so that only people you already follow can tag you, or it can be turned off completely. It's also easy to untag yourself from any photos. Tap the three dots below the tweet and select ""Remove tag from photo."" People who have their Twitter accounts set to private can only tag people who follow them, and the default privacy setting for protected accounts is to not allow people to tag them in images at all. If you've blocked someone on Twitter, they cannot tag you.","Twitter has added the ability to tag people in photos .

"Sydney (CNN) -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has welcomed the return by Australia of two ancient Hindu art treasures that were allegedly stolen from temples in Tamil Nadu. During a meeting with Modi in New Delhi on Friday Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott handed over a 900-year bronze statue of Shiva Nataraja (dancing Shiva) and a stone statue of Ardhanariswara (Shiva in half-female form), also from circa 1100. ""I would like to convey to Prime Minister Abbott the deep sense of gratitude of 1.25 billion people of India for the efforts he has made to bring with him two ancient statues that were stolen from India,"" Modi said. Modi said Abbott and the people of Australia ""have shown enormous respect and regard not only for our ancient treasures, but also for our cultural heritage."" The National Gallery of Australia in Canberra bought the Shiva Natarja for $5 million (A$5.3 million) in 2008 from then New York-based art dealer Subhash Kapoor. Kapoor was arrested in Germany in 2011 after U.S. investigators raided Manhattan storage units allegedly leased in his name, and found items ""displayed in major international museums worldwide."" Kapoor was subsequently extradited to India where he's awaiting trial. The former owner of the Art of the Past Gallery, Kapoor sold the Ardhanariswara to the Sydney-based Art Gallery of New South Wales for $280,000 (A$300,000) in 2004. In March this year, the Indian Government wrote to Australia seeking the return of the two idols. In a statement to mark Abbott's return of the two statues in New Delhi, the National Gallery of Australia said it ""would never knowingly purchase a stolen or looted item."" It said the gallery had undertaken lengthy, comprehensive and independent research before it bought the Shiva Nataraja from Kapoor. ""Despite these efforts, court proceedings may yet confirm that the gallery has been a victim of a most audacious fraud,"" gallery director Ron Radford said. Radford noted that Kapoor's trial ""is yet to be heard and he has proclaimed his innocence.""","Australia returns lost art treasures to India, including Shiva Nataraja .

"(CNN) -- The shaka sign -- a person's thumb and pinkie extended, the rest of the fingers in a fist -- is uniquely Hawaiian, a way to say ""right on,"" ""hang loose"" or simply hello. But it turns out it's not the only way islanders have used their hands to communicate. A research group at the University of Hawaii at Manoa announced Friday that they had documented -- for the first time -- Hawaii Sign Language, or HSL, which deaf people across the islands' diverse ethnic groups have used for decades if not longer. While there is written evidence dating back to 1821 indicating such a language existed, beginning in the 1940s it started to get largely phased out in favor of American Sign Language. Quiz: How good is your sign language? Researchers identified about 40 Hawaiians who still use it -- interviewing 19 of them, plus two adult children, on four islands for their study. But they are all 80 years of age or older, making it imperative to act now in order to preserve it before it's too late. ""Researchers are committed to a long term study of HSL with the goals of producing ... a dictionary (and) archived videotaped data,"" said James Woodward, an Adjunct Professor of Linguistics at the University of Hawaii at Mano. ""It is also hoped that an effort can be made to revitalize HSL, so that it can be taught in high schools and universities in Hawaii."" Hearing-impaired people have found ways to communicate for generations, all across the world. That might mean tapping into a well-established language, like ASL or International Sign Language, or finding some other way to get a point across. Comic uses sign language . ""If they don't have access to learning a sign language that's already in existence, then a community of deaf people will find a way to communicate,"" said Leanne Hinton, a professor emeritus at the University of California at Berkeley. ""Over time, they will find a way to stabilize and have a structure that becomes an actual language."" That's what the Hawaii university researchers say happened -- even if few realized that a distinctive sign language existed for decades on the island until now. While the now-prevailing ASL has rubbed off some, Woodward said it's been relatively minimal among those practicing Hawaii Sign Language. Specifically, at least 80% of its signs are distinct, while the rest come from ASL -- which he said is enough to characterize it as its own language, rather than a dialect. For example, the Hawaii Sign Language word for father is to wag your finger -- whereas in ASL, it's an open hand with fingers spread and a thumb to the forehead. Want to say that someone is telling a lie? Then put an index finger in the middle of your throat. The grammar structure in Hawaii Sign Language also differentiates it from ASL, Woodward noted. ""Sign languages ... evolve in a community of users, and are not signed versions of spoken languages,"" the university said in a press release. ""The full history of HSL is yet to be told.""

"(CNN) -- The first President of the United States got it right. In his farewell address, George Washington warned of the ""continual mischiefs of the spirit of party"" making it the ""interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it."" In other words, he cautioned against the dangers of political parties. Washington was keenly aware of the destructive nature of political parties and was concerned they would ""enfeeble public administration."" With myriad affected agencies and thousands of furloughed federal workers, this is exactly where the country finds itself today. Washington is not typically held in the same intellectual esteem that some of his counterparts are -- Madison, Hamilton and Jefferson come to mind. However, Washington's farewell address is among the most prescient documents ever penned by a President. In it, he cautioned against the vengeful practices of political parties. To him, parties put their own interests above those of the country. He warned: ""The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism."" Both parties today would likely level such charges against one another, while most Americans recognize that both parties share responsibility for the current situation. In addition to his concerns about political party mischief, he also warned of the dangers of accumulating debt. He argued that for a country to enjoy safety and strength, it should ""cherish public credit."" Running up debt would be tantamount to unethical behavior to future generations. Tea party Republicans have succeeded in heeding Washington's concern by bringing the eyes of the country squarely upon the issue of debt. However, the recalcitrance of the tea party Republicans to compromise has also put the country at great risk, at least in Washington's eyes, given his dedication to maintaining America's credit. Washington was not a fan of taxation, but he abhorred debt even more. He wrote: ""It is essential that you should practically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must be revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant."" Washington encouraged future generations to change policies they did not like by constitutional amendment or through the electoral process, rather than positioning their party to enjoy short-term benefits. The first President's dislike for political parties still fits with the reality in which most Americans live today. Political scientist Morris Fiorina has argued that the divisions between Americans have been far overblown. He contends that the so-called culture wars are a myth. While the neat and tidy categories of red and blue states make for interesting media narratives, they fail to depict accurately the ideological beliefs of the citizenry. Fiorina points out that most Americans are not hard-core ideologues. On the whole, Americans are far more agreeable on most issues than the media depict. We love a good fight and as conflict tends to attract audiences, the media are quick to point to areas where conflict exists. Yet agreement among citizens is the norm, rather than the exception. The effect of the polarized nation narrative is disillusionment for many Americans and undue influence for the more ideological in our midst. Some context is helpful. While more than $2.6 billion was spent in the 2012 presidential campaign, 40% of Americans still chose to sit the election out. Those who do participate typically are among the most ideological in the electorate. This tends to produce candidates who are in turn more ideologically oriented. When more ideological candidates are chosen in primaries, it leads to more ideological choices for voters. These choices likely do not reflect the preferences of the average citizen but instead more likely reflect the preferences among a party's more ideological members. This cycle becomes increasingly embedded when congressional districts are drawn to support such a system. The end result is what we see happening in Washington today -- gridlock based upon both partisan and ideological whims. A common criticism is that both parties are putting their own interests above the interests of the United States. Once again, Washington offers good advice to our current policymakers. ""The name of American, which belongs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners, habits, and political principles."" For the sake of the country and the world economy, let us hope that our representatives begin to see themselves as Americans, rather than Democrats and Republicans. Thank you Mr. President. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Alexander.","Robert Alexander: Shenanigans in Congress show wisdom of George Washington .

"(CNN) -- All four people found dead inside tennis great James Blake's burning mansion had been shot, investigators said Thursday. Blake was not at the Florida home at the time of the blaze Wednesday and was leasing out the property, Hillsborough County Sheriff's Col. Donna Lusczynski told reporters. The medical examiner is working to determine the cause of death for two adults and two teenagers, apparently from the same family, Lusczynski said. Authorities haven't identified the victims, but they say Darrin and Kimberly Campbell lived in the house with their children, Megan and Colin. The Campbells had been renting the 5,800-square-foot house from Blake for the past two years. Investigators found fireworks throughout the home, and a surveillance video obtained by CNN shows a man believed to be Darrin Campbell inside a Phantom Fireworks store in Tampa, Florida, on Sunday, buying about $600 worth of fireworks. He walks out of the store with one cart, and an employee seems to help him out with a second. He bought several gas cans that same day at a home improvement store, and a firearm registered to him was found in the residence, Lusczynski added. On Wednesday, Lusczynski said the fire had been ""started intentionally by an unknown accelerant."" The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office would not elaborate on what they believe happened or on a possible motive. But investigators say they are not searching for a suspect. Firefighters first learned of the blaze in a 911 call around 5:45 a.m. Wednesday reporting an explosion and flames. Blake, 34, born in Yonkers, New York, starred at Harvard before breaking into professional tennis. He peaked at No. 4 in the world rankings in November 2006, according to his ATP World Tour profile. He retired from the sport last year, and remains active with his namesake foundation and Thomas Blake Sr. Memorial Research Fund to support research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

"(CNN) -- ""America's Got Talent"" found a magical winner for season nine. On Wednesday's finale of the NBC show, magician Mat Franco beat singer Emily West for the championship. Franco won a $1 million prize and will get to headline the ""America's Got Talent"" show in Las Vegas. The winner searched for words when host Nick Cannon asked him how he felt before finally settling on, ""Un-freaking believable."" Judges Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum, Mel B and Howard Stern would probably use the same phrase for some of the card tricks Franco showed them this season. Last week, he surprised judges with a reappearing card, and during the finale he managed to relocate cards from some surprising places. Singer West may have lost to Franco, but the runner-up sounded just as pleased with the final decision. ""This has been the most unbelievable experience,"" West told host Cannon. ""Thank you 'AGT,' thank you Mat Franco for winning and taking on the world. I am very honored. Thank you so much for having me on your beautiful show; it changed my life."" Indeed, West got the opportunity to do a duet with Cyndi Lauper during Wednesday's finale. Their performance wasn't the only shining set of the evening. Quintavious Johnson, 12, one of six contestants to make it to the finale, ended the season with a winning duet featuring Jennifer Hudson.

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Rand Paul has gotten questions from the media lately at nearly every stop and in almost every interview about where he stands on combating the threat of ISIS. Because he's seriously thinking about running for president, his positions on major issues are being carefully scrutinized. In an interview Monday on Fox News, Paul was asked: ""If a vote were to come to Congress to ask you to go to war against ISIS -- and to call it that -- would you vote yes?"" ""Yes,"" he responded, though he added that he'd try to sunset the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, a measure that the Obama administration is using as the legal basis for airstrikes against ISIS. It was passed shortly after the 9/11 attacks and has been used for military action against terrorism ever since. ""I do favor doing something about ISIS. I would vote yes,"" he continued. While Paul gave a general ""yes"" to the broad question of going to war with ISIS, his position appears to be much more nuanced. And it's possible he could be voting ""no"" to a key element of the President's ISIS plan in the near future. Paul has said he doesn't support the arming and training of vetted Syrian rebels to fight against the militant group. The United States has already supplied arms to Syrian rebels in the past year, and Paul said Monday on CBS that it would be a ""mistake"" to ramp up that effort. ""Most of the arms we've given to the so-called 'moderate' rebels have wound up in the hands of ISIS, because ISIS simply takes it from them, or it's given to them, or we mistakenly actually give it to some of the radicals,"" he said on ""This Morning."" Congress plans to start voting as early as Wednesday on arming and training the rebels. A provision is being added to a must-pass stopgap spending bill and is expected to pass in the House. It's also expected to pass in the Senate with bipartisan support, but the timing and process is not exact. It seems that if a measure came to the Senate that only approves the training/arming of Syrian rebels, Paul would not support such action. His political adviser, Doug Stafford, told CNN that the senator ""said he would vote to authorize strikes against ISIS, not arm their allies."" And what if President Obama were to come to Congress, as Paul has requested, and ask for approval for airstrikes and arming the rebels, all in the same package? Stafford said, ""There are a lot of variables and (Paul) will read the language"" of any authorization measure brought forward before he makes a decision. ""There will be many factors and the specifics are important,"" he added. CNN's Jim Acosta, Deirdre Walsh and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","Rand Paul says he doesn't support arming Syrian rebels in ISIS fight .

"(CNN) -- Four days after he was acquitted of murder, George Zimmerman stepped out of seclusion to help a family get out of an overturned vehicle in Florida, authorities said Monday. Zimmerman and another man helped four people get out of an SUV that had overturned Wednesday evening in Sanford, the same community where the former neighborhood watch volunteer fatally shot teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, Seminole County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Heather Smith said. America talks about the Zimmerman verdict . Callers to 911 described a dramatic scene: An SUV lost control in the area of Interstate 4 and State Road 46, flipping on its side and sliding into a median. Several callers said they saw people helping a family trapped inside the overturned SUV, according to audio recordings released by the sheriff's office. ""There was tons of smoke ... people were starting to rush towards the vehicle,"" one caller said. ""They got everyone out of the car,"" another caller reported. About a minute later, the caller said, it looked like the vehicle was catching fire. By the time a deputy arrived, Zimmerman and another man already had helped the two adults and two children out of the vehicle, Smith said. Zimmerman did not witness the crash, and he left after making contact with the deputy, Smith said. No injuries were reported in the crash. 'Stand Your Ground' laws up to states . Zimmerman has been out of the public eye since a jury found him not guilty of second degree murder on July 13. His parents told ABC News last week that their family has received an ""enormous amount of death threats."" He fatally shot Martin in the Sanford neighborhood where Zimmerman and Martin's father lived in February 2012. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, had a confrontation with the unarmed African-American teen after calling police to report a suspicious person, and he said he shot Martin in self-defense. The case became a flash point in debates over racial profiling, and thousands attended vigils across the country over the weekend, decrying the verdict. Shawn Vincent, a spokesman for George Zimmerman's legal defense team, said when Zimmerman spoke with his attorneys on Friday, the car wreck didn't come up. The defense team, Vincent said, first heard of Zimmerman's involvement when media reports surfaced Monday. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: 911 callers describe smoke spewing from the vehicle after it flips .

"(CNN) -- ""Mr. Speaker, We are being slaughtered, we are being exterminated,"" cried out Vian Dakhil in a devastating appeal to the Iraqi parliament that deserves the attention of the entire world. Everyone should watch. The Iraqi legislator, a member of the country's Yazidi minority, collapsed at the end of her heartbreaking plea, imploring her country to stop the genocide of her people. ""In the name of humanity,"" she said, ""Save us! Save us!"" The Yazidis are caught in the brutal march of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, the extremist Jihadi organization. It has called itself the Islamic State, and has anointed itself the caliphate and its leader the ruler of all the world's Muslims. ISIS is carving a path of destruction as it sets its sights on imposing its rule, and its interpretation of Islam, on Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and beyond. In the process of achieving its military gains, ISIS is massing large caches of weaponry, taking over oil fields in Iraq, filling its coffers with cash and developing what could eventually become enormous military, economic and political power, if it is able to achieve its objectives. Preventing genocide, saving the Yazidis, is an imperative humanitarian goal in itself. But stopping ISIS, the al Qaeda offshoot that is too extreme even for al Qaeda, is important for preventing an even more disastrous turn in the boiling Middle East, and it is indispensable for global stability. It wasn't just Dakhil asking for help, and it's not only up to the dysfunctional Iraqi parliament to provide support. There is an important role for world powers -- for the United States -- in helping save the Middle East from one of the most ruthless and dangerous organizations operating today in one of the most important parts of the globe. Who is the ISIS? Iraq's Kurds, in the north of the country, are brave and determined. They love the United States, which twice helped them survive the genocidal efforts of Saddam Hussein. Their army, known as the Peshmerga (""those who confront death,"" in Kurdish), have been fighting against ISIS, but they are outgunned. That's partly because the Iraqi army dropped its (American) weapons and fled when ISIS rolled in from Syria and captured Mosul. The Kurds are prepared to challenge ISIS, and there is no one better to do it. They are moderate, pro-Western, committed to a multiethnic, religiously diverse Iraq and ready for the challenge. They have everything to gain from victory and everything to lose from defeat. America should help arm them. Skeptics have worried that by helping to stop the Sunnis of ISIS, the United States would be siding with Shiite Iran. But the Kurds are the perfect way to avoid that binary trap. Opponents of arming the Kurds also worry that it might add to the disintegration of Iraq. That is not necessarily the case. If Iraq survives, it should do so only as a federal state, in which Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds share power. If Iraq does not survive, and Iraqi Kurds at long last get a state of their own, it would hardly be a catastrophic outcome. The Kurds deserve a state as much as any other people, but they have been patient and loyal in helping Iraq survive. The Kurds, who lost hundreds of thousands of their people to Saddam Hussein's genocidal Anfal campaign, today deserve a chance to help save Iraq -- and themselves. ISIS is on the march, killing people, gleefully boasting about its savagery, while destroying ancient minority communities. Turkmen, Shabaks and Christians, in addition to Shiite Muslims, have endured the brutality of their new rulers. In Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, captured in June, Christians have been ordered to convert or face death. For the first time since the advent of Christianity, there are no Christians in Mosul. The fate of the Yazidis may be even worse. As Dakhil told the parliament, ""an entire religion is being exterminated from the face of the Earth."" She called it ""a campaign of genocide."" The chamber listened awkwardly as she described the plight of the ancient Yazidis, a religious minority that has faced discrimination and persecution over the centuries, but has managed to survive. Until now. Yazidis' religious beliefs are a combination of the Persian Zoroastrian faith, with elements of Islam and even Judaism. ISIS calls them ""devil worshipers."" The world now faces two urgent challenges: to prevent the genocide of the Yazidis and to stop ISIS from continuing to conquer swaths of the Middle East. Bombing ISIS positions would help save the Yazidis, but supporting the Kurds is key to success on both counts. Since taking over Mosul, not far from where most Yazidis live, ISIS has killed hundreds of Yazidi men. Women, as Dakhil said, ""are being taken as slaves and sold in the slave market."" Over the weekend, ISIS fighters launched a new offensive and pushed out the Kurdish Peshmerga who had protected the Yazidis. The Yazidi town of Sinjar fell to ISIS, and the population fled by the tens of thousands into the mountains, to escape the jihadists' cruelty. The displaced people can barely survive in their mountain hideout. UNICEF announced that 40 Yazidi children already have died. Huge numbers of Yazidis are surrounded by ISIS, with no water and no food. UNICEF estimates up to 25,000 of them are children in desperate need of assistance. Dakhil's cry was addressed to her fellow members of the Iraqi parliament, but the leader of the Yazidis extended a much wider appeal to world powers -- an appeal no less desperate for its dignified understatement. Under the heading ""Urgent distress call from the Prince Tahseen Said"" a letter addressed to Kurdish and Iraqi leaders, to the international community, and to Mr. Barack Obama, President of the United States. Prince Said, who described himself as leader of the world's Yazidis, explained that his people are peaceful, respect all religions, and have helped others in their hour of humanitarian need. Today, he said, ""they desperately need their brethren's help."" Come to the assistance of the Yazidi people, he asked, ""as soon as possible."" To ignore his plea would be to stand back and make way for genocide. We have been warned.","A tearful Iraqi lawmaker pleads for her people, the Yazidis, to be protected .

Similar to space showers, it works on a ""closed loop system:"" hot water falls from the tap to the drain and is instantly purified to drinking water standard and then pumped back out of the showerhead. As the process is quick, the water remains hot and only needs to be reheated very slightly. As a result, it saves more than 90% in water usage and 80% in energy every time you shower, while also producing water that is cleaner than your average tap. ""With my shower, which is constantly recycling water, you'd only use about five liters of water for a 10 minute shower ... In a regular shower you would use 150 liters of water -- 30 times as much. It's a lot of savings,"" explains Mahdjoubi. According to research carried out by his company, Orbital Systems, these savings translate to at least â‚¬1000 ($1351) off your energy bills each year. Mahdjoubi proposed the OrbSys shower while studying Industrial Design at the University of Lund in Sweden. His concept formed part of a collaborative project with NASA's Johnson Space Center, which looks to drive design concepts that could potentially assist space expeditions. ""In an extreme environment such as a space mission to Mars, design concepts are brought forward to use all of the possible resources to make it there and back. I don't see any reason why we can't be as efficient on Earth as we can be in space,"" he says. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 1.2 trillion gallons of water are used every year for showering in the United States alone. And yet, rather disturbingly, across the world more than three times the population of the States lacks access to any clean water at all. The concept of a water-saving shower is by no means a new one, but when CNN's Blueprint team caught up with Mahdjoubi at his offices in Malmo, southern Sweden, he explained that because it doesn't compromise on comfort, it's different to the rest. It has a higher than average water pressure and a very stable flow because, unlike conventional showers, it works independently from other appliances. This year, his showers were installed for the first time in Ribersborgs Kallbadhus, a coastal bathing house in Sweden. During the summer months more than 1000 bathers come and swim waters rich with plankton, algae and seaweed, before showering off. ""It's not just an exotic environment for application but it's an extreme field test because the showers are on pretty much constantly, for about 10 hours per day... and the feedback has been good."" At the bathing house, CNN introduced Mahdjoubi to Danish industrial designer Nille Juul- SÃ¸rensen, who recently designed Malmo's Triangeln train station. Juul- SÃ¸rensen was keen to talk about the wider potential of Mahdjoubi's design: ""My interest is not in the objects but in the system. There will be so many applications for this."" If deployed on a bigger scale, the purification technology developed for OrbSys could be used in taps and drinking fountains in the world's developing countries, where water-related illness is rife. ""Everybody should save as many resources as possible,"" says Mahdjoubi, ""but obviously these showers would be even more beneficial for people living in areas with water shortages. ""I want to get it to as many people as possible. That's the next step. It's not just about saving water. The motivation is to be smart about how we use our planet's resources.""","Swedish designer Mehrdad Mahdjoubi has developed a shower that recycles water .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian leaders reacted angrily Thursday to President Barack Obama's decision to slap further sanctions on Russian banks, energy firms and defense companies over Russia's actions in Ukraine. ""Sanctions are evil,"" said Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, as he warned that the steps taken by Washington and the European Union would lead to worsening relations -- and possible Russian retaliation. Russia's Foreign Ministry warned that it would not ""tolerate blackmail"" and reserved the right to take countermeasures, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin was similarly defiant, tweeting: ""The sanctions imposed by Washington on Russian defense sector majors are unlawful and demonstrate that the U.S. is engaged in unfair competition on the arms market. ""Anyway, the Americans cannot put a lid on the ongoing re-arming of the Russian armed forces or shatter the export potential of our defense sector."" As deadly violence continues to roil eastern Ukraine, European Union leaders also said they intended to increase sanctions, signaling growing Western concern about Russia's continued support for the separatists battling the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian jet 'shot down' Tensions between Ukraine and its larger neighbor showed no sign of easing Thursday, as Ukrainian officials reportedly accused a Russian fighter of shooting down a Ukrainian jet the previous evening while it was flying in Ukrainian airspace. ""A military plane of the Russian Armed Forces launched a missile strike against an Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which performed tasks on Ukrainian territory,"" Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council spokesman Andriy Lysenko was quoted as saying by the official Ukrinform news agency. ""Our plane was shot down,"" he said, adding that the pilot ejected and was picked up safely by Ukrainian forces. In response to the expanded sanctions, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk in Kiev had tough words for Russia. ""It is time to pay for violating the international law, military aggression, constant supply of weapons from Russia to the territory of Ukraine, financing militants who kill civilians and try to destroy Ukraine,"" he said. ""Russia will pay for the war it started against Ukraine."" The Pentagon said Wednesday that Russia now had 12,000 troops on the border with Ukraine, as well as some heavy weapons. The troop numbers had fallen to about 1,000 previously from a high of an estimated 40,000 forces earlier this year. Ukraine's government has accused Russia of allowing weapons and military equipment, including tanks, to cross the border illegally into the hands of pro-Russian separatists. Western officials have leveled the same charges at Moscow and urged it to act to ease the situation or face economic consequences and increased diplomatic isolation. Medvedev: We'll take measures in response . However, Moscow insists that the West's sanctions will only worsen the situation. ""They never bring success to those who implement them,"" Medvedev said of sanctions, as he addressed the government in remarks broadcast on Russia 24. ""So-called sectoral sanctions implemented by the United States unfortunately will lead to a growth of anti-American and anti-EU mood in Russia. We will come back to the 1980s. It's sad. If that's our partner's goal, then they achieved it."" Medvedev said Russia would have to look at its financing for defense and security measures in light of the pressure being put on it. ""If our partners carry on sanctions, we'll take measures against foreign companies and people in response,"" he warned. ""These sanctions won't help Ukraine."" His words echoed a warning by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday that the sanctions are already harming ties between his nation and the United States. ""They generally have a boomerang effect and, without a doubt, in this case, are driving the Russian-U.S. relations into a stalemate and seriously damaging them,"" he said, according to a Kremlin transcript of his remarks to reporters on a visit to Brazil. ""I am certain that this is harmful to the U.S. Administration and American people's long-term strategic national interests."" He accused the United States of pushing Ukrainian authorities toward a continued conflict, whereas Russia wants to see an immediate end to hostilities and a negotiated solution involving all sides, he said. Financing squeeze, assets freeze . Announcing the sanctions Wednesday at the White House, Obama said, ""We have to see concrete actions, and not just words that Russia in fact is committed to trying to end this conflict along the Russia-Ukraine border."" With the new sanctions, ""what we are expecting is that the Russian leadership will see once again that its actions in Ukraine have consequences, including a weakening economy and increasing diplomatic isolation,"" he said. The expanded U.S. measures target two Russian banks -- Gazprom Bank and VEB -- and two energy companies -- Novatek and Rosneft. They will not be able to get new medium- and long-term financing in the United States, senior administration officials told reporters in a conference call. In addition, the new sanctions freeze any U.S. assets and prohibit American business contacts for eight Russian arms companies that make weapons, including small arms, mortars and surface-to-air missiles. One of the eight is the Kalashnikov Concern, maker of the AK-47 assault rifle and other arms. Also on the list: Four Russian government officials, including the minister of Crimean affairs; the self-styled Luhansk People's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic leading the separatist campaign in eastern Ukraine; and Aleksandr Borodai, the self-declared ""Prime Minister"" of the Donetsk group. Targeting the separatist groups that simulate government structures prevents them from seeking financing, the senior administration officials noted. A statement published on the EU website Wednesday said the European Council would decide by the end of July on which entities and individuals to target with expanded sanctions over their actions in Ukraine. The council also asked the EU Commission to reassess EU-Russia cooperation programs, with a view to deciding, on a case-by-case basis, on suspending their implementation. ""The European Council urges the Russian Federation to actively use its influence over the illegally armed groups and to stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border, in order to achieve a rapid deescalation,"" the statement said. Earlier this year, the United States and Europe imposed a range of sanctions in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea this spring and massing of troops along Ukraine's eastern border. The earlier sanctions included asset freezes and travel bans. CNN's Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

"(CNN) -- For the second time in less than a week European football is facing up to allegations of match fixing. Estonian authorities announced on Monday 11 men have been charged with fixing 17 matches, including three matches in Europe's second-tier Europa League competition to the tune of 108,000 euros ($146,730). The Estonian Prosecutor's Office said two of the country's clubs, Narva Trans and Tallinna Kalev, purposefully recruited players who were open to manipulating matches. Of the 11 men charged, eight are players for Narva Trans or Tallinna Kalev, CNN was told by the prosecutor's office. The two teams are accused of looking for players from Estonia, Lithuania and Ukraine who were receptive to fixing aspects of matches in exchange for money. The news comes days after two men in Britain were charged with ""conspiracy to defraud bookmakers by influencing the course of football matches and placing bets thereon."" The three Europa League matches all involved Narva Trans and took place between June 2011 and July 2012. In addition to those three matches, the men are charged with manipulating 12 Estonian League fixtures, one Estonian Cup game and one match in Lithuania. All 17 of the matches took place between July 2011 and July 2012.","11 men charged with fixing football matches in Estonia .

"(Mental Floss) -- You can keep your Bluebeards and your Blackbeards. The most successful pirate of all time controlled a fleet of more than 1,500 ships and upwards of 80,000 sailors -- and she did it all without the help of facial hair. Tall ships like the La Boudeuse used to face threats from pirates as they sailed around the world. When a Chinese pirate captain named Cheng married a beautiful prostitute in 1801, he wasn't just getting the girl of his dreams; he was making the best financial investment of his career. His new bride, known to history as Cheng I Sao, or ""Wife of Cheng,"" agreed to the marriage on one condition -- that she would share equally in his power and would be given the opportunity to help him secure more wealth. Sounded like a deal to Cheng, and for the next six years, the husband and wife teamed up to grow their piracy business along the coast of the South China Sea, as far south as Malaysia. But then, in 1807, Cheng passed away. Instead of stepping aside like a ""proper"" widow, Cheng I Sao promptly took the reins. Thinking outside the treasure box . Although clearly ahead of her time, Cheng I Sao was shrewd enough to realize that the pirate masses weren't likely as enlightened. So, her first act as leader was to make her husband's second-in-command, Chang Pao, official captain of the fleet. While Chang Pao led the men into battle, Cheng I Sao focused her attention on business, military strategy, and the enormous task of governing a growing body of ruffians. In the years following her husband's death, she steadily brought more and more outlaws under the banner of her Red Flag Fleet. In fact, Cheng I Sao was eventually responsible for nearly all the piracy in the region and her fleet exceeded the size of many countries' navies. She also expanded the scope of the business, branching out from simple attack-and-pillage jobs to protection schemes, blackmail, and extortion. Cheng I Sao's reach also extended to the mainland, where she set up an extensive spy network and developed economic ties with farmers who would supply her men with food. If Cheng I Sao's business practices were exemplary, then her system of pirate law was nothing short of revolutionary. The code of conduct she wrote for her men prescribed much harsher punishments than previous pirate laws had. A disobeyed order was cause for beheading (as was stealing from the common plunder), and deserters stood to lose their ears. Ironically, Cheng I Sao's most famous laws applied to the taking of female prisoners. Ugly women were returned to shore, free of charge. Attractive captives were auctioned off to the crew, unless a pirate personally purchased the captive, in which case they were considered married. Of course, if that pirate cheated on his new bride, Cheng I Sao had him killed. The not-so-bitter end . Murder, thievery, and intricate crime syndicates will eventually garner the full attention of the law, and Cheng I Sao certainly had the authorities on her tail. But, here again, she proved more successful than her male counterparts. Cheng I Sao repelled attack after attack by both the Chinese navy and the many Portuguese and British bounty hunters brought in to help capture her. Then, in 1810, the Chinese government tried a different tactic -- they offered her universal pirate amnesty in exchange for peace. Cheng I Sao jumped at the opportunity and headed for the negotiating table. There, the pirate queen arranged what was, all told, a killer deal. Fewer than 400 of her men received any punishment, and a mere 126 were executed. The remaining pirates got to keep their booty and were offered military jobs. As for Cheng I Sao, she retired with her loot and her new husband (former righthand man, Chang Pao) and opened a gambling house. She died peacefully in 1844, a 69-year-old grandmother.

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday some U.S. wireless carriers implemented the first part of a national strategy to deter cell phone theft: a joint ""blacklist"" database of identifying information about cell phones reported lost or stolen. As of now, cell phone dealers are supposed check this database before honoring requests to reactivate allegedly ""locked-out"" phones, in order to prevent people from using stolen phones. It used to be that when you reported a phone lost or stolen, your carrier would suspend service to that device. But the person who stole your phone (or someone who bought it from the thief) could still walk into a cell phone dealer and get your phone reactivated under a new account. Chris Guttman-McCabe, vice president of regulatory affairs for CTIA (a global association of wireless carriers), explained: ""The point of the blacklist database is to dry up the aftermarket for stolen phones. If you can't reactivate a stolen phone, it's just a worthless hunk of plastic and metal."" The FCC first announced this PROTECT initiative in April to combat the theft of smartphones, tablets and the data they contain. Under this plan, U.S. carriers that use GSM network technology (that's AT&T and T-Mobile) committed to launching their databases by October 31. The other U.S. carriers, which operate CDMA-technology networks, still have over a year to get their lost/stolen phone databases up and running (by November 30, 2013). According to CTIA, Sprint/Nextel has already implemented its database. At first these CDMA databases will be carrier-specific; later the blacklists from all carriers will be integrated into a single database. Carriers which have launched their blacklist databases are now working to educate phone dealers on how to access them. It's likely that phone dealerships operated by carriers will follow this process -- but educating and gaining cooperation from independently operated phone retailers will be more challenging. Wireless carriers join forces to fight theft . ""This will take time,"" Guttman-McCabe acknowledged. ""I tend to see this as a glass half full. We're definitely making progress on fighting this problem, but it's not solved yet."" In the meantime, carriers are stepping up their efforts to get cell phone users to protect their devices. Public service announcements and other education efforts are under way to remind people to keep their cell phones and tablets locked with a password or PIN code. These carrier efforts include Web pages about phone security, mobile apps, e-mail information, bill inserts, and more. Some carriers such as AT&T and device manufacturers such as Apple offer a free ""remote wipe"" service -- allowing users to delete all data from a lost or stolen device to prevent data or identity theft. Other carriers charge for this service, and most mobile security vendors, such as Lookout or Norton, offer remote wipe as part of an annual subscription service package. It is possible to forcibly unlock a phone that is locked with a password or PIN, but this is considerably more difficult for thieves and could act as a deterrent. One factor slowing the implementation of a centralized cross-carrier database of lost or stolen phones is the uneven pace of LTE network rollouts across the U.S. Some of the identifying information listed in the database is derived from wireless networks, and variations in network technology make it difficult to create consistent and reliable listings for individual devices. So, while the carriers work to dry up the stolen phone aftermarket, take a moment to set up remote wipe service for your phone, remember to keep it locked, and beware of low-cost used phones available for sale on eBay, Craigslist, and elsewhere. If you purchase a device that turns out to be stolen and therefore can't activate it, you won't get your money back. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","U.S. wireless carriers implement a national strategy to deter cell phone theft .

"(CNN) -- Frank Korona lives near the West Virginia-Pennsylvania border with his wife Kathy, in a house that he built with his own hands, on the same property where he grew up. He served in the Army Special Forces in Vietnam. The Koronas have a long, proud tradition of military service, but their family's greatest losses have been to heart disease. ""Our family has shrunk tremendously. We've lost so many people through death,"" Kathy says. In 1992, Frank's brother Bob died in his arms, suffering a heart attack on their kitchen floor. Parents, siblings, aunts, uncles and cousins have all died from complications from heart disease, too. The Koronas point them out in a graveyard near their home. Frank and Kathy have both had heart attacks, and both have stents holding their blood vessels open. The birth of their grandson Caleb led them to try harder to extend their lives. So last year, the couple joined the Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease. Medicare, the government health insurance program for Americans 65 and older, covers the Ornish program, which teaches a plant-based, meatless diet, meditation and regular exercise. The program was officially declared an intensive cardiac rehab program in 2010, and the first patients started in May 2011. Ornish is a persistent advocate within the halls of government. There are mountains of scientific evidence that his recommended lifestyle changes do reverse heart disease, the No. 1 killer in the United States and worldwide. Helping patients make these lifestyle changes costs Medicare about $70 per hour, and patients can receive up to 72 one-hour sessions. Proponents of preventative medicine point out that that cost is still much less than operations and medications. Ornish believes that fear cannot motivate lifestyle change in people long-term. Change has to be about feeling better and having more zest for life. The greater the change, the better the feeling, he says. That seems to ring true for the Koronas. Despite the grim history of heart disease, they say it's how good they feel that keeps them living the lifestyle that their neighbors sometimes find strange. ""If I was going to be able to participate as a grandparent in his life, that gave me another incentive, that really did,"" Kathy explains. ""But in order to do that, I needed to feel good about myself first."" The Koronas' favorite yoga positions are ""cobra"" and ""fish,"" and their favorite pizza is meatless meat-lovers, made with soy pepperoni and soy ""ground beef."" ""Usually at the end of the session, the instructor will say, 'Now the reward, get into the total relaxation pose,' and we do that, and it just feels so good,"" Kathy says. Together the Koronas have lost 85 pounds on the program, and Frank is off of four medications. Hospitals can now bill Medicare for their patient's yoga and group discussion sessions because the Ornish program is an approved intensive cardiac rehab program, a new class of cardiac rehab created by Congress in 2009. Traditional cardiac rehab, developed in the 1950s and covered by Medicare since 1982, focuses almost exclusively on exercise -- getting patients out of bed and the blood flowing again. But in the 1970s, Ornish and others began leading experiments to test whether improving diet and stress levels could make a difference for those with heart disease. In the following decades the researchers published volumes of studies in peer-reviewed journals that became the basis of the Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease. There are four components to the program: nutrition, stress management, moderate exercise and group support. Part of the underlying cause for widespread heart disease, explains Ornish, is chronic loneliness and isolation, which lead to stress and bad habits. When people feel emotionally close to others, they're physiologically healthier, too, so Medicare is paying for it. ""The reason that I spent 16 years working with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to achieve Medicare coverage for our program is that I knew that most insurance companies follow Medicare's lead. In other words, if Medicare covered our program, most other insurance companies would, as well,"" explains Ornish, who also says he was once naive in thinking that solid science alone would be enough to change health care policy. ""Reimbursement as well as science are primary determinants of medical practice. If it's not reimbursable, it's not sustainable.""","Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease is covered by Medicare .

"(CNN) -- Pro-Russian separatists fired rockets at a Ukrainian military camp in eastern Ukraine before dawn Friday, killing at least 19 troops, a Ukrainian military spokesman said. The attack happened around 4:30 a.m. near the town of Zelenopolsk, in eastern Ukraine's restive Luhansk region, military spokesman Yuriy Stets said. At least 55 other people were injured, according to the nation's counterterrorism office. The office of President Petro Poroshenko, whose country has battled separatists in the east for months, accused attackers of using Russian-made Grad rockets against Ukrainian armed forces. ""Militants will pay hundreds of their lives for each life of our servicemen,"" Poroshenko said. ""Not a single terrorist will avoid responsibility; each of them will be punished."" The European Union is sanctioning 11 more people over the Ukraine crisis, the European Council said Friday, bringing the total number subject to EU visa bans and asset freezes because of the crisis to 72. The new names will be announced Saturday morning, the council said.

"(CNN) -- In one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in northern Tehran, a Japanese-inspired garden with mini-waterfalls welcomes potential buyers to a newly built luxury apartment. The four bedroom, four bathroom unit boasts marble floors, a state of the art open kitchen, computerized lighting systems and amenities that rival five star hotels. It's an apartment so posh visitors are required to wear sanitary shoe covers. With a market value close to $3.5 million, the need for guests to tread carefully is understandable. ""In my opinion it's worth it,"" says real estate agent Bahar Khalili. ""It's one of the best apartments in Tehran. An exceptional building designed by the best developer in the city."" But for the past year this swanky home has sat empty without a buyer -- half the other units in the six-floor block are empty, too. So are tens of thousands of other apartments throughout Tehran, all for sale but sitting vacant without buyers. ""Right now we have a lot of apartments that are not sold and sitting empty because of high prices,"" says Khalili. Housing prices in Tehran soared beginning in 2012, soon after western powers imposed the toughest round of economic sanctions against Iran to curb its disputed nuclear program. The sanctions were a huge blow to Iran's economy and when the value of Iranian currency took a nose dive and no one could figure out where the economy was going, many here poured their money into real estate. According to political analyst, Mohammad Ali Shabani, ""real estate became the best way to protect your money."" Khalili agrees with this sentiment. ""This is the safest investment you can make today,"" she said. ""Real estate has always increased in value. We have one apartment that's increased roughly $1,000 per square meter in the past five months. ""If someone wants to invest in Tehran and knows what he's buying, it's almost (a) certainty that's a good investment."" But with Iran's economic future still looking hard to predict and many Iranians lacking buying power, the market is at a standstill -- sellers not selling because they're hoping prices go up. Buyers are not buying because they're hoping prices go down. The outcome is a Tehran skyline full of empty apartments -- and investors still looking to buy and build despite very little demand. ""Sometimes you wonder how can people possibly build more apartments when nothing is selling,"" said Khalili. But remarkably, it's happening in Tehran because until the economy improves and housing prices start to stabilize, they believe, real estate is the safest place to invest.","Luxury apartments in Tehran are lying empty despite investors looking to buy .

"(Health.com) -- The makers of POM Wonderful pomegranate juice say that the drink improves blood flow and heart health, prevents and treats prostate cancer, and works 40 percent as well as Viagra (whatever that means). All for about four bucks a bottle. Those impressive claims helped the company rack up $91 million in sales in 2009. They also earned the disapproval of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Last month, the agency sued POM Wonderful for making ""false and unsubstantiated"" health claims, and is asking the company to remove the claims from its ads. A 100 percent juice drink that contains antioxidants (and no added sugar), POM is just one of many beverages that bill themselves as promoting better health. VitaminWater, kombucha tea, coconut water, and various brands of juice drinks made from acai, goji berry, and mangosteen have all used health claims in their marketing -- and some, like POM, have been the subject of scrutiny and legal action. The FTC, along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been cracking down on food and beverage makers for allegedly overselling the health benefits of their products. In 2009 alone, the FDA warned 17 companies that they were providing misleading nutritional information on their packaging or making overly specific health claims. Health.com: 25 diet-busting foods you should never eat . Not all of the products were drinks, but ""the beverage category stands out,"" says Bruce Silverglade, director of legal affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. ""At first blush it seems that beverage products are certainly a large proportion of food products that make bogus health-related claims."" Drinks such as POM have become increasingly popular with consumers in recent years, thanks in part to public health campaigns against soda that have been prompted by the obesity epidemic. ""The trend is away from traditional soda pop [toward] products claiming to provide magical health benefits,"" Silverglade says. Are the health claims true? Yes and no. The federal government doesn't require companies to vet health claims with the agency before plastering them on product packaging (as long as the claims are accompanied by a disclaimer about their uncertainty). But that doesn't mean the claims are invented -- most are based in research. The research is often funded by the manufacturers, however, and industry-funded research can be prone to bias. A 2007 study found that research on health drinks that was funded entirely by beverage companies was between four and eight times more likely to find a favorable result than research with no industry support. ""If a cell phone company told you they tested all the models and their model came out the best, would you believe it? Probably not,"" says Dr. Lenard Lesser, M.D., one of the co-authors of that study and a researcher at UCLA. ""The same is true with nutrition research, but the stakes are higher because we're putting our bodies at risk."" Where's the line between research and marketing? Sounds great, hard to believe . However far-fetched the claims may sound, POM is standing behind them. (Two weeks before the FTC publicly announced its lawsuit, POM preemptively sued the FTC, claiming that preapproval of ads featuring health claims violates the company's right to free speech.) But are shoppers really convinced that POM can unclog their arteries, cure cancer, and lead to hotter sex? There seem to be more than a few believers out there. "" I started drinking POM after reading the studies two years ago, my triglycerides were almost 1000!,"" one of POM Wonderful's 12,000 fans breathlessly posted on Facebook after the FTC announced its lawsuit. ""Working out everyday, drinking POM, and eating healthy, they are now less than 400. Forget what the Feds say! I believe!!!"" (A triglycerides level of 400 is still nearly three times higher than what's considered normal.) Most health beverage drinkers aren't as enthusiastic as the realtor from Alaska who posted the above testimonial. Quinton Ma, a 22-year-old marketing coordinator at Gawker Media, in New York City, started to drink VitaminWater as a middle schooler because it seemed like a healthy alternative to soda. ""I figured that if they were selling something that I could get extra vitamins from, it couldn't hurt to drink,"" Ma says. ""Once I learned they were really just cleverly marketed sugar waters, I stopped."" Health.com: You are what you drink . But the fact is, even when people don't buy the health claims they often still buy the beverage. That's the paradox of products such as POM, Silverglade says: The health claims on these products strain the imagination, yet studies have repeatedly shown that health claims sell food. That's because these claims -- however improbable they may seem -- distract shoppers from the real nutritional information and hook consumers with buzzwords like ""antioxidant."" This phenomenon is known as a ""health halo,"" an aura of healthfulness attached to a product based on labels like ""low-fat"" ""all-natural"" or ""made with whole grains"" that seduces consumers into overeating. According to a study by the FTC, this halo effect can even lead people to overlook warning statements -- about the high sodium content of a product, for example. ""A healthy halo develops around products like these,"" says Frances Largeman-Roth, R.D., Health magazine's senior food and nutrition editor. ""The health-conscious consumer incorporates them into their lifestyle, thinking that they're doing a world of good for themselves."" Health.com: Food label know-how: 5 mistakes even savvy shoppers make . Ceating a health halo . The makers of POM Wonderful have spent $34 million on scientific research on POM products and pomegranates. According to the FTC's complaint, the studies POM has funded do not substantiate the company's claims, and a closer look at the research seems to bear that out. One of the most prominent claims, that POM can decrease arterial plaque by 30 percent, was taken from a single pilot study that included just 19 people and was funded by the makers of POM.

""These days it's possible for a food company to pay just about anybody to conduct a study,"" says Silverglade. Michael Aviram, Ds.C., a cholesterol researcher at Rambam Medical Center, in Haifa, Israel, defended his studies on pomegranates -- many of them funded by POM -- by noting that they were published in ""very prestigious peer reviewed journals,"" including the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and Atherosclerosis. Dr. Harley Liker, M.D., a physician at UCLA Medical Center who has also led research funded by POM, directed all inquiries to a POM spokesman.

"(CNN) -- Svay Pak is a poor fishing village on the outskirt of Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, known globally as a destination for child sex. It's a place where mothers sell their own daughters to child traffickers, who supply them to brothels locally and across the country. But how has such a perverse trade been able to take root, let alone flourish here? Mark Capaldi, senior researcher for Ecpat International, an organization committed to combating the sexual exploitation of children, says several factors have made Cambodia a prime destination for child sex offenders. ""Insufficiently enforced laws, corruption, and the failure to address more overarching problems such as poverty and the negative side effects of globalization have made it a challenge for the country to shed the unenviable reputation as a destination for child sex,"" he says. The authors of a 2011 Ecpat International report identified a number of cultural and sociological factors that made Cambodian children ""particularly vulnerable to adult predators."" ""It has been observed that Cambodian children are indeed expected to abide by rules set forth by adults, and saying 'no' to an adult is not easily tolerated,"" reads the report. But what of the acceptance and willing participation of so many locals, including parents themselves, in the trade? For Don Brewster -- head of Agape International Missions, which aids Cambodian child survivors of the sex trade -- part of the answer as to why so many adults in Svay Pak are able to abnegate their parental duty to protect may lie in Cambodia's brutal recent past, which left behind a fractured society. ""What this country went through was unique in history,"" says Brewster, of the Khmer Rouge's systematic destruction of religious, educational and social structures -- not least of which the family unit -- during its genocidal 1975-79 reign. When Pol Pot's maniacal experiment ended, 2 million people were dead, and society's institutions almost erased. ""You lost your educated people and the system of educating them; you lost the moral compass that Buddhism provided,"" he says.","Corruption, poverty and a bloody past have made Cambodia a child sex trade hotspot .

"St Petersburg (CNN) -- St Petersburg has been a city of splendor for more than three centuries, and bears the name of the man who dreamt it all up: Tsar Peter the Great. But since Vladimir Putin took power in 2000, this city has been best known as the hometown of the president, and those in his inner circle who call the shots within the Kremlin and in business. Anna Scherbakova, bureau chief for the financial daily Vedomosti, said the power structure of ""Team Putin,"" is woven through with the city's elite. ""There are a lot of St Petersburg-born people in the Russian cabinet,"" she said. ""Also the CEOs of the Russian big monopolies like Gazprom, like Rosneft, like Sberbank."" In a symbol of the city's rising prominence, the state-run energy giant Gazprom will move its headquarters here next year at a cost of nearly $2 billion. The St Petersburg International Economic Forum, or SPIEF, is Putin's version of Davos. It is a showcase event for his administration and a chance for CEOs of the Global 100 to rub shoulders with those who matter most in this near $2 trillion economy. But it is obvious, with a long, long list of no shows from corporate America and Europe, the tone has changed dramatically for the worse at SPIEF 2014. According to Scherbakova, ""it could painful for the president's self esteem."" A year ago, the forum kicked off what was designed to be a smooth agenda of orchestrated events. German Chancellor Angela Merkel shared the stage with the president in a panel that I chaired. Tensions between them were obvious, but so too were overriding bilateral trade interests. A few months later, Putin talked of re-igniting growth as he hosted the G20 Summit in St Petersburg. In December, he moved to rescue Ukraine with a $15 billion bailout for his old ally, the now ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. Shortly thereafter, he was hosting the high-priced Sochi Winter Olympics. But it is Putin's annexation of Crimea and unrest in Eastern Ukraine which will define 2014 and very likely his legacy. Putin's popularity has skyrocketed at home, but that is weighed against economic isolation abroad. During the height of the Western-led banking crisis, Putin chided co-members of the G8 for their careless ways and lack of corporate governance. Today, the economic tide of growth has moved out on Russia. And that, according to Peter Truscott, former UK Energy Minister and Putin biographer, will force the Kremlin to take measured steps going forward. ""If a military conflict were to spread into Ukraine, against the background of further economic and trade sanctions, then I think Putin might lose support,"" Truscott said. ""That's why I think Russia is very wary of full military intervention in eastern and southern Ukraine at the moment."" In the spring of 2013, the Russian president promised protestors he would raise their standards of living by fostering investment. Having most U.S. and many European corporate leaders staying away from his annual gathering on the Neva River will not assist in the effort. And the event that was scheduled to round off the president's calendar on the global stage -- the G8 summit, due to be held during St Petersburg's long white nights -- has been canceled. Instead, there will only be the G7 in Brussels. READ MORE: The European Union needs a new vision . WATCH MORE: Is the EU out of its economic crisis?

"(CNN) -- After an 11-year-old girl was shot and killed by a stray bullet while sitting on a friend's bedroom floor, Chicago officials met Monday to discuss the city's recent surge in gun violence. The girl was just one of 47 shooting victims in Chicago over the weekend, five of which were fatal, according to statistics released by the Chicago Police Department. Shamiya Adams was brought to a nearby hospital in critical condition on Friday and pronounced dead Saturday morning, according to Anthony Brucci, a spokesman for Cook County Medical Examiner's Office. She was visiting a friend when a stray bullet from outside the residence struck her, according to Chicago Police Officer Jose Estrada. No other injuries were reported at that incident, and no one has been arrested or charged, Estrada said. An investigation is ongoing. ""Every morning, I wake up and I cry,"" the girl's mother told CNN affiliate WLS. ""I just can't believe it."" ""She used to tell me every day, give me a letter every day -- how much she loved me, how I was the best mother in the world,"" Shaneetha Goodloe said, her voice cracking with emotion. ""And I will never hear that again from her."" Asked what she would say to anyone who had anything to do with the child's death, Goodloe replied: Speak up. ""If you know anything, you should say something because this wasn't for her. This was not for my child. She was not supposed to die from a bullet to her brain,"" she said. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel met Monday with the Chicago Police superintendent and community leaders to discuss violence in their city, an event scheduled before the uptick in gun violence over the weekend. ""Our kids only get heard when there is a shot, be it a basketball shot or a bullet shot. There are other kids out there,"" Emanuel said at the meeting. ""Everybody says, 'So what are you going to do?' As if there's a single thing that's going to resolve this problem,"" Emanuel said. ""It is a communitywide problem, which requires a communitywide solution."" Blame weak gun laws for violence, Chicago's top cop says . Emanuel went on to say that public safety in Chicago goes beyond police and into investments in after-school and summer job programs, gun law enforcement and penalties and community building. The violent weekend in Chicago follows a deadly Independence Day weekend when more than 60 people were shot and nine were killed, according to police statistics. Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy blamed weak gun laws for the spurt of holiday violence. ""There has to come a tipping point where this changes,"" McCarthy said then of the violence. ""The illogical nature of what's happening here -- that government can intercede and prevent this from happening is overwhelming. And I refuse to think otherwise in a great country like America that we can continue to allow this to happen -- not just on a state, but on a federal level.""

"(CNN) -- Facing down a gunman, placing yourself in the path of flying bullets, forfeiting your life to protect innocents. It's a job description fitting for a soldier or police officer, but for a school teacher -- an elementary school teacher at that? What the teachers and principal at Sandy Hook Elementary School did for the children in their care could win a soldier in a war zone a Purple Heart. Read more: 'This world is a better place because she has been in it' But the soldier makes a conscious choice to face mortal danger when he or she enlists. Sandy Hook's heroes did not. Adam Lanza did not give them that choice when he opened fire in the hallway and two classrooms Friday in Newtown, Connecticut. Long before it happened, Principal Dawn Hochsprung tried to prevent a shooting -- or any other calamity -- by implementing new security measures at Sandy Hook. She made sure teachers practiced getting into lockdown mode. The front door was locked when the gunman arrived. A mother meeting with Hochsprung about her struggling child was astounded that the gunman had gotten in: ""It's a locked school; you have to be buzzed in,"" she later said. Principal's husband left with future that no longer makes sense . Lanza blasted his way in. Hochsprung heard the loud pop. She, school psychologist Mary Sherlach and Vice Principal Natalie Hammond went to investigate. They were acting as the first line of protection and paid heavily for it. Only Hammond returned from the hallway alive -- but not unscathed. Along with Hochsprung, 47, and Sherlach, 56, four teachers perished. Victoria Soto, 27, moved her first-grade students away from the classroom door. The gunman burst in and shot her, according to the father of a surviving student. Read more: Comforting survivors: 'Hug them' and 'cry with them' ""She would not hesitate to think to save anyone else before herself and especially children,"" her mother, Donna Soto, told CNN's Piers Morgan. Anne Marie Murphy's body was found in a classroom, slumped over young children killed in the shooting. The 52-year-old special education teacher was apparently attempting to shield them, her father told the newspaper Newsday. Aspirations were cut short and potential was wiped out -- of the young children who will no longer learn and grow toward adulthood, but also of the teachers who died. Rachel D'Avino, 29, was a behavioral therapist who worked with autistic children. D'Avino's boyfriend was going to propose to her on Christmas Eve. Lauren Rousseau, 30, had dreamed of being a teacher since before she went to kindergarten herself. She had been hired only last month by Sandy Hook and was substituting for a teacher on maternity leave when Lanza killed her. Read more: Remembering the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting victims . For the teachers who lived through the carnage, difficult tasks lie ahead. In the coming days, they will bury their colleagues and 20 small children they taught and adored, while comforting parents and nursing the tender hearts of the children who survived. Kindergarten teacher Janet Vollmer knows at least half of the killed children. ""Ten of them were in my class last year,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Sunday. ""It's tough. It's tough."" When the shots rang out, Vollmer locked her classroom door, covered the windows, including the one in the door, then took the children into a nook between bookcases and a wall. She read them a story to keep them calm. ""They kept saying 'How come we're here for so long?' 'Well, it will be a little longer.' "" she answered. ""When they're 5, you do whatever you can to keep them safe and keep them calm."" ""We're going to be safe,"" Vollmer told them, ""because we're sitting over here and we're all together."" Read more: Teacher: 'I wanted to be the last thing they heard, not the gunfire' First-grade teacher Kristen Roig herded her students into a bathroom, locked the door and told them not to make a peep. They got impatient, antsy, wanted someone to go out and see what was happening. No, she told them. She was afraid they would all die. ""If they started crying, I would take their face and tell them, 'It's going to be OK.' I wanted that to be the last thing they heard,"" she said, ""not the gunfire in the hall."" The wait dragged on, Vollmer said. ""Maybe it was 20 minutes, a half-hour; I'm not sure."" Police knocked at the door to take them all out. They instructed her to have the schoolchildren hold hands and close their eyes. ""At 5, it's not so easy to close your eyes and walk,"" Vollmer said. ""So I had them look toward the wall."" They all had to be brave. President Barack Obama eulogized the teachers in a speech to Newtown and the nation Sunday night. ""They responded as we all hope we might respond in such terrifying circumstances -- with courage and with love, giving their lives to protect the children in their care,"" he said. ""We know that there were other teachers who barricaded themselves inside classrooms, and kept steady through it all, and reassured their students by saying 'Wait for the good guys, they're coming'; 'Show me your smile.'"" Read more: What really makes schools safer? Now Newtown will need to muster the courage to rebuild, to keep raising the siblings of fallen angels, to face another day without a beloved child. Sandy Hook Elementary will probably move into another building, away from the scene of the spilled blood and bullet holes. Teachers and children will go back to class, prepare lessons, do homework, take tests and grade them. ""We need to get the kids back in school,"" Vollmer said. Vollmer, her colleagues and the children have all seen and heard too much and gotten through it bravely. Even soldiers experience permanent trauma after seeing a child being killed -- let alone 20 at once. --------- . The stories of how these teachers and school administrators risked their lives -- and in six instances gave them -- to protect their young students spurred CNN readers to label them heroes. ""The next time people criticize teachers, think of these heroes and know that any teacher would do the same for their students. Your children,"" wrote Tom in the online comment section below this story. ""How many dozen lives were likely saved because the teachers and administrators knew what to do?"" ""Let's try and remember these heroic women's names and forget the gunman's name starting today,"" said a person using the name druglady33. Margaret Kime called their actions ""Unimaginable grace when faced with unimaginable horror."" Commenter marsh025 suggested the school principal should have been armed and able to fight off the attacker: . ""She should have come out with guns blazing. (I never thought I would say that) At the very least, principals need to be armed and trained in locating and engaging gunmen who enter their schools. The principal and a security/police officer should go together, armed to confront the individual. This is what we've become."" ""We should never forget them,"" wrote boogbop, ""and we should make certain they did not die in vain by holding them up as an example of what is great and good in human beings.""","NEW: ""Remember these heroic women's names and forget the gunman's,"" a reader says .

"(CNN) -- Travel is meant to be a rich experience, a means of engaging with culture, cuisine and pleasure. In the last decade, cities around the world have helped this along by building exceptionally designed, clean, well-functioning airports. Along with them have come equally stunning airport lounges, and the super-luxe first-class areas in international hubs around the world are a testament to a new age of luxury. Instead of feeling like they're on the wrong side of a quarantine -- and serving decidedly lack-luster food (everyone's had a run-in with those dreaded airport ""panini"") -- these lounges are oases offering first-rate amenities, privacy and calm. It's all so good, in fact, you might even want to get to the airport early. Departures: The top villas in Tuscany .

"(CNN) -- A day after a New York guest house was pummeled online for its policy of fining wedding parties for negative online reviews, its owner has apologized.

Union Street Guest House owner Chris Wagoner admitted the fine was a company policy, but it isn't anymore. Although it had been removed from the website by Monday afternoon, screen shots show the policy read as follows: ""(T)here will be a $500 fine that will be deducted from your deposit for every negative review of USGH placed on any Internet site by anyone in your party and/or attending your wedding or event."" It was intended as a joke, ""never something I told employees to enforce,"" Wagoner wrote on the hotel's Facebook page. ""However, since it was listed on our website it did represent an official policy. I now realize this joke was made in poor taste and not at all funny. This is no longer a policy of Union Street Guest House and we have taken it off of our website.""

"(CNN) -- Less than three weeks after Young Jeezy turned himself in after allegedly beating up and threatening to kill his teenage son, the rapper has been arrested again. Alpharetta, Georgia, police spokesman George Gordon confirmed the new arrest to CNN but did not provide additional details Tuesday night. According to The Atlanta Journal Constitution, Jeezy -- whose real name is Jay Wayne Jenkins -- was arrested Tuesday afternoon and charged with obstruction for allegedly cursing at officers and refusing to provide his name. Gordon told CNN affiliate WSB that police arrived at an Alpharetta townhouse because of a security alarm, but no one answered the door. Police saw Jeezy walking out the back of the townhouse, and the rapper allegedly said the townhouse was his girlfriend's home. The Journal-Constitution said Jenkins refused to show his identification or give his name and instead cursed at officers, who then arrested him. All this comes less than three weeks after Jeezy, 36, turned himself after the alleged incident with his teenage son. His son told police the ordeal started at an Atlanta apartment in September 2012 after he sent a text message to his father. According to the son, Jeezy ""walked into the bathroom where he was and slammed his head against the sliding shower door,"" then ""picked him up and threw him into the wall in the bedroom,"" a police report said. When the teen tried to run downstairs and away, he was blocked by his father's bodyguard, the report said. Jeezy then ""pulled him back into the room, threw him on the bed, choked him and stated, 'I'll kill you,"" the son told police. He allegedly threw him against a wall and onto the floor before kicking him in the head. ""The juvenile stated his father stated to him 'I'll put a bullet in your head right now,'"" the report said. The boy's mother called police two days later when her son returned to her and she noticed bruising and scratches on his face, the police report said. A grand jury warrant was issued for the rapper, who faces charges of battery, terroristic threats and false imprisonment. Jeezy turned himself in to authorities January 3 and was released on a $45,000 bond, the Fulton County Sheriff's Office said. CNN's Dave Alsup and Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","Report: Jeezy was arrested after cursing at officers and refusing to identify himself .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- A prominent leader of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine resigned his post Thursday as fighting flared there, with militants reportedly downing a Ukrainian military plane. Alexander Borodai, prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, told reporters he was stepping down and handing over power to Alexander Zakharchenko, a little-known militia commander. As Ukrainian forces rapidly advance toward the key rebel-controlled city and Russia builds up forces along the border, the sudden resignation leaves a number of questions about the volatile region's future unanswered: What does it mean? Are militants disbanding and vanishing into the night? Is there a brutal battle ahead? Borodai, a Russian citizen who rose to power as pro-Russian rebels took portions of eastern Ukraine earlier this year, was a prominent public face for the separatists after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed last month. He gave little reason for his resignation Thursday, other than saying he considered the job of founding the republic to be finished and that it was time for a Ukrainian to take the reins. The announcement came after days of assault on rebel positions near Donetsk by Ukrainian forces. Shelling in the Donetsk area, which could be heard periodically in and around the city, killed four civilians and injured 18 others on Thursday, local officials said. About 25 miles to the northeast, rebels shot down a Ukrainian MiG-29 near the town of Yenakievo on Thursday evening, Ukrainian military spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov said. Initial information indicates that a missile from a Russian-made surface-to-air antiaircraft system, called Buk or SA-11, shot the plane, Seleznyov said. Information about the fate of the pilot wasn't immediately available. That's the same type of missile system that U.S. and Ukrainian officials have alleged downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine last month, killing all 298 people on board. U.S. officials have concluded the missile was fired from rebel-held territory. Rebel leaders and Russia, which Western nations have accused of supplying the rebels in the months-long fighting, deny involvement. The ongoing fighting has killed close to 1,400 people -- civilians and combatants -- and more than 4,000 people have been wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April, according to U.N. officials. The battles also have forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes and seek shelter either elsewhere in Ukraine or across the border in Russia. NATO warns Russia . NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned Russia Thursday that any further intervention in Ukraine ""would lead to further isolation"" and ""deeper, more profound, tougher economic sanctions that would really hurt the Russian economy."" Rasmussen told reporters in Kiev he hopes that Russia, which according to NATO has 20,000 troops along the border with Ukraine, ""steps back because it wouldn't be in Russia's interest to intervene further."" Russia has denied allegations that it's supporting separatists in Ukraine and maintains that it wants to see a diplomatic solution to the crisis. But U.S. and Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of saying one thing while doing another -- building up troops along the border and continuing to send support to pro-Russian separatists. MH17 search efforts halted . The fighting also prompted an international team of experts, led by the Netherlands, to suspend its efforts to search the MH17 debris sites for remaining human remains amid fierce fighting in the area. The experts said the area wasn't safe to search, citing intensified battles in the area. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters Wednesday that search teams plan to return to the plane crash site. But he didn't give a date for when that might happen. ""We have done what we could do in the current conditions,"" Rutte said. ""Everyone will agree with us that we should not expose our people to unnecessary risk."" Ukraine's government said Thursday that it was scrapping a cease-fire around the crash site -- put in place to enable the team's work -- until their mission restarts. In a statement on the Cabinet website, it accused the rebels of provocations and of putting the experts' lives at risk. The statement from Ukraine's Cabinet said at least three more zones where debris lies scattered remain unexamined. The experts plan to discuss when the next stage of the search operation might begin shortly, it said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- ""Django Unchained"" actress Daniele Watts defended her refusal to show her ID to Los Angeles police before they handcuffed her last week. The African-American actress and her white boyfriend accused police of racism for questioning them in what they said was only a public display of affection. ""I believe in America and what it stands for,"" Watts said Monday in an interview on CNN's ""New Day."" Police responded to a citizen complaint that ""a male white and female black were involved in a sexual act inside a Mercedes"" outside the gate of CBS Studio Center on Thursday, according to a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department. Legal experts said the officer had the right to request identification if he suspected illegal behavior, but audio of part of the encounter with police, published by TMZ, revealed that Watts did not believe so. ""Somebody called, which gives me the right to be here,"" the unidentified Los Angeles police officer is heard saying to Watts. ""So It gives me the right to identify you by law."" ""Do you know how many times the cops have been called just for being black?"" she responded. ""Who brought up the race card?"" the officer said. ""I'm bringing it up because I have every right to be here,"" Watts said. When the officer again asked for her ID, the actress responded, ""You can take me down to the court office, and I can make a scene about it. And you know what? I have a publicist, and I work as an actor in this studio."" The officer, who patrols a neighborhood home to many A-list celebs, including George Clooney and Miley Cyrus, seemed unmoved by the prospect. ""I'm mildly interested you have a publicist, but I'm going to get your ID,"" he told her. ""No, I'm going to say no, and if you'd like my ID you can say that I'm resisting arrest,"" she said. ""There's no resisting, you're just interfering,"" he said. ""I have probable cause; we received a radio call."" Watts called her father. ""I can't make out with my boyfriend in front of my f--king studio?"" she is heard yelling to her father. ""I don't have to give him my ID because it's my right to sit on the f--king street corner and make out with my boyfriend. That's my right."" ""Keep yelling, it really helps,"" the officer then said. Watts was eventually handcuffed and placed in a patrol car. She was released a few minutes later when her boyfriend relented and gave the officer her ID. A Los Angeles police representative told CNN on Sunday that officers from its North Hollywood precinct were responding to a citizen complaint. ""There was an indication on the radio call that a male white and female black were involved in a sexual act inside a Mercedes with the vehicle door open,"" Officer Sally Madera said. ""Two people were briefly detained, but it was revealed no crime had been committed."" Watts' boyfriend -- Brian James Lucas, better known as celebrity chef Cheffy Be*Live -- wrote in a Facebook post that police ""saw a tatted RAWKer white boy and a hot bootie shorted black girl and thought we were a HO (prostitute) & a TRICK (client)."" The couple posted a short video clip and several photos showing Watts in handcuffs talking to police. One image shows a cut on her wrist, which she said was caused by the tight handcuffs. Watts, who acts in the FX show ""Partners,"" said the officers ""accosted me and forced me into handcuffs"" after she refused ""to agree that I had done something wrong by showing affection, fully clothed, in a public place."" Lucas said when an officer asked for their identifications, he showed his that but Watts refused ""to give it because they had no right to do so."" ""So they handcuffed her and threw her roughly into the back of the cop car until they could figure out who she was,"" he wrote. ""In the process of handcuffing her, they cut her wrist, which was truly NOT COOL!!!"" She was released ""quite quickly when they realized we were right outside CBS and that she was a celebrity and I was a celeb chef,"" Lucas wrote. ""Before they figured out who she was they were threatening calling an ambulance and drugging her for being psychologically unstable, SO NOT COOL WHATSOEVER! "" Watts and Lucas said they initially decided to forget about the incident, but then they decided they needed to speak up. ""We still forgive, love and bless them ... just not putting up with this for our own freedom and heart space,"" Lucas wrote. The couple has contacted lawyers, the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP, he said. ""Our publicist has us in contact with media about it, too, and we're supposed to hear back."" The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed it is conducting an internal investigation.

"(CNN) -- The British couple arrested in Spain after pulling their cancer-stricken son out of a Southampton Hospital told a judge they will not return to the UK voluntarily, according to a Madrid court where they appeared on Monday. Brett and Naghmeh King remain in a Spanish prison while the judge awaits information from a hospital in Malaga about the medical status of 5-year-old Ashya King, who has brain cancer. His parents can be detained for 72 hours in Spain before the judge has to decide whether they acted illegally when they defied doctors last week, took their son and sparked an international search for the child. Hotel staff members in Malaga, Spain, recognized Ashya and his family from media coverage and contacted police. Ashya was taken to Materno Infantil Hospital in Spain, and that facility was communicating with University Hospital Southampton, where the boy had been removed by his parents, hospital official said. Brett King defended his actions in a YouTube video made shortly before his arrest. He accuses two doctors at the British hospital for not allowing him to seek proton beam treatment outside of Britain, even though he said he was ready to pay for the treatment himself. ""We pleaded with them for proton beam treatment. They looked at me straight in the face and said with his cancer, which is called medulloblastoma, it would have no benefit whatsoever."" King said he then looked on the Internet and found sites in the United States, France and Switzerland on proton beam treatment that ""said the opposite that it would be beneficial for him."" The Kings traveled to Malaga with their six children to sell a home they own there, in order to ""look for better treatment"" for Ashya, said their Spanish lawyer, Juan Isidro Fernandez. The hospital in Southampton issued a statement saying they discussed proton beam radiotherapy with Ashya's parents. ""We very much regret that the communication and relationship with the King family had broken down in this way and that for whatever reason they have lost confidence in us,"" said Dr. Michael Marsh, medical director at University Hospital Southampton. ""Our first concern is for Ashya's welfare"" Marsh said some tumors respond well to proton beam treatment, but ""there are some cases where there isn't the evidence that this is a beneficial treatment,"" he said. The hospital statement did not give specifics about Ashya's case. The 5-year-old's ordeal has captured the attention of British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""I think people up and down the country will understand and be moved by the grave illness from which Ashya is suffering. The priority must be that he receives the most appropriate care,"" the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. Ashya's brother Naveed posted a video on YouTube explaining how the family cared for the sick child while traveling to Spain. ""This video shows information that would help in court to show that Ashya was not neglected whilst not in Hospital,"" the video caption reads. Only if the Spanish judge decides that the King's acted illegally can the process of extraditing them back to the United Kingdom begin, court officials said. In the United States, only a handful of hospitals offer proton-beam therapy after surgery, including Massachusetts General Hospital, where the late U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy was treated for brain cancer in 2008. He died just a year after his surgery for malignant glioma. That surgery was followed by six weeks of radiation. Kennedy wrote about his experience in a Newsweek magazine article at the time that he underwent proton-beam therapy. The theory behind proton therapy is that its high-energy particles zone in specifically on the tumor and so do not harm the surrounding healthy tissue as much as the X-ray photons in conventional therapy, said Dr. Donald O'Rourke, associate professor of neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. CNN's Joyce Joseph and Taylor Phillip contributed to this story .","Parents who took son with brain cancer to Spain refuse to return to UK voluntarily, court says .

"(CNN) -- You have your assignment, you've gathered your elements. Now what? It's time to put your story together. As a CNN All-Platform Journalist, it's my responsibility to research stories and follow news events in a specific region. I am stationed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and cover both local and long-distance assignments. This unique, hybrid position is a combination of field and package producing, writing for television, shooting video and still photos, plus off-air or on-air reporting. In essence, an APJ is a reporter, correspondent, producer and video editor in one. Otherwise known as a one-woman band. Below are essential tips to keep in mind when out in the field. Choosing a story: Although not all stories make for good multimedia production, the best multimedia stories are multidimensional. And that means there is enough action for video, strong emotions for still photographs and compelling sources for text to help better explain the topic. Finding the angle: The key to a successful story is uncovering the reason audiences should care about it. When thinking about the story, ask yourself ""So what?"" or ""Who cares?"" Answering these questions will ultimately tell your story. Without an angle, without a reason for what you're covering, you're just left with moving pictures or words on a page. Storyboarding: Before you head out the door, allow for some time to create a rough sketch of how to organize a story and a list of its contents. Determine what the story is about, who can explain the subject matter and how the story will look. Doing so will help focus and define the parameters of the story. Think of this as the directions for the recipe to your favorite casserole -- it tells you how to put the story together. Shoot to edit: Regardless of your deadline, you want to shoot video and stills, or gather audio, of exactly what you need for your story. You do this so that when its time to edit, you will spend less time looking for what you need. When you have more time to work on a story, shoot multiple takes of the same subject for editing variety and for a more creative and narrative approach to the story. The basics for your story should include the subject, and any other elements that help explain the story, externals of a building, streets, the scene of an accident, etc. Allow for silences; don't interrupt: This advice from mastering the art of interviewing also holds true for when it comes to doing on-camera interviews. Most people need some time to grapple with their thoughts and formulate responses. It's on you to give them that space. And when you're editing video, the last thing you want is to hear yourself on camera interrupting your subject. Respond with gestures and pause between questions. You want clear in and outs to sound-bites so you can more easily edit your package. Pulling it together: It's important for you to decide the parts of a story, the flow of a story, and what's most important in each section of your story. Even the most seasoned journalists must be reminded that every good story has a beginning, middle and end. Edit, edit, edit: You may love everything you've written, everything you've shot and everything else about your story. Heck, you may even love yourself for the great work you did. Now cut the fat. Pick out the strongest quotes and the strongest visuals. Tell the story, don't be the story: It is your job to cover an event or profile an individual. Not become the story. This means, stay out of the way. There will be times you may want to shoot a standup because it helps move a complicated story along, or you may need to track a package because there is a lot of information that needs to be conveyed. That's all part of the job. What's not part of the job is making the story about you. Don't force it: Let the story dictate your approach. If the video is limited or if the subject isn't compelling, move on. Some stories aren't easy to tell visually, but work well in print. If that's the case, do that. Just because you don't have video doesn't mean you failed. Interestingly enough, people will tolerate bad video, but they will not forgive poor audio. Have fun: This one's a no-brainer. If you're not loving what you're doing, stop. Ready to give this a try? Here's your challenge: Put all your boot camp knowledge to the test and create a can't-miss report about a local landmark where you live.

"(CNN) -- It's been six years -- 2007, if you're into counting numbers -- since the once sleepy fishing port of Macau surpassed Las Vegas as the world leader in gambling revenue. We love the flash. And the occasional winning night at the tables. But there's a slower side to this city of just less than 600,000 residents, one of cobblestone lanes, colonial mansions, art deco buildings and tranquil parks, all done in a fusion of Chinese and Portuguese motifs. The best part is that Macau (just an hour from Hong Kong by ferry) is compact, making it a breeze to explore. Here's a primer. 1. Baccarat is the game of choice . Macau is the gambling capital of the world. By far the most popular game is baccarat, a relatively simple game with a low house advantage (less than 1%). Baccarat tables dominate the city's 33 casinos. There are plenty of slot machines as well, but they offer a high house advantage and aren't popular. This is the reverse of Las Vegas where gamblers favor slots. Macau's revenue from gambling is $33 billion, more than five times that of the Las Vegas Strip. Tycoon Stanley Ho's 40-year reign as the city's casino kingpin came to an end in 2002 when the Macau government ended the monopoly system. Today, there are six casino operators: SJM Holdings (Stanley Ho), Wynn Macau, Sands China, Galaxy Entertainment Group, MGM China Holdings and Melco Crown Entertainment. 2. Macau was the first and last European colony in China . The Portuguese settled in Macau in the 16th century and the island was handed back to China in 1999. Today, Macau is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) -- as is Hong Kong -- and is governed under the ""one country, two systems"" principal, which was the brainchild of late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Although no longer a colony, Portuguese is still an official language and the Portuguese influence can be seen everywhere from blue tiled street signs to tiled floors and beautiful gardens.

Macau has the world's highest population density with 20,497 people per square kilometer. No surprise then that it needed to do something dramatic to make room for new casinos and 30 million visitors that come every year. The solution was a massive land reclamation project that joined the two islands south of the mainland -- Coloane and Taipa. This gave Macau an extra 5.2 square kilometers to create a gambling mecca to rival Las Vegas. It's known as the Cotai Strip -- drawing on the names of the two islands, Coloane and Taipa. The Venetian Resort, City of Dreams, Sands Cotai and Galaxy Macau Resort are all on the Cotai Strip. There's another big one on the way -- Steve Wynn is spending $4 billion on a huge resort called Wynn Palace set to open in 2016. 4. Coloane is still chill . The most southern island, Coloane, remains wonderfully untouched by the casino craziness. This is largely due to strict rules over title deeds that make it difficult to buy property on the island. The low-rise houses and quiet tree-lined streets that give Coloane its charm remain as they have for decades. Coloane is home to Lord Stow's Bakery, birthplace of Macau's much-loved egg tart. Not too sweet, these tarts with their crispy pastry are worth queuing for. Another Coloane favourite is Fernando's. Like the rest of Coloane, it's super laid-back and the food is reliably good. The garlic prawns and suckling pig are must orders. More: Insider Guide: Best of Macau . 5. Heritage is here to stay . Before the big casino operators rolled into town the Macau government did something clever -- it applied to UNESCO for World Heritage status. In 2005, the historic center of Macau was put on the list. The city's historic monuments are one of the city's biggest draws, a wonderful example of the early encounter between Chinese and European civilizations. The old heart of the city is small and a walking tour can easily take in the key sites from the iconic Senado Square, the Ruins of St. Pauls, the beautiful churches and temples and the old city wall. Most of the sites are open daily and free to visit. 6. Macanese cuisine is fusion food . Macanese cuisine is unique to Macau and combines the best of Chinese and Portuguese ingredients and cooking along with influences from Brazil, Goa and other former Portuguese colonies. There's plenty of seafood -- codfish, sardines, crab -- as well as rabbit, duck and chicken. Portuguese influence is seen in the flavoring, with plenty of turmeric, cinnamon, chili and coconut. Dishes are often baked or roasted for a long time to allow the flavors and spices to develop. Macau's caldo verde soup is a popular starter and is similar to the Portuguese original, but uses bok choy instead of collard greens. The national dish is minchi -- minced beef or pork cooked with potatoes, onions, soy sauce and sometimes an egg. 7. Broken Tooth is out and about . He was once Asia's most feared gangster, the leader of the 14K triads, and after 13 years behind bars he's now a free man. Wan Kuok-koi was born in Macau's slums and worked his way up triads. Along the way he broke several teeth in street fights and earned his nickname. As head of the largest triad society in Macau, he and his crew waged a violent turf war against a rival gang, the Shui Fong, in the years running up to the 1999 handover. It was a time of drive-by shootings and car bombs that came to an end only when he was jailed in 1999. Broken Tooth must have had a shock when he was released in December last year. Macau changed dramatically while he was in prison and the swathe of new monster casinos has totally transformed the city. Today, the triads have almost total control of the junket operators and keep a low profile. 8. It's a city of longevity . People in Macau live a long time -- an average of 84.4 years. Macau takes second place in global life expectancy. Only the residents of Monaco -- ironically another place beginning with the letter ""M"" that's known for its casinos -- live longer (89.6 years). The fantastic economy is thought to have a lot to do with the great life expectancy. This year Macau was named the world's second fastest growing economy (after Mongolia) and more than 50% of Macau's revenue comes from gambling. So while the chain-smoking high rollers might be knocking off years with stressful, risky gambles, the locals are almost guaranteed their golden years. More: 40 Hong Kong dishes we can't live without . 9. One in five locals work in a casino . Macau's casinos employ 20% of the population. When a casino takes on new staff, it checks to see if he or she has family working in the casino and in which section, to avoid the possibility of fraud. Locals rarely visit the casinos to gamble and government employees are forbidden from gambling here. The overwhelming majority of gamblers are from mainland China and Hong Kong. New regulations brought in early this year means that 50% of a casino floor must be non-smoking. The massive open plan Venetian Macau -- the largest casino floor in the world -- uses a smart ventilation system that creates areas of low and high pressure to ensure that the smoke is drawn up into air vents. 10. The beach has black sand . Hac Sa Beach -- which translates as ""Black Sand Bay"" -- is Macau's largest natural beach. It's on the southeast side of Coloane Island. The beach is a kilometer long and famous for its black sand. It gets its unique color from minerals in the seabed that are washed ashore. The sand isn't as black as it used to be. Erosion was gradually chipping away at the beach so the government decided to top up the beach, but the replacement sand is yellow, which has muted the dark sand. More: World's 100 best beaches .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China on Thursday unveiled the elite group of leaders who will set the agenda for the country for the next decade, the culmination of months of secretive bargaining and a carefully choreographed performance of political pomp. The seven members of the powerful committee that sits atop the Chinese system strode out onto a stage in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. They were led by Xi Jinping, who takes over from Hu Jintao as head of the Communist Party, which has ruled China for more than 60 years. Xi is joined on the new Politburo Standing Committee, the party's top decision-making body, by Li Keqiang, who is expected to replace Wen Jiabao as premier early next year, and five other veteran party officials. Although the committee's lineup is new, analysts said it appeared to be predominantly conservative and unlikely to bring about meaningful political changes in the world's most populous nation and second largest economy. China's new leaders: Who's who . Xi also succeeded Hu as head of China's powerful Central Military Commission, which oversees major national security and military affairs. That makes for a cleaner transition than in the past two power handovers, when the former party chiefs held onto the key military role for years afterward, using it to keep exercising considerable power and influence. A far cry from the relentless media campaigns and frequent public appearances of U.S. presidential candidates, the efforts to determine who ended up in China's most powerful posts have taken place behind closed doors, part of a once-in-a-decade leadership transition. The focal point of the process has been the party's 18th National Congress that has unfolded amid heavy security in Beijing over the past week. Shadow of former president looms over China's new leaders . Despite the spectacular economic and social changes China has undergone in recent times, the party has maintained a tight grip on power and upheld its obscure methods for selecting its top leaders. The consequences of the leadership handover are significant for the nation's 1.3 billion citizens, its neighbors in Asia and the United States, which is warily watching China's economic and military rise. Standing in front of a huge landscape painting on Thursday, Xi brought a touch of cordiality to the start of his speech before a packed room of reporters, apologetically acknowledging that he and his party colleagues had kept their audience waiting by appearing later than scheduled. But he quickly turned to serious matters, warning of the ""many severe challenges"" that the party faces. He singled out corruption, remoteness from the general public, as well as undue emphasis on formalities and bureaucracy as particular concerns. Experts detail 5 challenges for China . The secrecy and exclusivity of the procedure by which China's top leaders are selected, involving maneuvering and deal-making among senior party figures, leaves a lot of the country's citizens feeling detached from the process. ""Many ordinary people don't feel so excited or joyful about what's happening,"" said Lijia Zhang, a Beijing-based author. ""People say, 'Oh, it's the party's business, nothing to do with us -- and we do not have a say in selecting the leader or the policy.' "" But Xi's speech had more of a human touch than many of those delivered by Chinese officials, and he addressed subjects close to the heart of many Chinese people and others around the world. ""Our people have great enthusiasm in life,"" he said. ""They hope for better education, more stable jobs, more satisfactory income, more reliable social security, medical services with higher standards, more comfortable living conditions and a more beautiful environment."" What kind of changes Xi, 59, and those joining him on the party's most powerful committee are likely to usher in over the coming years remains shrouded in mystery. ""Xi Jinping is in many ways an unknown commodity,"" said Mike Chinoy, a former CNN correspondent and now a senior fellow at the University of Southern California's U.S.-China Institute. ""He's risen to the top of the Chinese system by being very careful not to disclose what he really thinks."" The son of one of Mao Zedong's top lieutenants, Xi is considered a ""princeling"" because of his family's place in the Communist Party aristocracy. He is also believed to be close to the Chinese military. Married to a popular folk singer for the People's Liberation Army, he has climbed through the party hierarchy, at one point holding the top job in the eastern metropolis of Shanghai. He is expected to inherit the title of president from Hu, 69, early next year. Some observers have expressed hope that the next decade could bring a degree of political reform as Chinese leaders seek to bolster their legitimacy, which has been eroded by widespread corruption and the dramatic scandal this year involving the former senior party official Bo Xilai. China's young talent: To stay or to go? But many analysts are skeptical about the willingness of leaders to adopt significant changes, noting the concentration of power and money at the top of the party. The new set of leaders appears set to uphold the status quo, according to Willy Lam, a history professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""By and large, we have a conservative team,"" Lam said following the announcement of the new Standing Committee. ""We can expect no substantial or meaningful movement toward political reform."" The new leaders are likely to be ""in favor of staying the course, maintaining political stability and defusing challenges to the party's authority,"" he said. The new Standing Committee is more streamlined than its previous incarnation, dropping for nine members to seven. The smaller committee may help bring about greater unity and efficiency at the top of the party, some experts say. Besides Xi and Li, the members of the elite committee are Zhang Dejiang, Yu Zhengsheng, Liu Yunshan, Wang Qishan and Zhang Gaoli. The new lineup shows that Jiang Zemin, the 86-year-old former party chief who preceded Hu, still maintains heavy clout in the Communist hierarchy, said Cheng Li, director of research at the John L. Thornton Center at the Brookings Institution. The composition of the committee is ""not a surprise but a disappointment,"" he said, adding that it was dominated by people loyal to Jiang. He said some Chinese people would be disappointed about the decision not to include Liu Yuanchao and Wang Yang, senior officials who he described as ""strong advocates for political reform."" Blind Chinese dissident's family bears scars . The next chance to refresh the Standing Committee's membership will occur in five years, when the Communist Party's next National Congress takes place. For the time being, the committee remains a men's club with no woman among its new members. Since the Standing Committee's creation in 1949, no woman has ever held a position on it. Despite speculation that Liu Yandong, the lone female member of the wider Politburo, might be tapped for the elite group, she was not among the seven members who marched across the stage Thursday. Her age may have been a disadvantage in her candidacy, according to the Hoover Institution, which is based at Stanford University. Liu was born in 1945 and has been a member of the Politburo since 2007. Women lag in political representation in China. Only 2.2% of working women were in charge of the state offices, party organizations and other enterprises or institutions, according to the Third Survey on Chinese Women's Social Status, a national survey released last year. The number of women on the 25-member Politburo has increased, though, from one to two: Sun Chunlan, the party secretary of Fujian province, joins Liu, who was already a member. The reaction from China's neighbors to the unveiling of the new leadership reflected its complicated relationships in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan, which is locked in a tense territorial dispute with China over a group of small islands in the East China Sea, said it hoped ""the mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interest will be further developed and enhanced with the new leadership."" Kim Jong Un, the young leader of North Korea, sent a message congratulating Xi on his new position, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. Kim's message stressed the long ""friendship"" between the two countries. China is the reclusive North Korean regime's main ally, providing it with vital economic support. N.

"(CNN) -- A Ukrainian journalist detained Tuesday by pro-Russian rebels while working as a freelance producer for CNN has been freed. Anton Skiba called CNN on Saturday to confirm his release. CNN also received visual confirmation that Skiba is free from sources on the ground in Donetsk. On Tuesday evening, armed fighters led by a senior official from the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic were waiting outside the Donbass Palace Hotel, in the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk, as CNN television crew returned from a day's work at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Skiba had worked for one day with the CNN crew when he was detained. Skiba's work as a journalist for CNN also encompassed translating and providing local knowledge. An official with the Donetsk People's Republic initially accused Skiba of ""terrorism"" and of posting offers, on his Facebook page, of cash rewards for the killing of rebel fighters. The official later dropped the accusation about the Facebook posts and said Skiba was being questioned for having multiple forms of identification with different surnames.

"(CNN) -- Rain began falling on the Big Island Thursday afternoon and the winds began to pick up as Hurricane Iselle zeroed in on Hawaii. The outer bands of the storm reached the eastern part of the island, bringing wind gusts as fast as 65 mph. By Thursday, the shelves of many supermarkets were swept bare. Schools and government offices closed. Sandbags were being filled and placed around homes and hotels. Ports were told to close. In Hawaii County, where there is a hurricane warning, 630 people have gone to shelters, Mayor Billy Kenoi told CNN affiliate KHON. Gwendolyn Hill, who operates a bicycle tour on the island, said she normally goes to the store at 5:30 a.m. and is usually the only one there. Not this time. ""People were buying water, rice, toilet paper and Spam,"" she said. ""I don't eat Spam but a lot of people here do and it was going fast."" She said she thought her family was prepared for the storm. They got out the camping gear and had food and water for a week in case the power went out. ""The power goes out fairly often here on the Big Island, so losing power is not really a big deal,"" she said. Track the storm . The shoppers were preparing for a potentially devastating one-two tropical cyclone punch, starting with Hurricane Iselle, with winds of 75 mph, and Hurricane Julio, a Category 3 storm, about 900 miles behind it. Iselle could bring up to 12 inches of rain, life-threatening storm surges, flash floods and mudslides, forecasters said. They predicted Iselle will weaken somewhat and potentially make landfall late Thursday as a strong tropical storm. Hurricane Julio, churning behind Iselle, could affect the islands two days later, though forecasters expect it to brush the state only with its southern outer bands as it passes to the north as a weakened tropical storm. Customers picked through stores for groceries and other supplies Wednesday night and Thursday morning. At many locations, such as KTA in Waimea, bottled water was sold out, leaving the seller scrambling to get more. ""We've been on the phone from very early (Wednesday) morning, working with our vendors trying to get more water. It's been a very difficult situation because everybody is trying to get water,"" store manager Colin Miura told CNN affiliate KGMB. Flash flooding on already saturated islands will be a main threat, along with mudslides from some of the mountainous terrain into populated areas. ""Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,"" the Central Pacific Hurricane Center said in its public advisory on Iselle early Thursday. A hurricane warning was in effect for the easternmost populated island, Hawaii, with some of the state's other islands -- Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe -- bracing for tropical storm conditions, with sustained winds of under 73 mph. Even as the storms approached Hawaii, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday it is more confident that the other side of North America will see a below-average tropical cyclone year. NOAA said that there is now a 70% chance that the number of named storms in the Atlantic this year will be at or below the 30-year average of 12. NOAA had put the chance at 50% on May 22. ""We are more confident that a below-normal season will occur because atmospheric and oceanic conditions that suppress cyclone formation have developed and will persist through the season,"" Gerry Bell, lead seasonal forecaster with the NOAA Climate Prediction Center, said. Storm dangers . Iselle should bring heavy downpours of 4 to 8 inches over the Big Island; in isolated spots up to 12 inches, the hurricane center predicts. That could cause rock and mudslides. And it would further saturate the ground in advance of Julio's arrival with more rain. Also, the storm surge could come on top of high tide, pushing 1 to 2 feet of water onto land, and depending on overlap with tides, could hit isolated areas hard. Ports are taking no chance, and Thursday, the U.S. Coast Guard upped warning levels to signal the storm was nearing. ""All oceangoing commercial vessels and oceangoing barges greater than 200 gross tons are expected to make preparations to leave the ports,"" it said. Ships wishing to remain in port are required to file a safe mooring plan . A relatively rare event . Direct hits are rare for the state. Since the 1950s, only two hurricane eyes have hit Hawaii -- and both approached from the south, where water temperature generally is warm enough to sustain the storms' strength. Iselle, however, approaches from the east, and it would be the first tropical cyclone from that direction to hit the state since the satellite era began in 1959, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. That's not to say Hawaii hasn't had close calls. The central Pacific sees an average of about five tropical cyclones a year, and some have brushed the state in recent decades. But Iselle is poised to overcome a number of factors that in recent decades conspired to keep the storms from hitting Hawaii directly or weaken them before they got there. The cyclones generally approach from the east after forming in the eastern Pacific. But close to Hawaii, dry air, cooler water and wind shear combine to weaken approaching cyclones, dissipating them before they can become a significant threat, CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said. Now, however, the water off Hawaii is warmer than usual, and that could keep Iselle at hurricane strength if it hits Hawaii island as expected Thursday, Petersons said. Hawaii's most damaging hurricane in recent decades -- Hurricane Iniki of 1992 -- came during an El Nino year, or a year of above-average sea surface temperatures. This year hasn't met the criteria for El Nino, but it could in the weeks ahead, Petersons said. Iniki killed at least four people and caused about $2 billion in damage when it hit the western Hawaiian island of Kauai, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. School's out; elections still on . The schools on the Big Island and Maui will be closed Friday as residents assess Iselle's affect. Some airlines are making concessions to customers ahead of the storms. Hawaiian Airlines moved one flight, to Los Angeles, up by five hours to beat Iselle's arrival. For people who had been scheduled to travel to or from Hawaii's airports on Thursday and Friday, United Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines say they won't charge fees to change reservations, and they'll waive differences in fares for those changes. United canceled flights to Hilo and Kona. American Airlines and US Airways also called off flights out of Kona on Thursday, but said it expected Friday's flight schedule to operate normally. Island Air will do the same for passengers ticketed from Thursday though Tuesday. Delta said it would waive fees for reservation changes for Thursday and Friday, but fare increases could apply. It said two flights had been delayed in leaving the islands. Hawaii's primary elections will go on as scheduled Saturday, despite the storms, KGMB reported. Local media reported that many turned up for early voting in expectation of severe weather on election day. Others are concerned that voter turnout could be affected. Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie has signed an emergency proclamation, his office said. It gives the government access to the state's disaster funds. CNN's Taylor Ward, Mariano Castillo, Katia Hetter, Tina Burnside and Tony Marco contributed to this report.","One gust from Hurricane Iselle was measured at 65 mph on the Big Island .

"(CNN) -- Joan Smalls was 19 years old when she left her family's home in the countryside of northern Puerto Rico to pursue dreams of walking the runway. In just four busy years, she has risen from department store catalog model to the ranks of fashion's most-sought-after models, walking for the likes of Jason Wu, Donna Karan and Tory Burch at New York's 2012 Fall Fashion Week. Along the way, she has broken barriers by becoming the first Latina face of Estee Lauder's global marketing campaigns in 2011. She has done runway shows in New York, London, Milan, and Paris and graced the pages of British, French, Spanish and U.S. versions of Vogue several times over. ""Joan is a modern beauty with elegance, style and confidence,"" said Aerin Lauder, former senior vice president, and current style and image director, of Estee Lauder. ""She is the perfect addition to Estee Lauder's global faces."" Not bad for someone who used to wear combat boots to casting calls so she could make the trek from Queens to Manhattan. ""I had to take a bus to then take the subway to then go in the city, so I wanted to be as comfortable as possible,"" she said. ""I think that had a lot to do with it, and especially at the beginning, having to go to 10, 15 castings a day, you want to be as comfortable as possible.""

"(CNN) -- Lytro cameras, which let you take a photo and refocus anywhere after it's taken, are getting two much-requested new features: Instagram-like filters and the ability to bring the entire image, not just one section, into focus. The camera was released early this year by a new Silicon Valley-based startup. Long and rectangular with a small touchscreen on one end and minimal buttons, the camera uses Light Field technology to capture its interactive images. Since the camera's release, Lytro employees have been busy testing and releasing new features. The most recent additions will be available December 4. First is the new Perspective Shift feature. Until now, you could focus only on one small section of a Lytro image at a time, which seemed to negate the benefit of having a camera that could focus on everything in the frame. Perspective Shift finally allows you to bring the entire image into focus, but that's not the most interesting part. When you click and drag on a Lytro picture, there is also a 3-D effect, allowing you move the image around for altered angles. Existing Lytro camera owners will be happy to learn that the effect can be applied to older images as well. For one test photo, Eric Cheng, Lytro's director of photography and a former underwater photographer, filled a glass Christmas ornament with paint and shot a pellet through it, capturing the explosion as it happened (click and drag the image to the left to see the effect). The desktop application will also gain new filter options. If there's anything the photography industry has learned over the past two years, it's that people love adding quick filters to their photos to make them look better. Lytro's first nine filters are a mix of typical retro -- Film Noir, 8-Track and Crayon -- and some genuinely unique effects that take advantage of the interactive features of Lytro pictures. For example, the Glass filter (below) throws up a pane of frosted glass between the foreground and the background. Click around to refocus, and it will move accordingly. Carnival distorts the photo like a funhouse mirror, undulating in different directions depending on where you focus. A year after the product was announced, the question of who exactly it is for still lingers. The $400 and up price tag is steep for a camera that takes only one kind of photo, and while it's fun to play with, it's not immediately clear what practical purpose refocusable photos serve. A flattened JPEG of a Lytro image is only 1.2 megapixels, which rules out many pro photography uses like product photography. Lytro is not sharing any sales numbers or statistics but says the camera has mostly been a hit with amateur photography enthusiasts. Enterprising customers have found some creative uses. Food bloggers are snapping interactive shots of their meals (the ability to make a bowl of ramen jiggle in 3-D could be an amazing or gross addition). An artist who makes miniature figures uses it to document her work. Bug lovers everywhere like its impressive macro photography abilities. Some in the medical field have tested the technology out, too; Lytro says there is a dermatologist who uses the camera to take up-close photos of skin issues, and a dentist takes shots of teeth. ""What we're looking for are people who are interested in storytelling in some new way,"" Cheng said. ""That's the common thread between all of our earlier camera owners."" Lytro has released other updates to the camera's firmware and desktop software over the year, including rolling out a Windows version of the desktop application and adding manual camera controls. With the manual controls, you can speed up or slow down the shutter speed to play with interesting effects like light paining. The company has also released a handful of accessories, cases and a tripod mount. There are new Lytro body colors (hot pink and forest green), but other than that, the hardware is the exact same camera that started shipping at the start of the year. The prices have also stayed the same: $399 for the 8GB camera and $499 for the 16GB version.","Lytro cameras capture photos that can be refocused after they're taken .

"(CNN) -- The family of a Rutgers University freshman who committed suicide after his roommate secretly used a webcam to stream his sexual encounter has decided not to sue the university or the man who set up the camera. Joseph and Jane Clementi had filed court documents reserving the right to sue after their son leaped from the George Washington Bridge in September 2010. Clementi's roommate, Dharun Ravi, has since been convicted of bias intimidation, invasion of privacy and witness tampering. The family's attorney said Friday that the Clementis decided to drop consideration of a lawsuit to instead focus on their work with The Tyler Clementi Foundation, a nonprofit group dedicated to working with and supporting gay and lesbian youths. ""The family got to a place where they really felt an obligation and desire to use the publicity for positive purposes,"" said attorney Paul Mainardi. ""The idea of going after money, at this point, seemed small and unimportant."" Ravi was sentenced to serve 30 days in jail and three years of probation, and to complete 300 hours of community service. He was released on June 19 after serving 20 days behind bars.

"Washington (CNN) -- Twelve U.S. soldiers face a variety of charges in what military authorities believe was a conspiracy to murder Afghan civilians and cover it up, along with charges they used hashish, mutilated corpses and kept grisly souvenirs. Five soldiers face murder charges, while seven others are charged with participating in a coverup. All of the men were members of a 2nd Infantry Division brigade operating near Kandahar in southern Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010. According to the military documents, Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs and four other soldiers were involved in throwing grenades at civilians and then shooting them in separate incidents. Three Afghan men died. Authorities allege Gibbs kept finger bones, leg bones and a tooth from Afghan corpses. Another soldier, Spc. Michael Gagnon II, allegedly kept a skull from a corpse, according to charging documents. Several soldiers are charged with taking pictures of the corpses, and one -- Spc. Corey Moore -- with stabbing a corpse. Staff Sgt. Robert Stevens is charged with lying to investigators about the deaths, saying the civilians posed a threat. Other soldiers are charged with assaulting Afghan civilians by shooting at them, and several soldiers face charges of failing to properly account for and dispose of weapons. Eight of the soldiers also are charged with using hashish and beating a junior soldier in an attempt to stop him from reporting them for misconduct, including hashish use. Gibbs is also charged with telling another soldier to lie about the incidents including the platoon's involvement in illegal drug use. He is alleged to have told Spc. Adam Winfield, ""I'm going to send you home by dropping a tow bar on you,"" if Winfield revealed information to investigators. Winfield is also charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder in this case. Five soldiers were originally arrested in June and seven others were charged last month. The documents released by the Army this week are the most detailed disclosure of what the men are alleged to have done. The five facing murder charges are Gibbs, of Billings, Montana; Pfc. Andrew Holmes of Boise, Idaho; Winfield, of Cape Coral, Florida; Spc. Michael Wagnon, of Las Vegas, Nevada; and Spc. Jeremy Morlock of Wasilla, Alaska. The five are from the 5th Stryker Brigade. Holmes is accused of killing Afghan civilian Gul Mudin in January with a grenade and rifle. Winfield is accused of killing civilian Mullah Adahdad in May in a similar manner, and Wagnon is accused of shooting to death Marach Agha in February. Morlock and Gibbs each were charged with three counts of murder and one count of assault involving the same victims as in the cases against Holmes, Wagnon and Winfield. Stevens and Pfc. Ashton Moore are charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon, and Sgt. Darren Jones is charged with conspiracy to commit assault and battery and conspiracy to commit aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon. Cpl. Emmitt R. Quintal, Staff Sgt. David Bram, Spc. Adam Kelly and Spc. Corey Moore are charged with conspiracy to commit assault and battery. Stevens is charged with wrongfully and wantonly engaging in conduct likely to cause death or bodily harm to other soldiers, and Jones, Quintal, Bram, Kelley and Corey Moore are charged with unlawfully striking another soldier.","NEW: Soldiers alleged to have kept bones, skull from Afghan civilians .

"(CNN) -- Fresh faced and full of energy, five recent graduates sit around the conference room table. They all hail from a different African country, and they all have big dreams about revamping education in their continent for a digital era. These are the headquarters of Funda in Cape Town, an online training platform that's been partnering with universities in South Africa to provide short e-courses for users. Helped by a single private investor, the tech education portal is looking to harness a growing demand for online learning by allowing students to log into classes remotely. ""At Funda, we develop learning management systems and provide content development services to higher institutions to take their courses online so that the general public can access them at a cheaper price,"" says Nigerian-born Kolawole Olajide, one of Funda's founders. The flexibility that comes with e-learning is just one of the many reasons Olajide says the online education tool has found success. ""It's responsive to the students' schedules,"" says the 22-year-old entrepreneur. ""But also managers who want to do courses but are too busy to do them can now use [Funda] and sign in when they get back from work and access the resources online."" Olajide came up with the concept for Funda -- which means ""to learn"" in Zulu -- at university when he found he couldn't take school home. He had hoped to start the company in his homeland of Nigeria, but the obstacles were too great. ""It was very difficult because they were not digitally ready,"" he recalls. ""They did not understand what I was trying to do. The second problem I faced was internet penetration in the country. I thought South Africa was more stable so Funda had a higher chance of success there because many people already have the Internet."" Alongside four other young entrepreneurs -- Kennedy Kitheka (Kenya), Jason Muloongo (Zambia), Sameer Rawjee (South Africa) and Kumbirai Gundani (Zimbabwe) -- the e-learning portal took shape and each founder provided a different perspective for the startup. None are over the age of 25, yet these innovators are simply doing what is natural to the millennial generation -- using technology to find solutions to problems they've experienced. ""We bring together the problems we've seen in different parts of Africa and we are all trying to create together solutions to the problems we have experienced in different parts of the continent,"" says Olajide. He adds: ""I was aware of user experience because user experience of technology in Nigeria was not very good. One of the other partners was keen on developing the mobile application because he said in his area of the world, there are more mobile users. So we are bringing together solutions made by the problems we've faced in Africa."" Olajide explains that Funda offers a free mobile app that can be downloaded to a user's smartphone. Students can access the e-learning portal via a keycode provided by the university they are registered to. ""At the moment, [mobile] is very limited. Mobile phones are good for getting your results, educators checking attendance reports and all that stuff. But the real core experience is from the desktop machine."" Since its launch in 2009, Funda has been recognized by several international bodies, including the United Nations Development Programme and the World Economic Forum. It has also received a number of accolades, including the ""Best Tech Innovation and Education"" award at the U.N.'s World Youth Summit in 2012 and Mazar's ""Best Sustainable Business Model"" prize. Looking ahead, Olajide has big plans for the startup. ""Our major goal is to be a major education technology provider in Africa,"" he says. ""So we're just trying to strategically position ourselves, so when Africa is ready we would also be ready."" For the time being however, the company's main focus is creating sustainable growth before proceeding to roll out the platform across the continent. As for Olajide, the passionate Nigerian says he is determined to keep on working to help increase accessibility to education in the continent. ""The future of the continent lies in how educated people are,"" he says."" All the major problems can be solved with education -- education is the key to the future.""

"(CNN) -- Two 18-year-old men face child pornography charges in connection with the case of a 17-year-old girl who hanged herself after she was allegedly gang-raped and bullied online, Canadian authorities said Thursday evening. A police statement did not provide details, but the family of Rehtaeh Parsons has said she developed suicidal thoughts after she was sexually assaulted in 2011 and a picture of the incident was shared by phone and online. The two men whose names were not released were arrested Thursday morning at their homes in Halifax, Nova Scotia, according to Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Halifax Regional Police. One man faces two counts of distribution of child pornography, authorities said. The other is accused of one count of distribution of child pornography and one count of making child pornography. The two, who were minors at the time of the incident, were released on a promise to appear August 15 in youth court. Parsons was taken off life support in April, three days after she hanged herself. Internet trolls: What to do about the scourge of the Web? The alleged sexual assault by four boys happened in November 2011 when Rehtaeh was 15, her family said. Authorities confirmed that a photograph was circulated to friends' mobile phones and computers. Police investigated, but no criminal charges were filed at that time. In April, police in eastern Canada announced they would reopen the case ""in light of new and credible information that has recently been brought forward to police."" Chief Superintendent Roland Wells of Halifax District RCMP said he hoped the arrests will help the community heal. ""A young girl has died in what was a tragic set of circumstances,"" Wells said in Thursday evening's statement. ""We all need to reflect on how we as a community can come together in Rehtaeh's memory and see what we can do to work together to support our youth."" When evidence goes viral . Parsons' mother told CNN affiliate CBC on Thursday that she felt ""better"" now that arrests have been made. Leah Parsons said she learned of the arrests when police came to her house to tell her. ""I felt a little bit of relief, just to say, finally -- like I hope -- they keep saying they want to tell their side of the story, but they have never given a statement. The police have never spoken to them in all this time. So at least, here is your chance. Tell your side of the story,"" she said. News of the arrests came one day after cybersafety legislation inspired by Parsons was implemented in Nova Scotia. Opinion: The dark side of social media . The law allows victims, among other things, to sue their alleged cyberbullies. If a bully is a minor, the bully's parents can be held liable. Officials said the timing of the arrests and the implementation of the legislation was merely a coincidence.","Police had reopened investigation; two males now face charges .

"(CNN) -- Few of us can imagine living the opulent ""Downton Abbey"" lives of the fictional Crawley family at the turn of the 20th century. There were servants to address one's every material need, dinner in white tie and lavish gowns, and rules designed to keep the upper crust on top and the lower classes in their place. You almost have to see the sprawling estate to believe that the lifestyle existed, yet the trip to visit Highclere Castle, the estate used by the television show in rural England, may cost more than the less well-to-do American can afford. There's no need to cross the pond to get a taste of that life. Although the United States did not have lords or ladies living on grand estates, there were American millionaires who made their fortunes by harnessing the resources of a new country. With an eye to the style of their European counterparts, they built mansions on extensive grounds to show off their power and wealth. So if you're entering a period of ""Downton"" withdrawal, consider a peek into America's historic high life. The places where masterpieces are born . ""These homes represented the creation of immense wealth at the turn of the century in the United States, the kind of wealth acquired through fundamental commodities like water, gold, oil and food,"" said Katherine Malone-France, the National Trust for Historic Preservation's historic sites director of outreach, education and support. ""These estates represented the taste and sophistication of their owners, as well as the skills and labors of those who built them and worked in them. These places were icons then and now, and they make for great television and fantastic places to visit as historic sites, because they contain all of those complex, compelling and interwoven stories."" The new American wealthy didn't have hundreds of years to build their fancy homes and reputations, yet the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers and other wealthy families built houses to last for generations. These are just a handful of the homes where they were living large around the same time as the ""Downton Abbey"" story lines. Downton Abbey creates tourism boom . The Rockefellers: Hudson Valley, New York . With the economic engine that is New York nearby, it makes sense that the country's new wealthy would build their homes and country homes in the city's suburbs and nearby Hudson Valley. The Vanderbilts, Roosevelts and Goulds all had homes in the area. Completed in 1913, Kykuit was the home of Standard Oil founder and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller and the next three generations of his family. The six-story home, now a National Trust for Historic Preservation property operated by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, is open to the public for tours. Make sure to tour the gardens to see New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's 20th-century sculpture collection, including the works of Alexander Calder, Henry Moore and Pablo Picasso. Kykuit's elaborate gardens also feature classical sculpture, pavilions, fountains and Hudson River views. The Douglas family: Cedar Rapids, Iowa . Like the fictional Crawleys, the Douglas family was touched by the sinking of the Titanic. Although the Brucemore estate was built for wealthy widow Caroline Sinclair and her six children in 1886, the Sinclair family lived there just 20 years. The George and Irene Douglas family and its descendants, known for Douglas & Co. and Quaker Oats, lived there from 1906 to 1981. It was George's brother Walter who perished on the Titanic. Reports say his wife, Mahala, asked him to join her on a lifeboat. He replied, ""No, I must be a gentleman"" and went to join a group of men waiting for later lifeboats. His body was recovered later and identified by his monogrammed shirt. Visitors can tour the 21-room Queen Anne style mansion and grounds. The Booths: Bloomfield Hills, Michigan . The Canadian-born owner of an ironworks company, George Booth settled in Detroit when he married Ellen Warren Scripps, the daughter of the founder of the Detroit News. The Booths purchased a rundown farm in Bloomfield Hills to turn into their summer home and eventually built a new year-round home, Cranbrook House, which was completed in 1908. George Booth became a leading patron of the American Arts and Crafts movement in the early 20th century, and it showed in the designs he chose for his home and the art he collected. The couple also started six education and arts institutions on their property, including the famous Cranbrook Academy of Art. While still alive, they deeded the house, much of its contents and the surrounding property to the Cranbrook Foundation they created, living the rest of their lives not as owners but under a life trust at Cranbrook House. It is the oldest surviving manor home in the metro Detroit area. The Vanderbilts: Asheville, North Carolina . George Vanderbilt didn't care for the city life as much as the rest of his family. So it was no surprise that after he visited the mountains of North Carolina, he eventually built his 250-room estate in Asheville. The Biltmore was completed in 1895, when he was still single. Vanderbilt married Edith Stuyvesant Dresser in Paris in 1898, and the couple raised their only child at Biltmore. Descendants of the Vanderbilts still own and operate the estate as a for-profit company, and the home is now open to the public for tours. There's a 10,000-volume library, a bowling alley, a banquet hall featuring a 70-foot ceiling, an indoor pool and the artwork of Pierre Auguste Renoir and John Singer Sargent, among others. Architect Richard Morris Hunt modeled the house after three 16th-century French chateaux. With more than 30 bedrooms, it's still shy of the 50 plus bedrooms at Downton's Highclere Castle. Still, Biltmore seems more than adequate for a house party. Don't miss the butler's tour if you want to see how the other half lived on the estate. Modern guests can stay at an inn built in 2001 or a historic cottage that once served as the gardener's house. The Bourns: Woodside, California . Filoli was completed in 1917 as the country estate for Mr. and Mrs. William Bowers Bourn, San Franciscans whose money came from water and gold. Filoli is just 30 miles outside San Francisco. The European influence can be found all over the property: Tuscan columns in the portico, art from the Bourns' travels to Europe and even some of the house's walls. (The house library was copied from the library at Denham Place, a 1690s home in England.) The expansive formal gardens were designed and constructed between 1917 and 1929. The next owners lived in the house until 1975, when the house and formal gardens were donated to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Berwinds: Newport, Rhode Island . Downton fans might remember that the mother of American-born Cora, the countess of Grantham, had a home in Newport. That's where rich Americans summered, and it's where visitors can tour several grand homes at a time. Mr. and Mrs. Edward Julius Berwind, who made their money in coal mining, built the Elms as their summer residence in Newport. Now one of the famous Newport Mansions and a National Historic Landmark, the Elms was finished in 1901. Unlike some residents of fictional Downton, who grudgingly adapted to modern conveniences like telephones and electricity, the Berwinds had the Elms outfitted with the latest modern conveniences. The house was among the first in Newport to be fully electrified with no gas backup. There was even an early ice maker. The couple's art collection featured 18th-century Venetian and French paintings and Renaissance ceramics.

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court on Monday struck down Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage, the first such decision in a southern state and another victory for gay and lesbian couples seeking the right to legally wed. ""We recognize that same-sex marriage makes some people deeply uncomfortable. However, inertia and apprehension are not legitimate bases for denying same-sex couples due process and equal protection of the laws,"" the divided three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit in Richmond concluded. Utah wins delay in same-sex marriage . The decision follows similar conclusions reached in recent weeks by another federal appeals court when tossing out bans in Utah and Oklahoma. Lower-court judges in a dozen states have also found voter-approved restrictions on the ability of same-sex couples to get married to be unconstitutional. The issue appears headed to the Supreme Court, eventually. The 4th Circuit opinion also will affect marriage laws in other states within its jurisdiction, including West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Only Maryland has legalized same-sex marriage. Separate orders would have to be issued for affected states in the region outside Virginia. Gay and lesbian couples in Virginia cannot marry in the state for at least another three weeks, giving the time for another appeal to be filed on enforcement. The Supreme Court will ultimately decide whether to review the constitutional issues pending in this case and those in several others, a process that may not begin at the earliest until later this year. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said he was ""overjoyed"" at the ruling. He and Virginia's attorney general have refused to defend the ban in court as is tradition, leaving it to other state officials to make the case. ""This is a historic ruling for our commonwealth, and its effect will affirm once again that Virginia is a state that is open and welcoming to all,"" McAuliffe, a Democrat, said in a statement. A federal judge in February struck down Virginia's ban on constitutional grounds. The prohibition has effectively been in place since Colonial days, but only incorporated into the state's constitution in 2006. Victories for marriage equality supporters . Monday's ruling continues a near-unbroken string of state and federal court victories nationwide in the past year, giving marriage-equality supporters unbridled encouragement that their ultimate goal will be achieved: striking all laws limiting the rights of homosexuals to wed. ""The choice of whether and whom to marry is an intensely personal decision that alters the course of an individual's life,"" wrote Judge Henry Floyd in an opinion supported by Judge Roger Gregory. ""Denying same-sex couples this choice prohibits them from participating fully in our society, which is precisely the type of segregation that the Fourteenth Amendment cannot countenance."" In dissent, Judge Paul Niemeyer said the issue should not be in the hands of the courts. During May oral arguments, the three seemed to agree that both sides in the case were using the appeals court as ""way-station up (Interstate) 95"" to the Supreme Court. Byron Babione, senior counsel with the group Alliance Defending Freedom, said Niemeyer noted correctly, in its view, that there is ""no fundamental right to same-sex marriage and there are rational reasons for not recognizing it,"" and that states must be permitted to have the final word. The group represents a plaintiff in defense of the ban, and is now weighing the next step. Same-sex marriage is legal in 19 U.S states plus the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington state. Other cases in play . A separate federal appeals court next month will hear separate challenges to same-sex marriage bans in the four states in its jurisdiction: Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The challenge to Virginia's ban was brought by several plaintiffs, including Timothy Bostic and Tony London of Norfolk. Two Richmond-area women, whose marriage was formalized in California, but is not recognized in the commonwealth also brought suit. Supporters of traditional marriage between one-man and one-woman have criticized the rulings in Virginia and other states, for expanding the right to homosexuals. Thirteen months ago, the Supreme Court cleared the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume. More importantly, it also rejected parts of a federal law that had denied federal benefits, such as tax breaks, to same-sex spouses.","The ruling was another victory for gay and lesbian couples seeking the right to wed .
The decision was from a three-judge panel of the appeals court in Richmond .

"Aurora, Colorado (CNN) -- Most businesses would hate to see their customers running out their doors, but in one suburban strip mall near Denver, Colorado, they are chasing the customers away -- with a chainsaw. ""We're 'hauntrepreneurs,' we like to do things that are just a little bit different,"" says KathE Walker, who owns four haunted houses in the Denver area. ""It's really exciting because you know you've done a good job,"" Walker says. ""If they are running out screaming, then the actors have done their jobs, everybody has had a good time because they want to be scared. That's why they come. ""If they're not scared, they won't come back."" KathE Walker -- the capital E isn't a typo, ""it's a '60s thing,"" she says -- laughs a lot for a woman in the business of scaring her customers. Walker, 59, runs her haunts with her husband and two grown sons. They spend the rest of the year making props for other haunted houses around the country and they throw a big science fiction convention each spring. Despite the tough economy, Walker says, business is good. She anticipates a total of 40,000-50,000 visitors, each paying $14.95 to get scared. She employs about 175 people for the Halloween season. Three of her haunts are in unused storefronts in suburban strip malls and a fourth operates out of trailers in a field near a state park. Visitors are also asked to contribute a can of food for a local food bank. Larry Kirchner, president of the Haunted House Association, says business is booming across the country for seasonal frightfests. The association says there are 2,000 for-profit haunts across the country, plus another 1,000 houses run for charity. Around 20 million fright-seekers will pay an average of $15 a visit this Halloween season, according to the group. That's a surprising figure to some in these lean economic times. ""We feel very fortunate,"" Walker says. ""I know that the economy is very scary for a lot of people. The people that we aim the haunted houses at are kids in high school and college, kids that have a lot more disposable income. They're still living with their parents. ""We don't draw a lot of people that are desperate to make their mortgages. ... It's great date-night stuff. Guys love bringing their girlfriends here, they're holding onto them. It's fun."" It's fun for Walker, too. While giving a tour of Slaughterhouse Gulch, which features a series of movie monsters, she giggles as a cluster of date-night teenagers scream and run from Leatherface, the villain from the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" films. ""You make some money, obviously that's why you keep doing it,"" she says. ""But for the most part we put a lot of money back into the haunted house so we can keep making them bigger and better. ... It can be kind of expensive. You cross your fingers each year hoping people will come."" Walker says she loves the challenge of scaring people. ""Some people come in and they say 'Oh you can't scare me,' "" she says. ""And they all end up running out of here, just terrified."" So what scares Walker? ""Clowns. I hate clowns. It took me a long time to finally let clowns be in the haunted house."" 'Scaring people is really fun' Walker staffs her haunted houses with teens and 20-somethings who seem to have as much fun as the patrons. In the makeup room, Chris Parish is getting ready for his first day on the job. He'll be playing the guy chained in the bathtub from the movie ""Saw."" ""Today is my first day scheduled, so I actually get to get paid for scaring people,"" he says. ""Scaring people is really fun and it's something that I love to do."" Halloween is makeup artist Michael Garvin's favorite time of year. He was laid off in July and hasn't been able to find another job, but during October he works days at a costume shop and nights making up the 35-40 actors who fill two of Walker's haunts. ""When I was really young I fell in love with Halloween and then horror movies,"" he said. ""I love this. I'd do this just for the fun of it, but the paycheck at the end of the month is a good thing."" Caity Strother is 18 and has had trouble finding a job. It's her second year working in Slaughterhouse Gulch, where she specializes in portraying an undead ghoul. ""I've filled out probably 50 applications in the last two months and gotten maybe four calls back,"" she said. Years of Catholic school have given Strother a skill that prospective employers have not been impressed by, but she puts it to good use in the haunted house. ""I get to yell at people in Latin,"" she says.","Denver-area ""hauntrepreneur"" runs four haunted houses with husband, two adult sons .

"(CNN) -- The South Korean ferry that sank dramatically on Wednesday with hundreds of passengers on board had been modified after coming to the country from Japan over a year ago, according to reports on CNN affiliate YTN. The Sewol -- operated by Chonghaejin Marine Corporation -- regularly plied the Incheon to Jeju route, a journey that usually takes 13-and-a-half hours, according to information from the company's website. Jeju is a popular destination in South Korea -- known as the ""Hawaii of South Korea."" The Sewol is listed at 146 meters long and with a gross tonnage of almost 7,000 tons. It boasts five cargo and accommodation decks. It is listed as having a capacity of 921 passengers, but was only carrying a reported 429 when it unexpectedly started taking on water early on Wednesday. Within hours, all that was above the water surface was the bow of the boat. The ferry was built in a Japanese shipyard 20 years ago and previously operated in that country's waters. It was refitted upon arrival in South Korea in February 2013, YTN reported. The ship's sleeping cabins were reconstructed after its arrival in South Korea, the network said. Korea Diving Industry Institute president Jung Yong-hyun, a former general in the Korean Navy and former commander of the Ship Salvage Unit (SSU) told YTN that the refit may have affected the weight of the boat and could be a reason for the accident. According to Jung, the reconstruction added around 239 tons of weight to the boat from its original form. Investigators probing the incident will likely look at various aspects of the boat, including this reconstruction. ""As the center of the weight of the boat becomes higher, it becomes more difficult for the boat to balance,"" the expert told YTN. There have been serious ferry accidents in South Korea before. The most recent maritime accident occurred in 1993. This was attributed to overcrowding. The Sewol, however, was nowhere near capacity on the night of the 15th, when it left Incheon several hours late -- delayed because of heavy fog. Tough conditions . With difficult circumstances hampering rescue dives -- including tidal currents, choppy, frigid conditions, wind, rain and seabound fog -- more radical engineering solutions are being explored. At around noon on Thursday local time, workers began trying to pump air into the boat, hoping air pockets might be expanded within the structure, helping to lift the ferry. These efforts have proved unsuccessful so far. Authorities say that they will try again when the tide turns. Analyst Jung Yong-hyun told YTN this method has been used previously, on the Costa Concordia and Cheonhanham warship wrecks, as example. Three 3,600-ton ""sea cranes"" are due to arrive Friday to assist with efforts. ""The cranes are being moved as fast as possible, the focus is getting them there early,"" said Choi Myeong-beom, a Ministries of Oceans and Fisheries representative. ""What will be done with them will be determined by the Coast Guard on site. ""If the boat has not been stuck into the seabed then we will raise (it to) the surface with cranes and move them to a place where it will be easier to work on them.""","Difficult conditions are hampering search efforts .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods' personal life went off the rails. Lance Armstrong's sporting image crashed in drugs. Both were sponsored by Nike in multi-million dollar deals. Now Nike is being reminded again that pinning your company reputation on star names is a risky business. This time it's Oscar Pistorius whose life has moved from sports headlines to the news pages to cause headaches at Nike headquarters. Pistorius, known as the 'blade runner,' is the man Nike called a bullet and who is now charged with shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. With Pistorius, Nike had a star able to attract supporters to disabled athletics and who was so fast he could compete against able-bodied runners. And Nike knew how to market that appeal -- with an ad in 2011 that showed the sprinter starting from blocks and the caption ""I am the bullet in the chamber"" together with Nike's ""Just do it"" slogan and logo. Robbie Vorhaus, founder of Vorhaus & Company, which advises companies on maintaining their reputations, said there was a deep conversation taking place in marketing about how to avoid such advertising ricochets with forward thinking and less clichÃ©. He said: ""Double entendres, sexual references and phrases that include violence are being looked at for exactly this reason. A bullet in the chamber still represents a gun and a gun represents a weapon."" Vorhaus said a brand hit by a scandal surrounding a sponsor approach should aim to move on. ""The problem is that so much money is pinned on human beings who in a moment of passion or intoxication, can ruin their reputation in an instant. ""It is not the responsibility of Nike to be a parent or rescue a person if they break the law. ""These athletes have certain qualities that a brand emulates but at the moment they are harming the brand ... they have to cut the association quickly and move on."" He added that there would be clauses in the Pistorius-Nike contract that make clear when the athlete's behavior can allow the company to cut its ties -- and law-breaking would often be among the reasons. Opinion: Pistorius case and the plague of violence against women . Many companies look at widening a campaign beyond the pulling power of the celebrity but so far playing out, in the planning stages of a campaign, ""what if"" a worst-case scenario happens is not common practice. Another industry executive said celebrities should not be used as the focus of a campaign but as a way of introducing a wider campaign issue. That way, if the star derails, the wider campaign can continue. Nike issued a statement soon after Steenkamp's death expressing ""sympathy and condolences to the families concerned following this tragic incident."" On Sunday, Pistorius' management company announced that Pistorius had pulled out of five contracted race meets, but that his sponsors were standing by him. ""I can confirm that at this point in time, all parties are supportive and their contractual commitments are maintained. They have said they are happy to let the legal process takes its course before making any change in their position,"" said his agent Peet Van Zyl in a statement. The 26-year-old South African double amputee sprinter was officially charged with killing Reeva Steenkamp on Friday. Prosecutors said they plan to argue that the attack was premeditated. Pistorius rejects the murder allegation ""in the strongest terms,"" Van Zuyl said. It is not the first time Nike has sponsored a scandal-hit star. Tiger Woods was a Nike man when details of his numerous affairs became public. He still is. Nike stood with Lance Armstrong throughout his career until the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency came up with enough evidence to convince the world of his cheating. He was then dropped. Marketing specialist Adam Handt said Nike should do something immediately such as suspending its relationship with Pistorius because of the severity of the accusations against him. Vorhaus said a brand used to like having just one person represent it, but those days are gone, and deals are struck with many athletes -- from both sexes, from across races and from across national regions and from different countries. In this marketing world, Vorhaus said, with many athletes sponsored by and representing Nike, it is also easier to shake off the bad publicity when a star falls.","Nike carried ad calling Oscar Pistorius a bullet .

"(CNN) -- As Egyptian authorities vowed quick vengeance for a terrorist attack that killed 16 soldiers, officials in Egypt and Israel disagreed as to who was to blame for the bloodshed. On Sunday, attackers with semiautomatic weapons and hand grenades stole two armored vehicles from Egyptian forces and tried to enter Israel. Israel blamed militants associated with the group Global Jihad for the violence. Egyptian military officials called the attackers ""enemies"" of the nation. The Muslim Brotherhood accused the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad for the killings. Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, who resigned from the Muslim Brotherhood before he took office recently, condemned the attack, which also wounded seven soldiers, three critically. He vowed Monday ""to capture those who conducted this traitorous attack on our sons."" Morsy and Egypt's long-time top military leader, Field Marshal Muhammad Tantawi, visited Monday the area where the attack on the troops, who were breaking their Ramadan fast at sunset, took place. According to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, there were 35 assailants -- terrorist factions from Gaza, it said -- involved in the attack near the Rafah border crossing in the Sinai, a restive area of Egypt where there have been kidnappings and armed clashes in recent months. ""Egyptians will not have to wait long before they see a reaction to this attack by terrorists,"" the SCAF said on its Facebook page. Eight attackers were killed by Israeli forces, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak told a TV audience. One of the vehicles exploded at the border, and the other was attacked by Israel's air force as it was entering Israeli territory, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said. More: Clinton warns Sinai could turn into jihadist haven . The Rafah border crossing has been closed indefinitely, North Sinai security official Ahmed Bakr said. And more Egyptian military forces have been deployed to the area to assist. ""Our forces will impose a full control on these areas,"" Morsy said in an address to the nation. ""Sinai is safe and fully under control -- those who did this will pay a high price."" The Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a statement Monday giving ""condolences to Egypt and to the Egyptian people"" after the attack, which ""was meant to slay Israelis as well."" The violence was ""aimed at shattering the peace agreement between Israel and Egypt,"" it said. Barak briefed a Knesset subcommittee on the incident. ""IDF forces ... showed vigilance, sharpness, and purposefulness in thwarting the terrorist attack that could have caused many casualties,"" he said. ""The terrorists' operational means once again demonstrate the need for a determined move by our Egyptian counterparts in order to enforce the rule of law and security in the Sinai region."" According to the Israel Defense Forces website, IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai said Sunday that Israel had obtained intelligence before the attack that ""enabled the IDF to prevent the Global Jihad terrorists from infiltrating from Egypt into Israel. This is an extremely serious incident."" The IDF is ""is in contact with the Egyptians and we will study this event, which is a product of the terror infrastructure in Sinai."" ""We tracked this attempted attack, and fortunately there are no injuries among IDF forces or residents of the area,"" Mordechai said. In recent months, Israeli forces have been involved in clashes with militants near the Jewish state's border with the Sinai. In June, attackers fired on Israelis working on the security barrier between the two countries. Egyptian intelligence officials have said that cells of al Qaeda and other extremist groups are operating in Sinai. Americans have been abducted in Sinai and then released shortly afterward several times so far this year. Kidnappings and armed robberies have increased since a popular uprising ousted Egypt's long-ruling dictator, Hosni Mubarak, last year. Morsy called on the military council Monday to hold an emergency meeting, state TV in Egypt reported. Hamas, the movement that controls the Palestinian territory of Gaza, condemned the Sunday attack, calling it an ""ugly crime."" Hamas officials closed all border tunnels connecting Gaza with Egypt after of the attack, according to Tahir Al-Nono, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A Georgia man convicted of kidnapping and killing his girlfriend was executed Tuesday. A Geogia official says executed killer William Earl Lynd did not make a final statement. William Earl Lynd was the first inmate to die by injection since September, when the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider whether the three-drug combination represented cruel and unusual punishment. The process began at 7:34 p.m. and ended 17 minutes later at 7:51 p.m., said Paul Czachowski, public affairs manager for the Georgia Department of Corrections. ""The condemned declined to make a last statement or accept a prayer; he remained quiet and calm throughout the whole procedure,"" he said. Lynd, 53, had requested as his last meal two pepper jack BBQ burgers with crisp onions, two baked potatoes with sour cream, bacon and cheese and a large strawberry milkshake -- all from a local restaurant. The U.S. Supreme Court had refused to stay Lynd's execution hours earlier Tuesday. ""The application for stay of execution of sentence of death presented to Justice [Clarence] Thomas and by him referred to the court is denied,"" the court said. Georgia became the first state to resume executions since the court validated the lethal injection process last month with a ruling in a Kentucky case. All but one of the 36 states with capital punishment use a three-drug mixture: an anesthetic, a muscle paralyzer and a heart-stopping substance. Death penalty opponents have argued that if inmates are not given enough anesthetic, they could be conscious enough to suffer excruciating pain without being able to express it because of the paralyzer. The court's decision in the Kentucky case prompted about a dozen states to announce they would resume executions.  Watch a report on the decision » . On Monday, Texas officials said they plan to execute Mexican-born Jose Medellin in August for the gang rape and murder of two teenage girls 15 years ago in Houston. In Mississippi, authorities had planned to execute Earl Wesley Berry on Monday, but the state Supreme Court set the date for May 21. Berry was convicted of kidnapping a woman from a church parking lot in 1987, beating her to death and dumping her body in a wooded area. In the Georgia case, Lynd was convicted of fatally shooting his girlfriend, Virginia ""Ginger"" Moore, in Berrien County in 1988. During the trial, prosecutors painted Moore's death as especially agonizing and lengthy. According to trial testimony, Lynd shot Moore in the face, and she fell unconscious onto a bed. He then went outside to smoke a cigarette. Moore regained consciousness and staggered outside, where she was shot a second time and put into the trunk of her car. After driving to a nearby farmhouse, Lynd said he heard Moore kicking inside the trunk, according to testimony. He opened the trunk and shot her a third time, this time fatally. As the sentence was being carried out, about 20 opponents of the death penalty prayed and sang songs outside the prison, located 45 minutes south of Atlanta, said Laura Moye, chairwoman of Georgians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty. ""We're here to express our opposition to the state of Georgia taking human life on behalf of U.S. citizens of Georgia,"" she said. ""We are sad and upset that our state is leading the country in resumption of executions. We think this rush to executions is irresponsible in light of the many well-documented problems that have been revealed about the death penalty."" Human rights groups have also raised the possibility that an innocent person could be put to death. They pointed to Friday's release in North Carolina of Levan ""Bo"" Jones, an African-American inmate who spent 14 years on death row before a judge said the evidence was faulty and overturned his murder conviction. The charges have been dropped. Georgia prosecutors, however, maintain that the death penalty is carried out fairly in their state. ""There's been no evidence in this state -- and I'm not aware of any in the country -- that any demonstrably innocent person has been put to death,"" said Tommy Floyd, chairman of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia. ""No prosecutor I know wants to execute an innocent person."" There have been 40 executions in the state since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, ruling in a Georgia case. Lynd was the 17th inmate executed by injection in the state. In Virginia, a May 27 execution date has been set for death row inmate Kevin Green, and the state is proceeding on schedule, said David Clementson of the Virginia attorney general's office. Four executions are set in Texas for June and July; in Louisiana, former New Orleans police officer Antoinette Frank is set to die in July. If she is executed, she would be the first woman put to death in three years. South Dakota, which has sent one inmate to death in three decades, has scheduled a lethal injection in October. Florida, Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois and Oklahoma have said they will resume capital punishment as soon as possible. Nebraska is the only state that does not use lethal injection, but its use of the electric chair was ruled unconstitutional in February. Texas and Mississippi are among the states that use 2 grams of sodium thiopental, the anesthetic used to render condemned inmates unconscious. Kentucky and other states use 3 grams, a standard that the Supreme Court judged to be constitutional. CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report.","NEW: Georgia executes inmate convicted of killing girlfriend in 1988 .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Hip-hop singer Wyclef Jean heard ""the sound of the boom"" and then realized he was ""grazed by a bullet"" in Port-au-Prince Saturday night, the eve of Haiti's presidential runoff election, Jean told CNN. A Haitian national police spokesman said that Jean was treated at a hospital for an injury, but he would not confirm if it was from a bullet or from glass. The wound was superficial and ""he is doing well,"" Jean spokeswoman Cindy Tanenbaum said. Jean said he suffered the wound on his hand soon after stepping out of his car to talk on his phone. He was treated by a doctor at a hospital and released, Tanenbaum said. Jean would not comment on if he suspected he was targeted by a shooter. ""I can't even speculate,"" he said. The police investigation was stalled by Jean's refusal to speak to police about the incident, according to Garry Desrosiers, a spokesman for the Haitian national police. Jean has been helping the presidential campaign of popular musician Michel Martelly, who is on the ballot against former first lady Mirlande Manigat in Sunday's pivotal presidential runoff election. ""It was nothing,"" said Damien Merlo, a spokeman for the Martelly campaign. ""He's fine and out and about getting out the vote for us."" Final results of the runoff will be released on April 16, according to officials. Jean called Sunday's vote ""historical."" ""This was done, the majority of it, with technology,"" he said. ""It's going great because this moment in history is being defined with the technology, Facebook, Twitter, SMS, Livestream."" Jean, who was born in Haiti, shot to fame in the mid-1990s as a member of the Fugees, a U.S.-based hip-hop and reggae group. He now performs as a solo artist. He has been an outspoken proponent of Haiti through his Yele Haiti Foundation and was one of the first celebrities to offer aid after the last year's devastating earthquake. In September, he officially ended his bid to be president of Haiti a month after election officials ruled that he was ineligible to run. Jean previously vowed to fight the Haitian electoral council's ruling that he was not a resident of the country. His eligibility had been in question after claims that he had not lived in Haiti for five consecutive years prior to the election, a requirement in the nation's constitution.

"(CNN) -- Known as ""The Four Musketeers,"" they won fame and fortune on courts across western Europe in a golden era of style and glamor. Some 80 years later, a new quartet of dashing young men is seeking to make a similar mark for France. Rene Lacoste, Henri Cochet, Jean Borotra and Jacques ""Toto"" Brugnon were collectively unbeatable in the 1920s and early 1930s, dominating world tennis for almost a decade and establishing France as a major power in the sport. Named after a film version of the classic Alexandre Dumas novel, they ended U.S. supremacy in the prestigious Davis Cup teams competition, winning it six years in a row, and claimed 43 grand slam singles and doubles titles between them. The famous Roland Garros venue was built in Paris to host the following year's Davis Cup defense, after their famous victory in Philadelphia in 1927, and the French Open's men's singles trophy was named after them. After their demise, France had to wait 59 long years for another Davis Cup triumph, and it has been a decade since its last -- and ninth overall -- title. The last Frenchman to win a grand slam was Yannick Noah, in Paris in 1983. But a modern group of players, dubbed ""The New Musketeers"" by national sports newspaper L'Equipe, are striving to carve their own place in history. Gael Monfils, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gilles Simon and Richard Gasquet were ranked in the world's top 13 after this month's U.S. Open, raising hopes that they can do better than when similarly placed as fresh-faced youngsters in 2008. Last year they took France to the final of the Davis Cup, losing to Novak Djokovic's Serbia, and this weekend they will travel to Spain, the home nation of the world No.1's predecessor Rafael Nadal, in a bid to again reach the title decider. Victory in Spain would likely set up a rematch with the Serbs, who host Argentina in the other semifinal -- with the champions undoubtedly fired up by Djokovic's U.S. Open triumph. ""When you don't have goals, when you don't have dreams, you are already dead. And this is a dream to win against Spain, in Spain,"" Tsonga told CNN's Open Court. In 2008, he lost to Djokovic in the Australian Open final, and this year he was beaten by the Serb in the Wimbledon semifinals before falling to Roger Federer in the last eight in New York. The all-action 26-year-old will spearhead France's challenge on clay in Cordoba, with world No. 7 Monfils ruled out due to a knee injury following his second-round exit at Flushing Meadows. While he and his colleagues have all been ranked in the top 10, they are painfully aware they must take the next step and win major titles before they can be talked of in the same way as their more illustrious compatriots. ""We have to win the Davis Cup first,"" Monfils said. ""And then, we try to win a grand slam ... but I think we need two or three Davis Cups and then maybe we can be like musketeers."" The original foursome came from very different backgrounds, with Lacoste the most famous after establishing a fashion label once his glittering playing career had finished as well as inventing the steel tennis racket. ""Lacoste came from a very wealthy family,"" veteran American sports journalist Bud Collins told CNN. ""His father manufactured automobiles and he fell in love with tennis when he visited some relatives in England. His father said what are you going to do with yourself? Rene said: 'I want to be a tennis player.' His father said: 'Okay, but only if you can be the best.' "" Borotra moved into politics during World War Two, serving as General Commissioner to Sports in the Vichy government during the Nazi occupation before being arrested by the Gestapo in 1942. He lived to the age of 95 and founded the International Fair Play Committee. ""He was very gallant. He came from the Basque region and he was called 'the Bounding Basque,' "" Collins said. Cochet, nicknamed ""the Ball Boy of Lyon"" due to his role before becoming a successful player, was a world No. 1 like Lacoste and won seven grand slam singles titles. Brugnon was a doubles specialist who won 12 major titles in that discipline and died in 1978 aged 83 -- two years after they were simultaneously inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame. Of the new breed, most was expected of Gasquet -- a child prodigy who ranked as high as seventh in 2007, but has been rebuilding his career since a three-month absence in 2009 after testing positive for cocaine. ""Gasquet really had a rough time in that he was on the cover of magazines when he was nine, 10 years old,"" Collins said of a player who won the French Open mixed doubles title as a teenager in 2004. ""In France, they were so excited about him, but it didn't help him. Too much was expected. With the other guys, if they got together, they can pull the best out of him, because he should be the best player."" Tsonga also tipped his colleague to continue his recent improvement. ""Richard is really, really talented. I think he has improved a lot these past couple of months. He's tougher in his head and I think he's going to play well in the future,"" he said. ""For him it was really difficult because he was really good really early, and all the pressure was on him. It's not easy when you are young. For me it was completely different and I think far more easy."" Collins calls Tsonga, whose father is Congolese, ""probably the most exciting in the team."" ""He just goes all out, diving for the ball, everything. At Wimbledon, losing the first two sets to Roger Federer ... that never happened before. Federer never lost the final-set match. And Tsonga is appealing, he looks like Muhammad Ali, he's terrific."" Paris-born Monfils is another larger than life character, with his tattoos and dark, good looks from his Caribbean heritage -- his mother is from Martinique, his father Guadeloupe. ""Oh he's exciting,"" Collins said. ""When he's gonna lose, he jumps in the stands, he's gonna do push-ups -- dive for ball, which he certainly will. ""And he's got a comical outlook on things -- you know, he's a real prize. But then again, he's this guy who doesn't quite make it."" Monfils said a passion for tennis is their biggest bond. ""We are all different -- really different because we come different parts of France,"" he said. ""Tennis is the only thing we have in common. We have tennis and that's it. For us it's a passion, I think, and this is why we are friends."" All four players live in Switzerland, and Gasquet said their friendly rivalry is helping them to progress. ""They are my friends, so it's very good. We try to win the Davis Cup this year,"" the 25-year-old said. ""It's really nice to have them on the tour with me. It's a nice competition between us because when one is playing good, we try to do the same."" While Monfils and Tsonga make headlines with their athletic, never-say-die displays, and Gasquet with his undoubted talent, Simon is the quiet achiever of the group. Ranked as high as sixth in 2009 and a nine-time winner on the ATP Tour, the slightly-built 26-year-old relies more on guile and baseline tenacity. ""He's very smart. He can run for hours and hours,"" Gasquet said. ""It's very hard to play with him on a baseline. ""You don't see him like Jo or Gael. He's not very muscular. But he's very, very tough to beat."" Despite being aware of the feats of the original foursome from an early age -- statues commemorate the players at Roland Garros -- Monfils said he and his colleagues are not consciously trying to emulate them. ""Right now, I don't really think about 'to be a musketeer,' about the history. When you finish your career maybe you can say, 'Ah they were maybe the next musketeers.' Right now, you know, I don't think about it."" Simon agrees. ""We manage to beat Rafa and Roger sometimes, and Novak also. And it's a good generation -- we are good players but still there are far better players than us on the tour,"" he said. ""And we just try to win one slam also, because the last one was Yannick Noah in 1983. It's 30 years ago. So, everybody wants us to do something very good. That's why they call us this (musketeers). But for sure we don't deserve it.""","France seeking to reach the final of the Davis Cup for second year in a row .

"(CNN) -- E-books aren't just becoming increasingly popular. They also appear to be promoting reading habits among American adults. So says new research from the Pew Internet and American Life Project, which states that about one-fifth of U.S. adults have read an e-book in the past year. And if you expand that to include Americans over 16 who have used an e-reader device or app to read news articles or magazine-style features, the figure jumps to 43%. E-book users tend to read more often than people who read only print material, Pew found. In particular, they read more books. A typical e-book user read 24 books in the past year, compared with the 15 books reported by typical non-e-book users. Also, a third of people who read e-content say they now spend more time reading than they did before e-books. This is especially true for people who own tablets and e-book readers. This might be good for the economy. According to Pew, e-book users are ""also more likely than others to have bought their most recent book, rather than borrowed it, and they are more likely than others to say they prefer to purchase books in general."" E-readers and tablets (including Amazon's Kindle Fire e-reader, which is a modified Android tablet) were a popular holiday gift item last year. Currently 28% of Americans age 18 and older own at least one tablet or an e-book reader. And that's not even counting the people who read books on a smartphone or iPod Touch app. Then again, Pew also noted that e-book users often start searching for books online -- which isn't great news for people who run brick-and-mortar bookstores. For now, print reading material still rules the consumer market, however. Pew found that nearly three-fourths of U.S. adults read a printed book in 2011, and 11% listened to an audiobook. Print books are especially popular when people read to children. Print books are also the most popular choice when people want to borrow or lend a book. That's not surprising -- recently author Dave Taylor explained step-by-step how to borrow a Kindle book from a public library. It's not too difficult, but is still considerably more complicated than walking into the library and pulling a book off the shelf. The survey also found that just slightly more people prefer e-books over print for reading in bed. On the flip side, Pew noted that nearly 20% of U.S. adults said they had not read a single book in the past year. In general, people who don't own electronic reading devices are more likely not to read much at all. In addition, nearly 20% of Americans 16 and older said they had ""physical or health conditions that made reading difficult or challenging."" Most of these people are older (25% of those over age 50), unemployed or low-income. But an interesting aspect of e-book and audiobook technology is its potential to improve the accessibility of written content. Most e-reading devices allow the reader to adjust the font, font size, contrast, column width, and other factors to compensate for impaired vision. Plus, they often include text-to-speech technology that can read books or articles aloud -- maybe not with thrilling delivery, but still a useful option. This can also be helpful to people with limited literacy. The cost of e-reading devices keeps dropping, and it's likely that in the next year or two companies like Amazon may be giving away basic e-readers for free (on the principle that you can make more money selling ""blades"" than ""razors""). As the price of e-readers approaches zero, it opens up more opportunities for people who have been left on the wrong side of the digital divide to access the same wealth of information, entertainment and education as people with normal vision and average-or-better income. Since the invention of writing, the written word has always disrupted the balance of power in societies. While e-books might have started out as a high-tech novelty for early adopters, they may ultimately prove to be a great equalizer across boundaries of ability, resources and education. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","E-book users tend to read more often than people who read only print material, a survey finds .

"Kiev (CNN) -- Nearly six months since popular protests toppled pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych, fighting between Ukraine's military and pro-Russia rebels continues in eastern Ukraine. Russia insists that it should be permitted to send aid to the conflict-battered region, many of whose residents are Russian speakers. It has sent a convoy of trucks it says are carrying relief goods to the border. But the Kiev government has expressed fears that the mission is a camouflaged effort to smuggle supplies to pro-Russia rebels. Both countries have asked the International Committee of the Red Cross for help facilitating any delivery of aid."" From Kiev, CNN's Will Ripley explains what's happening on the ground. What do the rebels still control? The rebels still control the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, as well as some border checkpoints in the east. However, the Ukrainian military appears to have been quickly retaking the territory around the two cities. It claims that the militants control just 20% of the area they controlled at the height of their power in eastern Ukraine. Is the Ukraine military still advancing? Yes, and it appears in recent days the Ukrainian military has been making headway against the rebel forces. Maps provided by the Ukrainian government indicate the size of the rebel territory is shrinking every day. The strategy of the Ukrainian military has been to break up and isolate the territories, cutting off key roadways and corridors to disrupt what it says is a flow of weapons and fighters from Russia. Russia denies claims by Kiev and the West that it is providing support to the rebels. Why is Russia sending convoys -- both aid and military -- now? Publicly, Russian officials claim their humanitarian convoy only contains aid to help the people who are suffering in eastern Ukraine. But there are reports that some of the trucks now being inspected are nearly empty. Meantime, Western journalists and the Ukrainian government report an armed Russian convoy was seen crossing the border from Russia Thursday night, something Ukraine has been alleging for months. Such reports feed into the skepticism of the Ukrainian government about this supposed humanitarian aid. What's the perceived threat? Is this an invasion or just a show of force? It's not an invasion, and not really a show of force either because these armed convoys have allegedly been crossing under the cover of night. As for Russia's humanitarian convoy, it appears to be a move allowing Russia to publicly show its sympathy for those are currently suffering because of the fighting in eastern Ukraine. But allegations of covert weapons smuggling that would allow the bloodshed to continue, raise questions about Russia's true intentions. In an interview Monday with Reuters, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen spoke of a ""high probability"" that Russia will invade Ukraine. ""We see the Russians developing the narrative and the pretext for such an operation under the guise of a humanitarian operation, and we see a military buildup that could be used to conduct such illegal military operations in Ukraine,"" he said. What has been the reaction in Kiev? Kiev lawmakers and military officials are not surprised. They say this is nothing new, it's just the first time that Western journalists have observed an armed convoy crossing from Russia into Ukraine. They're also grateful that foreign journalists have been able to observe and report on this armed convoy because they feel it corroborates their ongoing claims and justifies their skepticism and mistrust of the true intentions of this Russian aid convoy from Moscow. What's the bigger picture: Is this all about Putin warning the West not to expand into Ukraine, and other former Soviet satellite states? Ukrainian lawmakers believe that Putin wants to control Ukraine in an attempt to reestablish a new version of the former Soviet Union. Ukraine would be an important part of that plan. At the same time, if Ukraine were to align more closely with Europe and see its economy revived, it would not bode well for Russian citizens, who are watching closely what is unfolding in Ukraine. For example, the former the Soviet state of Poland saw tremendous economic benefits after its alignment with Europe, while under pro-Russian Yanukovych, Ukraine's economy plummeted and government corruption ran rampant. Russia wants to exert its power and influence, and if Ukraine successfully integrates into the European Union -- and benefits from that partnership -- it would be a huge setback for Russia politically and strategically.","Nearly six months after Ukraine's pro-Russia president fell, clashes continue in the east .

"(CNN) -- Dubai on Monday officially inaugurated the centerpiece of its decade-long construction boom, with the surprise revelation that the world-beating 168-story skyscraper -- seen by some as a symbol of the city's economic excess -- was even bigger than previously thought. In a glitzy firework-lit ceremony, the city-state's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum unveiled a plaque commemorating the event and also announced that the $1.5 billion structure has a new name: the Burj Khalifa. Named after Khalifa Bin Zayed, the president of the United Arab Emirates -- and ruler of Abu Dhabi, which recently bailed out debt-ridden Dubai to the tune of $10 billion -- the tower was officially recorded as 828 meters tall, adding 10 meters on to previous height claims. Six years in the making, and now 319 meters higher than previous skyscraping record-holder Taipei 101, Dubai's newest edifice commands dizzying views of the ambitious building program that has transformed the emirate. The structure's architects, Chicago-based Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, have called the Burj Khalifa ""a bold global icon that will serve as a model for future urban centers."" Declaring that ""tall buildings are back,"" the company predicts that the groundbreaking techniques it used to push the Burj Khalifa to new heights should enable the construction of even taller towers in the future. iReport: Share your photos of the world's tallest buildings . ""As with any project, SOM's architects and engineers learned a great deal and are ready to apply this to the next world's tallest building as it is certainly possible to go taller,"" it said. Despite such lofty claims, the Burj Khalifa -- and other construction projects including the Palm Jumeirah and World archipelagos of man-made islands built for the super-rich -- have cast a financial shadow over Dubai. Last year the emirate shocked investors by asking for a freeze on payments owed on its $26 billion in debts. The announcement by Dubai World -- an umbrella group which includes the Burj Khalifa's developers --delivered a cold dose of reality to speculators worldwide who believed the oil-rich region was impervious to the global financial crisis. Facts and figures: Why Dubai is looking up . While predicted economic recovery are likely to help Dubai to shake off some of its debt woes, if not fully regain its boom-time ebullience, some say the city's path of prestige over practicality will leave projects like the Burj Khalifa struggling to justify their place in the Gulf state's skyline. ""Dubai doesn't really need to have to build tall asides from prestige purposes,"" Jim Krane, author of ""City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism"" told CNN in a recent interview. ""If you look at it, it's a really bad idea. It uses as much electricity as an entire city. And every time the toilet is flushed they've got to pump water half a mile into the sky,"" he said. The telescopic shape also presents problems of a more practical nature Krane says. ""The upper 30 or 40 floors are so tiny that they're useless, so they can't use them for anything else apart from storage. They've built a small, not so useful storage warehouse half a mile in the sky,"" he said. CNN's Barry Neild and Matt Knight contributed to this story.","Dubai on Monday officially opened the world's largest tower, reaching half a mile into the sky .

"(CNN) -- A luxury cruise ship collided in deep fog with a container ship off Vietnam, punching a hole in the container ship and knocking passengers off their feet, a passenger told CNN Monday. ""The foghorn at the back of the ship had been going off consistently, throughout the morning,"" passenger Andrew Lock said Monday from Hong Kong about the incident, which occurred Friday morning when the Silver Shadow was about five miles from the coast. ""But there was a certain point in time when the foghorn at the front of the ship suddenly sounded. And it was much much louder. And it caused us to look up. And in fact we looked up straight out of the window. And through the fog, to our horror, we saw this Vietnamese container ship appear, sideways on. And it was as if our ship was perfectly lined up to hit it in the side. Lock said he and his wife had braced themselves for the impact and stayed upright. ""So, it was a horrifying moment. And in less than about five seconds after the ship appeared. We did in fact collide right in the side of it."" In a statement, Silversea Cruises said the Silver Shadow ""was involved in a minor incident on March 16, 2012, at around 4:20 GMT as it was approaching the pilot station in Ha Long Bay, Vietnam. There was contact between Silver Shadow and a local commercial vessel. Silver Shadow incurred limited minor dents and guests' safety was never compromised. The ship was fully operational and continued on its course to Ha Long Bay, where all shore tours operated normally."" Lock disputed the cruise line's characterization of the incident. ""It was a major collision,"" he said. Deanna Kratzenberg and her husband Wes Harder were in their suite when the collision occurred. The Vancouver couple recalled hearing the vessel's horn blast several times. Then they felt the ship hit something. ""It was like a full stop. Just -- boom!"" she said. Lock said he and his wife saw that the container ship was damaged. ""The Vietnamese ship rolled over -- at a 90-degree angle,"" Lock said. ""In fact, we thought it was going to capsize. It then righted itself. And with the forward momentum of our ship, it pushed the Vietnamese ship around, so that it actually came down the side, the length of our ship, scraping along the side as it went. And from that viewpoint, we could see just how much damage had been done to that ship, and it was substantial."" He said he wasn't aware of any injuries aboard the luxury vessel, which had a hole dug in its bow, but said the other vessel was badly damaged. ""We struck the other ship in several places that we could see -- we struck it at the bridge, where they would operate from,"" Lock said. ""We literally crushed the ship inwards. And we also struck the sides of the ship, causing a tear along the side, a vertical tear, quite substantial. And as we passed by the other ship, I personally saw several of their crew members just lying on the deck."" See Lock's iReport image . Kratzenberg says she and her husband were not instructed by cruise staff about what to do after the collision. There was confusion in the hallways as passengers tried to figure out what had happened and whether they were safe, she said. ""There was a lot of fear,"" she said. ""The people around me were crying...For quite some minutes there was nothing to indicate what the crew were [doing] or what [we should] do."" The couple and Lock say that passengers gathered a few of their possessions and headed to the muster stations. ""The crew was calm, but the passengers -- some were scared, or even frantic,"" Lock said. But after about 10 minutes, the captain announced that there was no imminent danger, he said. As they made their way to the station, Deanna Kratzenberg said she and her husband approached cruise officers and asked them how the collision happened. Wasn't there radar or some kind of technology aboard that would warn if another ship was close? She says cruise employees repeatedly answered by saying that the cruise ship ""had the right of way."" When they kept asking questions, she says cruise staffers walked away. ""I would use the word arrogant,"" she said. ""They were acting as if we had, really, no right to ask the question."" The ship went on to anchor in Ha Long Bay as planned. ""The next day, we went to a nearby port and once we were off the ship we could see how extensive the damage was,"" Lock said. Silversea said it will carry out a full investigation into the incident. The 28,258-ton Silver Shadow was built in 2000. It was refurbished last year and is registered in the Bahamas. It carries a maximum of 382 passengers and a crew of 302. It is scheduled to depart March 28 on a seven-day voyage starting and ending in Singapore, according to Silversea's website. Best available fare is listed as $3,599. Silversea is based in Monaco and has offices in the United States, Britain, Australia and Singapore.","Luxury cruise ship hits container vessel in thick fog off coast of Vietnam .

"(CNN) -- Grandeur defines Istanbul: From architectural icons such as Hagia Sophia to the city's indomitable traffic, Istanbul pulsates with intensity and splendor. Including sweet splendor. Istanbul's passion for pastries and its history of inventing some of the world's most delightful desserts tempts visitors and residents to skip dinner and head straight for the meal's concluding course. Where do you go to eat like a local? Share your photos and tips . Here's a taste of the most inventive, decadent and eccentric sweets from this culinary crossroads: . Sahlep: This mild beverage is Istanbul's answer to hot chocolate. Originating during the Ottoman Empire, sahlep's key ingredient is crushed orchid, which is used to thicken warm milk before being sweetened with sugar and cinnamon. Common during the winter, but also available at other times, sahlep is great for warming one's insides during a brisk walk along the Bosphorus. It can be found in many of the stands near Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque. If you want to sit down to enjoy it, Saray Muhallebicisi, which has locations throughout the city, prepares a particularly delicious mug. Nut pastes (marzipan) and dragees: Istanbul loves nuts. Travelers can buy crisp almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts by the pound at the Spice Bazaar, but they can also find these nuts at the center of some of Istanbul's finest desserts. Nut pastes -- literally made from a combination of crushed nuts and sugar -- are common in Istanbul confections, from the traditional almond-based marzipan to hazelnut and pistachio varieties. These pastes are available for purchase as bite-sized ovals, as well as in longer tube shapes or molded and colored to look like fruits. Bring a big appetite to Bologna . Travelers may also want to sample dragees, which are nuts covered in chocolate and a hard candy shell. Known in the United States as Jordan almonds, Istanbul confectioners often use other nuts besides the almond as a base and utilize colorful coatings, including silver or gold. With five locations across the city, including a charming one across the Bosphorus on the Asian side, the more than 200-year-old Şekerci Cafer Erol sells some of the most delightful renderings of these sweets. And their nut pastes not only look like fruits but taste like them (imagine marzipan shaped as a strawberry that has a strawberry essence to it). After purchasing some of the various sweets, be sure to enjoy a cup of Turkish coffee at one of their outside tables. Candied fruits: Made by boiling fruit in sugar syrup, candied citrus rinds are the most popular form of this product. But Turkish confectioners take the process to new heights, candying everything from cherries to olives. Candying tends to give the fruit a chewy or hard texture along with intense sweetness, so you may only want to try this delicacy in small quantities. Iconic confectioner Hafiz Mustafa, in business since 1864, sells a particularly creative mix that can be purchased a la carte, including pumpkin, fig, tomato, orange and chestnut (the chestnuts are especially delicious). Across the Bosphorus on the Asian side of the city, the famed foodie restaurant Çiya sells not only some of the most delicious savory meals in Istanbul but also a variety of candied fruits with clotted cream or tahini and walnut toppings -- make sure to sample the pumpkin. The restaurant also has homemade ice creams in exotic flavors that change on a daily basis. Lokum (Turkish delight): Confectioner Bekir Effendi is credited with popularizing this dessert in the 18th century, when it became known as Turkish delight in English. Originally, Effendi crafted his delights, known in Turkish as lokum, with honey or molasses and flavored them with rosewater, orange or lemon. He then cut gels into small squares and covered them in powdered sugar. Turkish delight can still be purchased in rosewater, orange and lemon today as well as in other imaginative flavors including sour cherry, hazelnut, cinnamon, apricot and ginger. Purveyors also became creative with the outside covering, substituting ground coconut, nuts or cream of tartar for the original powdered sugar, and adding pistachio or almond pieces to the filling to lend the sometimes cloying dessert less intensity. The confection can be now purchased with a ""cream"" base -- imagine a slightly firmer version of marshmallow fluff. Turkish delight can be found throughout the city but is particularly abundant in the Spice Bazaar, where stall owners pile high pounds of the treat and offer samples to prospective buyers. Aladdin, located in the Spice Bazaar, sells an especially fine sampling (be sure to try the pomegranate with pistachios). For a more historic version, visit Haci Bekir, the confectionary started by Bekir Effendi. Mastica: To understand mastica, you have to go back to its roots. Its linguistic roots, that is. Mastica shares the same origin as the English word mastication, which means to chew. So it makes sense that mastica kind of tastes like mouthwash -- when you think of chewing, you think of eating, and that makes you think of the need for minty clean breath, right? Mastica isn't so much a dessert as a flavoring that permeates a variety of Istanbul treats with a Pine-Sol-meets-spearmint-gum kind of taste. Turkish delight is flavored with it; so are puddings and hard candies. While its taste may be acquired, it's certainly worth sampling to experience some true local dessert flair (and for its palate cleansing properties). Ficcin, a small restaurant in the Beyoğlu neighborhood near the Pera Palace hotel where Agatha Christie wrote ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" sells a mastica pudding that provides a keenly concentrated burst of the flavor. Baklava: Most nations in the Middle East claim baklava as a national treat, but Turks take particular pride in the dessert, dating it back to the Ottoman Empire. Made from flaky phyllo pastry layered with pistachios and drenched in honey, millions of tourists and locals alike are addicted to the intermingling of the flaky pastry with the density of the nuts. While baklava is widely available throughout Istanbul, a baklava emporium that opened in 1949 today routinely wins awards for having the best rendering of the treat. Situated near the waterfront on the European side, Karaköy Güllüoğlu, sells tens of thousands of pieces of baklava a day to loyal customers, some of whom have frequented there for more than 50 years. The shop sells not only the traditional baklava recipe but also variations that include peanuts and walnuts, as well as one made with chocolate. After purchasing some baklava, make sure to stay awhile and eat inside at one of the tall tables (you'll need to stand at those) or one of the regular tables outside. Either way, watch the crowds of locals treasuring the decadent treat -- men in suits on their way to work, children speaking rapid Turkish and pulling on their mothers' sleeves as they beg for one more piece. And as you take a bite of this buttery, luscious dessert, know that its distinct combination of lightness and intensity is not just delicious. It's also the essence of Istanbul.","Istanbul, at the crossroads of history, is also a hub for sweet confections .

Cut Spending by 10 Percent Why it's important: The median pay raise for 2010 is expected to be around 3 percent (the lowest forecast in 25 years). So challenge your family to give your budget a 10 percent raise by cutting your spending 10 percent. Do this now: Once you input your income and outflow into the Expense Sheet on my Web site, print it out and circle every expense that is a want (not a need), then figure out how to reduce or eliminate it. Oprah.com: Cut spending and create an emergency stash . Step 2: Find hidden savings . Shop for Insurance Deals Why it's important: You're always looking for the best prices -- why not on home and auto insurance, too? You're nuts if you don't comparison shop for auto insurance; you could save 10 percent or more. (But don't reduce your level of coverage. You want the right coverage for the best price.) Do this now: Go to InsWeb.com and NetQuote.com to find premium quotes from a variety of home and auto insurers. (For auto quotes from Progressive and GEICO, go to their Web sites.) Raise Your insurance deductibles Why it's important: Low deductibles of $250 or so can entice you to make claims for small-ticket items. Do that too often and your insurer may boost your premium or boot you completely. And there's a nice payoff for a higher deductible: Raise your auto and home deductibles to $1,000 or more and your premium cost falls at least 10 percent. Do this now: Call your current insurer and ask for a new quote based on a higher deductible. (But do this only if you have an emergency savings fund that can cover the cost of the deductible. Don't have that emergency fund set up? Grrr. See Build Security.) Check out a credit union Why it's important: Credit unions are often a better deal than banks and tend to pay higher yields on deposits. Do this now: Go to FindaCreditUnion.com and look for one that is part of the federal insurance program run by the National Credit Union Administration (go to NCUA.gov and click on Consumer Share Insurance Information and Tool Kit to check). Coverage is the same as at an FDIC bank -- $250,000 per person per credit union is fully insured, and additional coverage is based on the types of accounts you hold. Challenge your property-tax assessment Why it's important: Your tax is typically a percentage of your home's assessed value. If that assessment doesn't reflect today's market -- home values are down an average of 30 percent since the 2006 peak -- you may be overpaying. The National Taxpayers Union reports that more than half of all assessments are too high. Do this now: Contact your county tax assessor to learn how to challenge your assessment. TheNational Taxpayers Union also has a booklet on the topic. Step 3: Build Security . Boost emergency fund to cover 8 months of living expenses Why it's important: By now I am sure you have started saving. The next step is to keep at it until you have at least eight months' worth of living expenses. Do this now: Go to MyFDICInsurance.gov for banks and NCUA.gov for credit unions to verify that your emergency fund is tucked away at an institution that is federally insured. Never invest your emergency savings in the stock market. Safe, not sorry, is all that matters. Get the maximum 401(k) match at your current job Why it's important: If you left it to your company to auto-enroll you in the plan when you were hired, there's a good chance your contribution rate is too low to max out on the match. Do this now: Call your human resources department or the company that runs your plan; boost your contribution so you qualify for the max match. Roll over 401(k)s from former employers into an IRA Why it's important: Once you leave a job, you can move your 401(k) to a brokerage or fund firm. You can roll over 401(k)s from multiple jobs into one new IRA; that's a great bookkeeping assist. An IRA rollover also frees you up to invest in low-cost funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), stocks, and bonds. Do this now: If you don't yet have an account at a discount brokerage or no-load mutual fund company, pick one and then ask for its IRA rollover kit. Fund a Roth IRA Why it's important: After you max out on the company match in your 401(k), turn your retirement investing attention to funding a Roth IRA. In 2010 the maximum is $5,000 ($6,000 if you're 50 or older) for individuals with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) below $105,000 and married couples filing a joint return with MAGI below $167,000. Reduced contributions are phased out for individuals once MAGI hits $120,000; for married couples, eligibility disappears with MAGI above $177,000. Do this now: Don't get thrown by high minimums. Ask if there is a program that lets you invest small monthly sums of $50 or so. Sign on for an auto-investment plan and you may get around the advertised ""initial minimum investment."" Leave your retirement funds alone Why it's important: Can't handle the mortgage? That's no reason to raid your retirement funds. When that money runs out, you'll still face foreclosure, but you'll have lost your retirement savings, too. Do this now: Don't cash out your 401(k) when leaving a job. In addition to an early withdrawal penalty (if you're under age 55), your shortsightedness will cost you future gains. Go to MoneyChimp.com and click on the Calculator tab. Under ""current principal,"" input the value of your 401(k). Leave ""annual addition"" blank. For ""years to grow,"" enter the difference between your age and 65. For ""interest rate,"" use a conservative 5 percent. Calculate the future value. The difference between that and the current value is what you'd give up by cashing out. Convert to a Roth IRA Why it's important: As of January 1, anyone can convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA (previously there was an income limit). The advantage is that money in a Roth can be withdrawn in retirement with no tax due. Withdrawals from traditional IRAs will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. Do this now: Convert in 2010 and you can spread your tax bill over the next two years. If you have both deductible and nondeductible traditional IRAs, ask a CPA to determine your tax liability.

"(CNN) -- Britney Spears is now single and ready to mingle -- maybe even on Tinder. The 32-year-old pop star has had a very public breakup from ex-beau David Lucado in recent weeks, and has joked about being back on the hunt for ""hot guys.""

""But the best thing about your boyfriend cheating on you is that you get to go on another first date."" Britney Spears kicks off Las Vegas casino residency . When Spears appeared on Jimmy Fallon's ""The Tonight Show"" on Tuesday, the late-night host decided to help a girl out. ""Here at 'The Tonight Show,' we're all about making love connections. So before the show you did something cool: you let us sign you up for the dating app Tinder,"" Fallon told a bewildered Spears. ""This is real, we made a profile for you and everything.""

"(CNN) -- Before women gained the right to vote in 1920, Besse Cooper joined the suffrage movement. Then 24, the Georgia school teacher registered women to vote and spoke to others about the importance of having a voice in politics. Cooper voted in every election after the 19th Amendment was passed, save for two. She died Tuesday, at age 116, only one of eight people recognized by the Guinness World Records to have lived that long. Her son Sidney said his mother had her hair done Tuesday morning by a stylist at the assisted-living center where she had lived for the past 11 years but began to have trouble breathing. She died later in her room, peacefully, he said. When asked for her secret to a long life, Cooper told the Guinness website earlier this year: ""I mind my own business. And I don't eat junk food."" Sidney Cooper, 77, said his mother was a strong, determined woman who, like the school teacher she was, could be a disciplinarian. She was fair and honest, he said, but ""when she said something needed to be done, you'd better do it."" Besse Cooper was born in Sullivan County, Tennessee, on August 26, 1896. She began to go to school at age 5 -- yes, she walked from a log cabin -- to make sure one of her brothers attended. She grew to love going to class and eventually went to East Tennessee Normal School (now East Tennessee State University) in Johnson City to study education. When she graduated, she got a job earning $35 a month. When she heard from a friend she could make more in Georgia, she got a job in Monroe making twice as much. She married Luther Cooper in 1924, and he died in 1963. She never remarried. Sidney Cooper said his mother always said her best years were when she was in her 80s. He will always remember her with her straw hat on, working in the flower garden, scratching weeds away with her hoe. She always had fresh-cut flowers in her home, and in her later years, her family would bring some to her room. She also loved to watch the news on television, her son said. ""She was very intelligent,"" Sidney Cooper said. ""She loved to read."" Her eyesight had deteriorated, though, and she no longer read the Bible or any of the great works of fiction. Aside from a few heart issues, she was in ""amazing"" health, her son said, adding that she never complained of pain even in her final days. Besse Cooper gained the distinction of being oldest living human from Guinness World Records in January 2011. She briefly moved to second on the list when the record keepers found a woman in Brazil who was 48 days older, but Maria Gomes Valentim died in June 2011, just weeks before her 115th birthday. The oldest person to have ever lived, according to Guinness World Records, was Jeanne Louise Calment. She died in southern France in 1997 at the age of 122. As for her voting record, Besse Cooper didn't vote this year. Neither she nor her husband voted in 1948. They thought Thomas Dewey was a shoo-in. Besse Cooper is survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren and two great-great grandchildren.","NEW: Besse Cooper was one of the first women to vote in Georgia, helped sign others up to cast ballots .

"(CNN) -- You've likely heard of a ""flesh-eating bacteria"" hitting Florida and other states this summer. While the bacteria are real, public health officials say the ""flesh-eating"" part is not. Vibrio vulnificus is a naturally occurring bacterium that lives in warm saltwater and infects humans through the consumption of undercooked shellfish and skin wounds. Four infections have been reported in Texas so far this year, along with 13 in Florida, six in Maryland and 10 in Mississippi. In extreme cases, the bacteria can lead to blood infections (half of which are fatal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), possible amputation and blistering skin lesions. Only bacteria classified as group A strep are technically ""flesh-eating,"" says Rajal Mody, a medical epidemiologist in the CDC's Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases. The dozen species of Vibrio bacterium known to cause disease in humans are not in this group but do account for an estimated 80,000 illnesses, 500 hospitalizations and 100 deaths each year in the United States. The difference is that flesh-eating bacteria attack the bands of tissue that surround muscles, nerves, fat and blood vessels. Vibrio vulnificus, on the other hand, gets into the blood stream from either the skin or intestinal tract, and can damage organs and cause skin lesions that may appear similar to the skin damage caused by strep A, Mody says. Vibrio vulnificus multiplies in warmer water temperatures and tends to reach peak levels in midsummer, according to Mody, so the higher bacteria count coincides with the height of beach season. This adds to the public's fear of the bacteria. After all, no one wants to get a limb amputated while on vacation. ""The important thing to remember is that these infections are rare,"" Mody says. The CDC estimates that nationwide there are 95 Vibrio vulnificus cases each year, including 85 hospitalizations and 35 deaths. And typically the bacteria are only a summer health hazard, with 85% of infections occurring between May and October. Most at risk for severe illness and death from Vibrio vulnificus are people with a weakened immune system or who suffer from chronic liver disease, Mody says. Milder symptoms caused by this bacteria include diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain. Some people might not show any signs of infection. Two parasites found in contaminated water, Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia, can also cause similar symptoms, according to the EPA. Still, shooting that raw oyster or cutting your foot on a shell during your beach vacation shouldn't be taken lightly. If you experience symptoms a few hours or days after eating shellfish or being exposed to coastal water, seek medical attention immediately. ""Rapid treatment is really critical,"" Mody says. ""If someone is eating raw oysters, especially in a high-risk group, or is swimming in the ocean and notices skin lesions that are worsening quickly, it is important to get early treatment. Mortality rates increase if treatment isn't started on the first day of symptoms."" For those concerned about the safety of their summer vacation spot, states that typically report the most infections are Florida, Texas and Maryland. In 2013, the Florida Department of Health reported 11 deaths and 41 infections. Texas reports 15 to 30 annual cases, while Maryland state officials say they see an average of 25 infections per year. California took action in 2003 to reduce health risks by implementing a regulation to restrict the sale of raw oysters harvested from the Gulf Coast during warmer months when the bacteria count tends to be higher. In a review published in 2013 by CDC and the California Department of Public Health, researchers found that this action was strongly correlated with the reduction of deaths and illness. Mody says based on the data, it can be assumed that oysters harvested in the Gulf of Mexico between April and October have the highest levels of the bacteria. In addition to avoiding raw oysters, the CDC also recommends wearing gloves when handling raw shellfish and thoroughly cooking it, and discarding closed-shell varieties that don't open after cooking. For visitors to the beach or bay, if you have an open wound or broken skin, avoid exposure to warm salt or brackish water if you're in a high-risk group. Arkansas girl battles brain-eating amoeba .

"(CNN) -- If you live in the South, you probably know not to ask for a mustard-based BBQ sauce in North Carolina and you'd never, ever think of using soap on your cast-iron skillet. But even if you call some corner of the South ""home,"" you might not know how to properly shuck an oyster, prepare the perfect wedding toast or start a fire. It won't be held against you -- but bless your heart -- you might consider picking up a copy of ""The Southerner's Handbook,"" a new book from the editors of Garden and Gun magazine. With a name inspired by a long-gone late-night club in the magazine's hometown of Charleston, South Carolina -- ""the Studio 54 of the South,"" as editor David DiBenedetto put it -- Garden and Gun isn't just about gardens or guns. Nor is the magazine and its new book directed solely toward Southerners. More than 40% of the magazine's readership is based above the Mason-Dixon line, he said. It's about the culture, people and places that make the South -- well -- Southern, with a strong sense of sophistication the region has earned. ""The Southerner's Handbook"" is billed as a ""guide to living the good life"" and features illustrations, tips and tricks to help readers embrace Southern living. Yet despite the magazine's predilection for all things Dixie, DiBenedetto says transplants to the South -- no matter where they hail from -- can benefit from flipping through the handbook's pages. Here's what DiBenedetto, a native of Savannah, Georgia, had to say about the book and modern Southern culture. CNN: Why a handbook? DiBenedetto: The South is a vast place with pockets of culture that are really different from each other. If you're in the low country, you better know how to shuck an oyster. If you're in the Appalachian mountains, you better know when to find ramps. When it's Mardi Gras, you're gonna need to know how to avoid any throw up flying off a balcony. There are so many nuances to different parts of the South. So many traditions and passions, there are a lot of great skills that get passed down. The South has an unbelievable natural bounty; we've developed a set of skills to address that bounty. CNN: For someone who's never been to the South, or is new here, what does it mean to be a Southerner? DiBenedetto: It means to have pride in place; it means to be connected to the land and to understand that land. So much of the book is a bit of tutorial, but it's also about telling great stories. It's about bringing people to the table, about having conversations. Food is a leveler, and Southern food unites us in so many ways. CNN: The topics addressed seem to range from outdoorsy -- the fastest way to start a fire -- to pretty sophisticated -- how to talk Faulkner. Is that what a Southerner is? DiBenedetto: Around here we call it high and low. A Southerner is at home in a BBQ shack in the middle of nowhere ... and at the same time dressed in style in a black tie event. The South is these juxtapositions of high and low. To bridge the gap you have to experience them, you've gotta be open to going to the middle of nowhere to a small BBQ shack in Mississippi. You have to be open to experience, open to listen to the folks that have experience, tradition and skills. If you're willing to listen and learn, it's all there for you. CNN: How could a transplant benefit from the handbook? DiBenedetto: There is an unbelievable amount of details and information (in the book.) If you're at a party and there's football on, the book addresses great SEC football rivalries and why they're important. You'll also learn the difference between mustard and vinegar based BBQ sauces. There's a lot to take away . CNN: Why is it important that someone new to the South understand these two things? DiBenedetto: I think it lets you get in on the conversation; it lets you in on the party. To understand why the Alabama-Auburn game, which has been going on since the late 1800s and was postponed for a number of years because the rivalry was so intense, helps you understand how far football goes back in the South and what it means to football fans. The same way with pepper vinegar versus mustard sauce. It helps understand place, and so much of what the book is about is understanding place and tradition. CNN: How can already established Southerners use this book to up their game? DiBenedetto: This being such a vast place in terms of different cultures and geography, there's plenty to learn. There's so much variety in the South and a variety of skill sets, even a Southerner would find plenty to enjoy in the book. CNN: There are phrases like ""Bless your heart"" that mean something else entirely when said a certain way. What are the best phrases to learn that are genteel, yet communicate something deeper? DiBenedetto: The go-to is ""Bless your heart"" and how that can be said with tone or the way someone cuts theirs eyes. A Southern woman can say so much with the way she cuts her eyes when she says something. There's a section of the book where we talk about the proper way to say goodbye. At the end of an evening the host might say ""Well, this has been a fun time."" It means what it sounds like -- it's been fun, but it's over now. While that's not very Southern, it's the Southern way to say ""Get out of the house."" CNN: Given the heat and humidity, clothing in the South can be as much about fashion as it is about function. Which wardrobe choices help beat the heat but still help maintain a Southern sense of style? DiBenedetto: Seersucker. There's a danger of overdoing seersucker, but if you've gotta look stylin' you can impart just enough Southern sense of style, and it's still good for a hot climate. CNN: What are the three things any self-respecting Southerner should have on hand for impromptu entertaining? DiBenedetto: Bourbon, proper seating and deviled eggs. CNN: Mastering all of the topics in the book seems a little intimidating, are there a few every transplant and Southerner should master? DiBenedetto: Food and drink are so important to Southern culture. And understanding why is important. There are great recipes in the book and stories about food. Those two chapters are core. Southerners love to have a good time, they're not afraid to have a good time. A lot of that centers around food and drink. We have parties where you bring out your grandmother's pimentos cheese or deviled eggs and it's about that tradition. Good food and drink leads to great stories. To master some of these basics is to be able to be in the conversation. To know what a cat head biscuit is and know how to make it, to understand why we crave and lust after the perfect fried chicken. Knowing that stuff gets you closer to the traditions and the passions and the people and the land.","The magazine Garden and Gun released ""The Southerner's Handbook: A Guide to Living the Good Life""

"(CNN) -- For Kei Nishikori, ""Project 45"" has transformed into ""Project 10."" The former was the 23-year-old's mission to topple the highest tennis ranking ever held by a Japanese male, Shuzo Matsuoka, who hit world No. 46 back in July 1992. Nishikori smashed through that particular barrier towards the end of 2011 and has enjoyed a formidable few years on Tour, beating the likes of Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer. Japan's rising son now sits in the lofty position of world No. 11 -- his highest ever ranking -- and is tantalizingly poised to gatecrash the top 10. But with success comes expectation. This surge towards the game's pinnacle has elevated Nishikori to rock star-like status in his home country, its population clamoring for their first ever grand slam champion. ""I try not to think too much because if I start thinking then I feel pressure myself,"" Nishikori told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I think people have started thinking about me winning a grand slam or getting to the top ten but it might take some time. ""I sometimes feel the pressure from a lot of things -- my team, my country, my fans -- but you have to handle it well. ""My next goal is to win a grand slam. Hopefully I can do it someday."" Shot maker . A first major could be around the corner if famed tennis coach Nick Bollettieri is to be believed. Nishikori left Japan for Bollettieri's Florida academy aged just 13 without a grasp of English, but the intensive work on his game bore fruit within five years as he lifted his first ATP Tour title in Delray Beach. According to the man who has coached a phalanx of the game's greats like Andre Agassi, Monica Seles, Boris Becker and the Williams sisters, Nishikori is ""a shot maker."" Bollettieri told CNN. ""When he's on, he can beat anybody in the world."" Djokovic and Federer can testify to that. Both victories served as proof Nishikori has what it takes to prosper at the game's top table. Career landmarks . In 2012 he became the first Japanese player to reach the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in 80 years and then went on to win the Japan Open -- the first home-grown talent to do so in the tournament's 41-year history. He may have lost to eventual champion Rafael Nadal in the fourth round at this year's French Open, but he was the first Japanese player to get to that stage since 1938. Nishikori clearly relishes testing himself against the best players of what is widely regarded as a golden generation. ""I love to play against the top ten guys,"" he said. ""Beating Roger this year and beating Djokovic two years ago -- that is why I am playing tennis, to play those top 10 guys and to beat them. ""I still haven't beat Rafael Nadal or Andy Murray, there are more challenges to come to play those guys."" At world No. 11 he is the highest ranked Asian male player by a distance -- the next in line is Yen-Hsun Lu from Chinese Tapei in 60th -- and Nishikori wants to blaze a trail like Li Na who won China's first ever grand slam at the women's French Open in 2011. ""I am trying to get to be the most successful player in Asia,"" Nishikori added. ""In tennis not many players get to the top 10 -- I think only a few in the past. ""It's still weird for me to think I'm the number one player in Asia, because when I was young I couldn't think I'd be the number one player in Japan or even Asia. ""But now I am and I have to receive it in my mind, my dream is coming and hopefully I can go further. I think Li Na did a great job. Hopefully I can be the first one to lead the young guys."" Fed hero . Nishikori still refers to Federer, whose elegance while accumulating his 17 major titles has seen him described as the greatest the game has ever seen, as his idol. No wonder then that Nishikori joked he'd need a couple of days to celebrate after achieving one of his career goals by beating the Swiss at the Madrid Masters in May. Federer's dominance of men's tennis was ingrained by the time Nishikori turned professional, but prior to that it was Matsuoka he was desperate to emulate. ""I have two heroes,"" he explained. ""The first one is Shuzo Matsuoka, he was the first (successful Japanese player) -- he was the best tennis player in Japan. ""And Roger Federer. Still now, even though I love to see him play I think he is really the champion of tennis history."" 'Project 45' Nishikori's rise saw a swell of optimism that he could be a pioneer for tennis, hence the 'Project 45' hype as he edged towards usurping Matsuoka's ranking. ""Project 45 was no pressure for me -- I was just playing tennis for my hobby,"" he said. ""My first goal after turning pro was to get into the top 100 and after to be 45. It was one of my goals to be number one tennis player in Japan, and now I am ranked No. 11 in the world. ""To get to the top 10 is my next goal. It's not going to be easy to get there -- hopefully this year -- but I am getting close."" Rock star status . Like Matsuoka, Nishikori has come to understand what being Japan's sole representative inside the top 120 means -- fame and adoration. Much like Andy Murray who has had to carry the hopes of the United Kingdom on his shoulders, Nishikori has the same weight of responsibility, but answers to double the amount of people. ""I go back to Japan about three or four times a year,"" he explained. ""I get to go back to my home town and, yes, people do recognize me on the streets. ""It's not easy sometimes; you don't get to relax but at the same time I still try to enjoy the moment. Not many people can feel that way -- I love to stay in Japan, I really enjoy it when I go back."" Not for a second does he begrudge the accoutrements that his success in the game has delivered. He's just a boy made good from Shimane acting out his hobby on the global stage. ""For me, playing tennis was always my hobby, I am a lucky guy,"" he said. ""It was something I loved. It is something that can make you mad or crazy sometimes but it is something you love and not many guys can do your job. ""I try to enjoy this moment and this life -- it is not going to be a long time, 10 to 20 years, so I'm going to work hard.""","Kei Nishikori is the highest ranked Japanese male tennis player in the Open era .
The 23-year-old has climbed up to now be ranked world number 11 .
He has beaten the likes of Roger Fereder and Novak Djokovic in recent seasons .

"(CNN) -- The mother of South African model Reeva Steenkamp expressed ""disbelief"" over dismissal of murder charges against the man who killed her daughter. A judge found Oscar Pistorius guilty Friday of culpable homicide, which is akin to negligent killing. The conviction came a day after Judge Thokozile Masipa cleared him of murder -- premeditated or otherwise -- in Steenkamp's death. In her first comments since the verdict, June Steenkamp said Pistorius got off too easy for her daughter's killing. ""I just don't feel like this is the right sentence ... they believe his story, and I don't believe that story,"" June Steenkamp told NBC News. She said she was not ready to talk to Pistorius during the trial, but wants to meet him now in private. ""This verdict is not justice for Reeva, I just want the truth,"" she told NBC News. Pistorius, 27, has always admitted firing the bullets that killed Steenkamp, 29, his girlfriend at the time of the shooting on Valentine's Day last year. He has maintained he thought there was an intruder at the house. ""She died a horrible death, a horrible, painful, terrible death and she suffered, you know? I can't believe that they believe that it was an accident,"" June Steenkamp said. 'Don't care what happens to Oscar' During the trial that lasted about six months and transfixed the world with its grisly details, Pistorius pleaded not guilty to murdering her, saying it was a tragic mistake. Masipa said she believes Pistorius did not intend to kill his girlfriend. He thought he was defending himself from an intruder, she said while issuing the verdict Friday. There is no minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law, so it will be up to the judge to decide. He's free on bail until his sentencing starts on October 13. ""I really don't care what happens to Oscar,"" June Steenkamp said. ""It's not going to change anything because my daughter is never coming back. He's still living and breathing and she's gone, you know, forever."" 'No victors' Shortly after the verdict, Pistorius' uncle said they were relieved that he was convicted of a lesser charge. However, there were ""no victors"" in the case, Arnold Pistorius said. ""It won't bring Reeva back, but our hearts still go out for her family and friends,"" he said. Pistorius' uncle declined to comment further, citing respect for the victim's family. Gun charges . Pistorius' verdict also dealt with three other charges, all weapons-related. Pistorius was found not guilty of two -- a car sunroof shooting incident and illegal possession of ammunition found at his house after Steenkamp's shooting. The judge found Pistorius guilty of the third: a charge involving a shooting at a restaurant. The maximum penalty for that is five years behind bars. But he could get a lesser sentence, such as a fine or the loss of his gun license. There were no fatalities in the sunroof and restaurant shootings. Dismissal of murder charges . Masipa said the prosecution failed to prove its case that Pistorius and Steenkamp argued on the night of the killing, and that the Olympic track star shot her in a rage through a closed toilet door. Testimony of neighbors who said they heard shouting, screaming and shots was not persuasive, the judge said. She believed media coverage had contaminated testimonies, and neighbors' stories did not match the timings on phone records the night of the killing. Before the shooting, Pistorius was admired worldwide for competing against able-bodied athletes in the 2012 Olympics despite having his lower legs amputated at a young age.

"(CNN) -- While some experts expected 2013 would be the year that Florida's population edged out New York's, the Empire State barely held its spot as the nation's third most populous, according to data released Monday by the U.S. Census Bureau. While Florida continues to trail New York slightly, the updated numbers show the population gap closing. The two states are separated by about 100,000 people. Last year, New York had about 250,000 more people than Florida. New York's population is 19.65 million, according to the 2013 estimates, and Florida's is 19.55 million. ""This has been going on for many years, it's not a recent phenomenon,"" said Stan Smith, population program director at the University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research (BEBR). ""After many years of higher growth, Florida is now poised to overtake New York within the next couple of years."" Smith predicted the two states would trade places in the population ranking next year. Andrew Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College in New York, had predicted before Monday's report that the event would likely occur this year. ""It will pass next year, the next time these are done,"" Beveridge said Monday. ""If it doesn't pass, it means there will be a change in pattern."" The U.S. population is a little more than 316 million, up an estimated 2.25 million since 2012, according to the report. The most recently released census data fall in line with long-term trends, Beveridge said. Southern and Southwestern states continue to gain relative to those in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. The data also show that growth patterns are returning to normal after the financial crisis, which temporarily slowed growth in Florida and other states, Beveridge said. From April 2010 to July 2012, Florida's population grew about 2.7%. In the same period, New York's grew only 1%. The national growth rate for the period was 1.7%. While New York City and its surrounding suburbs, the Albany area, and Ithaca are all growing, much of upstate New York is experiencing declines in population, Beveridge said. Manufacturing jobs have diminished in northern New York cities like Rochester, Buffalo and Syracuse. Florida, on the other hand, is seeing a jump in tourism, real estate, construction, medicine and finance. But immigration is also an important factor in explaining Florida's rise. ""Florida's growth for many years has been due primarily to migration,"" Smith said. ""Typically, 80 to 90% of growth in the state has to do with people moving in."" The spike in migration includes people moving from other states as well as from abroad, Smith said. Based on responses to BEBR surveys, Smith said, most people moving to Florida do so for job-related reasons. The state also draws retirees seeking a warmer climate. When Florida surpasses and continues to outpace New York in population, it will likely end up with more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives after the next official census, in 2020. After the last release of official census data, from 2010, New York lost two seats and Florida gained two. Both states now have 27 House members. California (38.33 million) is still far and away the most populous state, according to Monday's report. Texas, where an estimated 26.45 million people live, is second.","Census estimate: Florida, expected to overtake New York in population, remains No. 4 .

"(CNN) -- Internet giant Alibaba secured its place in history Thursday as the largest U.S.-listed initial public offering (IPO) of all time. Alibaba, which achieved more than $240 billion in gross merchandise volume last year -- more than that of Amazon and eBay combined -- has become one of the largest technology companies in the world. That Alibaba is a Chinese company has important implications and begs the question: Will China become the next Silicon Valley, a breeding ground for the next generation of technology giants? Silicon Valley has long led the world in the quality, quantity and diversity of technology startups it incubates. Companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp have flourished under Silicon Valley's mature and complete startup ecosystem, with its open and free market and culture and innovative environment. The picture is quite different in Asia where thus far, only a few large technology companies have emerged. Alibaba, Tencent and Xiaomi were not nurtured in a Silicon Valley type environment, but they are successful examples from the unique Chinese market. Opportunities . With more than 1.3 billion people, China is not only the world's largest country, but also its biggest consumer market. Home to a huge number of factories, manufacturers, suppliers and customers, China is also called the ""World's Factory."" This unique demand and supply environment helps reduce businesses' transaction costs and, indirectly, retail prices, creating a world of opportunities for entrepreneurs from China and abroad. Often called the ""Amazon of China,"" Alibaba's business model is in fact completely different from that of the online retail giant. Alibaba's Taobao is not in itself an online shop but an open eCommerce platform where millions of small businesses and suppliers can sell directly to individual or business customers. Unlike Amazon, which charges commissions on transactions, Alibaba does not incur administrative charges on sellers or buyers; instead, it offers sellers paid advertising opportunities that will allow their products to stand out among the thousands of others on the platform. Alibaba's success stems from its huge traffic and competitive retail prices. This competitive weapon piggybacks on another factor: Chinese customers are the most active online shoppers in the world, shopping an average of 8.4 times online each month, far outpacing American customers, who shop 5.2 times. Repeated transactions by these customers contribute significantly to a steady sales volume and to Alibaba's success in China. Everything to know about Alibaba . Challenges . Opportunities come with challenges. The greatest challenge for entrepreneurs in China is the protection of intellectual property. Taobao is flooded with defective and counterfeit products: 82% of products labeled with the Columbia brand on Taobao are fakes, and the brand has had to get up to 3,000 listings taken down a month. This is a rather unique problem in China, unlikely to be found in other parts of the world. Without a strong legal system, copyright infringement is becoming a natural tendency. Unless a product is very difficult to duplicate, it is likely to be copied in China. These skillful and efficient perpetrators make such convincing cloned products that they often surpass the original on many levels. In a way, this is stifling creativity and innovation -- innovations are being copied, rather than respected and protected. In addition, government policies such as taxation and embargoes may be changed or imposed at anytime, without reasonable explanation and without channels or methods of reverting the decision. Any such unexpected policy changes may have significant impact on businesses, and are interpreted as one of the biggest risk factors of doing business in China. Despite adequate talent and capital, the closed market prevents local businesses from competing globally. Business owners who are not Chinese or do not have local connections face a much greater risk of failure. Because of the reasons above, I don't believe it is realistic to compare China to Silicon Valley. Rather, it can be described as ""a separate world"" where one can thrive only with a good knowledge about the rules of the game. Alibaba is an example of a company that has achieved a ""cultural fit"" in China. But whether Alibaba or other homegrown Chinese technology companies can hold their place in the competitive global market, or surpass the Silicon Valley-bred giants, remains to be seen.

"(CNN) -- Jared Loughner's behavior was so disturbing that his father confiscated his shotgun and took to disabling his car every night to keep him home in the months leading up to an Arizona shooting rampage that left six people dead, according to investigative documents released Wednesday. Loughner's parents even went so far in the days and weeks before to tell their son he needed to get help ""(be)cause his behavior is, um, been not normal,"" his mother, Amy, told investigators, according to transcripts of recorded interviews by investigators. The documents reveal vivid details about the events leading up to and surrounding the January 8, 2011, shooting during a meet-and-greet with U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords outside a Tucson, Arizona, grocery story. Giffords, who was shot in the head, was among 13 people wounded in the shooting. 19 months after mass shooting, Giffords moves back to Tuscon . The statements by Loughner's parents were among the more than 2,700 pages of previously sealed documents released by the Pima County Sheriff's Department in response to a Freedom of Information requests filed by CNN and other news agencies. Loughner, 24, is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole after pleading guilty last year to 19 charges in exchange for the government not seeking the death penalty. Intern's memoir recalls Giffords shooting . Many of the details surrounding the rampage are well known, from the heroic efforts to save Giffords and others to the tackling of the gunman. But the documents shed light on Loughner's erratic behavior leading up the shooting, from fleeing from his father the morning of the shooting to his repeated effort to buy ammunition for a 9mm handgun that he ultimately used in the rampage. Loughner's parents told authorities that their son, who they described as a ""loner,"" took a turn following his dismissal from Pima County College months earlier -- after he posted a disturbing video online that officials described as threatening. Loughner's parents told authorities they took away his shotgun after college police warned them their son may be a danger to himself or to others. Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly: The new 'Bradys' of gun control . Efforts for ammo, tears at traffic stop . Her son never followed up on getting a mental health evaluation that was required for being readmitted to the college, Amy Loughner said. According to the documents, unbeknownst to his parents Loughner purchased a 9mm handgun sometime before Christmas 2010 and showed it off to a friend. On the morning of the rampage, he went to at least two Walmarts in an attempt to buy ammunition. He was turned away at one by an employee who told investigators that he was behaving strangely. ""I kind o' felt uneasy, to be honest with you,"" the employee was quoted as saying in the transcripts. At another Walmart, Loughner was described as friendly as he inquired whether there was a limit on the amount of ammunition he could purchase. ""And then I guess he asked for six boxes, seven boxes,"" an employee said. ""Rang them up. Checked his ID. Wasn't any problem. So I double-bagged it for him.' Tucson shooting survivor says she forgives Loughner, finds closure in guilty plea . Just hours before the rampage, Loughner broke down and cried to an Arizona Game and Fish officer when he pulled over for running a red light. ""It's bad for your health, you're gonna kill somebody, you're gonna kill yourself,"" Game and Fish Officer Alen Edward Forney told Loughner, according to the transcript of Forney's statements to investigators. ""I said, 'I'm not gonna write you a citation for this.' And when I said that to him, his face got kinda screwed up and, and he started to cry. ""That struck me as a little odd,"" Forney continued. ""So I asked him if he was OK. And he said, 'Yeah, I'm OK, I've just had a rough time and I really thought I was gonna get a ticket and I'm really glad that you're not.' "" But Forney was worried whether Loughner could drive safely. ""I again made sure that he was OK. I asked him ... three or four times. He was probably getting tired of me asking if he was OK,"" Forney said. ""He said yeah, he was fine. He was just heading home, it wasn't too far away and he'd be OK,"" Forney said. Two and a half hours later, Loughner opened fire on a crowd of people at an outdoor event where Giffords was greeting constituents. When Forney got home that night and heard about the shooting, he went online, he said. ""I opened up the Internet and there was his picture,"" Forney said. ""Man, my heart just went up in my throat."" About an hour after the traffic stop, Loughner returned to his parents' home in his 1969 Chevrolet Nova, his mother, Amy Loughner, told authorities. Photos: Victims of shooting in Arizona . When his parents asked him what was in his backpack, he ran out the door, his mother said. His father, Randy Loughner, dropped his coffee and ran after his son but couldn't catch him, the mother said. A short time later, a neighbor told them there were news reports Giffords had been shot. They later learned from authorities their son was believed to be the shooter. Shooting rampage . Kenneth Veeder, a bystander to the shooting, suffered a gunshot wound to the calf as he was talking to a family lined up to meet Giffords. Veeder, a Vietnam War combat officer who served three tours of duty, was wearing an Infinity Airborne shirt. ""I heard pop, pop, pop, pop,"" Veeder said. Loughner was running and knocked him down, he said. When Loughner was reloading his gun, one man grabbed him, and Veeder grabbed Loughner's gun that fell to the ground, Veeder said. Veeder wanted to reload the gun, but a woman talked him out of it. 2011: Remembering Tucson victim Dorwan Stoddard . ""She goes, 'You can't do that,' "" Veeder said in the transcript. ""The hell I can't -- because I would have shot him. That's how angry I was. It was a combat reaction,"" he said. Deputy Sheriff Thomas Audetat Jr. recounted how he arrested Loughner. He saw two or three people holding down Loughner on a sidewalk between a Safeway grocery and Walgreens. Audetat put his knee on Loughner's back and handcuffed him. A bullet had earlier grazed the left side of the head of one person holding down Loughner, Audetat said. Right behind him was a woman who was also a gunshot victim. Audetat searched Loughner. ""In his left front pocket, I found two magazines which I immediately observed to be for a Glock,"" Audetat said. ""I was not sure of the caliber at that point, but they were Glock magazines and they were both fully loaded."" Audetat also found a foldable knife with a 4-inch blade in Loughner's front pocket. Loughner said he was feeling hot, so the deputy removed Loughner's beanie and hooded sweatshirt. Audetat found Loughner wearing earplugs, and Loughner also stated several times that he pleaded the Fifth Amendment, documents said. ""At that point, he said, 'I just want you to know that I'm the only person that knew about this,'"" Audetat said. ""That was the only thing, pretty much, that he said to me almost all day.""

"(CNN) -- The battering that the U.S. image is taking in Egypt these days reflects that the sources of anger against America in the Middle East run deep. We're not the primary reason the Middle East is so screwed up. The Arabs themselves need to own up to that. Just take a look at Syria and Egypt. But we are still a big part of the story. Some extremist Muslims hammer us because they don't like Western values; others see the conspiratorial hand of America everywhere -- sucking the life out of Arab and Muslim independence, pride and dignity. But once you get away from the fringes, what you find is equally disturbing: Millions of Arabs and Muslims don't like us not because of who we are but because of what we do. It's our policies. And since those are unlikely to change anytime soon, there's a pretty good chance America will continue to lose the public image battle in the Middle East. And here's why: . Minds and hearts: We've always had it backwards. It's not hearts then minds at all. If you want to capture the imagination of people living in the Middle East and get them to warm to America, you don't play to their emotions first. It's as if a new pretty bow on a package with the same contents as ever is somehow going to help sell U.S. policy. It won't. First, capture people's minds, appeal to their cognitive self-interest and then their hearts will follow. That would require a significant readjustment of U.S. policy: The U.S. would have to be much tougher on Israel on settlements and practices such as land confiscation, closures and withholding tax revenues in the West Bank. The U.S. would have to be much fairer when it came to Palestinian issues, including supporting reasonable resolutions at the United Nations and taking positions in negotiations that really did try to find an equitable balance, instead of viewing reality through a pro-Israeli filter. The U.S. would still have a special relationship with our close Israeli ally, just not an exclusive one. The U.S. would have to be much clearer about standing up to human rights abuses in the Arab world and much tougher on the Arab kings where America is reluctant to offend its conservative allies. People know where and what their interests are. And if we want to improve our credibility, we'd need to find a fairer balance between theirs and ours on many issues. Values vs. interests: It's stunning testament to the American predicament in the Middle East that within two years of Hosni Mubarak's overthrow -- handled relatively well by the Obama administration -- we are being attacked for backing both Mohamed Morsy and the generals and criticized by just about everyone, even the secular opposition. You can pick your favorite culprit. The U.S. ambassador, Secretary of State John Kerry's yachting outing, Barack Obama's naivete about the Muslim Brotherhood or his softness toward the military. But none of them is the reason. We lost our footing in Egypt because the tension between our values and interests results in unpopular and inconsistent policies. We back the democratically elected Morsy government, even though it behaves in an undemocratic manner; and when the military intervenes and cracks down, shooting 50 people, we react mildly. To a great extent, these inconsistencies are a result of the chaos of Egyptian politics, but they also are related to our nation's wariness of change. When stability in the region has been the guiding principle for half a century or more, it's never easy to adjust, especially for the big power. Just look at Russia's Vladimir Putin and Syria's Bashar al-Assad. But more than that, if Egyptians are confused, can't get their own house in order and don't produce big leaders or credible democratic institutions on which the U.S. can find a focal point for its policy, we're going to continue to stumble and bumble around. We backed Morsy because we believe in the almighty ballot box. And we backed the generals because we have other interests -- the Eyptian-Israeli peace treaty, security for the Suez Canal, counterterrorism, containing Iran -- that commend supporting the military, too. That we couldn't reconcile the two in response to Egyptian realities should come as no great surprise. Nor should the reality that we earn the disfavor of so many frustrated Egyptians. Great power hypocrisy: Great powers are big and strong enough that they can afford to behave inconsistently and hypocritically. And they do. It's as if it were part of their job description. But that inconsistency can confuse and disappoint. Our policies toward the Arab Spring are laced with contradictions. We support real political change in Egypt, but we won't push it hard in Saudi Arabia or in Bahrain where oil, stability and U.S. bases reign supreme. We'll intervene militarily in Libya because it's easier -- but not in Syria, where the strength of al-Assad's allies, military and a chemical weapons capacity make it much riskier. And in the greatest paradox of all, our ties with the monarchies -- Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Morocco -- are much closer than with the emerging and struggling democracies at a time when the Middle East yearns for democracy and freedom. It is indeed remarkable that the Arab kings have become our new anchors in a turbulent sea of political change. Kerry has discovered Jordan as a key ally in this peace process policy. Earlier this year, the U.S. completed a huge arms sale to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates worth billions. Expectations for America run high in the world; and too often we help raise them, particularly in the Middle East. Obama came into office promising a new look in this region: more engagement, a greater sensitivity toward Islam and a pro-active policy on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. And it's a cruel irony that this putative transformer ended up tougher than his predecessor on drones and Iran and as cautious on Israeli-Palestinian peace. But governing is about choosing. And Obama chose willfully and wisely not to chase windmills abroad but to concentrate on trying to fix America's broken house. Coming off the two longest wars in American history, where the standard for victory was not whether we would win, but when we could leave, who could blame him. For Obama the middle class was always going to be more important than the Middle East. And for better or worse, America's standing in that region shows it.

"(CNN) -- In the digital era, finding ""the One"" often involves finding the one dating app that is best suited for an individual's lifestyle. Research shows that as society becomes increasingly plugged in, attitudes have shifted positively toward finding love online. Web dating is no longer associated with recluses hiding behind a computer screen. In fact, one in 10 Americans has used an online dating site or app, according to a 2013 Pew Research report on online relationships. With that shift, online dating has branched beyond algorithm-based matches to highly specific sites that can focus on any particular niche (even farmers have their own dating site). Wanted: A part-time lover . Enter Siren, a dating app created for women by women that puts the ladies in the driver's seat when it comes to shopping for an online connection. Women control who sees their image, who can communicate with them and what type of date to pursue. CEO Susie Lee and design director Katrina Hess created Siren based on the core principle that ""women needed to control visibility,"" Lee said, meaning the users can give clear signals that they're actually interested and comfortable talking to the suitor of their choice. As online dating options have grown, Lee noticed that her friends' frustration did, too: With every good introduction often came a slew of lewd ones. ""I just started looking (at online dating options) and very quickly realized how many things are out there and how immediately my 'creepy meter' went up,"" Lee said. The subject has come to a head as users, particularly women, have started publicizing complaints of unsolicited sexual advances online. The 2013 Pew Research online dating report found that 28% of online daters have been contacted ""in a way that made them feel harassed or uncomfortable,"" with 42% of female online daters experiencing this, compared with 17% of men. This year, comedian and Cracked writer Alli Reed created the ""world's worst dating profile"" on OkCupid to see how terrible an attractive woman would have to be to stop indecent introductions. OkCupid set up bad dates in 'an experiment' With snippets like ""I'm really good at convincing people I'm pregnant"" and ""my parents think I'm in law school so they pay all my bills"" alongside a model's photograph, she still managed to get her fair share of boorish messages. Artist Anna Gensler went so far as to draw artistic, nude interpretations of the off-color openers she received on Tinder and then sent them back to the sender. How Tinder picks your next match . Lee says the app is not meant to be the counterpart to the ""He-Man Woman Hater's Club"" but instead a place for women to control their images -- whether because they are in a high-profile position or to simply ward off objectification. Lee likens the visibility functionality to a real-world interaction in which a woman makes eye contact or smiles as a signal of interest to a potential suitor. If the suitor ends up untoward, she can toggle her visibility in the same way she could decline conversation in a social setting. ""The reason isn't necessarily that they needed more power over men; they needed to feel safe and have fun,"" Lee said. Here's how it works: When a user signs up for Siren, they're prompted to take an in-app photo to ensure that ""you really look and are like your profile,"" Lee said. Next, the user is prompted with an open-ended ""question of the day."" The female users will see all the men who responded that day; if a woman likes a man's take, she can either choose to make herself visible to him or save his profile to scope out future responses and get a broader sense of his personality. ""You're trying to make strangers less strange, and in order to do that, you have to put something of yourself out there,"" Lee said, adding that she hopes this gives a more complete, up-to-date personality portrait of a user than the typical profile list of likes and dislikes. On the flip side, a male user will see the female user's answers without seeing a profile picture. If his interest is piqued, he can hit an option to notify Siren. The app acts as a third party, alerting the woman that a user liked her answer and inviting her to check him out. The woman can ultimately decide to make herself visible. In addition, there's the namesake ""Siren"" call: A woman can express what she wants in real time -- whether it's drinks, a quick walk around the city or an activity hinted at with coy ellipses. ""Siren's touchstones always reference what I discern works in real life,"" Lee said. ""Give women the chance to send subtle cues of interest, men to show off a little of who they are, friends to recommend good men and people to make each other smile."" Siren is part of a growing trend of apps that aim to take control of the online lechery and worse: Hinge allows users to connect only with mutual friends and third-party connections on Facebook; Willow users must answer questions before showing pictures; Wyldfire allows female users to invite only the men who they would want in the dating pool. With Siren, there's also a vouching component: Women can forward a man's profile to friends for their opinion; ""wingwomen"" can sign on without a public profile so they can help their friends in their search. ""We're cheering good men on in as many ways as we can,"" Lee said. In beta testing, she says, some users submitted feedback that the functionality would be nice to have in other gender and sexuality groups, so they're working on a version for the LBGTQ community, as well. The app will launch its public version this week and will initially focus on the Seattle area, where the startup is based, before expanding nationwide.","Siren is a new dating app created ""for women by women""

"(CNN) -- Chris Brown has some words of advice for suspended NFL player Ray Rice. In an interview with MTV's Sway Calloway Thursday, Brown opened up about his own history with domestic violence in light of Rice being cut from the Baltimore Ravens and suspended from the league after a leaked video depicted the player punching his now-wife, Janay Rice. ""To Ray or anybody else, because I'm not better than the next man, I can just say I've been down that road,"" Brown told MTV News. ""I've made my mistakes too, but it's all about how you push forward and how you control yourself."" Brown infamously attacked his former girlfriend Rihanna in 2009 on the eve of the Grammy Awards, and was sentenced to a five-year probation and 1,400 hours of community service. ""It's all about the choices you do make,"" Brown told Calloway. ""I deal with a lot of anger issues from my past, not knowing how to express myself verbally and at the same time not knowing how to cope with my emotions and deal with them and understand what they were."" The 25-year-old R&B and hip-hop artist explains that therapy has been crucial in helping him better understand and grasp control of his feelings. ""I still talk to my therapist twice a week,"" he said. ""It helps me ... if I'm frustrated and I'm dealing with something, to vent and say what I'm going through so I can hear from an actual clinical person, 'This is how you should react,' or 'It's good to feel this way because feelings, emotions, and energy and emotions, are supposed to come and go. It's not supposed to stay there, you're not supposed to keep it inside, because it'll just bottle up and you'll become a monster.'"" The singer noted that due to his past, he's not in a position to pass judgment, but is simply speaking from his personal experience.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's national election day ended without any major incidents of violence, though tourists are reminded to keep abreast of the situation as anti-government protests are expected to continue in the capital, Bangkok. ""Bangkok and some parts of nearby provinces (Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani and Samut Prakan) remain under a state of emergency,"" says the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) in its latest update, issued February 2. The decree, called in response to anti-government protests in which at least 10 people have died since November, came into effect January 22 and will last 60 days. Under a state of emergency in Thailand, authorities can impose curfews, declare parts of the capital off-limits, censor the media and detain suspects without court permission. ""We strongly advise U.S. citizens to be alert and avoid protests, demonstrations, and large gatherings,"" says the U.S. Embassy in a recent warning to its citizens. ""While the ongoing protests have been generally peaceful, some have resulted in injury and death. The situation can change rapidly. It is important to pay attention to local news and media reports."" Tourists' mobility restricted . Despite the state of emergency, life carries on as normal in much of Bangkok and tourists will find it's easy to avoid the protests if they follow locals news reports. Currently the biggest issue facing visitors is mobility, as protesters have closed off six major Bangkok intersections and conduct regular marches to government buildings throughout the city. Several of these rallies, aimed at forcing Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office, have been in popular tourism areas, including Silom, Asok and the Ratchprasong intersection -- the latter a popular shopping area near major hotels such as the Four Seasons Bangkok, Grand Hyatt Erawan and InterContinental Bangkok. ""We are working hard to make sure there is as little impact on our guests as possible and we have full contingency procedures in place,"" said Nicola Chilton, Four Seasons Hotels' senior director of public relations, Asia Pacific. Currently, all hotels and malls in Bangkok remain open, though opening hours of shopping complexes near protest sites are subject to change. Major tourist attractions, including museums and temples, also remain open as of February 2. Transportation . In the runup to the planned mass Bangkok protests, the anti-government group stated it would not close Bangkok's two major airports, Suvarnabhumi -- the main international airport -- and Don Muang, which primarily serves low-cost carriers like AirAsia and Nok Air. The group also said it would allow ambulances to pass along any roads it blocked, and that it would not block access to public transportation. Tourists flying out of Bangkok are advised to leave for the airport four hours before their scheduled flight. All expressways currently remain open. The BTS Skytrain, MRT subway, Suvarnabhumi Airport Rail Link, public ferries and trains have also all been operating as normal. ""About 6,000 taxis registered with the Airports of Thailand have been given special stickers to show that the vehicles are carrying tourists, thus allowing them to be able to pass normally through intersections occupied by the demonstrators,"" says the TAT. Popular tourist destinations outside of Bangkok, including Phuket, Chiang Mai and Krabi, are unaffected by the protests. Where to stay . Travelers in Thailand wishing to avoid the protests should note that government rallies are no longer being held near Khao San Road, a popular tourist area filled with guesthouses and bars. Luxury riverside hotels, such as The Oriental, The Peninsula, Royal Orchid Sheraton, Shangri-La, Millennium Hilton and The Siam are also well away from protest sites. Tourist assistance . Thailand's Ministry of Tourism has reportedly set up tourism assistance centers at both Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang airports, where they'll coordinate with all concerned public and private agencies, including the Tourist Police, the Immigration Bureau, Metropolitan Police Bureau and the Thai Hotels Association. Help desks will also be set up at the Siam, Phaya Thai, Ekkamai and Wong Wian Yai BTS Skytrain stations as well as the Hua Lamphong MRT subway station.

"(CNN) -- Out of sight, out of mind. That's a mantra hotel guests tend to adopt as they tuck into rooms inhabited by hundreds of previous guests -- and possibly the microscopic germs and debris they leave behind. Best Western International on Thursday announced a new approach to cleaning those things visitors can't see. The chain said its aggressive cleaning program was inspired by research showing a lack of consumer confidence in cleanliness among midscale hotels. Starting this year, Best Western housekeepers will be equipped with ultraviolet sterilization wands to use on highly touched areas such as telephones, bathroom fixtures and light switches. UV black lights will be used during housekeeping inspections to detect biological matter and other particles, the chain said. Rooms will be outfitted with remote controls that are easy to clean or wrapped for cleanliness. Pillows, blankets and towels will be wrapped to show they're freshly cleaned. A microscopic look at hotel hygiene . Best Western plans to roll out the ""I Care Clean"" program throughout 2012 after pilot programs yielded increased guest satisfaction. ""We are unlocking the potential of the housekeeping profession by providing new tools and training to help ensure customer satisfaction, loyalty and ultimately trust,"" said Ron Pohl, Best Western senior vice president of brand management, in a statement. Howard Adler, a professor at Purdue University's School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, said he suspects Best Western's move was prompted by media reports of bodily fluids found on hotel surfaces. He said most hotel companies have excellent standards. ""In many cases hotel rooms are cleaner than peoples' (own) bedrooms or bathrooms,"" he said via e-mail. Enforcing standards of cleanliness can be a challenge though. ""Housekeeping personnel are often called upon to take heavy loads and adding additional components to the routine will probably not be the answer,"" he said. Solid training and a diligent follow-through are the most important factors to maintaining high housekeeping standards, Adler said. But new policies are sometimes adopted to calm guest fears. ""I relate this to homeland security. We are not any safer, but many people believe that we are,"" he said. What do you think? Is there a surefire way to eliminate germs? Do you really want to know what's in your room?","Best Western rolls out new cleaning procedures .

"(CNN) -- What a veteran traveler you are. You've already hiked up to Machu Picchu and climbed up and down the thousands of stairs of the Great Wall of China. We bet you've also stood awestruck before the Hagia Sofia and the Taj Majal. You're a regular Tony Wheeler, who co-founded Lonely Planet travel company more than 40 years ago. Like you, he's visited most of the world's major wonders and almost everything else worth seeing. Wheeler and fellow world explorer Vince Michael, head of the Global Heritage Fund, are always looking for hidden places to discover. By all means, they say, visit Angkor Wat and the Hagia Sophia. Go there and check them off your bucket list. But don't you want to explore places everyone hasn't already seen? That's why CNN asked Michael and Wheeler, a Global Heritage Fund board member, to pick some hidden gems to explore. These are spots where we hope you won't always share your trip with thousands of other travelers. ""Who hasn't seen pictures and read about Angkor Wat in Cambodia?"" Wheeler told CNN. ""But Banteay Chhmar? It's an unknown, and discovering an unknown is always a delight. ""Ditto for the Taj Mahal in India. Nobody's disappointed when they see the Taj for the first time, but they've seen pictures of it. It's popped up in TV programs and movies so often, that actually seeing it is no surprise. Hampi, however, is going to be totally unexpected."" Let the crowds swarm the world's best-known marvels. The lesser-known Global Heritage Fund sites below can be found in the same countries -- without the crowds. And two spots are still on Wheeler's bucket list. That's right: Even the co-founder of Lonely Planet hasn't yet been to these picks in India and Peru. Maybe you can beat him there. Some of the more undiscovered spots require long and bumpy bus rides through the mountains, while others are located near luxury hotels. No matter which you choose, they will knock your (hiking) boots off. Pingyao Ancient City, China . Called the ""Long Wall of Ten Thousand Li"" in China, the more than 20,000-kilometer Great Wall was built from the third century B.C. to the 17th century A.D. on China's northern border and is the world's largest military structure. Prefer to see a more complete picture of ancient Chinese life? Book a high-speed rail train ticket and take the 700-kilometer (435-mile) journey southwest from Beijing to Pingyao in just four hours. (The regular train trip can take anywhere from 10 to 14 hours.) Pingyao Ancient City is a stunning Han Chinese city from the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911). Nearly 400 of the 4,000 existing Ming- and Qing-era courtyard buildings are still intact, as is a 6-kilometer city wall. The city was a center for China's banking industry in the 19th and 20th centuries, and some of the imposing buildings are evidence of the city's wealth. ""Pingyao is such a magical place given the incredible urbanization in Beijing and Shanghai and the fact that every other Chinese city has lost its wall,"" says Michael. ""You really feel like you have stepped into the past."" 7 fascinating cities of destruction . Chavin de Huantar, Peru . Many visitors to Peru fly into Lima and hop on a quick flight to Cuzco to explore the 15th century Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu, perhaps the most stunning structure standing from the Inca empire. How about a site a few centuries older? One of the oldest cultures in Peru, Chavin de Huantar was a pan-Andean culture that thrived in the location of the same name between 1500 B.C. and 400 B.C. some 3,180 meters above sea level. The Chavin archaeological site, located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of Lima, seems to have been a religious and ceremonial pilgrimage center for the pre-Columbian Andean religious world. ""It is distinguished by a highly organized platform-mound-and-plaza architecture that includes precocious use of finely cut and worked stone facades as well as an intricate, graphic, baroque and instantly recognizable 'art' style executed in stone, pottery, bone, shell and gold,"" says Michael. ""It also represents one of the earliest manifestations of Shamanism, where power was legitimized through a belief in the small elite having a divine connection."" ""The monumental center of Chavin itself was clearly a very significant place, and its elaborate architecture places it among the most impressive temples of its time, anywhere in the world."" Take an eight-hour bus ride from Lima to the northern town of Huaraz, and it's another bumpy three-to-four hour bus ride from Huaraz to Chavin. Catalhoyuk, Turkey . Part of Istanbul's distinct skyline, the Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom) cathedral currently standing opened in the 6th century A.D. and is where rulers of the East Roman Empire were crowned. We prefer to explore Catalhoyuk, a 700-kilometer drive south from Istanbul, where lovers of ancient civilizations can find one of the earliest known towns in the world. Catalhoyuk is a nearly 10,000-year-old example of a well-preserved Neolithic town, showing how humans moved into sedentary life, organized themselves and developed a culture. It contains some of the world's earliest known mural art and is considered central to the origin of civilization in the Middle East. It's an ancient agricultural community rather than a big site of temples, palaces and streets lined with columns, ""plus hardly any visitors,"" says Wheeler. ""Unlike the better known Greek and Roman sites of Turkey, this place is a bit of a mystery."" While the houses have evidence of lovely art and sculpture, the homes themselves are made of unfired mud brick and present a challenge for conservationists. UNESCO's newest World Heritage Sites . Hampi, India . One of the most well-known and admired structures and examples of Indo-Islamic architecture in the world, the Taj Mahal is a marble mausoleum built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor in memory of a beloved wife. A site of equal interest lies in the south of India at Hampi, the last capital of the last Hindu Kingdom of Vijayanagar. A six-hour drive from Goa or Bangalore, Hampi was conquered by the Deccan Muslim confederacy in 1565 and plundered before it was abandoned. Still standing are several temples, including the Krishna temple complex, the Chandramauleshwar Temple and the temples of Ramachandra and Hazara Rama. There are also hundreds of other remains on the site, including stables, water structures, shrines and royal complexes. ""Hampi is a stunning complex of magnificent temples and other structures set along a dramatic riverine site,"" says Michael, calling it ""a dramatic testament to one of the earth's oldest civilizations."" Banteay Chhmar, Cambodia . The temple of Angkor Wat is the best-known site at Cambodia's Angkor archaeological site, which also has the remains of several different capitals of the Khmer Empire from the 9th to the 15th centuries. Lesser known but rich in archaeological ruins, the temple complex of Banteay Chhmar (the Citadel of the Cats) in the northeast corner of Cambodia was commissioned by Khmer King Jayavarman VII (1181 A.D. -1219 A.D.). A three-hour drive from Angkor Wat, it's well-known for bas reliefs documenting the period's history. Looters got to many bas reliefs and other art in the 1990s, and the Global Heritage Fund wants to preserve the remaining art and the central temple complex and aid the local community in developing tourism. This is really ""a 'wow' site,"" says Wheeler. It has ""all the attractions from huge stone faces to intricately carved bas reliefs that you find at the crowded Angkor sites and no crowds at all.""

"Washington (CNN) -- New research suggests a high-calorie, high-protein diet may improve the outcome for some service members with brain injuries due to battlefield explosions. The Pentagon spends billions of dollars trying to detect and avoid improvised explosive devices in Iraq and Afghanistan, but traumatic brain injuries (TBI) have become an expensive and troubling legacy of the wars -- responsible for a variety of injuries and long-term problems for military service members. An Institute of Medicine report released Wednesday says improvements in nutrition may offer benefits just after a blast injury and calls for immediate changes. ""The committee strongly supports the provision of energy and protein to patients with severe TBI early after injury,"" the report says.  ""This important recommendation should be implemented immediately and will achieve significant positive outcomes by reducing the inflammatory response, which is likely to be at its height during the first two weeks after the injury."" The report calls for more research on the beneficial effects of other nutrients and suggests that a different diet before an injury also may have benefits. And researchers point out that changes in treatment and improvements in recovery would have an impact not just in war zones, but on athletic fields, highways and everywhere brain injuries occur. ""TBI is also a major health concern for the civilian population and the actual burden of TBI in the United States is underestimated,"" said John Erdman, chairman of the Institute's Committee on Nutrition, Trauma, and the Brain, in an introduction to the report. ""It is my hope that this report assists not only the Department of Defense in its goal to improve outcomes from TBI but also the public health community as a whole."" The report said TBI ""contributes to nearly one-third of all injury-related deaths in the United States, making it a major health concern for the civilian population as well."" ""According to recent estimates, between 1.6 million and 3.8 million sports-related TBIs occur annually, including those not treated by a health care provider,"" the report said. The Institute of Medicine is an independent, nonprofit organization that provides ""unbiased and authoritative advice to decision makers and the public,"" according to its website.  It was created in 1970 and is the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences.","Brain injuries are a significant cause of death and disability among service members .

"(CNN) -- Ukrainian security officials are complaining that unknown attackers are interfering with the mobile phone services of members of Ukraine's parliament, making difficult political decisions about what to do about Russia's incursion last week into Crimea that much harder. The head of Ukraine's security service said on Tuesday, ""I confirm that an IP-telephonic attack is underway on mobile phones of members of Ukrainian parliament for the second day in row."" This is reminiscent of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Georgia that preceded Russia's invasion of the country in August 2008. The attacks shut down several websites of Georgia's government including the president's. While the Kremlin denied any involvement, Georgian officials accused Russia of being behind the attacks. Of course, just as some states have exploited offensive cyber capabilities for their own purposes, so too has the United States. Cyberattacks are double-edged swords. Compared to mounting a conventional war they cost little in terms of blood and treasure. However, in the long run they may have larger unintended consequences if more and more nation states and even private groups use cyberwarfare capabilities. The Stuxnet malware that was discovered in 2010 showed the potential of cyberattacks. The joint U.S.-Israeli operation demonstrated how the nuclear enrichment facility of Natanz in Iran could be effectively disrupted using a cyberattack that interfered with Iranian centrifuges' capacity to enrich uranium. The level of sophistication of the malware was unprecedented and affected the facility even though it was ""air gapped"" -- disconnected -- from the public Internet. Last month came the news that Obama national security officials have debated since 2011 whether to target Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria with cyberattacks. The upside: No American boots on the ground and some potentially significant harm could be done to al-Assad's military capabilities. The downside: What about unknown risks? Might such attacks embolden Syrian allies like Iran and Russia to launch cyber-counterattacks against targets in the U.S.? The Stuxnet attack on Iran was not an isolated event. A January report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies points out that Iran ""is the likely source of a recent series of incidents aimed at Gulf energy companies, American banks, and Israel. The most important involved a major disruption involving the destruction of data on computers used by (oil giant) Saudi Aramco...."" The Syrian Electronic Army, a group that supports the al-Assad regime, showed the potential to undermine trust in the financial system when it hacked The Associated Press's Twitter account last year to falsely report an attack on the White House, which caused the Dow Jones to drop by 150 points. While technically not comparable to Stuxnet and its effect was only temporary -- the White House quickly refuted the reporting -- it nevertheless demonstrates the existence of a tool for shadowy organizations to influence events that did not exist before. These recent incidents underscore both the scope and the significant differences among cyberthreats: . -- The actions by the Syrian Electronic Army did not cause a physical effect; they changed data and the content of The Associated Press's reporting. -- The disruption at Saudi Aramco was due to the destruction of computer data, but it did not cause a physical effect either. --Stuxnet, on the other hand, had a physical impact making Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges spin at a rate they were not supposed to. The DDoS attacks that appear to be happening in Ukraine right now, and the type of cyberattack that the U.S. launched against Iran that could at some point happen in some other form against Syria, raise significant moral and legal issues. In many ways the cyberwarfare issue is akin to the issue of the use of armed drones, which greatly reduce the number of deaths that would result from a conventional armed conflict. Whoever launches a drone attack or a cyberattack pays no costs of the kind that would typically take place on a conventional battlefield. You can't shoot down a drone pilot or kill a computer technician launching some kind of cyberattack thousands of miles from the intended target. For this reason drones and cyber capabilities can also make conflict more likely as the barriers to entry to engage in either drone warfare or cyberconflict are so low. Moreover, there is a risk that the use of drones or cyber capabilities can escalate into a conventional armed conflict. Similarly to the case of armed drones, the United States has had a large lead in its ability to mount effective offensive cyberattacks, but that advantage is unlikely to last. And since the United States is the only superpower and among the most technologically advanced (as well as most vulnerable), it must lead by example and harden cybersecurity at home and contribute to international agreements to govern the use of these powerful new tools. These tools that will only get more powerful as the world becomes more connected and ever-more dependent on computers.","Ukrainian officials say phone services of members of parliament were targeted .

"Monrovia, Liberia (CNN) -- A red rope guarded by police marks the ""quarantine line"" around the West Point slum in the Liberian capital, Monrovia. Beyond it, more than 70,000 people are trapped -- angry, scared and increasingly hungry -- as authorities seek to halt the spread of the deadly Ebola virus. As soon as a CNN team crossed the line, it was swarmed by people desperate to be heard. Since the government designated the slum an Ebola quarantine zone last week, there has been no way out. Stuck without sanitation or running water, and with food supplies for many running low, people fear for their lives. The quarantine measures were imposed after rioters looted an Ebola treatment center in the slum, claiming the virus was a government hoax. A nurse at the center told CNN she arrived for her shift that night to find the center destroyed and not a patient to be found. The center is slowly being rebuilt, but it lacks basic equipment and facilities. Medical workers have to wash their protective gear for reuse and have little more than a squirt of bleach to rely on. 'I'm scared of everything' It is the only refuge for the slum's frightened residents. But the most that they can hope for is to be made comfortable while they wait either to overcome the virus -- or not. Like many residents of West Point, Charming Fallah, a hairdresser, has to travel out of the township to make a living. She is the only breadwinner for her two children and her elderly parents. ""Right now, my mother doesn't have anything,"" she told CNN. ""First, I was the one that provided for her. But as time goes by, she's complaining the rice is finished. I just came from my parents' house and she has nothing."" Asked if she is more scared by the disease or by hunger, Fallah replied: ""Both. That's what's worrying us. The hunger, the Ebola, everything. I'm scared of everything."" Her fears are far from unfounded. Experts have described the West African outbreak, centered in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, as the worst in the history of the virus. Doctors, nurses succumb . The World Health Organization said Monday that 120 health care workers have died in the Ebola outbreak, and twice that number have been infected. Public health experts say several factors are to blame, including a shortage of protective gear and improper use of the gear they do have. In a commentary released this week in the Annals of Internal Medicine, doctors from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, wrote that personal protective gear made to shield health care workers from Ebola-contaminated fluids isn't being used properly. The commentary says that even with the correct gear, a health care worker is at risk for infection if contaminated protective clothing is not removed correctly. The Ebola virus is transmitted through direct or indirect contact between bodily fluids from an infected patient; that's why taking off the protective gear correctly is essential. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University's School of Medicine, says following the proper sequence of removing protective gear can keep health care workers from infecting themselves. The sequence is simple. You start with the gloves, then take off the eye protection, gown and surgical mask. Follow up with washing your hands. Why is this particular sequence so important? ""Because if you leave your gloves on, and take off your eye protection first, you could pass the fluids from the gloves to your eye mucus,"" explains Schaffner. ""No matter where you are, no matter what day of the week it is, never change the sequence of how you take the equipment off."" One or two doctors per 100,000 people . The fact that the disease has killed so many people working to care for infected patients is making it increasingly hard to combat the virus in West Africa, WHO said. ""It depletes one of the most vital assets during the control of any outbreak. WHO estimates that in the three hardest-hit countries, only one to two doctors are available to treat 100,000 people, and these doctors are heavily concentrated in urban areas."" The threat can mean other health facilities close, as staff members choose to stay home rather than risk their lives. This means other medical needs, such as help with childbirth and malaria treatment, are neglected. ""The fact that so many medical staff have developed the disease increases the level of anxiety: if doctors and nurses are getting infected, what chance does the general public have?"" the group wrote. ""In some areas, hospitals are regarded as incubators of infection and are shunned by patients with any kind of ailment, again reducing access to general health care."" The heavy toll is also making it harder to secure support from sufficient numbers of foreign medical staff, the group said. Last week, a WHO health care worker was infected with Ebola in Sierra Leone. The organization has temporarily pulled its health workers from the Kailahun post and has sent a team to review the incident. ""This was the responsible thing to do. The field team has been through a traumatic time through this incident,"" Dr. Daniel Kertesz, a WHO representative in Sierra Leone, said in a statement. ""They are exhausted from many weeks of heroic work, helping patients infected with Ebola. When you add a stressor like this, the risk of accidents increases."" Blood and other bodily fluids . Ebola is one of the world's most virulent diseases and is transmitted through direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids of infected people. The outbreak has forced various nations to take drastic action, including Ivory Coast, which has said it is closing borders it shares with Guinea and Liberia for an indefinite period. Senegal also closed its borders over Ebola fears. The closure includes any aircraft and ships traveling to Senegal from Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia. Amid fears of the disease's spread, the Philippines recalled 115 peacekeepers from Liberia. Dr. Peter Paul Galvez, a spokesman for the Philippines' Department of National Defense, said they would be repatriated as soon as possible. They will be quarantined before departure for 21 days, then quarantined again in the Philippines for another 21 days. Early symptoms of Ebola include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. These symptoms can appear two to 21 days after infection. CNN's Kathy Quiano and Val Willingham contributed to this report.","NEW: World Health Organization pulls workers from Kailahun post in Sierra Leone .

"(CNN) -- The FBI shelled out $2.1 million for tips that led to the arrest of fugitive James ""Whitey"" Bulger and his companion, Catherine E. Greig, the agency's Boston office announced Friday. The reward recipients were not identified in a press release, which said the information was a direct result of an FBI public service campaign aimed at netting the pair. At least two people received money. ""To protect the anonymity and privacy of those responsible for providing information which directly led to the arrests of Mr. Bulger and Ms. Greig, the FBI will not comment further regarding this matter,"" the FBI said in a statement. Bulger has pleaded not guilty to all counts against him, including his alleged role in 19 murders. Greig has pleaded not guilty to harboring and concealing him. Prosecutors say Bulger was the head of a South Boston Irish gang before he fled an impending racketeering indictment in 1995. Greig, 60, allegedly assisted Bulger from January 1995 until late June, when the pair was arrested in California, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. The FBI's public service campaign included 30-second spots on television shows that appealed to female viewers in Greig's age group. ""The FBI is targeting that audience with the belief that a friend, co-worker, neighbor, hairstylist, manicurist, doctor or dentist might recognize Greig,"" according to an FBI press release in June. As part of the media campaign, the FBI said it would place images of Greig and Bulger on digital billboards in Times Square in New York and in other cities. The FBI offered a $2 million reward for Bulger's arrest and $100,000 for the arrest of Greig. According to an indictment, Greig and Bulger posed as a married couple under different false identities and claimed to be from states other than Massachusetts. She would shop and handle bills so that Bulger would ""minimize his time in public,"" it asserts.","The couple was arrested in California in June .

"(CNN) -- Misano is home from home for Italian legend Valentino Rossi so it was fitting he would secure his first win of the 2014 season at the circuit on the Adriatic Riviera Sunday and reach another milestone in his remarkable career. The nine-time world motorcycling champion took his 107th victory and surpassed 5,000 grand prix points, over 4,000 in the premier MotoGP class. Rossi took the lead early from pole sitter and Honda teammate Jorge Lorenzo but was being chased by Marc Marquez when the dominant title leader went down on the Rio corner on the 10th lap. Marquez was able to restart his Yamaha but his chances of victory were over and and he finished 15th. Rossi, whose last win came at Assen in 2013, went on to claim the San Marino GP with Lorenzo and Marquez's teammate Dani Pedrosa completing the podium. Rossi's home town of Tavullia is a few kilometers from Misano and his win was greeted with delight by his supporters. ""I had a good start to the race and battled with Marc and Jorge, I knew Marc wanted to stay in front. After I saw the board and understood that he had crashed or something it was a little easier as I already had a small advantage over Jorge,"" he told the official MotoGP website. ""It has been five years since my last victory here, a similar race too, it's like a time machine,"" he added. Marquez said he was pleased to be able to recover after his tumble. ""I saw the possibility of fighting with Valentino for the victory, but that was not possible in the end because of the mistake, I was riding over the inside of the rumble strip and that meant that I lost the front,"" he said. ""Luckily I was able to rejoin the race, continue with a good pace and score a point that could always come in handy in the future."" Marquez remains firmly in command in search of his second straight title with 289 points, but Rossi has closed to within a point of Pedrosa, 214 to 215, in the battle for second place. Pedrosa was taking his ninth podium of the season, edging out another home hope, Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge disclosed Friday that former presidential candidate John Edwards has a life-threatening heart condition, a court source confirmed to CNN. Edwards had sought a delay in his criminal corruption trial, scheduled to begin this month. Attorneys and the federal judge met in a North Carolina courtroom Friday afternoon for a status hearing regarding the pending trial of Edwards, a former U.S. senator. Edwards appeared at Friday's hearing. His lawyers had made the motion for a delay under seal, but some of its details were publicly revealed by the judge in the open hearing. The criminal trial has been delayed until at least March 26, according to the court source. Judge Catherine Eagles said she has been in contact with Edwards' cardiologist, who recommended a postponement, saying Edwards is scheduled to undergo surgery next month. Edwards has to provide the court with a written medical update by February 28, according to court records. One legal expert, Marcellus McRae, a trial lawyer and former federal prosecutor, said he doubted that Edwards' illness would influence a jury verdict. ""Edwards's illness may prompt the public, including potential jurors, to view him in a more sympathetic light. However, it is doubtful that this will have any impact on the outcome of his trial,"" McRae said. ""Given the nature of the charges, his physical condition is of no relevance and he will have in theory recovered by the time the case went to trial in March in any event."" Edwards' attorneys asked in December to delay his criminal trial, saying he had an unspecified medical issue. Edwards is charged with six felony and misdemeanor counts related to donations to and payments from his failed 2008 presidential campaign. He is accused of conspiracy, issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws. He denies any wrongdoing. Edwards' wife, Elizabeth, died of cancer in December 2010. The couple had separated that year, shortly after Edwards admitted that he had fathered a daughter with Rielle Hunter, who was hired to make documentary videos for his campaign for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. March 26 is also when a North Carolina civil trial is scheduled to start in Hunter's invasion-of-privacy lawsuit against Andrew Young, an Edwards aide in the 2008 presidential campaign. Hunter is suing Young to reclaim materials that she says belong to her, including an alleged sex tape that involves Edwards. Hunter's lawsuit claims that the tape was made in or about September 2006 and that she worked with a political action committee for Edwards' campaign between about July 2006 and December 2006.

"(CNN) -- France has booked a place in the Davis Cup final after taking an unassailable 3-0 lead over the Czech Republic in their semifinal tie at Roland Garros on Saturday. Following straight-set victories for Jo-Wifried Tsonga and Richard Gasquet in Friday's singles, the French pair joined forces in the doubles to beat Radek Stepanek and Tomas Berdych in four sets 6-7 (4/7) 6-4 7-6 (7/5) 6-1. ""It's for sure one of the best moments in our career to play here in a semifinal and to win in the second day,"" Tsonga said. ""We always kept the fighting spirit and stayed in the match -- we all know the Davis Cup is tough."" Victory over the reigning champions means France advance to the final for the first time since 2010, where they will face either Italy or Switzerland. The Italian's slim hopes of reaching a first Davis Cup final since 1998 are still alive after a thrilling five-set win in Saturday's doubles rubber over the Swiss in Geneva. Trailing 2-0 after Friday's singles matches, Italy entrusted their fate to Simone Bolelli and Fabio Fognini as they took on Stan Wawrinka and Marco Chiudinelli, who replaced Roger Federer who was rested by team captain Severin Luthi. The match started brightly for the visitors as Bolelli and Fognini took the opening set 7-5 but the Swiss pair immediately hit back taking the second and third sets to leave Italy staring down the barrel. But the Italian pair seemed unperturbed by the prospect of defeat, mounting an impressive comeback to square the match at two sets all before carrying the momentum into the decider to eventually win 7-5 3-6 5-7 6-3 6-2. ""I am much happier with my performance today,"" Fognini said after the marathon four-hour match. ""I served much better than yesterday, I returned much better. It's still going to be very difficult for us but it's a little less difficult than before,"" he added. The 27-year-old will have to recover quickly for Sunday's opening reverse singles rubber where he faces 17-time grand slam champion Federer. Victory for Federer would propel Switzerland to a first final in 22 years and a chance to claim the title for the first time in their history.","France book place in Davis Cup final with a 3-0 win over reigning champions .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A 14-year-old girl disappears on her way home from school, another is last seen near her home and a 16-year-old vanishes after leaving her fast-food job for the day. Amanda Berry is shown near the time of her disappearance in 2003, and how she might appear today. All from the same neighborhood in Cleveland, Ohio, the girls disappeared within five blocks of each other over a four-year span, starting in 2003. Agents and detectives from the FBI and Cleveland Police are looking into hundreds of leads in the cases and whether they may be linked, according to FBI Special Agent Scott Wilson in the agency's Cleveland bureau. ""We kind of put all three of these cases together to work them to see if there's any connection,"" Wilson said. Amanda Berry, 16, vanished on April 21, 2003, after she left her job at a Burger King at about 7:30 p.m. But she never made it to her home just a few blocks away, the FBI says. Berry has pierced ears, a pierced left eyebrow and a scar on her lower abdomen. She would now be 22. Georgina DeJesus was last seen at a pay phone around 3 p.m. on April 2, 2004, as she headed home from school. She and a friend had called the friend's mother seeking permission for a sleepover at DeJesus' house, but the answer was no. The girls then parted ways, and DeJesus was never seen again. She was wearing a white jacket, a sky blue sweater, blue jeans and a cream shirt. She has a light birthmark on her right leg and pierced ears, the FBI says. DeJesus was 14 when she disappeared and would now be 19. Ashley Summers, last seen July 6, 2007, has a heart-shaped tattoo with ""Gene"" on her upper arm. She was initially reported as a runaway after a family argument. ""But the problem is, she's never been seen again,"" Wilson said. Summers, 14, would now be 15. Citing FBI policy, Wilson declined to say whether there are persons of interest in any of the three cases. The girls did not know each other and the FBI would not say whether any of them had mutual friends or acquaintances. ""It's certainly very concerning to us that we have three young girls missing from the same general area and we have to look at every possibility of what happened to them,"" Wilson said.","Three girls disappear within five blocks of each other over four years .

"(CNN) -- On November 7, Great Falls in Paterson, New Jersey, became the latest addition to the national park family. After a long fight by Paterson residents and officials to have the 77-foot waterfall recognized, their dreams were fulfilled -- partially -- by Monday's agreement. There remain years of work to mold Great Falls around National Park Service standards, but the will, and the funds, can now be brought fully to bear on the project. BudgetTravel.com: See the parks . When Ulysses S. Grant declared Yellowstone the country's first national park in 1872, early conservationists could have only dreamed of the vast network of protected areas that grace America's states and territories today. Less than 140 years after Yellowstone's induction, the National Park Service now operates 397 parks and monuments. Great Falls might be years away from completion, but visitors have 396 other options to explore in the meantime. And there's no better time for a park jaunt than this Veterans Day weekend, when over 100 national parks will waive their entrance fees. From November 11-13, explorers can enjoy the beauty and history of national parks from Florida to Hawaii at no charge. (Many other national parks are free throughout the year.) No doubt many visitors will take advantage of this largesse to visit Yellowstone, the Everglades and other crown jewels of the Park Service, but there are worlds of wonder beyond the well-trodden path. Why not take a chance on one of the Park Service's more unusual and lesser-visited locales? Check out the following: . Dry Tortugas, Florida. Hot and remote, the Dry Tortugas are one of the Park Service's most inaccessible destinations. One thing they aren't is dry; the seven islands lying seventy miles west of Key West received their name from their lack of terrestrial fresh water (and an abundance of turtles), but tropical storms inundate the little archipelago with some regularity. Visitors must take a ferry or seaplane to the park, but the reward is worth it: renowned for its marine life and snorkeling, the Dry Tortugas offer clean beaches and clear water, as well as an historic American fortress to explore. Best of all, you probably won't have to share it with many other people. BudgetTravel.com: 16 awe-inspiring American monuments . Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial, Philadelphia. The Park Service isn't exactly modest in its holdings: from the Grand Canyon, to California's Sequoia National Park, to Wrangell--St. Elias in Alaska (the reigning champ at over eight million acres), it has its share of massive parks. But these spaces contain enough to fill a lifetime, so they might not be the best choice for a weekend trip. If you're not up for getting lost in a vast wilderness, why not go to the opposite extreme and visit the smallest destination in the NPS? Commemorating the life of an American Revolutionary hero, this National Memorial includes exhibits and artifacts from Kosciuszko's military career in the new country he helped to liberate. Housed within Kosciuszko's small Philadelphia home and measuring in at only .02 acres, the memorial is perfect for a quick historical tour. Aniakchak, Alaska. Only serious adventurers need apply for an expedition to Aniakchak, a swath of land in southwest Alaska encompassing the volcano that gives the park its name. Extreme weather, a rugged, remote landscape and various other inconveniences -- like bears -- have earned Aniakchak its place as the very bottom rung of the NPS popularity ladder, but the natural riches of wild Alaska are a pot of gold for the few willing to seek out the end of this rainbow. Sure, by the Park Service's own estimates only a few dozen people make it out to Aniakchak each year, but what an unforgettable experience those determined few must have. BudgetTravel.com: 8 most complicated countries to visit . African Burial Ground, New York. From frontier Alaska to the glittering streets of New York, the National Park Service spans all environs. On the opposite end of the spectrum from Aniakchak is the African Burial Ground, located in Lower Manhattan. The monument preserves the remains of several hundred free and enslaved Africans buried in the 17th and 18th centuries. The burial ground was forgotten and built over in subsequent centuries, only to resurface in 1991 as a result of construction excavations. A monument and visitor center now honor the memories of the interred. (The African Burial Ground does not charge admission, but will be closed on Veterans Day.) BudgetTravel.com: 10 most interesting beaches . Nicodemus National Historic Site, Kansas. Billed by the Park Service as ""the oldest and only remaining all Black Town west of the Mississippi,"" Nicodemus was an important outpost for African Americans moving westward after the Civil War. The historical site in Kansas is comprised of several historic buildings within the still--living community of modern Nicodemus. The town also hosts historical festivals at points throughout the year. Hamilton Grange, New York. Many of the Park Service's most popular monuments are dedicated to familiar figures of American history. Abraham Lincoln's three memorials alone attracted over six million visitors in 2010 -- a far cry from the New York City home of Alexander Hamilton, which received only around fifteen thousand visitors a year before closing for renovations in 2006. Hamilton Grange was reopened in September and is now accepting visitors -- and at no charge. If Hamilton holds no interest for you, try another of the lesser-visited memorials dedicated to important Americans: the Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site in Brookline, Massachusetts, celebrates the life of the renowned landscape architect; the Flat Rock, North Carolina Carl Sandburg Home remembers the storied career of the quintessentially American poet; and in Washington D.C., the Mary McLeod Bethune Council House stands in remembrance of the early, determined civil rights activist and educator.

"Kunene region, Namibia (CNN) -- For years, an ancient tribe of semi-nomadic herders known as the Himba has drawn photographers to Namibia's barren northwest. As a result, the striking image of the Himba -- if not their name -- has become known far beyond the remote, unforgiving Kunene region where they eke out a living tending livestock. The reason for this is otjize, a paste of butter, fat and red ochre -- sometimes scented with aromatic resin -- that Himba women apply each morning to their skin and hair, giving them a distinctive red hue. The sight of traditional Himba women has become an iconic image of Africa. There has been much speculation about the origins of this practice, with some claiming it is to protect their skin from the sun, or repel insects. But the Himba say it is an aesthetic consideration, a sort of traditional make-up they apply every morning when they wake. Men do not apply otjize. Although it is constantly jeopardized by development, including proposed hydroelectric projects, many Himba lead a traditional lifestyle that has remained unchanged for generations, surviving war and droughts. These customs can be glimpsed today in the village of Omarumba, where around 20 people live under the leadership of chief Hikuminue Kapika. The Himba are open to outsiders coming to witness their way of life, but ask for a contribution from visitors in return -- in this case, maize, coffee, tea, cooking oil and $25 donation. As pastoralists, cattle are central to the lives of the Himba -- just like their relatives, the Herero, who are renowned for the headwear of their women, which resemble cattle horns. Read also: The Namibian women who dress like Victorians . In the center of the village is a pen where young cattle, sheep and goats are held, while more mature animals are left to roam the periphery. Every morning, after the women have applied their otjize, they milk the cattle, before the young men of the village lead them out to graze. If there is nowhere to graze, the village may relocate, or the young men set up a temporary village with their stock. The past year has been dry, says Uvaserua Kapika, one of the chief's wives, and the village is concerned about the welfare of their livestock. ""Last year, it rain(ed) a lot and I was very comfortable. This year, I don't know what to say... I pray to God as the animals are dying."" The homes of the Himba, who number between 30,000 and 50,000, are round structures constructed of sapling posts, bound together to form a domed roof which is plastered in mud and dung. The most important part of the Himba village is the ""okuruwo,"" or holy fire. Kept continuously alight, the holy fire represents the ancestors of the villagers, who acts as intermediaries to the Himba's god, Mukuru. The chief's is the only house whose the entrance faces the fire -- all the others face away -- and it is important for outsiders not to walk in the sacred area between his house and the fire. Read also: 'Stolen' African skulls return to Namibia . At night, an ember from the fire is brought into the chief's hut, then used to kindle the flames again in the morning. Chief Kapika said he would regularly sit by the fire to interact with his ancestors. ""We pray for rain to come and our cattle to multiply,"" he said. ""He must bless me with more followers as a chief."" Said his wife, Uvaserua Kapika. ""This is the place we pray to our God in heaven. In this place, you can get healed. Everything is performed here.""","The Himba women of northwest Namibia are renowned for their use of otjize .

"(CNN) -- There are, of course, those massive stone statues of ancient legend lining its coast. Then there's the epic isolation -- more than 2,000 miles from the nearest population centers (Chile, Tahiti), it's one of the most remote inhabited places on the planet. But those aren't the only reasons to rank Easter Island (""Rapa Nui"" to locals) high on your list of exotic travel wishes. Polynesian in culture, Chilean in nationality, this volcanic archipelago in the southeastern Pacific Ocean remains a vibrant center of unique Polynesian culture and otherworldly scenery. What's more, it's not hard to get to, with Chile's LAN Airlines making the five-hour flight from Santiago to Easter Island several times a week. Measuring 15 by eight miles, it's easy to cover all of Easter Island in a single, unforgettable stay. Here are five reasons to start planning now. 1. Moai . Numbering almost a thousand, the moai (monolithic human statues carved from a single piece of stone) are scattered all over the island. They're the principal reason people come to Easter Island and truly make any trip a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Carved in the image of the island's Rapa Nui ancestors, the statues date to the twelfth century and measure up to a staggering 32 feet (10 meters) in height. Excavated in the 1970s, they stand in long lines. Some are solitary and all face inland. Each moai is different. Like caricatures, they're fat, thin, big, small, tattooed -- you name it, the Rapa Nui carved them as an expression of an intricate culture that also included petroglyphs, tattooing and ancient Oceania's only written language. 2. Tapati Festival . One of many Easter Island mysteries is how this remote piece of land came to be inhabited. Most historians agree that Polynesian seafarers arrived around 400 AD, but no one knows for sure -- some have posited an extraterrestrial connection. What is known is that it wasn't until 1722, when a Dutch expedition arrived, that the Rapa Nui had any contact with outsiders. At the time, the moai were still standing andÂ the local population numbered around 20,000. Today, the islanders number 5,000 in total. That's just four times the number of moai and less than the island's horse population. But the island's one-of-a-kind culture is kept alive with activities and festivals that highlight ancient arts such as spear throwing, tobogganing, dancing and body painting. The island's top celebration is the Tapati Festival (February 1 through 15, 2013), which revolves around a series of competitions based on ancient sports. The highlight is the Haka Pei, in which male islanders (wearing only small loin cloths) toboggan down the Maunga Pui volcano on banana tree trunks. It's a bumpy, crazy ride. The last competitor remaining atop his log is declared the winner. There are also dance competitions, carnival-style parades, food exhibitions and the crowning of the Tapati queen. 3. Volcanoes . Easter Island is primarily made up of three extinct volcanoes: Terevaka, Poike and Rano Kau. The youngest of the three, Terevaka forms the vast part of the island. Its slopes served as the Rano Raraku quarry, providing the volcanic tuff from which the moai were carved. Today, 400 eerie, petrified heads poke out of Terevaka's grassy hillside, looking as though they were captured and frozen while trying to climb out of the mountainside. Poike makes up the island's east ""wing"" and Rano Kau forms the south. Rano Kau has a huge, impressive crater. It sits astride the ceremonial village of Orongo, which has breathtaking 360-degree views of the island and Pacific Ocean. 4. Food . Easter Island isn't a gourmet destination -- years of deforestation have led to a scarcity of local resources. But being surrounded by ocean means that seafood isn't just a staple, it's outstanding. Fresh beans and yams tend to round out most plates. In Kaloa, the Hangaroa Eco Village's Poerava restaurant might be the best place to eat on the island. It serves a delicious seared tuna and other local specialties according to the availability of ingredients. It also has sweeping ocean views. The resort also includes a bistro that serves pasta and cocktails. In Hanga Roa village, Ariki o Te Pana Cafe has excellent empanadas for those seeking simple, local food at reasonable prices. (Note: local restaurants aren't 'budget' cheap -- for example, you can expect to pay more than US$20 for a dish of spaghetti at many places). 5. Eco-lodges . A highlight for many visitors is a stay in one of the Easter Island's eco-lodges. On the southeast side of the island, Posada de Mike Rapu is made entirely of local wood and gets high ratings for privacy. Opened in 2007, the lodge says it was the first in South America to receive LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification from the United States Green Building Council. The lodge has 30 bedrooms and undisturbed views over fields, red coral trees and the Pacific Ocean. Situated on a chunk of craggy coastline, Hangaroa Eco Village & Spa has 79 bedrooms and is within easy walking distance of the main village of Hanga Roa. It's built in true eco-style, with adobe buildings topped with grass roofs. Inside, cypress tree trunks form pillars and en suite bedrooms have handmade clay baths. It's like staying in a very luxurious cave. Posada de Mike Rapu; +1 866 750 6699 (from U.S.) or +56 2 2395 2800; from US$2,385 for three nights (double occupancy); website .

"(CNN) -- For most couples, a few differences -- whether philosophical, religious, or simply about whose turn it is to do the dishes -- are hardly newsworthy. But for vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan and his wife Janna, political dissimilarities were enough to land them an article in The New York Times. This may not seem like a big deal to the couple themselves -- she's a ""practical conservative"" from a prominent Democrat family and he's, well, a staunch Republican. Yet such seemingly major differences can be mind-boggling to many people, particularly in the heat of election season. Of course, the Ryans aren't the first couple to agree to disagree politically in the name of love. Political strategists James Carville and Mary Matalin famously butted heads on the campaign trail, then stunned America when they fell in love, got married and raised a family. And there have always been rumors that some first ladies haven't agreed with their presidential spouses on every issue; Laura Bush is one example. It may surprise those of us who are in agreement with our partners -- or who can't imagine dating a Republican or Democrat -- but political differences can actually be a benefit to some relationships. ""If a couple who doesn't share political views has a healthy relationship, then that speaks to other strengths,"" says psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert, author of ""Be Fearless: Change Your Life in 28 Days."" ""For example, they may have good communication and conflict resolution skills, a healthy sex life, shared goals, and similar interests -- all of which are possible even if their politics differ."" But how does that conflict play out in the bedroom? Democrats and Republicans may be able to agree to disagree, but their differences appear to continue between the sheets. According to a recent survey by Binghamton University and dating website Match.com of more than 5,000 single American men and women, politically liberal respondents were more likely to have sex more often, but conservative respondents reported having ""better"" sex. Specifically, 53% of those who described themselves as conservative Republicans said that they reached orgasm every time they had sex, compared with 40% of liberal Democrats. ""Orgasm, particularly among women, takes practice and knowing one's body,"" suggests Justin Garcia, a postdoctoral fellow at The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction and a co-researcher on the study. ""Conservatives tend to be more traditional and rigid. So, it reasons that this might also manifest in the bedroom -- once they've found something that works, they stick to it!"" That's just a guess, of course. But the survey also uncovered some other interesting sexual-political tidbits. For example, the liberal Democrats surveyed placed more importance on sense of humor, independence and equality in a partner, while conservative Republicans were more likely to seek out someone of the same background and political party and were more apt to want to get married. Overall, such fun facts make for excellent cocktail party fodder, but they may not have much of an impact on real relationships. In fact, the survey found that just 17% of men and 20% of women said they must be with someone who's in their political party. ""The interesting message from this survey is that, regardless of political affiliation, almost everyone in America recognizes the importance of love and sex, either in their lives or the world around them,"" Garcia says. ""This is an important message during an election year -- human sexuality should not be a politically divisive issue, since it truly concerns us all."" If you do find yourself in a relationship with someone of the opposite political party, take heart -- and follow Alpert's advice. ""Don't define yourself by your political affiliation. You're a husband, a wife, a brother, a sister, a daughter, a son,"" he says. ""Use the different opinions to learn something new. With every political view is a possible discussion where you can learn about your partner. Set ground rules about when to argue -- and know when to walk away."" So this election season, look past the parties and cast your vote for a happy, healthy relationship. The opinions expressed are solely those of Ian Kerner.","Political differences may be a boost to some relationships .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The charge that Justin Bieber assaulted his limo driver in Toronto in December has been dropped. Prosecutors decided there was ""no reasonable prospect"" of convicting Bieber of striking his limo driver on the back of his head, said Brendan Crawley, a spokesman for the Ontario attorney general's office. The dismissal comes just days after Bieber, 20, was arrested on a new assault charge in an alleged fight with a minivan driver in Canada. Bieber's attorneys have been busy this year following three arrests in January, but all of those cases have been resolved now. Trouble seems to pursue the high-profile singer. He's been accused of trying to take cell phones from people photographing him in public spots, but no charges have resulted after police investigations. His bodyguards have also faced charges and lawsuits after clashes with people following Bieber. Justin Bieber: 'Don't believe rumors' The singer settled a drunken driving charge in Miami last month by making a $50,000 donation to a youth charity. The plea deal, which reduced the charge to careless driving, requires Bieber to get 12 hours of anger management counseling and attend a program that teaches about the impact of drunken driving on victims. In July, the pop star accepted another plea deal in a Los Angeles vandalism charge connected with the January egging of his neighbor's house, receiving two years' probation. He must also complete 12 weekly anger management sessions, work five days of community labor and pay $80,900 in restitution to his former neighbor. The Toronto arrest came in late January over an alleged incident a month earlier as Bieber rode in a limousine to a nightclub after attending a hockey game. Bieber was charged with assault and accused of striking his limousine driver on the back of the head several times on the way to the club. The case slowly made its way through Toronto's criminal court system, ending with Monday's decision. ""After completing a thorough review and, in consultation with the police, the Crown determined that there was no reasonable prospect of conviction,"" Crawley said. ""Accordingly, the charge against Mr. Bieber was withdrawn."" Lawyer: Bieber's 'peaceful retreat' interrupted . Bieber's most recent brush with the law came August 29 in Perth County, Ontario, where his father lives. The singer and girlfriend Selena Gomez were riding in an ATV when paparazzi interrupted their ""peaceful retreat,"" according to his attorney Brian Greenspan. ""Investigation revealed that after colliding, the driver of the ATV and an occupant of the minivan engaged in a physical altercation,"" Ontario provincial police spokesman Kees Wijnands said. Bieber's attorney said people with cameras were chasing the singer when the incident happened. Bieber was released on ""a promise to appear"" and ordered to answer the charges at a September 29 hearing, Wijnands said. The alleged victims hired Los Angeles lawyer Gloria Allred, who also represents a woman who accused Bieber of assaulting her at a Hollywood tourist spot when she tried to take a photo of him with her cell phone. ""This is a serious matter that could have an impact on Mr. Bieber's probation status in California,"" Allred said in a statement last week to CNN.Â  ""I have also made contact on my clients' behalf with the Hollywood branch of the Los Angeles Police DepartmentÂ  to make them aware of these new charges."" It would be up to a California judge to decide if the Canadian arrest warrants a probation revocation hearing, according to the spokeswoman for the Los Angeles prosecutor. Is Justin Bieber getting special treatment? CNN's Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report.","Prosecutors found ""no reasonable prospect"" of convicting Bieber, official says .

"(CNN) -- The suicide of a Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity member at a Pennsylvania university may have been caused by hazing, police said Thursday. Marquise Braham, 18, jumped to his death Friday from the roof of a Marriott hotel on Long Island while home for spring break, authorities said. ""He's kind, gentle, fun, sarcastic,"" the victim's father, Rich Braham, told CNN affiliate News 12 Long Island. ""Just good to be around. His entire life was in Christ-centered education."" A freshman at Penn State Altoona, Braham may have been subjected to hazing and physical abuse at an off-campus fraternity house before he committed suicide, said Ron Heller, chief of the Logan Township Police Department. ""There are allegations of hazing, drug abuse, physical abuse and alcohol abuse,"" said Heller, whose police force has jurisdiction of Logan Township, where the fraternity house is located. ""The state of Pennsylvania does not have a specific hazing (section), but a harassment section which would clearly cover this, and if we link the young man's death to hazing, the individuals could be charged with criminal homicide in Pennsylvania . ""Depending on the nature of what this hazing was, it could rise to an assault, and if this young man was distraught over what happened, whether he received hazing or was part of it, we can link that to the perpetrators. If we can link it, we can charge them."" Shari Routch, director of university relations for Penn State Altoona, said the university's Phi Sigma Kappa chapter has been suspended pending the investigation. ""Penn State is looking into alleged violations by the fraternity of the university's code of conduct,"" Routch said. ""There is a separate ... criminal investigation conducted by Logan Township police. We have zero tolerance for hazing, zero tolerance for violations of code of conduct and violations for any illegal activity."" Michael Carey, executive vice president of Phi Sigma Kappa, said the national fraternity was ""aware of the serious allegations"" against its members and urged them to cooperate with law enforcement officials. The fraternity also was conducting an internal investigation. ""It would be improper to comment or speculate on the validity of any allegations of hazing or misconduct of the chapter until we have fully investigated this matter,"" Carey said. Rich Braham said he imagined his son's fraternity involvement to be like the movie ""Animal House."" ""You know, the pledging process,"" he told News 12 Long Island. ""There probably would be some drinking, hopefully not too much. You know, wearing togas."" Heller said Marquise Braham apparently had discussed the hazing with an aunt and several friends. ""In Pennsylvania law, there is a section of causing or aiding a suicide,"" Heller said. ""If you cause by force, stress, or deception someone to commit suicide, you can be charged with criminal homicide in Pennsylvania."" Routch said the university, which has nearly 4,000 students, was offering grief and counseling sessions for students and staff. ""We really want to be a support system for the campus community,"" she said. ""We are a very tight-knit campus and want to support our individuals who have been affected by this."" The university has two fraternities and two sororities, Routch said. ""In the midst of allegations,"" she said, ""we do as a community offer our sincerest condolences to Marquise's family and friends.""","Marquise Braham, 18, jumped to his death from the roof of a Marriott hotel on Long Island .

"(CNN) -- Paignton Zoo in Devon, England, isn't monkeying around with their animals' diets anymore. Zookeepers are trading the monkeys' favorite fruit in for green leafy vegetables, saying bananas grown for human consumption are full of sugar and calories. ""Wait, even the fruit isn't healthy anymore? What's left?!?!"" CNN reader NeoPrudentist posted in what was soon rated the No. 1 comment on the story. What's left, indeed. First coffee. Then salmon. Now this? Not to worry -- this isn't a case of human see, human do. Despite sharing more than 90% of our DNA with these fuzzy primates, humans have some very distinct differences in anatomy. Those English zookeepers aren't totally wrong. All fruit contains sugar, and bananas are slightly denser calorie-wise than other types of fruit. But when it comes to nutritional bang for your buck, bananas are hard to beat. Just remember -- no monkey business: Eat 'em in moderation. Sugar . Bananas contain about 14 grams of sugar. You may have heard that sugar from fruit is better than the sugar you find in candy. But sugar has the same molecular structure whether it comes from a kiwi or a cupcake. Both contain fructose and glucose, although in varying proportions. Neither kind of sugar is really better or worse for you, experts say; the body just processes them differently. Fructose is broken down in your liver, while glucose starts to break down in your stomach and needs insulin to be fully metabolized. The good thing about fruit is that the sugar often comes with fiber, which slows digestion and gives the body time to use it as fuel instead of storing it as fat. Speaking of fiber... Bananas have about 3.1 grams of fiber. Unripe bananas are slightly better for you than ripe bananas, experts say. Greener bananas contain what's called resistant starch, a type of fiber that your body has trouble absorbing. Studies show resistant starch fills you up and may even help you burn fat. Unripe bananas score 30 out of 100 on the glycemic index; ripe ones score about 50. The index indicates how quickly a carbohydrate increases your blood sugar levels. Low-GI foods may help you lose weight because they help control appetite and delay hunger, according to the University of Sydney. Power boost! Every long-distance runner knows the power of a good banana. The fruit contains high levels of potassium and magnesium -- two nutrients athletes lose when they sweat.

"(CNN) -- Dwayne Johnson's mother and cousin survived a head-on collision with a drunken driver last week, the actor said Sunday. Johnson, also known as the Rock, tweeted a photo of the wreck, showing his mother's white SUV with front-end damage, along with a message on Instagram on Sunday. ""First reaction is to find the person who did this and do unrelenting harm to them,"" Johnson wrote. ""But then you realize the most important thing is my family lived thru this and we can hug each other that much tighter these days. Hug your own family tighter today and be grateful you can tell them you love them. #BearHugsAndGratitude"" Johnson suffered a personal loss in November when his ""Fast & Furious"" co-star Paul Walker died in a car crash. The posting didn't detail their injuries, but his cousin -- WWE wrestler Lina Fanene -- posted a photo of the Rock visiting her in a hospital with the caption ""We are a bunch of goof balls!"" Fenene posted an Instagram message about the collision: ""'Everything happens for a reason' Not sure why the very intoxicated woman decided to drive her car, head first, into our car...but I do know that we are extremely lucky to be alive and that everything we have is fixable. It's a bump in the road, but we will get past it and be stronger than before! I'm grateful for all the wonderful LOVE I have received from everyone. My family & friends are AMAZING! Life is wonderful!"" It was not clear when or where the crashed happened, although his mother, Ata Johnson, lives in the Orlando, Florida, area. It apparently happened early in the week, since a Tuesday tweet by Fenene included a photo of her on an airplane with her arm in a sling and the message: ""Still all smiles! Very grateful to be alive for all the love from my family and friends! Incredibly blessed""","Dwayne Johnson tweets about mom, cousin's car crash .

"(CNN) -- ABC's reconstruction of ""The View"" involves not just new co-hosts like Rosie O'Donnell but a new producer, too, sources say: Bill Wolff. Wolff, the executive producer of ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" and the vice president of MSNBC's prime-time programming, will be running ABC's reboot of ""The View,"" according to people with direct knowledge of the plan. Wolff is expected to replace Bill Geddie, who has run the talk show since its inception in 1997. A spokeswoman for ""The View"" did not respond to a request for comment. ABC has said the talk show ""will be moving in an exciting new direction next season,"" without sharing any details. A spokeswoman for MSNBC confirmed Wolff's departure. Before joining the cable news channel, he worked on ESPN programs like ""Around the Horn"" and ""SportsCenter."" ESPN and ABC are both owned by The Walt Disney Co. One of his reasons for rejoining Disney, according to one of the people with knowledge of the plan, is a personal one: He'll be able to have dinner with his family every night. (""Maddow"" ends at 10 p.m., but ""The View"" ends at noon.) Sources spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity because Wolff and ABC had not announced the producer changes, which were first reported by The New York Daily News. According to the Daily News, ABC and NBC engineered a ""swap"" of sorts. In May, NBC announced that it had poached ESPN producer Jamie Horowitz for a new job overseeing the ""Today"" show, but because his ESPN contract hasn't expired, Horowitz hasn't been able to start yet. ""In return for NBC letting Wolff break his current long-term deal,"" ABC has agreed to let Horowitz start work at NBC on September 1, ""three months earlier than planned,"" the newspaper reported. A new season of ""The View"" will also start in September. Changes at the talk show commenced in May, when one of its co-creators and its only remaining original co-host, Barbara Walters, stepped down. Geddie is the other co-creator, and speculation about his future has swirled all summer, especially in light of ABC's comments that it planned to ""evolve the show creatively."" Along with Walters, two other co-hosts have stepped down -- Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy -- leaving Whoopi Goldberg as the only one set to return in the fall. Goldberg will be joined by Rosie O'Donnell and a number of other co-hosts who are still being auditioned. After Thursday's episode of ""The View,"" the producers conducted on-camera tests with nine of the women who are considered contenders for the remaining co-host chairs. Among the women who participated in the tryouts -- dubbed ""chemistry tests"" by ABC -- were Sunny Hostin, SE Cupp and Ana Navarro, all three of whom are regulars on CNN. Hostin is a legal analyst, Cupp is a co-host of ""Crossfire"" and Navarro is a political contributor. Wolff was in attendance at the tryouts, even though his new role hasn't been announced.

"(CNN) -- They say there are no stupid questions -- or are there? How about, ""Do you speak African?"" Or, ""What is Africa's flag?"" Yes, these are quite ludicrous. Tired of regularly having to answer questions like these, a group of U.S.-based African students has launched a photo campaign in a bid to dispel misconceptions about their continent. Called ""The Real Africa: Fight the Stereotype,"" the social media initiative aims to educate and raise awareness about the common stereotypes surrounding Africa and its people -- misunderstandings like Africa being a homogenous entity rather than a diverse continent of more than 50 countries. The campaign features striking images of the members of the African Students Association of New York's Ithaca College wrapped in different African flags or holding them proudly. ""What we wanted to do was embrace the individual flags of the countries of Africa,"" says Rita Bunatal, head of PR for the organization. ""We wanted to show the beauty and the power of the flag. We also wanted to break one of the biggest misconceptions about the continent, which is that Africa is a country,"" she adds. For each photograph, the posing students, aged 18 to 21, were also asked to come up with simple but powerful quotes that would disprove the ignorant and offensive remarks they would often hear. As a result, the images boast statements like ""Africans do not all look alike,"" ""Africans don't need to be saved,"" ""Africa is not a country"" and ""Africa is not a land filled with diseases."" In addition, the campaign is saturated with educational facts that are designed to strengthen the students' quotes -- ""I don't speak 'African' because 'African' is not a language"" says one student, his declaration accompanied by the fact that ""there are an estimated 2,000 languages spoken in Africa."" ""We wanted to give facts, to correct, to give knowledge,"" says Bunatal, ""trying to educate and stop people from saying these other things."" The African Students Association of Ithaca College first posted their photo campaign on CNN's iReport platform on January 20. Since then, some 5,000 people have viewed the photos and more than 2,000 have shared them on Facebook. ""The simplest actions can create awareness and we are hoping to do this not only campus-wide, but also world-wide,"" says Bunatal. Click through the gallery above to see the students' campaign.

"(CNN) -- Luke Cox used to be an athlete. But a year ago, no one would have called him that. The 31-year-old high school social studies teacher and coach weighed about 415 pounds and was too big and tired at the end of the day to get on the floor and play with his kids. At 6 foot 5, Cox was wearing 5XL T-shirts and size 50 jeans. He couldn't stop eating. His mornings began with two breakfast sandwiches and two jelly doughnuts. At night, Cox ate candy and stole the snacks his kids, then 2, 3 and 5 years old, were supposed to take to school the next day. The junk food binges put a strain on his body, the family's food budget and his relationships. ""Here I was teaching students and athletes discipline and hard work when I had none myself,"" the Missouri dad wrote in on CNN iReport. ""I would come home after practice and ignore my wife and young children and sit in front on the TV and fall asleep there."" Luke Cox: In his own words . His wife, Rudy, remembers him saying, ""I just don't know where to start. So I'm not going to."" She would ask him to take a walk with her, and he would say, ""That's pointless. Where am I walking to?"" Rudy had heard about a 12-week weight-loss challenge beginning that March, hosted by Kansas City Fitness Magazine. On January 11, 2013, she e-mailed a ""wife's plea"" to admit her husband. ""Please give him a chance and help him to save his life,"" she wrote. ""Luke is everything to our family."" The program, similar to ""The Biggest Loser"" TV show, provided 30 contestants with licensed trainers, gym memberships, nutrition counseling, life coach sessions, weekly weigh-ins and weekends at an ""accountability ranch."" The 10 people with the greatest weight loss percentage won a makeover and a feature in the magazine. Participants were asked to raise a $600 entry fee from family and friends as a way to stay accountable. ""I didn't like that at first. I felt uncomfortable asking people to pay for my mistake,"" Cox said. But it was effective. ""If people were willing to do that, I didn't want to let them down."" The competition gave Cox the motivation he had been looking for, but he was at a disadvantage. Living in Tarkio, Missouri, a small town 2Â½ hours from Kansas City, he couldn't make use of the licensed physical trainers, state-of-the-art gyms and group workouts that the other contestants had access to. That only made him more determined. ""I had this chip on my shoulder. I didn't have the trainers that they did; I didn't have the gyms they got to work out in,"" he said. He thought to himself, ""I'll show you guys I'm not some country bumpkin."" Cox, who managed to lose a few pounds on his own before the competition began, asked Ty Ratliff, the local elementary school gym teacher and a fellow coach, to be his trainer. They did high-intensity interval workouts and sprints three, and then four, times a week using the high school gym, weight room and track, and a local recreation center. It was a new challenge for Ratliff, who was used to bulking kids up as the weight-training teacher and head high school football coach. ""Usually, our goal is to get kids bigger, faster and stronger. Here, we were doing the opposite: taking pounds off Luke,"" Ratliff said. ""We wanted to him to get stronger ... but we were really focused on the cardiovascular aspect."" Cox never skipped a workout. At the same time, he overhauled his diet. He weaned himself off soda and made sure he was getting lots of lean protein. For breakfast, he ate three hard-boiled eggs and Greek yogurt. Lunch was a spinach salad with 2 ounces of shaved turkey. For dinner, he ate grilled chicken or fish. He prepared his meals the night before and wouldn't eat anything that wasn't in his Nebraska Cornhuskers lunchbox. ""I left my wallet at home so I couldn't go to the school snack machine. I didn't eat with my fellow teachers in the cafeteria because I knew I would want to eat the cafeteria food. I ate in my room by myself. Once I gained enough confidence in myself, I began to eat with them and I brought my wallet to school without going to the snack machine,"" he wrote in his iReport. His small town of about 1,600 people was a big source of encouragement. ""One morning, I bought some victory doughnuts for my basketball team. The clerk at the convenience store reminded me that I was trying to lose weight and that I didn't need those,"" he said. ""I told her that I appreciated her concern and that they were a surprise for my team. That is what is great about a small town."" The hard work paid off: He ended up winning the competition. In 12 weeks, he dropped from 396 to 316 pounds, a 20.2% loss in body weight, and got the biggest feature in the July/August Kansas City Fitness Magazine. He has another profile in the magazine this month. And he kept going. He recently bought his first XL T-shirt since freshman year of college and ran his first 5K. He now weighs 283 pounds and would like to get down to 265 or 270. ""I know with my frame, I'm always going to be a big guy, but I want to be a strong, physically fit guy,"" he said. ""I'll never go back, because I know how hard I've worked to change that."" The transformation has changed his whole family. Instead of watching TV together, they go to the rec center five days a week as a family. Cox comes home now and cooks for his wife and kids, goes for bike rides with them and jumps on the trampoline. Though his kids are still quite young -- 3, 4 and 6 -- he's apologized to them for being so big and not having as much fun with them as a dad should have. ""He's full of energy now. ... He's a totally different person,"" wife Rudy said. ""In their eyes, they have their dad back.""","Luke Cox lost 132 pounds in nine months .

"(CNN) -- A surprise in Kansas Wednesday night is setting the stage for an even more interesting U.S. Senate race this fall. Democratic candidate Chad Taylor decided to drop out of the race, which means more support may go to an independent candidate against Republican incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts. In a statement to the Wichita Eagle, Taylor said, ""After much consideration and prolonged discussion with my supporters, my staff, and party leadership at every level, I have decided to end my campaign for the United States Senate."" The move came hours after independent candidate Greg Orman announced support from a group of moderate Republicans. Orman's campaign may have a better shot now that the contest has narrowed to a two-person race. After word spread of Taylor's withdrawal, Orman in a statement said, ""This is certainly an unexpected turn of events. Chad Taylor is a committed public servant. He ran an honorable campaign and worked hard, and I wish him and his family well."" As CNN Chief National Correspondent John King reported Sunday on growing GOP concern about Roberts' campaign, the GOP needs a gain of six seats to win the Senate majority. If the party lost a Republican-held seat, such as the one in Kansas, it would have to win another Democratic seat toward the goal of netting six. ""A number of top Republican strategists who have seen the latest research say (Roberts' re-election) is now hardly a sure thing,"" King said Sunday, while Democrat Taylor was still in the race. ""These strategists are furious with Roberts personally, and even more so with a campaign team they say has not risen to the challenge. So there is mounting pressure on the other Kansas senator, Jerry Moran, who just happens to lead the National Republican Senatorial Committee."" King added that ""leading GOP voices"" are pushing the NRSC to get more aggressive, including pushing for a shakeup in the Roberts campaign team. ""And in the GOP super-PAC community, there are conversations that it might become necessary to spend money in a state that no one thought would be -- or should be -- on a 2014 list of potential Democratic pickups,"" King said. If the GOP super PACs have to suddenly shift money to Kansas, ""a few GOP challengers in other states could see their outside help shrink,"" King said.","The Democratic candidate withdraws from the U.S. Senate race in Kansas .

"(CNN) -- The statistics, unfortunately, are staggering. An estimated 44 million people worldwide are living with dementia, according to a report released Tuesday by Alzheimer's Disease International. As life expectancies continue to rise around the globe, that number is expected to nearly double by 2030 and more than triple by 2050. But there is some good news laid out in the sixth annual World Alzheimer's Report. For the first time, we're starting to get a clearer understanding of cause and effect when it comes to this debilitating disease. Alzheimer's: The first chapter in a cruel journey . Here's the takeaway, according to Alzheimer's Disease International: What's good for your heart is also good for your brain. More specifically, there is now ""persuasive evidence that dementia risk ... can be modified through reduction in tobacco use and better control and detection for hypertension and diabetes, as well as cardiovascular risk factors."" Alzheimer's is No. 6 on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of the top 10 causes of death in the United States, claiming nearly 85,000 lives in 2010. Alzheimer's toll may rank with cancer, heart disease . ""Given this epidemic scale and with no known cure, it's crucial that we look at what we can do to reduce the risk or delay the onset of developing the disease,"" wrote Marc Wortmann, executive director of Alzheimer's Disease International. ""Governments must develop adequate strategies to deal with the epidemic holistically, including tacking both reduction in risk for future generations, and adequately caring for people living with the condition and supporting their friends and family."" The bottom line is that it's never too late to make some changes to improve your physical and mental well-being. Here are five things you can do right now to reduce your risk of dementia: . 1. Look after your heart. 2. Be physically active. 3. Follow a healthy diet. 4. Challenge your brain. 5. Enjoy social activity. The 10 warnings signs of Alzheimer's . The strongest evidence exists in linking dementia to a lack of education in early life, hypertension in midlife and smoking and diabetes across a lifetime, according to the new report. ""There's also relatively strong evidence that people in low-education countries have a higher risk for Alzheimer's and other dementias,"" said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs for the Alzheimer's Association. ""(This) can be controlled across the lifespan. Taking people and giving them a better education in grade school, high school, and college significantly lowers risk at the population level."" It's also important to keep our brains buzzing as we get older. ""While we don't endorse specific activity like crosswords or mazes,"" Fargo said, ""we say, 'Find a mentally challenging activity that's fun or enjoyable for you, and you'll maintain it. That's going to be good for your brain health as you age.' "" ""If we can all enter old age with better developed, healthier brains,"" the report concludes, ""we are likely to live longer, happier and more independent lives, with a much reduced chance of developing dementia."" The global cost of dementia in 2010 (the latest year for which data are available) was estimated at $604 billion. That number is expected to rise to $1 trillion by 2030. ""With this in mind,"" wrote World Dementia Envoy Dr. Dennis Gillings, ""we can't afford to do nothing.""","World Alzheimer's Report: 44 million people worldwide are living with dementia .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama embarks on a two-day U.S. road trip Tuesday to assess and amplify his government's response to two unconnected overseas emergencies -- the Ebola outbreak in Africa and Islamic terrorists in Iraq and Syria. On Tuesday Obama will announce significant new U.S. efforts to combat the Ebola epidemic, which has moved quickly across the western part of Africa and sent governments there scrambling to respond. The plan, which he'll announce at the Atlanta headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, includes new military assistance to the region and an increase in trained medical professionals sent to help. On Wednesday, Obama heads further south to assess his mission against ISIS at U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida. Ebola's spread is unrelated to the U.S. mission to degrade ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria. But both have prompted worry among Americans about their personal safety and led to charges the White House isn't doing enough to combat the hazards. The dual foreign plagues have yet to pose an immediate threat to the United States homeland, the White House says, though each has claimed the lives of Americans abroad. And officials say both Ebola and ISIS could grow to become unmanageable problems if action isn't taken now to stamp them out. The President's stop Tuesday at the CDC comes amid escalating criticism from health experts on the global response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where almost 2,500 people have died. At the U.S. public health agency Obama will be briefed on the outbreak and speak to officials there about how the U.S. is responding. Afterwards he'll announce new U.S. commitments in combating the virus' spread. Working through the Defense Department, the U.S. will plan and construct treatment centers that could house up to 1,700 beds, administration officials said. With a U.S. general leading the effort from Liberia's capital of Monrovia, American military personnel in the region could increase by 3,000. Medics and other uniformed professionals will work to train up to 500 health care workers per week in identifying and caring for people with Ebola. The U.S. government also hopes to send 400,000 treatment kits with sanitizer and other items to at-risk homes, an attempt to contain the disease. Public health campaigns will be broadcast through existing networks in the countries most affected by the virus: Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Officials hope a more coordinated logistical situation on the ground, put in place by the United States, will encourage other nations to step up their own efforts in fighting Ebola, which experts worry could spread even more rapidly if more isn't done now to contain it. ""We've seen dozens of cases turn into hundreds, then hundreds turn into thousands,"" one U.S. administration official said. ""If we do not arrest that growth, and don't arrest that growth now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of cases."" Epidemiologists and others who are monitoring the disease have claimed developed countries like the United States haven't sent enough resources to the region, and U.S. officials acknowledge that Tuesday's announcement reflects the fact that more needs to be done to stop Ebola's spread. The U.S. has committed more than $100 million in the effort to combat Ebola, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development, and Obama plans to call on Congress to approve an additional $88 million as part of a bill to fund the federal government. Last week USAID said it would spend $75 million to build treatment facilities and supply them with medical equipment. The Pentagon says it's working to shift $500 million of currently not yet obligated funds toward the Ebola effort. The efforts of the United States -- deemed more extensive than any previous U.S. response to an epidemic -- have so far been unable to stop the spread of the deadly virus, which Obama and White House officials are calling a national security problem. Particularly concerning, U.S. officials say, is the potential for instability in the countries where Ebola is rampant and the possibility for the virus to mutate into a more dangerous form. Ebola currently only transmits though contact with bodily fluids; a mutation that allows the virus to spread through the air would pose a catastrophic threat to human populations worldwide, health experts say. Speaking Monday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said there was still a ""very low"" likelihood the Ebola virus could mutate in a way that poses a threat to the United States. ""Right now, the risk of an Ebola outbreak in the United States is very low, but that risk would only increase if there were not a robust response on the part of the United States,"" Earnest said. The potential for increased risk to the U.S. homeland has also inspired the more robust response to ISIS terrorists, who Obama announced last week would be the target of an air campaign inside Iraq and Syria. That mission is run from U.S. Central Command in Tampa, where Obama will receive a briefing on battle plans Wednesday. The White House said the President would also visit servicemen and women during his stop at the facility. Obama and his aides maintain that ISIS fighters don't currently pose a direct threat to the U.S. homeland but warn of the potential for militants with U.S. or Western passports to return home and stage an attack remains a top concern. Secretary of State John Kerry has been engaging Arab and European nations in building a coalition to fight ISIS, though levels of commitment from foreign partners has remained vague.","U.S. significantly increasing support to Ebola response in Africa .

"(CNN) -- ""Cruising"" -- the word conjures up images of overflowing buffets, arm-wrestling at the soft serve machine and death by deck quoits. But there's another side to this kind of travel that spits in the eye of the stereotypical deckchair-hogging cocktail sipper -- and that's adventure and expedition cruising. It's almost deceptive to call it ""cruising."" It's truly ""adventure by ship"" where the often exotic destination is as much part of the attraction as the way you get there. These floating adventures take the form of anything from five-star Champagne explorations to ambling along in a tramp steamer. 10. Island safari, Hawaii, United States . Extreme rating: 6/10 . No, not the land of nodding Elvis Presley dolls and plastic grass skirts. Over at Big Island, adventurous vacationers can get aboard the Safari Explorer with just 36 others and, in between kayaking, hiking among volcanoes and dolphin spotting, engage in a mesmerizing ballet with manta rays. The cruise visits islands such as Moloka'i, a kind of frangipani fortress housing the true Hawaiian ""aloha"" spirit, and Lana'i, where you can hunt and shoot and go horseriding.

Until only a few years ago, the fabled Northwest Passage was just a theoretical shipping route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across the top of Canada. For centuries, people died trying to get through and some of them are still there, buried in permafrost graves. Now, with changing climates, the passage can be completed with more confidence and your bragging rights enhanced without fear of death. While you're there, you can visit the Inuit communities who've lived on the ice for centuries. OneOcean Expeditions, from $600 per person per night. 8. Through ancient Kimberley, Australia . Extreme rating: 7/10 . The 16th-century Dutch explorers wouldn't have a bar of it. Australia's northwest is so inhospitable, it's even a challenge for the local Njikena and Punaba people who've lived there for thousands of years. But this remote and harshly beautiful part of Australia is the country's adventure cruise hotspot. Its season is from April through to September, when the torrential rains have eased and water cascades off the plateau. Infested with crocodiles and spotted with possibly the world's oldest rock art, the Kimberley is in danger due to unchecked oil and gas exploration -- you should go before it's spoiled.

Sure, it's the world's largest river by volume but it's also a major sea lane. You reach the departure point for the Amazon's best cruising by flying to the city of Iquitos, Peru, and then making for the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve where the evocatively named Yanayacu (blackwater) and Ucayali (canoe breaker) rivers feed into the main body. Wildlife in the reserve include piranha, sloths, rare pink dolphins and lots of noisy monkeys. You can commune with the indigenous Ribereňos families who live along the banks before retiring to a luxury 24-passenger vessel to fry your piranha.

The Brahmaputra River begins in the glaciers of Tibet before winding through India and emptying, 2,900 kilometers later, into the Bay of Bengal. While the cruise aboard the delightfully anachronistic 24-person Charaidew trundles along from Guwahati to Tezpur, you can sip local tea and enjoy mild Assamese curries onboard. A visit to the UNESCO-listed Kaziranga National Park, for elephant, rhino and (maybe) tiger spotting, is one of the diversions en route. Assam Bengal Navigation, from $400 per person per night.

Countries such as Angola, Sierra Leone and Congo are starting to recover from their devastating conflicts, allowing visitors to explore the former slave ports, wildlife sanctuaries and voodoo markets. Ramshackle villages along the coastal cruise route provide plenty of opportunities for eating, drinking, singing and dancing.

Extreme rating: 8.5/10 . When your neighbors come home from their heroic Antarctic cruise, chances are they've been on a doddle across to the continent's Peninsula. You can trump them by following in the wake of real explorers such as Scott, Amundsen and Mawson. Sail to the Ross Sea or Commonwealth Bay, where these blokes walked out into the white, and you'll find the huts they left behind, still crammed in some cases with frozen 100-year-old kit. Landing at Mawsons Hut can be tricky, though. If massive icebergs the size of small republics don't block your passage, the famed katabatic winds that blow up to 200mph threaten to push you back to Tasmania.

Pelagic specks with names such as Vostok, Starbuck, Jarvis, Washington and Palmyra Islands are the objective for no other apparent reason than they exist. Finishing up in Western Samoa after 29 days, your objective is to have landed on 10 of these remote islands -- the company even offers a pro-rata refund if you don't. Wild Earth Travel, from $1,200 per person per night. 2. Ice-breaking to the North Pole . Extreme rating: 9.5/10 . It doesn't get much more extreme than this (although see below). Just 100 years ago voyagers to the North Pole received equivalent celebrity to the moon explorers Neil Armstrong and team in the 1960s. You could still choose to haul your sled over the treacherous crevasses, hummocks and sastrugi (ice obstacles) or instead get aboard the world's most powerful icebreaker, the Russian nuclear 50 лет Победы (50 Years of Victory). There's not a lot to see en route as 340MW turbines push 25,000 tons of steel through the icepack up to three meters thick on the way to 90 deg N. Leaving Murmansk, in Russia, you're back within two weeks. Quark Expeditions, from $2,000 per person per night. 1. Down to the Titanic wreck, Atlantic Ocean . Extreme Rating: 10/10 . If crazy Clive Palmer's vision comes to life, you'll be able to sail on a replica Titanic in 2016. But for a glimpse of life (and death) aboard the original 1912 vessel, you can get aboard a specialized submersible for an eight-hour joy ride down to the ship, 12,500 feet below the surface of the North Atlantic. Trips are intermittent depending on demand and various legal wrangles, but if the Titanic is off the menu, tours are also available to Bismarck (15,000 feet) or the Mid-Atlantic Hydrothermal Vents at a trifling 10,000 feet.

"(CNN) -- Friday's 13th stage of the Tour de France may have been unlucky for Rafal Majka, but the Polish rider made amends by storming to victory in the 14th stage on Saturday. Majka had said he was ""hungry for more"" after finishing 10 seconds behind overall leader Vincenzo Nibali in the stage from Saint Etienne to Chamrousse. And so it proved as the Tinkoff-Saxo rider went one better on the 177-kilometer route from Grenoble to Risoul -- the second of two Alpine stages on this year's tour. Majka was part of a 17-rider breakaway formed early on in the stage that was gradually whittled down to 10 with around 60 kilometers to go as the riders made the ascent of the Col de l'Izoard. With nine kilometers to the finish it was Majka who surged ahead of the pack. Nibali tried to stay in touch but Majka managed to hold on to the lead to claim his first win in his first Tour de France, crossing the line 24 seconds ahead of the Italian with France's Jean-Christophe Peraud coming home in third. Afterwards, Majka dedicated his victory to teammate and two-time champion Alberto Contador who crashed out of the race on stage 10 last Monday. Second place for Nibali further strengthens his grip on the yellow jersey. With the Astana rider's main rivals Spain's Alejandro Valverde and France's Romain Bardet finishing the stage 10th and fifth respectively, Nibali extended his overall lead to four minutes and 37 seconds. Sunday's stage sees the riders tackle 222 kilometers from Tallard to Nimes.","Tinkoff Saxo rider Rafal Majka beats Tour de France leader Vincenzo Nibali in stage 14 .

"(CNN) -- With the Alps looming large, Norway's Alexander Kristoff took his chance to fulfill a childhood dream and sprint to victory in a stage of the Tour de France Thursday. The powerfully built Kristoff will be off the pace when the road goes upwards on Friday's 13th stage, but on the less taxing 185.5km run from Bourg-en-Bresse to Saint-Etienne he was in his element in the finishing dash. The Katusha rider hit the front with a powerful surge and held off green jersey holder Peter Sagan of Slovakia, who again missed out on a stage win despite his consistent high finishes. The 27-year-old Kristoff has come to the fore this season with a victory in the Milan-San Remo one-day classic but was desperate for a Tour de France stage win. ""I was dreaming about this since I was a child and to finally achieve it is amazing,"" Kristoff told Eurosport after his victory. The stage was not totally flat and contained four climbs deemed worthy of classification, enough to end the chances of Kristoff's great rival Marcel Kittel, who has three victories already on the 2014 Tour. A five-man breakaway was reeled in on the descent of the final climb and after that it was down to the teams with recognized sprinters to get organized for the bunch sprint. Race leader Vincenzo Nibali retained his two minute 23 second advantage over second-placed Richie Porte of Team Sky, but is aware that the battle for overall honors is reaching a crucial point. ""The Alps will be very tough,"" said the Italian. ""Tomorrow and the next day are really important stages for the Tour de France."" One man missing will be Garmin-Sharp's Andrew Talansky, who rode so heroically to the finish of the 11th stage, despite the effects of heavy falls earlier in the Tour. He made it inside the time limit, but before the start of Thursday's stage it was announced that the 25-year-old American had pulled out. ""I'm absolutely heartbroken to leave the Tour,"" he said. ""I had hoped the rest day (Tuesday) would allow me time to recover from me injuries."" A team doctor said Talansky was suffering from acute sacroiliitis, a condition which causes acute pain in the buttocks and legs as well as a chest infection. He joins other major contenders such as reigning champion Chris Froome and two-time winner Alberto Contador on the sidelines, all victims of crashes.","Alexander Kristoff wins 12th stage of Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- The national controversy over a surge of Central American immigrants illegally crossing the U.S. border established a new battleground this week in a small Southern California town, where angry crowds stopped detained migrants from entering their community. The sentiment carried over to a raucous Wednesday night meeting at a Murrieta high school auditorium. Border Patrol and immigration officials got an earful. ""This is an invasion,"" attendee Heidi Klute said before a full house. ""Why isn't the National Guard stopping them from coming in?"" The overflow crowd of hundreds spilled out into the school's parking lot. In a faceoff Tuesday with three buses carrying the migrants behind screened-off windows, demonstrators chanted ""Go back home!"" and ""USA,"" and successfully forced the coaches to leave Murrieta. The buses instead took the 140 or so undocumented immigrants to U.S. processing centers at least 80 miles away, in the San Diego and El Centro areas, federal officials say. Counterprotesters squared off with the demonstrators, and a shouting match erupted over the nation's immigration system, which recently has been overwhelmed with a tide of Central American minors illegally entering the United States alone or with other children. Local politicians appear to be in lockstep with their constituents. ""It's a nationwide problem, and little ol' Murrieta has taken the lead,"" said Mayor Alan Long. Riverside County Supervisor Jeff Stone got a rise out of the crowd, asking them to hold the White House accountable. ""Petition Obama to stop using these refugees to satisfy a political agenda,"" he said. Root of the problem . A mix of poverty, violence and smugglers' false promises is prompting the Central American inflow. Unlike undocumented Mexican migrants, who are often immediately deported, the Central Americans are detained and processed by the U.S. government, and eventually released and given a month to report to immigration offices. Many never show up and join the nation's 11 million undocumented residents, says the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol agents. The Latin American immigrants rejected by Murrieta protesters were initially held in Texas, where U.S. facilities are so overflowing that detainees are sent to other states for processing. The government doesn't have the room to shelter the children with adults: There's only one family immigration detention center, in Pennsylvania. To assist the unaccompanied children, President Barack Obama's administration opened shelters last month on three military bases, because federal facilities more designed for adults were overrun with minors. Tuesday's busloads of detained Central American immigrants didn't include any unaccompanied minors, said Murrieta Police Chief Sean Hadden, who put the number of protesters at 125. The children on the buses were apparently in the company of relatives or other adults, said an official with the National Border Patrol Council. 'Deport! Deport!' The protesters -- who shouted ""Impeach Obama!"" and ""Deport! Deport!"" -- confronted the buses a day after the town posted a notice on its website: ""Murrieta Opposes Illegal Immigrant Arrival."" ""This is a failure to enforce federal law at the federal level,"" Long said in a statement Monday about the pending arrival of the 140 immigrants at the U.S. Border Patrol station. ""Murrieta continues to object to the transfer of illegal immigrants to the local border patrol office."" Long spoke to CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" later Wednesday. ""It's not against the immigrants,"" he said. ""They're trying to leave a less desirable place and come to the greatest nation in the world. We can't blame them for that. ... No one's protesting that. What we're protesting is the product of a broken system that finally reached the doorstep of our community."" Long said that neither side in the national debate is coming up with a solution: ""The problem still is there. The problem is in Washington, D.C."" The U.S. government is scheduled to send another group of undocumented immigrants to Murrieta for processing on Friday, a union official for Border Patrol agents said. Hadden also said he was told to expect 140 immigrants every 72 hours, with the next group scheduled to arrive on Friday, the Fourth of July. Earlier Wednesday, immigration rights advocates denounced the protesters. ""It is deplorable that people espousing anti-immigrant hate language created unnecessary tension and fear for immigrant mothers and their children,"" Pedro Rios, a community representative of the San Diego Immigrant Rights Consortium, said in a statement. ""Even more concerning is that elected officials in the City of Murrieta instigated this tension. Mothers and their children on these buses have suffered through enough trauma."" Intense debate . The furor in Murrieta illustrated the conflict between protecting the borders and ensuring the safety of detained immigrants and children. Protester Ellen Meeks said the country's identity has eroded with an influx of undocumented immigrants. ""I just wish America would be America again because it's not, and it's not just pointed to the Hispanics,"" Meeks said. ""Everybody needs to go through the legal ways."" Other protesters told CNN affiliate KGTV they wanted immigrants to follow the legal process to enter the United States. ""Everybody that wants to come to this nation is entitled to, but they should come the right way,"" Bob Cuccio told the news outlet. ""You bring in all these children and they're going to take over our schools,"" Bel Reeves added. ""What's going to happen to the kids that were born and raised here?"" But immigration rights advocate Enrique Morones likened the migration to a refugee crisis and suggested racial antipathy was motivating protesters. ""If these children were from Canada, we would not be having this interview,"" Morones said. ""The parents have had enough. They are saying, 'If I don't send my child north, they are going to die.'"" The U.S. government is struggling to detain and accommodate an influx of undocumented immigrants, particularly a wave of unaccompanied children from the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The U.S. government doesn't have enough beds, food or sanitary facilities. Authorities estimate 60,000 to 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year in what the White House has called an ""immediate humanitarian crisis."" Last month, the Obama administration unveiled a plan to spend almost $100 million in aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to help reintegrate the undocumented migrants whom the United States will deport, and to help keep them in their home countries. The administration also will set aside $161.5 million this year for the Central American Regional Security Initiative programs in an effort to ""help stem migration flows as well as address the root cause of the migration,"" the White House said. The Obama administration has accused syndicates in Latin America of waging a deliberate campaign of misinformation about relocating to the United States that has caused people in poor Central American countries and Mexico to risk their lives to cross the U.S. border illegally.

"(CNN) -- China's Li Na became the first Asian tennis player to win a grand slam singles title as she defeated defending champion Francesca Schiavone in the final of the French Open on Saturday. The 29-year-old triumphed 6-4 7-6 (7-0) against the Italian, having been the first player from her country to reach the final of the clay-court tournament. The victory will push her up to a career-high fourth in the world rankings, equaling the best by an Asian player set by Japan's Kimiko Date Krumm back in 1995. ""I was nervous but I didn't want to show my opponent. I think everyone in China will be so excited,"" she told reporters. ""I got a text message from my friend saying they were crying in China because they saw the national flag coming up. ""Today is a dream come true. When I was a young player I always wanted to be a Grand Slam champion. Here someone said I was getting old -- it's not easy for the old woman's dream to come true! Not many players can win a grand slam."""" Li Na: China's tennis rebel is people's idol . Li had lost in her only other grand slam final appearance, when she also made history by reaching the title match at January's Australian Open, but this time she showed none of the nerves on display in that defeat by Kim Clijsters. She wrapped up the first set in only 39 minutes, hitting 15 winners to three by Schiavone as her aggressive tactics from the back of the court paid off -- mirrored by her 10 unforced errors to five. Li led 4-2 in the second set and appeared poised for an easy victory, but she faltered in the seventh game as the guileful Schiavone found her way back into the match. Roland Garros: The dark secrets of a chic tennis stadium . The 30-year-old had two chances to level the match against Li's serve, at 5-4 and 6-5, but both times her Chinese opponent fought back as the two played out some stunning rallies. Schiavone had big support in the crowd at Roland Garros after beating home hope Marion Bartoli in the semifinals, but Li -- who earlier eliminated favorites Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka -- powered through the tie-break without conceding a point. ""She played well. I couldn't push her from the baseline,"" Schiavone said. ""Then we were closer. One has to lose, one has to win. She deserved to win."" Schiavone beat Li in the third round in Paris last year, but was impressed by her opponent's improvement since then. ""She runs much more. Now she can hit one or two shots more. That is a big advantage on the clay,"" Schiavone said. ""I can imagine many people in China were watching this and will watch more now. I think it's also important for them to know clay courts over there -- I think they just have hard courts. This can be a good start for them."" It was China's first triumph at a grand slam since 2006, when Yan Zi and Zheng Jie won the women's doubles titles at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon. Meanwhile, Max Mirnyi of Belarus and Canada's Daniel Nestor won the French Open men's doubles title on Saturday. The second seeds, who have won 10 grand slam crowns between them with other doubles partners, triumphed 7-6 (7-3) 3-6 6-4 win over Colombia's Juan Sebastian Cabal and Eduardo Schwank of Argentina.","Sixth seed Li Na beats defending champion Francesca Schiavone in French Open final .

"(CNN) -- Aberdeen's Old Town House, an 18th century brick building replete with clock tower and cockerel wind vane, was restored a decade ago with great care. Walls were treated with plaster lined with horse hair, while the beams were strengthened with nails designed not to split the aged wood. Traditional techniques dating back to biblical days were used, ensuring the building's historic value was retained. It's a $1.6 million job Kenny Anderson is particularly proud of. The building was once the business center of the town, and it now appears in the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland's logo. For the owner of Scotland's Anderson Construction, which employs just 40 people, this shows how apparently minor players, like Scotland if it becomes independent, can achieve big things. Anderson sees his company as a metaphor for the benefits of a ""yes"" vote. He is supporting the campaign for an independent Scotland, one which has sent shudders through Westminster -- and further afield -- as it gains traction ahead of Thursday's vote. Polls show the vote is on a knife edge, and the uncertainty has already hit the pound, prompted banks to threaten to quit Scotland and forced Bank of England governor Mark Carney to warn of currency risks of a breakaway. A split would end the 307-year union with England and Wales as Great Britain, which has helped push Scotland to its affluent position on the global stage. But, its detractors argue, it's also held it back from its full economic potential. For Anderson, the Aberdeen leader of pro-independent group Business for Scotland, the economics can be seen as more simple. He sees his company as a microcosm of the bigger debate. In a small, independent business, it's ""easy to change things, it's easy to make fast decisions,"" he said. ""I used to be a minority shareholder in much larger company and making good decisions, and changing things is ten times more difficult."" Scotland's riches . Scotland is richer, per capita, than the UK, a fact the independence campaigners love to champion. Its access to oil pushes its GDP per person to 115% of the UK's, according to the Scottish government, making it the world's 14th richest country. The UK ranks at number 18. Scotland's total GDP was $240 billion in the year to first quarter of 2014, around 8% of total UK GDP. Scotland's economic output per head is also the highest in the UK outside London and the South East of England, according to national statistics. Beyond oil, a global taste for Scottish whisky boosts its economy, with food and drink making up nearly a fifth of its $40 billion exports internationally, government figures show. Scotland exports a further $75 billion worth of goods and services into the UK -- which, the pro-independence camp says, means an independent country could claim to be a significant global exporter. But the Scots have been hit hard by the recession. During its most painful year, 2009, the country's economy shrank by 6%, lagging behind the rest of the UK, where the contraction was 4%. Productivity and average household incomes are also below the overall UK levels. But those promoting a breakaway say the country would be more resilient and would have survived the recession better had it not been in Westminster's shadow. Edinburgh's economic advisory body -- which includes Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz -- has argued economic policies tailored to local needs would boost growth. Independent Scotland could, for example, aim its tax policies at helping the crucial exporters. Anderson agrees. ""Scotland has certain unique industries which are incredibly important to it, but from Westminster point of view are lower down the agenda than they would be in independent Scotland."" Whisky, gas and tourism are high on that list, he said. And oil is the trump card. The question of oil . Scotland's black gold is used by both sides to bolster their arguments. Around 90% of the UK's oil comes from Scotland. The Scottish government says it has up to 24 billion barrels of oil reserves in the North Sea, which could generate up to $2.4 trillion in revenue. Such wealth plays directly into the independence debate. The bulk of oil workers want Scotland to become independent, with 70% telling pollsters they're set to vote in favor. Kevin Forbes, chief executive of the Oil and Gas People recruitment company, which commissioned the research, said the industry's workers ""are not getting scared"" by the ""no"" campaign. The Scottish government is also promoting the idea of an oil fund, such as that in Norway, which indirectly supports social spending -- something the UK government has not done. But others warn Scotland's oil riches could prove more fleeting than the ""yes"" campaigners suggest. Last month Scottish billionaire oil magnate Ian Wood stirred the debate by claiming Scottish oil reserves could be completely depleted by 2050, saying the country had between 15 and 16.5 billion barrels of oil still available. His stance -- supported by British oil giant BP -- was rejected by the pro-independence campaign. Scotland's oil production has been declining steadily over the past decade. It dropped more than 10% in both 2013, following a decline of 14% in 2012, according to the Scottish government. The decline has been offset by rising oil prices. The currency headache . The currency question remains Scotland's thorniest. In the past, the Scottish government has promoted the idea of joining the euro. But with the 18-country bloc struggling to emerge from crisis and facing further slowdown as its relations with Russia deteriorate, the idea has been dismissed. Now, it's seeking a currency union with the rest of the UK, similar to the one Benelux countries had before joining the euro. But British Prime Minister David Cameron has whole-heartedly rejected the idea and it's one on which Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has come unstuck in political debates, unable to offer a clear answer to the question so many investors are asking. But the political point-scoring might prove just that: Stiglitz and his fellow advisers say a common currency may be forced upon Scotland and the rest of the UK by economic necessity. The cost of splitting the currency would be simply to high for both sides of the border. It's the economy, stupid . Ahead of the referendum, Scots are split on their ambitions. While the economic partnership is central to the debate, campaigners are going for hearts over heads. The independent ""yes"" campaign is trundling out pictures of happy children, prosperous towns and beautiful Scottish countryside. The ""better together"" campaign emphasizes the strong tradition of the union, and at times uses scare tactics. The uncertainty is already being blamed for destabilizing the economy. Keith Cochrane, head of engineering company Weir, penned an open letter with 200 other business leaders warning their compatriots about the costs and unknown consequences of a vote for independence. Cochrane believes Scots will ultimately be swayed by the impact on their wallets. ""We are all proud Scots, and [emotions] will influence [us] to varying degrees. But what is clear from the opinion polls is that the economy and the arrangements to secure the future business of Scotland are the number one issue,"" Cochrane said. For Anderson, however, that impact is the opposite to what Cochrane argues. During his two decades in business, Anderson has put his business stamp on numerous projects in Aberdeen. He employs locally and he relies on Scottish suppliers, including for the special nails used in the Old Town House refurbishment. Blunt, but with sharpened sides, they reflect the type of nails used in biblical times, for crucifixions, according to Anderson. Such supplies are difficult to find, but those used for this most delicate project were manufactured in Glasgow.","Business and economy is at the top of the agenda ahead of the Scottish independence referendum .

"Melbourne, Australia (CNN) -- Li Na took advantage of her second chance at the Australian Open. The Chinese tennis trailblazer was a point away from exiting in the third round but survived against Lucie Safarova and didn't lose another set the rest of the tournament. The world No. 4 beat diminutive dynamo Dominika Cibulkova 7-6 (7-3) 6-0 in Saturday's final to collect a second grand slam title following her success at the 2011 French Open. Li also made it third time lucky in Melbourne after defeats in the 2011 and 2013 finale. ""At least, you know, I made it,"" Li told reporters. ""Not like the last two times, always feeling (there was) one more step. But this time I'm so proud myself."" The 31-year-old was a popular champion -- receiving the lion's share of applause when the players were introduced at Rod Laver Arena -- and likely attracted even more fans thanks to her comical post-match speech on court. Read more: Full coverage of CNN's Open Court . Li began by thanking her agent, Max Eisenbud, who also represents Maria Sharapova. ""Max, my agent, thanks for making me rich,"" said Li, named last year by Forbes as the third richest female athlete in the world behind Sharapova and Serena Williams with takings of $18.2 million. Li later mentioned her husband Jiang Shan, who in the past has been the butt of the baseliner's jokes. ""Now of course my husband is even famous in China,"" she said. ""You are a nice guy. Also you are so lucky to find me!"" The 5-foot-3 Cibulkova was appearing in her maiden grand slam final and a victory would have made the 24th-ranked Slovakian the joint shortest singles winner at a major in the Open Era. No one would have begrudged her the title, too, since she had topped four players inside the top 20 including Sharapova and Agnieszka Radwanska. Li, meanwhile, didn't face anyone inside the top 20. ""This was just a fantastic two weeks of my life,"" said Cibulkova, who cried as she addressed the crowd. ""This means a lot for our country and I'm happy I could be the one here for Slovakia. ""Maybe tomorrow morning I will be 100% proud of myself,"" she later told reporters. ""But now it's just maybe like 50%."" Expected to defeat Cibulkova -- she had won all four previous meetings with the 24-year-old -- Li proceeded to break early and took a 2-0 lead. But she admitted to being nervous and after the hard-hitting Cibulkova saved a break point to avoid trailing 3-0, she rallied to grab a 4-3 lead. ""Today it was very dangerous,"" Li's coach Carlos Rodriguez, long associated with seven-time grand slam champion Justine Henin, told CNN. ""You're in the final for the third time, you've never been the favorite before, you are today, you have to deal with such a good player who has beaten the top five and top three during the second week."" Li held serve under pressure at 4-5 and then broke for 6-5. Instead of kicking on, though, she missed a backhand down the line on set point and a tiebreak was needed to decide the opener. Li took a convincing 5-1 lead as she settled down and once the set was decided, she relaxed -- and Cibulkova couldn't recover from the tiebreak. ""She was going for her shots,"" Cibulkova told reporters. ""After it was impossible for me to do something and be aggressive because she was just really, really playing well."" Whereas the first set lasted 70 minutes, the second went a mere 27 minutes. Cibulkova won 12 points and sent a forehand long on match point to end Li's disappointment in Melbourne. ""Finally I got her,"" Li said, referring to the trophy. On Sunday, Rafael Nadal goes for his 14th major when he faces Stanislas Wawrinka in the men's final. Nadal owns a 12-0 record against the Swiss, making his debut in a grand slam final like Cibulkova, without conceding a set. Read more: Roger Federer still can't figure out Rafael Nadal .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to the richest horse race on the European circuit, the girls are definitely beating the boys. Treve became the third successive filly to win the $5.4 million Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris on Sunday, following in the example of Solemia and Danedream, plus Zarkava in 2008. The French-bred three-year-old romped to the fifth successive race win of her career, beating Japanese favorite Orfevre by five lengths at Longchamp. Jockey Thierry Jarnet made the most of his late call-up as replacement for Frankie Dettori, who broke his ankle on Wednesday, as the 46-year-old captured his third Arc -- and first since 1994. ""It was a different era when I was riding for Andre Fabre and I'm just pleased to show I can still be effective,"" Jarnet said. ""This is beautiful, more in a way for the filly than for myself, as I have a strong affinity with her."" Trained by Criquette Head-Maarek, who in 1979 became the first woman to prepare an Arc winner, Treve is owned by Qatar's Sheikh Joaan Bin Hamad Al Thani. ""I want to say thank you to Frankie Dettori as he rode an amazing race on her in the Prix Vermeille. I said to save her for today and he did,"" Head-Maarek said of Treve, which also won last month's Grade One warmup race to be only the sixth horse to complete that double. ""I am sorry he is not here today. The way she won was incredible. She was wide the whole way and was traveling so easily the jockey just said he just let her go. ""I'm surprised how well she won, as we've never pushed her. I thought she had six gears, but today she put the seventh one on."" Treve's connections said her triumph came despite running with ""her nose the the wind."" ""The right horse always manages to get herself out of difficult situations,"" Jarnet said. Breeder Alec Head added: ""It is extraordinary! She had the worst possible race and yet won brilliantly. What a filly! I have trained good horses, but ones like that ..."" It was another disappointment for the thousands of Japanese fans who again flocked to Longchamp, with Orfevre falling short for the second year in a row . ""Treve took off at the 350 and we couldn't follow her,"" said his Belgian jockey Christophe Soumillon. ""I was hoping she would stop, but she didn't. I'm very sorry for the Japanese fans, owners and trainers who want to win this beautiful race and keep finishing second.""

"(CNN) -- The mother had less than a minute to decide: Let her daughter go on alone and break up the family, or keep everyone together, unsure when they would ever make it out. ""No, Mommy!"" her younger daughter shrieked as the older one looked at her solemnly, eyes pleading to let her go. ""You have to decide now!"" said the uniformed attendant holding the door open, voice loud and stern. This may sound like the dramatic climax of a harrowing tale of escape, and in a sense it is. It's just one of many typical standby travel scenarios, in which passengers are faced with tough decisions in their efforts to snag unclaimed airline seats at deep discounts. There are two forms of standby travel: One covers most of us, who have paid to reserve a seat and for whatever reason find ourselves trying to get on a different flight. This includes people who get bumped from a flight and those trying to switch to a flight earlier or later in the day. Then, there are ""nonrevs,"" the term for passengers from whom the airline doesn't earn any revenue, which included the family in this particular scenario witnessed recently at the Zurich airport. This elite fellowship consists largely of airline employees, their families and acquaintances -- the mythical buddy passengers. Technically, they don't buy seat reservations. Instead, they list their names on a standby registry prioritized by relationship to the airline, giving them the chance to vie for remaining open seats after all of the paying passengers have boarded a flight. Still, the wait could be days, as another family learned last week. Curtis Saxton, his wife, and his two children, ages 13 and 4, spent five days at the Salt Lake City airport waiting for a seats on a flight home to Virginia. The family was flying on buddy passes and couldn't afford to buy seats, Saxton told CNN affiliate KTVX. Finally, after five days without a shower, they lucked out when a KTVX viewer purchased tickets for a flight home. Standby travel gets harder . With its reliance on ever-decreasing empty airline seats, standby travel appears to be going the way of free food in coach. But savvy travelers with time to spare and the right mindset are still finding ways to game the system into free and discounted flights. It's hard to quantify exactly how much standby travel has decreased in recent years, because airlines contacted by CNN would not share specific figures on nonrev travel. But interviews with several longtime standby pros suggested that it has become increasingly harder, simply because it's hard to find an empty seat. Travelers might arrive at the airport for the first flight out and wait until the last one. If returning standby, they might end up spending several extra days overseas or flying around Europe to catch connecting flights that will get them closer to home. However, a bold contingent of nonrevs remains undaunted. You can spot them at the airport watching flight information monitors like hawks, waiting for their initials to appear on the cleared list. But civility is also a requirement of standby travel as part of the airlines' terms and conditions for taking advantage of this benefit. Passengers keep a safe distance from the desk to avoid becoming a nuisance to airline staff, who are their only allies. After all, nonrevs know it's out of their hands. There's nothing anyone can do but wait and let the airline fates shine upon them if there's room and their standby priority ranking is high enough. It's not for the faint of heart, requiring a vast reserve of patience and a ""que sera, sera"" attitude. There is no guarantee of success -- often up until the very last second -- which was the scenario this family found itself in one Saturday morning in July. There was only one seat left, and there were three of them. Raising the stakes was the fact that Sunday was a blackout day, meaning whoever was left behind would have to tough it out in Zurich for two days. 'You can't be in a hurry' ""I can do it,"" the older daughter said as the other started whimpering. ""OK, yes,"" the mother said. Tears welled up her eyes as her daughter skipped toward the jetway without a second glance back. The mother choked back sobs as the door closed, and clutched her younger daughter as she wailed, ""Let me go."" ""One of the toughest things to deal with is the lack of control that you have over the whole process,"" said Albert Boquet, associate professor and chair of the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's Human Factors and Systems Department in Daytona Beach, Florida. ""You can't be in hurry and you have to be fairly philosophical about it,"" Boquet said. ""If you go in with the mindset and understanding that when things go wrong or you don't get on a specific flight or two or three, you have to be able to say this is part of the game."" There was a time when this manner of standby travel was open to anyone. If you weren't in a hurry, you could show up at the airport or call the airline ahead of time and get on the standby list, agreeing to wait until a flight had empty seats. Boquet did it as a college student in 1981, waiting at the New Orleans airport most of the day until he got a seat on a flight to London for less than half the price of a reserved seat. Even then, getting back posed a bigger problem, and Boquet waited several days before he got a flight back to New Orleans. Fewer empty seats to fill . That was before airline deregulation, which made seats cheaper and more accessible. ""Now airlines are good at filling seats,"" Boquet said. ""With Internet (travel) sites and last-minute deals and travel agents, it's very rare today to have a flight taking off, especially at a busy destination, with 15 to 20 seats empty."" The risk is great, but so are the rewards: tickets averaging less than half the cost of a reserved seat, or nothing at all for some active employees, depending on the airline. Plus if the open seat is in first class, then you could be flying first class to London for the cost of taxes. ""If one assumes the mindset that travel in general, and standby travel in particular, is akin to a game that one plays, or is a challenge that one overcomes ... then the rewards of the novelty, excitement, and fun of travel are, ironically, all the more rewarding,"" said travel expert Michael Brein, who flew standby for free in 1984 after winning United Airlines' 50 States in 50 Days contest. ""You know that there are challenges, but there are also the rewards. I think many of us implicitly expect travel difficulties inherent in going standby, so it is, in a way, a sort of 'attitude inoculation.' Somehow, knowing and expecting travel hurdles in conjunction with standby traveling -- and realizing that it is part and parcel -- is somewhat 'arming' and preparing."" Standby travel with conditions . Some airlines offer a form of standby to customers who have already purchased a seat reservation. It's called same-day standby travel, but it sounds more like changing your flight on the same day without paying a fee. It's often restricted to members of loyalty programs and even then, sometimes only to high-priority travelers. Alaska Airlines' ""Free Same Day Standby"" program for an alternate flight is available on departure day to certain customers and those traveling between specific cities. Otherwise, anyone else can request same day standby for a fee while checking in online or at the airport. Or you can just call and pay to change your flight, which is what many people end up doing to curtail the uncertainty. Some airlines still offer standby revenue travel in limited circumstances. AirTran offers traditional standby tickets through its ""AirTran U"" program, in which passengers 18 to 22 years old can call or go the airport and agree to wait until a seat opens up on a flight. One airline with less restrictions is JetBlue, which allows all passengers the option of listing standby within 24 hours of a reserved flight for travel between the same cities. Passengers may travel one flight earlier than the scheduled departure on the same day, except when traveling out of a city with one daily flight. Then, you can try to get on the flight the day before. Of course, ""Standby travel is based on seat availability and is not guaranteed,"" JetBlue says on its website. A cheaper flight, by necessity . ""People who do standby travel normally do so out of necessity rather than choice. For most of us, traveling standby is anxiety-inducing, stressful,"" said Brein. ""It takes increasingly 'rare' people who are equipped to be able to cope with the potentially ever-increasing chaotic mess of their travel-lives that results from standby travel."" Having a backup plan helps, he said, like knowing whether you plan to sleep in the airport or to get a room. Sometimes, travelers find another city to fly out of, leading to all kinds of adventures and misadventures. But those are tales for another day.","As empty airline seats become rarer, standby travel is getting harder to swing .

"(CNN) -- Asia's first grand slam singles champion Li Na has called time on her 15-year tennis career due to ""chronic"" knee injuries. The current world No. 6 won the French Open in 2011 and the Australian Open in 2014 as well as helping popularize the sport in Asia. ""It took me several agonizing months to finally come to the decision that my chronic injuries will never again let me be the tennis player that I can be,"" said Li on her Facebook page. ""Walking away from the sport, effective immediately, is the right decision for me and my family."" Paying tribute to Li'is successful career, WTA chairman and chief executive officer Stacey Allaster highlighted the Chinese star's help in raising tennis' profile in Asia. ""She is a pioneer who opened doors to tennis for hundreds of millions of people throughout China and Asia,"" said Allaster in a statement. ""It's hard to be a household name in a nation with 1.4 billion people, but that's what Li Na is,"" added Allaster. ""Her legacy is immense and I have no doubt that her contributions to the WTA will be seen for decades to come in China, throughout Asia and the rest of the world."" World number one Serena Williams also paid her own tribute. ""Your retirement is a sad day for tennis but I'm sure your future will be bright. The star you left on our sport will never dim. Thank you for always making everyone smile,"" she wrote on her Facebook page. As well as her two grand slam triumphs, the 32-year-old Li reached the Australian Open final in 2011 and 2013. After her 2014 win in Melbourne, she became world No. 2 in February -- the highest ranking ever attained by an Asian player. However, an injury to her right knee forced Li to withdraw from April's Stuttgart Open, and the 32-year-old has struggled with her form since. It was a knee injury that forced her to miss the recent U.S. Open. ""After four knee surgeries and hundreds of shots injected into my knee weekly to alleviate swelling and pain, my body is begging me to stop the pounding,"" Li added on her Facebook page. ""My previous three surgeries were on my right knee. My most recent knee surgery took place this July and was on my left knee. ""While I've come back from surgery in the past, this time it felt different. As hard as I tried to get back to being 100%, my body kept telling me that, at 32, I will not be able to compete at the top level ever again. ""The sport is just too competitive, too good, to not be 100%."" Li, who played in three Olympics for China and retires having earned $16.7 million in prize money, has no plans to completely sever her links with tennis. ""We're putting together various plans on how we will continue to grow the sport of tennis in China,"" she said. ""These plans include opening the Li Na Tennis Academy, which will provide scholarships for the future generation of Chinese tennis stars. ""I will also stay involved in the Right to Play, an organization dedicated to helping underprivileged children overcome challenges through sport.""","Chinese tennis star Li Na retires at age of 32 due to injury .

"(CNN) -- A Connecticut woman who had her face destroyed by a friend's pet chimpanzee was denied permission Friday to sue the state for $150 million, according to the Office of the Claims Commissioner. The state had the authority to remove the chimp from its owner years ago, but neglected to, an attorney for Charla Nash argued. The attack left Nash without a nose, eyelids, lips or hands, said attorney Matthew Newman. The attack occurred in 2009 in Stamford, Connecticut, as Nash tried to help a friend coax her 14-year-old pet chimp back into the house. Travis the chimp, which had appeared in television commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, jumped on Nash and began biting and mauling her. Police later fatally shot Travis to stop the attack. Nash filed a claim in November 2009, seeking permission to sue Connecticut's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for damages, Claims Commissioner J. Paul Vance Jr. said in a memorandum of decision. Though officials sympathize with Nash, a regulatory statute does not provide a basis to sue the state, according to Jaclyn Falkowski, spokeswoman for the Office of the Attorney General. ""To decide otherwise would mean that the state simply could not afford to pass regulations intended to promote order and safety,"" she said in a statement. Two years after the attack, Nash became the third person to receive a full face transplant at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Doctors also attached two new hands, but they had to remove them a few days later after she fell ill. Nash is now considering her next step, her attorney said. ""Our only option is to ask the Connecticut General Assembly to review the claim commissioner's decision,"" Newman said. Family spokesman Ara Chekmayan said: ""We feel that the state Department of Environmental Protection failed to protect Charla from a known danger and today she has been denied the right to seek compensation for the catastrophic and irreversible damage inflicted upon her.""

"(CNN) -- At first glance, the UAE seems ill-suited to ice hockey. The country boasts summer temperatures of up to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius), and the only snow and ice to be found is usually in fabricated form in a shopping mall. Despite the country's many disadvantages in championing the cold-weather sport, in 2010 the UAE became the first Arab nation to play in an International Ice Hockey Federation world championship. Granted, they finished last, but that hasn't dampened the enthusiasm of the handful of Emiratis who have taken to the sport. ""I feel so proud, so proud to be representing the country,"" says Mohamed Aref Al Jachi, a founding member of the UAE's national ice hockey team. The first time Al Jachi saw snow was five years ago. Now, he trains with his team four nights a week at the Abu Dhabi ice rink. Coaches from Canada and Belarus -- two ice hockey heavyweight nations -- are helping the team learn the right moves. The process isn't always straightforward. ""It will take time to teach,"" admits Lee Becker, the team's equipment manager, who hails from Canada. ""It's not something that's going to happen overnight. They have to take some time to adapt."" Some of the players admit that they don't always get taken seriously, being from the UAE. ""They sometimes say, 'Ah, you're a desert country. Where do you play? In the desert?' Come on!"" says Saeed Al Nuaimi, a business student who plays on the team in his spare time. Despite the players' enthusiasm, the fan base hasn't yet developed around the sport. At a recent regional tournament in which they played against Mongolia, the stadium seats were mostly empty. ""It feels bad,"" admits Al Nuaimi. ""But this game is not really popular in the UAE. People like football. But if they came to watch, it's a very fast and tough game, and they would enjoy it."" For many of the players, ice hockey is, at the moment, a side hobby. Al Jachi, for instance, has a day job as a government employee. And while many of the players harbor Olympic ambitions, for the time being, they're just happy to be playing. ""You don't have to win every time,"" says Al Jachi. ""Many teams play in the world championships and they never win, but they're still playing. They are saying, 'We are there, we can play the game.' This is our aim.""","UAE became first Arab nation to play an International Ice Hockey Federation world championship .

"(CNN) -- Recep Tayyip Erdogan was officially sworn in as Turkey's new president Thursday after comfortably winning the country's first direct vote to decide its head of state earlier this month. The appointment could see the 60-year-old former semi-professional football player remain at the top of Turkish politics for at least another decade. Erdogan was elected as prime minister of Turkey three times between 2003 and 2014 but the internal rules of his Freedom and Justice Party (AK) prevented him from running for the position again. While the presidential role is designed to be a ceremonial one -- akin to that held by the Queen in the United Kingdom -- Erdogan has already indicated a desire to change the constitution that will see his remit extended. But how do businesses on the ground feel about Turkey's future and Erdogan's continuing role in front line politics? Foreign direct investment surged tenfold from just $20 billion in 2001 to over $200 billion today while massive infrastructure projects like Istanbul's Marmaray Tunnel were completed under Erdogan's watch. However, growth has slowed to just over 2% in recent years and international ratings agencies such as Moody's and Fitch have cautioned investors over political and social unrest within the country. CNN's John Defterios spoke with Besir Ustaoglu, President of the American-Turkish Chamber of Commerce, about the prospects for the emerging market economy, with its 80 million consumers. He started by asking whether he was concerned by Turkey's slower rate of growth in recent years. Besir Ustaoglu (BU): We have been growing quite rapidly in the last ten years. (But) nowadays the economy is slowing down, you are right. We should be expecting to see a growth rate of 3% to 3.5% in the next few years. John Defterios (JD): This is a difficult time because of the unrest in Iraq which could last a few years. You have the challenges to the south in Syria, and Europe is slowing down again. Where do you get your export growth? BU: Well the neighboring countries in the southern part of Turkey, Iraq and Syria were our main partners for export in the old days -- actually being the main gateway to the Middle East Markets. Going through Syria, Turkey was exporting to almost a dozen markets. You are right, it has stopped and now the European Union is going through recession. Hopefully the United States and the European Union is working on the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) project. Turkey is a partner and is exporting to both the EU and the United States. JD: Years ago though, Mr Erdogan was touting great growth to the Middle East and Africa. Africa is still in play but the Middle East is very chaotic. This is really going to undermine the prospects for the next few years, isn't it? BU: Of course after the Arab Spring, in northern Africa -- where Turkey had so many contractors in Libya, in Egypt and Algeria -- this also didn't help the Turkish economy. I hope in the near future all these conflicts will be resolved and again Turkish contractors will again take their place in these countries. JD: You've had Mr Erdogan in office as prime minister for almost a dozen years. He could be in power (as president) for another ten years. Does this not concern you, that there's a centralization of power under one personality and one individual? BU: Not really, because if you look at it Turkey has had its best time in terms of economics and social welfare in the last 12 years. Since November 3, 2002, things have been really growing. (That's) a good track record of a dozen years, as you say, of managing the country and (managing) relations (with the likes) of Europe and the United States. I think Mr Erdogan (should be) given a chance to see what happens in his presidency. JD: It's interesting to see the ratings agencies, particularly Fitch and Moody's, are putting a question mark over domestic political challenges. Do you think that's fair? BU: I don't think so. If you look at the Turkish economy we have our own dynamics. If you look at production, it is increasing. Unemployment is not so bad. We have an average age of 29, it is a big consumer market. So ratings institutes, I don't know why they are trying to reduce the ratings of Turkey.","Recep Tayyip Erdogan sworn in as new president of Turkey .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When it comes to Sharia-compliant banking, few Western countries can compete with Britain. One of the world's prime financial centers, the City of London is also the key Western hub for Islamic banking. The IBB opened its doors in 2004 and became the UK's first and only standalone Islamic high street bank. With 23 banks, nine fund managers and a number of international law firms offering Islamic finance in the City, by 2006 British Sharia-compliant assets were thought to be in the region of $22 billion. The global industry has trebled in the past decade and is now worth around $531 billion. Britain is also in the vanguard when it comes to Sharia-compliant retail banking, catering for its population of approximately three million Muslims. In 2004, the Islamic Bank of Britain (IBB) opened its doors for the first time, becoming the UK's first and only standalone Islamic high street bank. A number of Britain's ""big five"" high street banks are getting in on the act. Lloyds TSB and HSBC offer Islamic banking, including mortgages, current accounts and trust funds for children. In the retail market, Britain is the only European country that offers government-authorized Islamic banking products. In the United States, only regional banks like University Bank, Michigan offer Sharia-compliant products. Authorities and regulators in France -- despite having a Muslim population twice the size of Britain's at six million -- have been slow to realize the potential of this sector. ""In France, Islamic finance is at an embryonic stage. They are where we were three or four years ago,"" Sultan Choudhury, the IBB's director of sales told the Financial Times. British mosques dating back 150 years attest to the long connection between the United Kingdom and Muslims, but it is the British government's staunch support of the sector -- backing words with legislative changes -- that has responded to the needs of Muslims in the financial world. Junaid Bhatti, who was involved with the setup of the IBB, told CNN: ""Government is a firm supporter of the industry down to amending legislation to create a level playing field for Islamic banking."" The British sector is currently experiencing phenomenal growth of around 20 percent per year compared with global growth of around 15 percent. Industry insiders feel there is still scope for continued growth. Aktar Ahmed of Lloyds TSB Islamic finance told CNN: ""Islamic finance is still in its infancy at the moment. We're seeing a fantastic rate of growth both globally and here in the UK."" Lloyds TSB now offers Sharia-compliant banking at all of its 2,000 UK branches. Services include an Islamic current account, mortgage and child trust fund. Islamic mortgages have proved particularly successful in Britain, with the market growing from barely a trickle in 2003 to a value of $1.7 billion in 2007. But Islamic banking in the United States is suffering from an image problem. Many Americans are felt to be hostile to the concept after the 9/11 attacks, equating it with ""terrorist finance."" ""There seems to be this misperception out there that the U.S. is perhaps Islamophobic,"" said Abdi Shayesteh, an attorney at law firm King and Spalding, which has had a practice dedicated to Islamic banking and finance since the 1980s. ""The U.S. regulators have been supportive and they've accommodated Islamic banking and finance since the mid 80s,"" Shayesteh told CNN. With a best-guess figure of six million Muslims in the United States of whom around 60 percent are devout (and therefore likely to use Islamic banking services), Shayesteh considers domestic Sharia-compliant banking an untapped market. ""We have at least 3.6 million [potential customers] at the very base level market opportunity for banks from abroad and here to tap into,"" he explained. Even so, with constitutional limits on promoting any one religion over another, which keeps legislators quiet about the opportunities, and no sign that any major American banks will be rolling out Islamic products, the market remains unexploited for now.

"Washington (CNN) -- In an extended shutdown, most of the federal workforce would go without pay, but the checks will keep coming to the 533 current members of Congress. Who gets paid in a shutdown and who doesn't? ""That is disgraceful in my view,"" said freshman Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, told CNN. ""Basically the only people who get paid in a shutdown are members of Congress, and that is irresponsible."" Gabbard plans to send any pay she receives during a shutdown back to the Treasury. The combat veteran said she was shocked to find out recently that members' pay is protected. It is -- by the Constitution. Opinion: Taxpayers, you deserve your money back . The 27th Amendment to the Constitution restricts any Congress from changing its own pay. The measure was proposed in the first days of the Republic but was not ratified until 1992, after a grass-roots movement promoted the idea and the necessary number of state legislatures approved it. While many may have wanted to restrain Congress from increasing its pay, the amendment also blocks Congress from freezing or cutting its compensation. The result? Congress gets paid no matter what. Gabbard is not the only member surprised. The list: What's open, what's closed . ""I don't even know whether it stops or not,"" Rep. John Fleming, R-Louisiana, said when asked about his pay during a shutdown. When told that the Constitution mandates congressional paychecks stay as-is, Fleming responded that he hadn't thought through what he would do yet but would likely donate his pay during a shutdown to charity. ""Obviously we need to share the pain of the American people,"" he concluded. The offices for the top two members of Congress -- House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -- wouldn't respond to specifics about their pay. According to a report by the Lexington Herald-Leader newspaper, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, plans to donate his salary to charity during the shutdown. Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Texas, told CNN he is urging his fellow members of Congress to donate their pay to charitable causes. ""I don't think we should get paid until (the shutdown) is resolved,"" Rep. Pete DeSantis, R-Fla, told CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday. ""I've asked the clerk to withhold any pay for me until we get this up and running. I just think that that's fair for the folks involved who've been negatively affected by this."" House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, disagreed with DeSantis. ""I think that's another game (House Republicans) want to play, appealing to a demagogic approach to this,"" Hoyer told Tapper on Tuesday. Shutdown 'extremely damaging' to U.S. intelligence operations . ""Members of Congress ought to be on the job working hard,"" Hoyer added, ""getting this job done to the American people, getting their government opened, getting federal employees back to work and serving the public, serving the growth of our economy, serving our national security ends."" While members will get paid, they must decide which of their own office staff have to go home. Members of Congress run their own office payroll and will decide who is essential and non essential. But even congressional staff members who work during a shutdown would not get paid until later -- only their bosses will get paid on time. ""My staffers are working with pay. Right now,"" Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, said Tuesday on ""Crossfire."" ""They're doing oversight on the federal government. ... They're continuing to work on the waste."" Coburn also said he's keeping his salary earned during the shutdown. ""I'm going to keep my salary and going to make sure I spend it and tithe it and give to it charities and do the thing that I've always done. ... I'm not going to stop working."" But Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, who appeared alongside Coburn on ""Crossfire"" on Tuesday, is taking a different approach. ""Eighty percent of my staff, unfortunately, is on furlough,"" she said, ""I'm going to be contributing [my salary] on a daily basis. For every day we are not seeing an open -- a government that's open, I'm contributing."" Americans hurt as DC 'squabbles like kids' CNN's Athena Jones, Tasha Diakides, and Martina Stewart contributed to this report.","NEW: Some in Congress say they're planning on giving their pay to charity during shutdown .

"(CNN) -- L'Wren Scott, a notable fashion designer and longtime girlfriend of Mick Jagger, killed herself by ""hanging,"" New York City's chief medical examiner's office announced Wednesday. ""The manner of death was determined to be suicide,"" said Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the office. Scott's remains have been claimed, according to Bolcer, though it was not immediately known by whom. Wednesday's announcement makes official what was suspected after news came out about the 49-year-old woman's death. Business woes may have triggered suicide . A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation earlier said Scott's assistant -- after responding to a text to ""come by"" -- found the designer hanging from a door knob with a scarf around her neck on Monday morning. The lanky former model transitioned to become a stylist and eventually a designer. She designed costumes for films such as the 1996 remake of ""Diabolique,"" 2000's ""Mercy"" and 2007's ""Ocean's Thirteen."" In addition to her haute couture creations, she designed a collection for Banana Republic that was introduced late last year. Madonna, Allison Williams and Christina Hendricks were among her celebrity clients. But she was most closely associated with Jagger, 70 -- not just for designing the iconic rocker's duds for the Rolling Stones' 50th anniversary tour, which began in 2012, but for being his longtime companion. The couple had been dating since at least 2003. ""I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way,"" read a statement on the singer's website, MickJagger.com.

"(CNN) -- A Florida resident and cousin of a Palestinian teenager killed in Jerusalem this week is the young man seen in separate videos being held down and pummeled by men in the uniform of Israeli security forces, relatives said. Tariq Khdeir, 15, a high school sophomore in Tampa, was visiting his Palestinian relatives in Jerusalem for the first time in over a decade when he was attacked and detained, family members told CNN. Tariq, born in Baltimore, was outside the home of his cousin, who was kidnapped and killed on Wednesday in an incident that has further stoked tensions between Palestinians and Israelis. The tensions already had risen sharply after three Israeli teens were found dead in the West Bank. Autopsy: Palestinian teen was burned alive . The two videos, which were posted independently, say the beating occurred on Thursday. In Tampa, Tariq's aunt, Sanah Abukhdeir, said the boy was visiting his grandmother, who is on her deathbed. The teen's mother identified him in the video by the clothing he was wearing, including an Ecko T-shirt, his aunt said. ""Send our boy home,"" she said, expressing concern about the medical attention he was receiving. ""He's pure American."" An uncle who is in regular contact with the boy's parents said the family was told Tariq was shackled to a hospital bed. After being treated in a hospital, he was moved to a detention center. ""It's unbelievable how they kicked him,"" the uncle said of the beating. Tariq is a typical teenager who takes lots of selfies and enjoys fishing, according to his family. Among his friends, his nickname is ""Fish,"" after his favorite hobby. 'A very serious incident' The Israeli Defense Forces issued a statement Saturday seeking to distance themselves from the beating. ""It seems that the Israel Police Forces were involved in the incident, and not the IDF Forces,"" the statement said. In a statement, the Justice Ministry said the government's legal adviser will investigate the videotaped beating in the Shuafat neighborhood. Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni is quoted in the statement as saying the images ""show a very serious incident by uniformed personnel, while this is not the Israeli's law enforcement policy -- yet sadly, they are the ones headlining worldwide news."" 'Am I going to hear him screaming?' CNN's Ben Wedeman spoke to Tariq's mother, Suha Abu Khdeir, who said she just couldn't watch the video of the beating. ""I don't want to see the video, I don't want to hear the video,"" she said. ""I don't want to hear it. I don't know what I am going to hear. Am I going to hear him screaming? Am I going to hear him calling for help?"" She said she visited her son in the hospital, but he remains in custody. She did not know why he was arrested. She and the boy's father, Salah Eddeine Abu Khdeir, said the teenager was among people protesting the death of his cousin, but wasn't involved in the clashes with Israeli security forces. ""I asked my son, 'Did you throw rocks?' He said no,"" his father said. ""He didn't have to throw rocks, he's just a Palestinian, in front of his neighborhood, hanging out with his relatives,"" Tariq's mother said. Complaints of rough treatment . Palestinians have long complained of rough treatment by the Israeli police and double standards when it comes to justice, says Bill van Esveld of Human Rights Watch. ""The concern is that we've got plenty of evidence that this child of 15 was brutally beaten by Israeli law enforcement,"" van Esveld told CNN. ""And instead of the law enforcement officials responsible for the beating being questioned and detained, the child who is the victim is being questioned and detained."" One neighbor shot a video of the beating and distributed it to family and a television station. Another video was shot from the other side of the street and posted to YouTube. Relatives watched the video and told CNN that the teen is Tariq Khdeir. Relatives released pictures of the bruised teenager with swelling on his lips and nose. The men delivered more than 20 blows to the youth over a period of two minutes. He did not appear to be struggling and police carried away his limp body afterward. Both videos start after the incident began, and it's not clear why Khdeir was attacked. 'That should not happen' Mark Regev, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said he had seen the videos on CNN. ""I think people who have that video should take it straight to the Israeli police,"" he said. ""There is a separate department in our Ministry of Justice who will investigate that sort of thing."" Regev said he did not know the details of this case. ""That should not happen,"" he said. ""Obviously, it is forbidden under Israeli law to beat up a suspect who is in handcuffs."" ""It's attempted murder,"" Suha Abu Khdeir said of her son's beating. Calls for U.S. to intervene . Khdeir's father told CNN that a U.S. consular officer visited the teen in a Israeli detention center in Jerusalem. The officer told Khdeir's father that the teen does not remember much of what happened during his arrest. The officer passed on a note from Tariq in which he said he was OK and told his parents not to worry about him, according to the uncle who is in regular contact with the parents. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called the reports ""troubling"" and called for a ""speedy, transparent and credible investigation and full accountability for any excessive use of force."" The Council on American-Islamic Relations urged the United States to help free the teen. ""It is the duty of American officials to intervene and secure the release of an American citizen who was so viciously attacked,"" said Hassan Shibly, executive director of CAIR-Florida. Khdeir is expected to appear at the Jerusalem magistrate court at 11 a.m. Sunday (4 a.m. ET), according to his father. His cousin, Mohammed Abu Khedair, who was abducted and killed in Jerusalem this week, died from being burned alive and hit on the head with a blunt object, according to Palestinian General Prosecutor Mohammed al-Auwewy, citing a medical autopsy. Al-Auwewy said the autopsy discovered traces of smoke inside the lungs of the 16-year-old, indicating that it was inhaled while the fire was burning. After the teen's funeral on Friday, more than 60 people were injured in clashes with Israeli security forces in parts of Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian Medical Relief Society, a group that said it was involved in evacuating injured Palestinians. It said the injuries mostly involved rubber bullets fired at the upper body and chest. CNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this story.","NEW: A note from the detained boy tells his parents he is OK and not to worry, an uncle says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- She's not gonna make it. We give her 24 hours. Apryl Brown remembers lying on the hospital bed as the doctor uttered those words. A sense of relief came over her. ""I didn't think about losing my children. I didn't think about leaving my mother,"" she said. She thought instead of how death would feel. ""Although I will be dead, I will not be in pain anymore."" That searing pain came from an unimaginable source: a silicone filler, like the one Brown assumed plastic surgeons use daily. Hers was injected into her buttocks, with the hope of improving her appearance. Brown never predicted the injections would land her here -- dying in a hospital bed in June 2010. Her body was shutting down from a staph infection that doctors said was connected to the silicone injections. Her limbs were curling and turning black, the visible signs of necrosis. Brown recalled seeing her hands in the hospital, thinking, ""Oh, my God. I am going to lose my hands. I looked at my feet ,and they were dead, too."" Doctors had no choice. To save Brown's life, they amputated her hands, feet and the flesh around her buttocks and hips in 27 surgeries. Somehow, she survived. Brown is still embarrassed as she talks about the vanity that nearly cost her everything. Living a good life, except for a flat 'flaw' At the time, she was a successful hair stylist and owned a salon. When she wasn't at her shop, she was busy raising two daughters. Life was good. But Brown always wanted to fix what she saw as her ""flaw."" Ever since she was a little girl growing up in Florida, Brown remembers being teased about having a flat butt. Growing up, she always wanted a fuller posterior and even had a mantra, ""When I get me some money, I am going to get me some butt."" In 2004, while she was working on a new client's hair, she got her chance. The client happened to mention she did silicone injections cheaply. With a few sessions, she told Brown, she could obtain the shape she had always wanted. Brown was sold. A week later, she found herself in a house lying down in a bedroom receiving her first of four injections into her butt cheeks. Following her second treatment, Brown remembers doubting her decision. ""A voice just came to me like, 'What are you doing? Are you serious? You are going to allow somebody to inject something into your body and you have no idea what it is.'"" Brown decided that day to stop doing the treatments and never went back. The true cost of the injections would come later, following years of pain and visits with doctors. Brown's story may be severe, but she is part of what the American Society of Plastic Surgeons calls a growing problem: patients bypassing doctors just to save some money on basic medical procedures. ""I think that's awfully seductive to a person who doesn't know there's a problem,"" said Dr. Richard Glogau, a clinical professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Francisco. He says he is seeing a disturbing trend, as patients turn to plastic surgeons such as him after getting botched facial filler injections. The injections are used to smooth out facial lines. Some of the patients Glogau sees have traveled out of country and had these cosmetic procedures done cheaply. Others are purchasing cosmetic fillers from websites and self-injecting these dermal fillers into their faces. Often, the patients have no idea what's in the dermal filler, nor do they receive the procedure from a licensed medical professional. ""People assume it's just as easy as getting your hair colored, and at the end of the day it's a medical procedure,"" Glogau said. Would-be patients need to know the facts . In the United States, there are only 21 FDA approved dermal fillers. These must be administered by a medical provider or under the supervision of a physician. None of the FDA-approved dermal filler devices is approved for self-injection. There are hundreds of nonapproved dermal fillers available around the world. But Glogau cautions against having the procedure done out of country or trying to do it yourself. ""I wouldn't do it. I think you belong in a doctor's office where a physician is supervising this and you can depend on where they have sourced the material."" As far as buying it online, Glogau says it's easy for patients to take the leap. ""If we live in a world where you buy your Manolo Blahniks shoes at Neiman Marcus or you can buy them online at Zappos and it's the same shoe, I think you're expecting what you see on a website as full value and true."" One of his recent patients came to him after purchasing a non-FDA-approved dermal filler marketed on the Internet with just a credit card and a stroke of the keys. In a few days, the cosmetic filler she purchased from the website PMMA.com arrived postmarked from Brazil. She had her friend, who was a registered nurse, inject her face with the dermal filler. A week later, her cheeks started to react. Glogau says it appeared that there were ""red, angry nodules in the cheeks."" He had to surgically drain the area, which had ""lakes of pus under the skin,"" and excise the material from her cheeks. After the surgery, Glogau had the material from her face tested. The UCSF dermatopathology results showed there was some type of ""refractile material"" found in her cheeks. Glogau describes the material as low-grade ""glass or fiberglass."" The patient's body was rejecting that material. After repeated attempts by CNN to contact PMMA.com for a comment about selling non-FDA-approved dermal fillers on its website, PMMA e-mailed, ""It has nothing to do with the product but the procedure."" Two days later, when CNN went to PMMA.com, all that appeared was a blank white screen and the words: ""Access denied."" Scars are a reminder of a bad decision . While Glogau's patient is on the road to recovery, she will always have some visible scars on her face. Glogau has a warning to people considering purchasing dermal fillers themselves. ""What we want to do is at least make the patients aware that there is a danger lurking for them out there, and they have to be careful,"" says Glogau. Brown considers herself a living example of what happens when you're not careful. She doesn't hesitate to tell others about how she suffered in extreme pain for five long years after the silicone injections. She explains how she watched her buttocks harden and discolor, seeing doctor after doctor to try to get help. She lifts what's left of her arms and explains what was actually injected in her buttocks. When her doctors tested the substance injected into her body, Brown says it was bathroom caulk. Brown doesn't know what happened to the woman who injected her. At 47, Brown has had to learn to do everything all over again with prosthetics. She is able to live on her own with the help of an aide who comes in to help her for a few hours a day. She doesn't want pity; she wants people to listen to her cautionary story. ""All I would ask them to do is, when you have that first thought, make sure they have a second thought about it and do a little research. And if they still want to do it, go for it. They won't be blindsided, saying, 'Oh, my God, I had no idea that a simple procedure like that can leave me with no hands, no feet and no butt cheeks.'"" Brown has a new mission in life to spread the word about what happened to her and a different mantra: ""We are enough and we were made to be enough.""

"(CNN) -- What divorce rumors? Say what you will about superstar couple Beyonce and Jay Z, but they appear determined to keep fans guessing. The conversation swirling around them has gone from ""Are they over?"" to ""Are they overjoyed about an addition to their family?"" As the pair wrapped up their very successful ""On The Run"" tour in Paris over the weekend, there was speculation that Beyonce may be pregnant with their second child, a marked turn from the breakup chatter that surrounded the pair at the start of the tour in June. So how did the narrative switch so rapidly? Apparently with very little help from Mr. and Mrs. Carter. Much as they did with the split rumors, the couple have remained mum about a potential new baby. Instead, fans have turned to their ""On the Run"" concerts for clues, indulging in a guessing game that's continued through the very last show. Rumors of trouble in paradise started after the now infamous elevator incident in May. After Beyonce's sister, Solange, was shown on surveillance video fighting her rapper brother-in-law after the Met Gala in New York City, there were whispers that divorce was on the horizon. Yet Beyonce and Jay never responded directly to the gossip about a breakup. Instead, they released a statement following the elevator incident saying they were united as a family and announced their first joint tour with a star-studded trailer portraying them as an outlaw couple. Incidentally, the controversy did nothing to hamper the launch of their stadium tour; ""On the Run,"" which had 16 dates in North America and two in Paris, reportedly went on to gross more than $100 million. As the pair wound their way through their dates, every onstage interaction was picked apart for hints about their offstage relationship. There was the time when Beyonce changed the lyrics to her song ""Resentment,"" about a faithless lover, to say ""been ridin' with you for 12 years"" -- the amount of time she and her husband have been together. She then stepped it up another notch with a remix of her song ""Flawless,"" in which she sang, ""Of course sometimes s**t goes down when there's a billion dollars on an elevator."" (Beyonce and Jay Z have consistently been named among the top-earning couples in the music industry.) Concertgoers were left to make their own decisions about what, if anything, was happening behind the scenes. During the show, scenes of the pair as outlaws flashed on the screen along with the words, ""This Is Not Real."" During their rendition of ""Young Forever,"" the couple shared never-before-seen video of their wedding, family time and vacations with the words, ""This Is Real."" At the same time, there were reports -- like a July item in the New York Post titled ""Inside the crumbling marriage of Jay Z and Beyonce"" -- which claimed that the pair were now more business arrangement than happy couple. But apparently someone forgot to tell the Carters that. They appeared to be very much together in August when Beyonce gave an energetic 16-minute performance at the MTV Video Music Awards as her husband and daughter, Blue Ivy, supported her from the audience. Jay Z and Blue then took the stage to present the singer with the MTV Michael Jackson Vanguard Award, and the family shared a tender hug on stage, causing even further head-scratching among some fans. And then came their last ""On the Run"" show in Paris on September 13. Us Weekly reports that Beyonce got emotional, wiping away tears as she said to her husband, ""I love you so much"" before asking the audience to ""Give it up for Mr. Carter"" (which is Jay Z's legal name). There has been no word from the Carter camp as to whether there is a blessed event on the way or not. That's not unexpected, given that the couple have been notoriously private about their personal life, taking years to even acknowledge that they were a couple. They have been only slightly more open during their six-year marriage. The only sure thing is that fans will be able to see more of them on September 20. That's when their HBO ""On the Run"" concert special premieres.","Divorce talk has now been replaced by baby rumors .

"(CNN) -- I know whose house I would avoid on Halloween if I lived in Fargo, North Dakota. Instead of handing out candy, a local woman called into a radio station, saying she plans to pass out letters to trick-or-treaters she feels are ""moderately obese."" How do you say killjoy? ""I just want to send a message to the parents of kids that are really overweight,"" said the woman, who identified herself only as Cheryl, during an interview with WDAY-FM radio in Fargo. ""I think it's just really irresponsible of parents to just sort of send them out looking for free candy just 'cause all of the other kids are doing it,"" she said. Since news of such a Halloween plan went viral, people have called CNN affiliate KXJB-TV questioning whether the story is a hoax, according to the station. But ""Rat,"" WDAY-FM's morning co-host, told CNN it was definitely not a radio station stunt. ""The woman Cheryl did call into our show,"" he said. ""We have been unable to get her back on the phone."" It remains unclear if the woman truly plans to hand out obesity letters or if this was all a prank. ""Whether Cheryl goes through with handing out letters or not seems to be a Halloween mystery,"" said JT Thaden, brand manager for WDAY-FM. ""If any local children do get a letter, we're encouraging them to stop by (our) studios and we'll exchange it for a piece of candy."" The radio station said the woman e-mailed it the following message for parents: ""Your child is, in my opinion, moderately obese and should not be consuming sugar and treats to the extent of some children this Halloween season. ""My hope is that you will step up as a parent and ration candy this Halloween and not allow your child to continue these unhealthy eating habits."" Her goal, she said in the interview, is spurring action to battle a communitywide problem. ""Their kids are everybody's kids. It's a whole village,"" she said. CNN iReport contributor Tony Posnanski said he was motivated to write a response of his own after hearing about what he calls the ""fat-shaming letter."" ""Any kind of fat letter is just a shame. It doesn't solve anything, it just shames people,"" he said in his iReport. Prank or not, Posnanski said the whole concept could still affect people. ""It can influence others to send in fat letters, too. When I was a child, I was overweight. I think the more that people pointed it out, it only put me through hell."" Posnanski said he plans to hand out his own positive letter along with Halloween candy to trick-or-treaters, pointing out how ""awesome"" they are. ""I don't think (my letter) is going to affect kids or parents, but it is better than handing out fat letters. This is a holiday for kids to have fun; this isn't a holiday for candy,"" he said. Plenty of people in my social community had some other choice words. ""This is despicable,"" said Sue Scheff, author of the book ""Wit's End: Advice and Resources for Saving Your Out-of-Control Teen,"" on Facebook. ""Talk about giving a child a complex and deflating their self-esteem especially in front of their peers."" ""Holy cr*p! This is just plain mean,"" said Sarah Winer Maizes of Los Angeles, a children's book author and blogger, also on Facebook. ""It's just plain heartless. Can we videotape someone giving her a 'you're a heinous creature of a human being' note?"" ""This is terrible, particularly for the girls already overly concerned about body image,"" said new mom Katie Resnick Lamoureux of Hyannis, Massachusetts. Opinion: 'Fat letters' from schools to parents are wrong . Lynn Grefe, president and CEO of the National Eating Disorders Association, agrees, saying such a concept, along with letters from schools to parents about a child's body mass index, would be the wrong way to go. ""So-called 'fat letters' have no place in schools and certainly no place in our kids' Halloween buckets and bags,"" Grefe said. ""Bringing attention to a child's weight and size in this way is yet one more thoughtless approach that targets and bullies children, putting them at risk for low self-esteem and ultimately developing an eating disorder."" She added, ""Health should be assessed by a medical doctor, certainly not a stranger who might be dressed as one."" Everyone in my social networking circles was horrified by the North Dakotan's possible approach, but some also recognized there's a real problem. ""I agree that the community as a whole should support and promote healthy lifestyles because it does take a village, but this is not the way to go about it,"" said Janet Abrams Piechota on Facebook. Said a reader who goes by the Twitter handle @nunoc3, ""Wrong strategy for a real problem."" ""Maybe she should just give out healthy snacks to all,"" @patgee59 tweeted. ""Don't be the fat monitor."" Yes, she can join the small number of families (less than 5% according to a poll for a story I did a few years back) who give out healthy snacks -- raisins, fruit, even toothbrushes and dental floss on Halloween. Like the woman in North Dakota, I guess these families also have good intentions, but come on, folks, it's Halloween. Mike Adamick, a stay-at-home dad in San Francisco, had another idea. ""I want to hand out letters to people who hand out raisins or dental floss ... although with a kid there, I suppose the correct response would be, 'Thank you.' Still, killjoys,"" said the blogger and author of the book, ""Dad's Book of Awesome Projects."" I agree, which is why I sent my children to school with what my husband called an ""unconscionable"" amount of candy in small baggies to give out to their friends. Now I just hope their moms don't send me a letter.

"(CNN) -- A few months before her second birthday, a small bump about the size of a pimple appeared on Audriana Willman's right leg. Her parents, Andrew and Chelsea, noticed the boil in the evening, as they prepared their daughter for bed. ""We had already been through this three other times, so we weren't too worried,"" explains Chelsea, who says she had taken her daughter to a pediatrician on several occasions to treat skin infections. As they usually did when a little red circle with a white head appeared on their toddler's body, they popped it like a pimple and cleaned the area with antibacterial soap. But this time, that small pimple would turn into a major problem. ""By the next morning, it wasn't just a bump anymore. Her leg was red and extremely swollen, and she could hardly walk. She was in pain, and her fever had spiked to 103,"" her mother recalls. ""It went from minor to really, really bad overnight."" By 10:30 that morning, they had rushed Audriana to their pediatrician in Oroville, California. She was hospitalized, and the Willmans learned their daughter had developed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, which is a type of staph bacterium that does not respond to commonly used antibiotic treatments. This type of infection has been a problem in hospital settings for many years, but starting around 2000, it began steadily making its way into the lives of otherwise healthy people, especially children, who are not typically at risk for the fast-moving bacteria. As children head back to school, epidemiologists are encouraging parents to be more aware of the drug-resistant strain of staph and how to protect their kids. MRSA infections on the rise . ""Everyone is at risk,"" said Dr. Patrick Romano, senior author of a new report that found the number of children hospitalized with MRSA infections, mostly acquired from within the community, has more than doubled since 2000. ""MRSA really started as a bacterium that was seen in hospitals among high-risk patients. But during the last decade, we saw it spread to the general population."" ""The problem is that MRSA began to affect people who were perfectly healthy,"" adds Dr. Jaime Fergie, author of a 2005 study that concluded that infections in children had reached ""epidemic proportions."" Mutations in the organism made it more virulent and easy to transmit, he says. ""We continue to see more severe, life-threatening infections affecting the blood, lungs, muscles and even bones of previously healthy children."" In 2009, 71,900 children were hospitalized because of infections under the skin, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the CDC estimates there are approximately 10,800 deaths in the U.S. each year caused by staph, of which 5,500 are inked to MRSA. The problem became so widespread that in January, the Infectious Diseases Society of America called the condition a ""huge public health problem"" and published its first-ever guidelines for the treatment of MRSA in pediatric patients. Protecting your child from MRSA . ""We have to live with the fact that it's out there, all around us in the community. At this point, we expect a certain level of these infections,"" Romano says. ""Now, it's a matter of recognizing the early signs and treating it early when we see it."" Audriana Willman spent three days in a hospital and recovered without serious complication from her MRSA infection. Her parents say their previous experience has made them more cognizant of every little bump on their daughter. And because their daughter is prone to skin infections, they are even more vigilant about hygiene in their household. ""We learned that the hard way, how quickly they can progress. The longer we can go without them, the better,"" her mother says. As children head back to school, pediatricians are encouraging parents to become educated about MRSA to ensure that if their child gets an infection, they catch it early, before symptoms become severe. Here are 5 things parents should know: . 1. The infection site can resemble a spider bite . ""Sometimes, parents mistake [a MRSA infection] for a spider bite because it is so intense and appears so suddenly,"" said Fergie, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Driscoll Children's Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas. ""If you haven't seen a spider, don't assume it's a spider bite. If you recognize a painful red spot with a little bit of pus, that's enough of a concern to go to a doctor,"" he recommends. To help you identify the infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has compiled several images to better visualize what MRSA infections may look like. 2. The infection may start like a pimple and advance rapidly . Dr. Jennifer Shu, an Atlanta pediatrician, says parents often don't realize how quickly the infection can progress. ""This is what shocks parents the most. Something that looked like a pimple is all of a sudden the size of a nickel,"" explains Shu, who says the bacteria can spread within a matter of hours. She once saw a patient who developed more than 30 skin boils in two to three days. 3. Transmission among young athletes is prevalent . According to the National Athletic Trainers' Association, skin diseases accounted for 56% of all infectious diseases in competitive sports from 1922 through 2005. Athletes tend to share things like equipment and towels, and children engaged in high-contacts sports inevitably receive cuts, bruises and scrapes, which act as potential entryways for serious bacterial infections. Last year, the association issued a position statement on skin disease among athletes warning that after a bacterial infection, they should not be allowed to return to a game until they complete a 72-hour course of antibiotic therapy and the infection has been completely drained. The CDC offers more prevention information and advice specifically for athletes on its website. 4. Treatment for MRSA not always the first option . Romano, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Davis, says that when a child has an infection, doctors do not always start with a prescription that works against MRSA bacteria. In communities experiencing high MRSA rates, pediatricians may automatically default to medications that fight the bacteria, but they may choose not to in communities where there hasn't been an outbreak. If someone in your home or another child in your child's school recently had a MRSA infection, alert a doctor, as it may be worth asking up front for a broader-spectrum antibiotic. Pages 12-15 of the Infectious Diseases Society of America's Clinical Practice Guidelines list the treatment recommendations for adults and children based on their symptoms. Return to the pediatrician as soon as possible if within 48 hours you do not notice less swelling or redness, or if the infected area remains warm, Romano advises. 5. Bleach baths and proper cleaning can help prevent spread . If you have several children, and one of them has developed a MRSA infection, you want to keep the spread to a minimum. Experts say to keep the infected area covered with a bandage until it heals. The Willmans took the recommendation of an infectious disease specialist and gave their daughter a bleach bath using about a half-cup of bleach in about 13 gallons of water, a few times a week. There is the potential for skin irritation if the mixture is not diluted properly, so be sure to follow the guidelines outlined by the ISDA. You'll also want to clean surfaces that might come in contact with the infection. The Environmental Protection Agency offers a list of registered cleaning products that are effective against MRSA.","Kids' hospitalizations for community-acquired MRSA have doubled since 2000 .
10,800 deaths in the U.S. each year caused by staph, of which 5,500 are linked to MRSA .

"(CNN) -- Big-spending Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain have been heavily sanctioned by European football body UEFA for breaching new rules on Financial Fair Play. The respective champions of England and France are among nine clubs that have failed to comply with rulings brought in with the aim of making football more financially stable. City has been bankrolled by Abu Dhabi royal Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan since 2008, while PSG was bought by the Qatar Investment Authority in 2011. Both clubs have leaped to prominence on the back of massive investments, signing top players and announcing lucrative sponsorship deals with companies closely linked to their owners -- such as Etihad Airlines and the Qatar Tourism Authority. The latter was identified by UEFA as having broken its financial rules -- it said Friday that its valuation of PSG's reported €700 million ($960 million) four-year agreement was ""significantly below that submitted by the club."" Despite such revenue, City and PSG exceeded the permitted losses of $62 million over the course of the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons. City, which last weekend won the Premier League title for the second time in three years, said it would accept punishments including a fine of €60 million ($82 million), a restriction on transfer spending and a reduction in the club's squad size for the European Champions League. Of the fine, €10 million will be taken from earnings in this season's Champions League and the same amount from the next campaign -- while the rest will be returned if City meets its financial obligations over a three-year period. It will have to limit spending on new players to €60 million for the upcoming transfer window, on top of funds raised by sales of existing squad members. ""This will have no material impact on the club's planned transfer activity,"" City said Friday, having negotiated a settlement with UEFA in talks over the past month. ""At the heart of those discussions is a fundamental disagreement between the club's and UEFA's respective interpretations of the FFP regulations on players purchased before 2010,"" City said. ""The club believes it has complied with the FFP regulations on this and all other matters."" City, which reached the last 16 in this season's Champions League, can only register 21 players for the 2014-15 competition -- the usual maximum is 25. However, it noted that manager Manuel Pellegrini used only 21 of 23 players registered for 2013-14. The whole club's salaries -- those of its players are the largest in world sport -- for next season must stay at the same level as the one just completed, though City said: ""In reality, the existing MCFC business plan sees a natural decline in that wage bill."" City made a record British loss of $307.8 million in 2010-11 and $192 million the year before -- all of which were covered by billionaire Sheikh Mansour. In 2012 its deficit was $160 million and last year $87 million, but the club said it expects to break even for the period ending May 31. ""Operating with no debt, the club is realizing its football and commercial opportunities whilst continuing unprecedented investments in both youth development and the local community,"" City said. PSG said Friday it would accept the financial sanctions imposed by UEFA -- the same that City faces -- despite ""irreconcilable differences"" over its sponsorship with the QTA. It said the measures imposed would mean a ""tremendous handicap"" as it seeks to establish itself as one of Europe's leading clubs, having reached the Champions League quarterfinals this season. ""We will continue to invest in developing a highly competitive team and we will continue our investments in our stadium and training infrastructures while at the same time remaining, as we are today, debt free,"" PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said in a statement. Turkish clubs Galatasaray, Bursaspor and Trabzonspor were also sanctioned for exceeding spending limits, being fined €200,000 and told to meet break-even limits, as was Bulgaria's Levski Sofia. Russia's Zenit St. Petersburg, Rubin Kazan and Anzhi Makhachkala must reduce their operating deficits to break-even by 2016 and freeze wage bills, while also facing reduction in squad sizes and limits on new player registrations for European competitions. An announcement had been expected at the start of this month but was delayed by the complexity of the legal proceedings involved, UEFA secretary general Gianni Infantino said on Tuesday. The financial fair play rules are supposed to stop clubs getting into unmanageable debt, or allow wealthy benefactors to give top teams and unfair advantage. Earlier this month, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger argued that any team that broke Financial Fair Play rules should be excluded from European competition. In 2012, UEFA began withholding prize money from clubs which did not meet the financial restrictions, and at the end of that year Spanish club Malaga was banned from European competition for a season and fined €300,000 due to unpaid bills.","Manchester City and Paris St. Germain accept punishments for breaking spending rules .

"(CNN) -- In the game of bragging rights, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison now has one over his fellow billionaire Richard Branson: his private island is bigger. Ellison has bought about 98% of Lana'I, the sixth-largest island in Hawaii -- and one that's more than 1,000 times larger than the private island that Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The governor of Hawaii confirmed the sale of the 140-square mile island Wednesday, but didn't say how much it went for. ""It is my understanding that Mr. Ellison has had a long-standing interest in Lana'i. His passion for nature, particularly the ocean, is well-known specifically in the realm of America's Cup sailing,"" Democratic Gov. Neil Abercrombie said. The island includes two luxury resorts, two golf courses, two club houses and 88,000 acres of land, according to a document filed with the Public Utilities Commission. I'm a celebrity, rent my island! But Ellison may not have bought it solely for pleasure's sake. The acquisition, which also includes various commercial and residential properties and utilities, may have made him Lana'i's potential savior. The island has ""has been losing tens of millions of dollars a year in operating costs,"" CNN affiliate KHON reported Wednesday. ""We need somebody with very deep pockets that understand this upfront that can continue these type of losses--- at least for the first few years until we can find something to make the island valuable again,"" the island's state senator J. Kalani English told KHON. The Oracle CEO is No. 6 on Forbes' world billionaires list with a net worth of $36 billion. He bought the island from Castle & Cooke, whose owner, David Murdock, has a net worth of $2.5 billion, according Forbes. Murdock is also the majority stock holder in the Dole Food Company. Dole was founded in Hawaii in 1851, according to the company's website, which brags of being the ""world's largest producer and marketer"" of fruits and vegetables. Lana'i once grew 75% of the world's pineapples, according to the Honolulu Advertiser newspaper. Castle & Cooke's website boasts employing nearly half of the island's residents, which the last census placed at around 3,500 people, according to KGMB. But Senator English told the station that the population has fallen to about 1,900. At 89, Murdock says he will retain a solar farm and a home on the island, as he retires as Lana'i's benefactor of sorts - passing the baton to the Oracle billionaire. ""Lana'i has been my passion for years and I have made huge investments of money, time and energy for the betterment of the island economy and its residents,"" Murdock told CNN affiliate KGMB. Residents have mixed feelings about the island changing hands, said Dorothy Lester, a pastor at Lana'i Union Church. ""There are people who have been waiting for the time when there would be a new owner of the island. There are those who are very anxious because David Murdock is the only person they remember who has been in control."" The island has another claim to fame -- and to IT money.

"(CNN) -- A charity that raised close to $27 million to help animals worldwide spent nearly all of that money on fund-raising expenses paid to a direct-mail company. In addition, CNN found that the charity, SPCA International, misrepresented one of its programs called ""Baghdad Pups"" on its tax filings and hired an officer for that program with a questionable background. In 2010, SPCA International owed $8.4 million to Quadriga Art LLC and its affiliated company, Brickmill Marketing Services, according to publicly available Internal Revenue Service 990 tax records. Quadriga Art is one of the world's largest direct-mail providers to charities and nonprofits. It is the same fund-raiser hired by two veterans charities that spent tens of millions of dollars for its services -- triggering a Senate investigation last month into whether one of the charities should retain its tax-exempt status. That charity, Washington-based Disabled Veterans National Foundation, collected nearly $56 million in donations over the past three years yet paid Quadriga Art more than $60 million in fees, according to a CNN investigation into the charity's tax records. The other veterans charity, National Veterans Foundation, raised more than $22 million in donations over the past three years to help veterans yet spent about $18.2 million to pay Quadriga Art, according to IRS 990 forms. The animal charity SPCA International is still in debt to Quadriga Art, according to a spokeswoman for the direct-mail firm, adding that's part of the charity's ""aggressive strategy"" to build a broad donor base. ""That resulted in an expected high cost in the beginning of their acquisition program,"" said the spokeswoman, who declined to be named. She called SPCA International's efforts a ""successful strategy."" Business tactics questioned . There's no question that a charity needs to spend money to raise money, according to Bob Ottenhoff, president of the charity watchdog group GuideStar. But he said that SPCA International's tax records raise ""a number of red flags."" ""No. 1, there is an enormous amount of money going into fund-raising,"" Ottenhoff said. ""It's not unusual for a nonprofit to fund-raise. In fact they need to fund-raise. But this organization has an enormous amount of fund-raising costs, certainly relative to the amount of money being spent."" Of the $14 million raised in 2010, SPCA International reports it spent less than 0.5% -- about $60,000 -- in small cash grants to animal shelters across the United States. It also said it spent about $450,000 -- about 3% of the total raised in 2010 -- to bring back animals from Iraq and Afghanistan as part of its ""Baghdad Pups"" program. On its website and its tax filings, SPCA International describes ""Baghdad Pups"" as a program that ""helps U.S. troops safely transport home the companion animals they befriend in the war zone."" Yet the charity admitted that only 26 of the nearly 500 animals transported to the United States from Iraq and Afghanistan were actually service animals. The rest were stray animals, said Stephanie Scott, the charity's communications director. And those 26 service animals were not attached to military K-9 units but belonged to Reed Inc., a private contractor that built roads in Iraq and Afghanistan. To highlight the work of the ""Baghdad Pups"" program, spokeswoman Terri Crisp appeared on CNN's sister network, HLN, last year with ""Ivy"" and ""Nugget,"" two former bomb-sniffing dogs she said were abandoned. ""As the military pulls out and there's not as great a need to have these dogs, there's a surplus,"" Crisp told HLN. ""These contractors don't know what to do with them so these are the dogs that are falling through the cracks and they need homes desperately."" She said it's ""unthinkable"" that the military contractors do not return the dogs back to their countries of origin. ""And that's why SPCA International is trying to put a spotlight on this so these dogs are not overlooked,"" Crisp said. But a spokesman for Reed, the contractor that employed the dogs, told CNN that the animals had been given secure new homes out of the war zone in Kurdistan and that Crisp had suddenly shown up ""out of the blue"" asking to take them to the United States. When asked about those comments, SPCA International spokeswoman Scott told CNN the charity had ""not heard that from Reed before"" and said the dogs had been removed from ""an uncaring environment in Iraq."" Questions raised about charity's management . It is not the first time questions have been raised about Crisp or charities with which she has been involved. Crisp once headed a California-based animal rescue charity, Noah's Wish, that reached a settlement agreement in 2007 with the state of California. The California attorney general investigated whether contributions for ""rescuing and caring for the animal victims of Hurricane Katrina"" were used for that purpose. In that settlement agreement from the summer of 2007, Crisp agreed not to ""serve as an officer, director or trustee or in any position having the duties or responsibilities of an officer, director or trustee, with any non-profit organization for a period of five (5) years from the date of the execution of this Settlement Agreement."" Yet in a filing with the North Carolina secretary of state's office last year, SPCA International named Crisp in its list of officers and directors. Crisp did not admit any wrongdoing in the California settlement, but the charity agreed to return $4 million in donations to California officials out of the $8 million raised by Noah's Wish. When asked about the settlement agreement, SPCA International's Scott said, ""We do not believe Terri Crisp is in violation of her settlement agreement in her capacity working for SPCA International."" Pierre Barnoti, who founded U.S.-based SPCA International in 2006, also has a questionable record as a charity manager. Three years after he founded SPCA International and became its president, Barnoti was fired as the Montreal SPCA's president after leaving the Canadian charity deeply in debt to Quadriga Art, according to Nicholas Gilman, Montreal SPCA's executive director. Gilman said that the Montreal SPCA still owes Quadriga Art nearly $2 million and that the American fund-raising company has a lien on the Montreal organization's headquarters building. Barnoti told CNN he is fighting his dismissal and, when asked why he was fired, he responded, ""It's not finished yet so there's no point in discussing something that still is ongoing."" He also defended Crisp, saying, ""She is there under the bullets trying to save dogs and cats and bringing them back to the American soldiers who befriended them.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The death of Caleb Moore is shining a spotlight on growing concerns over safety in extreme sports. The freestyle snowmobiler, attempting a backflip last week at the Winter X Games in Aspen, Colorado, couldn't rotate his machine enough to land the maneuver. The skis dug into the lip of the slope, bringing the 450-pound snowmobile crashing down on him. The vehicle slammed into Moore's head and chest. After initially diagnosing Moore, 25, with a concussion after Thursday's accident, doctors soon discovered bleeding around his heart. He had emergency surgery at St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction on Friday, a day after the accident. He had brain complications, and his family issued a statement saying he was in critical condition and being closely monitored. On Thursday, a week after the accident, Moore died. The combination of quirky, hair-raising events that make up the X Games were once pushed to the distant margins of televised sports. But in recent years, some have been added to both Summer and Winter Olympic slates. ""They do train all year for this,"" said Dr. Christine Trankiem, a trauma surgeon at Medstar Washington Hospital Center. ""But it's important for the folks watching at home to realize that these acts, while exciting to watch, are potentially life-threatening, limb-threatening and brain-threatening acts if an accident should occur."" Moore's injury was one of several at this year's Winter X Games. His younger brother, Colten, suffered a separated pelvis in the same event. Freestyle skier Rose Battersby, a New Zealander, incurred a spinal fracture, and Icelandic snowboarder Halldor Helgason suffered a concussion. Sebastian Landry, a filmmaker who specialized in snowmobile features, told the New York Times last year that injuries in the sport made him lose interest in filming. ""It seemed like every time we went to the mountains somebody went to the hospital,"" Landry told the Times. ""Kids get stars in their eyes and just want to go for it. That, plus being raised with the motor-head mentality where it's all or nothing."" It's not just the athletes who appear to be at risk. During one of the jumps on Sunday night, Australian Jack Strong was attempting a backflip on his machine when it got away from him. The runaway snowmobile crashed into a bank of fans. A young boy who hit his knee on a parked vehicle while trying to get away was evaluated and released; other spectators avoided injury. Strong was not seriously injured. ESPN, which organizes and televises the X Games, says it is constantly working to ensure the safety of competitors. On Thursday, the network said it was deeply saddened by his death. ""As a result of this accident we will conduct a thorough review of this discipline and adopt any appropriate changes to future X Games,"" ESPN said in a statement, adding that Moore was ""a four-time X Games medalist who fell short on his rotation on a move he has landed several times previously."" ESPN says the safety of fans is also a priority. ""We've worked closely with athletes, risk management specialists, sport organizers and event managers to ensure the safest possible conditions for athletes and spectators alike. Further measures are constantly being evaluated to ensure the safest possible experience for spectators,"" the network said in an earlier statement. One thing spectators won't experience: a drop-off of the X Games. ESPN says it is expanding the Summer X Games to Munich, Germany; Barcelona, Spain; Foz do Iguacu, Brazil; and Los Angeles. The Winter X Games were expanded this year to include Aspen and Tignes, France. ""This is something that is truly valuable for sponsors, for ESPN, in terms of generating tens of millions of dollars of revenue, in terms of subscriber fees and advertising sales,"" said Lee Berke, president and CEO of LHB Sports, Entertainment & Media Inc. Berke said that while ESPN did not win the U.S. rights to televise the Olympics, ""they've gone about making the X Games their own Olympics.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- ""Swatting"" pranks have sent police rushing with guns drawn to a growing A-list of celebrity homes in recent weeks, but new tactics, technology and a proposed law could bring the dangerous hoaxes to an end. Russell Brand's Hollywood Hills home was the latest target Monday afternoon. A 911 caller told a Los Angeles Police Department emergency dispatcher that a man with a gun was in the house. ""A number of officers from the Hollywood Division"" were sent to Brand's address, LAPD Detective Gus Villanueva said. To get to Brand's home high above Sunset Boulevard, police cruisers sped up the narrow, winding street past the homes of Halle Berry, Herbie Hancock and many other celebrities. Officers must approach the scene with guns drawn, not knowing what is happening inside the house and expecting the worst. ""It's a very high-risk response,"" Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. ""The problem with crying wolf is that sometimes it's not false, so we always have to respond accordingly but cautiously."" Among the LAPD, the Sheriff's Department and other local agencies in the Los Angeles area, it has happened about a dozen times in recent months. The actors and musicians targeted would make an impressive red carpet: Rihanna, Justin Timberlake, Miley Cyrus, Chris Brown, the Kardashians and Tom Cruise. A 12-year-old boy was sentenced to two years in juvenile detention after he admitted last month that he made fake emergency calls that sent police to Ashton Kutcher and Justin Bieber's homes last October. ""The comments of the call advised that there were individuals inside the location with guns and explosives, and that several people had been shot,"" a police statement said. Boy admits 'swatting' Kutcher, Bieber . Dozens of emergency personnel rushed to Kutcher's home on October 3, 2012, only to find workers inside and no emergency, police said. Kutcher, who was on the set of his TV sitcom ""Two and a Half Men,"" also rushed to his home. Catching swatters who spoof a telephone number so that an emergency dispatcher thinks a call originated from a celebrity's home will get easier as technology and tactics improve, Whitmore said. These prank calls earned the nickname ""swatting"" because law enforcement agencies sometimes would send SWAT teams to respond to the false emergencies. Law enforcement agencies are ""making advances each day"" in their ability to track the calls to their origin, he said. Along with new technology, investigators have analyzed the calls to learn how to identify them. ""We're getting better at knowing what is and what isn't a hoax,"" he said. When Rihanna's Hollywood Hills home was swatted last week, the dispatcher suspected it was a hoax, so just one police patrol car was initially sent, LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said. ""We figured it was a swatting,"" Smith said ""We really low-keyed it compared to how we've been."" LAPD officers are being trained on ""what to be aware of and the possibility these are swatting calls,"" Smith said. ""We're training dispatchers to be able to recognize certain distinct characteristic of these calls and maybe change the way we dispatch them so they don't draw as high a profile response."" The rash of swatting incidents spurred the sheriff and other law enforcement chiefs to push for tougher penalties for those convicted, Whitmore said. California state Sen. Ted Lieu has introduced legislation to require a mandatory 120 days in jail for anyone convicted of swatting, Whitmore said. The swatter would also have to repay police for all costs, which would probably be several thousand dollars, he said. ""This is not a panacea, but a step in the right direction,"" the sheriff's spokesman said. Lieu, whose Los Angeles district covers some of the celebrity homes targeted, held a public hearing on his proposal at the California Capitol in Sacramento on Tuesday morning.","Celebrities targeted by fake 911 calls recently would fill a Hollywood red carpet .

"(CNN) -- A new SARS-like virus recently found in humans is ""a threat to the entire world,"" according to the director-general of the United Nations' World Health Organization. The so-called novel coronavirus ""is not a problem that any single affected country can keep to itself or manage all by itself,"" Margaret Chan said Monday in her closing remarks at the 66th World Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. The world needs to pull together its resources to properly tackle the virus which, Chan said, is her ""greatest concern"" at present. ""We understand too little about this virus when viewed against the magnitude of its potential threat,"" she said, and more information is needed ""quickly"" and ""urgently."" ""We do not know where the virus hides in nature. We do not know how people are getting infected. Until we answer these questions, we are empty-handed when it comes to prevention. These are alarm bells. And we must respond,"" she said. Novel coronavirus is part of a family called coronaviruses, which cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, as well as a variety of animal diseases. However, the new virus is not SARS. The virus had infected 44 people worldwide as of last week, most of them in the Middle East, according to the World Health Organization's most recent update Thursday. Half of them have died. Also in its Thursday update, the WHO appeared to have given the novel coronavirus a name: Middle East respiratory symptom coronavirus, or MERS-CoV. A 23rd death was reported Tuesday, when a French hospital and the French government reported a man diagnosed with the coronavirus had died of organ failure. The patient, the first of two people to be diagnosed with novel coronavirus, died at University Hospital of Lille, where he had been treated since May 9. The man contracted the virus while visiting the Arabian Peninsula, said Marisol Touraine, France's minister of social affairs and health, in a statement. The second patient, also male, was in stable but very serious condition, the hospital said. One of the patients shared a room with the other and contracted the virus. Joint WHO missions with Saudi Arabia and Tunisia will take place as soon as possible, with the goal of gathering the facts needed to conduct a risk assessment, Chan said Monday. 5 things to know about dangerous, SARS-like virus . Earlier this month, the WHO said two health care workers in Saudi Arabia became ill while treating patients. Novel coronavirus acts like a cold virus and attacks the respiratory system, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. But symptoms, which include fever and a cough, are severe and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have also been seen, according to the WHO. It's not yet known how humans contract the virus, experts have said. Most of the cases so far have been seen in older men with other medical conditions; precise numbers are hard to come by, as officials don't know how many people might contract a mild form. Cases have been identified in eight countries including France and Saudi Arabia, according to the WHO. Other European countries include Germany and the United Kingdom.

"(TIME.com) -- HPV-caused throat cancer made headlines this summer when the Guardian reported that actor Michael Douglas contracted throat cancer not through tobacco and alcohol, but from human papillomavirus. Douglas later said the statement was a misunderstanding, but doctors say HPV could actually contribute to malignant growths in the throat, most likely via oral sex. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control reports that about 60% of oropharyngeal cancers â€” cancers of the throat, tonsils and the base of tongue â€” are related to HPV. Now, a study published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research reports that poor oral health, which includes dental problems and gum disease, is an independent risk factor for oral HPV infection, and by extension, could also contribute to oral cancers. The research team from the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston studied more 3,400 participants between the ages 30 to 69 who were part of the 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The volunteers provided data on their oral health as well as on their HPV-infection status. TIME.com: Yes, you can get throat cancer from oral sex . Those who reported poor oral health had a 56% higher rate of HPV infection than those whose mouths were healthy, and people who had gum disease and dental problems had a 51% higher risk of being infected with HPV than those who didn't have these issues. The connection between the virus, which is most often associated with sexually transmitted diseases, and oral cancers only emerged about five years ago, Dr. Maura Gillison, a professor at Ohio State University who studies HPV infections in the head, throat and neck, told TIME in June. Every year in the United States, more than 2,370 new cases of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancers are diagnosed in women and about 9,356 are diagnosed in men. White men have the highest rates of HPV-related throat cancer, fueling a recent rise in HPV-related oral cancers overall while tumors associated with tobacco have been declining. ""In the U.S., there is an active shift going on,"" Gillison told TIME. ""Fortunately thanks to tobacco policy and public-health awareness, the incidence rate for the classical head and neck cancer caused by smoking is declining. But unfortunately, the rate of oropharynx cancer is still going up and it's because of the HPV component."" Some of that rise can be attributed to barriers that public health campaigns faced in addressing a sexually transmitted virus. When two vaccines that protect against the most common forms of HPV became available after 2006, for example, political and social resistance to vaccinating young girls as part of the childhood vaccination schedule led to slow uptake of the inoculation. Parents and politicians worried that the shot would promote promiscuity among pre-adolescents, and were also concerned about reports that the immunizations caused serious side effects such as fainting. There were even claims that they also contributed to mental disorders. Both proved unfounded, as studies verified the safety of the vaccines and the lack of heightened sexual activity among vaccinated girls. If left untreated, HPV can cause cancers in the cervix, anus, penis, vulva, vagina, as well as in the head and neck. Some forms of the virus also contribute to genital warts, but the latest studies suggest that the HPV vaccines can lower infection rates and therefore may be important weapons in fighting not just cervical cancer but oral cancers as well. That's important since there is currently no scientifically proven way of testing for oral HPV, which makes monitoring for these virus-related cancers in the mouth more challenging and preventing them more critical. TIME.com: New cancer screening guidelines include HPV tests . Even without a shot, however, the researchers say their results hint that it may be relatively easy to control HPV in the oropharynx â€” by brushing regularly and keeping the mouth environment clean. ""The good news is, the risk factor is modifiable -- by maintaining good oral hygiene and good oral health, one can prevent HPV infection and subsequent HPV-related cancers,"" said study author Thanh Cong Bui, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in a statement. And there are other benefits to brushing as well. Good oral health may also prevent other conditions such as the gum disease gingivitis, which has been linked to heart disease. A healthy mouth, it seems can also be a sign of a healthy body. This story was originally published on TIME.com .","CDC: About 60% of oropharyngeal cancers are related to human papillomavirus .

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities set free a former teen cartel hit man on Tuesday and sent him back to the United States. The release of Edgar Jimenez Lugo, a U.S. citizen known as ""El Ponchis"" or ""The Cloak,"" comes less than three years after a Mexican court found him guilty of torturing and beheading at least four people and kidnapping three others as an operative for the South Pacific Cartel. The teenager's age -- 14 at the time -- and his on-camera description of the slayings, brought international attention to the case. Analysts said the dramatic example showed how Mexican drug gangs were increasingly recruiting youths. On Tuesday, Mexican authorities said he had served his three-year sentence and had been sent back to the United States. The teen, now 17, boarded a commercial flight from Mexico City to San Antonio, Texas, on Tuesday morning, according to Jorge Messeguer, government secretary in Mexico's Morelos state. Asked about the teen's case, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman said the agency facilitated the return of a U.S. citizen on Tuesday. She declined to provide details, citing privacy restrictions. An aunt in San Antonio signed off on the teen's repatriation there, a state official in Morelos told CNNMexico. A judge released him five days early, Messeguer said, to steer clear of too much publicity in the high-profile case. ""The judge determined she wanted to guarantee his privacy and safety,"" he said. After the teen's arrest in 2010, some children's rights advocates were critical of Mexican authorities who paraded him before television cameras and allowed him to answer reporters' questions. The teen answered the battery of questions, point-blank, as camera flashbulbs flickered. Troops standing beside him wore masks to hide their faces. But the teen's face was clearly visible. ""I slit their throats,"" he said, describing what he said was the killing of four people. With his hands shoved into the pockets of his cargo pants, the teen told reporters he was paid weekly in dollars and pesos. But in answering questions about whether he knew what he was doing when he allegedly participated in the killings, the teen said he was under the influence of drugs and unaware of his actions. The teen told reporters a cartel leader threatened him. ""I either work or he'll kill me,"" he said. On Tuesday, Mexican officials said they had been working with the teen to rehabilitate him. ""We did not wait until two weeks before his exit to work with him. We have been working with him all this time on the therapeutic aspect, and saw results. But we cannot assure that it is a complete rehabilitation, because the time to work with him was limited,"" said Ana Virinia Perez Guemes, president of a court for adolescents in Morelos. ""Really, the three years of imprisonment are not enough to achieve a complete reintegration."" Perez said the teen would continue rehabilitation in the United States. ""We think that we did the best we could with him, and the idea is that he can expect to have a better life in a different country, in his country of origin, when he gets the support that he needs, in an environment of understanding and of boundaries, and not of discrimination, where they can help him to return to a productive life,"" she told reporters, according to Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. Rosalia Martinez de Leon, another judicial official, stressed that the teen was no longer serving time. ""He is a minor who is requesting a return to his country of origin, and so ... he is owed all the due protection so that he can find the best place to continue,"" she said. 13-year-old assassin murdered in Mexico .

"(CNN) -- By now, you've likely seen the shocking video -- professional football player Ray Rice punching his future wife out cold in an Atlantic City casino elevator and dragging her limp body out. There's been so much to this saga, much of it developing very quickly every day this week. The latest is that the NFL has hired former FBI director Robert Mueller to lead an investigation into how the league handled the case involving the ex-Baltimore Ravens' running back. We have to say former because Rice was fired this week. In this important story involving arguably America's most treasured sport, who said what when? Who knew what when? And where is this all going? CNN breaks it down. Can you explain this from the beginning? This timeline is a great place to start to learn how far back this elevator incident goes -- it happened early in the morning on February 15 -- and the twists and turns continued until this past Monday when TMZ published a bombshell surveillance tape that revealed what happened inside the elevator. Until Monday, Ray Rice's punishment was a two-game suspension, a fine and an agreement to attend a rehabilitation program that some legal experts say could have cleared him of a third-degree aggravated assault charge if he met certain requirements. The TMZ tape hit and then what? On September 8, TMZ published surveillance footage that showed Ray Rice punching Janay Palmer. She is now Janay Rice. The couple married a little more than a month after the February elevator incident. When TMZ posted the tape on its website, Rice was about two weeks away from rejoining the Ravens on the field. But after TMZ's Monday reporting, the situation changed for the ball player. Rice was released from his contract. Both he and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell faced incredible criticism. Current and former players and sports world insiders demanded to know if the league had asked for the tape and questioned how Goodell handled the whole matter. See some of those angered after seeing the TMZ tape . What did the NFL commissioner say after TMZ published the video? On September 9, Goodell talked to CBS. He said that no one in the NFL had seen the tape TMZ published showing what happened inside the elevator. The NFL had only seen another video that showed the exterior of the elevator and Rice dragging Janay out of it. About that scene -- in which Rice is seen pulling his unconscious fiancÃ©e out of the elevator, face-down -- Goodell said, ""It was ambiguous about what actually happened"" inside the elevator. CBS's Norah O'Donnell asked: ""But what was ambiguous about her laying unconscious on the floor being dragged out by her feet?"" ""There was nothing ambiguous about that,"" Goodell replied. ""That was the result that we saw. We did not know what led up to that. We did not know the details of that."" See the rest of the CBS interview . Goodell said no one at the league saw the videotape of Rice hitting his wife. Why? Goodell told CBS that the NFL had requested all materials related to the case from law enforcement but did not receive anything. ""On multiple occasions, we asked for it,"" he said. ""And on multiple occasions we were told no."" On Tuesday, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that security for Atlantic City casinos is handled by New Jersey State Police. ""Any videos related to an ongoing criminal investigation are held in the custody of the state police. As we said yesterday: We requested from law enforcement any and all information about the incident, including the video from inside the elevator. That video was not made available to us,"" McCarthy said in a statement. Reaction to Goodell's handling of the Rice case was severe. Some sports observers and current and former players blasted him for giving Rice too light a punishment with the two-game suspension, and others said they doubted Goodell was being truthful that he'd not seen the tape showing what happened inside the elevator. Several questioned if he had really pushed hard enough to get it. CBS asked Goodell if he thought his job was on the line. He said no. What is this about a news report contradicting Goodell's claims? On Wednesday, the Associated Press, citing an unnamed law enforcement source, reported that the video showing the violence inside the elevator was actually given to the NFL five months ago. The law enforcement official told the AP that in early April, he sent the video to an NFL executive. The official played a 12-second voicemail recorded April 9 from an NFL office number, the AP reported, in which a female voice confirmed that the video had been received. According to the AP, she expressed thanks and said, ""You're right. It's terrible."" How is the former director of the FBI involved? On Wednesday, the NFL said that Mueller, the FBI chief from 2001 to 2013, will have access to all NFL records. According to league spokesman Greg Aiello, two NFL owners who are attorneys -- John Mara of the New York Giants and Art Rooney II of the Pittsburgh Steelers -- will oversee the investigation. ""Many of us were dissatisfied with the original two-game suspension of Ray Rice,"" Mara said in a statement Wednesday. Goodell ""took responsibility for that in his August 28th memo to the owners when he stated, 'I didn't get it right. Simply put, we have to do better. And we will.' He then took appropriate steps to address this matter."" The NFL's policy on domestic violence ""has been strengthened,"" he said, saying that the league has a ""strong partnership with anti-domestic violence groups,"" and will ""be a better league for it going forward."" Mara was referring to a change in policy that Goodell made recently that any NFL employees -- not just players -- who are determined to have committed battery, assault, domestic violence or sexual assault would be suspended without pay for six games for a first offense. Second-time offenders would be banned from the league for at least a year. ""My understanding is that the League and the Ravens made repeated requests to obtain the video of the Ray Rice incident and were denied each time,"" Mara's statement continued. ""The notion that the League should have gone around law enforcement to obtain the video is, in my opinion, misguided, as is the notion that the Commissioner's job is now in jeopardy. The video is appalling, and I believe that the team and the League took appropriate action after they finally had the opportunity to view it. ""There is no place for domestic violence in our sport or in our society,"" he said, ""and we are committed to doing our part to prevent such heinous acts going forward."" How are people reacting now? ""#FireGoodell"" and ""ResignGoodell"" are trending on Twitter Thursday. Some current and former NFL players blasted Goodell on social media. The commissioner ""should be held accountable for his lack of action just like Ray Rice has finally been held accountable for his actions,"" free agent and former New Orleans Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma tweeted Wednesday. The same night, San Diego Chargers free safety Eric Weddle tweeted: ""As a husband, father and player I'm embarrassed to be associated with the NFL right now!"" ""NFL Players Association should demand that Ray Rice be banned from the NFL. I'd be damned if I had to be associated w/ him [Rice],"" tweeted nine-year NFL veteran Coy Wire. Some feel there needs to be a broader examination of how the NFL handles allegations of domestic violence. An opinion piece Thursday by CNN legal analyst Mel Robbins brings up other cases and demands that Goodell lose his job. The National Organization for Women, a longtime advocacy organization for women's rights, dismissed Mueller's appointment as ""just window dressing,"" and was leading its web site Thursday with #ResignGoodell. In other football circles, Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti admitted he didn't handle the Rice situation properly. He said he didn't see the video from inside the elevator and made false assumptions about what happened.","The NFL says it did not see the video showing Ray Rice striking his then-fiancÃ©e .

"(CNN) -- The Band Perry has stepped in to help with expenses to bury a mother and eight children who were killed in a house fire in Greenville, Kentucky. The offer follows news that only two family members -- the father, Chad J. Watson, and an 11-year-old girl -- survived the fire Thursday morning. The country trio's representatives contacted the Watson family and offered to take care of all the expenses, Watson family friend Pam Burden said. The group also offered to pay hotel expenses for family members staying near the medical center where the two are being treated, she said. ""I don't know why The Band Perry reached out to the family other than they are just very gracious,"" Burden said. ""The family doesn't have any personal connection to the band before now."" The Band Perry's publicist, Brian Bumbery, confirmed the group's offer. Watson is listed in critical condition, and his daughter is in stable condition at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Burden said. The mother was identified as 35-year-old LaRae Watson. The eight children who died in the fire ranged in age from 4 to 15. Investigators have ruled the fire accidental, according to Kentucky State Police. ""It appears that an electric baseboard heater located in a bedroom ignited some nearby combustibles,"" it said in a statement. Greenville is a small city, with a population of just 4,300 and a median income of $39,000. As news of the group's offer spread, hundreds of people posted messages of gratitude on the band's Facebook page. ""I'm a volunteer firefighter here in Muhlenberg County and I want to thank you for your generosity and support you have given to the Watson family,"" wrote Willam Michael Vick. ""You guys are truly amazing."" The Band Perry, made up of siblings Kimberly, Neil and Reid Perry, burst onto the country music scene in 2010 with their self-titled debut album, which spawned the hit single ""If I Die Young."" The group released its sophomore album ""Pioneer"" in 2013. The band is set to perform Sunday as part of the Super Bowl XLVIII pregame show in East Rutherford, New Jersey. CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","The Band Perry will pay for burial costs for nine people killed in a house fire, publicist says .
