"(CNN) -- For decades, many African countries saw some of their most skilful young people take their talents to other parts of the world, lured by the financial prospects outside the continent. But lately, as much of Europe continues to shrink under the weight of austerity, an increasing number of Africans are turning their backs on cash-strapped western economies to return to their continent, seeking jobs and new economic opportunities. One of these returnee Africans -- known as ""repats"" -- is Nigerian Joshua Egba. The 33-year-old financial consultant left the West African country a decade ago to continue his studies in London, UK. ""Things weren't really happening in Nigeria in about 2002,"" he says. ""People were going to the UK for better opportunities."" But this picture changed completely in 2008, Egba notes, when the global financial crisis hit Britain, bringing with it a feeling of fear and job insecurity. ""Business are laying staff off, the government is laying staff off, so you're not safe,"" he remembers. ""I thought really it's time for me to go home because I'm hearing all these stories, all these success stories coming from Nigeria, coming from Africa."" Read more: The Africans looking to make it in China . For Nigeria, 2008 was a turnaround year as a series of government reforms boosted the country's economy that has continued to grow since then: in the past three years, the oil-rich West African nation has seen growth of more than seven percent while much of the western world remains mired in financial turmoil. While the evidence over the returnee figures in Africa is largely anecdotal, observers cite the continent's impressive economic growth, coupled with improvements in governance, a boom in telecommunications and the economic slowdown in the West, as the key factors for the apparent increase in the number of Africans coming back to the continent. Read more: Activists use web to fight back in anti-corruption battle . ""People who wouldn't have considered coming back in the first instance started looking at the possibility of actually going back to Africa to look for better opportunities,"" says Funto Akinkugbe, managing director of findajobinafrica.com, an online platform that facilitates the connection between recruitment agencies, employers and jobseekers. Akinkugbe notes that his site, which he says receives around 43,000 - 45,000 visitors on a monthly basis, has recorded an increase of 35-40% in the last two years over the number of people applying for jobs in Africa. He adds that this increase is supported by the ever growing number of the Africa-focused job portals, which now number in hundreds. Akinkugbe says that the main areas of employment activity are the mining industry in Central African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, agriculture in West Africa and the oil and gas sectors in countries such as Uganda and Ghana. But part of this increasing interest, Akinkugbe explains, is not only limited to Africans. ""You now also have Europeans looking at exploring opportunities in Africa because Africa is an emerging market, the next destination,"" Akinkugbe says. ""There's been a number discoveries within the last 10 years in the oil and gas sector, so you have a lot of countries ... that are willing to bring in experts so they can actually develop the local industry."" Jean-Philippe Chauzy, a spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration, says African countries with growing economies have the potential to attract skilled profs back home. ""Those who are skilled and highly-skilled are basically employable on the global jobs market, so they will tend to go where jobs are available,"" says Chauzy. ""Now, it might be in their country of origin if the country of origin has a growing economy -- for instance, think of Angola where there is growth,"" he adds. ""So those migrants, because they have skills and they've got access to information, will weigh their chances -- whether it's better to stay in Europe or whether there's more of a future going back home and creating an enterprise or a small business and basically trying to hone their skills.""

But amid this brain-gain boom, there are still millions more professionals in the African diaspora put off by the daily inconveniences of living in some parts of the continent. Problems such as traffic, power cuts, corruption and the general struggle to get things done quickly can act as a deterrent, especially among high-skilled African migrants. Nigerian Tunde Ogunrinde, who returned to his country after spending some 20 years in Europe, is today the chief operating officer of restaurant chain Chicken Republic. He says he was lucky to return to a well-established and organized industry but adds that more needs to be done to make it more appealing for professionals such as doctors, nurses and lecturers to come back to the country. ""The government really needs to put more of an enabling environment for those industries to lure back, not just people like myself in the retail, hospitality industry, but also in those industries,"" says Ogunrinde.

"(CNN) -- Charges against actress Lindsay Lohan in an alleged Manhattan nightclub fight ""are not ready to proceed at this time,"" her attorney said Monday after a hearing at New York criminal court. Lohan did not attend the hearing because there was nothing for her to plead to, said her attorney, Mark Heller. ""It's my opinion that this case will ultimately be declined for prosecution, but it will be several weeks before the district attorney makes that decision,"" Heller said. Lohan: The reality show we don't want to watch . Lohan was charged with misdemeanor assault after allegedly punching a woman early in the morning of November 29, 2012. She is accused of hitting Tiffany Mitchell, 28, of Palm Beach, Florida, at the trendy Avenue Lounge in Manhattan's Chelsea district. Heller said Lohan didn't hit anyone. Lohan heads to court again . ""All she did was verbally request her privacy,"" he said. He accused Mitchell of ""seeking her 15 minutes of fame"" and predicted Lohan would be exonerated. The case is the latest legal trouble for the 26-year-old actress, whose struggle with drugs and alcohol has seen her bounce in and out of court 19 times and to five rehabilitation facilities since 2007. Lohan is scheduled to appear at a probation violation hearing on January 15 in California. She was on probation for a 2011 conviction on charges related to the theft of a necklace, but that probation was jeopardized in November 2012 when the city attorney in Santa Monica, California, filed four charges against her in connection with a car crash last summer. In the Santa Monica case, Lohan is accused of giving false information to a police officer, obstructing or resisting a police officer in the performance of his duty, and reckless driving, according to the city attorney's office. The charges, all misdemeanors, stem from a car crash while Lohan was on her way to the set for the filming of ""Liz & Dick,"" a Lifetime movie that aired last year.

"(CNN) -- Amy Winehouse's attempt at a European concert tour ended in Belgrade, Serbia, with a train wreck of a performance Saturday night in which she staggered around the stage and stumbled through several songs. The audience eventually chased Winehouse off the stage with loud boos several numbers into what was supposed to be the opening show in a 12-date tour. A representative for Winehouse said her next two concert dates have been canceled. Winehouse representative Tracey Miller did not directly confirm that the ""Rehab"" singer, who has a history of battling drugs and alcohol, had fallen off the wagon. Winehouse only recently left a British rehab program that a representative said was intended to prepare her for the European concerts. ""Yes, Amy has cancelled appearances in Istanbul and Athens for the coming week,"" Miller told CNN Sunday. ""Despite feeling sure that she wanted to fulfill these commitments, she has agreed with management that she cannot perform to the best of her ability and will return home."" Video clips of the musical disaster, recorded by concert-goers' cell phone cameras, were quickly posted on YouTube. They showed Winehouse failing in every attempt to sing more than a few slurred lines of her songs. Audience members could be heard filling in the gaps, along with her back-up singers. ""She would like to apologize to fans expecting to see her at the shows but feels that this is the right thing to do,"" Miller said. When Winehouse entered a rehab program at London's Priory Clinic last month, a representative told CNN that ""she wants to be ready for performances in Europe this summer and decided to seek an assessment.""

"(CNN) -- The chairman of the Australian radio network at the heart of a hoax call targeting Prince William's pregnant wife has called the apparent suicide of one of the nurses duped by the prank ""truly tragic."" ""It is too early to know the full details leading to this tragic event and we are anxious to review the results of an investigation,"" Southern Cross Austereo's Max Moore-Wilton wrote Sunday in a letter to the head of King Edward VII's Hospital in London. The hospital, where a nurse apparently committed suicide after being duped by two DJs from Australian radio station 2DayFM, has condemned the radio station in a strongly worded letter. The DJs, impersonating Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, called the hospital Tuesday and gained information about the condition of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge -- which they subsequently played on air. On Friday, the nurse who transferred the call through to the ward, Jacintha Saldanha, was found dead. Opinion: Why airing the prank call was wrong . London's Metropolitan Police have contacted Australian authorities in relation to the call, but ""are not discussing about what or with who"" they're talking, a spokesman told CNN. A spokeswoman for New South Wales Police in Australia told CNN: ""As the investigation into the death of London nurse Jacintha Saldhana continues, New South Wales Police will be providing London's Metropolitan Police with whatever assistance they require."" Southern Cross said all advertising had been pulled from 2DayFM until ""at least the end of business Monday"" after several large advertisers pulled out. Ben Barboza, Saldanha's husband, expressed grief over his wife's death in a post on Facebook: ""I am devastated with the tragic loss of my beloved wife Jacintha in tragic circumstances, She will be laid to rest in Shirva, India."" Saldanha's daughter posted a photo of herself with her mother and wrote: ""I miss you, I loveeee you. Jacintha saldanha."" The chairman of the hospital where the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge was a patient slammed the Australian radio station's decision to broadcast the recorded prank call as ""truly appalling"" on Saturday, . ""King Edward VII's Hospital cares for sick people, and it was extremely foolish of your presenters even to consider trying to lie their way through to one of our patients, let alone actually make the call,"" wrote hospital chairman Lord Glenarthur. ""The immediate consequence of these premeditated and ill-considered actions was the humiliation of two dedicated and caring nurses who were simply doing their job tending to their patients."" ""The longer term consequence has been reported around the world and is, frankly, tragic beyond words."" Lord Glenarthur called on the radio station to take steps ""to ensure that such an incident could never be repeated."" The fallout from Saldanha's death has stretched from Britain to Australia -- with questions being raised about how far is too far in the effort to find out details about Catherine's pregnancy. The two Australian DJs behind the practical joke, Mel Greig and Michael Christian, have come under fire, with some using the phrase ""blood on your hands"" to condemn their actions on the Sydney-based radio station. ""Pranksters Face World Fury,"" screamed the front-page of the UK's Daily Mirror on Saturday, while Daily Telegraph columnist Bryony Gordon said it was ""not so funny to hear two grown adults call up a hospital ward full of sick people to try to scam information about one of them."" Read more: Nurse's death casts glare on 'shock jocks' The DJs have since apologized, and ""mutually decided"" to go off the air for an undetermined period, Rhys Holleran, CEO of the Southern Cross Austereo media group, said Saturday during a news conference. But he defended the legality of the station's action, saying he was ""very confident that we haven't done anything illegal."" ""This is a tragic event that could not have been reasonably foreseen, and we are deeply saddened by it,"" he said. The Australian Communications and Media Authority, the country's media regulator, has not yet commented on the case. However, it will be ""engaging with the licensee, Today FM Sydney, around the facts and issues surrounding the prank call,"" said the regulator's chairman, Chris Chapman. News of Saldanha's death broke Friday, with the hospital saying she ""was recently the victim of a hoax call."" London's Metropolitan Police said that Saldanha, 46, had living quarters in central London provided by her workplace. Police said they were notified Friday morning that a woman was found unconscious at the address. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Police are treating the death as ""unexplained."" A postmortem examination will be held next week, police said. A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron said Saturday that he ""thinks this is a very sad case and his thoughts are with her family and colleagues."" Throughout the controversy surrounding the hoax, authorities did not identify the nurse. Her identity was released after her death. Audio of the call posted online suggests a woman spoke briefly to the DJs before she put the call through early Tuesday morning to the ward where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for acute morning sickness. ""They were the world's worst accents ever. We were sure 100 people at least before us would've tried the same thing. ... We were expecting to be hung up on. We didn't even know what to say when we got through,"" Greig told listeners Thursday. Off the air, Greig and Christian tweeted about the practical joke on Thursday and earlier Friday, promising ""more on the #royalprank."" The pair's Twitter accounts were taken down late Friday. Some listeners applauded the prank, like one who identified himself as Guido on the station's Facebook page and wrote, ""It is only a joke people! it was great i love it!!!"" Others were outraged, with negative comments outnumbering positive ones on 2DayFM's Facebook page even before the nurse's death. ""Your stunt was done at a time in this country where there is paranoia about the intrusion of the media into people's lives,"" Gary Slenders wrote. ""I know you will say it is harmless fun, the management of 2DayFM will say that it won't happen again, but this is exactly where the phone hacking scandal started."" The outcry grew exponentially after the hospital confirmed Saldanha's death, leading the Coles supermarket chain to remove all its advertising from 2DayFM. ""This death is on your conscience,"" reads one Facebook post. Several accused the two of having ""blood on your hands."" Saldanha's family released a statement asking for privacy and directing questions to police. She is survived by her husband and two children. ""We as a family are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved Jacintha,"" said the statement, released by police. Saldanha worked at King Edward VII's Hospital for more than four years, and she was described as an ""excellent nurse,"" well-respected by co-workers, the hospital statement said. The hospital ""had been supporting her throughout this difficult time,"" it said. A St. James' Palace spokesman said: ""The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are deeply saddened to learn of the death. ""Their Royal Highnesses were looked after so wonderfully well at all times by everybody at King Edward VII Hospital, and their thoughts and prayers are with Jacintha Saldanha's family, friends and colleagues at this very sad time."" Separately, a palace spokesman told CNN: ""At no point did the palace complain to the hospital about the incident. On the contrary, we offered our full and heartfelt support to the nurses involved and hospital staff at all times."" The hospital said Wednesday that it deeply regretted the call had been put through.

"(CNN) -- In China, the ""little emperors"" may have no clothes, at least when it comes to economic risk-taking and being conscientious workers. That's the finding of a new study that looks at the effects of China's one-child policy on the current generation of young adults in the world's second-largest economy. China enacted strict rules mandating that families in urban areas be limited to just one child in 1979 in an effort to curb a rapidly rising population. Since then China's economy has taken off, while its population growth has slowed, and wages and living standards have soared. But China's young people may be in search of security and office jobs now and less likely to become a new generation of stockbrokers, business-starters or high risk managers. In a paper published in the latest issue of Science, a team of researchers from Australia studied a group of 421 individuals born both right before and right after the implementation of China's one-child policy. They tested them with a series of games involving trading money with each other that measured how trusting they were and how willing they were to go after ""winning"" transactions. One of the authors, Professor Lisa Cameron of Monash University, said that the groups of children born after the policy were considerably more risk-averse, less trusting and trustworthy, pessimistic and less competitive than children born before the policy. The study concluded that ""the causal impact of the One Child Policy is to reduce the probability of choosing a risky occupation (defined to include private firm managers, stockbrokers, people who are self-employed or freelancing) by 22.7 percent."" ""These were quite large differences,"" Cameron said from Melbourne, Australia. ""It was eye-opening how much more nervous and less trusting they were and implies that these behaviors could have wide-ranging economic and social implications."" The study found that 27% of the children born before 1979 were from single-child families, while 82% of the individuals born by 1983 studied were only children. The subjects were all from Beijing and were better educated than the average citizen, but the authors believe that the results should be similar in other Chinese cities and populations. And rather than getting better, the study found that as a new generation of children of only children grows up, the effects they found are likely to ""magnify"" as fewer Chinese grow up with extended families. The authors said that much of the outcome of the study could be explained by the effects of the one-child policy on family values in China. Many opinion pieces in Chinese media criticize what is seen as a selfish wave of young people who have always gotten whatever they want from doting parents, causing them to be nicknamed ""the little emperors.""","Children born under China's one-child policy less likely to take economic risk, study finds .
Only children are often criticized in media, earning the nickname ""little emperors""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Amid exotic trees in a garden setting rest Hong Kong's extraordinary and ordinary, those who died heroically in wars, ignominiously in drunken brawls, or suicide; victims of accidents, pestilence, and pirates; barkeepers, prostitutes, children, and luminaries whose names are today borne on street signs. It's a far cry from the highway overpass outside the gates. Charting the 8,500 or so names and weaving their stories together into a 624-page book, ""Forgotten Souls: A Social History of the Hong Kong Cemetery,"" is Patricia Lim, who spent about a decade on the project. The cemetery had only a record of graves -- which date from 1841 to 2007 -- identifying them by section but not with precise locations, while the earliest graves had no information, Lim said. A ""fanatical friend"" from the UK spurred her on to the cemetery project after Lim had dedicated a chapter of her last book, ""Discovering Hong Kong's Cultural Heritage: Hong Kong and Kowloon"" to the Happy Valley cemeteries. The friend was none other than Susan Farrington who has recorded graves in the Himalayan foothills of Pakistan. She came to Hong Kong to help. When she left, Lim couldn't stop. ""Since I was in it, I might as well finish,"" she explained. With inscriptions as a starting point, Lim and a host of volunteers recorded each grave into a database, assigning it a section, row and number. Then she pored through now-defunct newspapers -- like The China Mail, the Friend of China, the Daily Press -- personal and travel accounts, histories and every book on Hong Kong she could get her hands on. ""It seemed such a waste of opportunity -- and stories -- not to link them,"" Lim said. ""If you just go through the cemetery, plot-by-plot...no one would have taken any interest. It seemed imperative to link, if people were going to get to know them."" Out of it emerged a social history of, if not Hong Kong, then of the cemetery whose names have included the ""Protestant Graveyard"" and the ""Colonial Cemetery."" Adjacent to it are separate cemeteries for Catholics, Jews, Parsees, and Muslims, while Hindus were given land for their temple. The Chinese, on the other hand, ""were always at the bottom of the pile"" despite being the majority, said Lim. ""They weren't trusted, and they weren't accorded respect of other nationalities here."" Although some 225 Chinese are buried in the Hong Kong Cemetery, Chinese didn't get their own permanent cemetery -- in Aberdeen, on the south of the island -- until 1915, decades after other groups got theirs. Hong Kong was ""a hard, unhealthy place to live,"" Lim said. ""It was a gamble. You sacrificed health for wealth. But that was maybe why they were so wealth-conscious. It was very important. You knew you were sacrificing, that you'd probably die."" The cemetery opened at its current location in 1845 after its former spot -- just east of where the office tower Pacific Place 3 now stands -- overflowed beyond capacity. Hong Kong had become a British colony only three years earlier. Read about a floating cemetery concept . Particularly prominent at the time were doctors, two of whom -- Dr. William Aurelius Harland and Dr. William Morrison -- have the cemetery's biggest monuments and most appreciative epitaphs, according to Lim. They were among four colonial surgeons who died within a 12-year period of malarial fever in Hong Kong. Hong Kong wasn't really ""happy"" or a place for European women, Lim said. With a high ratio of lonely bachelors in a transient population, brothels and bars were in high demand. ""There were German taverns, English taverns, American taverns,"" including Edward Thomas' Uncle Tom's Cabin, which opened in the 1850s after its namesake novel was published, said Lim. Thomas, a New Yorker buried in Section 9, died at age 29, leaving his widow to run the business. Among the 465 graves that belong to Japanese are ship crewmen, shop owners, employees of trading firms as well as prostitutes, according to Lim. One monument to Kiya Karayuki bears the signatures of 58 girls, suggesting she was either a much-loved prostitute or a brothel keeper. Also buried at the cemetery are the first to not only make their fortunes in Hong Kong but also give to it: financier and developer Sir Catchick Paul Chater, who transformed Hong Kong and Kowloon waterfronts; Sir Kai Ho Kai, founder of the medical school that would evolve into the University of Hong Kong; and Robert Ho Tung, who built a commercial empire. Others meanwhile died without a trace except for the inscription on their tombstones, Lim said. Old graves were difficult to read, requiring multiple trips under different light conditions. ""Some I never managed to read."" she said. There were also family members who had the same names. And then there were Chinese who went by as many as three or four names during the course of a lifetime, whether it was during school, used for family purposes or attained upon wealth. In the late 19th century, the Botanical Garden staff helped the cemetery evolve from a simple graveyard to a lush cemetery garden inspired by those in Europe, like Pere Lachaise in Paris and Glasgow's Necropolis, according to one landscape architect. The experimentation with exotic plants helped enrich the cemetery's landscape, turning it into a habitat for dozens of butterfly and moth species, said Ken Nicolson, who wrote ""The Happy Valley: a History and Tour of the Hong Kong Cemetery."" For Lim's husband, Po Chye, cemeteries are for ceremonies, not for idle strolls. ""You don't go there for recreation."" Lim, who is ""over 76,"" has had some close calls -- she once tripped, cutting her knee on a metal railing with jagged points; another time she got locked in the cemetery after hours and had to climb out through a government building. She also once borrowed somebody's grave to rest while suffering what a doctor later diagnosed as ""broken heart syndrome,"" an incident similar to a minor heart attack. ""Not everyone is willing to do all this hard work and then put it out in the open for everyone to benefit from,"" wrote David Bellis, who has listed the names, graves and inscriptions compiled by Lim on his website, Gwulo, which is dedicated to historic Hong Kong. ""The database gives the basic details, but the book adds the stories that bring the people to life,"" he said. Stella Loterijman, who's based in the UK, had been trying to find her grandfather's first wife, Mary Constance Reilly, since 1979. All she knew was that Reilly was born in 1869, married Dr. Charles William Reilly and died at age 20 of dysentery, while he was on a tour of duty with the Royal Army Medical Corps in Hong Kong. Then last month, Loterijman was resuming research into her family tree when she found Mary's information on Gwulo: ""In loving memory of Mary Constance Reilly, wife of Captain Reilly"" in section 18. In an e-mail to CNN, Loterijman described being ""thrilled and elated."" Craig Bissell also credits Lim and Gwulo for helping solve a years-long mystery over Miller Robb Dickson, the favorite brother of his Scottish grandmother, who has always said he went off to Canada to join the Hong Kong Police Force and died unexpectedly. Even so, Bissell, who lives in Toronto, Canada, could never find evidence of Dickson's ever being in Hong Kong until it suddenly appeared on Gwulo one day. ""It was a marvelous breakthrough,"" Bissell wrote, adding, ""It solved a mystery no one else seemed terribly concerned about."" Dickson's listing identifies him as a police sergeant for the Hong Kong Police Force from Dundee, Scotland, and who died in 1928 at the age of 30. Nicholas Belanovsky and his wife, Tatiana, are among 108 Russians buried in the cemetery. All that was known of him for decades was that he had escaped for China after the Russian Revolution, said his grandnephew, Dmitry Belanovsky, in an e-mail from Moscow. Then in 2004, Dmitry typed ""Belanovsky"" into a browser -- and to his ""amazement"" discovered that Nicholas' name appeared as an engineer for the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of the Surety of the Sinners in Shanghai during the 1930s. With the help of a Russian priest, he found the grave and subsequently learned that Nicholas' work with the British Cigarette Company had taken the couple to Hong Kong in 1948. He lived to the ripe old age of 88 on the second floor of a Kowloon apartment building, surviving Tatiana by nearly 30 years and leaving his entire estate to his longtime amah, or maid. Having been regarded as ""stateless"" and the ""people's enemy,"" Nicholas had never gotten in touch with his family in Russia apparently fearing harm would come to them, said Dmitry. He has since posted the info on Gwulo in hopes of learning more about Nicholas Belanovsky's life. ""It's full of stories, this cemetery,"" said Lim, who now splits time between Hong Kong and England. ""They are like old friends, yes."" For now, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department operates the cemetery, which has yet to attain heritage status.","Patricia Lim charts 8,500 graves, weaves stories in 624-page book .

"(CNN) -- Five people were injured -- three seriously enough to require hospital treatment -- when an escalator at a commuter rail station in New Jersey suddenly went into high-speed reverse Monday morning, authorities said. The incident occurred at the Exchange Place station in Jersey City, and the three injured and taken to hospitals had possible back or neck injuries, according to Ron Marsico, spokesman for the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) service. Alex Rodriguez, 30, was on his way to work when he saw the malfunction on the opposite escalator and immediately took out his phone to capture a video. ""Everyone started looking around and then it starts to go down at an accelerated rate,"" Rodriguez told CNN. ""At that point, people started piling up towards the bottom and couldn't get off the escalator fast enough."" Rodriguez's video footage showed commuters struggling to climb up the fast-moving escalator. Rodriguez said the escalator finally stopped after a minute. ""You could hear people screaming, people were jumping off the sides,"" said Rodriguez. ""People lined up against the wall at the bottom (were) crying after they got off."" PATH officials are investigating whether the effects of Superstorm Sandy played a role in Monday's incident, according to a PATH statement. Neither the statement nor Marsico specified why officials think the storm's after-effects might manifest themselves in an escalator accident. ""As a precaution, PATH has suspended escalator service at Exchange Place through (Tuesday) morning,"" said Marsico. ""In addition, workers are reviewing all PATH escalators throughout the system."" While that station's escalators are out of the service, the station remains open, with customers directed to stairs and elevators. Rodriguez, the witness, said that since Sandy, the Jersey City PATH station hit by Monday's incident has had major issues. ""To see something like that happen was really icing on the cake,"" he said. The conditions of those injured, including the three taken to hospitals, could not be determined Monday afternoon.","""You could hear people screaming, people were jumping off the sides,"" says a witness .

Obama's smiling likeness beams through the glass storefront on a special-edition poster designed by photorealist Chuck Close. A-listers sign up for inaugural celebrations . Close is a well-known supporter of the Obama campaign and last September he put up for sale 10 tapestries based on different images of the president. Asking price: $100,000 apiece. This time, the Close poster is limited to 2,013 prints and retails for $100. Buttons are an Inaugural standby and they're always big sellers. ""Everyone wants a button to have a piece of the day,"" Marketing Merchandising Director Meaghan Burdick said at the store's sneak peek this week. In 2009, the top five items sold were buttons.

"(CNN) -- At the start of the 2012 Formula One season, with a driver pairing that comprised of a virtual rookie and a former world champion who had been out of the sport for two years, little was expected of Lotus. But the combination of 2007 title winner Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean, whose only previous experience in F1 was seven unspectacular races for the team in 2009, has flourished, collecting 84 points from the season's opening five races. The highlight of a promising start was a double podium finish for Lotus in Bahrain, a result which contributed to Raikkonen's current position of fourth in the early-season drivers' standings, with Grosjean eighth ahead of the next race in Monaco on May 27. The team's on-track success has been played out against a backdrop of financial upheaval, with owner Genie Capital having terminated a lucrative longterm sponsorship deal with Group Lotus -- owned by the Malaysian car manufacturer Proton. The UK-based outfit will, however, continue to race under one of the most famous names in motorsport. Fire mars Maldonado's first grand prix win . Team principal Eric Boullier insists that there are sufficient sponsorship deals to plug the monetary gap created by Group Lotus' departure. ""We have not lost our title sponsor -- not in the real sense of the word lost. We have decided to end the contract, or the agreement, we had with them at the middle of last year,"" Boullier told the official F1 website. ""We wanted to change our strategy, and actually we are, if I may say so, wealthier than we were before. We have bigger budgets this year and will keep the name Lotus under a license agreement. ""We have signed some big names as sponsors. If you look at my shirt, there are two new names on it. We have been able to sign deals with Unilever and Microsoft, which are two really big names."" Boullier said the Bahrain race was a fitting tribute to the work put in by the team -- who previously competed under the Renault name. Latest F1 standings . ""It was a fantastic reward. We haven't performed in that mode since 2006,"" he said. ""The fact is we were expecting to deliver something after the first three races, but we had to come to terms with the little glitches we had. When that was done -- voila -- it finally worked."" Boullier said there was a good relationship building between experienced former Ferrari driver Raikkonen, who is is in his 10th F1 campaign, and Frenchman Grosjean -- a 26-year-old who has yet to complete a full season. ""Obviously Kimi, with his experience, his character and personality, tends to have a certain degree of leadership. But in fact it is not leadership but probably more attention,"" Boullier said. Ferrari pile pressure on Massa . ""On the other hand Romain is digging a little place for himself nicely and is getting a lot of respect every weekend from the team. ""You must not forget that Kimi has done something in the range of 160 grands prix and Romain has just finished his 12th grand prix this weekend."" Boullier said the 32-year-old Raikkonen, who collected another podium finish at last weekend's Spanish Grand Prix, has adapted well to life at Lotus' Enstone headquarters. ""Kimi doesn't like PR, doesn't like media. So why should we bother him with it? Sure we need a balance between his demands and the requests from our sponsors,"" Boullier said. ""But he knows that we care very much about his schedule and try to minimize his obligations. That's it. He is a racer so he races for winning and hardly cares about the rest! ""Kimi is like a wild animal and you have to let him run the way he wants to go. We don't have to tell him what he has to do because he is a professional and we want him to deliver on track first.""","Lotus team principal Eric Boullier is impressed with the team's start to the season .

"(CNN) -- The body of a million-dollar lottery winner will be exhumed for additional testing after toxicology results revealed the Illinois man died of cyanide poisoning, a judge ruled Friday. Urooj Khan won the prize in June on a scratch-off ticket. The next month, he was dead. Investigators initially ruled Khan's cause of death natural. But after being prompted by a relative, the Cook County medical examiner's office revisited the case and found a lethal amount of cyanide in Khan's system. ""That ... led us to issue an amended death certificate that (established) cyanide toxicity as the cause of death, and the manner of death as homicide,"" Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Steve Cina said Monday. Authorities are hoping to use the exhumation to determine how the cyanide entered Khan's system. The exhumation is expected to occur Thursday, CNN affiliate WGN reported. No arrests have been made in the case. ""We are investigating it as a murder, and we're working closely with the medical examiner's office,"" Chicago police spokeswoman Melissa Stratton said Monday. Related: The problems with winning the lottery . Khan, 46, planned to use his winnings to pay his mortgage and bills, make a donation to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and invest more in his dry cleaning businesses. The check, which amounted after taxes to about $425,000, was issued July 19, according to CNN affiliate WGN, but Khan never got to spend it. The next night, Khan came home, ate dinner and went to bed, according to an internal police department document obtained by the Chicago Tribune. His family later heard him screaming and took him to a local hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, the paper reported, citing the document. Chicago police haven't offered details, including a possible motive, about what they call an ""ongoing investigation."" Talking briefly with CNN affiliate WBBM and the Tribune, Khan's widow described her husband as kind and exemplary. Jimmy Goreel, who runs the 7-Eleven where the winning lottery ticket was sold, offered similarly glowing comments about Khan. ""I would never think that anybody ... would hurt him,"" Goreel told WGN.

"(CNN) -- State military forces on Friday retook a key town in northern Mali after intense fighting that included help from French military forces, a defense ministry spokesman said. ""Today, we have recaptured Konna,"" said the spokesman, Diaran Kone, at a briefing played over state radio. The Mali city of Konna had been seized by Islamist forces on Thursday as they pushed southward from their strongholds in the desert of northern Mali. ""The fighting lasted for not more than two, maybe three hours; Konna was recaptured with the assistance of French, Nigerian and Senegalese troops this afternoon,"" said Kone. ""All measures were used, including the drones given by France."" Earlier, Nigeria's defense minister had denied to CNN that Nigerian troops were involved in Friday's fighting. But France confirmed that its armed forces had taken part in the fighting and launched airstrikes in support of the operation. French President Francois Hollande announced that French ground and air forces were in the country to aid government forces. ""French military forces have brought their support to the Malian forces this afternoon to fight against these terrorist elements,"" said Hollande, speaking from the Elysee Palace in Paris. ""This operation will last as long as it is necessary. I will regularly inform the French people about its course."" Read more: A ticking time bomb: What's behind the instability in Mali? It was not clear how many French troops were deployed. But French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the French military has also launched airstrikes. Mali's interim president, Dioncounda Traore, declared a state of emergency across the country Friday and called for ""a general mobilization"" to defend against the advance of radical Islamists. He acknowledged France's military help, including air support. Hollande said Mali ""is facing a terrorist aggression in the north,"" and added that ""the whole world is aware"" of the terrorists' ""brutality and extremism."" ""Today, it is therefore the very existence of this friendly state that is at stake, as is the security of its population and of our own 6,000 citizens living there,"" he said. Read more: Troops could be headed to Mali to fight Islamist extremists . France, which has posted troops in many locations in Africa, had said it wouldn't send combat troops to Mali and had pledged to scale back on intervening in local politics and conflicts in Africa. For example, it declined a request to intervene in the Central Africa Republic, where an insurgency flared. So the Mali operation underlines the seriousness of France's concern over its former colony. French hostages have been taken in neighboring Niger by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb; Paris is trying to contain any further militant expansion in the heart of Africa. Read more: International leaders push for military intervention in Mali . Northern Mali has been occupied by radical Islamists, who moved in after fighting broke out in January 2012 between government forces and Tuareg rebels. West African states and international leaders, worried about an al Qaeda foothold, say a rapid military intervention is essential to solving the security crisis in Mali. Hundreds of thousands of Malians have been uprooted because of proliferation of armed groups, drought and political instability after a coup d'etat in March. Hollande said the country is consulting with the United Nations and ""intervening within the framework of international law."" Parliament will be consulted as soon as Monday on the operation, he said. ""The terrorists must know that France will always be there whenever the rights of a country that strives for freedom and democracy are threatened, not just when its core interests are at stake,"" he said. Europe, Fabius said, ""has made some decisions to train and reshape the Malian army."" ""The terrorists' breakthrough must be stopped,"" he said. ""If not, it's the entire Mali that falls into their hands, with a threat to the whole of Africa and Europe."" The U.N. Security Council cited ""grave concern over the reported military movements and attacks by terrorist and extremist groups"" in northern Mali. ""This serious deterioration of the situation threatens even more the stability and integrity of Mali and constitutes a direct threat to international peace and security,"" the council said. Last month, the council authorized a one-year military peacekeeping mission in Mali. The African-led International Support Mission in Mali aims to help rebuild Mali's security and defense forces and to help Malian authorities recover the areas in the north. Read more: Northern Mali, 'magnet for international jihadis' A regional group, the Economic Community of West African States, has pledged thousands of troops to the mission, and the Security Council has urged other member states to contribute troops. The Malian government and rebel groups are expected to meet January 21 for peace talks in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou. Mali held its first democratic elections in 1992, after decades of military rule. It maintained a strong democracy until March, when a group of soldiers toppled the government, saying it had not provided adequate equipment for them to fight ethnic Tuareg rebels roaming the vast desert in the north. Tuareg rebels, who for decades had staged rebellions seeking independence, took advantage of the power vacuum and seized parts of the north. The rebels had fought alongside Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and returned to Mali -- with their weapons in tow -- after he was killed in October 2011. A power struggle then erupted in the north between the Tuaregs and local al Qaeda-linked radicals, who seized control of large parts of the desert north. The international community voiced concerns about al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and its expanding presence in Mali. The al Qaeda wing is linked to the attack last year in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans, U.S. officials have said. The militants in the north have applied their strict interpretation of Sharia law by banning music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also publicly stoned a couple to death in July, reportedly for having an affair. Public executions, amputations, floggings and other inhumane punishments are becoming common, the United Nations says. The militants have attacked Timbuktu's historic tombs and shrines, claiming the relics are idolatrous. The picturesque city was once an important destination for Islamic scholars because of its ancient and prominent burial sites, and it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Tuareg rebels retreated from the well-armed militants but have vowed to fight back and establish in the north their own country, which they call Azawad.

"(CNN) -- Whether you're a domestic company or an international business, failure to comply with China's strict Internet regulations risks having your online presence curtailed or shut down completely. This means being subjected to the so-called ""Great Firewall of China,"" where websites, from newspaper portals to micro-blogging services, come under intense scrutiny from government censors who prohibit topics deemed unsuitable. ""Bottom line is that there's a list of topics that domestic and international media based in China doesn't allow discussions on,"" said Doug Young, journalism professor at Fudan University in Shanghai and author of ""The Party Line: How The Media Dictates Public Opinion in Modern China."" Some of the most high-profile international Internet brands such Facebook and Twitter are blocked within China, and have been since massive protests in the country's North-Western province Xinjiang in 2009, when protesters used Facebook to organize demonstrations. Read more: Chinese journalists in rare protest against censorship . YouTube, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. It was speculated that the ban was caused by a video of Tibetans getting beaten up in connection with riots that took place in the province the year before, CNN reported at the time. Other companies, such as the search engine Yahoo!, have instead opted to co-operate with the authorities in order to stay on the local market. Yahoo! and several other tech companies came under fire in the U.S. in 2006 for providing the Chinese authorities with information about their users. Read more: Chinese newspaper in eye of censorship storm back on sale . Major international news organizations have also been at the receiving end of China's censors, frequently finding their services blocked when they report on issues seen as sensitive to the Chinese government. Both The New York Times' and Bloomberg's websites, for example, were blocked in recent months after publishing unflattering articles about the wealth accumulated by families of some senior Communist Party members. U.S. Search giant Google has also walked a rocky path in China ever since its Chinese-language interface site google.cn was launched in early 2006, with several spats over Internet censorship erupting over the years. Read more: China blocks New York Times website after story on leader's family wealth . Initially, the company agreed to censor the content in accordance with Chinese Internet regulations. However, after a sophisticated cyber-attack on Google in 2009 that allegedly originated in China, Google decided that it would no longer abide by state censorship and redirected its traffic from mainland China to its uncensored site located in Hong Kong in 2010. Despite having made a name for itself as being a company striving for greater online information access, Google was recently accused of succumbing to ""self-censorship"" after the company removed a feature highlighting blocked content in its Chinese language search engine. The accusation came from GreatFire.org, an organization that monitors Internet freedom in China, who reported that Google's feature was removed sometime between December 5 and 8. Taj Meadows, a Policy Communications Manager at Google, confirmed that the feature was disabled around that time, but wouldn't comment further. Google didn't want to comment on the self-censorship accusations. While the feature was in place, it informed users when they put in a search term that might be blocked. When a sensitive query was entered, a message would appear: ""We've observed that searching for [censored word] in mainland China may temporarily break your connection to Google. This interruption is outside Google's control."" Launched in May, the feature was introduced in response to search problems faced by users in China. Some would report receiving messages such as ""This website is not available"" or ""The connection was reset,"" before access to Google was temporarily disabled, according to Google Search's own official blog, Inside Search. The connection interruptions were ""closely correlated with searches for a particular subset of queries,"" Alan Eustace, a Google Senior Vice President, wrote on Inside Search at the time of the launch of the feature. Several hundred thousand popular search queries in China were reviewed by engineers in the U.S., who managed to identify specific problematic search terms. ""By prompting people to revise their queries, we hope to reduce these disruptions and improve our user experience from mainland China,"" he said. When the feature was introduced, Foreign Policy, a magazine on global politics and economics owned by the Washington Post Company, wrote in their online edition that ""what Google executives won't discuss -- at least publicly -- is the obvious fact that they are exposing the Chinese government's censorship tactics in an unprecedented way."" Read more: Chinese censors block news on blind activist's escape . The Chinese authorities received the warning-function with little enthusiasm, taking measures to block the feature within 24 hours of its launch, according to Greatfire.org. ""Google in turn reacted by changing the URL of this file, which again was blocked. The cat and mouse game ended... when Google geniously embedded the whole function in the HTML of its start page,"" GreatFire.org reported. The efforts from the Chinese side to block the feature caused such disruption in the search engine that it worsened the user experience, which is why the feature was finally removed, according to an Internet expert familiar with the situation. Martin Johnson, founder of GreatFire.org and FreeWeibo.org, said Google managed to embed the coding of the feature on its front page in such a way that the authorities couldn't remove it by anything less than a complete block of Google. ""The removal of the feature suggests that [Google] gave in to demands from the authorities, perhaps under threats that they would be completely blocked otherwise... There are many more things they could do, like forwarding users to the HTTPS version of their search engine, which would make it impossible for the authorities to block individual keywords,"" Johnson said, adding that recent events has lowered the expectations of Google's ability to push the boundaries in China. Doug Young at Fudan University, however, points out that Google is a company committed to free information search, and believes that it's more likely that the feature would have been deleted due to technical difficulties. ""They [the government] don't want to block Google entirely, but they still do what they can to make the user experience as horrible as possible,"" Young said. Internet users in China are aware of that their searches are being filtered and censored in different ways, he added, ""we're only hurting ourselves by adding extra technology that the government can use to slow down the search engine.""","Companies based in China must comply with strict internet regulations, or be blocked online .

"(Budget Travel) -- It began by accident. My girlfriend, Ronni, and her twin sister, Marina, rented a documentary on panda bears. We all melted. Then we went online and found videos of tourists, somewhere in China, embracing pandas. One showed a gaggle of cubs eagerly descending a slide in what looked like panda day care. ""We have to find this place,"" Ronni said, eyes lighting up. Hugging baby pandas costs about $130 and the pandas are even cuter in person than you would imagine . A friend of a friend had recently gone to China on a botanical excursion, and I could see the wheels turning in Ronni's and Marina's heads. Soon enough, we had tickets and immunization appointments. Much in the same way you might say, ""Hey, let's go to a movie,"" we made plans to cross the Pacific. We had no basis to believe that meeting pandas was possible for ordinary people. We consulted guidebooks and online travel forums, and our best bet appeared to be a facility for research and visitors at the Wolong Nature Reserve, about five hours away from Chengdu in Sichuan province. Because it was difficult to reach, we figured it must be more rewarding. Once in Hong Kong, I contracted a fixer on the mainland to help sort everything out. His name was Huang, and he'd been to Wolong earlier that year with National Geographic. Ever since Empress Wu Zetian sent a pair of panda bears to the Japanese emperor around A.D. 700, China's public face has been represented by the furry goodwill ambassadors, who even forced a smile from Richard Nixon. Today, we noticed upon arrival in Shanghai, you don't see dour Mao nearly as much as Jingjing, the flower-crowned cartoon panda that's one of the Beijing 2008 Olympic mascots, and just the first in the parade of pandas that adorn China's storefronts, advertising, clothing, and vibrant cell-phone-charm industry. In Chengdu, we were greeted at the airport by a 40-foot column topped with a giant bronze panda. On our way into the city, we also couldn't help but notice that the lampposts, rickshaws, and even highway overpasses were festooned or stenciled or otherwise decorated with pandas. But Chengdu was just a transit point for our trek along the Min and Pitiao Rivers to the Wolong Nature Reserve. We hired a driver, part of a fairly dodgy tour we'd found last-minute on the Internet. All road travel in China happens frenetically--the constant, aggressive brinksmanship of millions of shoddy minivans with toy-like wheels. We left for Wolong at dusk, ascending steep gorges that sometimes disappeared into the mist, on roads that sometimes disappeared altogether. There's no real town, and not many restaurants, other than the shabby ones at the Wolong Hotel and the Panda Inn. The following day, we awoke to a crisp and cool autumn day, with the sound of the river filling the narrow valley. This is the panda's native habitat, a subalpine arboreal wonderland that makes you understand Chinese fairy tales. The China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda has marked off large enclosures for its several dozen pandas. Last summer, the notoriously fickle pandas produced 18 cubs. We could see some of them through the glass of the nursery. The newest born were tiny pink nubs. Those slightly older were fed with bottles. The cubs we had seen online were from the previous summer. A little over a year old, all 16 played together in a single enclosure next to the nursery. Three Japanese girls entered the day-care center and frolicked among the cubs. ""How can we do that?"" I asked Tang, one of the keepers. He took us to an office, where we discovered advance work to arrange a special panda visit is unnecessary. To hug baby pandas, all you have to do is show up and pay the Wolong Panda Club $130 per person. That's nothing for five minutes of nirvana. In the flesh, the cubs were so unbelievably cute that they seemed artificial. With their round heads, big eyes, and rolling gait, they looked and acted like Jim Henson creations. Touching one felt like meeting a unicorn. The cubs moved like puppies in a curious, playful swarm. They didn't lick so much as nuzzle. And grab: To our delight, the desire for hugging was mutual, and what began as a careful encounter quickly devolved into fuzzy mayhem as the cubs attached themselves to our arms and legs. At one point, Ronni was dragged to the ground by a clutch of cubs, and she beamed beatifically. ""I can't believe this is happening,"" she said as she freed herself, only to be taken down again. After the staff pulled the cubs off us, we stood around in a daze. Stepping back outside of the panda pen, Ronni stopped grinning long enough to say, ""I want to do that again.""

"(CNN) -- A defense lawyer in a rape case that has roiled the town of Steubenville, Ohio, officially asked the court Friday for a change of venue. Attorney Walter Madison, who represents accused 16-year-old Ma'lik Richmond -- one of two defendants in the case -- filed three motions in Juvenile Court. In addition to relocating the trial, two other motions ask the court to postpone the February 13 trial, and to close the trial to the public. A hearing is set for January 25, when defense lawyers and prosecutors are expected to argue the motions before Judge Tom Lipps, Madison added. Madison said no other motions were filed Friday. The lawyer for co-defendant Trent Mays, 16, could not be reached for comment. ""We are reviewing the motions and we will respond in kind,"" Dan Tierney, spokesman for Ohio's Attorney General Mike DeWine told CNN. Defense battles social media blizzard in Ohio rape case . On Sunday, Mays' lawyer, Adam Nemann, also said he planned to file at least two motions including a change of venue ""given its publicity and what we perceive as threats to individuals, perhaps witnesses, and also defendants and even defense counsel."" Media attention and an explosion of online postings about the case are part of the reason, according to Nemann. ""We're concerned about safety issues at this point,"" he added. On Sunday, Tierney would not discuss whether there are any alleged threats. Opinion: Teach young men to treat women with respect . ""The investigation is ongoing and it includes all aspects of the case including evidence put out in social media, Tierney told CNN. Mays and Richmond are each charged with raping a 16-year-old girl during late-night partying and drinking last August, according to prosecutors. CNN is not identifying the girl, who is a juvenile, in accordance with its policy not to release the names of alleged rape victims. ""She was unresponsive, not in a position of consent, and they knew about it, and let's be clear, they knew she was drunk,"" special prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter told a judge at probable cause hearing last October. A judge from Cincinnati is hearing the case after a local judge recused himself to avoid an appearance of conflict of interest. Police Chief William McCafferty says many people in the small eastern Ohio town know someone who may have a connection to the case. Online outrage prompts city website . Often trials are granted a change of venue because of fear of a tainted jury pool. This trial is a bench trial, meaning the judge will determine the teens' fate. But defense attorney Nemann said he has another reason to ask for the change. He plans to tell the judge his case may be hamstrung by hesitant witnesses. ""I'm concerned about whether or not the case should be tried in this area. Perhaps the fact that it is in the Steubenville area is going to prohibit certain people from wanting to come forward and testify,"" Nemann said. Some potential witnesses who attended the parties where the alleged sexual assaults occurred are refusing to talk with his defense team, the lawyer said. He would not say how many witnesses. The motions will be filed under seal, Nemann said. Lawyers for both defendants have said their clients are not guilty of the charges. ""We deny the accusations completely. We deny the lack of consent. We deny that there was sexual activity. We deny that there was a rape. And we steadfastly maintain that,"" Nemann told CNN.","Two 16-year-olds are charged in the alleged rape of a 16-year-old girl .

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lanka's president on Tuesday appealed to Saudi Arabia's king to grant clemency to a housemaid convicted of killing her employer's baby. President Mahinda Rajapaksa sent the appeal to King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, said Rajapaksa's media unit. The move followed media reports that the Riyadh Supreme Court had endorsed the death sentence imposed on Rizana Nafeek for killing the 4-month-old boy in 2005. She killed the child after she was asked to bottle-feed him, Saudi police said. Nafeek said the child died accidentally, choking on milk. A three-judge panel of the Dawadami High Court found Nafeek guilty, and the death sentence was imposed in June 2007. About 1.5 million Sri Lankans work abroad -- nearly 400,000 of them in Saudi Arabia alone -- because of their limited earning potential at home. Nafeek was 17 when she started working in Saudi Arabia, and was accused of killing the baby two weeks into her job.

"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- This week's burst of catastrophic bushfires in Australia continues a run of extreme weather events that, aside from the toll in human suffering, is pushing up the cost of doing business in the Australian agricultural sector. Australia is one of the world's most efficient food producers, particularly of grain, meat, dairy, fruit, vegetables and wine. It vies with other exporters such as Brazil, Argentina, Canada and New Zealand for a large slice of the $1 trillion a year global market for imported food. And in a world where contaminated soil, acid rain, poisonous water, disease and pestilence blights much of the food production capacity in the big consuming nations of China and India, Australia's reputation for a clean and relatively unstressed growing environment has given it a marketing edge. But over the last decade its primary producers have had to run a gauntlet of climatic extremes that is testing both their resolve and their resources. With 20% of Australia classified as desert, farmers have always had to be conscious of how, when and where to use their soil, water, fertilizer and other agricultural inputs. The new problem for Australian farmers is the business cost of volatility, exemplified by the intensity, duration and extent of these catastrophic weather events. Droughts are longer, fires are fiercer, hailstorms are more damaging and floods cover greater parts of a country that is 50% larger than Europe and is exceeded in size only by Russia, Canada, China, the United States and Brazil. Photos: Catastrophic fires threaten Australia . Years of drought in the 2000s culminated in the deadly ""Black Saturday"" bushfires in Victoria state in February 2009 that claimed 173 lives, wiping out whole towns and hundreds of farms in the process. Those fires were followed by devastating floods across Queensland and New South Wales in 2010-11 that took another 33 lives and affected 2.5 million people, with insurance payouts of $2.5 billion, according to the Insurance Council of Australia, and a total financial impact estimated by the Queensland Reconstruction Authority at more than $5 billion. Now Australia's focus is on bushfires again, and the impact it might have on export-oriented food production. While sheep and cattle losses have already been extensive, there are other farming sectors at risk, too, such as wine. Australian wine exports are worth about $2 billion a year, according to Wine Australia, with new consumers in China and other parts of Asia driving a trend to lighter, sweeter red and white wines. In the Hunter Valley 150 km (93 miles) north of Sydney, mid-January is harvest time in what has long been recognized as one of Australia's premium wine growing areas. Every year, the valley's winemakers await the long, hot, dry days of the southern hemisphere summer that increases the sugar content and intensifies the flavor of the grapes. With the right combination of daytime heat and a smattering of light rain at night to cool the soil, they stand a chance of creating a standout vintage. The 2013 vintage had been shaping as just such a year, until a lingering continental-scale ""heat cell"" over inland Australia sent temperatures soaring and sparked this week's bushfires in four southern states. Vines that thrive at 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) are stressed and shriveled when the mercury climbs to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and beyond. For the Hunter Valley's winemakers, timing is everything. In the next few days they must decide whether to send in the first waves of grape pickers, or hold off a bit longer in the hope of creating even greater flavors. If they do delay, they run the risk of losing the crop to heat stress, or worse, losing their precious vines to a bushfire. After several days of 40-plus temperatures this week and a forecast for temperatures in the Hunter Valley to reach 42 degrees Celsius (107.6 degrees Fahrenheit) again on Saturday, plus the possibility of thunderstorms, the winemakers face some tough decisions. Australia, of course, is not alone in facing a more unpredictable weather regime. Weather forecasters and climatologists around the world point to events that seem to suggest that even if the planet is not getting hotter, it is getting more volatile. Superstorm Sandy in the United States, drought in Africa's Sahel, a bitter cold snap in Europe and floods in China were just some of the severe weather events of 2012. Longer-term, what the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) calls ""slow-onset"" climate change is seen as likely to have a heavy impact on food production in developing nations. According to the FAO, climate change could have potentially disastrous consequences for food security in the period 2050-2100. The FAO estimates that a billion people around the world now lack food security. To meet projected food demand by 2050, when the world's population will have grown from 7 billion now to about 9 billion, it says global agricultural production will need to grow 60% above the level of 2007. That will test the resourcefulness of farmers not just in Australia but in other great ""food bowls"" across the world, from Brazil to China, India and the United States.","Extreme weather pushing up cost of doing business in the Australian agricultural sector .

"(CNN) -- An employee of German Bundesliga club Hoffenheim has admitted to using a device which emits a high-pitched sound to stop Borussia Dortmund fans singing offensive songs during their match at the Rhein-Neckar Arena on Saturday. The purpose of the noise, according to the employee, was to stop Dortmund's traveling supporters from chanting insults at Hoffenheim's owner Dietmar Hopp. The club, which gained promotion to Germany's top division in 2008, distanced themselves from the employee's actions and denied any knowledge that the device was being used. ""An employee of Hoffenheim admitted to using a corresponding [sound] device, on Saturday during the match against Borussia Dortmund,"" read a statement on Hoffenheim's official web site. ""According to this employee, he had longed for a 'remedy' to the insults directed at [club owner] Dietmar Hopp -- which, he felt, had become intolerable."" The statement went on to outline that the employee had meant the action to be ""light-hearted"" and the club apologized to fans of the German champions Dortmund who had been affected. ""The employee has also admitted that he was not aware of the impact his actions would have and intended them to be of a light-hearted nature. ""Hoffenheim has reacted with corresponding disciplinary action against the employee."" An investigation launched by Hoffenheim also discovered the device was set up on four occasions last season, in matches against Mainz, Cologne, Frankfurt and once again Dortmund, but not used. The match finished 1-0 to Hoffenheim, with Sejad Salihovic's goal proving the difference between the two teams. Hopp is one of the founders of German software corporation SAP AG and is the Hoffenheim's chief financial backer. The 71-year-old has overseen Hoffenheim's promotion from the eighth tier of German football to the Bundesliga and also funded the construction of the club's 30,000-seater Rhein-Neckar Arena -- which opened in January 2009.","A Hoffenheim employee has admitted to using a high-pitched sound on Dortmund fans .

"(CNN) -- It was 1984. Hulk Hogan had won the WWE Championship from The Iron Sheik, Rowdy Roddy Piper smashed a coconut over Jimmy Snuka's head and Captain Lou Albano's appearance in Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" was hitting the airwaves. Fans around the world couldn't wait get their hands on toy company LJN's first line of WWE action figures. Sure, these tiny wrestlers were made of hard plastic and had zero moveable joints, but these were WWE action figures. Children wanted to play with the heroes and villains they saw on TV each week. ""I can remember asking my mom and dad for LJN figures straight off the shelves when I was about 8 or so,"" said Daniel Epps, a 34-year old, decades-long fan of WWE figures from Gloversville, New York. Fast forward 27 years and Mattel's collection of WWE figures is light years away from LJN's stiff Hulk Hogan figures. Today, Mattel's Randy Orton figure has 27 points of articulation, highly detailed tattoos and real fabric clothing that makes it the spitting image of the 6-foot-4, 245-pound superstar. The improvements are irresistible for fans. ""Now I collect as a hobby. I tried to quit buying last year when Mattel took over the WWE license, but the figures are so incredible I just couldn't stop,"" Epps said. Another WWE figurine collector, Artur Queiroga, 20, agrees. ""Mattel's WWE action figures possesses superior articulation and bear a greater likeness to the superstars than the figures of past lines. ""The different classes of action figures are executed excellently, with different accessories and ranges of articulation, making a figure of the more expensive class truly seem worth it."" Hasbro took over production of the WWE figures in 1990, adding moving arms and spring loaded movements. In 1996, Jakks Pacific added 15 points of articulation, moving legs, heads and a level of detail not seen up until this time. Mattel is the fourth company to produce WWE figures starting in January 2010. Mattel's signature take on the figures is to scale them in the most life-like fashion to-date. All previous figures by the other companies were the same standard size. It didn't matter if you were 5'9"" or 7'6""; your action figure was the same height as all the others. Now, WWE Superstar Kane, who is 7 feet tall in real life, has his action figure stand at 7.5 inches while someone like Rey Mysterio, who is 5'6,"" has his action figure stand a little over 6 inches. ""It is the coolest thing having your own action figure,"" said former World Heavyweight Champion Christian Cage. ""It is hard to describe to go into a store and see yourself there on the shelf. It is kind of a surreal thing. You kind of know you have arrived when you get an action figure."" The process of turning a WWE Superstar or Diva into an amazingly real looking figure begins with putting the real superstars under a laser. ""A four-head body scanner sits on four posts that is lowered from the ceiling,"" said Derek Handy, a senior designer from Mattel. ""A laser beam bounces back and forth off the Superstar that then creates a 3-D image. The head scanner rotates around the Superstar's head 360 degrees and picks up the depth."" Nabil Carrillo, a 19-year old from Orlando, Florida, who collects WWE, Star Wars, Marvel Universe and other action figures, believes that the WWE figures by Mattel can't be compared with any other figure when it comes to detail. ""The details on these figures are superb, and they look realistic,"" Carrillo said. ""That's what makes them popular."" These figures are played with by kids, kept in their boxes by the adults and often set up in elaborate scenes by both. To the WWE fan, the wrestlers that they see on TV each week are their superheroes. ""Right now I have loose LJNs and Hasbros displayed on the ledges above my doors and windows of our living room and bedroom,"" Epps said. ""I also have some signed figures hanging up on our dining room wall."" Fans enjoy creating dream matchups that they never thought were possible such as Ravishing Rick Rude from the 1980s and '90s vs. current WWE SmackDown wrestler Randy Orton. For the football fan, this is like seeing the 2008 Pittsburgh Steelers taking on the 1995 Dallas Cowboys. Online communities at wrestlingfigs.com, ringsidecollectibles.com and wrestlingsuperstore.com are the places where fans can discuss new and older figures. These websites also sell exclusive WWE figures that aren't available in traditional stores such as Walmart and Target. International buyers turn to these websites to find the figures that they can't find in stores in their own countries. ""We support each other in our hobby, from congratulating on recent purchases, to posting what series is out on store shelves, to advising about making custom figures,"" Epps said. Many collectors hope their investments in these figures will one day pay them back and then some. Several LJN figures on eBay are selling from $500 to $1,000. And while the current Mattel figures are not selling for that much more than their purchase price, they are expected to follow the upward price trend of the LJN and Hasbro figures. Movie and comic treasures go for big bucks . One of today's most popular activities in the WWE figurine collector community is creating customized action figures. For instance, WWE's newest acquisition from Mexico, Sin Cara, doesn't have an action figure out yet. Sellers on eBay take the time to design and hand-paint Sin Cara figures that are one-of-a-kind collector items. Even though Queiroga is a collector of all these figures, as far as selling his figures goes, he has no plans for that anytime soon. ""I've collected action figures for a very long time and they mean a lot to me. I couldn't part with them,"" he said. Epps used to buy every figure made, but now since he has a family, his spending habits have changed. ""My main goal is to have one figure of every wrestler,"" he said. ""Now I average about one figure every other week. I plan to some day give the collection to one of my kids, whichever shows the most interest in wrestling.""","With a growing base of collectors, WWE figures have vastly improved .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of people in Louisiana have been evacuated as widespread flooding threatens lives and homes. Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency Thursday afternoon after thunderstorms drenched the state with as much as a foot of rain this week. Eunice, a town in southwest Louisiana, has had 12.25 inches of rain since Tuesday, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service said. Jonathan Brazzell said seven parishes -- Acadia, Avoyelles, Concordia, East Carroll, Evangeline, Livingston and St. Landry -- have had widespread flooding since the storms began. There were no initial reports of injuries. ""The Mermentau River is well above flood stage and expected to go to major flood stage,"" he said. St. Landry Parish spokeswoman Megan Vizena said 30% of the area was underwater. Authorities in Franklin, near the Gulf of Mexico, evacuated 118 people after 7 inches of rain washed over some roads and bridges, the weather service said on its website. In Acadia Parish, rescuers saved close to 80 people from rising water, including 20 at an oil well. ""We will have more evacuations tonight,"" Maxine Trahan, a spokeswoman with the Acadia Parish Sheriff's Office said. ""There were so many roads that were closed there were not enough signs (to warn residents). An iReporter near St. Francisville, north of Baton Rouge, shot video of the rushing water of a creek under a bridge. ""I've personally never seen Bayou Sara this high, in this spot, in this short of a time span due to rain,"" said Bonnie Marquette, who is a film location scout.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of angry demonstrators gathered in Paris Saturday to demand answers over the deaths of three Kurdish women activists found shot dead Thursday in mysterious circumstances. French police union spokesman Christophe Crepin said tensions were high at the protest, which some 15,000 people attended. Officers are expected to arrest a number of people for throwing objects at police, he said. Security was also stepped up at the Turkish Embassy in Paris. The French investigation into the slayings of the three Kurdish women -- named by Turkish officials as Sakine Cansiz, Fidan Dogan and Leyla Soylemez -- is ongoing. Read more: How Paris killings could renew Kurdish flashpoint . Cansiz, the oldest of the three women murdered in the Paris offices of the Information Center for Kurdistan, was famous for being a co-founder of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. Turkey, the United States and the European Union label the PKK a terrorist organization. There is still no clear evidence as to what lies behind the apparent assassinations. Read more: 3 Kurdish women political activists shot dead in Paris . But many in Turkey fear that the triple murder could derail delicate peace talks between the Turkish government and the PKK, which launched a guerrilla war against the Turkish state nearly 30 years ago. Kurdish activists have pointed the finger at possible Turkish involvement, while political leaders in Turkey have nodded to a possible feud within the PKK. Report: Turkey's Kurdish conflict has turned more violent . Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on the French authorities Saturday to find the killers, the semiofficial Anatolian news agency reported. He also questioned why French President Francois Hollande had said the women were involved in talks with French officials. ""How can France hold talks with these people who are members of PKK that was also declared terrorist organization by the EU?"" Erdogan is quoted as saying. Turkey had contacted French authorities in November about the presence of Cansiz, he said. The activist was previously detained in Germany in 2007 but Turkey's extradition request was not met, he added. An autopsy Friday found that two of the women were killed by three gunshot wounds to the head and the third by four shots to the head, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor's office told CNN. Erdogan had previously suggested the deaths ""could be an internal settling of scores, or it could be an initiative that was taken to create an obstacle in the way of the new honest steps we are taking,"" according to the Anatolian news agency. But the PKK rejected suggestions that the killings were part of an internal feud. Read more: Turkish town on Syrian border deals with fighting, ethnic differences . In a statement published by the Firat News Agency, a pro-PKK web portal, the PKK's Executive Committee blamed the murders on ""international powers and the Turkish gladio."" ""Gladio"" refers to alleged shadowy paramilitary groups accused of carrying out acts of political violence on behalf of the Turkish state. ""It is not possible for this bloody attack to be carried out in a central place like this without the support of international intelligence services and states,"" the PKK added. The Turkish government issued a security warning to Turkish diplomatic missions in France and throughout Europe. Read more: Turkey police crack down on Kurds . Several hundred mostly Kurdish demonstrators gathered for a rain-soaked but peaceful protest in front of the French Consulate in Istanbul on Friday. A Kurdish lawmaker told CNN that the bodies of all three Kurdish activists were expected to be sent from France to Turkey for funerals. ""This could be a bullet that is shot in the head of the peace talks,"" said Sebahat Tuncel, a parliament member from the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party, speaking to CNN after Friday's peaceful protest. But, she added, ""we should not suspend a possible peace process."" Read more: Kurdistan officials hope Iraq will allow Turkish minister in . Kurdish activists accuse the Turkish government of decades of discriminatory policies against the country's largest ethnic group. Turkish security forces have arrested thousands of Kurds in recent years on suspicion of terrorist activities. Last fall, the Turkish government initiated a new attempt at dialogue with Ocalan. The PKK leader is serving a life sentence in a prison on the Turkish island of Imrali. ""We knew achieving peace would be difficult, we knew there would be provocations ... we did not expect them to happen in France,"" said Tuncel, the Kurdish lawmaker.

"(CNN) -- Robinho fired AC Milan to a shock 1-0 victory over league leaders Juventus to end the Turin club's 25-match unbeaten streak away from home in Serie A. Juventus had not tasted defeat on the road in the domestic league since May 1 2011 but was unable to find a way to see off an inspired Milan. While Juventus, fresh from its 3-0 thrashing of European champion Chelsea, has enjoyed a stellar start to the campaign, Milan has looked lacklustre. Club owner and former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi visited the players last week to discuss the team's failings. And those words of wisdom appeared to have the desired effect as the home side produced the kind of performance which had been so sorely missing in previous weeks. The breakthrough came just after the half-hour mark when Mauricio Isla handled the ball inside the penalty area and Robinho fired home from the spot. Mexes wonder goal lifts Milan into knockout stages . Juve piled forward after the break and Mirko Vucinic went close to grabbing an equalizer, but Milan held out to move up to ninth and ease the pressure on boss Massimiliano Allegri. Elsewhere, Fiorentina moved into second following a 2-2 draw at Torino. Alessio Cerci put the home side ahead five minutes before the break only for Gonzalo Rodriguez to level from the penalty spot. Valter Birsa's 76th minute strike looked to have won it for Torino, but Mounir El Hamdaoui struck five minutes from time to snatch a point for the Viola. Sampdoria moved further away from the drop zone courtesy of an Andrea Poli effort as it won 1-0 at struggling Bologna. Genoa ended its run of six consecutive league defeats with a 1-0 win at Atalanta thanks to Andrea Bertolacci's goal. Roma grabbed a 1-0 win at Pescara with Mattia Perin's fifth minute goal condemning Cristiano Bergodi to defeat in his first game in charge. Chievo's Mamadou Samassa was sent off as his side drew 0-0 with Siena. Marvellous Messi . In Spain, Lionel Messi scored twice to take his tally to 82 for the year as Barcelona cruised to a 4-0 win at Levante. Tito Vilanova's side set a new league record after scoring four goals away from home for the fourth game in a row. Messi is now just four goals away from surpassing Gerd Muller's record of 85, which came during his time playing for Bayern Munich and Germany in 1972. Magic Messi moves in on record . All the goals came after the break following wonderful play from midfielder Andres Iniesta, who ripped the heart out of Levante. The diminutive playmaker scored one himself and laid on both of Messi's goals before setting up Cesc Fabregas to seal the win. Barca keeper Victor Valdes saved a late penalty as the visitors kept a clean sheet. It means Barca has now equaled Real Madrid's 1991-1992 La Liga record of taking 37 points from its first 13 matches. Falcao on fire . Atletico Madrid remains just three points behind Barca following its crushing 4-0 victory over nine-man Sevilla. Goals from Radamel Falcao, Arda Turan, Koke and Miranda sealed the win for Atletico and takes it eight points clear of local rivals Real Madrid going into next Saturday's derby game. Sevilla, who lost Federico Fazio after just 22 minutes, was three goals down at the break as Atletico recorded its seventh consecutive home win. The visiting side was reduced to nine men on 83 minutes after Ivan Rakitic picked up a second yellow card and Miranda rubbed salt in Sevilla's wounds by firing home a late fourth. Elsewhere, Athletic Bilbao and Deportivo La Coruna shared the points in a 1-1 draw in the San Mames stadium. Oscar de Marcos put the home side ahead on 24 minutes only for Abel Aguilar hit an equalizer early in the second-half . Getafe claimed a 2-0 victory at Espanyol to keep the Barcelona side bottom of the table, two points behind Deportivo. Pedro Leon put Getafe ahead on 15 minutes before Mane doubled the lead in the final minute. Marseille on the march . In France, Marseille moved level with arch-rivals Paris Saint-Germain at the top of Ligue 1 following a 1-0 home win over 10-man Lille. Florent Balmont was sent off in first-half stoppage time with Jordan Ayew scoring a minute after the interval to seal the victory. Elie Baup's side are on 26 points but trail PSG on goal difference. Lyon missed the chance to go top after suffering a 3-0 defeat against Toulouse. Wissam Ben Yedder scored twice with Etienne Capoue sealing the win after the interval. Lyon remains one point off the lead, while Toulouse moves up to seventh. Defending champions Montpellier claimed a 1-0 victory over Bordeaux to take its unbeaten league run to five games. The win, courtesy of a Remy Cabella strike, takes Montpellier up to 12th on 17 points. Freiburg on fire . In the German Bundesliga, Freiburg moved up to sixth with a crushing 3-0 win over VfB Stuttgart. Freiburg faces Bayern Munich in its next game but will be full of confidence thanks to goals from Jan Rosenthal, Pavel Krmas and Max Kruse .

"(CNN) -- It's the dream of millions of basketball fans around the world -- to be an NBA star. But for Rudy Fernandez, who leapt to fame with his ""hellacious"" dunk in an Olympic final against the U.S. Dream Team, playing in ""the best league in the world"" was not enough. Just 27 years old and reaching his peak as a player, he has bucked convention by leaving the NBA and returning to his native Spain. ""Here probably I'm a better player, I can do everything -- not like my years in the NBA,"" Fernandez told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""The NBA, it's a business for sure, so when you sign a contract you have to know you might get traded to another team, another city. And you start playing 82 games in one season, it's a lot of basketball."" Fernandez moved to the U.S. after the 2008 Olympic final in Beijing, where Spain lost to the Americans, and spent three years with the Portland Trail Blazers. ""They gave me the opportunity to play in the best league in the world,"" he said. However, his later move to Denver Nuggets was not a success -- partly due to a back injury, and partly due to a league lockout that shortened the 2011-12 season to 31 matches. In the middle of the NBA pay dispute, he signed an interim deal with Real Madrid -- a division of one of the world's biggest soccer clubs -- and enjoyed his time back home so much that he later took up the option of a three-year deal worth a reported â‚¬8.1 million ($10.5 million). ""I came here to be the leader and win trophies,"" he announced on his arrival. Fernandez has proved as good as his word, averaging nearly 17 points per game for Real in the current Euroleague season and winning rave reviews for his performances. Real also top the domestic ACB league in Spain. Wind the clock back just over four years and Fernandez had arrived in the United States to considerable fanfare after a standout performance for his beloved Spain in China. Playing against the might of the U.S. -- this time dubbed the ""Redeem Team"" following the disappointment of Athens 2004 -- he scored 22 points in 18 minutes of court time. But it was his audacious dunk over Dwight Howard which was a talking point of the final, eventually won 118-107 by the United States. Despite the close attentions of the 2.11-meter Howard, Fernandez -- a small forward who stands 1.98m -- brushed him aside before slamming home the two-pointer. The effort was described as ""hellacious"" by one U.S. sports writer, who had clearly run out of superlatives, while Fernandez singles it out as a career highlight. He played football as a youngster on his home island of Mallorca, but basketball ability was in the family genes with both his parents players, while his elder sister Marta plied her trade in the American WNBA before also returning to Spain with her current club Salamanca. Spotted by Barcelona-based Joventut, Fernandez was set on the course to be a professional player from his mid-teens and was included in the Olympic squad for the Athens Olympics in 2004 while only 19 years of age. He went to Portland as the 24th pick in the draft. ""All the community from Portland helped me a lot with the the transition. The first year was difficult, but basketball is basketball,"" he added. Averaging 10.4 points and with a formidable conversion rate for three-point efforts and from the free throw line, Fernandez repaid Portland's faith in his abilities during his first season. His amazing air skills were also noted and he was picked to take part in the four-man NBA Slam Dunk Series at the 2009 All-Star Game. Fernandez was controversially eliminated at the first round stage but had made a lasting impression, wearing a No.10 Trail Blazer shirt in tribute to former Portland star Fernando Martin, the first Spaniard to play in the NBA. Martin was killed in car accident in 1989, but had led the way for the likes of Pau Gasol and Fernandez at the highest level of basketball. He was one of Fernandez's heroes growing up, along with Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. Gasol, five years his senior, was also an inspiration. ""Pau is probably one of the best players in the world, so he's my reference, and I work every year to be better and better,"" said Fernandez. With Portland unable to make it past the first round of the playoffs in his time there, Fernandez went to Denver in a three-way trade. He needed surgery on his troublesome back problem but recovered in time to play at the London 2012 Olympics. With Spain fielding the likes of the Gasol brothers, Pau and Marc, Juan Carlos Navarro and himself, they once again came close to upsetting the all powerful U.S. squad. Gasol netted 24 points and Navarro 21, but the U.S. edged a thrilling gold medal match 107-100, underlining Spain's rise as a basketball power. ""We are probably the second team in the world. I remember a long time ago in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, no team could compete against the U.S. Dream Team, but now there's a little bit of respect paid by them to the other teams,"" Fernandez said. He is not the only member of that team to return to Spain from the NBA. Navarro left Memphis in 2008 after just one season, and has since been an outstanding player for Real's archrivals Barcelona. ""Right now I think Navarro dominates the Eurobasket,"" said Fernandez. ""He decided to come back to Spain like me and he is probably one of the best shooting guards in the world as he demonstrated in the Olympics and in the world championships."" Navarro and Pau Gasol would both be 36 at the time of the 2016 Olympics, so their participation is questionable, but Fernandez is hoping to go to his fourth Games. While Spain dominates football, being the reigning world and European champions, its basketball team is not far behind. With Fernandez on the roster, it has won the last two editions of the European championship and claimed the FIBA World Cup in 2006. ""I'm ready for Rio. I think we have a good team, a young team with Ricky Rubio, Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka and myself."" There is still the possibility that Fernandez, a passionate music fan who has dreams of becoming a DJ, will have another go at cracking the NBA -- if his body can withstand the strain. ""Who knows in two years, three years, I could back to the NBA if I start to feel better about my back.""","Rudy Fernandez has won two Olympic basketball silver medals with Spain .

"(CNN) -- The 2020 European Championships will be staged in cities across the continent, rather than just in one host nation, UEFA's executive committee decided on Thursday. Dubbing the tournament ""A Euro for Europe"", European football's governing body has ensured the competition will firmly break with tradition as it celebrates what will be its sixtieth year. Since their inception in 1960, the European Championships have been regularly staged by just one country -- with three tournaments having been co-hosted (2000, 2008 and 2012). ""Let me say that it is a decision only about 2020,"" UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino told his organization's website. ""2020 is the 60th anniversary of the European Football Championship."" ""It is premature to go into more details. What is clear is that it will not be in one or two countries, but in several cities in Europe. How many cities is still to be decided."" In June, UEFA president Michel Platini was quoted as saying the tournament could be staged in 12-13 cities. On Thursday, Infantino added that the bidding process for host cities will start early next year and is expected to take around 12 months, with a decision expected in 2014. All but one of UEFA's 53 member nations supported the idea, with Turkey -- which had initially bid to host the 2020 finals alongside Azerbaijan and Georgia -- the lone dissenting voice. The Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales have already expressed interest in staging matches, with the latter FA stating that it ""fully supports UEFA's decision and continues to explore avenues by which to bring the UEFA tournament to Wales"" on its website. The UEFA general secretary also explained that there was a strong possibility that not all the host countries would qualify for the tournament, saying this was something that would be ""thought about and looked at"". The idea of spreading the tournament across the continent was first mooted after this year's European Championships by Platini, who suggested it as a way of avoiding high costs at a time of financial uncertainty in many countries. Fiscal concerns became of greater importance after UEFA chose to expand the tournament from 16 to 24 teams, the number that France will host when the country stages the next finals in 2016. ""Obviously the fact that the (championships) will feature 24 teams instead of 16 puts an additional burden on countries to host such an event,"" said Infantino. ""It becomes much more difficult for many countries -- the requirements are becoming bigger and bigger. ""An opportunity like this, to give many cities and many countries the possibility to host even just one part of a EURO, is certainly an excellent thing, especially in times when you have an economic situation where you cannot expect countries to invest in facilities in the way that such an event requires. ""Certainly one of the purposes of this decision is to help countries, who are perhaps not sure today whether they should build a national stadium -- giving them the impetus to build such a stadium. ""Instead of having a party in one country, we will have a party all over Europe in the summer of 2020."" Reigning champions Spain will have the chance to defend their title at the 2016 European Championships, when France will stage the finals for the third time -- using 10 host cities in the process.","2020 European Championships to be played across continent .

"(CNN) -- An elderly couple survived a bear attack in rural British Columbia, and authorities are hunting for the animal. The attack, near the southeastern city of Kimberley, apparently happened Sunday while a husband and wife were out on an afternoon walk, Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesperson Sgt. Laurie Jalbert said. The woman was walking in front when she encountered a brown bear and cubs who were near a dead deer. The bear turned on the woman, Jalbert said, and her husband tried to help her. The bear then turned on him and began attacking him, then turned back to her. Somehow the couple managed to fight the animal off, and it left, Jalbert said. The husband is in his 80s. The wife is in her 60s. Both were rushed to Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary and remain in stable condition. Both have head wounds and bites on their arms and legs. Jalbert said authorities believe the bear was a grizzly, but the husband said he thought it might be a black bear. If a bear is determined to have attacked someone, often it is put down, Jalbert said. During this time of year in that area, bears are starting to hibernate. Because this bear has cubs, it may be out of its den longer to gather food, Jalbert said.","Couple out for walk survives bear attack near Kimberley, British Columbia .

"(CNN) -- New York City officials are preparing to transport more than 150,000 students after a school bus drivers union announced that it is planning to strike this Wednesday if an agreement can't be reached. Union officials representing Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1181, who are seeking job security, announced Monday afternoon that they plan to strike on Wednesday if they can't reach a suitable agreement with the city. Mayor Michael Bloomberg bid out contracts for nearly 1,100 bus routes currently handled by Local 1181 drivers. Last year, the city bid out contracts for preschool bus routes, and the new contracts will save taxpayers $95 million over five years. Bloomberg on Monday urged the union to avoid going on strike and added that a strike would ""jeopardize the education and safety of more than 150,000 students who take school buses every single day, in a year when our students have already missed a week or more of school because of Hurricane Sandy.""","School bus drivers union will strike Wednesday if it doesn't reach deal with New York City .

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN)  -- Vice President Dick Cheney defended the Bush administration's record on prisoner interrogations, telling a veterans' group that its use of ""alternative""  techniques against suspects was legal and proper. Vice President Dick Cheney, in June with President Bush, says torture at Abu Ghraib was ""the misdeeds of a few."" ""No nation in the world takes human rights more seriously than the United States,"" Cheney said at the American Legion's annual convention. ""The policies of our country comply with our law, which prohibits torture. We're proud of our country and what it stands for. We expect all who serve America to conduct themselves with honor, and we enforce the rules."" President Bush acknowledged in 2006 that top operatives of the al Qaeda terrorist movement had been held in CIA custody and subjected to what he called ""alternative"" interrogation techniques. One was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the admitted mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington that killed nearly 3,000 people. Cheney said the CIA program involved ""tough customers and  tough interrogations,"" but said the information obtained from prisoners prevented attacks and saved American lives. Although Americans were ""rightly outraged"" by the 2004 revelations of Iraqis being abused and tortured by U.S. troops at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison, he said, people who broke the law in that case were punished. ""The misdeeds of a few should never be used to slander the good and decent Americans who go to work every day to keep our country safe,"" Cheney said. The White House has consistently denied that the United States practices torture, but CIA officials have admitted to using at least one technique -- ""waterboarding"" -- that has been considered a war crime in the past. Top Bush administration officials, including Cheney lawyer David Addington, were involved in drafting the legal justification for those techniques, a former aide to Secretary of State Colin Powell told a congressional committee in June. Critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union, decry waterboarding as torture and have demanded a stop to it. Some in Congress also have criticized waterboarding as a violation of the Geneva Conventions that could imperil U.S. soldiers should they ever be captured.","Cheney: U.S. policies ""comply with our law, which prohibits torture""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A lawsuit filed in California against Kellogg, Brown and Root on Wednesday alleges the company and its subcontractor were involved in a human trafficking plan that forced Nepali men to work against their will in Iraq. The lawyer and relatives of men who were employed by KBR and allegedly sent to Iraq without their consent. The men, between the ages of 18 and 27, were recruited in Nepal and told they would be doing work in hotel and restaurant kitchens in Amman, Jordan, but were sent instead to Iraq to work at a U.S. air base, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges KBR, based in Houston, Texas, and Daoud & Partners, a Jordan-based subcontractor, engineered the trafficking scheme. A KBR spokeswoman would not comment directly on the allegations but released a statement defending the company. ""KBR has not yet seen the lawsuit so it is premature for us to comment at this time. The safety and security of all employees and those the company serves remains KBR's top priority. The company in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behavior,"" KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne said in a statement e-mailed to CNN. ""Each employee is expected to adhere to the company's Code of Business Conduct and complete ethics training, which includes TIPS (Trafficking in Persons) information,"" Browne continued. Efforts by CNN to reach Daoud were unsuccessful. When the Nepali men arrived in Jordan, according to the lawsuit, the contractors took their passports and drove them into Iraq. Mathew Handley, a lawyer with Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, which filed the lawsuit, said about 70 Nepali men were driven into Iraq in a large convoy of civilian vehicles. One of the lead vehicles was ahead of the convoy and was stopped by insurgents posing as Iraqi Police. Twelve of the Nepali men were taken by the insurgents and later killed. ""As the men were being transported to Iraq, a car containing twelve of the men was stopped by members of the Ansar al-Sunna Army, an insurgent group. The 12 men in the car were taken hostage and executed by the insurgents,"" according to a statement on the law firm's Web site. A 13th man, Buddi Prasad Gurung, was not kidnapped and arrived at the U.S. Al Asad air base in western Iraq in August 2004. Gurung worked in a warehouse managed by KBR and was released 15 months later by the company, according to the law firm. Gurung and the families of the 12 men who were killed have brought the lawsuit. Handley says the other Nepali workers who were sent to Iraq with Gurung did not come forward for the lawsuit after they were eventually released from KBR. ""Their families went deep into debt to arrange the jobs, which they hoped would lift them out of poverty,"" according to the lawsuit. The case garnered the attention of the Department of Defense Inspector General's office after a number of news reports about KBR involvement in trafficking. The department concluded an investigation in April 2006. ""The primary finding concluded that the U.S. Government had no jurisdiction over the persons, offenses, or circumstances that resulted in the Nepalese deaths,"" according to the final report. The report also concluded that the events happened ""before starting their employment with KBR."" However, the case led to increased awareness and enforcement of trafficking laws by the U.S. military.","Suit claims that Nepali men were told they would work in kitchens in Jordan .

"(CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai is meeting this week with President Obama in Washington amid increasing ambivalence in the United States about what to do about the war in Afghanistan. Americans are tired of the war. Too much blood and treasure has been spent. The White House is grappling with troop numbers for 2013 and with the nature and scope of any U.S. mission after 2014. With the persisting corruption and poor governance of the Afghan government and Karzai's fear that the United States is preparing to abandon him, the relationship between Kabul and Washington has steadily deteriorated. As the United States radically reduces its mission in Afghanistan, it will leave behind a stalled and perilous security situation and a likely severe economic downturn. Many Afghans expect a collapse into civil war, and few see their political system as legitimate. Karzai and Obama face thorny issues such as the stalled negotiations with the Taliban. Recently, Kabul has persuaded Pakistan to release some Taliban prisoners to jump-start the negotiations, relegating the United States to the back seat. Much to the displeasure of the International Security Assistance Force, the Afghan government also plans to release several hundred Taliban-linked prisoners, although any real momentum in the negotiations is yet to take place. U.S. may remove all triips from Afghanistan after 2014 . Washington needs to be careful that negotiations are structured in a way that enhances Afghanistan's stability and is not merely a fig leaf for U.S. and NATO troop departure. Countering terrorism will be an important U.S. interest after 2014. The Taliban may have soured on al Qaeda, but fully breaking with the terror group is not in the Taliban's best interest. If negotiations give the insurgents de facto control of parts of the country, the Taliban will at best play it both ways: with the jihadists and with the United States. Negotiations of a status-of-forces agreement after 2014 will also be on the table between Karzai and Obama. Immunity of U.S. soldiers from Afghan prosecution and control over detainees previously have been major sticking points, and any Afghan release of Taliban-linked prisoners will complicate that discussion. Karzai has seemed determined to secure commitments from Washington to deliver military enablers until Afghan support forces have built up. The Afghan National Security Forces have improved but cannot function without international enablers -- in areas such as air support, medevac, intelligence and logistical assets and maintenance -- for several years to come. But Washington has signaled that it is contemplating very small troop levels after 2014, as low as 3,000. CNN reports that withdrawing all troops might even be considered. Everyone is hedging their bets in light of the transition uncertainties and the real possibility of a major security meltdown after 2014. Afghan army commanders are leaking intelligence and weapons to insurgents; Afghan families are sending one son to join the army, one to the Taliban and one to the local warlord's militia. With Afghan president's visit, nations' post-2014 future takes shape . Patronage networks pervade the Afghan forces, and a crucial question is whether they can avoid splintering along ethnic and patronage lines after 2014. If security forces do fall apart, the chances of Taliban control of large portions of the country and a civil war are much greater. Obama can use the summit to announce concrete measures -- such as providing enablers -- to demonstrate U.S. commitment to heading off a security meltdown. The United States and international security forces also need to strongly focus on countering the rifts within the Afghan army. Assisting the Afghan army after 2014 is important. But even with better security, it is doubtful that Afghanistan can be stable without improvements in its government. Afghanistan's political system is preoccupied with the 2014 elections. Corruption, serious crime, land theft and other usurpation of resources, nepotism, a lack of rule of law and exclusionary patronage networks afflict governance. Afghans crave accountability and justice and resent the current mafia-like rule. Whether the 2014 elections will usher in better leaders or trigger violent conflict is another huge question mark. Emphasizing good governance, not sacrificing it to short-term military expediencies by embracing thuggish government officials, is as important as leaving Afghanistan in a measured and unrushed way -- one that doesn't jeopardize the fledgling institutional and security capacity that the country has managed to build up. U.S. likely to keep thousands of troops in Afghanistan after NATO forces leave . Karzai has been deaf and blind to the reality that reducing corruption, improving governance and allowing for a more pluralistic political system are essential for Afghanistan's stability. His visit provides an opportunity to deliver the message again -- and strongly. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Vanda Felbab-Brown.","Afghan President Karzai meeting with President Obama in Washington this week .

"(CNN) -- Last August, a 10-year-old boy from Missouri wrote an iReport to CNN. Braydon Nichols asked that the world not forget his father, an Army officer who died when the helicopter he and other soldiers were in was downed in Afghanistan. The grade-schooler's iReport sparked a massive outpouring of love, encouragement and empathy. Thousands of people posted comments to the boy. Nearly 230 iReports were dedicated to him. No one would forget Army Chief Warrant Officer Bryan Nichols, everyone pledged. And over the past six months, CNN's audience has not forgotten Braydon. There has been no let-up in comments online asking how the boy is doing and wishing him well. This week, ""Dennis"" wrote that he keeps on his computer a picture that CNN published of Braydon and his father wearing matching military uniforms. ""Take care buddy, be strong ..."" In February, ""Kenny"" wrote, ""For some reason you popped in mind tonight. I hope you are doing well, hope the school year is going good. Take care little bud."" (Read more of the original iReport) Those notes mean a lot to Braydon, his uncle Monte Nichols said. ""We've had people from across the world reach out to us. It's been incredible for the whole family to know that people do care,"" Nichols told CNN this week. ""Braydon is doing really well in school. I think he's making his way as best as any kid could considering the circumstances."" Braydon is excited about his summer vacation plans. A generous person in Hershey, Pennsylvania, is paying for the boy and his mother Jessica Nichols to fly to the city, tour a chocolate factory and have a fun weekend. Still, Braydon has good and bad days. This month is going to be tough for the family because Bryan Nichols was due home from deployment in March. Last year, weeks before that horrible August morning that she had to tell her son that his father was gone, Jessica Nichols recalled how Braydon loved to fantasize giddily about how he and his dad were going camping when he finished fighting bad guys. The self-assured and computer savvy boy was a miniature Bryan Nichols. Their short, spiky blonde hair was styled the same. They both loved to quiz each other with random trivia. The kid adored his dad. ""Bryan is with us all the time, every day his memory is alive for us. It's hard,"" Monte Nichols said. ""But it's just as hard for all the families and the kids who lost their parents on that helicopter. Those children, just like Braydon, need to be taken care of."" It turns out, they are. After CNN's story appeared, and donations poured in to a college trust fund for Braydon, another group of soldiers and retired military members went to work to try to figure out what they could do. There were 32 children who lost a parent in the Chinook tragedy, and two of the wives of the men on board were pregnant, said retired Air Force Maj. Steve McLeary, the executive director of the Special Operations Warrior Foundation. The Tampa, Florida-based organization has been providing scholarships and assistance to kids and families of special operations personnel since 1980. Read more about the Foundation and what it provides . Most of those on the Chinook were special operations. But five families who lost loved ones on the helicopter were Army and not in Special Operations, McLeary said. ""We saw the CNN story and within 15 minutes we were on a call with board members who all agreed that every child who lost a parent on that helicopter would have their college expenses covered by us, whether their parents were special operations or not,"" McLeary said. (Tributes to the Chinook crash victims) The foundation first sent all five of the Army families money -- about $10,000 each -- to cover expenses of traveling to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to attend funerals, and to cover other expenses related to the tragedy. The foundation, which is funded by individual and corporate donations, worked with other charities to help pay for hotels for relatives who wanted to attend memorials. The Special Operations Warrior Foundation is covering all college tuition and room and board expenses for those children, too, McLeary said. ""We don't just give money, we develop relationships with these kids from the start,"" McLeary said. ""We want to make sure they know that this is something their parent would have wanted for them."" The organization's trained counselors work with each child in its program, checking in with them shortly after a death to offer professional counseling and anything else the family needs. The foundation stays in touch with children by sending birthday and holiday cards. The Special Operations Warrior Foundation reaches out to kids throughout middle school, calling them, asking how they're doing and if they need anything. A foundation representative takes a more active role when the kid reaches high school by helping them prepare and pick a college. The Special Operations Warrior Foundation has over 900 kids in their program, McLeary said. More than 203 have graduated from college, and the organization is paying for 123 kids currently in college. Knowing all that is a comfort to the Nichols family. If Braydon's first wish was that people never forget his dad, Monte Nichols said, his second is that no one forgets kids like him.","Boy posted iReport to fallen Army father last summer .

"(CNN) -- Nothing gets people in the Halloween spirit like group costumes. Teamwork was the finishing touch of many iReporters' outfits -- whether it was a team of green Army men or crayons. Many iReporters devoted a lot of time and effort into perfecting their costumes, such as Jason Chuon and his partner Jeremy Kidd, who went to creative lengths to create their nun-chuck couples costume: ""We did some searching online and came across a website that sold chain links in every size and color one could imagine."" They chose a hollow chain, cut it, tied each end of the chain to thin, plastic hair bands and finished it off with metallic-looking headbands. They chose to do a couples costume after Kidd proposed to Chuon on a business trip in Hong Kong a few weeks before Halloween last year. CNN iReport received an array of costume submissions -- iReporters slipped on masks and assumed the roles of superheroes, dressed in their best (or worst) as celebrities, and put the pop in pop culture icons with their creative and eye-catching outfits. The costume themes varied as widely as the amount of time invested in creating them -- one iReporter says she spent up to a month creating most of the 17 costumes for a ""Wizard of Oz"" group, while others chose simpler themes and created their costumes in one night, such as a Care Bears college student group displayed in the gallery above. However different the costumes were, two themes emerged among all of the iReports: the fun of the creation process as a group and the reactions at the end result. Kera Dacy and her movie accountant co-workers dressed up as the Village People and purportedly elicited quite a reaction from a celebrity on the set: ""At the end of the week we pay our employees and actors their per diem. Jessica Alba was on this list, among others. You can imagine her response to a biker with fake chest hair and an Indian handling her money.""

"TIJUANA, Mexico (CNN) -- More Americans, tired of skyrocketing gas prices, are crossing the border to Mexico, where fueling up costs a great deal less. But the AAA Auto Club warns the short-term savings could spiral into long-term expenses. Right now a gallon of gas costs about $3.10 in Tijuana, while it's about $4.60 just north of the border in the United States. That's a $30 savings on a 20-gallon fill-up. It makes financial sense to commuter Ricardo Fernandez, who lives a few miles away in San Isidro, California. He makes the international run once a week during off hours and doesn't mind waiting in line -- both coming and going. ""Right now the traffic is not bad to go back,"" Fernandez said. ""It takes me about an hour, hour and a half."" While it sounds like a big hassle, Fernandez said he just makes a shopping day out of it. ""I can come shopping ... get some groceries and stuff like that,"" he said. ""It's like saving double.""  Watch Americans buying gas in Mexico » . The story is a similar one for Pedro Hernandez who lives in Santa Ana, California, about 100 miles to the north. He doesn't make a special trip just to gas up, but he won't pass up a deal either. ""We can come down to visit relatives and shop around,"" he said. ""While we're here, might as well fill up the gas."" Hernandez saved about $40 on his tank. But the savings might come at a cost: Mexican gas is made with a different formula -- containing more sulfur -- which could hurt your car in the long run, according to Stephen Mazor with AAA's Automotive Research Center. That fuel mixture can ruin the emission control equipment on American cars and cause them to fail emissions tests. ""Then (you) have to spend a lot of money to repair your car because of the effects of that gas,"" he said. Fernandez said his truck is running fine on the Mexican gas, for now, which is all he can afford to worry about until U.S. gas prices go down.","A gallon of gas costs about $3.10 in Tijuana; it costs $4.60 north of the border .

"(CNN) -- Raphael Larrinaga was tired of sending out job applications and not getting a response, so he decided to try a different approach. No, he didn't embellish a job title or fabricate a master's degree on his rÃ©sumÃ©. Instead, he swapped out his Spanish first name for something with more ""Americanized,"" something that people would expect from a guy with blond hair and blue eyes job-hunting in Utah in the 1980s. Almost instantly, Ray Larrinaga began getting calls back, he said. Within two weeks, he accepted a job with a bank and went back to the name his Spanish-born parents had given him. ""People said I was paranoid, but I'm not exaggerating a bit,"" said Larrinaga, now a self-employed graphic designer. ""I went from almost a zero response to my applications to over 50 percent response."" In hindsight, the resident of Bountiful, Utah, said he's a little ashamed of his ploy. Sure, he could be a chameleon and scuttle his Spanish roots if he wanted to, but visible minorities can't get rid of their accent or change the color of their skin, he said. ""That was a real eye opener for me, as I realized how tough it was for minorities in my mostly 'white' community to get an even break,"" said Larrinaga, who shared his story on iReport. ""I think things have changed quite a bit for the better, but I can't help but wonder how many people still judge someone they've never met simply by what kind of name they have."" Our names say a lot about us even before the first encounter, as Larrinaga and others can attest. Just ask Jessica Simpson, whose decision to name her daughter Maxwell Drew Johnson sparked criticism that she was condemning the child to a life of torture for having a traditionally male name. In America: What does your name say about you? CNN iReporters shared the good and the bad of living with a name that flouts convention. As children, they endured playground taunts and teases. By the time they reach adulthood, they've heard it all and spent countless hours patiently (or sometimes not so patiently) explaining their names to strangers. They're used to second takes from bank tellers and waiters, mail addressed to Mr. when it should be a Mrs., and vice-versa. ""It's hard for me to figure out why a parent does this,"" iReporter Michael Howell said. ""Are they looking for attention? Because the only attention the child's going to get is going to be negative attention. I'm curious as to why mothers do this."" Howell never got a satisfactory answer from her mother as to why she gave her a boy's name. Howell said she could write a book about the lifetime of confusion and insults she has experienced because of her name, the hours spent convincing people that Michael is indeed her real name. No, she was not dodging the Vietnam War draft in the 1960s. No, she's never had a sex change. Yes, that really is her name, she tells clients who call the real estate office where she works. Really. Her children suffered a great deal for it, too, she said. They can laugh now at the cruel jokes, but at the time, it was devastating for them. Looking back, it made her a bit of a shut-in, she said. She avoided going out or engaging neighbors for fear of having to explain herself. But by the time she reached 55, she was over it, she said, and she hopes the world is kinder to Maxwell Drew. Otherwise, the best advice she can offer is to stick it out and stick close to people who are nice. ""I've made it this far. What am I going to do, change my name? What would people who've known me all my life call me?"" said Howell, now 67. ""I came in with it, I'm going out with it."" One benefit is that people rarely forget her name, she said, a common sentiment from those whose names defy societal norms. It might have been the worst thing ever as a child, but many say they have persevered and developed a thicker skin because of it. Some have even managed to embrace their traitorous names as a badge of honor that has shaped who they are. ""It has helped me understand and appreciate that we are who we are and not what we are called or named,"" said Kim Manlove, who shared his story on iReport. The 60-year-old ""decidedly heterosexual"" male has experienced a fair share of taunts over the years. As a child, his last name was the bigger problem with ""you must love men"" being a common, if unimaginative refrain. As an adult, his first name tripped up people who assumed it must be short for Kimber or Kimball. And, he still can't get those callers looking for breast cancer research volunteers to take his name off the list, he said. ""Despite a lifetime of teasing, snide comments and the occasional unwelcome advance, having the name Kim Manlove has helped instill in me a certain amount of humility and compassion. Compassion for others who through no fault or choice of their own may bear some disability or mark, seen or unseen, that draws the unwanted attention of others whose ignorance or prejudice leads them to make some hurtful or stigmatizing remark or gesture."" A snide remark from a customer service rep once caught iReporter Ryan Babarsky off guard at the pet store. Being accustomed to the drill, she obliged when he asked to see her credit card to look up her rewards number. But she didn't have a response to his question, ""Did your parents want you to be a boy?"" ""I'm not going to stand in the store and yell at somebody because they're narrow-minded,"" the 26-year-old business analyst said. ""I share stories on my blog and tell my fiancÃ©, just to have someone to confide in."" Otherwise, she feels her name suits her. As a child she was a bit of a tomboy and people seemed to give her a pass because she had a boy's name, she said. As an adult, she enjoys standing out without really having to try, and wouldn't dream of changing her name. ""I've learned a lot about people and expectations,"" she said. ""You'd think in 2012 that people would be open about gender and names ... but apparently people still have special ideas about what names mean and who they belong to.""","iReporters share stories of living with names associated with different race, gender .

"(CNN) -- Four more arrests have been made in connection over the death of a Dutch volunteer soccer official who was allegedly beaten by teenage players at an amateur game earlier this month. Dutch police said Tuesday they had arrested two 16-year-olds, a 17-year-old and a 50-year-old man. The latter is the father of a player of the Amsterdam junior side Nieuw Sloten that played in the match against SC Buitenboys, for whom 41-year-old Richard Nieuwenhuizen had volunteered to act as linesman for the December 2 game. There are now a total of eight people in custody following the arrest of four teenagers last week, and Dutch police have asked for anyone with photos or video recordings of the attack to come forward. If convicted of charges of manslaughter and assault, the two 15-year-olds in detention would serve a maximum sentence of one year in a youth prison -- while the 16-year-olds could be jailed for up to two years, unless judges rule that they should be treated as adults. Nieuwenhuizen's son was playing for Buitenboys when the incident occurred in the city of Almere. The linesman reportedly fell into a coma after he was beaten, and he died the next day. Last weekend, 33,000 amateur football games across the Netherlands were canceled in tribute to Nieuwenhuizen, who was buried on Monday. Nieuwenhuizen's death has resonated across the globe, with FIFA president Sepp Blatter among those extending condolences. ""Football is a mirror of society, and sadly the same ills that afflict society -- in this case violence -- also manifest themselves in our game,"" the head of world soccer said in a statement on FIFA's website. ""Nevertheless, I remain convinced that football -- through the example set by the tireless efforts of people like Mr. Nieuwenhuizen -- is a force for good, and we must continue to use its positive example to educate people against these wrongs."" Despite a relatively small population of 17.5 million, Holland has built an outstanding reputation for developing young footballers over the years, with its amateur youth clubs providing a strong breeding ground for the country's professional clubs.","Eight people now in custody over the death of Dutch volunteer soccer official .

Ted Stevens was charged Tuesday with making false statements on financial disclosure forms. And in the last few years, the Alaska Republican has been a poster boy for congressional spending critics. In 2005, legislation backed by Stevens to build a so-called ""bridge to nowhere"" became a lightning rod for those critics. The proposal called for construction of a $223 million bridge to connect Alaska's Gravina Island -- population 50 -- to the mainland. The allocation was backed by Stevens and Alaska Rep. Don Young, then the powerful GOP chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Congress later rescinded the earmarked funding for the bridge. The project also drew the ire of Sen. John McCain, now the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, who has long chastised Congress for wasteful spending. He has cited the ""bridge to nowhere"" in several campaign speeches this year. During the primaries, McCain said politicians' pet projects could have played a role in the Minnesota bridge collapse in early 2007. ""Maybe if we had done it right, maybe some of that money would have gone to inspect those bridges and other bridges around the country,"" McCain said in Ankeny, Iowa, on August 4, 2007. ""Maybe the 200,000 people who cross that bridge every day would have been safer than spending ... your tax dollars on a bridge in Alaska to an island with 50 people on it."" While the Arizona senator has long fought earmarks, he never specifically went after the ""bridge to nowhere,"" and he was absent for key votes on its funding, according to FactCheck.org. Stevens, 84, is the oldest Republican senator and second in age only to Sen. Robert Byrd, the 90-year-old Democrat from West Virginia. Stevens is up for re-election in 2008. The former chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee has represented Alaska in Washington since 1968 and is renowned for his prowess in steering federal funds to his vast, sparsely populated state. Stevens is the Senate's president pro tempore emeritus; co-chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee; vice chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; and ranking member of the Disaster Recovery Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee. ""During World War II, he joined the Army Air Corps and flew support missions for the Flying Tigers of the 14th Air Force. Stevens was awarded numerous medals for his service, including the Distinguished Flying Cross,"" according to his Senate Web site. After the war, Stevens attended and graduated from both UCLA and Harvard Law School, and later practiced law in Alaska. He later moved to Washington to work in President Dwight Eisenhower's White House. After his stint in the White House, Stevens moved back to Alaska and ran for state representative. He was elected to the Alaska House in 1964. Four years later, Stevens was appointed to the U.S. Senate. In 1970, he was elected to finish his term in a special election mandated by state law, according to Stevens' Web site.  He has since been re-elected six times.","Ted Stevens of Alaska is the oldest serving GOP U.S. senator .

"(CNN) -- Australian tourist Michael Smith says he was eating lunch in a restaurant in Tibet's capital, Lhasa, on Friday when he heard an explosion and saw smoke. Video shot by an Australian tourist shows protesters in the streets of Lhasa, Tibet, last week. As armored vehicles and trucks carrying Chinese soldiers rushed past, Smith started videotaping. ""We're standing here in the middle of Lhasa and the place has just [expletive] exploded,"" Smith narrated during the rioting. Smith, who was traveling in Tibet when anti-Chinese rioting broke out Friday, returned home this week with dramatic video of the violence in  the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, which aired on Australian TV on Wednesday.  Watch Smith's video of chaos in streets » . Tibetan exile groups maintain at least 80 people were killed by Chinese security forces that day, but Chinese authorities insist they acted with restraint and killed no one. Instead, China says 13 ""innocent people"" were killed, some brutally burned, by the Tibetan rioters. No apparent deaths or injuries were seen on the video, which Smith shared with Australia's ABC News, a CNN affiliate. The video shows Tibetans smashing windows and setting fire to Chinese shops and cars, while people are heard cheering. It also shows Chinese security forces, but no clashes between them and the rioters. ""It's absolute mayhem on the streets,"" Smith said. Other video released of the rioting was broadcast by the Chinese government's CCTV, and it did not include pictures of Chinese security forces. Smith said as he made his way back to his hotel on Friday, he ""met so many Tibetan people on the streets, so many young Tibetan boys just screaming for Tibet's freedom."" ""We don't have any freedoms,"" one young Tibetan male shouted to Smith's camera. ""The Tibetan people are going crazy,"" Smith said.  See protests around the world over Tibet » . Many of the businesses targeted by the rioters were operated by Han Chinese, China's largest ethnic group. The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, has blamed the violent protests on deep resentment fueled by Chinese treatment of Tibetans as ""second-class citizens in their own land."" Tibetan activists said an influx of Han Chinese from other provinces is threatening their ancient culture. While many of these ""Free Tibet"" activists demand independence from China, the Dalai Lama said he  wants only ""genuine autonomy"" so that Tibetans can preserve their heritage.

""When the show ends and the music stops, the journey is made beautiful by having that someone to share it with. Thank you all for your support and prayers."" Vanessa Bryant filed for divorce in December 2011, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce filing came nearly 10 years after she famously stuck by him after he admitted to having sex with a woman at a Colorado hotel. Their marriage was thrust into the spotlight when the desk clerk at a Vail-area resort hotel told police that Kobe Bryant had sexually assaulted her in 2003. The Eagle County District Attorney filed charges against Bryant shortly after the accusation. At the time, Vanessa Bryant sat by her husband's side as he publicly apologized to her while admitting that he'd had consensual sex with the 19-year-old. Turning to his wife, Bryant said, ""You're a piece of my heart. You're the air I breathe. And you're the strongest person I know.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A soldier used the Quran -- Islam's holy book -- for target practice, forcing the chief U.S. commander in Baghdad to issue a formal apology on Saturday. Maj. Gen. Jeffery Hammond apologizes after a soldier admitted using the Quran for target practice. Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Hammond, commander of U.S. forces in Baghdad, flanked by leaders from Radhwaniya in the western outskirts of Baghdad, apologized for the staff sergeant who was a sniper section leader assigned to the headquarters of the 64th Armored Regiment. He also read a letter of apology by the shooter. It was the first time the incident -- which tested the relationship between U.S.-backed Sunni militiamen and the military -- was made public since it was discovered May 11. ""I come before you here seeking your forgiveness,"" Hammond said to tribal leaders and others at the apology ceremony. ""In the most humble manner I look in your eyes today and I say please forgive me and my soldiers.""  Watch villagers protest the Quran incident » . Another military official kissed a Quran and presented it as ""a humble gift"" to the tribal leaders. The soldier, whose name was not released, shot at a Quran on May 9, villagers said. The Quran used in the incident was discovered two days later, according to the military. Hammond also read from the shooter's letter: ""I sincerely hope that my actions have not diminished the partnership that our two nations have developed together. ... My actions were shortsighted, very reckless and irresponsible, but in my heart [the actions] were not malicious.""  Watch Hammond issue apology » . A tribal leader said ""the criminal act by U.S. forces"" took place at a shooting range at the Radhwaniya police station. After the shooters left, an Iraqi policeman found a target marked in the middle of the bullet-riddled Quran. Copies of the pictures of the Quran obtained by CNN show multiple bullet holes and an expletive scrawled on one of its pages. A military investigation found the shooter guilty and relieved him of duty; he will be redeployed to the United States for reassignment away from the 1st Brigade of the 4th Infantry Division, a U.S. official said. ""The actions of one soldier were nothing more than criminal behavior,"" Hammond said. ""I've come to this land to protect you, to support you -- not to harm you -- and the behavior of this soldier was nothing short of wrong and unacceptable."" Officials said the soldier claimed he wasn't aware the book was the Quran. U.S. officials rejected the claim. Tribal leaders, dignitaries and local security officials attended the ceremony, while residents carried banners and chanted slogans, including ""Yes, yes to the Quran"" and ""America out, out."" Sheikh Hamadi al-Qirtani, in a speech on behalf of all tribal sheiks of Radhwaniya, called the incident ""aggression against the entire Islamic world."" The Association of Muslim Scholars in Iraq also condemned the shooter's actions and the U.S. military's belated acknowledgment of the incident. ""As the Association of Muslim Scholars condemns this heinous crime against God's holy book, the Constitution of this nation, a source of pride and dignity,"" the groups statement said, ""they condemned the silence by all those who are part of the occupation's agenda and holds the occupation and the current government fully responsible for this violation and reminds everyone that God preserves his book and he [God] is a great avenger.""","U.S. soldier aims at Quran at police shooting range at Iraqi village .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the wake of the deadly Costa Concordia cruise ship accident off the coast of Italy in January, the cruise industry is implementing new safety standards. Cruise Lines International Association, the world's largest cruise non-profit organization representing 26 companies, announced Tuesday it is putting in place standards it says will ""achieve concrete, practical and significant safety dividends in the shortest possible time."" Officials say each ship will now be required to provide additional adult life jackets in excess of the legal requirements within a ship's most-populated zone. This will ensure the number of life jackets carried by a cruise liner will exceed the actual number of passengers on board. At least 30 people were killed and two others are missing and presumed dead after the Costa Concordia struck rocks and turned on its side January 13 off the Italian island of Giglio. Some survivors said they returned to their rooms to get their life jackets a half hour after the accident and struggled to climb many levels in dim emergency lighting on the listing ship to reach lifeboats. The industry also adopted a policy to ""minimize unnecessary disruptions and distractions"" on the bridge. The change will limit access to the bridge ""to those with operational functions during any period of restricted maneuvering or when increased vigilance is required."" The captain of the Costa Concordia faces allegations of manslaughter, causing the shipwreck, abandoning ship and failing to report the accident. Some media outlets reported that Capt. Francesco Schettino had a woman with him on the bridge just before the accident. Schettino has previously said managers of the cruise line instructed him to sail close to Giglio. He said the ship hit a rock not indicated on charts of the area. A third safety policy adopted involves passage planning procedures, which is the complete description of a ship's movement from departure to arrival. The new standard will change what was simply guidance for years and make it a mandatory minimum requirement. All bridge team members will be briefed on the voyage ""well in advance of its implementation"" by a designated officer and approved by the master. ""As the Concordia incident demonstrates, there is no such thing as perfect safety,"" said Manfredi Lefebvre, chairman of the European Cruise Council. ""We do strive for a perfect commitment to safety.""","The Costa Concordia hit rocks off the coast of Italy in January .

"(CNN) -- When the jack-o'-lanterns have all burned out and the candy wrappers have been swept away, Jim Warfield won't be hanging a ""closed"" sign in the window of the Raven's Grin Inn, the haunted mansion he runs in the small Illinois town of Mount Carroll. With its twisted passageways, secret tunnels and reported sightings of a ""Lady in White,"" the eerie 19th-century house draws visitors all year long -- and Warfield accommodates them. ""I always had a lot of fun with Halloween. I couldn't figure out why we could only do one week or one night,"" says the 63-year-old Warfield, who escorts tours through the spooky mansion all year, even when summer is in full swing. ""Why not try to have as much fun as you can?"" For those who relish the macabre and dressing up, October 31 doesn't have to spell the end of the fright season. From ghostly attractions to Halloween specialty shops, a small contingent of businesses can make it a year-long holiday. Costumes for every season . Once November hits, Heather George, vice president of Halloween Mart, a store that sells costumes, decorations and props, barely has time to take a breath before she's at her first trade show, getting ready to place orders for the next Halloween season. Halloween Mart, which occupies 25,000 square feet of retail space in Las Vegas, is open year-round. October is by far the store's busiest month, she says, but business is brisk the rest of the year. ""Vegas is a party town where everyone is always dressing up. There's always a little more fun going on. All the bars and nightclubs do themed events in the off-season,"" says George. Quiz: Know your ghosts from your goblins? Being a year-round operation gives the massive store, which also houses a warehouse for its online business, an edge over the flurry of temporary shops that pop up during the Halloween season. ""We cater to our clientele. We'll stock a lot more product than a temporary store will ever stock,"" George says, adding that the store's own ""haunted hallway"" is an attraction in itself. The idea of Halloween as a year-round industry is growing, albeit slowly, she says. ""I don't think it's everywhere but I do see more and more types of retailers carrying this type of product in the off-season."" Fast-growing holiday . Nearly three-quarters of Americans will celebrate Halloween this year, according to a survey conducted for the National Retail Federation (NRF). That's up from just over 50% in 2005. The NRF estimates Halloween spending will reach a record $8 billion this year. The holiday is also growing outside of the U.S., notably in the UK, where Planet Retail estimates Halloween sales will rise to almost $549 million this year. Patrick Konopelski, president of the Haunted Attraction Association, an organization representing more than 2,500 haunts, links the ever-growing popularity of Halloween to the desire to be entertained. Read more: How to shoot frighteningly good photos this Halloween . ""People today more than ever want to experience life,"" he says. Halloween-inspired attractions like haunts aren't just a passing fad. They're ""now part of the culture,"" says Konopelski. Year-round attractions are still in the minority, but that's mainly due to their business models. It just isn't financially feasible for large attractions, which can be expensive to run, to stay open all year, Konopelski says. For example, Shocktoberfest, a scream park he owns, employs as many as 100 people. ""When you have that many people on payroll you have to put through thousands and thousands of people, and a short season is incredibly efficient,"" he says. But the demand is there, he says. ""This generation is a non-spectator generation. They want to participate in an experience."" For a small operator like Warfield, it makes sense to keep going the way he has. Up to a dozen people might help out around Halloween, but for the rest of the year, he's a one-man show. Whether in June or October, he starts every tour in the same place. Standing in the parlor, he begins telling the history of the house of horrors in his gravelly voice. And even though he's been at it for a quarter-century, it doesn't get tiresome. ""I never get tired of hearing people laughing and screaming,"" he says. ""I have tremendous fun. No one has more fun than I do. I hope to be doing this when I'm 95 years old.""","Halloween is just a wild weekend for most, but for others it's a year-long occupation .

"(CNN) -- Call it the debate before the debates. In this corner: Alex Anderson, a college student in Hillsdale, Michigan, pulling for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. In that corner: Omekongo Dibinga, a longtime iReporter from Washington and a supporter of President Barack Obama. Both had a chance to see their candidates' political conventions, as winners of the Your Political Ticket iReport contest. With that experience behind them, we asked them to go head to head on Google+ previewing Wednesday's first presidential debate. They are two of hundreds of iReporters who have added their views to the iReport debate, an eight-month project that invites voters to make their voices heard this election season. What to watch in tonight's debate . We came away with three main points from the conversation, some of which you can see in the video above. 1. How important is a 'personal connection?' ""The biggest plus [Obama] has over Romney are the social issues,"" said Dibinga. ""When you look at issues such as immigration and his educational stances, it seems to me that President Obama is in line with the majority of Americans."" Anderson said that the president may be able to connect personally with Americans on certain issues and in speeches, but rhetoric and action are two different things. ""Through his time at Bain Capital, with the Olympics and his time as governor [of Massachusetts, Romney] had results from his actions. Candidates 'tics,' actions matter in debates . 2. Weighing the past versus the future . Anderson echoed Romney's contention that Obama has not left Americans better off than four years ago. He said that Romney has laid out incentives as to what would happen under his presidency, and portrayed Obama as saying that Americans should ""ignore"" the past four years. Dibinga said that Obama can't tout unemployment in this country as long as it's over 8%, but at the same time, Romney cannot point to his record as governor. ""Some things [he did] such as health care are similar to President Obama. Romney will increase our issues as to the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer; setting women's rights back; and setting education back."" 3. Debate the big picture . Anderson hoped the debates will help paint a better picture of each candidate's plan for America. He also hoped that ""small things"" like ""tax returns and birth certificates"" would not dominate the debates. On this point, Dibinga agreed. ""No cheap shots. Romney and Obama have very different views on where the country should go. The issues are strong enough for Americans to decide for themselves.""

"(CNN) -- For most of his life, Marlon Jackson was shy. He was the kind who would stand in the corner at a party swaying side-to-side, quietly sipping on a beer while others danced and socialized. ""We called him Fudgie,"" Marlon's cousin, Juarez Jackson, said. ""Fudgie was a great cousin with a smile that could light up an entire room. He was not the person with the most words, but he had a great sense of humor and personality."" CNN first learned about Marlon when his name was added to the Home & Away database, an interactive memorial for the troops who have lost their lives fighting in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Thanks to Juarez, we were given an opportunity to learn more. Marlon was nicknamed Fudgie after a character in a reggae song who was known for being outgoing and was quite the ladies man, someone who Marlon was not. Juarez, a native of Kingston, Jamaica, explained that it is common in Jamaican culture to give someone a nickname that is opposite of who they really are. ""If someone's big, we call them smally. If they're tall, we call them shorty,"" Juarez said. ""It was kind of a play on him not being that outgoing and him being a real introvert."" Marlon was born in Jamaica and adopted at nine by Leighton Jackson and Lois La Grenade and a few years later, he moved to New Jersey with his adopted father. Around 14, his cousins in Georgia, who he would visit often, dubbed him Fudgie. He often introduced himself to others using the obverse nickname. ""He loved it,"" Juarez said. ""Everybody called him Fudgie, and he got a big kick out of it."" Marlon might have been quiet, but according to Juarez, when he did talk, he always had something interesting to say. ""Some people, they don't need to say anything and they just have that way about them,"" Juarez said. ""Everyone listened when he said something because he rarely spoke. (Marlon was) just very on point with the words that came out of his mouth."" But when Marlon enlisted with the U.S. Army in 1999, Juarez saw a big change in his cousin's personality. He started to break out of his shell and became more confident in himself, something his cousin wants people to remember. ""I want people to remember him giving it all but also remember how the service made him better,"" Juarez said. ""I saw how great Marlon had become as an individual. He still had his introvert self, but he was just way more confident, way more powerful as a person. It was great to see that, and I know it was the Army that brought that out of him. I don't think there is anywhere else that could have done that to him like the service did."" When Marlon enlisted, pre-September 11, 2001, it never crossed his cousin's mind that one day he might see combat. ""The most war you'd hear going on is between Biggie and Tupac and they just passed away,"" Juarez said. ""You never thought about any global war going on. That was in the back of our minds."" Even when Marlon was deployed to Iraq in March of 2003, Juarez never thought that Fudgie might not return. But when his uncle told him on November 13, 2003, that Marlon had been killed by a roadside bomb two days prior, on Veterans Day, his whole life changed. ""In your 20s, you don't think that someone is going to pass away. You just don't think that someone is going to be 25 and not be here anymore,"" Juarez said. ""It was kind of hard to believe."" At the time of Marlon's death, Juarez was in college studying computer science. He had known since he was in the sixth grade that he wanted to be a software engineer, but he did not know in what capacity until his younger brother started working in the defense industry and cousin Marlon enlisted in the Army. ""It was an encouragement to me to do something that I thought was more meaningful,"" Juarez said. ""What Marlon did, what soldiers do, that makes a difference. That's shaping the world. That's shaping the future."" Juarez started working for the defense industry in 2005 as a software engineer, and one of his first projects involved outfitting U.S. military Humvees with armor that could help protect troops from rocket-propelled grenades and improvised explosive devices, something that Juarez believes could have possibly saved his cousin. Juarez is still with the defense industry, working side-by-side with service members from all around the world. He knows that what he and his fellow engineers do makes a difference, and he loves that they are all working towards the same goal: helping the brave men and women serving in the armed forces. ""I think (Marlon) would have been proud of the accomplishments that my brother and I have made,"" Juarez said. ""I am just kind of disappointed that he's not here to share in some of this."" But to this day, Juarez can't say he has bad feelings about his cousin going to war. ""He did an admirable thing. He did something that I think is one of the highest callings you can have in life -- to serve other people. He did that with zeal and gusto, and no one had to pull him dragging to do it. He did it because he wanted to do it, and he knew it was something that would make him better.""","Spc. Marlon Jackson was killed when a roadside bomb detonated in Iraq in 2003 .

Charles Juan Proctor was convicted this month of 22 charges including robbery and attempted murder in connection with the slashing spree, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said. On Monday, Long Beach Superior Court Court Judge Gary Ferrari sentenced the 45-year-old man to 433 years plus 11 life sentences. Proctor was also ordered to pay about $58,000 in restitution to two women he knifed in the throat, prosecutors said. In all, there were six women who were attacked, prosecutors said. Most of Proctor's victims were shop owners attacked at their places of business, authorities said. The remaining victims were shop employees. ""One of the most brutal of the attacks was the slashing of a woman who sustained a four-inch wound to the neck, plus stab wounds to her face and head,"" the district attorney's office said. The man was dubbed 'the box cutter"" by police during the 2008 terror spree, CNN-affiliate KTLA reported. Prosecutors said all the women were held at the point of a knife or box-cutter during the robberies, the affiliate reported. ""You are a violent and dangerous human being. Your conduct toward these victims is absolutely despicable,"" the judge told Proctor during the sentencing, according to the affiliate. ""It's unconscionable what you did to these women.

"Editor's note: This story is part of Eileen Ogintz's Taking the Kids series. Follow ""taking the kids"" on www.twitter.com, where Ogintz welcomes your questions and comments. (Tribune Media Services)  -- No one cares that the water is cold. The kids splash at the lake's edge, play on the small sand beach as older, daring ones splash in the water and peddle kayaks, rowboats and paddleboats. Our pup eyes them all curiously. Lake Placid, New York -- home to two Olympics -- is that iconic old-fashioned vacation spot that works as well for 21st-century families -- and their pooches -- as it did a century ago for families and millionaires who came here to the Adirondacks with their family and friends. With 6 million acres, Adirondack State Park is the largest state park in the United States, larger than Yellowstone, Everglades, Glacier and Grand Canyon national parks combined. It boasts more than 3,000 lakes and 2,000 miles of hiking trails and offers kayaking, canoeing, fishing and mountain biking. (The Whiteface Downhill Mountain Bike Park features 27 downhill and cross-country mountain bike trails that run between the ski trails, through streams and woods.) Lake Placid, a town where everyone seems to be an athlete, or at least an outdoors enthusiast, has only 3,000 residents, but that number swells close to 10,000 in summer. Main Street overlooks Mirror Lake and it's lined with ice cream and coffee shops, all variety of restaurants (sushi, Mexican, steaks, a brewery, even a creperie, some with outdoor patios) and stores selling New York state maple syrup, local chocolate, antique ski posters, local wines and cuddly stuffed moose. Families stroll up and down Main clutching kids' hands, pushing them in strollers, hanging on to dogs, picnicking in front of the lake at the outdoor band shell. (Simply Gourmet is the spot for first-rate sandwiches and cookies for your hikes and picnics.) ""The kids love it because it's so safe we can let them go out on their own,"" said Louise McEachran, here with a group of young freestyle skiers from Ontario who practice their tricks by jumping into an icy pool at the MacKenzie-Intervale Ski Jumping Complex. (You can test your mettle at the Olympic Sports Complex and ride a wheeled bobsled, or check out the view of the Adirondacks from the top of the 26-story Olympic ski jump. Come July 4 and watch the 50th annual ski jump competition. ""Whatever the season there is something for the kids to do,"" adds Suzanne Boger, an attorney from Saratoga Springs, New York, who comes here often -- winter and summer -- with her two kids, husband and two dogs. We meet them hiking and splashing in Lake Placid along the Peninsula Trails that run for miles. Our puppy, Trooper, happily joined in. ""Even when the weather is bad, there are things to do."" (Bowling anyone?) There's even some Civil War history when you visit Abolitionist John Brown's farm and gravesite. But what sets this place apart -- besides the natural beauty and Olympic history, as if that weren't enough -- is how genuinely friendly people are. It couldn't be more kid friendly, Boger said. Pooch-friendly too. We learn that first-hand at the 166-room Golden Arrow Lakeside Resort, which has an idyllic location on Mirror Lake (smaller than Lake Placid and ideal for young families). The Holderied family has run the Golden Arrow for more than 30 years, attracting families who return again and again. ""We love the family-style management and the kids loved pretending to work behind the desk,"" said Lisa Tinker of New Jersey. Her family visits twice a year -- winter and summer. Besides having fun, the kids might learn a thing or two about vacationing greener. The resort is the first, and so far only, one in the United State to achieve 5 Green Leaf Rating from the Audubon Society for its green initiatives. There are small touches like the paper shopping bags in each room to encourage guests to recycle cans and bottles. There is an allergen-free floor, bamboo flooring, a blooming green roof and sand, even small-framed placards placed around the hotel pointing out the green features. (Kids are invited to take a ""green quiz,"" getting a Mr. Green coloring book, with suggestions on what they could do at home to be more earth friendly (recycling one aluminum can conserves enough energy to run a TV for three hours.) ""We want kids especially to realize they can help,"" says Jenn Holderied, the youngest of the three siblings now overseeing the hotel, which was first bought by their parents, who spearheaded the green initiatives. ""The things you can do aren't difficult,"" she says. ""Our goal is to get people thinking about it."" That extends to the resort restaurant, Generations, where the family is set to harvest dinners, inviting farmers to showcase their wares. Eventually, Holdleried, the mom of two young children, hopes families will be able to visit the area farms and see first-hand where the food on their plates came from. Some families who come here might prefer a cabin or condo, though, and there are certainly plenty to choose from at every price point. If you're coming with grown kids and want a laid back but luxurious respite -- or want to feel like you were one of those millionaires from a century-ago, check out the 30-roomLake Placid Lodge, which was rebuilt after a fire to resemble a traditional Great House. The Lodge, however, doesn't welcome kids under 12 (unless you book the entire place), but will pamper your dog. The Mirror Lake Inn touts itself as summer camp-plus. It's located on a lake with swimming, canoeing, kayaking and fishing. But there's also a spa, three gourmet restaurants and, they promise, serenely comfy beds. The Summer Savings Package starts at $299 per couple per night and kids are free. Book two nights by June 21 to take advantage of this special rate and also receive a $50 resort credit. The Whiteface Lodge on the other hand has got everything a family could want. Though not on the lake, it maintains a private beach a half-mile away with the requisite canoes, kayaks and more. This is the kind of place that offers the convenience of deluxe condos in the woods with the amenities of a first-class resort. (Look for deals with substantial resort credits.) There's a big heated pool, fitness center and spa where even tweens can get massages or facials with mom. There's an old-fashioned two-lane bowling alley, tennis courts and a stocked pond (yes, they even supply reels and bait), an ice cream parlor and game room equipped with everything from fooseball to pool to Ping-Pong. Make s'mores every night in front of an outdoor fireplace, watch movies in the theater downstairs or just stargaze. Parents will appreciate that the Whiteface Lodge also offers complimentary organized activities for kids as young as three and this summer Whiteface has expanded its activities to outdoor programs for tweens and young teens. How about learning orienteering with the Adirondacks as your playground? ""It may be touristy,"" laughed Suzanne Boger. But then she gestures across the spectacular lake, with Whiteface Mountain in the distance. ""There are plenty of places to get away from the crowds."" With the kids -- and your dog, of course.

"(CNN) -- Alex Ferguson is in siege mode. The manager of soccer club Manchester United has been so stung by widespread criticism of his actions this week that he claims the sole person not to have commented is Barack Obama -- and that's only because he's busy trying to stop the U.S. economy falling over a fiscal cliff. Ferguson, who recently gave a talk on his management techniques at Harvard, has been under fire following a verbal exchange with referee Mike Dean and his assistants during Wednesday's controversial 4-3 win over Newcastle. It led to Newcastle manager Alan Pardew claiming that Ferguson should have been punished for his protests over Dean's failure to disallow Jonny Evans' own-goal for what he believed to be offside. The Scot was furious that Dean overruled his assistant, Jake Collin, who had flagged to give Papiss Cisse offside before Evans diverted the ball into his own net. RVP controversy: Has Ferguson gone too far? Ferguson, who turns 71 on December 31, will escape punishment from the English Football Association because the incident was not mentioned in the referee's report, much to Pardew's astonishment. It was the second match in four days where Ferguson has courted controversy, having claimed that his striker Robin van Persie ""could have been killed"" after Swansea's Ashley Williams kicked a ball at his head in Sunday's 1-1 draw. And the United manager has defended his conduct, stating that everybody is suddenly keen to have an opinion -- apart from the man inside the White House. ""The problem for me and Manchester United is that the profile of the club is huge,"" Ferguson told reporters. ""Alan Pardew has come out and criticized me. Alan Pardew is the worst at haranguing referees -- his whole staff (do it) every game. He was at it for the whole game on Wednesday. ""He shoves the linesman and laughs about it and he has to cheek to criticize me. It is unbelievable. He forgets the help I gave him, by the way. ""The press have a good field day. They have addressed every possible angle, the only one they have not asked is Barack Obama -- he is too busy. ""It's unfortunate that I carry that, because I'm the manager of the biggest club in the world. I'm not like Newcastle -- a wee club in the North East. ""That is the facts of life. I was demonstrative but I was not out of order. That has been overplayed by the press. You've all had a field day."" Hernandez winner lifts Manchester United . Ferguson was reacting after Pardew had given his views on the incident at Old Trafford. Pardew told reporters: ""I think Mike Dean might feel slightly disappointed he didn't do something about it. ""I think the pressure that was on him was tough for a referee to take. Sometimes when you reflect on a game you think you might have acted differently. You do that as a manager and I think he might have done that as a referee. ""But it's an emotional game and apparently they had a cordial discussion. I've had a few of those myself and sometimes I've ended up in the stands as a result of that cordial discussion."" Ferguson seemed particularly irked by the comments, and referred to Pardew's own altercation with a referee during a Premier League match in August. Van Persie 'could have been killed' Pardew was fined $32,000 and given a two-match touchline ban after pushing an assistant referee during his side's 2-1 home win over Tottenham. ""Some managers shove linesman on the pitch and make a joke of it. I'm not making a joke of this. I think it should have been disallowed, I really do,"" Ferguson said. ""There was no ranting and raving from me. I was demonstrative but then I am always demonstrative -- everyone knows that. I'm an emotional guy. ""What happened was that Dean was walking towards the center circle and I came up to the touchline and he came towards me and I went towards him. I was not on the pitch for more than three or four yards. Then we came off together.""","Alex Ferguson defends himself after fierce criticism from Newcastle manager Alan Pardew .

"(CNN) -- Nancy Ayala arrived in the U.S. 11 years ago, at the age of 9. ""Why did I move to the States? I still don't know. For a better education, for a better life,"" she said. One of her biggest dreams was to join the Marines, but at 17, Ayala -- the first in her family to graduate high school -- discovered that she couldn't enlist because she didn't have a Social Security number. ""I had dreams, but I had no way to complete them,"" she said. ""Sadly, my whole family is undocumented."" Ayala soon moved back to her home country of Mexico but now regrets doing so: ""I've been here for 10 months. I cry every night, missing my family, and God knows when IÂ´ll see them again."" When President Obama announced June 15 that some young immigrants would no longer be deported, Ayala was happy. At the same time, she believed the policy change would not help her. ""There's no way back for me. How can I apply? What can I do? Nothing."" Obama's announcement and the Supreme Court's subsequent rejection of all but one provision of a controversial immigration law in Arizona this week have brought the issue back into the spotlight. Like Ayala and others across the country, many of the iReporters who posted their views had a personal stake in the broader issue of immigration. Their opinions were nuanced and widely varied but had one thing in common: Most did not believe that the recent changes and rulings will have a direct effect on them -- or would have helped them in the past. Corrine Kay of Gaithersburg, Maryland, said she has had a years-long issue with immigration. ""All immigration to these United States should be done legally, abiding by the laws of our great nation,"" she said. ""My husband and I are doing exactly that, taking an excessively long time and great expense to do so."" Kay was married in Egypt but has been waiting for three years for her husband to get a visa in order to live with her in the U.S. ""I realized, I must not be alone, as there are certainly other Americans who deal with the pains of having to make do and go through the motions of life while missing their loved ones so,"" she said. Even so, Kay said, she can understand why some people cross the border illegally. ""They don't all have motives to smuggle contraband into the country or undermine our homeland security. They are simply trying to find a way to survive, escape systemic violence within their own politically dysfunctional governments and make for a stable and happy family life for the ones they love,"" she reasoned. Diana Carey's mother sought out a new life for her family in America. As a young child, Carey knew that her family could be sent home at any time. ""Being in a country illegally is a scary and difficult situation for children, and it is not a decision they made or were mentally equipped to make,"" said Carey, whose family came from Ecuador. ""But for that same reason, I think adults who have made the decision to come to the U.S. illegally have to face reality."" That reality includes the possibility of being deported. Carey no longer has to face that, since her mother married a U.S. citizen: ""It was an enormous sigh of relief to say the least."" Her experience led her to get involved with advocacy groups. ""I was involved in activism in favor of illegal immigration and the halt on deportations for a bit, but I made the decision to no longer support these groups,"" she said. ""I don't agree with their strategies. There need to be more compelling arguments based more on logic and less heart. They want their supporters to feel bad for illegal immigrants, but no responsibility is taken whatsoever for the fact that an adult stayed here illegally."" At the same time, Carey was happy to see so much of the Arizona law struck down. ""I always thought the Arizona law was a bit extreme and based on fear while targeting mostly one race/background,"" she said. ""While I never want anyone to ask my son for his birth certificate because he looks Hispanic, I want him to know that when you do something illegal, you will face negative consequences, and you shouldn't expect forgiveness, only hope for it."" Even though the recent immigration decisions don't affect him now, Sajiv Pandya believes they might have 20 years ago. Now a U.S. citizen living in Maryland, Pandya still recalls being stopped by the Border Patrol in 1991 for four hours outside Yuma, Arizona. ""I was a citizen of the United Kingdom, but I was a third-generation Kenyan of Indian ethnicity,"" he said. ""I don't look 'white,' and so I was held on the grounds that I was Mexican until I could prove otherwise."" More than 20 years later, Pandya said he is in favor of ""comprehensive legal immigration and for strict compliance to immigration rules."" ""I followed rules to become a U.S. citizen, and I don't think it is fair for someone to jump the line or not even stand in line,"" he explained. Pandya opposes ""random stops"" by authorities, however. ""I am happy that the Supreme Court ruling struck down three of the four major provisions. The fourth one, which they upheld, is precisely what impacted me and which I think is going to continue to be abused if it is not further challenged,"" he said, referring to the controversial provision that allows police checks on people's immigration status while enforcing other laws. Pandya said he is ""a little aghast"" at the partisan nature of the immigration debate. ""Comprehensive immigration rules need to be a bipartisan effort at a federal level and and must follow a process that is fair to all,"" he said. Despite their different views and experiences, these iReporters all want the same thing Ayala wants. ""I want my voice to be heard; I want to chase my dreams; I want my family to be free, and I want them to live the American dream,"" she said.","iReporters with varying personal experiences with immigration shared their views .

"(CNN) -- In the wake of Japan's nuclear disaster, all milk, milk products, fresh vegetables and fruit from one of four prefectures closest to the quake-stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant will be prevented from entering the United States, a spokesperson for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday. All other food products produced or manufactured in one of those prefectures -- Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi and Gunma -- will be diverted for testing, the spokesperson said. Food products from other parts of Japan will be tested as resources allow, but the FDA's main focus is food from these four areas, the spokesperson said. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered damage from the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on March 11. Efforts to bring the plant's cooling systems back online to stabilize the situation continue. Some of these food products have already been officially taken off the domestic and export markets: Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan had previously ordered the governors of these four prefectures to halt the distribution of spinach and the local vegetable kakina and told the governor of Fukushima to cease all raw milk distribution, the FDA said. The FDA will continue to flag all entries from Japan in order to determine whether they originated from the affected area, the spokesperson said. Levels of radioactive iodine in milk were found in four locations in Fukushima that ranged from about 20% over the acceptable limit to more than 17 times that limit, Japanese officials said Sunday. Testing at one location also found levels of cesium about 5% over the acceptable limit, the health ministry reported Sunday. And in Ibaraki, a major center of vegetable production, tests at 10 locations found iodine levels in spinach that ranged from 5% over acceptable limits to more than 27 times that ceiling. At seven sites, levels of cesium grew from just above 4% to nearly four times the limit. Keep in mind that the United States only imports 4% of food from Japan in general. And consuming the affected milk and spinach every day for a year would translate into taking in the same amount of radiation as a single CT scan, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano has said.","Milk, milk products, produce from parts of Japan affected .
Other food products closest to nuclear plant will be diverted for testing .

"(CNN) -- A mountain lion was killed in a car accident in Milford, Connecticut, on Saturday and authorities say the cat may have been the same one spotted this week in nearby Greenwich. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection says it responded to a State Police call about 1 a.m. Saturday morning reporting a collision between a 2006 Hyundai Tucson SUV and a mountain lion in the area of Exit 55 of Route 15 in Milford. The mountain lion died of injuries in the crash, but the SUV driver was uninjured. Connecticut DEP says it's possible and even likely that the mountain lion killed early Saturday morning is the same cat that's been roaming around Greenwich this month. The animal was last seen Sunday on the campus of a college prep school. The 140-pound male cat is at a DEP facility where his body, along with paw prints and other specimens are being analyzed and tested to determine if it is the same cat seen in Greenwich. There is no native population of mountain lions in Connecticut, the DEP says, and the eastern mountain lion has been declared extinct by federal authorities. They are able to roam long distances, according to the DEP. Milford is about 40 miles north of Greenwich, which DEP says would have easily been within the cat's roaming range.","Connecticut official says it is most likely the same cat that was seen in Greenwich .

"(CNN) -- For most of his life, Marlon Jackson was shy. He was the kind who would stand in the corner at a party swaying side-to-side, quietly sipping on a beer while others danced and socialized. ""We called him Fudgie,"" Marlon's cousin, Juarez Jackson, said. ""Fudgie was a great cousin with a smile that could light up an entire room. He was not the person with the most words, but he had a great sense of humor and personality."" CNN first learned about Marlon when his name was added to the Home & Away database, an interactive memorial for the troops who have lost their lives fighting in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Thanks to Juarez, we were given an opportunity to learn more. Marlon was nicknamed Fudgie after a character in a reggae song who was known for being outgoing and was quite the ladies man, someone who Marlon was not. Juarez, a native of Kingston, Jamaica, explained that it is common in Jamaican culture to give someone a nickname that is opposite of who they really are. ""If someone's big, we call them smally. If they're tall, we call them shorty,"" Juarez said. ""It was kind of a play on him not being that outgoing and him being a real introvert."" Marlon was born in Jamaica and adopted at nine by Leighton Jackson and Lois La Grenade and a few years later, he moved to New Jersey with his adopted father. Around 14, his cousins in Georgia, who he would visit often, dubbed him Fudgie. He often introduced himself to others using the obverse nickname. ""He loved it,"" Juarez said. ""Everybody called him Fudgie, and he got a big kick out of it."" Marlon might have been quiet, but according to Juarez, when he did talk, he always had something interesting to say. ""Some people, they don't need to say anything and they just have that way about them,"" Juarez said. ""Everyone listened when he said something because he rarely spoke. (Marlon was) just very on point with the words that came out of his mouth."" But when Marlon enlisted with the U.S. Army in 1999, Juarez saw a big change in his cousin's personality. He started to break out of his shell and became more confident in himself, something his cousin wants people to remember. ""I want people to remember him giving it all but also remember how the service made him better,"" Juarez said. ""I saw how great Marlon had become as an individual. He still had his introvert self, but he was just way more confident, way more powerful as a person. It was great to see that, and I know it was the Army that brought that out of him. I don't think there is anywhere else that could have done that to him like the service did."" When Marlon enlisted, it had been almost a decade since the United States was directly involved in a war. It never crossed his cousin's mind that one day he might see combat. ""The most war you'd hear going on is between Biggie and Tupac and they just passed away,"" Juarez said. ""You never thought about any global war going on. That was in the back of our minds."" Even when Marlon was deployed to Iraq in March of 2003, Juarez never thought that Fudgie might not return. But when his uncle told him on November 13, 2003, that Marlon had been killed by a roadside bomb two days prior, on Veterans Day, his whole life changed. ""In you 20s, you don't think that someone is going to pass away. You just don't think that someone is going to be 25 and not be here anymore,"" Juarez said. ""It was kind of hard to believe."" At the time of Marlon's death, Juarez was in college studying computer science. He had known since he was in the sixth grade that he wanted to be a software engineer, but he did not know in what capacity until his younger brother started working in the defense industry and cousin Marlon enlisted in the Army. ""It was an encouragement to me to do something that I thought was more meaningful,"" Juarez said. ""What Marlon did, what soldiers do, that makes a difference. That's shaping the world. That's shaping the future."" Juarez started working for the defense industry in 2005 as a software engineer, and one of his first projects involved outfitting U.S. military Humvees with armor that could help protect troops from rocket-propelled grenades and improvised explosive devices, something that Juarez believes could have possibly saved his cousin. Juarez is still with the defense industry, working side-by-side with service members from all around the world. He knows that what he and his fellow engineers do makes a difference, and he loves that they are all working towards the same goal: helping the brave men and women serving in the armed forces. ""I think (Marlon) would have been proud of the accomplishments that my brother and I have made,"" Juarez said. ""I am just kind of disappointed that he's not here to share in some of this."" But to this day, Juarez can't say has bad feelings about his cousin going to war. ""He did an admirable thing. He did something that I think is one of the highest callings you can have in life -- to serve other people. He did that with zeal and gusto, and no one had to pull him dragging to do it. He did it because he wanted to do it, and he knew it was something that would make him better.""","Spc. Marlon Jackson was killed when a roadside bomb detonated in Iraq in 2003 .

"(CNN) -- Monday marks one year since a Chinook helicopter crashed in Afghanistan and killed 30 American service members, 22 of them Navy SEALs. Many of the SEALs belonged to Team 6, the unit whose members were involved in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. A few days after the August 6, 2011, tragedy, a 10-year-old boy in Kansas City, Missouri, composed an iReport on CNN.com. He uploaded a photo of his dad sitting alongside his fellow soldiers. My father was one of the 30 US Soldiers killed in Afghanistan yesterday with the Seals rescue mission. My father was the pilot of the chinook. I have seen other pictures of victims from this deadly mission and wish you would include a picture of my father. He is the farthest to the left. Braydon Nichols' heartbreaking letter urging the world never to forget his father, Army Chief Warrant Officer Bryan Nichols, sparked thousands of comments and at least 230 iReports filled with love and support for the boy. Read the original iReport . Over the past year, readers have continued to post kind notes to Braydon. ""Thought about you and looked at the picture I have and thought to visit this page and letting you know that you were on my mind. Hope you and your family are doing well,"" Dennis Stahl from Columbus, Ohio, commented July 12. ""Still on my mind buddy. I hope you and mom are doing OK, thoughts and prayers,"" Bob wrote June 25. ""I found myself remembering your story and tribute to your daddy this morning Braydon. I just wanted to let you know that people are and will always be thinking about him,"" another reader wrote in June. Army veteran Shane Farlin told CNN that Braydon's story made him think about how close he came to losing his life and the chance to watch his son grow up. The 28-year-old from Michigan was wounded in Iraq in 2004. He left this post on Braydon's story: . ""I was wounded and holding on weakly, wanting to meet my son. I cry reading this thinking of my Army brothers who didn't get a chance to come home. Peace to the dead and wounded of this country and their families."" Farlin and his unit were returning from Fallujah in May 2004, speeding along a highway back to Baghdad. The machine gunner was looking out of their truck and noticed the gutter running alongside them was black, scorched. Then a roadside bomb exploded. ""It felt like someone hit me in the face with a baseball bat. My head snapped back. It felt like someone was pouring thick olive oil down my face. I could feel the metal on my face and I fell into my partner's lap screaming,"" he said this week. One eye was hanging out its socket; the other socket was shredded. ""It's what they always say happens. I was thinking about my unit but I was also thinking about my high school sweetheart. She got pregnant right before I deployed. And I'm screaming but I'm thinking, 'I never got to see her pregnant, I never got to feel her belly.'"" Farlin knew he was going to have a son. His face soaked and his buddies screaming, all Farlin could think was: I'm going to have a son. I'm going to be a father. He started to feel his body go slack. It felt good, this odd sensation of relaxation. ""I was slipping away,"" he remembered. While a medivac rushed to the site, Farlin passed out. He woke up in a hospital bed in Baghdad's fortified Green Zone. It took him a week to regain his sight in one eye. The other was too damaged and he lost it. Farlin recovered, slowly and agonizingly, and made it back home for the birth of his son. He was working at a base at the time, and wearing his uniform, when he rushed to the hospital to help deliver Shane Farlin II. That was years ago. Farlin's boy is 7. ""When I read about Braydon, I just ... felt it. Those who are out there, fighting, they have their last moments, or what they believe is going to be their last moments, and they're thinking about home and their kids. I am so glad I made it."" Little Shane is Farlin's ""clone,"" just as Braydon Nichols was so much like his father. ""My son is off the wall,"" Farlin said. ""Spiderman one minute, Ironman the next minute. He's helpful, always wanting to know how he can help Daddy. He wants to be like me. He wants to know what the Army was like."" Farlin has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and has a traumatic brain injury, he said. Readjusting to life outside the military and his transition to being a college student hasn't always been easy. He gets sad. He doesn't like that he cannot be in the Army any longer because of his injury -- he has a glass eye. But Farlin is constantly trying to be positive around his son. ""I know to be careful about what I say in front of him,"" he said. ""I don't want my son to see me sad. I am going to keep him from that for as long as I can."" For the Nichols family, sadness is always there. Some days are better than others. ""We all deal with it differently,"" said Monte Nichols, Brian Nichols' brother. ""So many people have reached out and tried to help Braydon over the past year, to let him know that they care and they're thinking about his dad."" Braydon is getting good grades and doing as well as any kid could, Monte Nichols added. A memorial service for those killed in the Chinook crash was held at Arlington National Cemetery in June. ""Everyone who was lost,"" Monte Nichols said, ""is very much missed. Nobody is forgotten.""","On August 6, 2011, a U.S. helicopter crashed in Afghanistan, killing 30 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Problems were reported across the country during the first-ever nationwide test Wednesday of the Emergency Alert System, designed to allow the president to address the American people during a national emergency. Some television and radio stations did not air the planned 30-second test at all. Some that aired it stayed with the signal longer than others. There were anecdotal reports of TV stations failing to air the message in Washington, Atlanta, New York, California and elsewhere. The message did not air on a cable channel being monitored in a Capitol Hill office and in the Capitol's radio and TV gallery. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Federal Communications Commission, which ordered the test, stressed that it was designed to find flaws, and scoffed at reports the system had failed. By late Wednesday afternoon, an FCC official, not authorized to speak on the record, said about one-third of the test participants had filed preliminary reports, and those showed that 80% to 90% of the stations received the alert and were able to rebroadcast it, which was the major goal of the test. The official called the failure rate of more than 10% ""not insignificant,"" but said identifying problems ""is why we have the test."" He said the glitches were found in all modes of transmission -- broadcast, cable and satellite -- and it was too early to establish patterns. ""We'll dig back into it,"" he said. ""The nationwide EAS Test served the purpose for which it was intended -- to identify gaps and generate a comprehensive set of data to help strengthen our ability to communicate during real emergencies,"" said Neil Derek Grace, FCC spokesman, in a released statement. ""Large areas of the country received the test but some areas did not. We are currently in the process of collecting and analyzing data, and will reach a conclusion when that process is complete."" A FEMA statement issued shortly after the test made no reference to problems, except to say the agency looks forward ""to working with all our stakeholders to improve this current technology and build a robust, resilient and fully accessible next generation alerting system."" ""I'm surprised about the amount of trouble I'm hearing about,"" said warning expert Art Botterell. ""My overall impression is -- I kind of hoped for better."" In the office of Katherine Hern, a manager of warning systems for the Contra Costa, California, county government, screens ""froze up"" immediately before the test, Hern said. When co-workers tried to turn to other stations, they were unable to, and had to ""not only power down the TV, but power down the cable box"" to restore service to the television, she said. A cable industry group said late Wednesday that it is in the process of gathering feedback from its member companies. ""We do know that in many places, the Emergency Alert Notification flowed through to viewers without a hitch. However, we also know that in some places, it did not,"" said Joy Sims, spokeswoman for the National Cable & Telecommunications Association. Stations must report the results to the FCC within 45 days. The FCC says it will not release specific test data to the public because broadcasters worry that potentially embarrassing results could discourage participation in future tests, and test data could reveal security vulnerabilities. The test was the first ""end-to-end"" national test, starting with a tone sent from a FEMA operations center in Washington that was relayed to radio stations and then broadcast simultaneously on TV and radio stations in the United States. The Emergency Alert System is regularly used -- and tested -- to notify communities about tornadoes, child abductions and other events. But all previous tests have been local or regional, and involve the voluntary compliance of broadcasters. Wednesday's test was the first national test featuring a live ""presidential"" alert code, which instructed TV and radio stations that the alert took priority over all other programming. ""I think the biggest reason nobody ever tested it was because of all the concerns of what could happen and what could go wrong,"" FEMA chief Craig Fugate told CNN Tuesday. ""We take a different approach. If we don't test it, we don't know what we need to fix."" While some problems became evident in Contra Costa, Hern said the failure was not particularly concerning. The county of 1.1 million people just east of San Francisco has set up a system of sirens, cell phone alerts, Twitter, Facebook and other devices and services to warn citizens about hazards, including releases from area refineries. Like other warning experts, Hern said it is difficult to conceive of an event that would require the president to deliver an emergency warning to the whole country. ""The whole point of a public warning is to tell people that there's a public threat, and (to inform them about) protective action that you take. So if you have an event like 9/11, what are you going to tell people? Not everybody in the entire country is affected in a real physical sense,"" she said. ""How often do you have that one message that applies to everyone in the country?"" Warning systems are of greater value when they are targeted to local communities, she said. But the Emergency Alert System could serve as a ""last ditch 'reassurance' that the government is still up and running,"" noted Richard Rudman, vice chair of the California EAS State Emergency Communications Committee.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Students at a university in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou were given a scare last week, after dozens of snakes invaded the campus. The Guangzhou Daily reported Monday that animal control experts had caught around 40 live snakes on Saturday after a number of the reptiles were spotted writhing along a road in Guangzhou University City. Around 60 snakes were also found dead, most squashed by traffic. ""On the way to the library I saw a green snake lying on the road in the sun, about 50 cm long,"" the newspaper quoted one student as writing on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter. A student from South China Normal University, one of a number of institutions with colleges on the island campus, told her friends to be careful after finding about 60 snakes -- some run over by cars and other lurking in the grass. An official at Sun Yat-Sen University contacted by CNN confirmed that snakes had been found but said they did not know any details. Zhang Liang, from the South China Institute of Endangered Animals, identified the snakes as chequered keelbacks, a common species in the region, and said they were not poisonous. ""This kind of snake likes the sun. It's timid and will not hurt people,"" he said. If they came across a snake, he said that students should call the city's wild animal protection bureau and not poke or try to catch it. Zhang said he suspected that the snakes had been released deliberately. Most of the captured snakes had bite marks on their bodies, suggesting they had been kept in a confined space. The snake invasion was not a signifier of an earthquake or other natural disaster, he cautioned, after students described the incident as an apocalyptic sign.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Once upon a time, in a dark corner of CNN's Atlanta headquarters, there was a messy pile of VHS tapes covered in remnants of packing tape. It was January 2005, shortly after an earthquake had triggered a massive tsunami in the Indian Ocean. CNN, along with many news organizations, had put out a call for footage of the event. With mailing instructions. Like, physical mail. What came back were tapes of all colors and sizes, sent over the course of several weeks, that showed dramatic footage of the event captured by people who had lived through it. For the rest of us, seeing those waves push through entire towns helped us understand how truly enormous and ruinous the tsunami had been and how much help would be needed to overcome it. That's the magic of television storytelling. Images and sound take you right into the heart of events and make it possible to imagine what it must have been like, to sympathize and understand. But the professionals and their cameras are not always there when the story breaks. Hence the box of tsunami tapes in early 2005. Over the next few months, we'd see a parade of breakthrough moments in digital citizen journalism, the beginnings of a new, much faster and more efficient model for collecting and sharing the events that shape our world. There were the dark, blurry cell phone photos from Londoners trapped underground after the July 2005 subway bombings. And the launch of YouTube and the explosion of user-created online video. Then the drama and heartbreak of first-person accounts from many of the people who lived through Hurricane Katrina. Tiny, pocket-sized digital cameras and media-capable cell phones meant the people living through a story could easily tell it and have their voices heard. It was the start of a new world for newsgathering and journalism. iReport was born into that world on August 2, 2006. It started as a very simple webpage that invited news of all stripes to be sent to CNN. Today it's a community of nearly 900,000 people worldwide who share stories and images of the things that matter to them. Very often those stories influence the way CNN approaches the news. For nearly every major news event of the past five years -- from the 2007 shooting on the campus of Virginia Tech to today's uprisings in the Middle East -- iReporters have shared first-person views of the stories they lived through and changed the way the rest of us understood what happened and what we should think about it. More than that, though, iReport has led the way in shaping a model for a news organization to report and tell the story of an event together with its audience. So. This is probably a good place to insert a short history or a bulleted list of things we've learned along the way. But instead, I think I'll tell a handful of stories, all first-person and unapologetically subjective, just like most of my favorite iReports. (If you're reading this story on CNN.com, flip through the photo gallery on top to see the short history.) One: The first day . Honestly, we were a little bored. There were four of us on the iReport desk, all borrowed from other parts of CNN. We'd raced to get everything in order -- a zillion development tests and workflow documents and long meetings in intimidating conference rooms -- but once we flipped the switch, we just had to wait for something to come in. Our upload form had a headline that read ""What's happening where you are?"" The big idea, of course, being that news is open to interpretation. We were hoping our audience would let us know theirs by posting what mattered to them. It was a fairly heavy news day for the middle of the summer: Israel and Lebanon were fighting a war, and it was deadly hot in much of the United States. iReport? Pretty quiet. And then came the squirrel. James Christie was sweltering in Kokomo, Indiana, and spotted what looked like a very hot and exhausted squirrel stretched out on a tree branch. He snapped a photo, posted it to iReport, we called him up and before we knew it, saw it on TV. On CNN! A squirrel! And wouldn't you know, moments after it aired, someone else posted another one. Silly as it was, that photo became one of the first iReport ""assignments"" -- in this case, ""Show us how hot it is where you are"" -- and helped us figure out that there's a lot more to building a community than turning the lights on. Like, giving people ideas about how to join in, and paying off participation. Of course! It's so obvious. But there we were, at the beginning of a giant experiment, starting to figure out how to listen and adapt and keep going while everyone watched. Two: Indecent exposure . Every social media platform has its a-ha story, the one image or piece of footage that cements its status as something that matters. For iReport, it might be Jamal Albarghouti's shocking cell phone video from the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings . It's most certainly not a security camera video of a man in a parking lot urinating in a gas tank then walking away. But, for better or worse, that's the one that made us stop and argue and articulate the ethos of this thing we were building. It was April 2008, not long after we'd launched iReport.com, a full-on website for iReport complete with a new suite of community tools and instant publishing for users. iReporter Eric Bower posted a video that looked like a security camera shot of a parking lot. A man walks on screen, unzips his pants, opens the gas tank on a car and, well ... . He's still there when a group of bike cops pedal by, spot him and proceed to chase him down the street. The video is hilarious and super-watchable, and was already racking up page views and comments without the usual promotional help from CNN. And it's real -- we easily checked the facts by making a few phone calls. But dude. Is this what iReport was all about? Shining light on stupid tricks caught on video? The argument came down to whether we should put it on the CNN.com homepage. Team iReport had recently scored a sweet deal with homepage editors, who agreed to showcase one excellent iReport every day. We were building momentum for a new site, so it was on us to pick something great and clickable that would entice the millions of people who visit CNN.com every day to get on the iReport train. So far we'd highlighted a video of tornado damage in downtown Atlanta, photos of police pushing back riots in Belgrade and footage of a protester hanging a Tibetan flag outside the Chinese embassy in Paris. And then there was the urinating in the gas tank. Would it get people over to iReport? Oh yes. Would they watch and comment and share with their friends? Probably. Would they remember iReport as the place for local news that deserves national attention? Um, yeah, no. After round and round of escalating debate, we put it on the homepage for, like, an hour. We collected some cheap pageviews, thought better of it, pulled it down, and ended up with a much clearer sense of who we were and what we stood for. At the end the day, it's on us to make editorial choices that articulate what we're here for. And that's inviting people in to be part of stories that matter. This one just didn't. Three: Give a little bit . Years later, when a massive earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010, iReport had well established itself as a powerful center for newsgathering and storytelling at CNN. It had put voters at the front of the story of the 2008 U.S. presidential election and was at the heart of the network's coverage of election protests in Iran in 2009. But when the quake struck Haiti, we saw something new. People who had loved ones in Haiti and couldn't reach them started using iReport to post photos of missing people along with pleas for help. It wasn't long before several thousand had stacked up, each one in a slightly different format. A small army of volunteers worked on couches and conference calls for days and nights to organize it all into a cohesive database  that we could share with Google and the Red Cross and try to find people relief or at least answers. CNN started showing the names and images on television and helped create some amazing reunions. I couldn't be prouder of that work and what it means. But what stands out to me most about it today is that what made it possible is that we had in iReport -- both at CNN and in the community at large -- an extraordinarily caring, dedicated and kind group of people who'd learned over the years how to work together to make something much bigger than any of them could do on their own. And at CNN, we'd learned to invite people into our process in real-time, in a spirit of collaboration and exchange and work that needed doing. Four: What's next . This is less a story and more a prediction, or maybe a birthday wish. If we get this right, the future of iReport is in more and deeper collaboration, among one another and also between CNN and the people it serves. Here at iReport and CNN, it started in the way we approached the Haiti database, and you can see it in projects like Katrina: Then and Now and even our walk around the world video. It's certainly the heart of the Open Story approach CNN has used to bring iReporters and CNNers together on stories such as this year's earthquake in Japan and flooding along the Mississippi River. It's about connecting the many voices and expertise and activity that you need to make a story come to life. Happy birthday, iReport. May we all get there together.","CNN's citizen journalism initiative, iReport, is 5 years old .
The first iReport on TV was a hot squirrel .
Since then, iReport has been integral to most major news stories of the past 5 years .
Our prediction for what's next? Collaboration is the future ."

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The U.S. Defense Department on Monday identified the SEAL killed during a successful raid to free a captive doctor in Afghanistan. Petty Officer 1st Class Nicolas D. Checque, 28, of Monroeville, Pennsylvania, died Saturday during the effort to free Dr. Dilip Joseph, the Navy said. NATO commanders believed Joseph was in imminent danger from his captors when the raid took place. While the Defense Department announcement said only that Checque belonged to an ""East Coast-based Special Warfare Unit,"" a U.S. official said the man was a member of the Navy's Special Warfare Development Group, more commonly known as SEAL Team Six. The elite unit is the same one that took part in the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The official didn't know if the SEAL who died was involved in that operation. ""He gave his life for his fellow Americans, and he and his teammates remind us once more of the selfless service that allows our nation to stay strong, safe and free,"" President Barack Obama said of the slain SEAL before his identity was made public. Armed men kidnapped Joseph and two other staff members for the international aid group Morning Star on Wednesday as they returned from a rural medical clinic in eastern Kabul province. Tribal leader Malik Samad and district chief Muhammad Haqbeen told CNN that Joseph and an Afghan doctor were abducted near the village of Jegdalek in the Sarobi district, just outside Kabul. The International Security Assistance Force said Taliban insurgents kidnapped the men. Samad and Haqbeen identified the kidnappers as smugglers. Morning Star said negotiations began ""almost immediately"" with the captors and went on sporadically into Saturday night, when two of the three were released. The Afghan doctor's family paid $12,000 to the smugglers, Haqbeen and Samad said. Morning Star denied paying any ""ransom, money or other consideration"" to win the release of its staffers, and the raid to free Joseph came 11 hours later after the other two were released. U.S. officials provided few details about the rescue effort, but Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said the SEALs ""knew they were putting their lives on the line to free a fellow American from the enemy's grip."" Checque joined the Navy in 2002 after graduating from high school, according to a brief service record provided by the Defense Department. After attending recruit training in Illinois and advanced training in Virginia, he entered the SEAL program in April 2003. He was assigned to his first SEAL unit in August 2004, and transferred to a second unit, presumably SEAL Team Six, in September 2008. He received the Bronze Star and several other awards during his 10-year Naval career. His former high school superiors and classmates at Norwin High School in North Huntington, Pennsylvania, remembered him as diligent and enthused about joining the military. ""He worked hard everyday and never complained,"" his former wrestling coach Rich Ginther told CNN affiliate WPXI. ""I remember his senior year him basically telling us what he was training for, and it was to get in special forces."" The current vice principal, who graduated two classes ahead of Checque, called him a role model for the current students. ""It's scary to hear these kind of stories that come out,"" said Micheal Choby, ""but I'm going to testament to the kind of man Nick built himself to be for these kids who are here aspiring to be in the military."" Former classmate Stefanie Stewart told CNN she sat next to Checque on the school bus almost every day. ""He always knew he wanted to go into the military,"" she said. ""He was a very driven individual, had a very keen sense of mind. A strong-minded person. But underneath that, you could tell he had a good heart."" The rescued doctor has worked with Morning Star for three years. He serves as its medical adviser, and travels frequently to Afghanistan, the agency said. Morning Star did not release the identities of the other two men, citing safety concerns. Joseph is expected to return home to Colorado Springs, Colorado, within a few days, after medical examinations and debriefings, the agency sad. On Sunday, his family extended condolences to the slain sailor's family. ""We are incredibly grateful for the multiple agencies of the U.S. government that have supported us in this difficult time, and especially the quick response by our military and partner allies to rescue Dilip,"" the family said. ""They showed great heroism and professionalism."" Despite the kidnappings of Joseph and its two other staffers, Morning Star reiterated its ""commitment to continue its work"" in Afghanistan.

"(CNN) -- Wow! If you think NFL football is boring, you must not have been watching this weekend. The league's top teams have provided a feast of breathtaking games the past two days. First, on Saturday, the Baltimore Ravens kept retiring linebacker Ray Lewis' career alive by stunning Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos 38-35 in double overtime. After 60 minutes of jaw-dropping kick returns and crazy-close calls, Justin Tucker sealed it with a 47-yard field goal in sudden death. Later that day, young 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick set a rushing record and racked up 400 total yards to humble the vaunted Green Bay Packers defense in a convincing 45-31 win in San Francisco. Then on Sunday, the Seattle Seahawks roared back from a 20-0 halftime deficit against the Falcons and went ahead 28-27 with just 31 seconds left on the clock in Atlanta. The Falcons appeared finished, but Matt Ryan and Tony Gonzalez drove far enough after the ensuing kickoff to give Matt Bryant a shot at a 49-yard field goal with 13 seconds left. Bryant's boot was wide right, but Seattle had called a timeout just before the snap, giving the Falcons a do-over. Bryant didn't miss twice, drilling the long field goal with eight seconds remaining. A Hail Mary pass by sensational Seahawks rookie quarterback Russell Wilson was caught in the end zone -- by sticky-handed Falcons receiver Julio Jones, who was put in on defense for just such an emergency. Finally on Sunday night, Tom Brady and the New England Patriots manhandled the Houston Texans 41-28 in Foxboro, Massachusetts, to capture the final spot in the division championship round next weekend.

"Washington (CNN) -- Thirty to 40 years ago, when arcade and console games were primitive and parents condemned them as a new threat to their children's schooling, it was probably hard to imagine one of America's leading museums embracing video games as an artform. Fast forward to 2012, and many parents are still trying to limit their kids' gaming hours. But video games themselves are increasingly ambitious, interactive and artistically complex -- an evolution celebrated in a new show at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The exhibition, ""The Art of Video Games,"" explores 40 years of video games as cultural artifacts. It features interactive games people can actually play, pieces of gaming memorabilia and visual displays that highlight the artistic work done by developers. And as the first such exhibition to appear in a major museum, it's been a huge hit. Museum officials said their opening last month drew nearly 23,000 people, putting it in the top five highest visitation days ever. Chris Melissinos, guest curator of the exhibition, believes the timing is right because the current generation of museum-goers have grown up with video games. ""The exhibit will highlight the games they grew up with, and in a way, tell the story of their lives,"" he said. ""People will see a game or artwork and remember what they were doing when that game was in their life."" From 'Pac-Man' to 'Flower' Based on the response from the crowds that packed the museum opening weekend, Melissinos may be right. Many visitors seemed thrilled at the chance to relive bits of nostalgia from their youth. ""I thought it was pretty neat to watch the evolution of games,"" said Kim, a woman from Columbus, Ohio, who declined to give her last name. ""I grew up playing 'Frogger' on the Atari but got away from games until my son started playing."" ""We got our first Nintendo when he [son Jimmy] was 6 months old,"" said Barbara of southern Maryland, who also didn't give her full name. ""The old stuff has an artistic feel to it when you look at where games are now. It brings back a lot of memories for me about when my kids were growing up."" ""I thought it was amazing,"" said Jimmy, now 21. ""People will be able to come to the Smithsonian and still learn about video games and see the beauty in them."" The exhibit includes five playable games, from dot-chompin' arcade classic ""Pac-Man"" to 2009's ""Flower,"" a conceptual game in which players spread positive energy by blowing a flower petal through the air. One of its major pieces is a display of 20 different video game consoles throughout the years. From the Atari 2600 to the PlayStation 3, each display features four games that were voted on by fans around the world as the best representatives for that console. Developers' reaction . Most game developers contacted by CNN were excited about being recognized for what they've been doing most of their lives. While the question of ""video games as art"" sparks debate in some circles, game makers agree that raising the level of discussion to include the Smithsonian is a welcome event. ""Uncharted 2: Among Thieves"" was one of the games honored for the PS3 console. Amy Hennig, creative director for the game, said the question of whether video games belong in an art museum is irrelevant. ""Of course they are [art]. It's just another medium. It's just interactive,"" she said. ""To see such a mainstream recognition of our medium, I mean, it really is the first time that that's happened. I think that's a huge cultural event and hugely gratifying."" But the idea that being in the Smithsonian somehow legitimizes the work of the video game industry doesn't sit well with Irrational Games creative director Ken Levine. ""I couldn't care less,"" he said. ""It's nice. It's great to see it at a museum. But, it doesn't mean to me a lot. It doesn't mean anything in terms of a paradigm shift."" Levine said the Smithsonian just adds a new voice to the already burgeoning discussion about games taking place over the Internet in recent years. ""There is probably more conversation about games ... than there was in 500 years of landscape painting,"" he said. He believes the exhibit may raise the level of games in the eyes of people who overlook how important video games are to our culture and society. ""The more places we can talk about what we do, the better,"" Levine said. ""We are a ghettoized industry in the sense that ... we're not on 'The Tonight Show.' Even though guys like 'Call of Duty' are going to sell 25 million copies of their game -- they're not on."" The nature of art . In discussing the exhibition, gamers and developers agree that video games are similar to other forms of art in that they're not complete until experienced by someone. Every person reacts to an artwork differently, lending it meanings that even its creator didn't intend. Given their interactive nature, this may be especially true of video games, Levine said. ""[Art] has no life outside of being viewed. Like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, it changes every time it is viewed. That's what's wonderful about it. It's entirely subjective,"" he said. ""It is, by nature, somebody enforcing their creative will on you. That's what being a viewer is. Part of the joy of experiencing art is surrendering yourself to it. Sometimes, it is a good experience and sometimes, it is not."" The ""Art of Video Games"" exhibition runs through September 30.","A new Smithsonian exhibition explores 40 years of video games as art .

"(CNN) -- Dallas Cowboys nose tackle Josh Brent was arrested on suspicion of intoxication manslaughter after a Mercedes he was driving in Irving, Texas, flipped and caught fire early Saturday morning, killing teammate Jerry Brown Jr., police said. Brent's car was allegedly traveling at a high speed when it hit a curb, according to Irving police, who said officers on the scene ""believed alcohol was a contributing factor in the crash."" The car traveled about 900 feet after hitting the curb, said police spokesman John Argumaniz. When officers came upon the scene, Brent was dragging Brown from the car, he said. The 25-year-old passenger was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Brent, 24, in his third season with the team, was booked into the Irving City Jail on one count of intoxication manslaughter -- considered a second-degree felony that carries a potential two- to 20-year prison sentence with a maximum $10,000 fine. Brent pleaded guilty to a DUI charge in 2009, according to court records in Champaign, Illinois. The records list Brent, who played football with Brown at the University of Illinois, as Joshua Price-Brent, the same name listed in the Irving police report. The athlete got a 60-day sentence, a fine and 200 hours of community service. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Saturday, ""We are deeply saddened by the news of this accident and the passing of Jerry Brown."" ""At this time, our hearts and prayers and deepest sympathies are with the members of Jerry's family and all of those who knew him and loved him,"" he said in a statement. Brown was an outside linebacker on the Dallas practice squad, having been released by the Indianapolis Colts in October. News of Brown's death prompted a flurry of online comments from former classmates and coaches at Illinois. Arrelious Benn tweeted: ""Prayers go out to the family of my former classmate, teammate Former Illini Jerry Brown. RIP. #Illini"" Illinois coach Tim Beckman posted: ""Sad News for the illini family today. Jerry Brown, former illini and current NFL player has passed away. Keep him in your prayers."" The incident occurred shortly after 2 a.m. Saturday, one day before Dallas is scheduled to play the Bengals in Cincinnati. According to the Cowboy's website, Brent has 22 tackles in the 12 games that he's played in this year, starting in five of them. In an effort to keep intoxicated players from taking the wheel, the NFL Players Association runs a ""Safe Rides"" program for $85 per ride, taking it over from the NFL due to confidentiality concerns. CNN's Chandler Friedman and Jason Durand contributed to this report.","Josh Brent was arrested in 2009 on DUI charges .

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- The world needs a ""global New Deal"" to haul it out of the economic crisis it faces, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom said Sunday. Gordon Brown addresses a press conference following a G20 preparatory meeting in Berlin, Sunday. ""We need a global New Deal -- a grand bargain between the countries and continents of this world -- so that the world economy can not only recover but... so the banking system can be based on... best principles,"" he said, referring to the 1930s American plan to fight the Great Depression. Brown was speaking as the leaders of Europe's biggest economies met to try to forge a common position on the global financial crisis ahead of a major summit in London in April. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the world's response to the global financial meltdown had to be profound and long-lasting, not just tinkering around the edges. ""Europe wants to see an overhaul of the system. We all agree on that. We're not talking about superficial measures now or transitional measures -- we're talking about structural measure, which need to be taken,"" he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the host of the meeting, urged nations of the world to work together to fight the problem. ""Confidence can only be restored if people in our countries feel that we are pulling in the same direction and have understood that we really must learn lessons from this crisis,"" she said. And she proposed that a new institution grow out of the crisis, ""which will take on more responsibility for global [financial] mechanisms."" The Europeans say they have agreed international financial markets must be regulated more thoroughly. That also means stricter rules for hedge funds and credit-rating agencies. European and world leaders have been holding frequent summits as they struggle to cope with a financial crisis that has affected banks, homeowners, businesses and employees around the world. London will host a meeting of the Group of 20 nations in April. The G-20 includes the G-7 leading industrialized nations -- Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States -- as well as the world's largest developing economies: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey, plus the European Union. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund and the president of the World Bank, plus the chairs of the International Monetary and Financial Committee and Development Committee of the IMF and World Bank, also participate in G-20 meetings.

"(CNN) -- At a time of heightened tensions in the Middle East, the U.S. Navy has been forced to temporarily abandon the requirement to keep two aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf because of unusual maintenance problems. The USS Nimitz was expected to deploy to the Persian Gulf early next year, but it will not leave because of extensive repairs on a failed propulsion pump. It may be deployed in spring 2013. At the same time, the USS Eisenhower is being sent home immediately for repairs to its flight deck. It will remain in Norfolk, Virginia, for two months and then return to the Middle East early next year to complete its deployment. The Navy plans to send the USS Harry S Truman to the region early next year to restore the two-carrier presence. The USS John C. Stennis is already in the area.

"(CNN) -- Dads in short shorts and moms in beehive hairdos are becoming all the rage on the Internet. Parents are usually the first to show off pictures of their kids, but that role has been reversed in a new breed of style blogs in which children submit nostalgic and stylish photos of their parents from back in the day. Blogs like My Mom, the Style Icon, My Parents Were Awesome  and Dads in Short Shorts allow proud children to submit nostalgic pictures of their parents to put on display for the world. ""Similar to the way that young people look to celebrities as style icons, more people are looking to these attainable vintage fashions from their parents and there is a growing population of people who prefer these classic looks,"" said Margot Nason, editor of the trend forecasting newsletter Trend Central. What is so unique about these blogs is that the photos celebrate just how cool today's offspring think their parents are. Rather than laughing or cringing at old photos of their folks, today's children want everyone to see their parents in their heyday. Newspaper editor Piper Weiss got the idea for My Mom, the Style Icon when she was rifling through her mother's closet in search of vintage clothes to steal for her own wardrobe. ""I began using pictures of her before I was born as a guide to my own style because I figured whatever looked good on her when she was young would look good on me now,"" said Weiss, 31. ""I discovered a photo album of pictures of her before she met my dad and she was so heart-stoppingly gorgeous I wanted to share them with everyone I knew. I started the blog with pictures of my mom and then people's own submissions started rolling in."" Since the Web site has been live for a little more than a month, Weiss has received several hundred submissions of parent pictures from folks who want to memorialize their mom and dad's most stylish years on the Internet. During a recession, folks are more likely to indulge in the kind of nostalgia these old pictures evoke. ""Times of uncertainty make you long for the past, and the nostalgia of these pictures makes people feel safe,"" said Samantha Marcus Yanks, editor-in-chief of Gotham and Hamptons magazines. ""And a bit of nostalgia is inspirational in fashion these days, because it seems more affordable."" The Web site Dads in Short Shorts, started by marketing manager Tara Eisenberg, 26, and painter Annie Kyle, 26, has a genesis similar to My Mom, the Style Icon. ""On a summer road trip we were looking through an old photo album and discovered a shot of a dad in bright yellow shorts mixed in with seemingly normal family photos,"" Eisenberg said. ""The mom claimed the shot was an 'accident' and that she was just 'testing the camera.' Upon further investigation, we noticed a lot of our friends had similar 'accidents' in their old photo albums, and thus the blog was born."" Dads in Short Shorts has had more the 50 submissions of dads wearing above the knee pants, with more pouring in every day. How do parents feel about being exposed in all their youthful glory and occasional fashion disasters on the Internet for all to see? ""The blog is great fun for me and the nostalgia is a trip,"" said Marilyn Weiss about her debut on My Mom, the Style Icon. ""Not many guests want to sit down and see your old photos. They want to show you theirs. ""Fortunately for this mom, my daughter has provided me with quite an extensive and diverse audience."" Samantha Josephs, whose mom, Susan Buckner, played Patty Simcox in the movie version of ""Grease,"" was inspired to send a picture of her mom from the '70s when she was touring with Dean Martin and the Golddiggers. ""The photos that I've collected from her from all of the girls in the group were always my favorite because of the platinum big hair and the kitten eyes,"" Josephs said. ""My mother looks iconic in the photo, and I still look at her the same when I see her now."" Buckner was certainly a style icon in her own right in the '70s, but being made one in the Internet age held a whole new meaning. ""My mom screamed when she saw it. She thanked me a thousand times over, made it her screen saver and said what an amazing gift this was to her to be made an icon on the Internet,"" Josephs said.","Some ""kids"" are proud of how stylish their parents were years ago .

"(CNN) -- A manufacturer of a popular cholesterol-reducing medication has recalled more than 40 batches of the product after warning that they may contain small particles of glass. Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc. says it is calling back bottles of its 10-, 20- and 40-milligram tablets of atorvastatin calcium, the generic version of the widely prescribed anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor. A total of 41 lots of 90- and 500-count bottles are subject to the recall, the company said. ""The recall is being conducted at the retail level for such select batches that may contain a foreign substance (small glass particles approximately less than 1mm in size),"" Ranbaxy's U.S. subsidiary said in a statement on its website. ""Ranbaxy is proactively recalling the drug product lots out of an abundance of caution, and in keeping the safety of our customers in mind."" A full list of the recalled lots can be found at http://ranbaxyusa.com/images/a.pdf . Ranbaxy said its action was taken ""with the full knowledge"" of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which granted the company its approval to manufacture the drug at a plant in New Jersey in 2011. India-based Ranbaxy came under fire from FDA officials over conditions at two Indian plants in 2006 and 2008. That led to a January 2012 agreement with the Justice Department that cited the company for submitting false data to the FDA and barred the company from manufacturing drugs for the American market at those facilities until they could meet U.S. standards.","Drug maker Ranbaxy says it's calling back 41 lots of the popular statin .

"(CNN) -- A panel of Australian citizens is expected to set the tone Thursday for a planned constitutional referendum to better recognize the indigenous population that inhabited the vast continent long before Europeans settled there. The diverse group includes Aboriginal leaders, business executives, legal experts and members of the main political parties. It spent the past year crisscrossing Australia to gather opinions in order to provide recommendations to the government. ""At the moment, the Constitution denies that there was a prior presence of Aboriginal people in Australia,"" said Mark McKenna, an associate professor of history at the University of Sydney. ""They're pretty much invisible."" The panel faces a daunting task -- changes by referendum rarely do well in Australia. Only eight of the 44 referendum proposals have passed in the country's history, with the last successful one in 1974. ""This is a rare, once in a lifetime opportunity if the federal government proceeds to referendum,"" Megan Davis, director of the Indigenous Law Center at the University of New South Wales and an expert member of the panel said in an e-mail. Though it appears political parties support a change in the Constitution, they differ on the details. Prime Minister Julia Gillard's Labour government has said it is committed to holding a referendum on the subject during its current term or at the next general election. And the opposition Liberal Party has also voiced support for the measure. Politicians generally agree the existing wording of the Constitution could be improved. ""It's bringing the Constitution into line with what everyone has pretty much accepted now,"" said McKenna, noting a key Australian High Court decision over land rights in 1992 that rejected the notion that Australia was ""terra nullius,"" or ""empty land"" before the arrival of European settlers. In 2008, then-prime minister, Kevin Rudd, apologized for the state's mistreatment of indigenous people in the past, describing it as a ""blemished chapter in our nation's history."" But the Constitution is yet to clearly reflect that, with the original document, which dates to 1901, a product of its time. It took a narrow, 19th-century view of who is defined as a citizen with full rights and gave little thought to Aborigines. The Australian stance was similar to that of other nations such as the United States and South Africa. ""At that time, it was thought that the Aboriginal people would die out,"" McKenna said. The indigenous population declined to about 93,000 in 1901, from between 300,000 and 750,000 in 1788. But the population subsequently recovered. In the 2006 Census, 455,031 people identified themselves as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent out of a total national population of more than 21 million. A step toward updating the Constitution was made in 1967, when more than 90% of voters approved the removal of two references to Aboriginal people that were deemed negative. Many people feel, however, that the 1967 referendum left some unfinished business. While their numbers have increased, indigenous people have struggled to keep pace with the economic gains of the broader Australian population. ""On all the major indicators -- be they economic, social, health or education -- Aboriginal people are way behind,"" McKenna said. The panel apparently intends to improve the constitutional standing. ""The prime minister will be told that the Constitution needs to be changed and that this is backed by a majority of Australians,"" George Williams, a professor of law at the University of New South Wales and a member of the panel, wrote in an opinion article published Tuesday in The Sydney Morning Herald, a daily newspaper. There are two provisions that are still considered to have racist connotations: one that allows states to disqualify people of ""all persons of any race"" from voting at elections; and another that authorizes parliament to make ""special laws"" for ""the people of any race."" The panel is expected to recommend that removal of those two provisions, a move likely to receive broad political support. The delicate issue will be how to go about inserting a positive recognition of indigenous people's status into the document. Some commentators and politicians fear that any new provision in the Constitution that actively asserts indigenous Australians' rights to advancement could result in too much power for the courts. ""Any proposal to include in the Constitution a measure that might open the door to endless litigation and judicial second-guessing of parliamentary decisions about what policies best secure the ""advancement"" of Aborigines, is not only undesirable in itself, it would surely spell the defeat of the referendum,"" George Brandis, a senior official who deals with the Liberal Party legal issues, wrote in an opinion piece last month for The Australian, a national newspaper. But if the proposed changes are too slight, they may disappoint Aboriginal leaders and other advocates of more significant measures. ""Positive words and symbolic change will not be enough,"" Williams said in the Sydney Morning Herald. All sides recognize, though, that a lack of bipartisan support will prevent the referendum from succeeding. Even if the process results in a change that is more symbolic than legally binding, it may still have positive consequences. ""Recognition of Indigenous Australians as the first people of Australia is a critical step to support the improvement of Indigenous mental health,"" the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists wrote in its submission to the panel. ""The lack of acknowledgment of a people's existence in a country's Constitution has a major impact on their sense of identity, value within the community and perpetuates discrimination and prejudice which further erodes the hope of Indigenous people,"" the college said.","The diverse group includes Aboriginal leaders and business executives .

"(CNN) -- Washington appears to be run by screenwriters, where the rule is to get as close to the cliff as possible. Drive off, if it won't be too unbelievable. Then -- like young James T. Kirk in the J.J. Abrams reboot of Star Trek -- jump out as the car plunges to the bottom and climb your way back up. That's great Hollywood -- and perhaps the best-case scenario in Washington as lawmakers drive toward the fiscal cliff. There's an upside too. If you watch the news closely, you'll see our Washington leaders making the classic mistakes that bad negotiators make. You'll see when they should be changing direction, doing B instead of A. And you'll be improving your own negotiation skills along the way. I'm totally serious here: As you watch, notice what they should be doing, instead of what they are doing, and it's likely that you'll act more effectively when you have to negotiate a new house, a big sale, or a pay increase to cover the increase in your taxes if lawmakers drive over the edge. Over the past 20 years, I've helped organizations of all kinds negotiate the sale of companies, contracts for C-suite executives, and union-management agreements. I've also taught negotiation techniques to members of law enforcement -- many SWAT teams and their federal counterparts. Here's what I can tell you: Negotiation has three steps and three rules. Let's look at what should be happening in Washington. Step 1.  Say what you want and ask the people on other side what they want.  What results is ""positions"" -- what each side says it wants. You tell the car dealer that you'd like $5,000 more for your trade-in than you really think you can get. It's not what you expect, but it's a way to start the negotiation. Opinion: Beware the fiscal cliff deniers . The first serious set of positions came out from Republicans on December 3. The Democrats got there a bit sooner. This step should have been over a couple of days after the election. Step 2: One side steps up and asks why the other's position is what it is, and keeps asking ""why"" until it gets to core values. Don't laugh, but in the real world it works like this: Democrats to Republicans: ""How come 'no tax increases' is so vital for you?"" Republicans to Democrats: ""Why is it so important to raise taxes on households making over $250,000?"" These questions ""surface"" each side's interests, the reasons behind the positions, as William Ury, Roger Fisher and Bruce Patton note in their classic ""Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In."" I once worked in a hospital where the nurses insisted on a large percentage increase in their pay. Stuck at step one, they'd repeat what they wanted, and the hospital executives would call them greedy and out of touch, often with the press listening. The nurses responded that the hospital was run by greedy trolls who only cared about making money. Things moved forward when someone asked the nurses why that position was so important. ""It's about fairness,"" they said. When the nurses were asked why fairness is so important, they said ""respect."" They felt disrespected by the process, the various offers, and being kept out of hospital decision-making. When they settled, a part of the deal was -- are you sitting down? -- that they wanted to put in more time, invest more passion and expertise, and have a greater sense of ownership in the hospital. Opinion: Millionaires' tax bracket would be a smart compromise . By the hospital giving them a fair slice of its financial success, through a sort of profit-sharing deal, the nurses did better than they would have done with just the straight percentage increase. And they won -- emotionally and financially. People will surrender a position if it helps them achieve what they're really after. The hospital executives went through a similar process. Their position was that the nurses would get no increase. Why zero? ""Market realities"" -- salary surveys showing that they were already paid fairly. Why were market realities important? Because the executives wanted the hospital to be the best in its market, in all respects. The core value for the executives was ""best of the best."" Notice the Hollywood ending that results: The executives and nurses both got more than they originally wanted, and both were invested in making it happen. Research my colleagues and I published found that groups get far better results when decisions are based on values rather than compromise or interests alone. Step 3: Build a specific plan based on the core values. Compromise only when core values pull in opposite directions. I'm not talking a grand bargain here, just an agreement that honors the core values of each side. I've seen groups go through this process in an hour, even when the difficulties were more complicated than those facing Washington. Here's the question to address: How do we put together a plan that honors opportunity, growth, fairness, and responsibility? The plan will have lots of pieces, but lawmakers could get to the skeleton of the plan in half a day. President Obama said a week. I'm not sure we'll have a week by the time people decide to do their jobs. Opinion: How Obama can win a deal . In Washington, what we need is a band of leaders to take the key clamoring politicians off site, without cameras or press conferences. Camp David was meant for such occasions. Or to keep costs down, how about a conference room at a Motel 6? Once there, they also need to make sure they are honoring the three rules of negotiations: . Never go in with your hands tied.  Many Republicans signed Grover Norquist's no-tax-hike pledge. This puts them in a lose-lose position, and a few are expressing that realization. Without the ability to negotiate freely, their Democratic counterparts know Republicans are hampered. The cure: Have every Republican revoke his or her pledge, as a few have already done. They may still vote for a no-tax deal, but they can't negotiate in good faith with that pledge over their heads. Think of a marriage in crisis. The best way to save the situation is to put everything on the table -- including possible divorce -- and then go through the steps I outlined here. Only by setting their positions down, and moving to the deeper levels, can the people have their best shot at a great outcome. Ironically, the more you hold to a position, the less likely you are to get it. Don't go straight for a compromise. The Democrats get a flag on field here. The tone is: ""The election is over, now let's meet in the middle -- you get some of what you want, and we get some of what we want."" Wrong, dead wrong. Go through the process. Don't confuse positions with core values. The Republicans get the penalty flag here. ""No new taxes"" is a position, not a core value. People should never compromise on their core values, but they should be prepared to let go of their positions. Likewise, for Democrats, ""go back to the pre-Bush tax rates for the wealthy"" is a position, not a core value. The core values are far more interesting: growth, opportunity, fairness, and responsibility. Imagine a bill, signed by the president, that honored those principles, instead of merely cobbling together the demands of both parties. Everyone wins, and the lawmakers would truly be leaders. Get out the popcorn and let's see how close to this fiscal cliff we get. With these principles in mind, you will leave the drama with better skills to negotiate your future. Really, this isn't that hard. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dave Logan.","Dave Logan: Fiscal cliff negotiations have the cooked-up suspense of a Hollywood movie .
Watch closely if you want to see how not to make a deal; real negotiation has rules, he says .
He says both sides should state positions, then reveal ""core values"" and build deal from there .

"Cairo (CNN) -- The Arab League agreed on a path forward in Syria on Sunday that instructs President Bashar al-Assad to delegate powers to his vice president following the formation of a national unity government. The Syrian government roundly rejected the plan, which it views as ""blatant intervention in its internal affairs,"" Syria's official SANA news agency reported soon after the announcement. The Arab League called for the government to start a dialogue with the opposition within two weeks and for the new government to be formed within two months. The unity government should within three months prepare to elect a council that will write a constitution, the Arab League said. It should also prepare for parliamentary and presidential elections. The plan, details of which were announced by Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani at a press conference in Cairo, is the clearest statement yet from the Arab League on what the league's member states would like to see happen in Syria. It remains unclear what weight, if any, the proposal will carry on the ground. ""The president will delegate his first vice president the full power to work with the national unity government to enable it to perform its task in the transitional period,"" the foreign minister said. The Arab League will take its initiative, which does not back military intervention in Syria, to the United Nations in a bid to build international support. The organization also said it would extend its monitoring mission in Syria and increase the number of observers there. The mission was scheduled to end last Thursday. It was not clear whether Syrian officials would accept the offer. Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby said the Syrian government has not complied with some parts of an Arab League agreement aimed at ending a violent crackdown on protesters. Syrian officials are treating the crisis as a security problem, he said, noting that armed opposition factions controlling some areas made it difficult for observers to do their jobs. But Arab League monitors have seen some aspects of the situation improve, he said. ""The presence of the Arab monitors provided security to opposition parties, which held an increase in number of peaceful protests ... in the areas where the monitors were present,"" el-Araby said. Before el-Araby's statement, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said his nation planned to withdraw its members of the observer team, according to an Arab League official. Prince Saud al-Faisal told Arab League foreign ministers that ""Syria did not comply with the Arab resolution plan,"" according to the Arab League official, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Earlier Sunday, a five-nation committee led by Qatar requested a one-month extension of the mission from the foreign ministers of the league's 22 member states. The committee made its request after reviewing a report submitted by Sudanese Lt. Gen. Mohammad Ahmad al-Dabi, head of the league's monitoring mission in Syria. Before leaving Damascus for the meeting in Cairo, al-Dabi said the mission of the monitoring group is ""not to stop the killing and violence in Syria but to investigate the Syrian government's execution of the article of the Arab plan aimed at solving the Syrian crisis."" The Arab League has called on President al-Assad's regime to stop violence against civilians, free political detainees, remove tanks and weapons from cities and allow outsiders, including the international news media, to travel freely in Syria. Senior Arab League diplomats said the Syrian government has not accepted or rejected the possibility of a one-month extension. Some worry the observers haven't been allowed to see the full situation in Syria. ""The Arab monitors indicated that the regime did not follow protocol, did not release the detainees, did not remove all military tanks, did not allow press to travel freely, did not recognize even once the peaceful protests, and the massacre of Idlib yesterday is proof of that. The regime let down the Arab League, and Arab nations have the responsibility to respond,"" said Burhan Ghalioun, head of the opposition Syrian National Council. He spoke to reporters in Cairo following the Arab League announcement, calling for the protection of civilians in Syria, describing U.N. cooperation as vital and stressing the need for Al-Assad to resign. ""Any serious entrance of an interim period must start with al-Assad announcing his stepping down,"" he said. The presence of Arab League monitors in the country hasn't quelled daily reports of deadly violence. At least 59 people were found dead across Syria on Saturday, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition activist group. They include 30 unidentified corpses found at the National Hospital in Idlib and at least 16 dead from a bus explosion in northwestern Syria's Idlib province. CNN cannot confirm the claims by opposition groups of violence and deaths, as Syria's government has limited access by foreign journalists. For more than 10 months, Syria has been engulfed by an anti-government public uprising and a brutal security crackdown against protesters. The United Nations last month estimated well over 5,000 deaths since mid-March. Opposition groups estimate more than 6,000 people have died. While activists blame the violence on al-Assad's regime, the government says terrorists have been responsible for the bloodshed. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Joe Sterling and Samira Said contributed to this report.","NEW: The Syrian government rejects the proposal, SANA reports .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is recovering after facing complications during cancer surgery this week, officials said. ""This process of recuperation ... will require a prudent time, as a result of the complexity of the surgical procedure, and also because of complications that came up in the surgery, when bleeding presented itself, requiring the adoption of corrective measures to permit its proper control,"" Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said in a televised address Thursday afternoon. Vice President Nicolas Maduro said doctors had acted quickly to control the unexpected bleeding. Speaking at a rally in northern Venezuela on Thursday evening, Maduro said Chavez's recuperation had ""evolved from stable to favorable"" but did not provide details about his long-term prognosis. The news drew cheers and thunderous applause from those at the rally, which marked the end of campaigning for Sunday's regional elections. Officials: Chavez faces 'difficult' recovery . Chavez, who first announced he was battling cancer in June 2011, underwent surgery Tuesday in Cuba. He has not disclosed what type of cancer he has, and the Venezuelan government has released few details about Chavez's illness, fueling widespread speculation about his health and political future. On Wednesday, the officials struck a more somber tone when discussing Chavez's treatment. The information minister suggested Chavez might not be not be back in Venezuela in time for his scheduled inauguration, which is a month away. Venezuelans ""should be prepared to understand"" if Chavez doesn't return to Venezuela before the inauguration on January 10, Villegas said. ""It would be irresponsible to hide the delicacy of the current moment and the coming days,"" he wrote in a post on the information ministry's website. The title of his post -- ""Chavez Will Live and Overcome"" -- was similar to many official announcements since Chavez's illness was announced last year. But the message's tone was markedly different from previous ones. ""The president is a human being,"" Villegas said. ""He underwent a difficult, complex, delicate operation. And now he is in post-operation, which is also difficult, complex and delicate."" Maduro said Wednesday that Chavez would face a ""complex and difficult"" recovery after the six-hour surgery. His voice cracked as he asked Venezuelans to remain united and pray for Chavez. On Thursday, the vice president said some had criticized him for delivering the news with such a somber expression. ""Our faces are expressions of pain and worry and the most pure love that we feel for our Commander Hugo Chavez,"" he said. ""He gave us the order to prepare the people for any circumstance. And we have followed that to the letter."" Chavez has undergone several surgeries and radiation treatment in Cuba in the past year and a half. Read more: Venezuela's Hugo Chavez emerges from 6 hours of surgery . Health rumors dogged Chavez on the campaign trail this year but didn't stop him from winning re-election in October. Over the weekend, as he prepared for the latest operation, Chavez said he wanted Maduro to replace him if ""something were to happen that would incapacitate me."" It was the first time since his diagnosis that Chavez had specified a successor. Neither Cuban nor Venezuelan authorities have disclosed where Chavez is being treated. The government in Havana has remained tight-lipped about the treatment of their close ally, who sends Cuba millions of barrels of oil at deeply discounted prices. Many Cubans are worried that Chavez's illness could mean an end to those generous subsidies. The island's economy never fully recovered after the Soviet Union cut their huge aid package following the fall of the Berlin Wall. On Tuesday, panelists at a discussion about a new documentary on Chavez in Havana touched upon the leader's ill health. Venezuela's military attache to Cuba appeared to tear up as he discussed Chavez's cancer. ""My commander in chief has been the man to take on problems,"" Col. Eldan Rafael Dominguez Fortty said. ""We have overcome every obstacle, and now with this battle to survive, he will figure that out, too."" CNN's Patrick Oppmann reported from Havana, Cuba. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.","Venezuela's vice president says President Hugo Chavez's recuperation is going favorably .

"(CNN) -- Pop star Britney Spears and former manager Jason Trawick have ended their yearlong engagement, a representative for the singer said Friday. The decision was mutual, according to the couple. ""I'll always adore him and we will remain great friends,"" Spears, 31, said in a statement. In his own statement, the 41-year-old Trawick said the split marks a new chapter for the couple. ""I love and cherish her and her boys and we will be close forever,"" he said, referring to Spears' two sons with former husband Kevin Federline. Spears and Trawick, who had been dating since 2009, became engaged in December 2011. It would have been the third trip down the aisle for Spears. In 2004, she had a quickie Las Vegas wedding with childhood friend Jason Alexander (the ""marriage"" lasted 55 hours). Later that year, she married Federline; they divorced in 2006. News of the split comes as Spears announced she will not be returning as a judge on Fox's ""X Factor."" ""I had an incredible time doing the show and I love the other judges and I am so proud of my teens but it's time for me to get back in the studio,"" she said in a statement Friday. Spears' latest album, ""Femme Fatale,"" came out in 2011. Meanwhile, a source close to the singer tells CNN she is in ""serious talks"" to perform in Las Vegas as part of a long-term residency.

"(CNN) -- The gun lobby is ""ginning up"" fears the federal government will use the Newtown shooting tragedy, exactly one month ago, to seize Americans' guns, President Barack Obama said Monday. At least part of the frenzy is little more than marketing, he implied. ""It's certainly good for business,"" the president said, responding to a question about a spike in weapons sales and applications for background checks after the massacre at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School left 27 people dead, 20 of them children. ""Part of the challenge we confront is that even the slightest hint of some sensible, responsible legislation in this area fans this notion that somehow, 'Here it comes, everybody's guns are going to be taken away,'"" Obama said. Read more: Newtown searches for answers a month later . This week, the president is reviewing recommendations from a task force led by Vice President Joe Biden looking into ways to curb gun violence. Obama set up the group after December's carnage in Newtown and demanded reform ideas by this month. Obama said he expects to have a fuller presentation later in the week ""to give people some specifics about what I think we need to do,"" he told reporters Monday. While the final recommendations have not been made public, Biden has said he's found widespread support for universal background checks and restrictions on the sale of high capacity magazines, which gun-control advocates believe contribute to more bloodshed at mass shootings. Obama said he backs such measures as well as renewing the Clinton-era assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. Passing any legislation may not be easy: The influential National Rifle Association, among other gun rights groups, has vowed to fight any new gun restrictions -- like an assault weapon ban, which the group's president David Keene predicted Sunday wouldn't make it through Congress -- tooth and nail. Yet, as he weighs options, Obama said politics isn't his first concern. ""My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works, what should we be doing to make sure our children are safe,"" he told reporters. ""I think we can do that in a sensible way that comports with the Second Amendment."" 'This is about the safety of the public' Gun control advocates, gun violence victims, the NRA, video game makers and others have met with the Biden-led task force, with their conversations ranging from the capacity of ammunition magazines to portrayals of violence in the media. The vice president met Monday with congressional Democrats, talks that are ""part of a larger outreach effort that will involve other members of Congress,"" a source familiar with the meeting told CNN. In addition to new gun restrictions, the package proposed by Obama may include mental health provisions that could garner wider support. Some initiatives -- like how the government tracks how weapons fall into criminals' hands -- could be accomplished by executive order, Obama said. Yet other measures would require approval of a Congress that, on many issues, has been hard-pressed to get anything accomplished -- even though the momentum to act in some way, be it by clamping down on guns or putting armed guards in schools, as the NRA has proposed -- is undeniable. Mark Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut whose wife, then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, survived a 2011 mass shooting that left six dead, said he and his wife both own guns and support the Second Amendment. Yet the couple is adamant that more must be done to curb gun violence, touting measures like banning high-capacity magazines and having universal background checks, which Kelly said a vast majority of the NRA's 4.2 million members support. Decisive action or imagery: Gun control and the power of political symbolism . ""This isn't really about the Second Amendment,"" said Kelly, who has formed a political action committee intent on pursuing reforms. ""This is about gun safety, and it's about the safety of the public."" The retired Navy captain told CNN he believes the debate can produce ""common sense solutions to this very serious problem."" People around the country are demanding nothing less in the wake of the Newtown shooting, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. He said Monday that more than 1 million people have signed a petition backed by his group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns. ""For many Americans, this is the straw that broke the camel's back,"" he said about the Connecticut school carnage. Polling appears to support the contention. Poll shows public dissatisfied with gun laws . A new Gallup poll released Monday shows 38% of Americans are dissatisfied with current gun laws and support stricter proposals. That is a 13 percentage point jump from a year ago. The shift is most marked among men. The poll revealed a 17 percent increase in support for stricter gun control laws among men, compared to 10 percentage points for women. That may be because polling has shown women already tend to be more supportive of gun control legislation. The increase spanned the partisan divide, but it was strongest with Democrats, 64 percent of whom said they favor additional regulations. That's up 22 percentage points from last year, Gallup reported. Among Republicans, support rose by 12 percentage points, though that still only works out to 18 percent overall. The poll of 1,011 adults was conducted January 7-10 and has a sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. Universal background check: What does it mean? New gun violence proposal in Maryland . Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy wrote Biden, and told CNN, that federal gun control action is imperative, noting there's little to stop would-be criminals from taking advantage of relatively lax laws in one state and transporting guns around the country. While this view is widely shared among gun control supporters, that hasn't stopped some of them from taking actions on the state level. Speaking at a Johns Hopkins University summit on reducing gun violence attended by Bloomberg, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said he will debut gun control proposals this week that would ban military style assault weapons and limit the size of magazines and introduce a ""common-sense licensing requirement for handguns that respects the traditions of hunters and sportsmen."" The proposals would also include mental health reforms, O'Malley said. Those include additional funds for treatment and efforts to detect and head off serious mental illness sooner. The plan also calls for investments in school safety, including a center to study ways to improve security at schools. He said the issue isn't a partisan one, but rather a public health issue, and said it ""makes no sense to blame every factor but guns."" ""There may be no way to completely prevent the next Newtown tragedy,"" he said. ""But again, perhaps there is."" New York Senate passes new gun regulations . In New York -- where a week ago, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo spelled out tough new gun control proposals -- the state Senate passed a series of new gun regulations in a 43-18 vote Monday night. The bill now goes to the state Assembly. Cuomo called for an assault weapons ban, background checks for people who purchase guns in private transactions and a ban on high-capacity magazines. The tentative deal would include a statewide assault weapons registry and add a uniform licensing standard across the state -- altering the current system, in which each county or municipality sets a standard -- a state Senate source said Monday. Magazines could have no more than seven bullets under the would-be agreement, according to the source, among other provisions. Discussions had percolated about crafting a law, similar to one in California, that allows mental health professionals to inform law enforcement if they believe their patient could pose a threat to themselves or others, the source said. Law enforcement authorities may then revoke the patient's license to carry a firearm and prevent them from having a gun for at least six months. One month since shooting . Meanwhile, bitter memories of the tragedy that spurred such proposals remains raw, especially in western Connecticut. The one-month anniversary of the shooting went largely unmarked in any formal way, save for a moment of silence at a news conference held by a community group, ""Sandy Hook Promise,"" formed after the killings to find a solution to gun violence. Nicole Hockley, whose son Dylan was among the children killed in the shooting, was among several parents who spoke. ""I still find myself reaching for Dylan's hand to walk through a car parking lot, or expecting him to crawl into bed beside me for early morning cuddles before we get ready for school,"" she said, her voice quavering. ""It is so hard to believe he is gone."" Others spoke of their resolve to ensure such violence ends. ""We refuse to be remembered only for our loss,"" group co-founder Tom Bittman said. ""We want the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings to be recalled as the turning point when we brought our community, and communities across the nation, together and set a real course for change."" Newtown opens eyes to other gun violence against young people .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Young fashion designer Ali Khan made his debut at New York Fashion Week with male models strutting down the runway in his avant-garde menswear designs. One of Ali Khan's designs: black and white baseball jacket, white cotton shirt and gray cotton-blend pants. But Khan wasn't behind the scenes to enjoy the show, because U.S. officials wouldn't let him into the country. ""It's really disappointing to not be able to be there with my classmates, but even if I can't be there, I'm still so excited my collection is showing on the New York runways,"" Khan said. Khan created his runway high fashion not from one of the fashion capitals of the world but from his home in Lahore, Pakistan. The young designer describes his spring collection as a mixture of classic elements with a newer silhouette. It is versatile and can be worn easily from day to night. Khan studied fashion design in online classes from San Francisco, California's Academy of Art University School of Fashion. ""Ali is a star here at the Academy and possesses superb talent,"" said Ian MacKintosh, spokesman for Academy of Art University. A few outstanding new graduates are chosen to present their thesis collections every year at glamorous Fashion Week. For young designers, this is a chance to showcase their creations at a potentially career-launching venue. Khan was notified in June that he'd made the final cut and that his collection was going to fashion week. ""I was out of this world excited when I found out. You can't even dream of something like that,"" Khan said. ""I have wanted this ever since I was a kid!"" The Internet made it possible for Khan to study at Academy of Art University, which in addition to a regular classroom environment provides Internet classes through video and audio links for students who are unable to attend the university in person. Some classes are ""live"" one-on-one conferences between professor and student, and others are pre-taped lessons with a professor. Videos and photos of the students' work, demonstrating technique, stitching, fabric choices and sketches, are all sent to the teacher via Internet and are critiqued for grades. Of the 1,800 Academy students, 25 were selected by the committee, and of those, only 15 students were finally chosen to show their collections at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Spring 2009. Khan was among those chosen and immediately applied for his travel visa, but the Pakistan and U.S. governments declined his request. He was not given a reason. He had to ship his entire final menswear collection to the Academy's Committee. That menswear collection was shown Friday, the opening day of the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week. Khan has begun work on his next collection and is in the process of launching his own label in Doha, Qatar.","Young designer Ali Khan had a runway show at NYC Fashion Week .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea became the first defending champion to crash out at the Group Stage of the Champions League -- despite thrashing Danish side Nordsjaelland 6-1 at Stamford Bridge. The win was Chelsea's largest in the competition, but it still wasn't enough to prevent them slipping into the Europa League. Rafa Benitez's side needed Shakhtar Donetsk to do them a favor and defeat Juventus, but the Italian team triumphed 1-0 in Ukraine. That meant that Chelsea's victory was meaningless, despite the margin of victory. It looked as if the Blues would endure a difficult evening when Nordsjaelland was awarded a penalty on 32 minutes. But Chelsea keeper Petr Cech saved well from Nicolai Stokholm to keep the game goalless. Just minutes later, it was Chelsea's turn to miss from the spot when Eden Hazard's effort was saved. Chelsea collapse heaps pressure on Benitez . Any frustration around Stamford Bridge was finally extinguished when the home side was awarded another penalty following a handball and David Luiz swept home. Fernando Torres netted a second on the stroke of halftime before Nordsjaelland halved the deficit through Joshua John. But the Blues steamrolled the Danes in the second period with Torres grabbing his second, before Hazard, Juan Mata and Oscar completed the rout. In the end, it was Olexander Kucher's 56th minute own goal in Ukraine which sealed Chelsea's demise and Juventus' place in the knockout phase. Both Shakhtar and Juve only needed a draw to progress with the Ukrainian side already guaranteed of a place in the last-16. But the Italians secured victory and top spot with a hard-fought win. Barca's unbeaten run ended by Celtic . In Glasgow, Celtic secured a dramatic 2-1 win over Spartak Moscow to secure second place in Group G. Kris Commons netted an 81st minute penalty to seal the three points and ensure the Scottish champion leapfrogged Benfica. Gary Hooper's strike had given Celtic the lead before Spartak struck back through Ari six minutes before the break. But when Marek Suchý was adjuged to have brought down Giorgos Samaras, Commons blasted the ball home from 12-yards to spark wild celebrations. Spartak's misery was compounded when Kim Kallstrom was sent off for a wild tackle on Commons. Benfica and 'the curse of Bela Guttmann' Meanwhile, Benfica was left to think of what might have been after finishing goalless at Barcelona. The Catalan side left out a whole host of star names including Xavi and Andres Iniesta, while Leo Messi started on the bench. Messi map: How Argentine maestro conquered the world . Messi, who still needs two goals to beat Gerd Muller's record of 85 goals in a calendar year, did come onto the field after 58 minutes, but was forced off on a stretcher after suffering an injury late on. But despite Barca fielding a relatively inexperienced side, Benfica was unable to find a way through and must now settle for the Europa League. Bayern Munich share points with Dortmund . In Group F, Bayern Munich secured top spot with a comfortable 4-1 win over 10-man BATE Borisov. Mario Gomez gave last season's finalist a 22nd minute lead with Thomas Muller adding a second. Xherdan Shaqiri grabbed Bayern's third before BATE was reduced to 10-men when Denis Polyakov was shown a second yellow card. David Alaba hammered home a fourth with seven minutes remaining, before Yegor Filipenko hit an 89th minute consolation. Valencia was forced to settle for second place following its 1-0 win at Lille courtesy of Jonas' 36th minute penalty. In Group H, Galatasaray pulled off a crucial 2-1 win at Braga to book its place in the next round. Mossoró had given the Portuguese side a 32nd minute lead as Galatasaray's hope began to fade. But top scorer Burak Yılmaz equalized with his sixth goal of the competition, before substitute Aydın Yılmaz hit the winner. It was hard to swallow for Romanian side Cluj, which recorded one of the most famous results in its history to win 1-0 at Manchester United. Luis Alberto's stunning strike ensured Cluj became the first Romanian team to triumph at Old Trafford. But with Galatasaray also winning, Cluj will now have to fight it out in Europa League.","Chelsea becomes first defending champion to exit competition at the Group Stage .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Gloria Allred's demand that a transgender contestant be allowed to compete in the Miss Canada Universe pageant was trumped Tuesday when pageant owner Donald Trump agreed with her. It was a public relations battle featuring two well-known masters of the media, a beauty queen and a controversial topic. On the East Coast was Trump, whose fortune and brand is boosted by his ability to navigate storms of controversy. On the West Coast was Allred, legendary for her ability to draw hordes of cameras to her Beverly Hills law office to capture her outrage over alleged injustices done to her clients. The client is Jenna Talackova, a 23-year-old, 6-foot-1-inch tall blond Canadian, who underwent sexual reassignment surgery four years ago. Talackova won a regional beauty crown qualifying her for Canada's national title, but she was then told the May 19 Miss Canada Universe pageant in Toronto was only open to ""naturally born females."" ""I am a woman,"" Talackova said in a prepared statement she read to reporters in Allred's conference room Tuesday. ""I was devastated and I felt that excluding me for the reason that they gave was unjust."" Allred's statement attacked Trump for questioning Talackova's sexuality. ""She did not ask Mr. Trump to prove that he is a naturally born man or to see photos of his birth to view his anatomy to prove that he was male,"" Allred said. How she became a female is not important, she said. ""The Miss Universe competition is designed to find the one person in the world whose human qualities make them worthy of the Miss Universe crown and title,"" Allred said. ""Jenna is beautiful in every way. Her life story will undoubtedly inspire people throughout the world."" Talackova, in a 2010 interview, said she knew she was a girl at age 4. She said she started hormone therapy at age 14 and underwent sexual reassignment surgery at 19. Trump, warned of Allred's attack when the lawyer alerted reporters Monday afternoon that she would hold the news conference, shifted his pageant's position in an announcement Monday night. Talackova could compete provided ""she meets the legal gender recognition requirements of Canada, and the standards established by other international competitions,"" the Miss Universe Organization said. Trump's maneuver didn't appear to temper Allred's outrage. ""The last-minute statement by Mr. Trump's representative put out late yesterday only confuses the issue,"" she said. ""Instead of stating clearly that Jenna will be allowed to compete, Mr. Trump qualifies it by adding conditions that are ambiguous."" She asked Trump for ""a clear answer -- not a wimpy, wishy-washy type of answer -- but something that we can take to the bank."" Allred didn't know it then, but Trump gave a clearer statement to CNN in New York two hours earlier. ""We went by the laws of Canada and the laws of the United States, and those laws say that she should be allowed to enter the pageant,"" Trump said. ""So she will be entering the Miss Canada pageant."" When read Trump's new statement, Allred paused for several seconds and said ""I stand by my statement. We want this rule eliminated."" ""We want a clearer statement that this rule will be eliminated,"" Allred said. ""Step up, say it loudly, say it clearly, this rule will never be in effect again for anyone."" Allred declined to have Talackova react to Trump's decision to let her compete. ""Sorry,"" Talackova whispered to the reporter, apologizing for her silence. Allred would not say if her client still intended to compete in the pageant. Controversy over pageant rules is not new for Trump, who owns and controls the Miss Universe franchise. The media stir over Miss California Carrie Prejeans's same-sex marriage comments at Trump's Miss USA pageant three years ago raised the profile of that competition. Prejean, in response to a question from a judge, declared her opposition to same-sex marriage. Trump initially said Prejean could keep her Miss California title despite a controversy over topless photos, missed appearances and her statements against same-sex marriage. He eventually fired her for ""contract violations,"" including missed public appearances. Allred has affected more than beauty contests. She hosted several news conferences in 2010 to reveal evidence that Meg Whitman, who was then the Republican nominee for governor of California, employed an undocumented worker. The October surprise hampered Whitman's campaign at a crucial time in her race against Jerry Brown, who won the election.","""She should be allowed to enter the pageant,"" Miss Universe owner Donald Trump says .

"Hollywood celebrated television's best and brightest at the 61st Emmy Awards on Sunday night. ""Gossip Girl"" Blake Lively was the night's best-dressed in a pailette-encrusted Versace gown. While many actresses played it safe in classic cuts and neutral colors, there were a few standouts, mostly young stars who brought excitement to an otherwise ordinary red carpet. ""Gossip Girl"" Blake Lively was the night's best dressed in a pailette-encrusted Versace gown with a plunging neckline and thigh-high slit. With this bold choice, Lively secured her place as Hollywood's sexiest young star -- a style icon in the making. Lively's ""Gossip Girl"" co-star Leighton Meester, another style star to watch, opted for a less overtly sexy look. Meester showed just enough skin in a delicately draped, goddess-inspired gown by Bottega Veneta. Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series nominee Debra Messing chose a ruby-hued, Swarovski-encrusted column gown by Michael Kors. Not surprisingly, red was one of the night's hottest trends and ""The Starter Wife"" star's take was simple and elegant.  See photos of the best dressed from the red carpet » . Best Actress nominee Drew Barrymore went for pure old Hollywood glamour in a classic strapless design from Monique Lhuillier. The ""Grey Gardens"" star's dress stood out on the red carpet thanks to its unexpected blush color and 41embroidered tulle details. ""Damages"" star Rose Byrne looked breathtaking in a frothy, princess-like design by Valentino. The Outstanding Supporting Actress nominee made the ethereal crystal-embellished tulle gown look perfectly modern by pairing it with sleek, natural hair and subtle makeup. ""Big Love"" had a big night with two of the show's stars making waves on the red carpet. Known for her adventurous fashion choices, Chloe Sevigny chose a classic one-shoulder cut in a non-traditional polka-dot print. Her co-star Ginnifer Goodwin also wowed, in a sexy fuchsia Yves Saint Laurent gown with an exaggerated sweetheart neckline.  Watch CNN's Alan Duke talk about celebrity swag » . A surprising addition to this year's best dressed was reality-TV star Kim Kardashian. While she often looks over-the-top, Kardashian kept it simple in a white, one-sleeve gown with a '70s feel by designer Ina Soltani. She was one of a few stars to take a fashion risk that really worked on the red carpet. Other daring red-carpet standouts were January Jones, who ditched her prim and proper 1960s Mad Men wardrobe in favor of an edgy Versace with a futuristic glass-beaded bustier, and Olivia Wilde, who chose a one-shoulder lace gown with uber-revealing cutouts by Marchesa. The only envelopes pushed tonight were those between presenters and award winners. That said, Hollywood's new crop of young stars brought fresh fashion to the red carpet.

"(CNN) -- Few of you were surprised that despite spending more per person on health care than any other country, Americans are getting sicker and dying younger than our international peers. ""This should be baffling but seeing the downward spiral our nation is taking, it's real no surprise. Is this our new reality?"" @Blonde_Cake tweeted. The National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine released the report -- titled ""U.S. Health in International Perspective: Shorter Lives, Poorer Health"" -- on Wednesday. The report was commissioned to figure out why life expectancy in the United States is increasing at a slower rate than in other high-income democracies. A panel of experts spent 18 months analyzing data from 16 ""peer countries"" for the report. CNN commenter stevecray said, ""They needed 18 months to determine the problem! It will take me less than a minute: obesity, sedentary lifestyle, a for-profit healthcare system controlled by insurance and pill-pushing pharmaceutical companies that try to limit preventative healthcare."" The panel found that United States lacks many social programs that other governments provide that could negate the effects of poverty. ""With Medicare and Social Security costs 'out of control,' at least according to some, why would we want people to live longer?"" commenter Jmm72 asked. ""If they waved a magic wand and our life expectancies suddenly jumped to world-class levels, it would break the bank. Good thing the only measure that counts in the U.S. is profit."" Commenter Rollins said: ""Countries who mind their business and do not involve themselves in wars every few years can do such things. The U.S. gives millions away to foreign aid (and) we get involved in conflicts that are not in our best interests because our politicians are owned by special interest groups."" Commenter Bbcblogger argued that social problems can be found on a micro level as well. ""Study after study on individuals that have high longevity (shows they) have strong social communities. That is the one common factor they all share. Yet what is the first thing I hear when foreigners visit the U.S.: 'No one even says hi to you' or ' People don't even know who their neighbor is.' We are becoming more and more isolated, and it shows in more than one way."" Micah also placed part of the blame on individuals' shoulders: ""It stuns me that people aren't better about their personal health when they can learn so much from doing maybe a day's worth of research to see what is good and horrible for you."" Although the report said not all of Americans' health disadvantages stem from our health care system, readers were quick to point the finger in that direction. But WrkrB had a different take: ""Universal health care? If you've got a minor medical problem and you live in Italy, great! If you need open-heart surgery or some other expensive procedure, you get on a waiting list and hope your name comes up before your number is up."" The report also talked about America's obesity epidemic and how our environment may be playing a role. Several of our readers weighed in on the food culture in America. @rickydepass tweeted: ""We invented the term #supersize."" ""I moved from Europe to the U.S., about six months ago,"" Nic wrote. ""First observation after a visit to the supermarket: fruits and vegetables way too expensive; cheap products stuffed with fats and sugars. In short, if you want to kill off a whole population, slow but sure, I couldn't come up with a better strategy.""

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Wearing hooded sweatshirts, baseball hats and sports gear, the five young men alternated between nodding their heads to the rhythm and taking hold of the microphone to pour out their anger, their insights, their pain. ""No matter if you're Muslim, no matter if you're Christian, no matter the religion, we all are human,"" intones DK. The scene and sounds wouldn't be unusual in many U.S. cities, where rap has been part of urban culture for decades. But this is Baghdad. Members of the Smashing Hits, as the quintet calls itself, are aware that their music may seem out of place in Iraq. Traditionally, the Middle Eastern country is better known for sounds emanating from instruments like the oud and rebab, rather than from a microphone or turntable. Yet this group not only embraces American culture, it literally speaks its language -- modeling American idols Eminem and the late Tupac Shakur, and rapping exclusively in English rather than the native tongue of Arabic. The reason for that choice is that they want people in the West to understand what's really happening in their homeland. ""It's ... a message to the West ... to make them know who we are, things we can do here -- not just the violence, the terrorists,"" said Thoulfiqar Harith, or Fop, the group's 19-year-old founder. Beyond speaking English, they feel that rap offers them an authentic, powerful medium to express what they see and how they feel. That's why, for the past two years, the friends say they have recorded self-written tracks inside a small studio and rapped at outside venues. While they hope their music will catch on, for now they say they fund the effort themselves. During a recent performance before a small audience in a city field, the dark side of Baghdad was woven into many of their lyrics, as is the sentiment than many outside Iraq don't really understand what the situation is like. Rapped one member, ""We livin' in hell and nobody hears our calls; everyday in Baghdad, our tears do fall."" The hurt, and thus the lyrics, are raw and personal for men like DK, or Omar Ayad. His best friend Fadi, a 25-year-old neighbor whom he worked with at a newspaper, was among 70 killed on October 31, when militants stormed Baghdad's Sayidat al-Nejat Cathedral, or Our Lady of Salvation Church. Afterward, he penned a rap railing against the attackers who ""in the name of Allah (tried) to kill my brother,"" as well as the ""dead bodies in the streets."" A Muslim, Ayad said he grew up with many Christian friends, who have been increasingly targeted around the country because of their religion. The church siege, and the violence overall, hit him hard. But he said that he's glad to have an outlet with the Smashing Hits, not just to voice his feelings but also to bond with friends. ""The most important thing is they are really, really good guys,"" Ayad said of his fellow group members. ""It's really hard to find people with good hearts, big hearts.""","Smashing Hits is an English-language rap group based in Baghdad .

"(CNN) -- Chemical weapons engulf soldiers carrying 60-pound rucksacks, their mud-filled boots trenching through a river dividing simulated enemy lines. Troops run in the desert to acclimate to harsh conditions with winter temperatures as low as 8 degrees, summer as high as 120. The training becomes increasingly realistic in the weeks before deployment, mirroring the topography they may endure, but not necessarily the human terrain -- the cultures they'll be dealing with. And in a foreign land, something as seemingly innocuous as a thumbs-up sign or shaking a woman's hand can land a soldier in trouble. While physical conditioning and live-fire exercises certainly help prepare troops for deployment, they're culturally blind if they don't understand the people among whom they'll be fighting. In the 21st century, when the U.S. is at war with ideals as much as -- if not more than -- foreign armies, this blind side can be as dangerous as your M249 jamming. ""This makes warfare a lot more complex. So we have to be much more expeditionary. We have to be more intelligence-minded, more people-minded. We have to understand the populations that we're operating in and among,"" said Nick Dowling, a former National Security Council director who runs the culture-training company, IDS International. The past decade has taught the U.S. Army many lessons. According to Gen. Ray Odierno, Army chief of staff, the biggest takeaway from Iraq and Afghanistan is the importance of ""understanding the prevailing culture and values."" To address tomorrow's conflicts, Odierno revealed an initiative in March 2012 to regionally align brigades with the six unified command zones. The plan aims to create brigades better equipped to operate in specific regions by establishing language and cultural proficiency programs in their assigned territory. Currently, anthropology, language and 10,000 years of heritage are squeezed into troops' curricula a few weeks before deployment, what Dowling calls ""cultural training on steroids."" Between pre-deployment paperwork and drills, they are handed a small pamphlet outlining some history and cultural no-nos to avoid. Former soldier Joseph Hurst recalled there was sparse cultural training before his 2003 deployment to Iraq. ""They gave us an English/Arabic translation book, told us things not to say and do like give the OK sign, which is seen as an obscene gesture, and that was about it,"" he said. As the Army concludes its mission in Afghanistan, top military leaders are not only looking back but also forward to what the 21st century holds as new threats arise. The enemy du jour is manifested in ethnicities spanning more than one country, yet adhering to the same ideals, making borders often meaningless. Take al Qaeda in Iraq and Al-Shabaab in Somalia: The Islamist groups may be on different continents, but they subscribe to similar ideals, inciting state-to-state rivalries. Col. Jeff Broadwater said efforts to craft a more culturally savvy Army is an effort to foster more symbiotic relationships across various regions. Broadwater is a commander with the 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, aka ""Dagger Brigade,"" which is the first force to be regionally aligned. Dagger Brigade will provide U.S. Africa Command with defense guidance and security enhancement beginning March 2013. ""By increasing their security and capabilities, it will prevent potential future threats to their countries as well as the U.S.,"" he said, adding that such proactive measures could actually make U.S. deployments unnecessary in the future. The Africa-aligned armored brigade of 4,000 troops based out of Fort Riley, Kansas, will still maintain core combat skills, such as gunnery, live-fire training and medical training so it can respond to any mission globally, but the brigade will have a more tedious training regimen than the one-size-fits-all approach applied to current general forces. Africa hosts a multitude of customs. More than 2,000 languages (and by some counts, as many as 3,000) are spoken on the continent. Most Africans adhere to some brand of Christianity or Islam, but there are also animist beliefs as well as ethnic and folk mythologies. You can also find a smattering of Hindus and Jews. To ""put a sharper point on the pencil,"" as Broadwater explains it, experts and advisers will school soldiers in demographics, religious breakdowns, dominant languages, political landscapes and general cultural understanding. Watch Army chaplain share thoughts on cultural mistakes in Afghanistan . Their training can include lessons as disparate as proper social interactions and the kinds of weapons systems that a country's basic security force might be equipped with, said Lt. Col. Joel Buenaflor, who helps plan the regionally aligned forces. For example, Islam in many countries forbids men from touching a woman who isn't a relative, and this includes shaking her hand, a common American greeting. Former soldier Hurst also said showing the soles of your feet is disrespectful in Iraq. In Egypt, the thumbs-up sign is considered offensive. The training will be tailored to the needs and requests of nations hosting U.S. troops, with the aim of ""transferring knowledge to our counterparts to bring them to a proficiency level where they can help us in the future,"" said Col. Matthew McKenna, commander of the 162nd Infantry Brigade, which will help train Dagger Brigade to become more culturally adept during its time in Africa. The 162nd currently functions as a combat adviser for foreign security forces, responsible for training all Army personnel deploying for the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Already, several African nations have requested 90 small-scale missions to familiarize their soldiers with weapons and basic rifle marksmanship. They've also requested combined military exercises and that the U.S. Army help them enhance live-fire capabilities, medical training and logistics, so Dagger Brigade will focus on those requests, McKenna said. ""We also have 27 larger collective exercises which are developed to build the capacity of the regional peacekeeping brigades within Africa,"" he said. But even before deploying, Dagger Brigade is already encountering obstacles. With the Pentagon's 2013 fiscal budget slicing 80,000 troops over the next five years, the Army is wrestling with the question: Who's going to pay for this? ""I think in the long term, though, the Army sees this as a more efficient way to train the staff,"" Dowling said. Odierno seems to agree, as he made the regional alignment a top pillar in his Army 2020 objectives aimed at making leaders more adaptive and equipment more modern. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrated how cognizance of cultures, ethnicities and religions was essential to understanding the source of conflict, Broadwater said. Dowling added that the training alone can help a soldier better understand the lay of any land. Even if troops received cultural training specifically for African nations, it would be better to use that unit in the Middle East than troops who weren't culturally aligned at all, he said. ""Anthropologically, socially, economically, they'll have to reset what the answers are, but the right questions will already be in their mind,"" he said.","The United States is at war with ideals as much as or more than foreign armies .
Troops' curricula to include demographics, religion, languages, political landscapes .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. diplomatic cable written five years ago concluded that the government of India condoned torture of suspects held in detention centers in Jammu and Kashmir, a region that has seen a long guerrilla war by Muslim separatists, many supported by Pakistan. The cable, obtained by WikiLeaks and published by The Guardian newspaper in Britain, describes a confidential briefing from a representative of the International Committee of Red Cross. In interviews with nearly 1,500 detainees over a three-year period, it had received reports that included sexual abuse, stretching and the use of water and electricity. ""The continued ill-treatment of detainees, despite longstanding ICRC-GOI [Government of India] dialogue, have led the ICRC to conclude that the New Delhi condones torture,"" the cable says. For the ICRC, such a briefing for U.S. diplomats appears to have been unusual. Previously it had limited itself to general comments on the human rights situation in Kashmir ""in order to respect their confidentiality agreement with the GOI."" However, the relationship had become strained, with ICRC representatives unable to gain regular access to senior officials. The cable gives a detailed summary of the ICRC's interviews with detainees. ""In 852 cases, detainees reported what ICRC refers to as ""IT"" (ill-treatment): 171 persons were beaten, the remaining 681 subjected to one or more of six forms of torture: electricity (498 cases), suspension from ceiling (381), ""roller"" (a round metal object put on the thighs of sitting person, which prison personnel then sit on, crushing muscles -- 294); stretching (legs split 180 degrees -- 181), water (various forms -- 234), or sexual (302)."" The ICRC acknowledged that the human rights situation in Kashmir had improved. Ten years previously, there were some 300 detention centers; now there are ""a lot fewer."" It also had meetings with the security forces. The cable noted one ""bright spot."" The Chief of the Indian Army Staff, Lieutenant-General Joginder Jaswant Singh, had made discipline a central theme of a recent conference and had stipulated that his officers should use ""minimum force"" and avoid ""collateral damage"" in their units in order to reverse declining standards in discipline. But even though the ICRC has raised issues of abuse for more than 10 years, it continued.  ""Detainees were rarely militants (they are routinely killed), but persons connected to or believed to have information about the insurgency."" The ICRC representative had never been permitted access to the ""Cargo Building,"" the most notorious detention center in Srinagar. The cable concludes that ICRC data on ""ill-treatment and torture in detention centers are very disturbing, because the practice continues unabated."" India's Ministry of External Affairs disputed those claims. ""India is an open and democratic nation, which adheres to the rule of law. If and when an aberration occurs, it is promptly and firmly dealt with under existing legal mechanisms in an effective and transparent manner,"" the ministry spokesman Vishnu Prakash. ""In India, there's a healthy tradition of democratic debate and freedom of expression on all issues that concern the welfare of our citizens anywhere in our country."" The ICRC on Friday confirmed the meeting referred to in the cable took place and refrained from commenting ""publicly on the content of such discussions."" ""It must also be stressed that the ICRC cannot take responsibility for the content of the cables, which emanate from representatives of the U.S. authorities,"" the ICRC said. ICRC said it and India signed an agreement providing for a framework for ICRC's detention activities. It said the ""work is ongoing,"" findings are discussed confidentially, and the quality of discussions with India has ""clearly improved."" As for sharing information with the United States, the ICRC says it ""engages in a sustained dialogue with the concerned authorities of the countries where the ICRC works with the aim of addressing concrete humanitarian issues. In very specific instances this dialogue may be extended to third parties who may play a role in addressing humanitarian situations."" Another cable the following year acknowledged the security challenges India faced in Kashmir. ""Kashmiri terrorist groups made numerous attacks on elected Indian and Kashmiri politicians, targeted civilians in public areas, and attacked security forces, killing more than 500 civilians in 2005, most of whom were Kashmiri Muslims."" The same cable suggested that political violence in India was abating. ""At a time when many nations appear to be losing ground to extremist movements, India's trendlines are pointing in the right direction, bolstered by strong indigenous traditions of communal co-habitation, non-violent political protest"" and other factors. However, the cable noted that in the absence of training and the collection of evidence ""terrorism investigations and court cases tend to rely upon confessions, many of which are obtained under duress if not beatings, threats, or, in some cases, torture."" In 2007, the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi recommended denying a U.S. visa to a Kashmiri paramilitary leader, Usman Abdul Majid. A leaked cable said the group was ""notorious for its use of torture, extra-judicial killing, rape, and extortion of Kashmiri civilians suspected of harboring or facilitating terrorists."" There was further unrest in Srinagar, the capital of Jammu and Kashmir, earlier this year, when the death of a student hit by a tear-gas grenade sparked widespread street protests. Tens of thousands of Indian security forces remain deployed in the region. The ICRC has a policy of not sharing with the media its discussions with governments.","The cable gives a detailed summary of the ICRC's interviews with detainees and allegations of torture .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf on Sunday met with Shiites in Quetta who are protesting the bombing deaths of 97 people last week, Pakistani media reported. Ashraf addressed protestors who are taking part in a sit-in and have lined up the bodies of bombing victims at major intersections. He said he would meet one of the two major demands of the group, tossing out the provincial government and putting a governor in charge. However, Ashraf said he wouldn't implement military rule in the city but would leave it up to the governor to ask for more help -- if needed -- from paramilitary forces to try to quell the violence. It was unclear when the sit-in would end, as leaders of the protest said they will take a wait-and-see approach to the change in government. Local Shiites have also refused to bury most of the victims after a series of bombings rocked Quetta on Thursday, police official Wazir Khan Nasir said. Relatives of the deceased have sat beside the bodies in freezing temperatures over the past three days. Symbolic protests occurred in other cities, including Islamabad. Earlier, Ashraf also condemned the blasts in Quetta. ""The prime minister, while expressing his heartfelt condolences and sympathies with the bereaved families, reiterated the government's resolve to stamp out the menace of militancy and terrorism from the country in its all shapes and manifestations,"" said a statement from his office. Not burying dead bodies immediately after death is taboo in Islam. The soul of the body is not considered to be at rest until the body is in the ground. Quetta is the capital of Balochistan province, an area regularly plagued by violence. In addition to sectarian attacks on Shiites, unrest in the province is believed to be fomented by several insurgent groups, including the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army and the Pakistani Taliban. Read more: What's working in Pakistan . Although Balochistan is the largest province in Pakistan geographically, analysts and some locals have criticized the federal government for neglecting it, leading to instability. The Shiite community has repeatedly asked for more protection but to no avail. Last week's string of attacks was the deadliest so far against the minority Shiite community, which has been targeted repeatedly in the past by groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a banned Sunni militant group. The deadliest explosions were two suicide bombings in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood known as Alamdar Road. One blast brought police, rescue workers and journalists rushing to the scene. It was swiftly followed by another explosion -- set off by a man sitting in a car with more than 100 kilograms of explosives -- that hit many of those responding to the initial attack. The double bombing, described by police as one of the worst attacks on the Shiite minority, killed 85 people and wounded about 150. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the Alamdar Road attacks. More on Pakistan: India and Pakistan trade accusations over Kashmir violence . Shiites, a minority sect in mainly Sunni Muslim Pakistan, face persecution from extremists. Last month, more than 20 Shiite pilgrims were killed when a car bomb detonated near the buses they were traveling in. Mir Zubair Mehmood, a Quetta police official, said the Alamdar attacks were motivated by Sunni and Shiite sectarian differences. Another blast in Quetta on Thursday struck a security checkpoint in a busy market, authorities said. A bomb planted in a car detonated as security forces entered the area, killing 12 people and wounding 45, according Nasir, the police spokesman. Nasir blamed the attack on Baloch insurgents. A fourth bomb went off by the side of the road leading to the city's airport, wounding three. Read more: Malala, others on front lines in fight for women .

"(CNN) -- The search for a lion in Essex, near London, has been called off -- even as the big cat's fame grows on Twitter. According to a police spokesman, the sighting of a lion Sunday night was most likely a ""large domestic cat or a wildcat."" The spokesman added: ""Nothing has been found to suggest that a lion was in the area."" The search had been underway since holidaymakers reported seeing a lioness roaming through the fields Sunday evening. As the search continued many took to Twitter to claim sightings, while the @EssexLion account picked up more than 35,000 followers. Personal trainer Danny Osborne claimed the ""lion"" is in fact a snow leopard with a fake tan and hair extensions, while comedian David Schneider tweeted he spotted the lion taking refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. The police statement said: ""We would like to thank the local community and holidaymakers for their patience and support throughout the past 24 hours, as the police and media presence would have been somewhat overwhelming for them."" The lion's Twitter fame followed holidaymakers reporting what they believed was a lioness on the loose. Sue Wright told CNN she believed she saw a ""a lioness in the field"" when she looked through her binoculars following an alert from her sister-in-law. Wright said the animal was very big -- probably reaching above a person's waist. She said she became ""very concerned particularly when it stood up, because we weren't sure in what direction it was going to head."" In an earlier statement, Essex Police had said both they and experts from Colchester Zoo had scoured the area, using the police helicopter's thermal imaging camera to try to find the animal. The police had advised people to be ""extra vigilant and cautious.""","The search for a lion in Essex, near London, has been called off .

"(CNN) -- There was a pretty epic party on Wednesday night. You probably weren't there. But don't take it personally. We can't all be awesome. Naturally, of course, I was present, showing up casually late because it's what awesome people do at epic parties. That, and defile the mashed potatoes. Granted, this particular epic party was held on Twitter. And it was hosted by CVS. And, technically, everybody was invited. Thus, I'm suddenly now beginning to question my awesomeness. Me: ""Am I awesome?"" Me: ""Not really."" Me: ""I appreciate your honesty."" Me: ""Whatever, nerd."" OK, so maybe it's not Ibiza, but there was a popular online party hosted by the CVS Beauty Club to promote the pharmacy's cosmetic offerings via social media. And for a good hour or so during the big digital soiree, the hashtag was a leading trend. Hurrah! Victory for the marketing department! Treat yourself to some hooker makeup. (Seriously. That section exists, right?) Not surprisingly, however, a random dude eventually entered the conversation and was instantly confused. @TheClassyMan wrote: ""This is a joke right?"" Not a joke. CVS really managed to get people talking about and participating in their virtual Twitter party, which is pretty amazing. But how exactly does something like this work? Basically, I guess a Twitter party is just like any other party. People talk. Strangers mingle. Except there's no guacamole, and if you happen to do a keg stand, it's not because everybody else was doing one. It's because you're a degenerate alcoholic. ""Wooooo! Thirty seconds! I rule! And now I have to fold the laundry ... and do other stuff because I'm home alone with my computer ... drinking ... from a keg. Woooooo."" Personally speaking, the most appealing aspect of a digital Twitter party is that I only have 140 characters to completely embarrass myself. Which, I suppose, is quite more than enough. ""Hi. I'm Jarrett. I use Beano."" See? Minimal damage. But let's get back to this beauty club. Essentially, anyone can join for free to get periodic discounts and rewards on various CVS cosmetics. The online information wasn't exactly clear, though, as to whether Beano qualifies. Its inclusion, however, more or less determines my interest in signing up. Maybe. I'm all about discounts and Twitter parties and Beano and maybe even a touch of mascara when I'm feeling pretty, but I'm not exactly sure this is qualifies as a ""club."" Clubs have to have standards, and I simply can't appreciate any exclusive organization that doesn't charge excessive dues and/or base one's membership on blatant superficiality. That's why back in the day I joined a fraternity. Best friends money could buy! Look, I know I didn't offer the American University chapter of Delta Chi anything in terms of social status, and I'm pretty sure I lowered their overall combined GPA by at least a full point, but I was more than willing to pay the yearly fees. And as a bonus, I could pretty easily be talked into running around the party wearing nothing but a strategically placed sock. (Had there been cell phone cameras in the late 90s, I'd currently be living in Mongolia.) At the CVS Beauty Club, there are no initiation fees. No dues. And technically, I suppose, even Nick Nolte could join. It's that easy. But for those of us who don't use cosmetics or, at the very least, aren't planning on going to the Gathering of the Juggalos, there's probably no real need to apply. We're fine the way we are. Perfect fives. Unless, of course, you really just want to experiment with ointments and colors and masks. In which case, by all means join the CVS Beauty Club and start saving. Hell, go nuts!

"London (CNN) -- Celebrity comedians were among hundreds who on Friday welcomed a UK court ruling that cleared a man of sending a tweet joking about blowing up an airport. The case has highlighted the arguments for and against the limits of free speech on the internet. Paul Chambers was originally fined Â£385 ($603) and ordered to pay thousands in court costs after being found guilty in 2010 of sending a ""menacing tweet"" that read: ""Crap! Robin Hood Airport is closed. You've got a week and a bit to get your s--- together, otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high."" He claimed it was a joke and sent it during a moment of frustration while the airport in the north of England was closed by snow. The original trial heard that the tweet was discovered when an airport manager, who was not a Twitter member, searched for ""Robin Hood Airport"" on the social networking site. Thousands of people joined an online campaign to support Chambers, retweeting his message, and recently posting Twitter comments under the hashtag #twitterjoketrial. The high-profile British actor, broadcaster and prolific tweeter, Stephen Fry, said Friday: ""Complete vindication and victory for Paul Chambers in #twitterjoketrial. Well done @DavidAllenGreen and team."" In its ruling, the court said: ""The appeal against conviction will be allowed on the basis that this 'tweet' did not constitute or include a message of a menacing character. ""It was treated and addressed as if it was not a credible threat. The airport police took no action."" The verdict prompted a grateful response from Chambers who said to his Twitter followers: ""We couldn't have done this without you, we wouldn't have got close."" British comedian Frankie Boyle tweeted: ""#twitterjoketrial means comedians will feel more secure tweeting jokes and people making threats will try work in some humour. It's Win-Win."" Another British actor and comic, Ricky Gervais, who has notched up major TV successes on both sides of the Atlantic, was more provocative in his reaction, tweeting: ""Original Judge in The Paul Chambers twitter joke trial admits he was only joking when he convicted Paul."" Ben Goldacre, a prominent author and scientist, added: ""He may have got off, but after years of angst and expense #twitterjoketrial is a disappointing stain on the credibility of the UK judiciary."" Defense solicitor in the case, David Allen Greene, was equally scathing in his reaction, tweeting: ""This shameful prosecution should never have been brought. The DPP [Director of Public Prosecutions] made the personal decision to oppose the appeal. Disgraceful."" The hashtags #Paul Chambers and #twitterjoketrial were both trending in the UK Friday, but if anyone was opposed to the verdict they were not immediately visible on the social networking site. In contrast, hundreds of tweets supported the court decision, with one poster calling himself The Sev, summing up the sentiments of many of them: ""Today the courts ruled you're allowed to make jokes on Twitter.""","Paul Chambers was originally fined Â£385 ($603) for sending a ""menacing tweet""

"New York (CNN) -- For the first time since 1979, New York City school bus drivers went on strike Wednesday -- a protest that is affecting more than 150,000 students. As of 6 a.m. Wednesday, about 8,800 bus drivers walked off the job after city and union officials failed to reach an agreement, according to a spokeswoman for Local 1811 of the Amalgamated Transit Union. Bus drivers are demanding job security through what is called Employee Protection Provisions (EPP). The provisions assure that senior bus drivers and matrons will get priority over newcomers. They also protect wages and pensions, according to the union. Mayor Michael Bloomberg denounced the strike, saying the union is ""seeking protections that aren't provided in any other school districts in the nation"" and that members want ""job guarantees that they just can't have."" The impasse comes after Bloomberg, in a bid to cut costs, put out bids for nearly 1,100 bus routes currently handled by Local 1181 drivers. Last year, the city bid out contracts for preschool bus routes, and the new contracts will save taxpayers $95 million over five years. Strikers picketed Wednesday at 30 locations around the city's five boroughs. ""It's unfortunate that those that are hurt most by the mayor's actions and the chancellor's actions are the city's most vulnerable schoolchildren and their parents,"" ATU Local 1181 President Michael Cordiello said outside a Queens bus depot where several dozen bus drivers and matrons picketed . The school system has 1.1 million students. New York's State Court of Appeals has deemed the union's requests for job protection illegal, Bloomberg said. ""[The city's] job is to get the lower price we can to get the jobs that we need to get done,"" Bloomberg said, adding that the city does not employ the members of the union. ""Employees that are striking have to resolve their issues with the bus companies that employ them, not us."" Cordiello said, ""Despite public pronouncements, it is not illegal to put the EPP in the bids."" Frustrated union members blasted the mayor's approach to the negotiations. ""This is the reason why the EPP was put back in the day â€” it was to ensure that when we're behind the wheels, and the matrons, they're professionalsâ€”they're well-trained. But what the mayor wants to do now is pay people low wages. And what you paid is what you're going to get,"" said Edwin Beniquez, a bus driver of 12 years. The city made contingency plans for the strike, with schools handing out transit cards for both parents and students, and also reimbursements for any personal vehicle use or car service expenses, according to the Office of Pupil Transportation. ""It throws my day off about an hour,"" mom Karima Johnson told CNN affiliate WABC-TV. ""So I'll be going to work a little bit late because I have to take her to school."" According to preliminary data, attendance for the day was 1% below the average for the rest of the month, Department of Education spokeswoman Erin Hughes said. CNN's Jason Kessler contributed to this report.","Bus drivers strike in NYC .

"(CNN) -- Machinery problems at a drug manufacturing plant prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to warn patients of a possible mix-up affecting various prescription pain medications and over-the-counter drugs. The FDA is advising patients who use certain prescription medications produced by Endo Pharmaceuticals to visually inspect their pills. And consumers who have select bottles of Excedrin, Bufferin, NoDoz and Gas-X, produced by Novartis, are being told to discard or return the products in a voluntary recall that started Sunday. The over-the-counter drugs involved in the recall were manufactured at a Lincoln, Nebraska, facility which also produced various prescription pain medicines for Endo Pharmaceuticals, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These pills include Percocet, Opana and Percodan. ""Due to problems that occurred when these products were packaged and labeled at the site, it's possible that tablets from one product may have been retained in the packaging machinery and then may have carried over into the packaging of another product,"" said Dr. Edward Cox, director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products, Office of New Drugs, Center for Drug Evaluation of Research for the FDA. ""This could result in an incorrect pill ending up in the bottle of another product. The likelihood of this occurring in medication dispensed in patients is estimated to be low,"" he added. The prescription opioids could have ended up in the bottle of another prescription drug or over-the-counter products, although ""the risk of pills ending up in the wrong bottle is a rare event,"" according to the FDA. There have been no reports of adverse events due to this problem, Cox said. Patients who take an affected Endo Pharmaceuticals products should visually inspect all the pills in their bottles, according to the company and FDA. Endo Pharmaceuticals posted pictures of the products on their web page for tablet identifications. The products listed there: Opana ER (oxymorphone hydrochloride) extended-release tablets CII; Opana (oxymorphone hydrochloride) tablets CII; oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets CII; Percocet (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen USP) tablets CII; Percodan (oxycodone hydrochloride and aspirin, USP) tablets CII; Endocet (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen USP) tablets CII; Endodan (oxycodone hydrochloride and aspirin, USP) tablets CII; Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets CII; and Zydone (hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen tablets, USP) CIII. ""We are asking patients to check their medicines, to look for any tablets of a different size, shape or color from their regular medicine,"" Cox said. ""If they find any tablets that are different, stop taking the pain medication and take the medicine to the pharmacy. We are telling patients to look carefully at all tablets in pain medication bottle."" Patients who have questions should contact Endo Pharmaceuticals or their doctors, he advised. Pharmacists are also being asked to ""visually inspect and verify the identity of all tablets dispensed,"" Cox said. ""The likelihood of finding a wrong pill in an opioid pain medication is low,"" he said. ""Patients should not be alarmed. These steps we're recommending are additional steps we are recommending to further reduce an already low likelihood of medication mix-up."" The Nebraska plant has been temporarily shut down, which could cause drug shortages and disruptions in the supply chain for Endo Pharmaceuticals. ""We anticipate that there may be a short-term disruption in the supply of these products to patients. This temporary supply disruption is not related to the efficacy or safety of these products,"" according to the company. ""We are not aware of any patient having experienced a confirmed product mix-up and there have been no adverse events attributable to a product mix-up. We believe the likelihood of product mix-up reaching a patient is remote,"" according to the company.

Novartis had suspended operations at, and shipments from, the Lincoln, Nebraska, facility. The company said this was done ""to accelerate maintenance"" and make other improvements, adding that it currently ""is not possible"" to determine when the plant will reopen.

"(CNN) -- Expect traffic this month, as more than a quarter of the country hits the road for the holidays. Some 93.3 million Americans will travel more than 50 miles from home during the year-end holiday travel period, predicts AAA. That's an increase of 1.6% over 2011. This year, AAA defines the holiday period as Saturday, December 22, to Tuesday, January 1, 2013. Don't be a jerk en route to dinner . ""The year-end holiday season remains the least volatile of all travel holidays as Americans will not let economic conditions or high gas prices dictate if they go home for the holidays or kick off the New Year with a vacation,"" said AAA President and CEO Robert Darbelnet in a statement. ""Primary economic indicators all show modest improvement from last year and AAA is projecting an increase in the number of Americans stuffing their stockings with airline tickets and hotel reservations,"" said Darbelnet. Abandoning the hearth for Christmas . The national average price of gasoline has dropped about 50 cents a gallon since September but is still at a record high, AAA said. The price may continue to drop and could average $3.20-$3.40 a gallon by January 1, 2013. The drop in gasoline prices may not have an impact on the number of cars on the road, but it could free up money for more spending on presents, dining and entertainment, according to AAA. Some 90% of U.S. travelers (84.4 million) say they expect to drive to their destinations this year, a 1.3% increase over last year. Some 5.6 million people will fly, an expected increase of 4.5%. Approximately 3.3 million will use other modes of transportation. Americans are expected to travel an average distance of 760 miles this year, an increase from the 726 miles the average traveler expected to drive last year. Travelers are also planning to spend more: AAA predicts median spending of $759 this year, an almost 6% increase over last year. In a separate forecast, trade group Airlines for America predicted that 42 million passengers will fly over a 21-day holiday period between December 17, 2012, and January 6, 2013. That figure reflects an expected dip of about 300,000 passengers, or a 1% decline, from last year. ""We still have a relatively tepid, albeit growing economy, with high unemployment levels,"" said John Heimlich, the organization's chief economist. Airlines are experiencing strong bookings relative to available capacity. Planes are expected to be about 85% full, rising to nearly 90% on the busiest days, December 21, 22, 23 and 26 and January 2. ""This is a great time to travel, as carriers are staffed to accommodate the influx of holiday travelers and airfares remain a bargain, having significantly trailed U.S. inflation,"" Heimlich said in a statement. Average airfares are up year over year, but adjusted for inflation, flying costs about 14% less than it did in 2000, according to Airlines for America. Where are you traveling this holiday season?

"(CNN) -- It was around 6:30 in the morning. The air was crisp, the farmers had just watered their fields -- corn perhaps, Omar doesn't entirely recall -- and the ground was muddy, slippery and uneven. There was a pack on his back, a bag slung over each shoulder, and cradled in his arms, the frail body of his 11-year-old brother Abdulrahman. Abdulrahman, the baby of the family, couldn't walk on his own. His left leg was blown off in late July. Read more: Cave becomes classroom for Syrian kids . The last words of the driver who dropped them off echoed in Omar's mind: ""You're on your own now."" It was as far as the car could safely take them in Syria, a few hundred meters from the Turkish border. Omar's back ached, his arms in agony. He focused on putting down one foot after the other, struggling to keep his balance. He looked down at Abdulrahman's face every few minutes and tried to smile reassuringly. Read more: Who is arming the Syrian conflict? ""The only thing that I could think was to arrive, that whatever I was going through, once I arrived it was all going to be OK,"" Omar said. For the safety of the brothers and their family back in Syria we are omitting their last name, specific locations, and other identifying details. ""There were fighter planes and there was a rocket that hit close to our house,"" Abdulrahman says quietly about the day he was injured. ""I went to see what was going on and another rocket hit."" He doesn't say much beyond that; at times simply nodding or smiling sweetly, or seemingly lost in his memories. Tears slowly overflow out of Omar's eyes. He slowly wipes them away as he looks down at Abdulrahman. Read more: Why region fears al-Assad's 'blackmail' in Beirut . Omar, 21, was sleeping when the first rocket hit. His mother, panicking, came running into his room. ""My mom woke me up saying, 'Stand up immediately.' She said Abdulrahman went out and the plane is roaming, is circulating above, you need to get him back to the house,"" Omar tells us. He was too late. ""I kept running, the first guy saw Abdulrahman injured and he said 'Catch up to your brother, he's about to die.' I can't control, I ran, ran, ran. When I got there, they told me the ambulance has just taken him."" Read more: Exiled Syrian writer honored for 'Diaries' of revolt . Abdulrahman doesn't speak to us about those moments. But Omar says his brother recounted how people were running away. ""He was wounded, and he began shouting, 'Isn't there anyone to carry me?'"" Omar found his brother in the makeshift field clinic, in the basement of the town's mosque. ""Once he saw me, he shouted 'Omar!' -- shouted with all his strength. I didn't see what happened, I just saw blood. When I got closer I saw his leg and I just yelled and I started crying."" Abdulrahman's leg was amputated; there was no way to save it. It was practically entirely severed just below the knee. ""After he woke up I was crying, I couldn't control myself, and he said, 'If you love me don't cry,'"" Omar recalls, eyes slightly widening, acknowledging our amazement at his brother's strength. He says Abdulrahman made him promise not to cry in front of their mother. ""I said I will control myself,"" Omar continues. ""I told him, do you know where your leg is? He said, 'I know it's cut, I keep feeling it, it hurts.' I told him it just went before you to heaven."" Read more: Defecting Syrian propagandist says his job was 'to fabricate' And that is also when Omar made another promise to his younger brother: that he would walk again. Omar started working to save money for a prosthetic, but quickly realized that it would take too long to raise the funds. He began asking around, went online. A group of Egyptian doctors happened to be visiting the field clinic, and they told him about the Global Medical Relief Fund, a small U.S. nongovernmental organization that is dedicated to helping children badly wounded in disasters and war zones. GMRF takes care of children's follow-up prosthetics and physical therapy until they reach the age of 21. The founder, Elissa Montanti, quickly responded: Yes, of course, she would take on his case, but first the brothers had to get to Turkey. They did make it safely across the border. And after a long and arduous journey navigating a country they don't know, a language they don't speak and with meager funds, they made it to Ankara, the Turkish capital, where they are now waiting. Montanti has been working on the brothers' paperwork to get Abdulrahman to the U.S. for medical treatment, made all the more challenging because they don't have passports. Their visa requests were denied. Now they are waiting to see if the State Department will grant them humanitarian parole. Omar pulls his brother in closer, gently stroking his cheek. The two, always close, are now inseparable. But Abdulrahman, despite his frequent shy smiles, is constantly plagued by the memories. ""He has nightmares and sometimes daydreams, bad daydreams,"" Omar tells us. ""He says 'I feel it, I feel just like there is a snake around.' I keep telling him it doesn't exist and he says it hurts and starts screaming."" Abdulrahman, under his breath, says he sees a big one, surrounded by smaller ones. Omar says his mind is always churning, obsessed with make sure his brother is, quite simply, OK. ""All the time I think how to make him comfortable. It's just like raising a child -- I have to take all the responsibilities. He needs to be educated again. I want to take advantage of this situation to teach him languages, everything I can."" Tragically, Abdulrahman has already learned one of the harshest lessons of all. ""The most important thing that he's learning at this time,"" Omar says, ""it's to be aware, to grow up his mind. He's not a child anymore.""","11-year-old Abdulrahman lost his leg during a rocket attack is Syria .

"(CNN) -- A fourth man has pleaded guilty to a federal hate crime in the death of a black man who was beaten by a gang of young whites, then run over by a pickup truck driven by one of them in Mississippi in 2011. In a separate but related case, another Mississippi man admitted he was part of a group of whites who carried out other racial attacks against African-Americans around the same time. William Kirk Montgomery, 23, from Puckett, Mississippi, pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal hate-crime charges in the death of James Craig Anderson, who was murdered on June 26, 2011, in Jackson, Mississippi, the prosecutor says. Jonathan Gaskamp, 20, admitted to two federal hate crime charges in other attacks carried out on other African-Americans in or around Jackson. James Craig Anderson, 47, died after he was beaten and run over by a truck driven by Deryl Dedmon, who was part of a group of seven whites, mostly teenagers, from largely white Rankin County who decided to ""go f**k with some n*****s"" after a night of partying and drinking, law enforcement officials have said, quoting some of the suspects in the case. Life sentence in Mississippi hate crime case . Montgomery was one of the ones who left that party in search of a victim. Anderson, a worker at a local auto plant, was outside a Jackson hotel when he was confronted by the group. Anderson's death became national news after CNN obtained and aired videotape capturing the gruesome murder as it happened. The death of the black man, and the shocking videotape showing the murder, prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in Jackson, a city of about 537,000 people. On the videotape, two vehicles carrying the group of whites pull into the parking lot and stop where Anderson is standing, although he is just off camera and not visible. The young men can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and Anderson. Witnesses told authorities this is when Anderson's beating took place, as the whites yelled racial epithets, including ""white power."" On the videotape, Anderson first comes into view in the lower right corner of the screen, after he was beaten, according to police. He staggers into the headlights of the green F-250 truck, his white shirt easily visible. The truck backs up, then suddenly surges forward. As the truck nears the defenseless man, its headlights glow brightly on his shirt before he suddenly disappears underneath it. Three of the other whites who were there that night pleaded guilty to federal hate crimes earlier this year. Dedmon, John Aaron Rice and Dylan Butler, all now around age 20, each admitted to conspiracy and violating the 2009 federal hate-crimes law. They face sentences of up to life in prison and $250,000 in fines, federal prosecutors said. Dedmon also pleaded guilty to state murder and hate-crime charges in a state court and was sentenced to life in prison. Murder suspect carried 'backpack of hatred' Gaskamp was at a party with the others when they discussed going out to hunt and hurt blacks on the night Anderson was killed, authorities said, but he was not present when the group came upon Anderson. However, he was present at other attacks at other times, prosecutors now say. CNN had reported previously that the attack on Anderson was only one of a number of racial attacks carried out by the gang of young whites and others who were with them at various times, based on witness accounts and sources close to the investigation. Prosecutors have long told CNN that the additional attacks might bring more arrests or charges. Various groupings of the young men would, at various times, hunt out and target blacks, or others who appeared homeless or drunk, prosecutors said. These people were likely targeted, authorities said, because the group members believed they would be less likely to report attacks to police or to fight back. In these other attacks, according to prosecutors Tuesday, the group of white young men, sometimes along with young women, on numerous occasions drove from Rankin County, which is mostly white, over to Jackson, which is mostly black, specifically with the intent of assaulting blacks. Group members would often boast about what they had done later, prosecutors said. In late 2011 CNN filmed an interview with one former member of the gang who had changed his ways and felt bad about their behavior. That former member told CNN on camera that the group of whites would ""go out hunting"" for blacks to hurt on weekends. But until Gaskamp's plea Tuesday, no details of such attacks had been made public, or had even been substantiated. In one of the other incidents the gang carried out, prosecutors say, Gaskamp and other white teens drove to Jackson to find an African-American to assault, and Gaskamp brought with him a .40-caliber handgun. The group hurled beer bottles at numerous black pedestrians they ran across. Then, after seeing one black man who appeared to be drunk, a group of white teens set upon him, according to prosecutors. In that incident, prosecutors say, Dedmon, Rice and Gaskamp were among the ones who punched and kicked the man repeatedly on his face and all around his body, ""until the man begged for his life."" After the group left the man beaten and wounded on the street, Gaskamp wanted to go back ""so that he could use the gun he had brought with him to shoot the African-American man they just assaulted,"" according to court papers. But the group did not go back that night. ""These teens laughed and boasted about what they had done,"" said Robert Shuler Smith, the district attorney for Jackson and the main prosecutor in the case. And in court, federal prosecutor Sheldon Beer said, ""Members of the group thought it was funny that the man pleaded for his life."" Gaskamp could be sentenced to up to five years in prison for one count and 10 years for the other, Smith said. Montgomery faces up to five years for one count and up to life in prison for the other. Prosecutors tell CNN there may be other arrests or charges. ""This case is not over,"" Smith said. ""This is still ongoing. We would like to pursue justice fully for the Anderson family. We want the Anderson family to be pleased at the end of this case that justice was done.""","William Kirk Montgomery of Puckett, Mississippi, pleads guilty to federal hate-crime charges .

"(CNN) -- The West Indies team bus has been attacked by Bangladesh fans, following the side's one-sided victory over the co-hosts at the Cricket World Cup. The West Indies secured a nine-wicket victory in 12.2 overs in the Group B game in Mirpur on Friday. Bangladesh scored just 58 runs -- their lowest ever total in a one-day match --which led a group of angry fans to throw stones at the West Indies bus as it traveled back to the team hotel. Should minor nations play at the Cricket World Cup? ""Bangladesh stoning our bus,"" Windies opener Chris Gayle -- who hit his 8000th one-day run during the match -- wrote on social networking site Twitter during the incident.""Glass break. Can't believe...what next bullets!"" The former national captain continued: ""This is ridiculous. World Cup with so many security and this happens. Big Joke. Trust me I'm not keen here."" The Deputy Commissioner of Police in the capital Dhaka claimed that disappointed fans had in fact thought the bus belonged to the Bangladesh team. ""They thought it was the Bangladeshi team bush and they hurled stones at it,"" Imtiaz Ahmed told news agency AFP. ""The window panes were shattered, but no one was injured."" The West Indies' win over Bangladesh marked their second consecutive victory in the World Cup following their win over The Netherlands, and the team now lie second in the table behind South Africa. Sulieman Benn claimed four wickets, while Kemar Roach and Darren Sammy took three each for the West Indies -- encouraging performances for the Caribbean side ahead of their upcoming fixtures against England and Ireland. For Bangladesh the loss means they now find themselves placed sixth out the seven teams in their group, and must beat England in their next tie on March 11 to have any chance of qualifying for the quarterfinal stage. Meanwhile, in the Group A clash at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmadabad, India earlier on Friday, New Zealand defeated Zimbabwe by 10 wickets to claim their second win of the tournament . After bowling out their opponents for just 162 runs, the Kiwis cantered recorded up two half-centuries courtesy of Martin Guptill and Brendon McCullum with 99 balls to spare.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Two Kenyan police officers were injured in Dadaab refugee camp in Northern Kenya when their vehicle struck a land mine on Tuesday, according to a senior official. ""The police car was traveling from Hagadera camp to the Dadaab police station,"" said Dadaab District Commissioner Ndambuki Muthike. Muthike said that the rear of the vehicle struck the land mine and two policemen at the back of the vehicle sustained injuries. ""They are in a stable condition in Dadaab,"" said Muthike, adding that the injuries were not life-threatening. Less than two weeks ago another police vehicle struck a land mine on the same road without detonating it. Kenyan troops are battling the Islamic extremist group Al-Shabaab in neighboring Somalia. ""With the fighting in Somalia,"" Muthike said, ""we now have some of the terrorist here in Dadaab. But this is an isolated incident."" The increasing danger caused by the escalating conflict in Somalia is a concern especially for children, the United Nations Children's Fund said in a statement. ""Somali children's lives are being put more and more in grave danger with the increasing conflict,"" said UNICEF representative Sikander Khan. According to the U.N.'s monitoring and reporting mechanism, 24 children have been killed in the conflict in October -- nearly double the number of child killings confirmed in every other month this year. Another 58 children sustained serious injuries last month, the largest number of children injured as a result of the armed conflict in Somalia in any month this year. The U.N. has confirmed nearly 300 children seriously injured and over 100 children killed in the ongoing conflict this year. Though the death rate is already high, Khan believes it could be even greater, because many deaths go unreported. ""Increasing numbers of children and civilians are being caught in attacks and cross-fire across the south and centre of Somalia,"" said Khan. The recruitment and use of children for armed services and sexual violence against children and women are other concerns for UNICEF. Khan has called for an end to the violence by all parties involved in the Somalia conflict. ""All children must immediately be assured of safety and protection from hostile acts,"" the statement said. The escalating violence also threatens the delivery of humanitarian assistance to people in the region who need help. ""Many of the hundreds of thousands of children already facing a situation of life and death due to famine and disease are now facing the risk of having life-saving assistance cut off to them."" Since the abduction of two foreign workers of Doctors Without Borders, U.N. and charity groups have significantly scaled back their humanitarian work at the world's largest refugee camp.","Kenyan officers injured when their car strikes a land mine .

"Washington (CNN) -- Thursday, December 13, may have been one of the luckiest days of Susan Rice's life. It may not feel that way now since she had to set aside for the moment her longtime dream of becoming secretary of state. But it is one thing to be secretary of state in theory and it will be quite another to be America's top diplomat during the next several years. Rice, it must be said, was cheated out of a job for which she was well-qualified by a broken political system in Washington. She became a pawn in the campaign battle between the president she has ably served at the U.N. for the past four years and Republicans who sought to make her a scapegoat for the tragic mess that took place in Benghazi on September 11. She did nothing wrong except to do what an administration spokesperson is supposed to do, present the unclassified facts of the case as they were known and as her colleagues in the White House, intelligence and diplomatic communities concluded they ought to be presented. Democrat 'extremely upset' with Rice's withdrawal . Sen. John McCain led the effort to block her possible nomination as secretary of state with the assistance of colleagues like Sens. Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte. The fact that this forced Rice to submit a letter to the president withdrawing her nomination reflects the amount of power our system gives even one or two senators who are intent on blocking or dragging out a nomination. It may be a testimony to McCain's influence and his tenacity. It will certainly not be seen as a high water mark in his distinguished career. His opposition was petty, partisan, disproportionate to the facts of the Benghazi case that he used to frame his opposition, and inconsistent with the spirit that should prevail when a president presents or even floats his choice for a job as one of his top advisers. Rice withdraws from consideration as secretary of state . What the withdrawal of the Rice nomination was not was a sign of presidential weakness. Quite the contrary, the decision by the White House to accept Rice's withdrawal from consideration and allow her to remain as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations showed considerably more wisdom and public-spiritedness than was evinced at any time by the opposition. Great international challenges loom for the United States. To subject the country to a long drawn-out confirmation battle simply to prove who has the upper hand and in so doing to potentially weaken the eventual occupant of the office Thomas Jefferson was the first to hold would be of no benefit to anyone in the United States. The president had other good choices and would have access to the advice and service of Rice from her post at the U.N. He didn't blink. He kept his eye on the ball. Now, it seems likely that sometime in the next few days, the president will nominate someone else to the Foggy Bottom job. It is rumored that person may be Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is among the most qualified possible candidates for the job and would have no problem getting confirmed. McCain, in fact, is a close friend of his. Whoever gets the nod, however, may someday wish they did not. For one thing, the next secretary of state has very big shoes to fill. Hillary Clinton has been exceptional in the job, leading a remarkable resurgence in U.S. diplomacy, playing a central role in helping to restore America's standing in the world, being an architect of resetting this country's international priorities from the pivot to Asia to the recognition of the importance of emerging powers worldwide, from embracing the power of new information age tools of diplomacy to continuing her lifelong effort to win greater equality for women and other disenfranchised populations. There's an old saying in Washington that one secret to job success is picking the right predecessor and in that respect, whoever is next has a tough act to follow. More daunting by far is the world that will confront the next secretary. Not only do we face a situation in the greater Middle East that may be more dangerous than it has been at any time in history, but in case after case, America's leverage is weak, our options are lousy and our enemies are well-positioned. Opinion: An unfair portrait of Susan Rice . Egypt was a vital partner for peace and is now, at best, a question mark. Its new leader, Mohamed Morsy, has shown a propensity for authoritarianism and the group he represents, the Muslim Brotherhood, has extremist elements within it that many in the region fear may be inclined to help spread unrest to other moderate states like Jordan or some of those in the Gulf. President Bashar al-Assad may be teetering in Syria but the chaos that will follow his fall is likely to be as great as is our uncertainty about the motives and capabilities of many in the opposition. Iran continues to taunt the world with its seemingly relentless drive to acquire nuclear weapons and it may be that in the next year the United States will be confronted by the question of whether we are willing to use military force to stop them. Al-Assad losing control but showing no signs of leaving . Iraq and Afghanistan were challenging during the past four years to be sure. But President Obama was elected essentially to get out of these places and he made great strides in both in that respect. But now comes the hard part. In Iraq, the regime we have supported has been far too close to Iran, corrupt and may not be able to hold the country together. In Afghanistan, we may find that the only way to leave the country with a semi-stable government is to give substantial power to members of the Taliban, the group we sought to get rid of when we invaded the country. Neighboring Pakistan, with scores of nuclear weapons, a massive, struggling population and uncertain politics, is considered by many to be the most dangerous place in the world. We may have gotten Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders, but the terror network and others are resurgent, gaining strength across the Middle East and spreading into Africa. Obama's cabinet: Who's in, who's out? Europe continues to struggle with its severe economic problems. Japan has lurched into recession again. North Korea is testing long-range missiles. Japan and China are nose to nose in a dispute over contested islands. China itself is not only a rising rival but a vital economic partner, a place presenting equal portions of opportunity and risk. Further, the Chinese leadership is new and will be testing the United States and, at the same time, using whatever measures it must to maintain stability at home. Russia is causing trouble in Syria. We have great domestic challenges at home. We have done nothing to address global warming and the consequences are becoming ever more apparent. Our international institutions are as weak as we long ago designed them to be and there is little appetite to make them stronger even though the proliferation, climate, trade, financial and health challenges we face all strongly suggest they must be. While America itself may be entering a resurgent period, our recovery is likely to be fragile and clearly, as the Rice incident and the fiscal cliff clown show illustrate, Washington is bereft of the ability to do even the minimum we might expect of it. None of this means calamity is certain. None of this assures American decline. I for one, believe the United States will be the world's sole superpower for many decades to come. But what it does mean is that over the next four years we will face extraordinary challenges worldwide and at home. And for those reasons, it may well be that being the next secretary of state will be every bit as great a trial as it is an honor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","Rothkopf: Susan Rice may be lucky not to achieve her dream of becoming secretary of state .

"(CNN) -- The mother of ""Modern Family"" star Ariel Winter denied allegations that she abused the 14-year-old actress and said the allegations stem from the young actress wanting to continue to date an 18-year-old man. ""Since I have asked Ariel to end her relationship ... she has been bad-mouthing me and spreading rumors and lies about me to substantiate this Guardianship proceeding,"" the mother said in documents filed last week in Los Angeles Superior Court. ""Ariel is young and does not understand the severity of the consequences of her actions."" Winter, whose real name is Ariel W. Workman, stars as Alex Dunphy in the ABC comedy series. Last month, a Los Angeles judge ordered the young actress to be placed in temporary guardianship of her older sister, Shanelle Gray. A lawyer filed a petition on behalf of Gray on October 3, alleging Winter was the victim of ongoing physical abuse, insults about her weight, deprivation of food and attempts to ""sexualize"" the minor. Guardianship with Gray was necessary to protect Winter from further abuse, lawyer Michael Kretzmer said in the document. The mother, Chris Workman, vehemently denied those allegations. She said she never hit her daughter or put her down for her weight. The dispute stems from a relationship with an older teen, the mother alleged. ""Ariel is upset and is using her sister's vulnerabilities to her advantage so she can see her boyfriend,"" Workman said in the court documents. ""I caught Ariel and (the teen) engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior, which is when I became adamant that she end her relationship with him. Out of concern for Ariel, I notified the police since Ariel is a minor."" A judge has previously ruled that Workman have no contact with Winter until a November 20 hearing on the matter. CNN's Jane Caffrey and Selin Darkalstanian contributed to this report.","Young actress on ""Modern Family"" is under temporary guardianship .

"(EW.com) -- I bet Eddie Murphy would like to trade places with another actor right about now. The ""Saturday Night Live"" alum tops Forbes' list of the year's most overpaid actors again, followed by newcomer Katherine Heigl and Oscar winners Reese Witherspoon and Sandra Bullock (say it isn't so!). Murphy's earning power has steadily declined since his string of '80s hits, including ""Trading Places"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop."" His voice work in ""Shrek"" and ""Mulan"" and family-friendly roles in ""Norbit"" and ""Dr. Dolittle"" left him in good standing, but his recent films, ""Imagine That,"" ""A Thousand Words,"" ""Meet Dave,"" and ""Tower Heist,"" flopped at the box office. EW.com: Ashton Kutcher is highest-paid TV actor, followed by Hugh Laurie and Ray Romano . Forbes calculates that for every dollar Murphy was paid for his last three films, they returned an average of $2.30 at the box office. Hollywood's one-time go-to romcom leading lady, Heigl, fell close behind Murphy. Her films earned an average of $3.40 for every dollar she was paid. Her most recent movie, ""One For The Money,"" reeled in $37 million on an estimated $40 million budget. However, her upcoming ensemble pic, ""The Big Wedding,"" starring Robert DeNiro, Susan Sarandon and Amanda Seyfried, is sure to give her more wiggle room. Witherspoon ranks third with an average $3.90 return for every dollar she was paid, thanks to 2010â€²s ""How Do You Know"" and this year's ""This Means War."" EW.com: Oprah tops Forbes list of highest-paid celebs, Michael Bay trails close behind . Bullock comes in fourth with a $5 return for every dollar she was paid. Although ""The Blind Side"" was one of 2009â€²s most successful films, her two other films from the last three years, ""All About Steve"" and ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"" suffered at the box office. Rounding out the top five, Jack Black returned $5.20 for every dollar he was paid. Here's the full list: . 1. Eddie Murphy -- Returns $2.30 for every $1 paid. 2. Katherine Heigl -- Returns $3.40 for every $1 paid. 3. Reese Witherspoon -- Returns $3.90 for every $1 paid. 4. Sandra Bullock -- Returns $5 for every $1 paid. 5.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Police in South Korea have detained a man suspected of abducting a 7-year-old girl from her home and raping her, local police officials said Friday. The parents of the girl realized she was missing at 7 a.m. Thursday and looked for her before reporting it to the police half an hour later in Naju, a city in the southwestern province of South Jeolla, said Kim Il-kyu, head of the criminal investigation department in Naju. The city's police officers called for backup and 160 personnel from nearby police stations joined the search for the girl, he said. The girl was found at 12:55 p.m. Thursday on a sidewalk near a river in the city, according to Kim. She was naked, wrapped in a blanket and showed signs of having been raped, he said. She underwent an operation for organ damage, Kim added. According to the police, the girl had been sleeping in the living room of her home with her mother and three siblings. She told officers she was taken by a man she didn't know. She was due to be questioned by a social worker on Friday. Body fluid samples have been taken to the Criminal Investigation Laboratory, according to Kim. The police detained a suspect on Friday and took him to the police station in Naju for questioning, said two police officers with knowledge of the case who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. As public outrage over the case grew, President Lee Myung-bak made an unscheduled visit to the National Police Agency in Seoul on Friday. According to CNN affiliate YTN, Lee apologized for the authorities' failure to prevent the attack from taking place. ""The general public is extremely concerned about the lack of public order,"" he said. ""The police should make every effort to restore public order."" South Koreans responded with anger on social media to news reports about the case. ""The offender should get the highest punishment possible,"" a person using the name Yeonbang1996 said on Twitter. Others called specifically for the attacker to be castrated. A law authorizing the use of chemical castration, a drug treatment intended to suppress sexual impulses, on some sex offenders came into effect in South Korea last year. People over the age of 19 who have sexually offended against children under the age of 16 and are diagnosed with pedophilia can be subject to the treatment, according to the Justice Ministry. Journalist Yoonjung Seo contributed to this report.","The girl is taken from her home while her family is sleeping, the police say .

"(CNN) -- Apple, the world's most valuable company, became definitively less valuable on Monday after news the global tech giant halved its orders for screens for the iPhone 5. According to Japan's Nikkei news service, Apple had originally ordered 65 million iPhone screens for the 2013 January-to-March quarter from its suppliers which include Japan's Sharp Corp. and South Korea's LG Display Co. Apple's share price plunged 3.57% to $501.75 -- its lowest point in 11 months -- continuing its slide from September 19 when the company's share price hit an all-time high of $702.10. Investors holding 100 shares of the company on that day would have lost more than $20,000 after Monday's close of trading. The reports of Apple's cuts for LCD screens, as well as other parts, now have many fearing that demand for the iPhone 5 have been weaker-than-expected, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Just last month, Jefferies analyst Peter Misek already cut his estimate for iPhone shipment volumes for the first quarter of 2013, saying Apple had to ""balance excess inventory"" by cutting orders to suppliers. In the global smartphone market, Apple has consistently trailed its biggest rival Samsung of South Korea. Fewer than two in ten smartphones that shipped in the third quarter of 2012 ran on Apple's iOS operating software, according to researcher International Data Corporation. In the same quarter, Google's Android software, which serves as Samsung's operating platform, ran more than seven in ten smartphones around the world. In the global tablet market, IDC expects Apple will have maintained its number one position in 2012 with a 53.8% market share -- but that is a fall from a 56.3% share in 2011. At the same time, Android's market share is predicted to have grown from 39.8% in 2011 to 42.7% for 2012. ""Android tablets are gaining traction in the market thanks to solid products from Google, Amazon, Samsung, and others,"" said IDC in a press release. To shore up some support, Apple's CEO Tim Cook last week traveled to China for the second time in ten months -- a visit interpreted by some as an effort to fight Apple's falling market share in the country. Apple fell from fourth to sixth place in market share in the third quarter of 2012, according to IDC. In his same visit, Cook said he expects China will eventually surpass the United States as its largest market, though he did not give a time frame. ""We are continuing to invest in retail stores here and will open many more over the next several years,"" said Cook. ""We have some great sites selected, our manufacturing base is here, and we have incredible partners here. So it's a very, very important country to us."" In addition to dispatching its CEO, Apple is also expected to dispatch new iterations of its iPhone and iPad products, perhaps as early as June or July, which may propel the company's stock price as past launches have in the past. In the near-term, Apple is set to reveal earnings for its first fiscal year on January 23. That report will include profit numbers for the first full quarter in which the iPhone 5 was on sale.","Apple has halved its orders for screens for the iPhone 5 .

"(CNN) -- After 21 months of bloodshed and a failure by the international community to do anything to stop it, the U.N.-Arab League point man on the Syrian crisis expressed confidence Sunday that a political resolution is possible. Lakhdar Brahimi's optimism followed talks in Geneva with Russian Deputy Foreign Mikhail Bogdanov and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns, which he called ""constructive and held in a spirit of cooperation."" Getting Russia on board any international plan is seen as key because it has been an ally of Syria's government and blocked tough measures against President Bashar al-Assad in the U.N. Security Council. In a statement, Brahimi said the diplomats ""explored avenues to move forward a peaceful process and mobilize greater international action in favor of a political solution."" ""All three parties reaffirmed their common assessment that the situation in Syria was bad and getting worse,"" said Brahimi, who was appointed a joint special representative in August, according to a story on the U.N. news website. ""They stressed a political process to end the crisis was necessary and still possible."" This conviction comes at a time when violence in Syria continues to rage. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Friday that more than 40,000 people have been killed, with half a million seeking refuge in other countries and nearly 3 million internally displaced. The grim toll grew yet again on Sunday, with the opposition Local Coordination Committees reporting at least 116 deaths nationwide, including 10 children and four women. Forty-one of those deaths were in and around Damascus, and 32 were in Aleppo, including 20 burned near a Syrian Air Force Intelligence facility. In addition to civilians caught in the crossfire, Sunday saw more skirmishes involved organized fighting forces on both sides. The LCC said there were 97 clashes Sunday between Syrian troops and rebel Free Syrian Army members, who have made inroads around the Middle Eastern country in recent weeks. Opposition fighters have also taken steps of late to unify their ranks, with disparate Free Syrian Army units agreeing Friday to appoint a civilian rebel council leader and a military council leader for each Syrian province. The commanders will be under the leadership of a newly named chief of staff, Gen. Salim Idris, Free Syrian Army spokesman Louay Almokdad said. The united military front follows the creation of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, a new coalition of groups opposed to al-Assad's leadership. The United States, in particular, has pushed for opposition factions to unite. Another diplomatic focus has been trying to find a common international approach to Syria, in hopes that shared thinking -- especially involving friends of al-Assad -- can hasten an end of the war. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov joined Brahimi last Thursday in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to discuss Syria. Clinton said that meeting didn't produce a ""breakthrough,"" but it was a start. She called for all facets of Syrian society -- except for al-Assad -- to be part of any transition. Russia said the countries should brainstorm with Brahimi on a peaceful transition and a political settlement. The possibility that Syrian forces could employ deadly chemical weapons -- something Damascus has denied -- has heightened the sense of urgency. Syrian forces began combining chemicals that would be used to make deadly sarin gas for use in weapons to attack rebel and civilian populations, a U.S. official told CNN last week. That possibility triggered international outcry, including from Russia, which sent strong messages to al-Assad warning him he'd lose their support if he used chemical weapons. The United States and some European allies are using defense contractors to train Syrian rebels on how to secure chemical weapons stockpiles in Syria, a senior U.S. official and several senior diplomats told CNN Sunday. The training, which is taking place in Jordan and Turkey, involves how to monitor and secure stockpiles and handle weapons sites and materials, according to the sources. Some of the contractors are on the ground in Syria working with the rebels to monitor some of the sites, according to one of the officials.","The U.N.-Arab League envoy on Syria meets with Russian and U.S. diplomats .

"(CNN) -- After six days of protests that packed the state capitol, Wisconsin's major teachers' union called on members to start returning to work Monday but keep fighting a proposed rollback of union protections for public employees. ""To educators whose contracts do not recognize Presidents' Day, we call on them to return to duty by day -- and find ways to be vocal and visible after their workday is done,"" Mary Bell, president of the nearly 100,000-member Wisconsin Education Association Council, told members in a statement issued Sunday afternoon. ""To those whose contracts recognize Presidents' Day as a holiday, we call on them to return to Madison."" But other unions said they plan to continue demonstrations into Tuesday, and not all members of Bell's union had decided to follow her lead. Members of Madison's WEAC local, the MTI Teachers Union, have voted to remain at the capitol on Monday at least, its president, Mike Lipp, told CNN. ""I think every teacher in here wants to be back with their students, but we also understand that there are important points to be made,"" Madison high school teacher David Olson told CNN. ""And so far, we've done a good job of using our collective action to force the issue and to make sure people understand why we're fighting. It's an important fight to continue."" Wisconsin's new Republican governor, Scott Walker, is pushing a state budget bill that would severely curtail collective bargaining for public employees. Walker says the measures are needed to head off a $3.6 billion budget shortfall by 2013 that could result in thousands of layoffs. But the issue has triggered widespread resistance from unions, even those that won't be affected by the plan, and the 14 Democrats in the state Senate have fled Wisconsin to stall a vote on the plan. ""It is not about specific negotiation points,"" Matthew Kearney, a member of the Teaching Assistants Association and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told CNN on Sunday. ""It's about the existence of unions, the fact that this bill would make it impossible for public unions to exist in Wisconsin. That's what's it's designed to do, to destroy public unions."" The demonstrations caused schools districts to cancel classes in Milwaukee and Madison for much of last week as large numbers of teachers took the day off work to protest. Some teachers have been given doctors' notes to excuse their absences from physicians sympathetic to their cause, protesters told CNN. And an estimated 55,000 people turned out for Saturday rallies at the capitol, mostly in opposition to Walker's plan. Several thousand more packed the building on Sunday, sending up a rousing cheer when a group of firefighters -- who, along with police, are exempt from Walker's proposed bill -- joined them in a show of support. Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Walker denied complaints that he was trying to break up public employee unions. But he said that collective bargaining has hindered local governments' efforts to manage their finances ""time and time again."" ""The difference is, unlike those other states, I want to give those local governments the tools they need to balance the budget now and in the future,"" he said. ""They can't do that with the current collective bargaining laws in the state."" Walker called on the fugitive Democrats to come back home, telling them, ""If you want to participate in a democracy, you've got to be in the arena."" But the senators said they'll stay away unless Walker agrees to negotiations over his proposal, arguing that teachers have already agreed to pay more toward health care and pensions. ""In return, they ask only that the provisions that deny their right to collectively bargain are removed,"" state Senator Jon Erpenbach, a Democrat, said Saturday.

"(CNN) -- A slew of weather warnings and watches extended Tuesday from northeastern Texas to southern Maine as a stalled frontal system threatened some areas with heavy snow and others with significant rain. The National Weather Service said snow is likely in southern New England and the northern Mid-Atlantic states. Flash floods are possible in parts of the Southeast. Traveling conditions in several states have already become precarious. More than 170 departing flights from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport were canceled due to freezing rain at destinations throughout the South. Find your forecast . In Louisiana, police in DeSoto Parish had responded to at least 20 incidents, many on Interstate 49. Lt. Donnie Barber of the sheriff's office said there were no reports of life-threatening injuries. According to the Louisiana Transportation Department, more than 18 miles of Interstate 220 near Shreveport were closed. Many bridges in northern Mississippi were iced over, said Brett Carr, a spokesman with that state's emergency management agency. Carr added that several hundred power customers in Greenville, near the Mississippi River, were in the dark. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant issued a state of emergency ""for all counties impacted by the freezing rain, flooding and severe weather."" Tennessee also has issued a state of emergency for areas affected by the weather. The state's emergency operations center was calling in staff to monitor power outages and assist counties with roadways, said Dean Flener, a spokesman for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. The state of emergency allows local governments to call on aid from the state. The Tennessee Valley Authority said it was taking the unusual flood-prevention measure of spilling 1.5 million gallons of water per second through the Kentucky Dam near Paducah from the Tennessee River into the Ohio River. The dam usually puts out 400,000 gallons per second, a spokesman said. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: More than 18 miles of interstate closed in one section on Louisiana .

"London (CNN) -- A British Christian woman suffered religious discrimination when British Airways told her not to wear a visible cross over her uniform, a top European court ruled Tuesday. However, three other British Christians lost related religious discrimination claims at the European Court of Human Rights. Belief blog: Britain fights Christians' right to wear cross, infuriating activists . British Airways violated the article of the European Convention on Human Rights that guarantees freedom of religion when it stopped employee Nadia Eweida from wearing her cross openly, the court said. Eweida said she experienced discrimination from 2006 to 2007, when she started displaying the cross while working as a member of check-in staff. She was first sent home and then offered another role where she'd have no contact with customers. She refused to take it. The airline changed its policy on uniforms in 2007 to allow employees to wear religious or charity symbols, at which time Eweida returned to the check-in desk. In its ruling, the court weighed Eweida's desire to show her religious belief against the airline's wish to project a certain corporate image. ""While this aim was undoubtedly legitimate, the domestic courts accorded it too much weight,"" it said, referring to British Airways' position. Read more: New archbishop of Canterbury named . However, the court found that three other British Christians who argued they'd been unfairly dismissed from their jobs had not been subjected to religious discrimination. They are nurse Shirley Chaplin, who also wanted to wear a cross at work, registrar Lilian Ladele, who declined to register gay civil partnerships, and Gary MacFarlane, a relationship counselor who did not want to give sex therapy to same-sex couples. In the case of Chaplin, the court ruled that the concerns of hospital managers for health and safety outweighed the nurse's desire to wear a cross visibly in the workplace. The cases of the registrar and the relationship counselor had been fairly considered in the national courts, the court said. ""In each case the employer was pursuing a policy of nondiscrimination against service-users, and the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of sexual orientation was also protected under the Convention."" The parties in the cases have three months in which to lodge an appeal. Read more: British Muslims optimistic and proud, survey finds . The Christian Legal Centre, which directly supported Chaplin and MacFarlane, issued a statement saying the ruling ""raised questions about the future involvement of Christians in professional and public life."" Gary McFarlane said he was ""amazed"" by the court's decision, and added that there had been no need for him to be dismissed from his job. ""What happened to me was deeply illiberal. I simply wanted to do my job in light of my Christian identity but I was policed and punished for my thoughts, for my beliefs. In a truly tolerant society we make room for one another,"" the Christian Legal Centre quoted him as saying. ""Today's judgment is a worrying sign not just for those who bring their Christian faith to bear on their work but for all those who hold viewpoints that differ from the reigning orthodoxy."" Rights groups hailed the outcome, however. Shami Chakrabarti, director of the Liberty human rights group, said the judgment was ""an excellent result for equal treatment, religious freedom and common sense."" The British courts had ""lost their way"" in considering Eweida's case, she said. ""Nadia Eweida wasn't hurting anyone and was perfectly capable of doing her job whilst wearing a small cross. She had just as much a right to express her faith as a Sikh man in a turban or a Muslim woman with a headscarf."" But, Chakrabarti added, the European court ""was also right to uphold judgments in other cases that employers can expect staff not to discriminate in the discharge of duties at work."" The British Humanist Association also praised the European court for ""applying the right principles"" to the cases -- those of equality and human rights. The association's chief executive, Andrew Copson, said the political Christian lobby and socially conservative media had sought to whip up a ""victim narrative"" around the cases that had no basis in reality. ""What they describe as discrimination and marginalization of Christians is in fact the proper upholding of human rights and equalities law and principles -- principles which protect all people against unfair treatment -- and we are pleased that the court has recognized this,"" he said in a statement. ""All reasonable people will agree that there is scope in a secular democracy for reasonable accommodation of religious beliefs when that accommodation does not affect the rights and freedoms of others."" The four Christians turned to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, after losing every round of their battles through the British legal system. Their claims were filed under European human rights law, focusing on guarantees of freedom of religion and freedom from discrimination at work. The cases have been closely watched in Europe because they may help to draw a clear boundary in cases where religious views contradict laws against discrimination. The court's decisions have implications across 47 countries on the continent. The court ruling will not be binding in Britain, but the country is legally obliged to take it into account. CNN's Antonia Mortensen and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I was policed and punished for my beliefs,"" says a Christian who lost his claim .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf pledged in a speech Sunday to return to his country later this month, despite word from authorities that he will be arrested when he does so. ""I am coming, Pakistan,"" Musharraf told thousands of supporters via video link in the southern city of Karachi. ""Attempts have been made to scare me, but I am not afraid of anything."" He pledged to return between January 27 and 30. When he does, Pakistani officials said, Musharraf will be arrested in connection with the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali, a special public prosecutor in the assassination case, said a Rawalpindi court has already issued an arrest warrant for Musharraf. ""They are bound to execute the order unless a higher court sets aside the orders,"" Ali said, adding that Musharraf is accused of conspiring in the assassination. Musharraf's attorney, Chaudry Faisal, said the threat of arrest is politically motivated and has no legal bearing. The warrant is being challenged in court, the attorney said. He described the claim that Musharraf could be arrested at any time upon return as ""absurd."" The former president said Sunday that he will return even at the risk of his life. Speaking to CNN after addressing the crowd in Karachi, Musharraf said he had declined to provide a specific date because of security concerns. He spoke about the possibility of arrest, but said he expects he will be fine, so long as ""the judiciary plays its just role, and there are no interruptions."" ""There is a vacuum in Pakistan of trustworthy leaders, which is being filled by others. To exploit this vacuum, I have to be back now,"" Musharraf said. He described his support as scattered, and said he needs to build it again from the ground up. ""This is a do-or-die moment for me and my party. I need to muster all the support I can,"" he said. Musharraf, who resigned in 2008, is expected to fly into Pakistan from the United Arab Emirates later this month, accompanied by up to 500 supporters, said Jawed Siddiqi, spokesman for the former president's All Pakistan Muslim League party. ""President Musharraf told me that although the possibility of arrest is there -- there is no way of knowing what will happen, and how dangerous the situation is, until one jumps into the situation head first,"" he said. Elections are set to take place in Pakistan next year; Musharraf intends to run. On Sunday, he told Pakistanis that other politicians have failed leading the country, but ""I succeeded 100%."" ""When I took charge of the country, it was surrounded in huge problems,"" he said. ""... Today, we have to decide whether we need change or we need the same faces."" Terrorism in Pakistan, he said, ""is at its peak. We are alone in the world."" He said he restored Pakistan's economic development, increased its global standing and strengthened the armed forces. Musharraf resigned in 2008 as the country's ruling coalition began taking steps to impeach him. He was succeeded by Asif Zardari, Bhutto's widower. In 2010, the United Nations released a report that said Musharraf's government had failed to protect Bhutto before her 2007 assassination. Musharraf has rejected such accusations, saying that Bhutto had police protection and took unnecessary risks. Bhutto's assassination turned public opinion strongly against Musharraf in 2008 and led to his resignation and self-exile in London. In 2010, Musharraf said the timing of his return to Pakistan would depend on the environment there. ""My going back is dependent, certainly, on an environment to be created in Pakistan and also, I would say, with certainty, that whenever the signs of the next election comes up, I will be there in Pakistan,"" he said.

"United Nations (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council discussed Friday a resolution introduced by Morocco that calls on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down and transfer power to his vice president. The resolution also supports ""full implementation"" of the Arab League report on Syria that called on Syria to form a unity government within two months but stopped short of supporting military intervention. The Arab League report was released about a month after it sent observers into Syria. Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby and Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, are expected to brief the council Tuesday about the observer mission's findings. When asked whether that briefing would lead to a vote next week, France's U.N. Envoy Gerard Araud responded with just one word: ""Inshallah,"" or ""God willing"" in Arabic. British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said a vote could be held as soon as Wednesday on the text. ""It was quite clear that there was very strong support in the Security Council this afternoon for the text that was introduced by Morocco."" The next step is a meeting of experts from the missions of the 15 countries on the Security Council, on Monday afternoon. The Security Council has been unable to agree on any resolution on Syria. In October, Russia and China issued a rare double-veto of a resolution that lacked sanctions but would have condemned the violence in Syria. This latest draft also lacks sanctions, but is tougher than the October version, which said nothing about transfer of power. The draft resolution, obtained by CNN, calls on al-Assad to hand over authority to his deputy and calls for the formation of a national unity government. The draft gives Syria 15 days to comply or risk the adoption of further measures. Advocates of a resolution -- especially Britain, France, and Germany -- hope that a stark briefing from the Arab League will be enough to persuade Russia not to use its veto power. After Friday's meeting, Russian U.N. Envoy Vitaly Churkin said, ""I just cannot see the draft which we saw today as a basis of a possible outcome. But we will continue to engage with the sponsors of this resolution."" He said there were some red lines that he would not allow the Security Council to cross. ""The red lines include any indication of sanctions,"" he said. ""The red lines included any sort of imposition of arms embargo, because we know how in real life, arms embargo means that you supply weapons to illegal groups but you cannot supply weapons to the government. We cannot accept that. Unfortunately the draft which we saw today did not ignore our red lines but also added some new elements which we find unacceptable as a matter of principle."" He went on to say that those added things included the idea of imposing a political outcome. This week, the Russian ambassador to the United States accused the United States and Europe of trying to turn a Security Council resolution on Syria into an ""anti-al-Assad"" resolution, a step that, he argued, could ""be a recipe for disaster."" Araud was sanguine: ""Frankly, I don't think it will be too difficult to reach an agreement,"" he told reporters. And German Ambassador Peter Wittig said world body must take action. ""Let's seize this window of opportunity that we have."" But Syrian Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari was dismissive of his colleagues.

"(CNN)  -- From personal stories of growing up with gay parents to challenges of what defines a family, the public's comments on same-sex couples having families was supportive and critical, calm and heated -- sometimes all in one conversation thread. In CNN's documentary ""Gary and Tony Have a Baby,"" Soledad O'Brien follows a gay couple in their struggle through the legal and personal obstacles to become parents. We asked readers and viewers what they thought about gay couples having families. ""Whether they are gay as a couple, or gay as a single parent -- as long as they love and nourish that child it will make absolutely no difference. Compared to the atrocious things that we read here on CNN about what parents do to their children, being raised by a gay parent will be a blessing,"" says one reader. ""I work in a medical clinic and believe me, the large number of gay people/couples that we see are a helluva lot more 'normal' (and pleasant) than the straight people/couples!"" Others said that while they were against same-sex marriage, they saw no reason for sexual orientation to prevent having children through adoption or other means. ""My morals and my religion agree that marriage is between a man and a woman,"" says one reader. ""[But] I don't mind gays adopting."" Another said: ""Marriage is an institution created by God to join a man and a women. That being said, children do need someone to love and if that person is psychologically sound, physically fit and has the wherewithal to create a supportive and loving environment for the child, it would [be] hard for me to say no way."" Some said having same-sex parents would harm the child. ""Children being raised by gay couples can easily be targeted by bullies,"" said one reader. ""These children will go through a great suffering because they will be confused as to why they don't [have] a daddy or a mommy. It's a shame that the children are being exposed to something that God is against."" Another wrote: ""If there is a mother and father possibility, [a child] should always go in the favor of the normal mother and father situation. It is the responsibility of those in charge to give them the best chance to survive in a culture that is normally straight. I am not against gays, but I do think there is a reality that one gender of parents is not the norm."" Other readers shared their stories of growing up with same-sex parents or being a gay parent themselves. ""As a gay single man, it has been my honor to adopt four wonderful children,"" one reader wrote. ""Over the years we have encountered the typical family pressures as everyone else. Our only outward difference is that I am Caucasian and my children are African-American. Two of my four boys are now 18 and 19. Both are headed to college. My younger two are 15 and 16 now. Both successful high school students, happy and well adjusted (well as adjusted as a teenager can be!). ... My kids know about my life and were told when they were young. I have kept no secrets. ... Parenting means being there for your child. It mean participating in their lives. Loving them. Listening to their goals, biting your tongue when necessary and losing your mind when needed."" Another said, ""My parents love me, that's all that matters. What makes you a better parent then mine? Because you're a Christian? Because you are straight? They love me and that's all that matters. They push me to succeed, and make me the best person I can be. Isn't that what being a parent is, loving you for who you are?""","CNN's ""Gary and Tony Have a Baby"" followed gay couple's struggle to become parents .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council warned Thursday that civil war could return to Ivory Coast in West Africa after months of political deadlock. In a statement to the press, the council said the ongoing dispute over who is president of the country risks a resurgence of the civil war that erupted in 2002. The Security Council has endorsed the election of Alassane Ouattara but his opponent, President Laurent Gbagbo, refuses to leave office. The United Nations says 50 people died in violence this week in the country. The Security Council said it is deeply concerned about the recent escalation of violence, especially in the nation's largest city, Abidjan. The United Nations, following a briefing by the organization's peacekeeping director, also criticized attacks on civilians, including women. Ivory Coast's U.N. ambassador, Youssoufou Bamba, a Ouattara loyalist, said the Security Council statement should have been stronger. The envoy warned a genocide is looming against Ouattara supporters and the council should realize people are being killed along ethnic lines. The council did condemn ""threats, obstructions, and acts of wanton violence"" by Gbagbo's forces against U.N. personnel. A U.N. official told CNN in New York that U.N. forces are being harassed and U.N. contract workers kidnapped. The United Nations guards Ouattara in an Abidjan hotel as part of its peacekeeping mission. The Security Council also condemned restrictions placed on the right of expression in Ivory Coast, such as attempts to disrupt U.N. Radio and use of state radio to incite violence. The Security Council urged the U.N. mission in Ivory Coast to monitor the arms embargo that is in place. This week, the United Nations' peacekeeping director, Alain le Roy, apologized after the U.N. erroneously said late Sunday night that Belarus illegally shipped three attack helicopters to the Gbagbo forces. The United Nations and the two sides in Ivory Coast await a report by an African Union panel that visited the country and is preparing possible solutions to the deadlock.","The Security Council expresses concern about the rising violence .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Officials investigating last week's crash of two Metro subway trains said a system used to detect trains in the area of the accident had failed intermittently in the days immediately before the fatal crash. Investigators are shown at the crash scene in Washington. Nine people were killed in the June 22 accident. Officials earlier reported that the track circuit had been repaired June 17, five days before the crash. In an update Wednesday, the National Transportation Safety Board added that after the repair, the circuit ""periodically lost its ability to detect trains."" The NTSB says the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reported the problem during a post-accident review of track circuit data, but it was not immediately clear if operators were aware of the problem before the accident. A call to the transit authority was not immediately returned. In a prepared statement, Metro General Manager John Catoe said the track circuit data problem ""... is not an issue that would have been easily detectable to controllers in our operations center."" He said Metro is working with the NTSB to find the ""root cause"" of the accident, and said he wanted to assure metro riders that the system ""is as safe as it can be."" Nine people were killed in the June 22 accident. According to the NTSB, which is investigating the crash, maintenance records show that an ""impedance bond"" for the track circuit where the accident occurred was replaced June 17. The NTSB says it is now reviewing documentation on the performance of the track circuit both before and after the June 17 repair. Since the accident, the transit authority has stopped using a computer system designed to avoid collisions and is operating the trains manually, leading to delays. The NTSB, meanwhile, has been conducting nightly tests at the accident scene between the Fort Totten and Takoma stations. On the weekend of July 18, investigators intend to conduct tests to determine when the stopped train would have been visible from the train that struck it. The previously reported rail-streak marks consistent with heavy braking were approximately 125 feet long, and began approximately 425 feet before impact.","Officials earlier said track circuit had been repaired June 17, five days before crash .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations formally condemned Friday the sinking of a South Korean warship in March but did not specifically name North Korea, which a multinational probe found culpable in the incident. ""The Security Council deplores the attack,"" the 15-member council said in what is known as a presidential statement. It urged that ""appropriate and peaceful measures be taken against those responsible for the incident aimed at the peaceful settlement of the issue."" It also called for full adherence to the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement, which ended hostilities in the Korean war. Despite the absence of North Korea's name in the condemnation, U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said the message to the communist nation is ""unmistakable."" ""This statement is notable and it is clear,"" Rice said after its approval at a Friday morning session. ""It uses the term 'attack' repeatedly, which you don't have to be a scholar of the English language to understand is not a neutral term."" South Korea welcomed the statement. ""I think it's crystal clear that [the] Security Council made it clear that North Korea [is] to be blamed and to be condemned,"" said Ambassador Park In-kook. A presidential statement, unlike a Security Council resolution, is not legally binding, though it requires approval of the council's five permanent members: China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States. An international joint civilian-military investigation deemed North Korea culpable for the March 26 sinking of the warship, the Cheonan. Australia, Britain, the United States, Sweden and South Korea provided experts for the inquiry. The Security Council expressed ""deep sympathy and condolences,"" for the deaths of 46 sailors aboard the Cheonan. The statement was read aloud by the Nigerian ambassador, the rotating Security Council president for the month of July, after being voted on Friday by the full 15-member body. In June, investigation co-chair Yoon Duk-yong presented technical and visual evidence to the Security Council, saying the Cheonan was definitively ""sunk by a torpedo which was made in North Korea and the launching was also done by a North Korean midget submarine."" The isolated North has maintained its innocence, rejecting the investigation findings outright, questioning the validity of the experts involved, asking to conduct its own inquiry, and telling the Security Council that North Korea is the true victim of a conspiracy. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, called the presidential statement ""devoid of any proper judgment,"" according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. He added that the case ""should have been settled between the north and the south without referring it to the UN. The DPRK remains unchanged in its stand to probe the truth about the case to the last."" North Korean U.N. Ambassador Sin Son Ho called Friday's U.N. statement ""our great diplomatic victory."" ""From the beginning of the incident we have made our position very clear that this incident has nothing to do with us,"" he said. At a rare appearance before reporters in June, Sin questioned a number of the experts' conclusions, for instance asking how ""the body of the torpedo can remain as it is while [a] huge warship is cut down into two parts? How the torpedo can remain?"" Sin had warned, ""our people and army will smash out aggressors with merciless counteraction if they dare to provoke us."" The Security Council statement highlighted the importance of maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. It welcomed the ""restraint shown"" by South Korea in the handling of the Cheonan incident, and urged the resumption of dialogue and negotiations between the strained neighbors. A senior South Korean official called on North Korea again Friday to apologize for the Cheonan's sinking. ""North Korea must apologize for the deaths of 46 of our young men"" and punish troops involved in the sinking, Vice Unification Minister Um Jong-sik told a group of former ministry officials, according to the Yonhap news agency. CNN's Evan Buxbaum contributed to this report.","NEW: North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman calls the statement ""devoid of any proper judgment""

"(CNN) -- If you believe the Mayas, the end of the world is near. At least that's how some people have interpreted the fact that when the Mesoamericans conceived their Long Count calendar more than 5,000 years ago, it happened to stop at December 21, 2012.

"(CNN) -- A humanitarian mission from the United Nations will travel this weekend to Syria to look for effects of President Bashar al-Assad's protest crackdown, a U.N. official said Thursday shortly after the release of a damning report. ""We have been guaranteed that we will have full access to anywhere we would wish to go,"" Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Valerie Amos told reporters after delivering to the Security Council the report. ""We will want to concentrate on those places where there have been reports of fighting so that we can see for ourselves exactly what is going on."" The mission will last three or four days, during which the group anticipates being accompanied by a representative of the Syrian Red Crescent, she said. Rashid Khalikov of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will lead the mission, she said. ""It's an initial mission and we would hope to go back in to do detailed assessments."" She added, with diplomatic understatement, ""There is continued concern about the humanitarian situation."" That concern was raised in the Fact-Finding Mission on Syria, whose report concluded that Syria is guilty of human rights violations in its months-long crackdown on protesters and that it may be time for the International Criminal Court to get involved. ""The mission found a pattern of human rights violations that constitutes widespread or systematic attacks against the civilian population, which may amount to crimes against humanity,"" the report said. The violations include murder and disappearances, torture, deprivation of liberty and persecution, it added. The U.N. mission, which was set up by the Human Rights Council in late April, issued its 22-page report Thursday covering mid-March to mid-July. ""Both the armed forces and the security forces are involved in the suppression of peaceful protests and related violations across Syria,"" the report says. ""Many of the victims and witnesses interviewed by the mission identified the heads of the security and intelligence branches in their governorates or cities as having ordered the commission of human rights abuses, including summary executions, arbitrary arrests and torture."" Among the steps it demands Syria take: ""end impunity, including by abolishing legislation which grants security and intelligence personnel virtual immunity from prosecution."" The report called on the U.N. Human Rights Council to urge the U.N. Security Council to ""address in the strongest terms the killing of peaceful protesters and other civilians in Syria through the use of excessive force and other grave human rights violations; to call for an immediate cessation of attacks against the civilian population; and to consider referring the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court."" The Security Council was briefed Thursday on the matter by Amos, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay; and a U.N. political officer. Pillay said the report concluded that ""the abuses and human rights violations going on on the ground undermine the proclaimed reform package,"" and that she had recommended Syria be referred to the International Criminal Court ""because all the evidence produced by the commission's report support a finding of widespread and systematic violations of human rights -- equaling crimes against humanity."" After the Security Council met, representatives from Britain, France, Portugal and Germany said they would support a resolution to heighten pressure on Damascus. ""We believe that the time has come for the council to take further actions to step up the pressure against those who are responsible for the violence against the citizens of Syria,"" said Ambassador Philip Parham, charge d'affaires of Britain's mission to the United Nations. Germany's representative said his country has asked for an emergency meeting Monday in Geneva, Switzerland, of the Human Rights Commission. He added that the draft resolution will ask for an independent inquiry into the situation by the commission. The session may extend into Tuesday, said Cedric Sepe, press officer at the Officer of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Rosemary A. DiCarlo, U.S. Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said the United States would support a resolution that would include sanctions against Syria for its crackdown on peaceful demonstrators. ""We must again call for an immediate end to the violence, call for unhindered and sustained access for humanitarian and human rights workers and the media, and we must take collective measures against the Assad regime,"" she said. Syrian Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari lashed out at the charges as untrue and unfair. ""It is really pitiful to see these influential countries in the council making use of the council as an instrument to fulfill their illegitimate strategies against my own country as well as against the whole area,"" he told reporters outside the Security Council. Ja'afari then ticked through what he said were other untruths that resulted in wars -- the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that gave then-President Johnson authorization to send U.S. troops to Vietnam, the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by Cuban exiles and the alleged weapons of mass destruction that U.S. officials proffered in 2003 as justification for the war in Iraq. ""All the invasions that were taken on behalf of the Security Council were based on lies,"" Ja'afari said. ""Since when, and under which international laws, can a member state claim that the president of this country or that country is legitimate or not?"" he asked rhetorically. Ja'afari said that al-Assad has issued 20 reforms since March that will lead toward democracy in Syria by the end of the year. ""This is, after all, what the peaceful demonstrators are calling for,"" he said. The goal of the United States is to instigate further violence in the country, he said. The fact-finding mission's report came as U.S. and European leaders called for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down. ""The future of Syria must be determined by its people, but President Bashar al-Assad is standing in their way,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement. ""His calls for dialogue and reform have rung hollow while he is imprisoning, torturing and slaughtering his own people. ... For the sake of the Syrian people, the time has come for President Assad to step aside."" British, French, German and Canadian leaders backed Obama's call, as did representatives of the European Union. U.S. authorities imposed new economic sanctions against Damascus on Thursday, freezing Syrian government assets in the United States, barring Americans from making new investments in Syria and prohibiting any U.S. transactions relating to Syrian petroleum products, among other things. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States ""will take steps to mitigate any unintended effects of the sanctions on the Syrian people."" Switzerland became the latest nation to recall its ambassador from Syria. Al-Assad and his regime have repeatedly denied allegations of violations against civilians, insisting that any military efforts have been against ""armed gangs"" and ""terrorists."" Al-Assad told U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that military operations have stopped, the United Nations said Wednesday. But anti-government protesters on Thursday accused Syrian forces of rounding up opposition members in the hard-hit port city of Latakia. Security personnel clad in black raided homes in Latakia's al-Ramel district, making arrests in an ongoing military crackdown against protesters calling for al-Assad's ouster, two witnesses said. Opposition members reported seeing security forces take up positions in and around a handful of cities. Throughout the protests, the Syrian government has repeatedly said it was already taking key steps toward political and social reform. CNN cannot independently confirm reports by witnesses, the opposition groups or the government because Syria refuses to allow international journalists to enter the country. The opposition assertions are based on reports from organizers, witnesses and medical professionals, who have been speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear for their safety. The unrest in Syria, part of a wave of protests across much of the Arab world, began in March with mass protests following the arrest of teens for scrawling anti-government graffiti. The protests quickly grew into a larger movement calling for free elections and an end to the reign of al-Assad, whose Alawite-minority led government rules Sunni-majority Syria. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a loose coalition of groups that documents and organizes protests, puts the number at 2,545 people who have died since the protests began. The vast majority were civilians, and 391 were security personnel, the group said. CNN's Joe Vaccarello, Joe Sterling, Alan Silverleib, Nada Husseini, Elise Labott, and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","Mission urges Security Council to consider bringing case to International Criminal Court .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich's hopes of taking a record lead into the Bundesliga's winter break were dented by a 1-1 draw at home to Borussia Monchengladbach on Friday. The result left Jupp Heynckes' team 12 points clear at the top after 17 rounds, but second-placed Bayer Leverkusen can reduce that to nine by winning at home to Hamburg on Saturday. Borussia Dortmund set the record of a 10-point halfway lead in 2010, but the third-placed defending champions can only close the gap to 11 by winning at Hoffenheim on Sunday. Bayern, who won a record opening eight matches of this season, had hoped to put on a show to match the planned post-game ""thank you"" party for the 71,000 fans at the Allianz Arena, but Gladbach killed the mood by taking the lead in the 21st minute. Thorben Marx fired home from the penalty spot after Bayern defender Jerome Boateng handled a cross by Tolgar Cigerci in the visitors' first real attack of the match. Bayern drop points in Dortmund draw . ""I don't know how the referee could class that as a penalty,"" Boateng told reporters. ""I seriously don't think it was justified. I think we deserved to win."" Bayern lost $52 million August signing Javi Martinez to injury before halftime, but it was the Spanish midfielder's replacement Xherdan Shaqiri who netted the equalizer. Heynckes -- who was born in Monchengladbach and also played for and managed the club -- also brought on last season's top scorer Mario Gomez for his early-season replacement Mario Mandzukic just 11 minutes after the break. Germany striker Gomez, who missed three months with injury, helped make space for Shaqiri -- who took advantage of a slip by Marx to fire in a left-foot shot at the near post just before an hour's play. It was the 21-year-old Switzerland international's first Bundesliga goal since signing from Basel in preseason, though he had netted in the Champions League earlier this month and in the German Cup in August. Gladbach held on to move up to sixth place as Bayern dropped points for just the fourth time this season, having lost only once. Bayern will begin the four-week winter break following Tuesday's German Cup last-16 trip to Bundesliga strugglers Augsburg on Tuesday. The match may be a further test for Mandzukic, who scored nine league goals before Gomez returned from ankle surgery in mid-November -- but none since. Gomez, who matched the Croatia forward's three goals at Euro 2012, has netted three times in seven appearances since his return.","Bayern Munich fans denied winning celebration ahead of Bundesliga winter break .

"Editor's Note: David Hawkins is Director of Public Policy and Research for the National Association for College Admission Counseling, a nonprofit organization that represents more than 11,000 high school counselors and college admission officers from across the country. He was the author of a report last month by the organization's commission on the use of standardized tests. David Hawkins says test scores shouldn't be used to rank college quality . ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- A recent controversy at Baylor University has brought new attention to the widespread misuse of standardized college admission tests to rank the quality of America's colleges and universities. The SAT and ACT have achieved nearly iconic status in America and throughout the world. As the late author and scholar Stephen Jay Gould noted, the tests are viewed by many as ""abstruse and mysterious,"" with powerful effects on public policy, social mobility, and even individual identity. Misuse of test scores as college ranking criteria creates undue pressure on admission offices to pursue increasingly high test scores and fuels the tests' disproportionate influence. Last June, Baylor University encouraged its already admitted first-year students to retake the SAT. The reward for students who retook the test was $300 in bookstore credits. Students who increased their score by more than 50 points got a $1,000 merit aid scholarship. If enough students retook the SAT and increased their scores, the gains might be enough to move Baylor up the rankings list. The scarce financial resources allocated for this plan are too badly needed elsewhere, particularly among low-income students in rural and urban areas around the country, to spend on an effort to raise a college's SAT profile. A Baylor spokesman told The Associated Press Thursday that the university ""goofed"" and would likely end the incentives. It's critical to understand that high SAT and ACT scores alone do not equate to merit. Last month, our organization's Commission on the Use of Standardized Tests in Undergraduate Admission issued a report calling for change in the way everyone involved in college admissions uses the tests. Test misuses feed the public perception that the scores are the most influential factor in college admission. For the past 15 years, National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC) research has shown that students' grades in high school, particularly grades in college preparatory courses, are by far the most important consideration in college admission decisions. One of the most pressing problems regarding the SAT and ACT scores is their misuse in the U.S. News and World Report college rankings formula. The SAT and ACT were designed to provide information about a student to colleges and universities and were never meant to be measures of college quality. Accordingly, the commission encouraged U.S. News and World Report to eliminate test scores as a measure of institutional quality. The U.S. News ranking formula includes a ""student selectivity"" score that constitutes 15 percent of a college's overall rank. SAT or ACT scores of enrollees make up 50 percent of the student selectivity score. In response to the NACAC report, U.S. News and World Report said, ""As long as standardized tests play an integral role in the college admissions process, U.S. News will use them as part of our ranking methodology."" The situation at Baylor is a reminder of the inflated value assigned to the SAT and ACT in higher education. The fervor surrounding the rankings, as well as the lengths to which colleges go to increase them, are unfortunate distractions in higher education and admissions. The impression students and families get from the rankings is that higher test scores mean higher quality colleges. To borrow a phrase familiar to admission deans, many colleges recruit great students and then graduate great students. Is that because of the institution, or the students? Some credit undoubtedly should go to both. But is a college of lower quality because its students' SAT scores are lower than those of students at another college? Generally speaking, the ability of admission tests to predict success in higher education is much more limited than most people think. Colleges most often determine the utility of admission test scores by assessing how well they predict first-year grades. Colleges are wrong to place so much emphasis on test scores as measurements of their institutional worth when admission offices across the board consider the scores to be one among many indicators of a student's merit. As influential as the rankings have been with students and families, is it any wonder that colleges whose stakeholders often demand higher ranks go to such lengths to influence their position in the rankings? Misuse of test scores has real ramifications for students and families. For every student able to afford test-performance tutoring and fees for taking the test many times, there are many qualified students from under-served backgrounds who become discouraged that they will be unable to compete. For every college that raises its SAT or ACT profile for rankings purposes, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of qualified students who will never apply because artificially inflated test scores signal yet another barrier to higher education.

"United Nations (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday issued a statement condemning the Syrian government's crackdown on protesters and calling for an immediate end to violence by all parties. ""The Security Council expresses its grave concern at the deteriorating situation in Syria, and expresses profound regret at the death of many hundreds of people,"" the eight-paragraph statement says. It further calls for ""all sides to act with utmost restraint, and to refrain from reprisals, including attacks against state institutions."" The statement says those responsible for the violence should be held accountable but offers no suggestion that foreign intervention is being considered. ""The Security Council reaffirms its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Syria,"" it says. ""It stresses that the only solution to the current crisis in Syria is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process, with the aim of effectively addressing the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the population which will allow the full exercise of fundamental freedoms for its entire population, including that of expression and peaceful assembly."" Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he welcomes the statement. ""The world has watched the deteriorating situation in Syria with the most profound concern, but the events of the past few days have been brutally shocking,"" he told reporters. ""Once again, I call on President (Bashar al-) Assad and the Syrian authorities to immediately cease all violence against their people, to fully respect human rights and implement reforms that they have already announced."" He further urged Damascus to comply with the Security Council's demand that international humanitarian organizations be granted unimpeded access to affected areas. ""Those responsible should be held to account,"" he said. He praised the 15-nation Security Council for speaking out ""with one voice and condemning all this violence and asking them to take necessary measures"" after long discussions on the matter. But Lebanon's ambassador, Caroline Ziade, said her country, which is Syria's neighbor, dissociated itself from the statement. However, Lebanon chose not to block the measure, as it could have done. Though a resolution would have been more significant than the presidential statement approved Wednesday, U.S. diplomats said they are glad the United Nations has taken a stance.

"United Nations (CNN) -- Iran continues to evade and violate a U.N.-imposed arms embargo, according to a sanctions committee report released Friday to the Security Council. Ambassador Tsuneo Nishida of Japan, who is the chairman of the committee, told the Security Council that within the past 90 days, the committee has been investigating two separate incidents of reported Iranian violations. One violation, he said, involved a report by a member country that from one of its ports, it ""inspected and seized 13 shipping containers of illegal arms reportedly originating from Iran."" The committee said it would issue a more comprehensive report of the results in the near future. The other report of violations involved a separate member country whose customs and border authorities seized a container onboard a ship which originated from Iran and was destined for Syria. It contained ""a high-potential explosive known as 'T4' or 'RDX'. "" Susan Rice, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, reacted to the report saying, ""Unfortunately, when it comes to Iran's actions, not much has changed since we last met. Iran continues to violate its obligations"" to the Security Council. In 2007, Security Council Resolution 1747 imposed a ban on the export and procurement of all arms and related material from Iran.","Committee chairman says panel is looking at two reported incidents .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Chinese villager has spent almost $320,000 on constructing six floating survival pods that are built to withstand tsunamis, earthquakes and other natural disasters, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post has reported. The pods, weighing four tons each and consisting of two thick layers of fire-proof and shock-resistant carbon fiber, sit in Liu Qiyuan's yard in Qiantun, a small village in the northern Chinese province of Hebei. With December 21 looming, a date when some have predicted the apocalypse would occur, the bizarre contraptions have attracted a huge amount of attention, but Liu told The South China Morning Post that his motivation for building them went further back. While the Hollywood disaster movie '2012' and the 2004 Asian tsunami were factors, Liu said he ultimately made the decision to build the pods after his village was swept by doomsday rumors in the early 1990s. Despite assuring his young daughter that the end was not nigh, Liu said the girl asked him to build an indestructible house. Now, Liu is making good on that promise. The airtight spheres have varying interiors, but they all come with oxygen tanks and seatbelts, and each is equipped to hold about 14 people. They are designed to remain upright when floating in water. Some people in his village thought he was crazy when he began construction in March, and both his daughter and wife tried to talk him out of the project. But Liu is hoping that governments and international organizations will adopt his pods and use them in natural disasters. ""Men don't just live to make money,"" the South China Morning Post quoted him as saying. ""My design could be used by cruise ships to save lives. If anyone survives a shipwreck with my device, I will call it a good investment.""","A Chinese villager has built six 'survival pods'

"(CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council on Sunday condemned the weekend massacre of more than 100 civilians in Syria, with members casting blame on government forces for the deaths, while violence continued to rage on the ground. U.N. military observers said the toll from the Friday assault on the village of Houla included dozens of women and children. After consultations Sunday afternoon, Security Council members condemned ""attacks that involved a series of government artillery and tank shellings on a residential neighborhood,"" as well as the killings of civilians by close-range gunshots and ""severe physical abuse."" ""Such outrageous use of force against the civilian population constitutes a violation of applicable international law and of the commitments of the Syrian government under United Nations Security Council Resolutions 2042 and 2043 to cease violence in all its forms, including the cessation of use of heavy weapons in population centers,"" said Azerbaijan's Deputy Ambassador Tofig Musayev, who presided over the meeting. The members demanded that Syrian troops immediately pull its troops and heavy weapons back from cities in accordance with an April cease-fire. Read Ban Ki-moon's letter to the Security Council . Bashar Jaafari, Syria's U.N. ambassador, told reporters the statement wasn't blaming his government for all the killings, since the statement left the cause of most deaths ambiguous. He said most of the deaths were caused by gunfire, and the council statement did not specifically assign blame for those fatalities. And Russia, a longtime ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, believes ""it still remains unclear what happened and what triggered what,"" as Russian charge d'affaires Alexander Pankin put it. But German Ambassador Peter Wettig said there was ""clear evidence"" connecting the government to the deaths. ""The evidence is not murky, and there is a clear footprint of the government in this massacre,"" Wettig said. And Martin Brines, the French deputy ambassador, said a briefing by the head of the U.N. observer mission in Syria ""clearly shows the responsibility of the Syrian government in failing to protect its civilians as well, as attacking them directly."" U.N. observers in Syria said the toll from the Houla massacre had risen to 108 on Sunday, including 34 women and 49 children under the age of 10, said Sausan Ghosheh, the observer mission's spokeswoman. Horrific images of the bodies in Houla spread across the internet, fueling fresh protests by Syrian opposition groups in several cities. Videos posted Sunday on YouTube show demonstrations in cities around the country, including Damascus, Daraa, Idlib, and the suburbs of Hama. ""Oh Houla, we are with you until death,"" protesters chanted in Daraa. And a demonstration in Idlib showed a U.N. vehicle among protesters. In the Hama suburbs, demonstrators called for President Bashar al-Assad to step down. But the 14-month-old clampdown continued, with opposition activists reporting another 51 people -- including 11 children and four women -- killed across the country on Sunday. Twenty-five of those deaths took place in Hama, where heavy shelling was reported, they said. Opposition activists said killings began with a mortar bombardment following Friday prayers, followed by a rampage by government-allied militias. Video posted over the weekend showed opposition activists displaying the bloodied remains of more than 10 children, including some with limbs blown off or skulls torn open. In another, medics treated a crying infant whose chest was covered in bandages. Syria has denied its troops were behind the bloodbath in Houla, and Jafaari denounced what he called a ""tsunami of lies"" against his government. He called the deaths ""an appalling, horrific unjustified and unjustifiable crime"" and vowed Syria's government had launched a national commission to investigate them. ""Whoever committed these crimes will be held accountable by the Syrian authorities, by the Syrian government's law,"" he said. In state-run media, the Syrian regime said ""al Qaeda-linked terrorist groups committed two horrible massacres against a number of families in the towns of al-Shumariyeh and Taldo in the countryside of Homs province."" The state report also showed gruesome images of children spattered with blood. CNN can not independently confirm details from Syria nor the authenticity of videos, however, as the Syrian government strictly limits access by foreign journalists. But Alex Thomson, a reporter for Britain's ITV television network who was in Houla, said its residents appeared to be voting with their feet. ""There are lots of civilians in the rebel-held areas. They are not apparently frightened of the fighters. They are speaking openly to the United Nations,"" Thomson told CNN. ""In the areas of the town held by the army, there is nobody -- it's a ghost town."" U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay called for the situation in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court. ""There should be an immediate and unfettered investigation of the incident by an independent and impartial international body,"" she said. ""The Syrian government has a legal and moral responsibility to fully assist such an investigation, and to take concrete steps to prevent any similar acts."" The New York-based Human Rights Watch similarly demanded an investigation and echoed the call for the U.N. Security Council to refer Syria to the ICC. Citing survivors to the violence in Houla, the group reported that armed men dressed in military clothes attacked homes and executed families, though witnesses did not know whether the men were members of the army or a pro-government militia. The group recounted the experience of a 10-year-old boy, who saw his 13-year-old friend shot. The Syrian crisis began in March 2011, when peaceful demonstrations modeled on the ""Arab Spring"" uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt sprang up across Syria. Al-Assad's government responded by turning police and troops on demonstrators -- but the protests spread across the country, with defecting soldiers taking up up arms on behalf of the opposition. A cease-fire agreement, brokered by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's office, has been in place since April 12 as part of a six-point peace plan. But Col. Qasim Saad Eddine, a spokesman for the rebel Free Syrian Army, said Saturday that it was ""no longer possible to abide by the peace plan"" after the Houla killings. U.N. officials say more than 9,000 people, mostly civilians, have died and tens of thousands have been uprooted since the uprising began in March 2011. Opposition groups report a death toll of more than 11,000 people. Sunday's Security Council session came a day ahead of a scheduled meeting between Syrian officials and Annan, the joint U.N.-Arab League special envoy on the crisis. Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary William Hague was headed to Moscow for talks in hopes of putting Russian pressure on al-Assad. ""We have had many differences of view with Russia at the Security Council, but Russia does support the Annan plan,"" Hague said in a statement from his office. ""And so I hope Russia will redouble its efforts to get the Assad regime to implement that plan. It's not in the interests of Russia, just as it's not in the interests of anybody in the world, for Syria to descend in to an even bloodier situation and into full scale civil war and that is now the danger."" A U.N. report issued Friday said Syrian forces are still using heavy weapons in many areas despite the April cease-fire, and ""The overall level of violence in the country remains quite high"" despite the presence of U.N. monitors. Monitors have heard the sound of shelling in cities and towns and seen the aftereffects, their report states, while Syrian authorities say they were coming under fire from rebel troops. Meanwhile, opposition groups effectively control ""significant parts of some cities"" the monitors state. But the government's stepped-up security crackdown ""has led to massive violations of human rights"" by Syrian troops and pro-government militias, the report states. The United States joined the condemnation of the Sunday afternoon. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said the United States was horrifed by ""credible reports"" of the massacre, ""including stabbing and ax attacks on women and children."" ""These acts serve as a vile testament to an illegitimate regime that responds to peaceful political protest with unspeakable and inhuman brutality,"" Vietor said in a written statement.","More than 50 people are killed throughout Syria on Sunday, opposition activists say .

"Washington (CNN) -- No employees of NBC will face criminal charges over the display of a high-capacity ammunition magazine on a ""Meet the Press"" program in violation of local law in Washington, prosecutors told the network on Friday. The capital city's attorney general, Irvin Nathan, said in a letter to NBC there would be no charges, but added that it was ""a very close decision."" Nathan also said ""there is no doubt of the gravity of the illegal conduct in this matter, especially in a city and a nation that have been plagued by carnage from gun violence."" The letter also confirmed the 30-round magazine displayed by show host David Gregory on December 23 was empty. At the time, Gregory was interviewing Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association, a strong opponent of new gun control proposals. Nathan said the network used the magazine with the ""purpose of informing an ongoing public debate about firearms policy"" not long after the school shooting massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. Even an empty magazine violates city law. Conviction carries a possible sentence of up to a year in jail as well as a possible fine of up to $1,000. A police spokeswoman said that NBC asked before the program whether it would be legal to show a high capacity magazine on air and was told no. An official with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives told CNN he consulted with city police after receiving a similar request from NBC and was told an empty magazine would not be a problem. The official passed the information to NBC, but later learned there was a ""miscommunication"" with police and that showing an empty magazine would, indeed, violate the law. The official said he did not give NBC permission to use a magazine. In his letter, Nathan referred to ""feeble and unsatisfactory efforts"" made by NBC to find out what it could legally do. ""Although there appears to have been some misinformation provided initially, NBC was clearly and timely advised by a (Metropolitan Police Department) employee that its plans to exhibit on the broadcast a high capacity magazine would violate D.C. law, and there was no contrary advice from any federal official,"" Nathan said. He added that any uncertainty about the law was unjustified. ""Meet the Press"" issued an e-mailed statement following Nathan's decision. ""We displayed the empty magazine solely for journalistic purposes to help illustrate an important issue for our viewers,"" the show said. ""We accept the District of Columbia Attorney General's admonishment, respect his decision and will have no further comment on this matter.""","'Meet the Press' host displayed empty high-capacity ammo clip on air .

"Washington (CNN) -- Twenty-three days since they last met face-to-face and 23 days before the fiscal cliff becomes a harsh reality, the two men most pivotal to the contentious budget talks sat down Sunday. There was no evidence of a breakthrough, though President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner at least did agree on something: what, and what not, to say. Sunday's White House meeting caught some by surprise, considering it had not been on the president's official schedule and the two sides have been sparring publicly, accusing each other of failing to work sincerely toward a compromise. After the talks ended, White House spokesman Josh Earnest and Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck issued identical statements. ""This afternoon, the president and Speaker Boehner met at the White House to discuss efforts to resolve the fiscal cliff. We're not reading out details of the conversation, but the lines of communication remain open."" The statements didn't give much insight into developments on the effort to prevent the U.S. government from going over the fiscal cliff, the term referring to the widespread automatic tax hikes and spending cuts that will take effect in January without a deal. On Sunday, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde echoed numerous economic experts in predicting a sharp drop in confidence and ""zero"" U.S. economic growth if there's no agreement. But the two political camps' matching words were remarkable, given what they have been saying about each for weeks. Last Friday, for instance, Boehner reported ""no progress"" and accused the White House of having ""wasted another week."" ""There are a lot of things that are possible to put the revenue that the president seeks on the table, but none of it's going to be possible if the president insists on his position, insists on 'my way or the highway,'"" the Ohio Republican told reporters. Obama has held his ground, especially on his insistence that tax rates return to 1990s' levels for families with incomes higher than $250,000, while they'd remain the same for those making less than that. After campaigning against any tax increases, many top Republicans have expressed willingness since the election to raise revenue by adjusting deductions and loopholes. But Boehner and others have said any revenue hikes must be packaged with major spending cuts, including reforms to entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. And they've resisted any tax rate hikes -- including for the wealthiest Americans -- as part of any deal. There have been some public departures from that thinking however. On Sunday, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee said he'd support raising taxes on the top 2% of households, arguing it will better position Republicans to negotiate for larger spending cuts to Social Security and Medicare despite opposition from many Democrats. ""A lot of people are putting forth a theory, and I actually think it has merit, where you go ahead and give the president ... the rate increase on the top 2%, and all of a sudden the shift goes back to entitlements,"" Corker said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Corker is not entirely alone, as fellow Republican Sens. Tom Coburn, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe have said they could vote for such a limited tax hike. There have been fewer higher-profile voices express that opinion in the House, though. One of them, Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, reiterated Sunday that he could go along with this scenario. ""You have to do something, and doing something requires the cooperation of the Senate, which the Democrats run, and the signature of the president,"" Cole said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" But one of his colleagues, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, said the Republicans shouldn't budge. Despite the loss of Republican seats in the House and Senate, Blackburn argued voters affirmed support for the GOP on Election Day and ""clearly said we don't want our taxes to go up."" ""The president thinks he has momentum, I think he is running on adrenaline from the campaign,"" the Tennessee lawmaker told CNN. This story was reported by Jessica Yellin, CNN's chief White House correspondent, in Washington and written by Greg Botelho in Atlanta.","President Obama and House Speaker Boehner meet at the White House .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If there was a most wanted list for climate change culprits, coal-fired power stations would be number one. Protesters camping near the site of a proposed coal-fired power station in Kingsnorth, England. Burning coal contributes half of the excess carbon dioxide (CO2) polluting the earth's atmosphere, a statistic not lost on the hundreds of climate change protesters camping in a grassy field near Kingsnorth power station in Kent, England this week. Power company E.ON is planning to build a new coal-fired power plant on the site, subject to approval by the British government later this year. It's one of four power stations on a UK government shortlist to trial the country's first commercial-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The International Energy Agency estimates CCS could reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by more than 85 percent. Protesters at the Climate Camp concede that if CCS technology was available now and could be fitted to the proposed power station then ""maybe we'd look at it."" So what is CCS? Carbon Capture and Storage refers to the process of stripping carbon dioxide from fossil fuels before or after they're burnt to produce energy. The carbon dioxide is then piped back into the earth to a depth of at least 800 meters -- deep enough for the pressure of the earth to keep it in a liquidized form where it stays for thousands, if not millions, of years. Where is it stored? Depleted oil and gas reservoirs are currently the most practical place to store large volumes of carbon emissions. More research would have to be done on other alternatives including deep saline aquifers and deep coal seams. Stuart Haszeldine, Professor of Geology at the University of Edinburgh says there's no shortage of potential storage sites. ""You need the pairing of a porous reservoir overlayed and sealed by a lid of impermeable mudstone or salt rock, which is even better. That's actually very common worldwide."" Why isn't it being done? Well, it is being done, but only a small scale. Trials are underway in a number of countries including Norway, Algeria and Australia. Last week, Australia's national science agency, the CSIRO, announced plans to test China's first post-combustion capture (PCC) technology at a pilot plant in Beijing. The problem is that while the different processes needed to capture and store carbon dioxide have been around for years, no one has brought them together on a large enough scale to cope with the volume of emissions from a typical power plant. And then there's the cost... Professor Haszeldine estimates that if a new power plant costs $1.5 billion to build, it'll cost an extra $700,000 to fit the capture equipment on the first experimental plants. In theory, the extra cost could be added to consumers' electricity bills but in a competitive power market how many customers would be willing to pay an environmental premium for their electricity and gas? Would you pay more for 'greener' power? Sound off below . ""It's a very immature economic market,"" says Ian Phillips, director of infrastructure at CO2DeepStore, a UK-based company dedicated to the commercialization of carbon storage. ""The people who might do the industrial scale-up -- the power stations -- have no economic incentive,"" he says. Show me the money . Aside from government subsidies and investment by companies and private parties, an obvious way to fund the change is through cap and trading schemes. Europe's Emissions Trading Scheme is the world's largest for greenhouse gas. It works like this: Energy companies are given strict limits as to how much carbon dioxide they can emit each year. If they exceed the limit or cap, they have to buy more. In 2014, the system is set to change. Energy companies will have to buy all their emissions permits, so from then on any company that stores some or all of its CO2 won't have to pay. If only it was that simple... ""The problem is that the price of maybe €35 ($54) or €40 ($62) per ton of carbon dioxide will not be enough to fund the gap in the extra estimated cost of these new power plants,"" explains Professor Haszeldine. ""There has to be a role of member state governments to bridge that gap. In principle that's possible because the government will receive the income from dirty power plants who will have to buy their emissions. What they need to do is take some of that income and give a grant or subsidy to those first experimental power plants."" The theory is that as CCS techniques become more efficient, the cost of capturing carbon will come down so that from around 2020 it will become cheaper for companies to store carbon than to emit it. Is it really the way to go? Environmentalists are wary. Friends of the Earth says it's happy for CCS technology to be tested as long as it doesn't divert attention and funds away from developing renewable energy. ""We are all accepting that a demonstration of CCS is reasonable -- you keep your options open in a situation of urgent global need,"" says Neil Crumpton, adding, ""CCS in our view would be mainly a stop gap or a transition technology while we build solar technologies."" So it is dangerous? In a word, no. Geologists are confident the C02 won't escape from sites approved for storage. Most of the underground vaults would be out at sea anyway. In some instances, the CO2 could be stored under residential areas, but strict licensing procedures and the need for constant, rigorous testing should allay fears. ""One could argue that in an emergency situation even if you keep most of the CO2 down for one to two hundred years, you've got yourself out of the danger zone, even if it does begin to leak,"" says Neil Crumpton. Professor Haszeldine says the environmental cost of not doing it could be catastrophic. ""The risk of not doing it is that the world continues to put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels whether it's coal or gas or oil. The consequences of not doing it are absolutely catastrophic to ocean ecosystems and to the climate system of the world as we know it."" Have your say. Is CCS the way to go?

"(Oprah.com) -- A businesswoman, a mother of four, an international fashion icon, a woman committed to making the world a better place for women and children -- Queen Rania of Jordan is truly changing the world. Queen Rania says cultural dialogue, education and increased opportunities are ways to combat terrorism. Rania Al-Yassin was born in Kuwait. Shortly after Saddam Hussein invaded that country in 1990, her family fled and settled in Jordan. After graduating from business school, Rania began working her way up the corporate ladder. When she was just 22, she went to a dinner party where she met Jordan's Prince Abdullah -- considered one of the world's most eligible bachelors. He didn't remain one for long after that night. Six months later, Rania and Abdullah had a royal wedding and started a family. And, though they planned for a life as royals, Abdullah assumed he'd remain a military officer for life. In 1999, while on his deathbed, King Hussein of Jordan stunned his country by announcing that his son Abdullah -- not his brother -- would succeed him as king. That made 29-year-old Rania the world's youngest living queen. Rania says that being queen is not the trait she defines herself by. ""I am not at all conscious of it,"" she says. ""I make a conscious effort not to be conscious of it. Because I'm Rania, you know? People call me 'Queen,' but, you know, that's not me ... I'm Rania."" There are many perks to being queen, of course, but Rania stresses that there are also responsibilities. ""One of the major misconceptions about this position is that people think that I might be far removed, that I might not be in touch with reality,"" she says. ""The honest truth is that my life is very much about dealing with issues on the ground, dealing with ... the problems that our country faces. That's something I do on a daily basis.""  Watch how Queen Rania uses technology to reach young people » . When most people think of queens, they probably think of what they know from fairy tales. ""For me, it's just real life,"" Rania says. ""I am a mother. I care about my children. I worry about what they eat. I worry about the influences from their friends."" Rania is not only sitting royalty in Jordan, she's raising the next generation of royals too. She is the mother of four children -- 14-year-old Hussein, 12-year-old Iman, 8-year-old Salma and 3-year-old Hashem. Rania says her family tries very hard to remain down to earth. The family has relaxed much of the ceremonial pomp and circumstance of their position. Rania prefers that people not refer to her as ""Your Majesty"" ... and King Abdullah loves to barbecue! The family never discusses the possibility that Hussein, their oldest child, could be the future king of Jordan, Rania says. Instead, she says the family strives to remain like any other family. For instance, to get the things they want, the children have to clean their rooms and do well in school. ""The most important thing is to instill them with the right values,"" Rania says. ""I just feel that values are the shield that you carry with you throughout life. It protects you from whatever life throws at you."" Rania has become famous around the world for her efforts to improve educational opportunities for girls and the rights of women. ""In my mind, poverty is a 'she,'"" Rania says. Helping others is something Rania says she feels compelled to do. ""Once you feel that others are like you, then you want for others what you want for yourself,"" she says. ""And that way you start helping others."" Rania explains that there is a direct relationship between increasing education and eliminating poverty. ""You can change the course of a nation through education,"" she says. ""One of the most important things you can do for a girl is empower her with her education. Once she has the education, she can then have control over her income, she can change her life, she can have choices."" To understand what life is like for the women in Rania's kingdom, ""The Oprah Show"" spent a day with a few women in Amman, the capital city of Jordan. One woman named Muna worries about striking a balance between work and motherhood. Part of that means preparing lunch -- the most important meal in Jordanian culture -- for her family. Unlike in America, most children and husbands return home to eat with their families for lunch. Just like in America, Muna cooks a variety of meals, everything from traditional Arabic food to hamburgers and spaghetti. In this largely Muslim country, one religious tradition is increasingly a matter of choice. Approximately 60 percent of Jordanian women wear a veil. Though Queen Rania says she has never worn a veil, she understands why a woman would want to. ""We think it's a personal choice,"" she says. ""Unfortunately, in the West, people look at the veil as a sign of oppression or weakness. This is not true as long as a woman is wearing it because of her belief. I always say we should judge a woman according to what's going on in their heads rather than what's going on top of their heads."" Rania says that when people focus on differences between cultures -- especially stereotypes and things like veils -- they fail to realize just how similar all people are. ""Once you go beyond the mannerisms, the language, the cultural idiosyncrasies, you realize that you're basically the same, you know?"" she says. Rania also wants to break down the stereotypes the West holds about her culture. ""I would like to dispel the misconception that Arabs are all extremists, that Arab people are violent and that women in the Arab world are oppressed and suppressed,"" she says. The struggle we feel today is not really Middle East against the West, Rania says, but rather it is between extremists and moderates of all religions. ""We need to speak up,"" she says. ""The biggest nightmare for the extremists is for us to get along, and that's why we have to get along. We have to communicate more."" In the future, Rania says she hopes for a more open and secure world. ""We look at problems happening halfway across the world and we think, 'Well, that's their problem.' But it's not,"" she says. ""When you solve somebody else's problem, you're solving a problem for yourself because our world today is so interconnected."" Rania says solving problems that stem from intolerance -- like terrorism -- require cultural dialogue, education and increased opportunities. ""We have to create opportunities for our youth so they have a chance in life,"" she says. ""Whenever you're frustrated and you feel like you don't have a future or you can't get a job, then you're more susceptible to be influenced by terrorism and extremist ideology.""

"(CNN) -- A series of bombings killed dozens and left more than 100 wounded in northern Iraq on Wednesday in violence that seemed targeted at Kurdish government officials. Death tolls and details varied about the attacks in Kirkuk. Police said the attacks, including a suicide bombing near the offices of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, left 27 dead and more than 100 wounded.

The oil-rich Kirkuk, about 20 kilometers north of Baghdad, has been the scene of tensions recently. It is also one of the disputed areas in the country between the central government and Kurdistan regional government. At the end of last year, relations between Prime Minister Nuri al-Malik's government and the Iraqi Kurds seemed to deteriorate further. The Iraqi central government and the Kurdistan regional government have been at odds for years over who has final authority over Iraq's vast oil wealth. In November, Iraqi Kurdistan deployed troops and tanks to cement the Kurds' claim over the strategic city. This launched a tense standoff with units of the Iraqi army, which had been deployed to areas near Kirkuk. In other incidents, five people died in mostly Shiite areas of Baghdad on Wednesday. Much of the violence targeted police officers. Gunmen shot dead three on patrol in the Shiite neighborhood of Shaab before setting their vehicle alight. An additional 10 people were wounded elsewhere in Baghdad in roadside bomb attacks. A mother and daughter were fatally shot when gunmen stormed their house in a Shiite neighborhood.","NEW: Violence in Baghdad targets police officers, kills mother and daughter .

"(CNN) -- They're calling it the ""Crews missile."" Fired from the keyboard of 67-year-old Nick Crews, the missive blew the lid off his dysfunctional family. In an e-mail titled ""Dear All Three,"" published in U.K. newspaper The Telegraph, Crews excoriates his three grown children for their professional and personal failures and for the ""bitter disappointment each of you has in your own way dished out"" to him and his wife. Crews, a retired British naval officer, was fed up with his children's unsuccessful marriages and inability to earn a living that, as he said, measures up to their potential. ""I for one, and I sense Mum feels the same, have had enough of being forced to live through the never-ending bad dream of our children's underachievement and domestic ineptitudes."" 5 ways to raise a grateful child . In the e-mail, made public with his permission by his daughter Emily, Crews describes his concern for his grandchildren. ""It makes us weak that so many of these events are copulation-driven and then helplessly to see these lovely people being so woefully let down by you, their parents."" And then this ultimatum: ""I want to hear no more from any of you until, if you feel inclined, you have a success or an achievement or a REALISTIC plan for the support and happiness of your children to tell me about."" Whoa. This is beyond disappointment. This sounds just plain mean. Yet, the story, and support for Crews, has gone viral. It ""struck a chord,"" wrote Telegraph reporter Cristina Odone. Sure, what parent doesn't fear raising a bum? But as the mother of two young adult children, I had to wonder whether a withering e-mail attack was the best way to go about getting the kids to shape up. I asked Dr. Gail Saltz, associate professor of psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine, whether the former submarine captain took the right tack. For a parent fed up with his child's behavior, ""It can be useful to do something shocking to get someone to take it to heart,"" said Saltz. But, she added, one must pave the way long before the children became adults, with a warm, communicative relationship. Although two of his children haven't spoken to him since receiving the note, ""Crews has been swamped with encouraging messages,"" writes Odone. Many are applauding Crews for ""telling it like it is."" But does he? In the e-mail, he alludes to his own mistakes: ""Having done our best, probably misguidedly, to provide for our children..."" He describes his envy when hearing his friends brag about their children, and seems deeply wounded by the fact that his children don't consult him or his wife before making life decisions. The secret life of my sixth grader . Perhaps he played a larger role than he would admit, or even knows, in how his children turned out. He did acknowledge to Odone that due to his naval career, he was pretty much an absentee father. The Crews story may sound frighteningly familiar to baby boomer parents. In the wake of the Great Recession, many parents have resigned themselves to the fact that their college-graduate children may not be moving out anytime soon and may not even have a job. A U.S. 2010 policy brief sponsored by Brown University showed that 43% of those under 25 live with their parents, up from 32% in 1980. But is the economy alone to blame for what I fondly call ""Deadbeat Kid Syndrome?"" ""Not everything is parenting and not everything is biology,"" said Saltz. ""There's a combination here."" And sometimes, she added, families just have bad luck. Saltz said although Crews obviously loves his children, ""he ended up missing the mark"" with the e-mail. Still, the fact that so many are rallying to his defense can be a positive thing, Saltz said, especially in a world full of ""overly indulgent parents,"" who aren't teaching children life skills. Everyone's tweeting and boasting about their kids' successes, but missing an important point, failure is important too. ""If you don't teach your kids any resilience, you fail them out of everything,"" Saltz said. ""They need to fall down, say I fell down before but got back up, and I know I can do that."" I'm guilty of this sort of thing. Growing up, I never once called my mother at work. Yet I allowed my own kids to call me all the time. It just took that much longer to wean them off the ""workday quickie advice call."" Perhaps I should have let them figure out mundane daily jams on their own. Many parents have blinders on. If you don't want your kids to end up with an entitled attitude, why lambast their teachers for giving them bad grades, which they likely deserve, or for failing them for cheating? When heroes disappoint our kids . Timothy Law Snyder is vice president for academic affairs at Loyola University Maryland and lectures nationally about generational differences. Snyder says some parents blame the school or the professor, rather than the student, for bad grades, even when their child is caught plagiarizing. ""It's at its worst when the parent is living through their child,"" he said. ""The parents' successes, even life accomplishments, are identified entirely with those of their child."" ""It used to be parents would go to the school and care that (their) kid has a moral compass and understands right and wrong,"" Saltz said. Nowadays, the concept of right and wrong isn't as clear. ""They're more concerned that the kid gets an A than be a kind person, a moral person."" Saltz said parents are under pressure for things to look good and feel good. ""They love their children. .... But they've got tunnel vision."" Case in point: when everyone who plays soccer gets a trophy no matter how well, or poorly, they've played. ""Children come out and experience nothing but success, not necessarily done by them but enabled by their parents, intervening all the time,"" Saltz said. Such intervention also creates a shortcut to adulthood, and that's not a good thing. Nor is having too many choices too soon. Take the beauty salon. How young is too young for a manicure? In my salon, there's a 4-year-old girl who's been getting ""mani-peds"" for two years. She loves the pedicure bath,"" the manicurist told me. What happens to that little girl when she grows up and can't afford manicures? And think, does your 6-year-old really need a cellphone? As for the Crews saga, Saltz said she hopes it makes a lot of people think about being more honest with their children. ""Someday they'll have to frustrate their child, disappoint their child, point out their child's mistakes. By doing those things earlier rather than later, they'll help their children to be better people."" Would you write a letter like Crews' to your children? Do you think such a message would be effective in changing behavior? Leave your opinion in the comments section below.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A Japan Airlines' inspection of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner involved in a fuel spill last week at Boston's Logan International Airport found a new leak from a nozzle on the plane's left wing, a JAL spokesman said Sunday. The leak was different from one that caused a flight on January 8 to be delayed by four hours, the airline said. The jet was bound for Tokyo on January 8 when a pilot on another airplane spotted the 787 leaking fuel just before takeoff. The ongoing investigation found a new leak in a nozzle used to remove fuel. The new 787 Dreamliner has been the subject of negative publicity after a string of recent mechanical and other problems. Troubles dating back just four months include reports of an oil leak, a fuel leak, engine cracks and a damaged cockpit window. This all follows a very difficult development history that included a series of production setbacks and other delays before the plane entered service in 2011. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which is responsible for air safety, launched a comprehensive examination on Friday of the Dreamliner's design, manufacture and assembly. Dreamliner safety review: What it means for fliers . More than 150 Dreamliner flights occur daily, according to Boeing. United Airlines -- which has six 787s -- debuted the nation's first domestic Dreamliner routes last November with much fanfare. Ray Conner, the head of Boeing's commercial airplanes unit, said Friday that Boeing is convinced of the aircraft's safety and that the airlines that have bought the plane are also confident in its safety. ""These planes are safe,"" he said. ""We welcome any opportunity to further assure people outside the industry."" Worldwide, Boeing has delivered 50 Dreamliners. Several hundred are under order, making its success crucial for Boeing, which had not designed a new commercial jetliner in years before unveiling the Dreamliner. The twin-engine jetliner is heralded for its mostly carbon fiber construction, which reduces weight. Its fuel-saving possibilities, cutting edge technology, operational versatility and cabin appointments generated enormous interest from airlines, initially overseas. One passenger said Friday he would avoid flying on a 787 for the time being. ""I am wary of a plane model that has fire problems and leaks fuel,"" said Atlanta-based businessman Bobby Burns, a project manager who takes more than 50 trips a year. ""I think of it the same as a new car model: wait a year or two to get all the 'recalls' sorted out."" A week Boeing would like to forget .

"(CNN) -- Geneticists have begun studying the DNA of Connecticut gunman Adam Lanza, a spokeswoman for the University of Connecticut Health Center said Thursday. The geneticists were asked to join the investigation by the state medical examiner's office, spokeswoman Carolyn Pennington told CNN. She said there is no specific genetic marker the team is looking for, and that lab results and a complete analysis of the DNA ""are not expected for several weeks ... probably the end of January."" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said it is unlikely investigators will be able to find a genetic clue for what motivated Lanza, who fatally shot 26 people, including 20 children, in the attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14. Lanza, who had also killed his mother before the school massacre, took his own life with a gunshot to the head. Newtown: No more gifts, please . ""There's no clear-cut sort of ... genes identified with the types of illnesses, mental illnesses, that may cause this sort of behavior,"" says Gupta. Not only that, Gupta said, but ""there are people who carry these genes who don't have the behavior still. I think it's very hard to sort of put those two things together."" Experts in genetics agree. Although there are genetic components to many mental illnesses, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of genes involved. Most believe that no single gene or mutation could be the smoking gun that foretells violent acts like those committed by Lanza. ""There's nothing you could look at that would give an answer,"" said Steve Warren, chairman of the Department of Human Genetics at Emory University. ""We don't know a gene that says 'this person has schizophrenia.' There's no way to come up with a conclusion that way."" Opinion: Predicting mass killings impossible .

"(CNN) -- The sun was barely up when New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg used the Colorado massacre to scold President Obama and Mitt Romney for ignoring the gun issue. ""This is a real problem. No matter where you stand on the Second Amendment, no matter where you stand on guns, we have a right to hear from both of them concretely,"" Bloomberg argued. Bloomberg challenges Obama, Romney to take action on guns . He has a point -- gun policy is a back burner debate these days, largely because Democrats who had pushed for tighter gun laws concluded it's bad politics. After the 1999 Columbine shooting, Democratic Vice President Al Gore played a central role in trying to pass ill-fated gun control legislation. On the campaign trail during his 2000 presidential run, he argued for ""common-sense gun safety measures."" Democratic strategists said they believe Gore and other Democrats lost critical votes in rural America by pushing for stricter gun laws. So, Democratic Party leaders began to recruit candidates who could win those largely red districts and states, candidates who ran on support for gun rights. Jim Manley worked in the Senate for more than 20 years as a top aide to Democrats Sen. Ted Kennedy and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. He witnessed the change up close. ""Democrats finally figured out that this was an issue that they were getting walloped on in many Western, Southern states and many swing states,"" Manley said. ""So they began a subtle shift to try to coordinate and/or get more pro-gun Democrats to run."" ""For many Democrats, it's smart politics not to get into the gun control debate,"" he said. Obama on shooting: This isn't a day for politics . So, even though President Bill Clinton signed an assault weapons ban in 1994 with fanfare, it lapsed in 2004 without much of a fight. Even after major tragedies shoved the gun issue into the headlines, there was some talk, but little action. Romney calls for unity after Colorado shooting . The 2007 Virginia Tech massacre resulted in a minor change: beefing up background checks for the mentally ill. Last year's assassination attempt of then-Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Arizona, produced only a few calls to make high-capacity magazines like those used in that shooting illegal. ""There is no earthly reason for these weapons to have that kind of bullet capacity,"" argued Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, one of the few remaining anti-gun stalwarts. But Senate Democrats wouldn't hold a vote, and Giffords' Republican colleagues in the House said at the time new laws were useless. ""Bad guys are going to get guns, they're going to get clips and they're going to do bad things,"" Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, said then. In fact, the Democratic-led Senate hasn't voted on any gun legislation in three years, since defeating a GOP measure that would have required states to recognize each others' gun laws. Why? Many still point to the National Rifle Association . Spokesman: NRA tweeter was 'unaware' of Colorado shooting . ""The NRA is an extremely powerful organization and they deliver votes and they deliver money,"" said Manley, who now works for QGA, a public affairs group in Washington. In the wake of the Colorado movie massacre, the NRA issued a statement steering clear of gun politics. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and the community. NRA will not have any further comment until all the facts are known,"" said Andrew Arulanandam, the NRA's director of public affairs. Because gun issues are not at the forefront of the political debate, the NRA's clout isn't talked about as much as it was in the 1980s and 1990s, when gun policy was a hot topic. But the NRA is still active and not afraid to throw its weight around on topics that even tangentially involve gun policy. For example, earlier this summer the NRA warned vulnerable House members that it was watching their vote on whether to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt over the failed ""Fast and Furious"" gun-walking operation. NRA Executive Director Chris Cox has said his group supported the contempt vote because of the Justice Department's ""obstruction of congressional oversight of a program that costs lives in support of an anti-gun agenda."" At the end of the day, of those seeking re-election who voted in favor of contempt, more than half are listed in competitive districts by the Cook Political Report and rely on conservative support -- including endorsements and cash from the NRA -- to survive their tough political battles. The NRA has reported more and more contributions to Democrats in recent elections -- from $236,330 in 2008 to $373,500 in 2010 --- still far less than the $911,250 the organization gave to Republicans that year. When it comes to presidential politics, the NRA and the Obama campaign both know full well that he could win or lose re-election in battlegrounds like Virginia and Ohio, where the NRA has significant sway over some swing voters. That's why the president is trying to heed the lesson of Gore and not go there when it comes to gun control. That hasn't kept the NRA from mobilizing members against him. ""When we're done speaking out, sir, gun owners will have made the difference in key precincts in battleground states,"" NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told the organization's meeting in April. ""You'll have us to blame for your defeat in November,"" he said, rallying the crowd. CNN's Allison Brennan contributed to this report.","Bloomberg: ""We have a right to hear"" from Obama and Romney on guns .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In a first for Manchester United, the English professional football club today announced major sponsorship deals with not one, but two, popular Chinese companies -- each in a three-year deal. While the value of those agreements have not been revealed, Chinese beverage giant Wahaha will become Manchester United's first official soft drinks partner in the country. China Construction Bank, the country's second largest bank by market value, will be the club's first deal with a Chinese financial institution. Wahaha, based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, says it has been China's biggest beverage maker over the past 11 years. Its bottled water, energy drinks and yogurt are ubiquitous from the urban markets of Beijing and Shanghai to rural stalls in the snowy mountains of the Tibetan plateau. ""Wahaha is one of the most iconic brands in China ... what better way to endorse this modern-day success story than to partner with the number one club in the world's biggest sport,"" said Richard Arnold, Manchester United's commercial director, in a news release. Arnold added that the football club has had a long association with China dating back to 1975 with the club's first friendly match in the country. Under the second deal, China Construction Bank gains exclusive rights to market the official Manchester United-branded credit card in China. CCB says it will start advertising the product to its nearly 102 million personal banking customers. ""In 80 major cities in China, CCB have almost 60% of all branches, making them the ideal partner to connect with our fans,"" said United's Arnold. ""Financial services products give us tangible ways of providing real benefits to our fans that enable them to establish a closer relationship with their favorite team."" United's Chinese sponsorship deals are just the latest in a series of at least a dozen agreements with global brand names in 2012 as the club has tried to pay down debts from a 2005 takeover. Most notably, last year the club signed a $559 million sponsorship with Chevrolet for a seven-year shirt agreement. In November, the club said its current debt stood at more than $640 million. After Manchester United's two Chinese sponsorship deals were announced, its share price on the New York Stock Exchange rallied 5.23%, peaking in intraday trade to a record high.","Man Utd announces major sponsorship deals with two popular Chinese companies .

"Editor's note: Michael C. Dorf is Robert S. Stevens Professor of Law at Cornell Law School and co-author (with Laurence Tribe) of ""On Reading the Constitution,"" and the author of ""No Litmus Test: Law Versus Politics in the 21st Century."" A former law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, he blogs at Dorf on Law. Michael Dorf says judges have a big leg up in dealing with complex Supreme Court issues. (CNN) -- With the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, President Obama has hit the trifecta: As a summa cum laude graduate of Princeton and an editor of the Yale Law Journal, Judge Sotomayor clearly has the intellectual chops to handle the work of the high court. Born and raised in a Puerto Rican family in the South Bronx, Sotomayor's personal story is an inspiring tale of personal achievement. And as someone originally appointed to the federal district court by the first President Bush, she will be perceived as, and in fact is, a moderate liberal who should easily win confirmation by a Democratic Senate. The nomination will nonetheless disappoint some critics who worry that every justice, including Sotomayor, if confirmed, will have come directly from the federal appellate bench. None of the current justices has ever held any major elective office. Yet former politicians have served with distinction on the Supreme Court. Sandra Day O'Connor was a state legislator. Hugo Black was a U.S. senator. Earl Warren and Charles Evans Hughes were governors. And William Howard Taft was president before becoming chief justice. It is not difficult to see why political experience would be very valuable for a Supreme Court justice. The issues with which the court deals frequently have political ramifications, and some legal tests incorporate elements of public opinion. For example, in determining whether some punishment is constitutionally barred as ""cruel and unusual,"" the justices ask whether it comports with society's ""evolving standards of decency."" Experience going before the people in an election would be useful in gauging public values. Accordingly, presidents in recent years have sometimes flirted with the idea of naming a politician to the Supreme Court. President Bill Clinton was prepared to nominate former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. Harriet Miers was not an elected official, but her experience in politics appealed to President Bush, until her nomination was scuttled by questions about her qualifications and ideology. Obama was rumored to have considered Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm for Justice David Souter's seat. In the end, however, every vacancy on the court since O'Connor's appointment in 1981 has been filled by a sitting federal appellate judge. Why? Part of the answer is that a federal appeals court judge has already been confirmed by the Senate once, and so is unlikely to have skeletons in the closet. But the deeper reason may be that so much of the work of the Supreme Court is extremely technical. Consider a case decided earlier this month involving allegations by taxpayers that their tax consultants had given them faulty advice, thereby subjecting them to penalties owed to the IRS. As the case reached the Supreme Court, the issue presented was this: ""Does Section 16(a)(1) of the Federal Arbitration Act confer appellate jurisdiction over an appeal from a motion to stay proceedings under Section 3 of the FAA when appellants are non-signatories to the arbitration agreement?"" Serving as an elected official is unlikely to prepare someone even to understand, much less provide an informed answer to, that sort of question. Questions of the sort just described make up more than half of the work of the Supreme Court. To say that they are ""technical"" is not to say that they do not involve real people or that they lack any political overtones. For example, just today, the court divided 5-4 along ideological lines over the seemingly technical question of whether a state law that barred state court jurisdiction over certain categories of cases could also be applied to bar a lawsuit arising under federal law. The ideological split no doubt resulted from the fact that the liberal justices, who gained a majority in the case, are more sympathetic to civil rights lawsuits than the conservative justices are. But without a thorough grounding in the minutiae of the law governing jurisdiction, a justice would not even know where to begin in such a case, regardless of his or her values. Thus, Obama's statement that he would look for Supreme Court nominees with empathy for their fellow human beings must be understood in context. The president never said that empathy was a sufficient quality for a Supreme Court justice. Rather, the ability to understand the human consequences of decisions about seemingly technical legal questions enables a judge to achieve justice within the framework of the law, but only if he or she first has a thorough grasp of that framework. That prior step of technical expertise is itself essential. It is possible for a legally trained politician to get up to speed on the law's technical dimensions and serve as a competent or even great Supreme Court justice. But if one is looking for a predictor, nothing beats distinguished service on a federal appeals court. When one adds to that Sotomayor's compelling story and her work as a prosecutor, private practice lawyer and trial judge, it is easy to see why the president decided that his best choice for this appointment was to think ""inside the box."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael C. Dorf.","Michael Dorf: Sonia Sotomayor pick is strong on personal, professional grounds .
He says some had hoped Obama would pick someone not an appellate judge .

"(CNN) -- Like most aspects of his life, the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was shrouded in secrecy. Though the reclusive nation revealed little about his well-being, speculation about him -- and about who would succeed him -- in the rest of the world intensified in recent years as reports of his failing health circulated. Kim died of a heart attack Saturday, according to North Korean state-run media agency KCNA. Kim had been on a trip and had suffered ""great mental and physical strain,"" said a broadcaster who choked up as she made the announcement Monday. The KCNA report blamed his death on ""overwork."" ""The heart of Kim Jong Il stopped beating, but his noble and august name and benevolent image will always be remembered,"" according to a message on KCNA's website. Kim had received treatment for cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases, according to KCNA. His father, Kim Il Sung, whom he succeeded in 1994, also died of a heart attack. The elder Kim died at 82. Kim was believed to have had a stroke in 2008, and the intelligence community subsequently speculated about his health. A July 2009 report released by WikiLeaks revealed that U.S. officials in South Korea believed that Kim's health was failing and that he was ""unlikely to live more than three to five years."" In recent years, Kim had grown frailer, appearing in public with a thinner frame and gaunt cheeks. There were even rumors that he had pancreatic cancer, much to the chagrin of North Korea, which accused the West of meddling and exaggerating his medical status. In the West, he was routinely mocked for his penchant for monochromatic outfits, large sunglasses, his platform shoes (he was 5-foot-2) and his roundness. But his weight had another meaning. He was purported to have indulged his taste for finer things in life, with a fondness for Hennessy cognac, while hundreds of thousands of North Koreans starved to death during his 17-year rule. North Korea has been struck by food shortages, because of natural and man-made problems, leading to mass starvation. In the 1990s, floods and economic troubles triggered a famine. The North Korean regime said that almost 250,000 people died between 1995 and 1998, but some outside groups say the death toll was 10 times higher. The country continues to face chronic economic problems, crop failures and food shortages.","Health of North Korean leader was shrouded in secrecy .

"(CNN) -- Ghana's election commission announced Sunday night that the West African nation's president won re-election, though the main opposition party says it has ""credible evidence"" the results were manipulated. In a statement streamed live on the Internet, Electoral Commission Chairman Kwadwo Afari-Gyan declared ""John Dramani Mahama president-elect"" after securing 50.7% of the vote. Nana Akufo-Addo, the candidate for the New Patriotic Party (NPP), garnered 47.7% of the vote, according to the commission. ""We must celebrate together as Ghanaians and refrain from anything that will derail the peace and unity we have enjoyed over the years,"" Mahama told supporters after the result was announced. But reiterating claims made earlier that the vote had been ""manipulated,"" the New Patriotic Party issued a statement it has ""credible evidence (that) undermines the integrity of the electoral process and the results."" ""Substantial discrepancies have been discovered from results from coalition centers when compared with the official tally,"" the party said on its website. ""Considering the closeness of the polls, this error is very significant and goes to the heart of the credibility of the results."" Ghanaians voted Friday and Saturday for a president and 275 parliamentary seats. According to the government's website, nearly 11 million citizens -- or about 80% of registered voters -- participated. Mahama is a member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC). Preliminary results reported by Ghanaian news outlets indicated Mahama was narrowly leading Akufo-Addo, the son of a former president. That contradicted what NPP General Secretary Kwadwo Owusu Afriyie had said Saturday night, when he claimed Akufo-Addo had won the presidency with 51% of the vote. The discrepancy prompted hundreds of NPP supporters to hit the streets Sunday to protest what their leaders describe as election fraud. Dressed in party T-shirts, they marched to the nation's Electoral Commission office chanting, ""We want peace,"" according to the state-run Ghana News Agency. ""The results have been manipulated on so many levels,"" party spokesman Yaw Buaben Asamoa said. Jake Obetsebi-Lamptey, the NPP's chairman, had called -- without success -- for Sunday's official announcement of results from the election commission to put off until ""all the allegations have been investigated."" He said tens of thousands of votes were added to Mahama's tally ""following collusion"" between National Democratic Congress and election officials, Ghana News Agency reported. The NPP has asked Ghana's electoral commission to recount the vote and conduct an audit of voting machines ""to help establish the credibility and accuracy of this year's presidential election. ""This in my view would assist considerably to allay public anxiety, which is growing hour by hour and due to the announcements being made in the Ghanaian media,"" Obetsebi-Lamptey wrote in a letter released by the party. ""It would also obviate any legal and protracted judicial proceedings on the issues and permit the resolutions of our concerns promptly, to enable due declaration to be made."" NDC General Secretary Johnson Asiedu Nketia told reporters his party was not yet responding to the NPP claims, expressing faith well before Sunday night's announcement by Ghana's election commission that Mahama was ""moving towards victory."" Unlike its neighbors, Ghana has held successful elections and power transfers since 1992 without descending into bloody chaos. The electoral commission initially said it expected to declare the winner within 72 hours after polls closed Friday. Passions are running high, and the president urged candidates to ensure that their supporters avoid incitement. ""Ghana has organized five previous successful elections, and there should not be any reason why this year's election should not be successful,"" Mahama said in a statement. Voting was extended into Saturday in areas where election materials arrived late or glitches with a new biometric identification system caused delays. Observers from the Economic Community of West African States noted some discrepancies and problems with voting procedures but described the vote as ""generally peaceful and transparent."" Ghana is one of Africa's fastest-growing economies. It is the world's second-largest cocoa producer, after Ivory Coast, and the continent's second biggest gold miner, after South Africa, according to the United Nations. But critics say that despite the rich resources that bring billions of dollars annually, the wealth is not trickling down to the rural poor who live on the land where the gold is mined. Ghana was among the first African countries to gain independence from the British, breaking loose in 1957. It endured a series of coups before Lt. Jerry Rawlings took power in 1981. A decade later, it transitioned to a stable democracy with multiparty elections.","NEW: Opposition party says it has ""credible evidence"" of problems .

"Louisville, Kentucky (CNN) -- Wilson Perez believes his father's killer is one of the hundreds of stable workers who live and care for horses in an area known as the ""backside"" of the Churchill Downs horse racing grounds. ""I imagine he's wandering around here,"" Wilson Perez told CNN in an exclusive interview first aired on ""Erin Burnett OuFront"", near the barn where his father's body was found. ""It has to be someone who lives here because no one else can come in."" Louisville Police investigators have released few details about the death of 48-year-old Adan Perez. Police say Perez's body was discovered around 5 a.m. Sunday morning by barn workers, just several hours after the final races of Kentucky Derby Day. The body was left in Barn No. 8, which backs up to the backstretch of the famed Churchill Downs horse racing track. The ""backside"" of Churchill Downs is made up of dozens of barns that house more than a thousand horses. It's also where some 600 stable hands live. It's a secluded and often overlooked world. It's home to the transient workers of the horse racing industry. Most workers are Central American immigrants who move around the country looking for work with stables and trainers. ""The outside world doesn't see this world. They don't know what the backside of the racetrack is like,"" Churchill Downs chaplain Ken Boehm said. ""It does concern us that there's someone back here or there could be someone back here still that could commit such an act."" Police say there are no suspects in the slaying of Adan Perez but are looking into several altercations that occurred at the track. Wilson Perez said he last heard from his father around 11:30 p.m. Saturday night. Both men talked on the phone for several minutes at the end of a hard day's work during the Kentucky Derby. ""He called me to see how I was doing and where I was,"" Wilson Perez said. This was almost a daily routine for both men. Father and son worked in different barns on the Churchill Downs grounds and could go most of the day without seeing each other. ""He told me he was outside (the racing grounds) at a restaurant with friends,"" Wilson Perez added. ""Everything was normal, like every time he called me. He never told me there were any problems."" Wilson Perez said he hasn't heard any stories of his father getting into any altercations the night of the murder. He also said he never heard his father talk of having enemies or having any problems with anyone around the grounds. Wilson Perez first walked through the gates of Churchill Downs two years ago. He had convinced his father to let him leave home in Guatemala and find work in the barns caring for horses. Adan Perez worked for horse trainer Cecil Borel, the brother of three-time Kentucky Derby-winning jockey Calvin Borel. Wilson Perez said he wanted to leave Guatemala to get closer to his father, who had been working in Kentucky since 2008. ""I asked him to bring me here,"" said Wilson Perez. ""I wanted to be with him."" The backside of horse racing tracks is the forgotten side of the horse racing grounds. It's an area that highlights the stark class structure of horse racing. It's where you see millionaire horse owners standing shoulder to shoulder with stable hands who roughly earn between $250 and $800 a week for a variety of jobs caring for the prized horses. ""Such a mash of people back here, the richest of the rich, the poorest of the poor and everyone in between,"" said Boehm, who ministers to the stable hands. But it's also a secluded and difficult world for outsiders to penetrate. Workers often move around the country, from horse track to horse track following the work wherever it goes. Boehm said on any given day there are about 600 people who live on the backside of Churchill Downs. They can live on the grounds for free, but the workday usually starts early. Around 4 a.m. workers start cleaning the stables and feeding horses. Other workers prepare the horses for their daily workouts on the racetrack. Boehm hoped stable workers who might have information about Adan Perez's slaying won't be reluctant to come forward. ""I'm hoping someone will say something, if not to me, to a trainer or to a friend that they become comfortable with,"" he said. Wilson Perez said he still loves the work at Churchill Downs. In fact, since his father's death he's kept working through the pain and anguish even as he makes arrangements to get his father's body sent home to Guatemala for a burial. Wilson Perez said he doesn't want to return to Guatemala; he wants to keep working at Churchill Downs. ""He was a good father,"" Wilson Perez said. ""Everything he knew; he would pass on to me.""","Victim's son thinks his father's killer is one of Churchill Downs' stable workers .

"Washington (CNN) -- Efforts to strengthen Native American communities and improve their relationships with the federal government have already borne fruit, President Barack Obama told a group of leaders from more than 500 federally recognized tribes Thursday. ""We're making progress,"" Obama said at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, the second of his administration. ""We're moving forward. What I hope is, we're seeing a turning point in the relationship between our nations."" He said he wants to hear more from tribes about how that can be done, whether it's through supporting education and health care on reservations, combating crime or job creation, ""and that's why we're here today."" Leaders of 565 tribes were invited to the conference, the White House said. The president said his administration has tackled some of the largest issues faced by American Indian communities, helping to create infrastructure, eliminate bureaucratic barriers and boost public health on reservations, where tribal members face rates of diseases like tuberculosis at a far higher rate than the rest of the nation. The Justice Department, he said, is working to reform the criminal justice system on reservations. The Tribal Law and Order Act, signed by the president in July, contains measures to help fight drug and alcohol abuse on reservations, gives authorities better access to databases and improves opportunities for at-risk Native American youth. American Indians' history has been ""too often marred by broken promises and grave injustices against the first Americans,"" Obama said. While he acknowledged that no words can undo the damage, he said his administration aims for action to match those words. Native Americans have been faced with a choice, he said -- abandon their heritage or accept a lesser lot in life. ""We know this is a false choice,"" he said. ""To accept it is to believe that we can't and won't do better, and I won't accept that.""","Obama hosts his second White House Tribal Nations Conference .

"London (CNN) -- A helicopter crashed into a construction crane atop a new luxury residential building in thick London fog Wednesday, killing the pilot and another person and sparking a line of flames as it plunged to the ground. Thirteen others were injured in the crash that took place near a busy intersection at the height of the morning rush hour in Vauxhall, south of the River Thames in central London. Thick smoke and flames billowed into the sky as traffic ground to a halt and emergency workers rushed to the scene, not far from landmarks like the London Eye and the Houses of Parliament. The bent crane dangled from the building top, prompting police to cordon off roads in the area and evacuate residents and office workers. Many watched, horrified, from the street and office windows as the drama unfolded. Watch: Crash sparks security fears . ""I was standing outside having a cigarette when I saw the helicopter flying super fast towards the crane,"" said Rezart Islami, a builder who was working across the road from the 52-story building. ""The pilot appeared not to have seen the crane because the helicopter hit it and went bang."" Islami said the rotor blade snapped off, and the copter spun to the ground and burst into flames. ""The top off the crane also came off in the impact,"" he said. ""It all happened so fast, it was unbelievable."" Another eyewitness recounted seeing rescuers pull three injured people from two burning cars. ""It is something of a miracle that this was not many, many times worse given the time of day,"" said police commander Neil Basu. Vauxhall, not far from Westminster, is where a new U.S. Embassy is being built. The area, which is a mix of industrial, business and residential use, is also home to the riverside headquarters of the UK intelligence service, MI6. Are you there? Send your pictures and video, but stay safe . Rotormotion, a helicopter charter company, identified the pilot as Peter Barnes, 50, a married father of two. ""He was one of the most highly qualified and highly skilled helicopter pilots in the UK, and his death is a great loss for the British aviation and his colleagues at Rotormotion,"" spokesman Paul Blezard said. ""The thoughts of all the staff are with this family and two young children at this dreadful time."" Barnes was the only person on board the helicopter, which was on a scheduled commercial flight from Surrey, southwest of London, police said. The second person killed ""was in close proximity"" to the helicopter, a London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said, but gave no more details. One of the injured was treated for a broken leg, but emergency responders said the others were not seriously hurt. Construction workers were at the site when the crash happened but were not hurt. James Whipps, a CNN producer, said the helicopter wreckage appeared to have landed on two cars by St. George Wharf, a major residential construction project. Watch: Eyewitness describes the scene . The St. George Wharf construction project includes the landmark St. George Wharf Tower, also known as the Vauxhall Tower. Its developers, the Berkeley Group, say it will be one of Europe's tallest residential towers. Whipps said he heard the sound of the helicopter rotors suddenly cut out. He did not see the impact, but as he looked though a window, he ""suddenly saw this enormous fireball, black smoke, shoot up from the side of a building."" Daniel Toledo heard ""a big noise"" while on his way to the nearby Vauxhall station. Though Toledo didn't see the helicopter at first, he took out his camera in time to shoot exclusive aftermath video for CNN. ""I look up, after the helicopter down,"" said Toledo. ""Big noise again. The helicopter is gone."" Watch: Fatal copter crash stalls London commute . Nicky Morgan, a member of parliament, heard the impact from the nearby Vauxhall station. ""There was an enormous bang and clouds and clouds of thick, black smoke,"" she told CNN. ""It was very surprising, not what you expect to see."" Despite the confusion, people remained calm, she said. Christopher Jen was at Vauxhall Tube station on his way to his marketing job when he spotted smoke rising nearby. ""We could hear all the sirens and you could smell the smoke as the train went past the site,"" he said in a submission to CNN's iReport. ""The station announcers did tell us that there was a helicopter crash at Vauxhall and the engineers had to go check the tracks before we could leave."" Reporters allowed through the cordons to the deadly crash scene say little can be seen other than a dark spot where the helicopter hit the ground. A Berkeley Group spokesman said the firm was giving its full support to the emergency services after its crane was hit. ""Our thoughts at this time are with the friends and families of those killed in this tragic incident,"" he said. Firefighters are now working with contractors to make the mangled crane safe. Prime Minister David Cameron thanked the emergency services for their ""rapid and professional response."" Poor visibility . Many helicopters follow the Thames as a flight route through the city. This helicopter appeared to be flying farther south than usual, Whipps said. No cause has yet been given for the crash, but visibility was poor in London on Wednesday morning, with fog and a very low cloud ceiling. Chris Yates, an aviation security expert, told CNN it was likely there would be questions about whether the helicopter should have been flying in these conditions. Under safety regulations, tall buildings must have navigation lights on top to make them visible to low-flying aircraft, he said. Helicopters are not supposed to fly within 500 feet of tall structures in central London, he said. The London Heliport is near the crash site, on the banks of the Thames, at Battersea. The Air Accidents Investigation Bureau, part of the UK Department for Transport, has sent a team to investigate the crash. The Civil Aviation Authority says helicopters in London have only limited radar help and fly mostly using visual reference points on the ground. Certain designated routes for helicopters are in place to ""provide maximum safety by avoiding flying over built up areas as much as possible,"" it says. Nearly 170 flights followed the central London route along the Thames in December, its figures show. About 250 flights arrived and departed from the heliport at Battersea in the same month. Wednesday's crash caused major disruptions for many people on their way to work. Vauxhall, with a rail station, Underground station and large bus station, is an important transit point for those traveling from the south to other parts of London. The Nine Elms area between Vauxhall and Battersea has been earmarked as a major regeneration site, with plans to create 16,000 new homes and 25,000 new jobs. CNN's Antonia Mortensen, Dominique Van Heerden, Sarah Brown, Saskya Vandoorne and Mark Morgenstein contributed to this report.","The pilot killed in the crash is identified as Peter Barnes, a married father of two .

"(CNN) -- State troopers arrived at the home of Tiger Woods on Saturday to interview the pro golfer and his wife about a car crash near his home but were told the couple was not available to talk as scheduled, a spokeswoman for the Florida Highway Patrol said. The troopers were asked by Woods' agent to postpone the interview until Sunday, spokeswoman Sgt. Kim Montes told CNN. She said she didn't know whether a reason was given. Troopers had also tried to speak to Woods on Friday as part of a routine car accident investigation, but his wife said he was sleeping, Montes said. Troopers decided they would come back Saturday afternoon. While Woods is required to show his license, registration and proof of insurance, he's not obligated by state law to give a statement on the crash. However, it's ""very unusual"" not to do so, Montes said. ""We simply want to ask why did he crash his car,"" she said, adding, ""All we're trying to do is get his side of the story."" Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, did not respond to requests for comment Saturday. Woods was treated and released from a hospital after suffering minor injuries in a car accident early Friday in his neighborhood in Windermere, a suburb of Orlando. A joint statement from Woods' publicist and Health Central Hospital said Woods was in ""good condition"" after the accident outside his home. Though they didn't interview Woods on Saturday, the troopers entered the luxury complex and started part of their investigation into the incident, Montes said. Investigators will seek possible surveillance tapes of the accident from Woods and his neighbors and review the 911 call from Friday, she said. The single-vehicle accident occurred about 2:25 a.m., according to a police report. Woods pulled out of his driveway in a 2009 Cadillac SUV and struck a fire hydrant, then a tree, the report says. Authorities have said they don't have details on why Woods was driving away from his home at such an early hour. Montes acknowledged there are questions surrounding the circumstances of the crash, saying, ""If this turns up something else, we'll go down that road. ... We're knee-deep in this now."" Police Chief Daniel Saylor on Friday said two Windermere police officers were the first to arrive on the scene. ""There was Tiger Woods laying on the ground in front of the vehicle with his wife over him rendering first aid,"" he told reporters. ""He was in and out of consciousness with lacerations to his upper and lower lip,"" Saylor said. ""He was mumbling but didn't say anything coherent."" Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren, told the police she was inside the house when she heard the accident. She said she went outside and used a golf club to break out the rear window of the vehicle, then pulled him from the SUV. ""According to the officers, yes, she was very upset,"" he said in response to a question. But, he added, ""Things like this happen all the time ... I understand he's stable and he's fine."" Cellphone pictures of the accident from CNN affiliate WFTV . Nordegren rode in the ambulance with Woods, who was treated at Health Central Hospital before he was released Friday, Montes said Saturday. Montes said both rear passenger windows of the SUV -- which was towed from the scene -- were shattered and there was damage to the left and right of its front end, resulting in $5,000 to $8,000 in estimated damages. She said the left side hit the fire hydrant, the right hit the tree. The accident was not alcohol-related, according to the police report. The 33-year-old golf phenomenon has won 14 major championships, only four shy of Jack Nicklaus' record. His 71 PGA tournament victories rank third all time behind Sam Snead and Nicklaus. Tiger Woods: A true sporting legend . He was set to host and play in the Chevron World Challenge on Monday at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California. Woods has won the tournament -- which helps raise money for Tiger Woods Foundation programs -- four times. Woods has won six times on the PGA tour this year after returning from knee surgery he underwent in 2008. In a post on his blog last month, Woods said he was ""absolutely thrilled"" about his play of late, adding, ""This has been one of my most consistent years on the PGA tour."" Woods and his wife have two children ages 2 years and 10 months.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Adele's vocal cords have healed from surgery in November, allowing the 23-year-old British songstress to perform on the Grammys stage next month, she and the Recording Academy confirmed Tuesday. Adele let the big news out in a tweet: ""Ima be, Ima be singing at the Grammys. It's been so long I started to forget I was a singer! I can't wait, speak soon xx"" Her ""recurrent vocal cord hemorrhage"" forced Adele to cancel her sold-out U.S. tour last October and she underwent laser microsurgery at Massachusetts General Hospital in November. ""I'm immensely proud to have been asked to perform at this year's Grammy Awards,"" Adele said in the official news release. ""It's an absolute honor to be included in such a night, and for it to be my first performance in months is very exciting and of course nerve-racking, but what a way to get back into it all."" There was uncertainty when the nominations were announced in late November if Adele's vocal cords would have healed enough to perform at the awards show, but it was clear producers wanted her. Adele, who's already won two Grammys, is nominated for six new awards, including for record of the year, song of the year and best short form music video for ""Rolling In The Deep;"" album of the year and best pop vocal album for 21; and best pop solo performance for ""Someone Like You."" Along with a ""welcome back"" to Adele, the 54th annual Grammys will include a ""goodbye"" performance by singer Glen Campbell. Campbell, 75, launched his ""Goodbye Tour"" last year after revealing he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.

"(CNN) -- 50 Cent's 2003 breakout hit is one of Piers Morgan's gym playlist staples. That's right: In the health club, CNN's Morgan listens to ""In Da Club."" ""No one is going to believe me when I say this,"" said Morgan. ""But I work out to that song. Literally, it's on my iPod. It's the top of my gym collection. And it never fails to get me going. It's one of the great workout songs ever."" Rapper 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, is a guest on Monday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" ""The problem with that kind of song, Piers,"" he said, ""is you've got to create something that's equivalent to it."" 50 Cent, 36, remarked that it's lucky that the iconic dance hit -- which appeared on his debut album, ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" -- contains the lyric ""It's your birthday,"" because ""every day is someone's birthday, so it's relevant all over again."" He also referred to the tune as ""the old reliable. If I can't move the crowd, put it on."" Morgan asked 50 Cent to take him back to what motivates him as an artist, namely the circumstances surrounding his upbringing in South Jamaica, Queens, in New York. 50 Cent lost his mother at the age of 8, never knew his father, and was raised by his grandmother. By the time he was 12, he was dealing drugs on the street. ""Even when I was standing on the corner, I was standing there with an entrepreneurial spirit. I was just standing there because there were no opportunities or options for me in that early stage,"" said 50 Cent. He admitted that there were a lot of ""negative influences"" on him during that period. Back in 2000, before his career skyrocketed, 50 Cent was shot nine times at point-blank range in his hometown. He credited that ""life-changing experience"" with inspiring him to focus on his music full-time. He said he also wanted to make sure his 6-year-old son, who is now 15, didn't take the same path. The shooting left 50 Cent with multiple injuries including a broken leg, cracked hip, and several shattered bones. He still has shrapnel in his tongue. ""I slur a little bit from time to time,"" 50 Cent told Morgan. ""But this is the new voice, the voice that works."" He said he actually sings better with the shrapnel, and that his voice prior to being gunned down ""was only strong enough to make people aware of me in the 10-block radius that I grew up in musically. And this voice is the one the world has embraced."" 50 Cent said he has since resolved to avoid violent situations, and aims to serve as a positive influence to his peers, fans, and young entrepreneurs. He recently took on the Street King energy project, which provides a meal to a child in need every time a bottle of the energy drink is sold. The rapper helped put together the project in conjunction with the United Nations and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. 50 Cent explained that the business model is similar to TOMS Shoes, which provides shoes to children in need. ""It's one for one,"" explained 50 Cent. ""Every bottle of this energy drink that's sold, a meal is being provided through the World Food Programme."" Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- The Sri Lankan government said Thursday it has made more inroads into the remaining territory held by ethnic Tamil Tiger rebels after troops seized their command center in the north of the country. Sri Lankan workers bury the bodies of some 38 suspected Tamil Tiger rebels killed in recent fighting. The defense ministry's announcement, also reported by the country's Lankapuvath national news agency, could not be independently verified. Military jets pounded the rebel's ""transit camp"" in the district of Mullaittivu Wednesday evening, the agency said. The defense ministry said rebels were firing at and killing civilians who were trying to flee the fighting. ""In the face of humiliating defeat, LTTE terrorists are tailoring a civilian tragedy,"" it said on its Web site. The LTTE, or the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, are commonly known as the Tamil Tigers. They have fought for an independent homeland for the country's Tamil minority since 1983 in a civil war has left more than 65,000 people dead. In recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds. Earlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula. It had been in rebel hands for more than nine years. The re-capture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea.","Sri Lanka news agency says government jets bombarded rebel transit camp .

"(CNN) -- Like many awards shows, buzz surrounding the Golden Globes has long focused on questions like who will wear what, who's on whose arm and who will win a statuette. But another critical question has emerged since Ricky Gervais first took the stage as the awards show's host in 2010: Which celebrity will get roasted? The British comedian caused quite the stir when he took jabs at Mel Gibson and Sir Paul McCartney at the 67th Golden Globes in 2010. Jaws again dropped in 2011 when he questioned the sexuality of ""some famous Scientologists"" before revisiting the troubled past of Robert Downey Jr. Judging by the 2012 event poster, which features the third-time host snipping off the gag that covers his mouth, Sunday's affair may be rife with Gervais' trademark barbs. Gervais has tweeted about his Globes game plan in the days leading up to the show: ""I keep having to write new jokes as I pick my victims, I mean targets, I mean presenters to introduce. Some great people have confirmed."" He even assured Twitter followers that he'll be drinking lager, ad-libbing and speaking his mind: ""No one knows what I'm going to say until I say it. That was my only stipulation to host again."" Though he's already been criticized for offending a slew of big-name celebrities and members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which runs the awards show, Gervais shouldn't -- and wouldn't -- consider toning down his act, said Gregory Ellwood, the editor-in-chief of HitFix.com. ""I think he actually feels empowered by the reaction every year,"" Ellwood said. Gervais recently told ""Today's"" Matt Lauer that, despite making such ""offensive"" jokes, he has no trouble sleeping at night. ""I think offense is taken, not given,"" he said. ""If you don't let yourself be offended, you're not offended. ... My conscience never takes a day off. Some people are just offended and you can't really worry about them."" Later in the interview, Lauer said the media have referred to the soon to be three-time host as a genius, prompting the comedian to let out a boisterous laugh. But Ellwood said Gervais is certainly something of the sort. ""It's not as easy to be outrageous and biting and funny at the same time as it might seem,"" Ellwood said, noting that Gervais has pulled it off twice already. ""His Sheen joke was comedy gold for me,"" Ellwood said referencing Gervais' quip about the former ""Two and a Half Men"" star's typical breakfast of partying and heavy drinking. ""He couldn't avoid it."" The rest of Gervais' material, however, wasn't so obvious. With the exception of jokes about Ashton Kutcher and, possibly, Katy Perry and Russell Brand, Ellwood says to expect the unexpected at the 69th Golden Globes. Unless the expected is a whole lot of industry jabs, that is. Ellwood said many of the jokes will most likely be at the expense of director Brett Ratner, who stepped down as Oscar producer after making an anti-gay slur, and Eddie Murphy, who made the decision not to host after the controversy. (Billy Crystal will host the event for the ninth time come February 26.) ""He'll rip the HFPA, Dick Clack Productions and NBC,"" who are involved in a legal row over the TV rights to the awards show, Ellwood said. Gervais went after the Hollywood Foreign Press Association last year when he insulted ""The Tourist"" stars Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. ""He wasn't really knocking (the actors). He was knocking the HFPA (for nominating the film) and then (Jolie and Depp) for showing up,"" Ellwood said. But, truth be told, Ellwood added, the association most likely wants Gervais to say something that will wind up at the water cooler the next day. Regardless of how many people Gervais offends in the process, he continues to rebuild the Globes' reputation after a disappointing show in 2008. A mere 6 million viewers tuned in that year, when the Writers Guild of America boycotted the event. In 2011, Gervais' biting humor helped reel in about 17 million viewers. What's working so well for Gervais had the opposite effect on controversial Oscar hosts David Letterman and Chris Rock, whose bits didn't sit well with critics, Ellwood said. Awards show hosts aren't supposed to insult people in the audience, he added. ""The way Ricky sees it, he'll never host the Oscars,"" Ellwood said. ""He takes it from that point of view, so he has no problem insulting people. There's no reason not to."" Gervais confirmed his no holds barred approach on his blog in December: ""I would say that there's nothing too offensive in there, but I honestly thought that last year. So I'm not sure of the rules anymore."" The comedian's advice for the easily offended? ""Don't worry about it.""","Gervais caused a stir when he took jabs at Mel Gibson and Sir Paul McCartney in 2010 .

"(CNN) -- Kyle Green, a University of Minnesota instructor, feels awful that he asked his sociology class to watch all three presidential debates. He should have checked the calendar first. Each of the debates this month, as well as the vice presidential showdown, falls on crucial game days. The fight for the hearts and minds of voters will be, in many households, a fight for the remote. ""I bet there are a lot of sports fans in my class who will be facing the same dilemma that I am,"" said Green, a rabid sports fan. When President Barack Obama takes on Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in their first debate Wednesday, Major League Baseball will be wrapping up its regular season. 5 things to watch in the first presidential debate . It's an especially important day for Yankees, Orioles, Rangers and Athletics fans as their teams vie for first place in their respective divisions. Eight days later, the October 11 vice presidential debate falls on the same day as the Thursday night football game between the Steelers and Titans. The NFL's ""Thursday Night Football"" has been delivering strong numbers this year, and last Thursday's Browns-Ravens game ranked first among cable TV programs for the night. When Romney and Obama face off a second time on October 16, they will compete with a Major League Baseball playoff game. Last year, an average of 7.1 million viewers watched a playoff game. And the final presidential debate on October 22 falls on a Monday during an NFL game between historical rivals the Detroit Lions and the Chicago Bears. Judging by past numbers, the debates will likely win out. Some 56 million people watched the final debate between Obama and Sen. John McCain on October 15, 2008. Average viewership for a typical Monday Night Football game is about 13 million. But the numbers don't speak to the anxiety some will feel Wednesday. New York actor Markus Potter, like many Yankees fans, is torn. The Yanks are trying to fight off the Baltimore Orioles to win the American League East championship. And the game will be in its final innings as the debate begins. 7-Eleven election accurately predicts presidential election winner . ""Always rough when presidential politics and baseball compete,"" Potter said. He says he'll have the TV tuned to the debate and his laptop to the game, switching his attention between the two. ""This just means I have to turn off the Twitter so nothing is given away in either game,"" he said. ""And yes, I do refer to them both as 'games.'"" Denver-area baseball writer Jonah Keri will be contending with a third distraction, albeit a pleasant one. Wednesday is also the birthday of his 3-year old twins. ""I will be lighting candles, watching the debate and the games at the same time,"" he said. ""I will have the computer and the TV going at the same time,"" he said. "" I imagine in this era of multitasking, many will be doing this."" Last month, the NFL rescheduled its season-opener to avoid competing with Obama's speech at the Democratic National Convention.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Millions of television screens reverted to black and white for a few minutes Sunday night as the 53rd annual Grammy Awards turned off the color for Bruno Mars. It was a section of the show that emphasized the connections current popular music has to the past, on a night with several music legends are teamed with new stars, including Barbra Streisand, Mick Jagger and Bob Dylan. Mars sang his hit ""Grenade,"" a performance that echoed back to the 1950s and Sam Cooke, or the 1960s and Otis Redding. Janelle Monae followed with a futuristic soul performance of her song ""Cold War,"" which brought the Staples Center crowd to their feet for a long standing ovation. Rihanna made a triumphant return to the Grammys, two years after she canceled her performance hours after she was beaten by then-boyfriend Chris Brown. Rihanna teamed with rapper Eminem to perform their ""Love the Way You Lie,"" a record of the year contender. As Rihanna sang the lyric ""I need a doctor,"" they were joined by Dr. Dre. It was Dre's first live television performance in over a decade. Eminen was later handed a Grammy for best rap album for ""Recovery,"" the best selling CD of 2010. Rihanna, who appeared to have recovered from her bout with the flu, also delivered a steamy rendition of her hit ""What's My Name"" with best new artist nominee Drake. Lady Antebellum took home five Grammys, including for song of the year, record of the year and best country album for ""Need You Now."" The group also was given two Grammys in the pre-telecast show. Jazz bassist and singer Esperanza Spalding beat out Drake and Justin Bieber to win the best new artist award. The show opened with a ""get-well card"" to Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin, who is recovering from an undisclosed illness. Yolanda Adams, Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride and best new artist nominee Florence Welch sang a soulful montage of Franklin's hits, including ""A Natural Woman,"" ""Ain't No Way,"" ""Knock On Your Door,"" ""Think,"" ""Baby I Love You"" and ""Respect."" Franklin did not attend, but instead a video message was played. ""I especially want to thank all of you who took the time to send me get well cards and flowers, beautiful flowers, and most importantly your prayers during my time of hospitalization,"" Franklin said. ""I wish I could have been with you tonight,"" Franklin said. ""But next year, OK?"" The star power from the past included Barbra Streisand, who sang her 1976 Grammy and Oscar winning song, ""Evergreen."" It was the theme song for ""A Star Is Born,"" the film in which she starred with Kris Kristofferson, who introduced Streisand. Mick Jagger paid tribute to songwriter Solomon Burke, who died last October, by singing Burke's ""Everybody Needs Somebody to Love."" The Rolling Stones covered the song on a 1965 album. Bob Dylan sang and played his harmonica with best new artist nominee Mumford and Sons and rising roots rockers, the Avett Brothers, in a salute to the comeback of acoustic music. A musical tribute to country legend Dolly Parton featured Nora Jones, Keith Urban and Jon Mayer singing her song ""Jolene."" Lady Gaga popped out of a giant egg on stage at the start of her performance of ""Born This Way,"" a song with a message about gay and lesbian rights. Gaga, who wore a raw meat dress on another red carpet last year, arrived inside the egg for the Grammys. Gaga was ""incubating,"" her creative director Lauri Ann Gibson said. ""It was necessary to incubate her for a certain time, because tonight she is actually birthing a new race,"" Gibson said. ""A new race that doesn't have the ability to judge or hate in their DNA, so she is incubating right now so she goes through that process."" Gaga, whose ""Bad Romance"" won her two Grammys during the pre-telecast show, was given the best pop vocal album Grammy during the telecast for ""The Fame Monster."" British alternative rock band Muse won the best rock album grammy for ""The Resistance."" Miranda Lambert won her first Grammy, taking home the best female country vocal award for her song ""The House That Built Me."" ""Thank you, and I love country music,"" Lambert said. Train won the first Grammy handed out on the telecast. It was for best pop duo or group performance with vocals. ""Thanks, Justin Bieber, for not being in a duo or a group,"" Train lead singer Patrick Monahan said, . A mini-tribute to the four-year career of the 16-year-old pop sensation included video of an even younger Bieber auditioning for his eventual mentor, Usher. Bieber sang a montage of three songs with Usher and actor Jaden Smith, the 12-year-old son of actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. Cee Lo revamped his hit ""F**k You"" into ""Forget You"" so he could perform the record of the year contender on the broadcast. He was accompanied by Jim Henson's Muppets and Gwyneth Paltrow. It was a colorful performance, strikingly reminiscent of Elton John's guest appearance on the Muppets. With 98 of the 109 awards presented pre-telecast, producers had plenty of time for entertainment during the 3 1/2-hour live show on CBS. Jeff Beck, John Legend and Jay-Z each won three Grammys in the pre-telecast presentations, while BeBe & CeCe Winans, the ""Crazy Heart"" soundtrack and Usher gained two trophies. Jazz legend Herbie Hancock added two Grammys to his extensive collection, one for improvised jazz solo and one for best pop collaboration with vocals. With 14 of the trophies on his shelf, Hancock told CNN winning them never gets old. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report .","NEW: Lady Antebellum wins 5th Grammy for the night .

"(EW.com) -- Last weekend, a dark cloud hung over the box office after the tragedy in Aurora, Colorado, rocked the country. The ""Dark Knight Rises"" still managed a stunning $160.9 million opening weekend — the third best of all time — but most believe it could have finished with substantially more money had audiences not been avoiding the theater. There's definitely still some tension in the air this frame, but movie going is expected to return at least somewhat back to normal. Two new openers are hitting theaters — sci-fi comedy ""The Watch"" and dance sequel ""Step Up Revolution"" — but they won't be any match for the second weekend of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Here's how the box office may play out: . Once again, The Dark Knight Rises will top the chart. The question is how hard it will fall in its sophomore frame. In 2008, The Dark Knight dropped 53 percent to $75.2 million in its second weekend, but Rises will be lucky to earn a similar drop. After six days in theaters, ""Rises"" is lagging behind ""The Dark Knight"" ($211.8 million vs. $222.2 million) despite a stronger start. On its first Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, ""The Dark Knight"" earned $24.5 million, $20.9 million, and $18.4 million, respectively. Rises, meanwhile, earned $19.4 million, $17.8 million, and $13.8 million. I see four possible reasons for this slighter performance: . •The shooting still has moviegoers wary to attend the theater — especially for ""The Dark Knight Rises."" •""The Dark Knight Rises,"" while well-received, is not earning the same amount of feverishly strong word-of-mouth that propelled ""The Dark Knight"" into the box office stratosphere. •""The Dark Knight Rises"" is playing like a typical sequel. They open bigger (in this case, only slightly bigger), but then fall much more quickly due to up-front fan excitement. •Hollywood collectively underestimated just how big of a box office bump Heath Ledger's death gave ""The Dark Knight."" That film's numbers were misleadingly inflated, and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was never destined to be a bigger box office powerhouse. Whatever the reason, ""Rises"" doesn't seem to be holding up quite as strong as ""The Dark Knight."" Thus, I'm thinking a drop in the 60 percent range is in store for Warner Brothers' $250 million Batman sequel. The Dark Knight Rises may gross $65 million over the Friday to Sunday period, which would lift its total right around $290 million. Fox's comedy ""The Watch,"" which once looked like a surefire hit, will likely invade second place with much less business than most prognosticators would have guessed six months ago. The film, which stars Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill, Vince Vaughn, and Richard Ayoade, tells the story of a volunteer police squad who seek to protect their neighborhood, but end up fighting off an alien invasion. The film, which was made for $68 million, has faced numerous marketing challenges due to controversial news events. Originally titled Neighborhood Watch, it got a modified title after the February shooting of Trayvon Martin by Florida resident George Zimmerman, a volunteer neighborhood watch officer. Fox was forced to play up the alien angle of the film instead of the regular-guys-shooting-guns storyline. The studio had largely kept any images of alien invasion out of their advertising after John Carter and ""Battleship's"" back-to-back flops, which had studios hesitant to associate themselves with intergalactic creatures. Despite the new tack, ""The Watch"" never fully shook the association with the Trayvon Martin scandal, and the Aurora shootings haven't helped in that department. Whether many regular moviegoers actually make these connections is unlikely. Still, these factors have consistently affected The Watch's marketing campaign, and as a result, it's been difficult for Fox to clearly communicate the story. Despite poor reviews, the movie features a three high-profile comedians in a year that's been kind to broad comedies. Playing in 3,168 theaters, ""The Watch"" may gross $22 million. The other new release is ""Step Up Revolution,"" the fourth installment of the popular dance franchise, which recently shifted from Disney to Summit. The $33 million sequel comes two years after ""Step Up 3D,"" which earned $42.4 million, substantially less than its predecessor, ""Step Up 2 The Streets,"" which grossed $$58 million. The diminishing returns may continue for ""Revolution,"" as the franchise seems to be teetering dangerously close to the quality level of long-running direct-to-video spinoff series like Bring It On and American Pie. Popping and locking into 2,567 theaters, Revolution could finish in the same range as 2004 dance flick You Got Served, which started with $16 million. ""Step Up"" has the benefit of 3-D screens, but those are only major box office boons for blockbusters these days. (If only the series still starred Channing Tatum!) It may earn about $13 million this weekend — but the real money will come internationally. ""Step Up 3D"" grossed $161 million worldwide. Rounding out the Top 5 will be Ice Age Continental Drift, which may earn about $13 million in its third weekend, and then either Ted or The Amazing Spider-Man, both of which should finish with about $6.5 million. 1. The Dark Knight Rises -- $65 million . 2. The Watch -- $22 million . 3. Step Up Revolution -- $13 million . 4. Ice Age: Continental Drift -- $13 million . 5. The Amazing Spider-Man -- $6.5 million .

"(CNN) -- The Emmys will be Sunday night at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles, and AMC, HBO and Showtime have nabbed a huge chunk of the major nods this year. This yet again sparks the question that has been looming around the industry for years: Is the quality of programming from the major broadcast networks on the decline? Numbers don't lie . When the nominations for the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards were announced, HBO received 104, the most of any network for the 11th year in a row. With multiple opportunities to win for ""Mildred Pierce"" (21), ""Boardwalk Empire"" (18), ""Game of Thrones"" (13) and the miniseries ""Too Big to Fail"" (11), the cable network (which is owned by CNN's parent company) is poised to show up strong at this year's awards. However, to be fair, major network comedies also received multiple nominations, including ABC's ""Modern Family"" (17); NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" (16) and ""30 Rock"" (13); and FOX's ""Glee"" (12). Still, it's hard not to notice the lack of major network dramas in that list. For some perspective, here is a breakdown of the most nominated networks for the 2011 Emmy Awards: . HBO: 104 . CBS: 50 . NBC: 46 . PBS: 43 . Fox: 42 . ABC: 40 . AMC: 29 . Showtime: 21 . Comedy Central: 11 . ReelzChannel: 10 . Major network nominations total 188, while cable television nominations earned a grand total of 271. PBS received 43 nominations. So, one can't help but wonder: What is cable doing that major networks aren't, in terms of drama? No more drama? ""Mad Men"" creator and executive producer Matt Weiner has his own theory. He told the Los Angeles Times: ""Cable has found a way to tap into a lot of frustrated creativity and exploit it financially. I can literally look at these shows on basic cable and pick where they would have been 10 years ago on network TV; some would not have been on at all."" Also, for the most part, cable series have shorter seasons than those on major networks. They usually run 10 to 13 episodes, as opposed to network television's 23 episodes a season. Shorter seasons tend to mean tighter storytelling and less ""filler"" episodes. (""Desperate Housewives,"" we are looking at you.) A perfect example of this is AMC's dramatic series ""The Killing,"" which based its entire short season on one murder. Every episode of ""The Killing"" had the viewer glued to the small screen, thanks to the show's tight storytelling, outstanding acting and production qualities. It is much easier to keep a narrative interesting over 13 shows (without having to include unnecessary storyline filler) as opposed to a typical network season of 22 shows. While a longer season is perfect for procedural dramas like ""CSI,"" ""Criminal Minds"" and ""Law & Order: SVU,"" shows that rely heavily on episodic storytelling have huge advantages with a shorter season. Another thing cable networks are doing extremely well is delivering shows with outstanding production values. Shows featured on HBO and AMC often have lavish, visually striking sets that could easily be the backdrop of a major motion picture. Last but not least, cable networks are blessed with the freedom to program to a niche audience. Network programming has been forced to cast a wider net, playing to the lowest common denominator. For instance, ABC's forthcoming remake of ""Charlie's Angels"" is a show that viewers would probably never see on an AMC network because of the pure fluff factor. Typically, cable networks tend to focus on producing intelligent shows that don't necessarily rely on gimmicks like the expected jiggle factor on a show like ""Charlie's Angels."" ""The Good Wife"" is good drama . However, one quality drama on network TV does stand out among the crowd. CBS's ""The Good Wife"" starring Julianna Margulies is arguably the best drama on network television right now. The combination of a stellar cast, high-quality writing and a compelling long-term story arc is superior to any other drama airing on the big four networks. The show's writers clearly value the intelligence of the show's viewers, and the actors are more than up to the task. Other networks need to look to ""The Good Wife"" and start taking more risks. One may argue that there is something for everyone on television these days. However, I'd like to see more shows in the vein of HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire"" gracing the television landscape, as opposed to more reboots like CBS's ""Hawaii Five-O"" and shows like the NBC dramedy ""Harry's Law.""","The Emmys will be Sunday night at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles .

"(CNN) -- The 2012 Summer Olympics are in the home stretch this week, but for the network airing them the games have just begun. As NBC celebrates ratings success with the Summer Games -- and weathers the shouts of #NBCfail from the critical -- it's also staring down the onset of fall TV season, that post-Labor Day flood of returning prime-time staples and new programming. In an attempt to rise above the swell and pick up as many viewers as possible, NBC's getting a jump-start on the competition and offering advance screenings of two new comedies following its Olympic coverage as well as two-week ""sampling"" windows on a variety of platforms for all its fall pilots ahead of their premieres. ""We are so committed to looking at this as a sampling opportunity that we're running it without commercials,"" said Vernon Sanders, NBC's executive vice president of current programming. ""We're not focused on ratings; we're focused on getting eyeballs."" The idea -- to secure viewership before a show premieres -- isn't a new strategy, and NBC's not the only network employing it. Fox, for example, has used pre-premiere sampling in the past to promote ""Glee"" and ""New Girl,"" and the network's doing the same again at the end of this month by offering a two-week window to watch pilots for ""The Mindy Project"" and ""Ben and Kate"" online ahead of their September premieres. But at the moment, Fox doesn't have the viewership that NBC has -- on Monday night, 26.6 million were tuned in to NBC during prime time -- nor does it have a reputation of poorly received fall seasons past to shake off. NBC's chairman of entertainment, Robert Greenblatt, reportedly told press at the recent Television Critics Association tour the brand's in a period of transition after being in last place since the '03-'04 season, and is trying to stretch toward content with broader appeal. To that end, no one's batting an eyelash that NBC is trying to capitalize on this sizable audience, but whether the efforts will pay off is up for debate. One potential kink is a question of timing, and whether TV-deluged audiences, more accustomed to on-demand versus appointment viewing, will remember to tune in a month. The answer to that, of course, will be compounded by the other question at hand, that of quality. It's no secret that in its post-""Friends"" and ""ER"" years, NBC acquired a rep for dismal programming, and was unable to find anything that stuck, said Susan Young, a TV critic and former president of the Television Critics Association. ""After a while, it's difficult to get momentum again,"" Young said. ""They've tried to do quality shows. 'Parenthood' is a quality show, 'Friday Night Lights' was a high-quality show, but they somehow just lost traction with viewers, and they have to do something to try to get people back into the tent."" Wednesday night will bring a look at Matthew Perry's ""Go On,"" a darker comedy about a radio sportscaster who joins a group therapy session after his wife dies. After the Games' closing ceremony Sunday, there'll be a viewing of ""Animal Practice"" in which Justin Kirk plays a womanizing veterinarian who's not that into people but does have a monkey sidekick. ""NBC has not done well in a crowded landscape,"" Young said, so this year's strategy ""gives an opportunity to let their shows shine. Having said that, they don't have very many shiny shows."" ""Animal Practice,"" in the estimation of free-lance TV critic Ryan McGee, ""is the lowest common denominator at the time when they have the most people."" Perry's ""Go On,"" while not a favorite, was more fully formed. ""For all of NBC's desires to sort of tack toward the middle, it's a very dark show,"" McGee said. ""I have no problem with drama in comedy. ... There's a lot of space in the half-hour medium to do different things. But people think 30 minutes and they think, if I didn't laugh the whole time this wasn't a successful episode of television. I don't know how ('Go On') will play after the shot put."" Regardless, ""They'd be foolish not to try,"" said Bill Gorman of TVBytheNumbers.com, although he hastened to add, ""I just don't think it's going to have that much of an effect."" The '08 Olympics, he noted, didn't offer a promotional boost for that year's fall lineup. ""All of NBC's new fall 2008 shows -- 'My Own Worst Enemy,' 'Knight Rider,' 'Kath & Kim,' 'America's Toughest Jobs,' 'Crusoe' -- were canceled in their rookie seasons,"" Gorman added via e-mail. ""None of them even received a full first-season order."" The concept for this year's strategy has been evolving since 2011, with NBC aware that the Olympics will bring viewers who are fans of the sporting event but who may not regularly watch the network. ""We're doing everything we can to get things out there. It's been a shift in thinking since Bob Greenblatt came aboard,"" NBC exec Sanders said. ""These days you have to do it all. ... When you're competing with four other networks and there's 15 new shows all premiering within one week, it becomes very difficult to get attention and, in some cases, convince people to check out your show, whether it's a new show or a show that they're loyal to. We're really hoping that by doing this not as a traditional launch, but just as a chance to get people to sample the shows, that we're getting to have a leg up on our competitors, perhaps, and to have a leg up on a more traditional launch."" The concept also applies to its prime-time fantasy show ""Grimm,"" which will launch its second season well ahead of the pack on August 13. Industry observers will likely watch how this plan pays off, as it's yet another sign of networks being confronted with a vastly changing landscape. ""There's really no need for a fall season anymore,"" said TV critic and NPR contributor David Bianculli of TVWorthWatching.com. ""That started so car companies could roll out their new car advertisements, and that's not happening. The British model of shows that have like, 10 episodes a season, seems to be much smarter in terms of getting good talent and good scripts, but it's not a model that has worked economically for the States yet."" Networks and newspapers, he added, are having ""the same problems right now. They're desperate for the viewers and readers that they don't have. They don't know how to get them, but in trying to attract them, they're alienating the people that they do have. I think they were trying for young, hip viewers with shows like ""Community,"" which certainly increased their Web presence and their presence in social media, but it didn't pay off in ways that counted, or at least still count for the networks."" Critic McGee agrees, noting that NBC's evolution could create problems as it raises awareness of the programming -- that being a lack of clarity of what makes an NBC show. ""Right now it's 'The Office,' 'Parks and Recreation' and 'Community,' "" but if you ask the broader contingent what's on NBC, ""they're going to say 'Law & Order: SVU' and 'The Biggest Loser,'"" which is problematic considering how well the other networks have shaped their content. ""CBS is a very well-defined identity, with basically the same show on every night, and people love that type of show. ABC is a well-defined identity, where it's family comedy with a slight edge plus reality programming for women,"" McGee said. ""Fox has its reality shows and slightly edgy comedies. NBC has been struggling for something -- it's got 'Parenthood' over here, it's got 'Community' over here, it's got 'The Biggest Loser' in the middle, it's got 'SVU' hanging on for dear life. It's trying to figure out -- when you think of NBC, what are you going to think of? Right now, they want you to think of Matthew Perry and a monkey."" For Sanders, the answer to the question about the network's brand is to create ""great shows"" -- and, yes, great ones that people watch. In his estimation, the network's aiming for greater accessibility, which isn't to discount its more sophisticated programming. The Thursday night comedies most readily associated with NBC -- ""Parks and Recreation,"" ""30 Rock,"" ""The Office,"" ""Community"" -- ""they've brought us attention and acclaim, and we're incredibly proud of them,"" Sanders said. ""As for these (new) shows, we're hoping that they're going to be just as smart, just as funny and insightful, and we're hoping that they're going to be instantly accessible to the audience,"" he continued. ""The big shift that I've felt in the development and the attention in these new shows is just making sure we're adding an extra dollop of heart.""","NBC will use the Olympics as an entree to two new comedies in coming week .

"(CNN) -- I'm writing about some changes we need to make in the wake of the horrible school shootings in Sandy Hook. Now stop. Take two deep breaths. Stop. Don't race to the bottom of the screen to leave a comment repeating the same statements you've made after every such shooting in your life. We have the same conversation each time. We say things that alienate our friends on Facebook. Or we get affirmative agreement from our family members. And nothing changes. Here's the good news: There are specific, meaningful policy guidelines we can adopt as a country that nearly everyone agrees with across the political spectrum. We'll never eliminate unexpected violence, but a small number of changes could save thousands of lives. Will Newtown change America's attitude toward guns? I've shared two key ideas with more than half a million people across a variety of social networks online in recent days, and even over this incredibly stressful weekend with such passionate feelings behind everyone's words, I've heard nearly universal consensus on implementing these two changes. 1. Mental health screenings before gun purchases. Because everyone in America will have health coverage next year, we can ask for a simple, straightforward clean bill of mental health before a person can buy a gun. Just like we ask drivers to take an eye test before hitting the road, we should do the same when someone wants to buy a gun. The most passionate target shooters, hunters and self-defense enthusiasts I know all agree: There are often warning signs in the boys and young men who usually carry out these acts of mass violence, and broadly implemented tests could reduce the number of them who have access to guns, without affecting any of the hundreds of millions of safe, responsible gun owners in America. While law enforcement officials say that the guns used in Newtown had been bought legally by Adam Lanza's mother, there are instances when rampage shooters have acquired guns illegally. And we are talking here about areas for broad agreement. A place to start. Which brings us to the second key idea. 2. More accountable gun distribution and retailing. Since the earliest days of our country, guns have been relatively readily available, and there's no need to compromise that to improve the safety of our gun distribution infrastructure. Instead, we can look at weak points in gun distribution through which guns go from legal manufacturers to illegal use. Gun shows that require only a brief in-person event with no live-fire training to qualify for a purchase permit, or that allow bulk purchase of weapons disrespect the care and dedication with which most gun owners teach themselves and their children. Again, a few simple changes requiring proof of real safety, such as shooting lessons before buying a weapon just makes common sense, not only to prevent irresponsible gun distribution, but to ensure that future generations of gun owners obey the traditions of the hundreds of years of millions of thoughtful, smart gun owners in America. Lawmakers seem prepared to take on gun control . Now stop. If you're like most Americans, you already have some canned response ready. You want to talk about a slippery slope or how guns don't kill people, people do. Or you want to rant about how barbaric and foolish gun owners are and how the Second Amendment was written in a totally different period in history. Two deep breaths. We've all heard all this before. When you fall back into those tired cliches, you put us back in the cycle where no progress happens. You put us back into a cycle where the responsible gun owners who don't mind some minor changes to encourage upholding the American tradition of safe shooting get stuck feeling defensive against the condescension of people who've never fired a gun. You put us back into a cycle where hundreds of millions of thoughtful opponents of the proliferation of lethal weapons in the hands of unstable people are forced to stand in disbelief as people tell them that these kinds of tragedies are somehow inherently American and thus can't be prevented. When I shared these two simple ideas with about half a million people across a few social networks, at first people responded out of habit, with extremists ranting about fantasies of armed insurrection against the government or of hundreds of millions of guns being melted down. Analysis: Guns and the law . But once they read what we're actually saying, hundreds of people, from across the political spectrum, came together and agreed on these principles, that a few simple ideas can make a big difference. I've seen gun-owning Obama voters in the hip hop industry who agree with prominent Romney supporters in the financial industry who would never bring a gun into their home, with all in favor of a few common-sense guidelines. We know we can fix things because we've made huge progress already. America is a far less violent country that it used to be. Violent crime overall is lower than it has been in decades. The reality is, the overwhelming majority of Americans kids are safe. But dozens of our kids are shot every week, so we have to do better. And just as we've made so much progress on so many intractable problems, we can fix this one, too. Step away from the usual rehearsed responses. Stop demonizing your fellow Americans, your fellow countrymen who love their kids as much as you do. Instead, start. Start with two simple ideas. And start by talking to someone who disagrees with you overall on all the big issues around guns and violence in our society, and see if you can't agree on these two points. We won't solve the whole problem, but at long, long last, we'll make a small bit of meaningful progress, and will have a policy that our representatives across the political spectrum can unite behind. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anil Dash.","Anil Dash: People revert to old arguments on gun control, but there are 2 areas of agreement .
He says in social network chats people agree: gun buyers should have mental health test .

"(EW.com) -- The Emmy nominations are being decided even as I write this. Members of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences must hand in their ballots by June 28; the nominations will be announced on July 19. Why don't we help out these folks and suggest worthy candidates? That's the thinking behind the long, carefully reasoned, highly passionate, sometimes stubbornly flukey list that follows. As EW's TV critic, I tend to have some opinions not shared by the majority of official Emmy voters. I also suspect, however, that you, the EW.com reader, share some of my passions -- such as ""Fringe,"" ""Girls,"" and ""Community"" -- that the Academy is unlikely to nominate. Which is one reason to agitate for them, right? Over the next couple of weeks, the entire EW.com staff, a hardy band I would dub The Emmy Watch Wizards, will be interviewing actors, producers, and writers from the shows on the list below. The Emmy Watch brigade will also post clips of their best work as part of this great project. I'm using the Emmy committee's eligibility period (June 1, 2011-May 31, 2012) and you're going to notice immediately that I exceeded the number of nominations possible in most categories. Why? Because it's a wish-list, and I wanted to expand these things here and there, to get in favorites, long shots, and, simply, the deserving. All of which is going to drive some of you nuts, I know, but that's part of the fun, I hope: Respond, argue, vote, and offer your own ballots for these categories. My wish-list begins below, deserving nominees in no order of preference -- it's the democratic free-for-all way! Comedy Series: Emmy Watch wish-list nominees: ""Community,"" ""Modern Family,"" ""Louie,"" ""Girls,"" ""Parks and Recreation,"" ""30 Rock,"" ""Enlightened,"" ""Happy Endings,"" ""How I Met Your Mother,"" ""The Middle"" With ""Girls,"" ""Enlightened,"" ""Louie,"" and ""Community,"" it's difficult to recall a season in which there were more major network (broadcast and cable) sitcoms that reshaped the genre the way these four have, each in a distinctively different manner. But I also think it was a very strong year for the mainstream sitcom â€” and just a few years ago, many readers would think I was stretching it to call brilliantly eccentric shows such as 30 Rock or Parks and Recreation mainstream. But headed up by Modern Family, whose mastery of both middle-American sitcom conventions and mass appeal outreach shows so signs of exhaustion, this is a list that suggests the sitcom is in robust health. Drama Series: Emmy Watch wish-list nominees: ""Breaking Bad,"" ""Homeland,"" ""Mad Men,"" ""Justified,"" ""Fringe,"" ""The Good Wife,"" ""Sons of Anarchy,"" ""Revenge,"" ""Game of Thrones,"" ""Parenthood"" For me, ""Homeland"" is the show to beat. No, ""Breaking Bad"" is. No, ""Justified"" is... you see the ""problem"" here: We're living in a new Golden Age of Drama! (A Platinum Age?) (A Twitter Age?) Add to this shows that don't have a prayer of getting nominated, led by ""Fringe"" and tailed by the artful trash of ""Revenge,"" and you've got an amazingly diverse range of possibilities. In another era, one not so dominated by cable, series such as ""Parenthood"" and ""The Good Wife"" would, I would assert, have won multiple Emmys already. Comedy Actor: Emmy Watch wish-list nominees: Joel McHale, Louis C.K., Jim Parsons, Alec Baldwin, Rob McElhenney . In contrast to other categories, this one yields the least number of nominees I am enthused about. (Which is worth a post of its own: How did sitcoms become so dominated by women as their central characters?) But I like the opportunity to give a nod to a very good actor in a mediocre series (that would be Jim Parsons/""Big Bang Theory""), as well as the chance to remind readers that Rob McElhenney has been doing excellently buffoonish work on ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia."" And of course I'm really pulling for Louis CK. Comedy Actress: Emmy Watch wish-list nominees: Amy Poehler, Laura Dern, Lena Dunham, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tina Fey, Zooey Deschanel, Patricia Heaton . What a formidable group of performers we have here. Poehler took ""Parks and Rec's"" political-campaign storyline and invested it with strong emotion as well as assiduous hilarity. You might call Lena Dunham's portrayal of Hannah in ""Girls"" minimalist or mumble-core-y; I'd call it marvelously sly. And Laura Dern: Holy cow, she turned ""Enlightened"" into a showcase for comic acting that carried the weight of the most riveting drama. Plus, Julia Louis-Dreyfus is giving a great performance in a show, ""Veep,"" that hasn't quite lived up to its initial promise. A fascinating category by any measure. Drama Actor: Emmy Watch wish-list nominees: Damian Lewis, John Noble, Jon Hamm, Bryan Cranston, Timothy Olyphant, Dustin Hoffman, Steve Buscemi . The formidable trio of Jon Hamm, Bryan Cranston, and Damian Lewis ought to be joined by John Noble, whose work on Fringe is fully the equal to the trio's, and I would definitely include Dustin Hoffman for his work on ""Luck,"" despite the fact that the abrupt cancellation of that daring series did not allow for what would doubtless have been the full flowering of what Hoffman had planted in his first season's labor. Drama Actress: Emmy Watch wish-list nominees: Claire Danes, Julianna Margulies, Elisabeth Moss, Katey Sagal, Elizabeth McGovern, Anna Torv . This category is comparable to what I was saying in the Comedy Actor segment: There aren't as many first-rate showcases for lead women as there are for men in dramas. That stipulated, I believe Anna Torv's various shadings of the multiple-universe Olivia Dunhams in ""Fringe"" was highly Emmy-worthy work. I also think that Elizabeth McGovern has been somewhat overlooked in all the praise for ""Downton Abbey"" -- her lovely approach to her character is a model of restrained yet highly effective acting. Whether or not this proved to be Elisabeth Moss' swan-song on ""Mad Men,"" her performance was remarkable, as she moved Peggy from dutiful, imaginative agency cog to a wise-verging-on-cynical woman who you can bet deserved that kiss of fealty Don Draper bestowed upon her hand. And all that said, Claire Danes is the one to beat, I'd wager. Supporting Actor Comedy: Emmy Watch wish-list nominees: Ty Burrell, Danny Pudi, Donald Glover, Ed O'Neill, Nick Offerman, Aziz Ansari, Chris Pratt, Max Greenfield . This is the category in which Emmy voters really need to widen their field of vision. If you don't grant that Danny Pudi and Donald Glover in ""Community,"" and Chris Pratt and Aziz Ansari in ""Parks and Recreation,"" are doing some of the most adroit acting on television, well, it's time for a revolution, comrades! And Ed O'Neill got some wonderful showcases for his fully fleshed-out creation in ""Modern Family"" this season. Supporting Actor Drama: Emmy Watch wish-list nominees: Giancarlo Esposito, Mandy Patinkin, John Slattery, Peter Dinklage, Aaron Paul, John Ortiz, Stephen Lang, Joel Kinnaman, Michael Pitt, Walton Goggins, Dax Shepard . Yes, this is one loaded-up list. But there's no one I could not suggest for nomination here. The suggestions of Slattery, Patinkin, Esposito, Dinklage, and Paul are all no-brainers. (In the case of Esposito's Gus Fring, it's literally a half-brainer.) But look at the rest of my picks. Joel Kinnaman frequently carried The Killing through its weaker episodes this season on his skinny frame. Dax Shepard made a leap in his acting when presented with some juicy subplots on ""Parenthood."" (Except for that romance with Cello Girl, that is.) And John Ortiz was -- I agree with a remark producer-writer David Milch made to me â€” ""the soul of 'Luck.'"" My left-field selection here, or so it might seem to you, is ""Terra Nova's"" Stephen Lang, but I would argue that his pumped-up, out-size performance was the best thing about that over-inflated, ultimately disappointing series. Supporting Actress Comedy: Emmy Watch wish-list nominees: Julie Bowen, Gillian Jacobs, Alison Brie, Eden Sher, Casey Wilson, Allison Williams, Kristen Wiig . As in the corresponding male category, new blood is needed here. Alison Brie and Gillian Jacobs in ""Community,"" Casey Wilson in ""Happy Endings,"" and Eden Sher in ""The Middle"" all deserve to be recognized for their varying approaches to wackiness. And as reader-divisive a figure as ""Saturday Night Live's"" Kristen Wiig can be (I know from my time recapping ""SNL"" that there's no quicker way to provoke a deluge of comments than to bring up, say, Gilly), she merits a spot here for her final-season, post-""Bridesmaids"" relentless work ethic-plus-talent. Finally, Allison Williams' work on ""Girls"" might actually be underrated by her casting as the sad-pretty-girl contrast to roommate Hannah, but she really pulled off a tricky role with deftness. Supporting Actress Drama: Emmy Watch wish-list nominees: Madeleine Stowe, Maggie Smith, Christina Hendricks, Archie Panjabi, Anna Gunn, Natalie Zea . Here is the most enjoyably motley group of nominees. While Hendricks and Smith are sure-things for official Emmy voters, I would add the firm swagger of Natalie Zea in ""Justified,"" the hip-swiveling heinousness that Madeleine Stowe projects in ""Revenge,"" and Anna Gunn's ""Breaking Bad"" performance, which only increases with controlled intensity every season.

"(CNN) -- Reality programs have long featured contestants of color in their casts. Competition shows like ""Amazing Race,"" ""The Biggest Loser"" and ""Dancing with the Stars"" have featured diverse contestants since their inaugural seasons in 2001, 2004 and 2005, respectively. But while African-Americans, Asians and Latinos can be seen racing around the world, losing weight and dancing the paso doble on TV, dating shows continue to be far less inclusive. Two African-American men filed a class action lawsuit in U.S. District Court on Wednesday, accusing ABC as well as other companies involved with the production of ""The Bachelor"" and ""The Bachelorette"" and creator Mike Fleiss of racial discrimination. The complaint alleges that, in 16 seasons of ""The Bachelor"" and seven seasons of ""The Bachelorette"" (the eighth season is slated to begin airing in May), the defendants have never featured ""a single person of color ... in the central role."" The suit also alleges that the few people of color who have been chosen to compete are often eliminated after the first few rose ceremonies. It should be noted that Cuban-born Mary Delgado won Season 6 of ""The Bachelor,"" and Puerto Rican Roberto Martinez won Season 6 of ""The Bachelorette."" But even ""The Bachelor's"" short-lived competition -- like ""Average Joe,"" ""For Love or Money"" and ""Joe Millionaire"" -- featured predominately white casts. So why does it seem like dating shows might be behind the curve when it comes to inclusion? Nashville-based plaintiffs Nathaniel Claybrooks and Christopher Johnson assert in their complaint that: ""'Dancing with the Stars' and 'Extreme Makeover' only involve platonic, as opposed to romantic, relationships among the cast members. This indicates that the presence of people of color in ABC programming is acceptable so long as there is no exhibition of actual romance between non-whites or whites and people of color."" The lawsuit has helped stoke a conversation about diversity and dating shows, especially when it comes to black-white relationships. Allison Samuels, a senior writer at Newsweek/The Daily Beast, said the men who filed suit may be on to something. ""When it comes to romance and love, I just don't think African-Americans ... are viewed as people who love or know how to love,"" Samuels said. ""We're made to be people who are not interesting or attractive ... and can't have that fairytale."" Young minority viewers might end up watching a show like ""The Bachelor"" and thinking, 'I'm not good enough to get on this show, but I'm good enough to get on the show where I can beat somebody up and fight all day long,' like ""Basketball Wives"" or ""Flavor of Love,"" she said. ""The Bachelor"" has set the tone for how women and people of color are portrayed on every dating show -- on network TV and cable, alike, said Jennifer L. Pozner, the author of Realitybitesbackbook.com. And for a decade, ""[ABC and creator Mike Fliess] have done everything they can to create an on-screen America that looks like the segregated South in the '50s,"" Pozner said, adding, ""It's as if [the network] is afraid they could lose advertisers by showing interracial dating."" Calling ""The Bachelor"" ""light and fluffy entertainment,"" Bradley Jacobs, a senior editor at US Weekly, said, producers are ""probably not interested in getting their hands dirty in some kind of interracial romance."" The show has always featured a bunch of ""white girls fighting over a white guy,"" Jacobs said. ""That's what the viewers, I guess, expect and what the advertisers, I guess, expect. ... A lot of people a still are against mixed-race marriages."" According to data from 2008 and published in Social Science Research last year, white women who were surveyed are more likely to approve of interracial relationships for others than themselves, while white men are more likely to personally engage in such relationships. People are increasingly becoming more accepting of interracial relationships, Samuels said. But TV doesn't ""push black-on-black love, so why would [viewers] want to see black-on-white love. It's taken a lawsuit to make people talk about this, but I'm not perplexed."" Arturo R. GarcÃ­a, the managing editor at Racialicious.com, said he is surprised ""The Bachelor's"" alleged whitewashing is just now being widely criticized. ""I'm surprised that someone like Fleiss didn't at least see the revenue potential of expanding the cast,"" GarcÃ­a said. ""Why wouldn't you feature a successful African-American man or woman?"" Not to mention the fact that ""a meaningful multicultural dating show ... would more closely reflect modern interaction,"" he added. However, GarcÃ­a said, one lawsuit can't immediately change the dynamic of such a long-running program. ""It would take a re-engineering of the show's thought process to make inclusiveness part of the culture of that program,"" he said. ""If the plaintiffs win and you see an African-American Bachelorette, would there be a stigma associated with her? She's only there because the lawsuit said she had to be there."" It's too soon to tell how the lawsuit might effect impending seasons of the dating show. But lawsuit or not, Lamar Hurd hopes to be wielding roses in the near future. The Portland-based sportscaster has been petitioning to become the first black Bachelor. This isn't the first time the issue of diversity has been raised regarding ""The Bachelor."" In March 2011, creator Fleiss told Entertainment Weekly: ""I think Ashley [Hebert] is 1/16th Cherokee Indian, but I cannot confirm. But that is my suspicion! We really tried, but sometimes we feel guilty of tokenism. Oh, we have to wedge African-American chicks in there! We always want to cast for ethnic diversity, it's just that for whatever reason, they don't come forward. I wish they would."" ""I'll take tokenism if it's going to get one person a job,"" Samuels said, referencing Fleiss' quote. ""The point now is that not even that one person is on there.""","A class action lawsuit accuses ""The Bachelor"" and ""The Bachelorette"" of racial discrimination .

"(CNN) -- Summertime has long been associated with pool parties and barbecues. But with so many new programs and series' finales on the way, the TV remote could be just as crucial this season as sunscreen and hot dogs. It used to be that reruns and reality TV shows were the stars of summer TV. And while reality staples such as ""Big Brother"" and ""Wipeout"" still stand, they're now offset by a slew of original dramas and comedies, some of which boast a star power that's relatively new to the summer season. This shift has been in the works for a while, since innovative cable shows began forcing networks to up the ante about six years ago, said Matt Whitfield, features editor at Yahoo! TV. ""This is the most highly anticipated summer in TV history,"" he said, adding that the lineup ""seems more exciting than the fall TV lineup."" HBO's new series ""The Newsroom"" will take viewers behind the scenes of a fictional cable news network when it premieres on June 24. It's one of the most buzzed-about new dramas, thanks in part to series creator Aaron Sorkin. The Oscar-winner is known for helming the Emmy-winning drama ""The West Wing,"" which aired for seven seasons on NBC. Starring Jeff Daniels, Emily Mortimer and Dev Patel, the series ""has award winner written all over it already,"" Whitfield said. HBO is owned by CNN's parent company. ""True Blood"" has been a summer staple since season 2 kicked off in June 2009 on HBO. Returning on Sunday, season 5 boasts a new draw -- ""Law and Order: SVU"" veteran Chris Meloni has joined the cast as a vampire. Three-time Oscar-nominated actress Sigourney Weaver will also grace the tube this summer on USA's ""Political Animals."" She'll play divorced, former first lady Elaine Barrish, who now serves as the secretary of state. Joining Weaver are Ellen Burstyn and Carla Gugino, among other notable stars. The series is set to premiere in July. The Weaver series is hardly USA's only lure this summer. ""Royal Pains,"" ""White Collar,"" ""Burn Notice"" and ""Suits"" will all be back. Highly anticipated final seasons beginning this summer include AMC's ""Breaking Bad"" and TNT's ""The Closer,"" which will air additional episodes to prepare for a potential spinoff. Meanwhile, come July 11, DirecTV will take ""Damages"" into its final season. Perhaps the summer season's greatest star power can be found on FX. Charlie Sheen's ""Anger Management"" will debut on June 28. Selma Blair and Shawnee Smith will also appear on the show, which features Sheen as an anger management therapist. ""There's no way that's not going to have huge ratings,"" said Whitfield, who added that ""Two and a Half Men's"" ratings haven't been so hot since Ashton Kutcher took over. ""People want Charlie,"" Whitfield continued. ""They're going to tune in for Charlie. ('Anger Management') could very well deliver FX's highest rating of all time."" FX also has a notable name behind its new series, ""Brand X With Russell Brand."" The comedian will star in the late-night series, sharing his take on everything from politics to pop culture. It's not as easy as it used to be for TV shows to breakout during the summer, said James Poniewozik, a senior writer and TV critic at Time magazine. ""(TV) is not as uncluttered over the summer anymore, but it's still easier than launching a show the way the big networks do in the fall -- where 80% of their new shows debut within the same couple of weeks in September."" And though summer is no longer a ""the world's wildest police chases and silly garbage,"" Whitfield said, programs such as ""Big Brother"" and ""So You Think You Can Dance,"" which he calls ""comfort food TV,"" aren't going anywhere. Joining the reality competition genre are dating shows such as Fox's ""The Choice"" and ""Take Me Out,"" which will premiere on Thursday. NBC's ""Love in the Wild"" kicked off its second season on Tuesday. And on the cable front of reality TV, MTV will launch ""Snooki and JWoww."" If only because people are curious to observe a pregnant Snooki, the new reality series is sure to attract viewers, Whitfield said. ""There truly is something for everybody this year.""","HBO's ""The Newsroom"" will take viewers behind the scenes of a fictional cable news network .

"(EW.com) -- Tuesday night's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show was chock full of buxom beauties, bedazzled bras and Beliebers. The sexiest night on television opened with a bang and kept its momentum alive throughout the show thanks to the musical stylings of Rihanna, Bruno Mars and Justin Bieber. Photos: 2012 Victoria's Secret fashion show . Here are the top 10 moments of the night: . 1. Circus Act . Ringmaster Adriana Lima opened the show in style. After the shock wore off that it was humanly possible to be that fit two months after giving birth, I became more aware of the show's aesthetics. A bizarre song mix and circus motif, marked by the Angels' mime and clown costumes and professional aerial contortionists, made the first runway walk truly memorable. As The Doors' ""Break on Through (To the Other Side)"" blended into Missy Elliott's ""Get Ur Freak On,"" I had a clear vision of what the rest of the night would hold: rock & roll and sex. 2. Diamonds and Lace . Even with a bevy of semi-naked ladies strutting beside her, Rihanna managed to steal the show with her first performance of the night. Wearing a black, strapless, corseted dress, the songstress was dressed more demurely than usual but sill looked smokin' hot thanks to her gown's high slit and garters. EW.com: Rihanna, Bieber and more perform at Victoria's Secret Fashion Show . 3. The Show Must Go On . In the most dramatic moment of the night, an Angel lost her ... hat. The behind-the-scenes cameras followed model Erin Heatherton backstage as a team of stylists struggled to pin her top hat to her head. Dressed as ""baby New Year"" to open the calendar girls segment of the show, a reluctant Heatherton was forced to take the plunge with an incomplete look. How could the audience possibly have known that she represented January without that pink hat? 4. Retro Fit . Bruno Mars may have been singing ""Locked Out of Heaven,"" but he was surrounded by Angels on stage. Accompanied by a live band, Mars fit the part of an old-school musician in the 1950s-themed calendar girls segment. He probably landed on Santa's naughty list by flirting with the scantily clad Mrs. Claus, but we love him just the way he is. 5. Bieber Fever . Before the barely-legal Biebs hit the stage, he salivated over the girls coming off the runway backstage while the VS Angels sang his praises to the camera. If that wasn't disturbing enough, the models also swooned in the background during his performances. EW.com: Victoria's Secret pink carpet pics . 6. Making a Belieber Out of You . The pop sensation's acoustic rendition of ""As Long As You Love Me"" was the only performance of the night not accompanied by a runway show. I was surprised by the age appropriateness of the act until the Pink Ball commenced and the teen broke into ""Beauty and a Beat."" Nicki Minaj wasn't there to show off her assets so Bieber resorted to exchanging smoldering glances with the models instead. 7. Pop Culture Pizzazz . Aside from Bieber's futuristic ""3012â€³ space look, a few other odd outfits caught my eye during the Pink Ball. There was Dorothy from ""The Wizard of Oz,"" who was business in the front, party in the back; a sexy Buzz Lightyear from ""Toy Story""; and an angel in a bicycle handlebar-ed vest, prompting the question, ""can you ride your bike with no handlebars?"" 8. Silver Screen Sirens . Mars returned to the stage for a performance of ""Young Wild Girls"" in my favorite segment of the night. The wings -- along with feather plumes, headdresses and sequins -- finally came out as the girls strutted their stuff in the show's most extravagant costumes. Whether evoking old Hollywood glamour or Renaissance decadence, the girls dazzled in diamonds and slow-motion sequences. Yes, the Angels are young and wild, but Rihanna's ""Diamonds"" would have been a more appropriate song choice. EW.com: 11 years of fantasy bras from 'Victoria's Secret Fashion Show' 9. Model Behavior . The show featured a short segment spotlighting South African model and Italian Vogue cover girl Candice Swanepoel. Aside from allowing her to be both seen and heard (it's safe to say that she didn't attend the Milford School), the video was further proof that Victoria's Secret should change its name to Model United Nations. 10. Angels in Bloom . After changing into a sheer, lingerie-style getup, Rihanna closed the show with her new single ""Fresh Off the Runway."" She faded more into the background this time around due to the trapeze acts and life-size flowers barging down the runway. Of course, Alessandra Ambrosio looked flawless in her $2.5 million floral fantasy bra (now that's a push-up!). I initially thought the bra was too over-the-top, even by VS standards, but it fit the floral theme and looked relatively ordinary compared to her stunning, over-sized orchid wings. Although a lesser known flower (and model), Lily Aldridge won the prize for the most adorable costume of the segment with a tiger lily skit with lily pad wings. Claude Monet must have been stirring in his grave. See the full story at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

"Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, John Vause describes the effect tainted food has had on a foreigner. CNN's John Vause says he's lost 10 pounds in recent weeks as reports of tainted food have come out in China. BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Eating out in China used to be one of the great experiences of living here. I often thought going out with friends and colleagues for dinner was a bit like the game of ""Hungry Hungry Hippos"" -- vast quantities of amazing food that made dining a pleasure. Best of all, it was affordable and palatable. But these days, the joy of anticipation of what the next dish will bring has been replaced with, well, the dread of what the next dish may contain. When ordering at restaurants, I wonder: Is that drug-tainted fish and shrimp? Did that pork come from a pig that was force-fed wastewater? Any melamine added to those noodles? Those are among some of the recent food scares here. Even drinking a glass of water instills fear: A recent government report found half the bottled watered in this city was counterfeit. I was never a particularly brave soul when it came to eating at exotic little restaurants here, but now I am terrified. When traveling across China, that fear goes off the charts. Packing for trips now includes muesli bars made in the United States and imported almonds.  Watch food elitism in Hong Kong » . And then there is the grocery shopping. Everyone else around the world it seems is buying cheap food and other products made in China. Not the Vause house. My wife searches across this city for breakfast cereal made in the United States. We have meat and fish flown in from Australia, milk from New Zealand, and on it goes. Some things are unavoidable, but we do our best. Maybe it's irrational on my part. Certainly many friends who have lived here longer than I have insist there's nothing to fear. They argue in a country this size there will always be isolated cases like the ones that have surfaced lately. But I have another perspective. In a Communist country where corruption is rampant and the press appears only free to go after the little guy, I believe the deep systemic problems go unreported -- that is until dogs and cats in the United States start dying from pet food made with Chinese-tainted ingredients and the world starts asking China some very difficult questions. The Communist leadership has acknowledged the corruption problem in China and they know they can make all the pronouncements about food quality they want from Beijing. But that means almost zilch as long as the local businessmen are paying off local officials who are paying off the local police who are meant to enforce whatever new standards and regulations are announced. And that's the rub. There's a fortune to be made cutting corners and ignoring the rules, and almost no risk if you get caught. Watch the cures that kill . There are notable exceptions. For instance, the former head of China's Food and Drug Administration was executed for taking bribes and approving deadly medicine. The People's Daily, the mouthpiece for the Communist Party, wrote the day after Zhen Xiaoyu's death sentence was carried out that it was a warning to all officials. ""Corrupt elements will be thoroughly investigated no matter who they are, how high their post, or how deep they hide, and there can be no appeasement or softness,"" it said. I have my doubts. I also met with the general manager of one of the companies at the center of the melamine-tainted rice gluten exports earlier this year. He was in prison and looked dazed and confused. I got the distinct impression that he had no idea why he was in jail for something widely believed being done by so many others. It's just that his melamine loaded rice gluten killed dogs and cats in the United States. The bottom line is: If you're worried about Chinese exports, rest assured the local stuff is without doubt many, many times worse. It's scary to live here not knowing if the food and drinks are safe. But on the upside, in the last month, since the food scare story really took off, I've dropped 10 pounds. I guess there is an upside to everything.

"(CNN) -- Nearly five months after signing off from MSNBC, left-wing news personality Keith Olbermann returned to the airwaves Monday with the relaunch of his signature ""Countdown"" show on Current TV. While known for generally opposing Republicans and supporting Democrats, Olbermann signaled that both parties would be targets in his ""Special Comment,"" a segment that was also part of his previous show. ""The nation is losing its independence through the malfeasance of one party and the timidity of the other,"" he said, according to the show's blog. Still, the early take from the inaugural show suggested it would lean left, as evidenced by one segment labeled ""Inside the Republican Cult."" Guests included liberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, Daily Kos blogger Markos Moulitsas and John Dean, a former White House counsel to President Richard Nixon and now a conservative critic. Olbermann said he will be a frequent contributor to the show. Olbermann abruptly left MSNBC in late January after eight years at the news network. In his time there, the former sports news anchor became a favorite of progressives for challenging rivals at Fox News and elsewhere, though he also faced criticism and publicly aired his frustrations with NBC's management. He signed a deal weeks later with Current Media, a company founded in 2005 by former Vice President Al Gore and Joel Hyatt. Besides hosting and producing his new prime time nightly news and commentary show, Olbermann is also Current Media's chief news officer and has an equity stake in the company. The 52-year-old had been suspended from MSNBC for two days in November 2010 after the news website Politico revealed he had made donations to three Democrats . That includes $2,400 -- the maximum amount that can be given by an individual -- given to the campaign of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who was seriously wounded in a mass shooting in Tucson. He also donated to the campaigns of Senate candidate Jack Conway of Kentucky and U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona. Conway lost his bid, while Grijalva and Giffords won. Olbermann's alliance with Current TV is another major transition for a man who, before his time with MSNBC, spent 13 years with the sports network ESPN. Current TV can be seen in more than 75 million households worldwide.","Olbermann's first show since leaving MSNBC airs on Monday night .

"(CNN) -- From a woman who sold fax machines door-to-door to being named a billionaire, Sara Blakely's career trajectory has been anything but usual. No Ivy-League MBA in sight, Blakely has helmed Spanx, a company that produces slimming bodywear -- bras, panties and more -- to a presence in more than 50 countries and an estimated value of over $1 billion, according to Forbes. With product names such as ""Bra-lellulah"" and headquarters complete with boudoir-like red walls, Blakely's empire is the opposite of corporate. Even the inspiration behind her privately-held company is like no other -- her own rear. ""I just did not like the way it looked in white pants,"" says Blakely. ""That moment inspired Spanx. I had been doing some soul searching and visualization of my life to create a product that I could sell to millions of people."" Spanx revenues for 2011 were estimated at just under $250 million, according to independent research by Forbes Magazine. The magazine also cited that four Wall Street investment banks valued the company at $1 billion. This year, Spanx expanded into standalone retail stores in the U.S., opening two in November and a third in this month. What started out as a pair of pantyhose with its feet cut out in 1998, has evolved into a diverse business that includes active wear, menswear and swimwear. In person, Blakely, 41, is attractive, chatty and breaks out into a wide grin frequently. Shunning businesswoman power suits, she's often spotted in a pair of jeans and cotton T-shirt, wearing her hair in hair bands. Professionally too, Spanx defies the odds. Where over 50% of American small businesses fail in the first five years, according to figures from the U.S. Small Business Administration, Spanx, now 12, has weathered the economic crisis and Blakely is planning further international expansion. They will begin selling in Italy in early 2013, with plans to target Brazil, France, Eastern Europe, China, India and Russia. Read related: How Scandinavia's 'CEO of ideas' puts creativity into action . Blakely credits her success to getting comfortable with failure and rejection early. After failing the LSAT law exam, her lifelong dream to be a lawyer was dashed. After a short stint as a ride greeter at Disney World she spent seven years selling fax machines. She describes her days as a door-to-door salesman as ""very difficult, very humbling with lots of tears."" Blakely now says she's grateful for the great training she got from ""having doors slam in my face."" Blakely launched Spanx with just $5,000 and an unwavering belief the product was exactly what the world needed (she patented it almost immediately). Then, as she faced rejection upon rejection meeting with mill-owners in North Carolina, trying to find someone who would make her girdle, she says her perseverance combined with -- wait for it -- her lack-of-experience, eventually won out. ""I used a lot of very confident, very powerful language, but I also asked for help. If you cover up your weaknesses, I think you miss opportunities for human nature to want to kick in. At the end of the day, the guy ended up just wanting to help me. He didn't even believe in the idea."" Calling on the sales skills she learned in her cold-calling days, Blakely stood in department stores every day for two years talking to customers to sell her panties. ""I learned very quickly that my biggest challenge was location of the store -- (Spanx were) put in the sleepiest corner. I realized, 'This is going to come here and leave if I don't personally intervene, even if I have to sell every pair myself.' And that's basically what I did."" Blakely often snuck Spanx products relegated to the back of department stores closer to checkout, and spent nights stuffing shipping orders into padded envelopes. All while continuing her day job. Read related: Should women reject Spanx? In 2000, just two years after launching the first rear-shaping prototype, Oprah Winfrey named Spanx her favorite product of the year. Blakely says was getting her hair highlighted when Oprah's studio called. She remembers jumping out of the chair and running out of the salon with all the foils still in her hair ""having a full-blown happy attack -- dancing, cheering and clapping."" The unexpected publicity catapulted her to international acclaim. By 2012, she was listed as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people. Fast forward to today and Blakely who is now mother to 3-year-old son, Lazer, says she balances her hectic work schedule with family life by ""prioritizing, delegating and letting go."" Her motto is: ""What if the Hokey Pokey really is what it's all about?"" It's painted on a wall in all her homes and she says it reminds her to take life less seriously. It also helps her overcome extreme fears like flying --- one she faces regularly as she shuttles between her base in Atlanta and New York where her husband lives. She says: ""The biggest risk in life is not risking. Every risk you take in life is in direct proportion to the reward. If I'm afraid of something, it's the next thing I have to go do. That's just the way I've been."" Read related: Top designer shares secret of staying in vogue . Now, her main professional focus is ""world butt domination through Spanx or Assets"" (a cheaper line). Already, over six million women wear the Spanx Power Panty, according to the company. She's also continuing to create new products --""the competition is watching us so closely"" -- while dedicating resources to empowering women. The Sara Blakely Foundation has donated over $20 million to charity. Blakely owns 100% of the business and says she has no plans to take the company public in the near future. Instead, she'd rather spend resources developing a product to fill another gap in the market. ""Before I retire, I want to make a comfortable high heel. I don't subscribe to the beauty is pain philosophy.""

"(CNN) -- In English soccer it is an offense that is taken as seriously as almost any other -- diving. And once again, it is controversial Liverpool striker Luis Suarez in the firing line. After their Premier League clash on Saturday, Stoke manager Tony Pulis called for the Uruguayan to be banned by the Football Association, for what he saw as Suarez's ""embarrassing"" attempt to win a penalty. It is not the first time Suarez has been accused of play acting but his manager Brendan Rodgers has launched an impassioned defense of his star player, claiming that coverage of his fall has overshadowed a stamping incident earlier in the match. Stoke's German defender Robert Huth appeared to tread on Suarez during a tangle at Anfield, leaving the striker with a stud mark on his chest, but the FA has decided not to take any action against the German. And through the club's official website, Rodgers has expressed his frustration that all the focus is on Suarez, and not Huth. ""I find it incredible that in nearly all the coverage about Luis Suarez this weekend, very little focus has been placed on the fact that he was actually the victim of a stamping incident within the first five minutes of the game,"" said Rodgers. ""At this moment there seems to be one set of rules for Luis and another set for everyone else."" Pulis' Stoke team has a reputation as being one of the most physical sides in the English Premier League and only two weeks ago he labeled two Chelsea players ""laughable"" for what he saw as contrived attempts to win a penalty. The Welshman implored the authorities to clamp down on players who dive and told reporters a three-match ban would stop them from ""falling over."" ""Suarez is a fantastic player with great ability,"" he added. ""He is a handful and he is the one player we are frightened to death about. ""What happens is that he puts enormous pressure on the referee. Every time he goes down, you have got 40,000-odd Liverpool supporters getting after the referee and I don't think that's right. It is a tough enough job as it is."" Suarez has become one of the league's most talked about players since joining Liverpool from Dutch club Ajax in January 2011. He is also one of its most divisive. The 25-year-old was banned for eight Premier League matches after being found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra last year. His technical ability means he is always closely guarded by opposition teams, and Liverpool have complained in the past he doesn't get enough preotection from the officials. Rodgers thinks Saturday's incident with Huth is a perfect illustration of that. In the Liverpool manager's opinion, Suarez is being persecuted. He added: ""Diving and simulation is obviously a wider issue in football and one that we all agree has to be eradicated from our game but there were other incidents this weekend that didn't seem to generate the same coverage. ""No one should be distracted by the real issue here, both at Anfield and at another game played on Sunday, when Luis and another player were hurt in off-the-ball incidents that went unpunished but were caught on TV cameras. ""I believe some people need to develop a sense of perspective and I also believe in this moment the vilification of Luis is both wrong and unfair.""","Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers defends Luis Suarez as striker is accused of diving .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Ashton Kutcher teased Twitter followers Thursday night about reports that he'll join the ""Two and a Half Men"" cast to fill the gap left by Charlie Sheen's departure. The actor tweeted this riddle to his 6,659,567 followers: ""what's the square root of 6.25?"" The answer is 2.5, as in ""two and a half."" Kutcher's posting may the best clue amid silence from CBS, the network that airs the hit sitcom, and Warner Bros., the studio where the show is produced. They've both responded with ""no comment"" to CNN calls about a Kutcher contract. Entertainment industry publications, including The Hollywood Reporter, are calling it a done deal, citing unidentified sources close to the negotiations. Hugh Grant almost replaced Sheen on 'Men' Kutcher, who gained his early fame on a TV sitcom -- ""That '70s Show"" -- has more recently been seen on the big screen. His last film was ""No Strings Attached,"" which hit theaters in January. He's also made his mark as a TV executive producer, most notably for MTV's hidden camera show ""Punk'd."" While Kutcher gives fans a math quiz, the equation he's watching could involve his paycheck. Sheen, who is embroiled in a lawsuit over his sudden dismissal from the show, was earning a reported $2 million for each episode. Producers have been scrambling in recent weeks to find a replacement for Sheen to keep one of TV's highest-rated sitcoms on the air for another year.","Kutcher tweets a riddle with ""two and a half"" as the answer .

"(TIME.com) -- It's one thing to find a strategy that works in the lab, but quite another to prove that it's effective in the real world as well. A decade ago, researchers at the National Institutes of Health made headlines when they published the results of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The study, which was designed to compare the effects of diet and exercise against the best medications to control the chronic disease, surprisingly showed that diet and exercise were better than the best drugs scientists had developed to protect those at highest risk from developing diabetes. The results were encouraging and disheartening at the time, however, since lifestyle changes are notoriously the most difficult to implement. It's too challenging for patients to stick with a diet and exercise program, and even if they did, their motivation typically wanes after six months. TIME.com: Type 2 diabetes is tougher to treat in kids and teens . But the findings -- the diet and exercise group lowered their risk of getting diabetes by 58% compared to those on medications -- were too stunning to ignore. The DPP relied on intensive and highly individualized coaching to help the patients stay on their diet and fitness regimens. How could the strategies used in the DPP be modified to work in the real world, where personal nutritionists and trainers aren't always at our beck and call? Dr. Jun Ma, an associate investigator at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Research Institute and a consulting professor at Stanford University, was eager to find out. As a primary care physician, she says, ""we know there are huge numbers of patients out there who need this type of intervention. We just don't have the manpower and resources to deliver interventions such as the one tested in the DPP. That motivated me and my collaborators to find practical ways of delivering the principles of DPP in a more realistic manner."" TIME Video: Competing in the Olympics with Type 1 diabetes . Ma joined forces with scientists at the University of Pittsburgh who had participated in the government's DPP study and were already tackling that very question. They had developed the Group Lifestyle Balance, a curriculum culled from the DPP that they were testing in both group-based and home-based settings. The 12-week program involved either weekly face-to-face sessions with a registered dietitian and fitness instructor in a class setting in which participants learned and discussed healthy diet and exercise techniques, or a self-motivated program based on DVDs that taught participants similar healthy living techniques. Ma used the same Group Lifestyle Balance curriculum and DVD in her study involving 241 people with pre-diabetes, but modified what the self-motivated group received by adding online and e-mail counseling as well. After three months of intensive training and a year of maintenance sessions, the coach-led group lost an average of 14 pounds, while the DVD group shed 10 pounds; the control group, which received usual care but no specific weight-loss goals, lost only five pounds. More than double the proportion of people using the coach-led sessions (37%) reached the DPP goal of losing 7% of their starting body weight, while 36% of those using DVDs and only 14% of those getting usual care reached that goal. TIME.com: Heart risk for diabetics may be exaggerated . The findings confirm that new strategies for helping at-risk people to control and even reverse impending symptoms may be just as effective, if not more so in some cases, than currently available treatments. ""I would want to encourage national initiatives to consider alternative ways for lowering diabetes risk, such as the ones we tested,"" says Ma. ""Based on the evidence, face-to-face interventions seem to have the strongest effect, but there is data accumulating to support alternative delivery strategies such as through DVDs or online. And considering the number of people at risk of diabetes and heart disease, we need to find meaningful and sustainable ways to reach these people."" Ma says she and her colleagues intentionally tested strategies such as using e-mail reminders, online counseling and self-initiated DVD sessions because they rely on already-existing resources and would not require extensive investment in infrastructure. While the study only followed the participants for 15 months, Ma says continued research on such alternative strategies may lead to methods that are even longer-lasting and inspire even stronger compliance in the future. ""Longer-term follow-up and longer-term success is something that is attracting a lot of research interest right now,"" she says. And as the results suggest, for good reason.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The woes of Boeing's new 787 mount as U.S. regulators ordered airlines to stop flying their Boeing 787s. The U.S. move comes after two fleets of Boeing 787s have been grounded in Japan after alarms and a burning smell in the cabin forced a Dreamliner to make an emergency landing Wednesday. The incident is the most serious in a spate of problems that have bedeviled the new aircraft, and comes after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which is responsible for air safety, launched a comprehensive examination on Friday of the Dreamliner's design as well as its manufacture and assembly. ""The Boeing 787 incidents have taken on a new seriousness with the grounding"" by All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Japan Airlines (JAL), said Richard Quest, CNN's aviation correspondent. ""The potential of fire on board an aircraft is among the most serious issues in aviation,"" he said. ""The plane is still safe to fly. However, Boeing must ensure the reliability of the aircraft for the airlines and the confidence of the traveling public to fly on the planes. ""That is the fundamental problem that Boeing is now facing,"" Quest said. U.S. grounds Dreamliners over fire risk . What happened? As CNNMoney reports, a Boeing 787 operated by All Nippon Airways was forced to make an emergency landing Wednesday in Japan. The domestic aircraft was traveling to Tokyo when irregular battery activity and smoke in the forward electrical compartment were detected. The aircraft then made an emergency landing at Takamatsu airport after a burning smell was detected in the plane's cabin. Following the incident, both All Nippon and Japan Airlines said they were immediately grounding their Dreamliner fleets -- which effectively grounds about half of the Dreamliners now in operation worldwide. The Japanese airlines were among the first to take delivery of the Boeing 787. ANA has 17 aircraft, while JAL has seven Dreamliners. Worldwide, Boeing has delivered 50 Dreamliners -- but hundreds more are on order. More than 150 Dreamliner flights occur daily, according to Boeing. Japanese airlines suspend Dreamliner flights after emergency landing . What problems has the Dreamliner had? In recent weeks, many. The most recent Dreamliner setbacks occurred Friday. Oil was discovered leaking from a generator on an engine at a Japanese airport, and a crack appeared in a cockpit window of a plane en route from Tokyo to western Japan, a spokeswoman for All Nippon Airways said. On January 8, a Japan Airlines flight bound for Tokyo aborted takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport after a pilot on another airplane spotted the 787 leaking fuel. On January 7, a maintenance worker discovered the electrical fire aboard an empty plane being prepared at a gate at Logan for a return trip to Japan. Another Japanese flight was cancelled last week after sensors detected problems with the plane's braking system. In December, a United Airlines 787 traveling from Houston to Newark, New Jersey, was diverted to New Orleans because of mechanical problems. A general inspection of all 787s in September turned up cracked engines on two planes. The woes come after the debut of the plane in 2011 -- nearly three years behind its production schedule. Related: More trouble for Boeing as Dreamliner forced to make emergency landing . Do Dreamliners fly in the U.S.? United Airlines -- which has six 787s -- debuted the nation's first domestic Dreamliner routes last November. ""We continue to have complete confidence in the 787 and the ability of Boeing,"" United said Friday in a statement. The airline described the problems as ""early operational issues."" United's Dreamliner fleet travels primarily on routes connecting Houston and Chicago and between Newark and Los Angeles. Last week, the airline kicked off its first international 787 service between Los Angeles and Tokyo. Other U.S. carriers are in line to buy Dreamliners, including Delta. American Airlines has announced an order, but it's not yet ""firm."" What does the troubles mean for Boeing? The company's stock has taken a hit as the troubles mount. Several hundred are under order, making its success crucial for Boeing, which had not designed a new commercial jetliner in years before unveiling the Dreamliner. ""The 787, being a new airplane, does have teething problems,"" John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told CNN last week. It's common for new planes to have ""these kinds of problems,"" he added. Airlines have been excited by the Boeing 787 as the first mid-size, long-range airplane, which would allow airlines to open up routes where they don't have enough demand from passengers to justify a larger plane like a Boeing 747 or an Airbus A380. Related: How the 787 will change the way we fly . Boeing has more than 800 unfilled orders from airlines around the globe that will take years to fill. In addition to the Dreamliner assembly line at its Seattle-area factory, it built a new 1,000-worker factory in South Carolina to handle the demand. It hopes to double production of the plane this year to about 10 a month.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Reports that ""virginity tests"" were conducted on would-be-brides for a mass wedding has prompted India's federal woman rights watchdog to launch an investigation. Young Indian men and women are paraded before a mass wedding in 2006 in the village of Funda. But a district magistrate said the tests were simply ""clinical examinations"" that were initiated after one of the brides gave birth at a previous mass wedding. In largely-conservative India, pre-marital sex remains a taboo. In fact, sexually explicit scenes on screen in Bollywood and on television sometimes spark controversies. The alleged tests happened in Madhya Pradesh state which is controlled by conservative Hindu nationalists who are members of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. The controversy is indicative of the row between them and their opponents in the Congress Party, who dominate the federal government. The National Commission for Women (NCW) said it has also sought a report from the government and police of Madhya Pradesh state, its spokeswoman Kareena B. Thengamam told CNN. She said the NCW had become aware of reports that some 150 brides-to-be, mostly tribal women, were subject to ""virginity tests"" before their mass wedding on June 30 as part of a state government scheme. The watchdog has also formed an inquiry committee of its own. State authorities, however, denied conducting any virginity tests, but insisted they were ""just clinical examinations"" before the event. On its part, Madhya Pradesh state insists the ""clinical examinations"" aimed to keep the event free from any fraudulent entries -- like women already married, but wanting to get free wedding goodies. The state government organizes mass weddings involving economically-backward couples, with support worth $130 for each pair. The support is not in cash, but in the form of household articles. The district magistrate of Shahdol, where the mass wedding took place, said 13 women were found to be pregnant in the examinations, which he claimed followed ""routine"" questioning about their age and health. ""Another was found to be minor (underage),"" Neeraj Dubey added. None of the 14 was allowed to take part in the mass wedding. District officials introduced clinical examinations on women wanting to get married in the mass weddings after a participant delivered a baby right at the event earlier, he said. ""But there is no internal examination; it's only abdomen check and that too after some questioning,"" he claimed.","Indian rights watchdog investigates reports of ""virginity tests"" on would-be-brides .

"(CNN) -- Unlike popular period drama ""Downton Abbey,"" any chatting in ""Ripper Street"" takes place after a good brawl, in a brothel or over a dead body in the morgue -- not a cup of tea. Teeth-jarring fights and the gruesome discovery of a ""ripped tart"" in the shadow-filled streets of London's East End are the first glimpses viewers have of BBC America's new crime drama, all set to the eerie soundtrack of a grating violin. So if your favorite part of ""Downton"" is anticipating the war between former co-conspirators Thomas Barrow and Sarah O'Brien or Mr. Bates' violent side, this visceral series might be more your style. Set in 1889, ""Ripper Street"" explores the gritty aftermath of the Jack the Ripper murders in Whitechapel. The H Division police force works tirelessly to keep chaos, and even more crime, from overtaking the streets. Viewers will see the seedy side of London through three main H Division policemen, played by Matthew Macfadyen (""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""Anna Karenina""), Jerome Flynn (""Game of Thrones"") and Adam Rothenberg (""Alcatraz""). The eight-part series premieres at 9 p.m. ET Saturday on BBC America. ""Copper"": Bringing 1864 New York to life, grit and all . Series creator and writer Richard Warlow (""Mistresses"") wanted to tap into how the Jack the Ripper murders still resonate today. His goal, he said, was to show the ways the horrific crimes affected life in London, not to answer the mystery of Jack's identity. ""I was more fascinated by the London folklore, and the idea of a very old city like ours having this extra life that these stories give it,"" Warlow said. ""Real things happen and then they become embedded in the mythic strata of our city. Rather than offer any solutions, what we're trying to show is the place where that myth first embedded itself."" He had to draw on a balance of research and his own imagination, creating a universe that feels new even for fans of Johnny Depp's ""From Hell"" or BBC's modern-day series take, ""Whitechapel."" In another twist, Warlow didn't want to lead the series with well-known Scotland Yard Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline, often the main character in other Ripper stories. Instead, he chose the real-life boss of H Division, Inspector Edmund Reid, played by Macfadyen. ""We wanted Reid to be a different kind of copper, somebody who was affected by the work he did, but that it didn't make him maudlin. Matthew gives you great presence, but at the same time, he gives you such soul, I think. He brings a solid sense of integrity about everything that he does."" Abberline is an integral part of the Ripper story, so he's included as a supporting character, portrayed ""beautifully"" by Clive Russell as a man that has been broken by something, Warlow said. In the first episode, Reid talks about trying to move forward, and while they tried to do everything to find the Ripper, all that matters is that the murderer is gone. The Ripper is not going to own Reid's life anymore. It is one of Warlow's favorite scenes. ""That felt powerful, not just for Reid, but it was a broader message for the whole show -- we're not going to get ourselves hung up on who Jack the Ripper is, but really concentrate on the streets that he influenced so much."" Immediately after the Ripper murders, sensationalism, fear and a desire for normalcy all swirled together in Whitechapel. The H Division Police Force's efforts to contain the hysteria is evident in the characters of Reid, his right hand man, Sgt. Bennet Drake (Flynn) and Capt. Homer Jackson (Rothenberg). Jackson is an American in the distinctly British show, playing an ex-Pinkerton detective that's hiding in Whitechapel and living in a brothel, maintaining a contemptuous relationship at best with the madam, Long Susan. He has a taste for vice and a handy skill with early forensics as a former Army surgeon. Jackson's character, like the others, is fraught with duality. Combined with Reid and Bennet, their conflict, friction and chemistry creates a compelling dynamic. ""He fits into the story by not fitting in,"" Rothenberg said. ""In some ways, he can be a surrogate for the American audience looking at that time and place. At the same time, he represents their perception of America at the time -- he's the wild West."" Although he ambles around Whitechapel in his brown hat and green jacket with a six-shooter strapped to his waist, it was the mustache (he would never grow one for himself), and Warlow's larger-than-life concept of Jackson, that made things come alive for Rothenberg. ""Richard has a way of writing that puts you right there,"" he said. ""I think it's a new voice that people haven't heard written for that time. Set design, costuming -- everything was conspiring to make you believe that's where you were."" The crew filmed the entirety of the show in Dublin, rather than London, and Warlow gives credit to production designer Mark Geraghty and costume designer Lorna Mugan for helping create the authentic edgy atmosphere of Whitechapel. Today, there is little inspiration to be found in the office buildings that now cover the East End's historic streets, with the exception of a stray alleyway or two, but the finished product resembles what Warlow and his team imagined. The Victorian costuming is elegant, while the streets are cramped and dirty with notorious interludes and crime to be found in every alley. ""It was an insane time, in an insane area -- an intense pressure cooker,"" Rothenberg said of the era. While London has evolved immensely from that infamous time, the cloak of its history is still tangible for visitors and residents alike, Warlow said. That's what he hopes to capture in ""Ripper Street."" ""They can get a sense of this city of ours, of London, and of all the kind of the darkness that lies behind its streets and gives the city its flavor -- the history of terrible things but rather wonderful people who have lived here throughout those times.""","""Ripper Street"" is a gritty new period drama from the BBC .

"(CNN) -- President Obama threw down the gauntlet to congressional Republicans at his press conference on Monday. He will not, he asserted forcefully, allow the United States' credit rating be held hostage by hard-liners demanding budget cuts ""or else..."" In short, the president's message was that he would not negotiate with fiscal terrorists. He may have sounded adamant and unbending to some. But his position was hardly out of place. Speaker John Boehner and the Republicans in the House of Representatives are holding a gun to the head of the American economy and threatening to pull the trigger if the president doesn't bend to their will. On some level, they must realize that allowing the United States to default on financial obligations that Congress itself racked up would not only sow chaos in the financial markets and reignite the recession, but also sign the death warrant for the modern Republican Party. If the GOP -- already a party at odds with science, history, math, women, senior citizens, the poor and minority populations -- were to willfully and recklessly play politics with the full faith and credit of the United States, it would virtually ensure that by 2014, Democrats would retake the majority in the House of Representatives and expand their edge in the Senate. This could create a nightmare for many on the right: an Obama presidency in which Democrats could press through their full agenda with little resistance. Even the most rabid Republican partisans must recognize that they are playing with fire. News: Obama: We aren't a deadbeat nation . They are overreaching in part to help redeem what was widely seen as a defeat for them in the tax deal that was struck at the beginning of the year -- the slight tax increase that was approved for the top 2% of the population. Of course, it is baffling why any among them would so focus on that small increase and neglect the fact that, with Obama's assistance, they managed to do what George W. Bush could not and make Bush's tax plan permanent. No matter, the posturing of Boehner & Co. is designed to make them appear resolute. Unfortunately, it only succeeds in making them look demented. They say growth is the key to balancing the budget, but are pursuing the one policy most likely to derail it. They say they want to balance the budget to improve America's credit rating and international standing, but they seem willing to do more to damage either than any other Congress in memory. They say they want to force budget cuts but won't touch defense spending, the largest and most bloated area of discretionary spending in the budget. They seem to assume that the president will offer some cuts and that they will be able to say their toughness won the day. They think the American people will believe their use of the debt ceiling as a cudgel was principled and perhaps even courageous. They will offer themselves up as protectors of the national economic well-being. Opinion: Senate holds key to fixing Washington . This is a lot like a kidnapper expecting to be seen as a hero for releasing his captive. Both parties bear plenty of responsibility for getting America in the fiscal mess we are in today. Both will have to compromise to achieve real progress. Taxes will have to rise more. Defense will have to be cut. Entitlements will have to be sweepingly reformed. Real compromise and courage and principles will be required to a greater extent than either party has embraced or even publicly discussed. But just because neither party has done all it should, that does not mean both are equally responsible for this bizarre and dangerous episode. As the president rightly asserted, and as reasonable people in either party must acknowledge, playing politics with the debt ceiling must be put permanently out of bounds. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: Obama challenged congressional GOP on debt ceiling .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Turkish troops fired artillery shells into northern Iraq on Wednesday nearly a week after Turkey completed its eight-day ground offensive targeting Kurdish militants, an Iraqi official told CNN. Turkish troops patrol near the border with Iraq during the February offensive. Jabbar Yawer, spokesman for Iraq's Kurdish Regional Government security forces, said at least 16 rounds were fired on Dashti Barzji -- an uninhabited area in Iraq's Irbil province located about 12 miles from Iraq's border. Irbil is one of the three provinces compromising Iraq's Kurdish region. The Turkish military in Ankara had no immediate comment about the report. Yawer said Turkish helicopters were seen in the area during the strike but said that the choppers were not involved in the attack. The border conflict has wider implications for the Middle East and Asia, with the United States concerned that prolonged cross-border fighting would serve to destabilize the region, where Kurdish separatists pose challenges to power in Iran and Syria, as well as  Turkey » and  Iraq ». The Turkish military for months has been conducting cross-border airstrikes and artillery fire in northern Iraq against members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK -- militants who have been launching attacks against Turkey from bases in northern Iraq. Turkish troops launched a ground offensive on the evening of Feb. 21 ""to prevent the region from being used as a safe haven by the terrorists and to contribute to the internal peace and stability of Iraq in the long run."" It was the first significant Turkish ground offensive into Iraq since the 2003 overthrow of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, and it ended after Iraqi and U.S. officials urged Turkey to make the foray as brief as possible. A total of 240 rebels, 24 troops, and three village guards were killed, the Turkish military said. The PKK has spent two decades fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey, with some of its attacks launched from inside northern Iraq. Turks regard the PKK militants as terrorists and point to indiscriminate PKK attacks against civilians as well as police and military targets over the years. The United States and the European Union also label the PKK a terrorist organization. U.S. officials have shared intelligence with Turkey. The Iraqi government opposes the PKK presence, but it views the Turkish military incursion as a violation of its sovereignty. E-mail to a friend .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian investigators were hunting Thursday for the assassin of a reputed Russian mafia kingpin who was fatally shot by a sniper outside a restaurant in central Moscow. Aslan Usoyan, also known as Granddad Khassan, was the target Wednesday afternoon of what appears to be a contract killing amid a gangland turf war, state media said. A restaurant worker injured in the shooting was in a critical condition Thursday, state-run Itar-Tass news agency reported, after being hit by two bullets. She suffered damage to her spine and lungs, and is on a ventilator, the news agency reported. A doctor told the state-run Russia 24 channel that the 30-year-old woman might not walk again. Russia's Investigative Committee, which is probing the attack, said the killer had used a VAL assault rifle fitted with a silencer. The weapon is standard issue for military special task force units, according to Itar-Tass. Usoyan, who was in his 70s, suffered a single bullet wound to the neck, the committee said. Two bodyguards who were with Usoyan administered first aid in the restaurant on Povarskaya Street, but their boss later died in the hospital. One bodyguard returned fire in the apparent direction of the shot but had to retreat into the building after coming under further fire from the assassin, the committee said. The assassin fled the scene without being caught. Investigators later found the spot where the killer had waited to take aim, the committee said -- a stairway between the fifth and sixth floors of a nearby building. Six shells were found there, along with a camp chair and piece of fabric. Involved in the criminal underworld since the 1960s, Usoyan had survived at least two previous attempts on his life, one in 1998 and the other in 2010, state-run RIA Novosti reported. He was involved in gambling, drug trafficking, illegal arms sales and extraction of mineral resources, it said, and controlled organized crime groups in Moscow and across the country. CNN's Alla Eshchenko and Phil Black in Moscow, and Laura Smith-Spark in London contributed to this report.","NEW: A restaurant worker injured in the shooting may be paralyzed, state media say .

"(CNN) -- Two civil lawsuits against the company that owns the private jet that crashed Sunday in northern Mexico -- presumably killing music star Jenni Rivera -- accuse the firm of lying about its links to a businessman convicted of falsifying maintenance records. Insurance firms QBE and Commerce & Industry Insurance Company filed suits this year seeking to rescind its contracts with aviation company Starwood Management because of alleged falsehoods. In short, the insurance companies claim that Starwood lied in its application for coverage about the history of the planes being insured and about the true owner of the company. Starwood is the owner of the Learjet that crashed Sunday in Mexico, most likely killing Rivera, who has not been found. DNA tests are currently being conducted to confirm the identities of the remains found at the crash site. Read more: Jenni Rivera is mourned, but still inspires . Rivera was a Mexican-American star with a rising cross-border appeal. She sang traditional Mexican ballads and was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award in 2002 in the category of ""Best Banda Album."" The lawsuits against Starwood focus on the man who signed the insurance paperwork on its behalf, Ed Nunez. Nunez's full name, the insurance companies claim, is Christian Edward Esquino Nunez, a businessman with a criminal record that includes falsifying airplane records. The registered owner of Starwood, Norma Gonzalez, or her representatives were not immediately available. In an unrelated lawsuit, Starwood admits that the company gave power of attorney to Ed Nunez to sign documents but denies that the man has any ownership or management role in the company. The sole member of Starwood is Norma Gonzalez, the court document states. The pair of lawsuits from the insurance companies, however, tell another story. The QBE lawsuit claims that Ed Nunez, also known as Christian Esquino, is the ""alter ego"" of Starwood, and that he is tied to the operations, assets and ownership of the firm in a way that makes him ""inseparable"" from the company. The convicted businessman's history may be troublesome to observers of Sunday's crash. Additional court records reviewed by CNN show that under the name Eduardo Nunez, the businessman was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2002 of falsifying logbooks to obtain airworthiness certificates from the Federal Aviation Administration. He pleaded guilty. Esquino, a Mexican national, pleaded guilty in 2004 of participating in a scheme in which he ""obtained a counterfeit Mexican inspection stamp, which was used to make entries in the fraudulently created logbooks, concerning the airworthiness for aircraft engines, propellers and airframes, as well as, certify completed 25-, 50- and 100-hour aircraft inspections,"" the criminal complaint states. He sold those planes at a higher price, according to court records. The Learjet in which Rivera was traveling, built in 1969, was not one of the aircraft cited in any of the legal action, records indicate. Another case filed against Esquino in 1993 resulted in a conviction for ""the concealment from the IRS of the existence, source and transfer of cash"" for which he was sentenced to five years in prison. According to court documents obtained by CNN, Esquino has a criminal record dating to 1991, when he pleaded guilty to one count of ""aiding and abetting a false loan application."" He was then sentenced to three years on probation. Opinion: America missed out on getting to know Jenni Rivera . In April 1991, Esquino was arrested and subsequently indicted on one count of ""conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine,"" according to court records. He pleaded guilty. The insurance companies claim that they would not have provided coverage for Starwood if they had known about such a criminal history. They allege that Esquino simply went by the name Nunez instead and failed to report his past. Civil aviation officials say they believe no one survived Sunday's crash. Yet Rivera's family says hope is the last thing to go. Authorities would not describe the condition of the remains but said they do not know how many people they belong to. The remains were found Tuesday at the site of the wreckage and were transported to Monterrey, the same city the private Learjet took off from, said Priscila Rivas, spokeswoman for the state's public ministry. It is too early to tell if Rivera's remains were among those found, Rivas said, but DNA tests are under way. Test results could take anywhere from a day to weeks, she said. Rivera's brother, Lupillo, arrived in Monterrey Tuesday from the family's home in Lakewood, California. Before he left California, he described the situation as ""95% bad news"" but added that the family is clinging to the small hope that Jenni Rivera somehow survived. A makeshift altar with flowers, balloons and candles appeared on the family's front lawn. ""I trust in God, and he gives me strength,"" said Rivera's mother, Rosa Rivera. ""I know that if indeed (she's dead), I would thank God for the time he shared her with me, for the precious time she called me Mother."" Six others, including two pilots, were thought to be on board the plane, which lost contact with air traffic controllers soon after takeoff. Born in Long Beach, California, to Mexican immigrant parents, Rivera, 43, released her debut album in 1999, according to her website. In October, People en Espanol named Rivera to its list of the 25 most powerful women. Famous for her music, she is also known for her tumultuous personal life. The singer was a single mom at the age of 15, is thrice-married and the mother of five, her website said. Rivera's ""I Love Jenni"" reality show began airing on Telemundo's mun2 network last year. She is a judge on the popular TV show ""The Voice Mexico,"" which was scheduled to air Sunday night on Televisa. Noting its concern for Rivera, Televisa said it would air a special report on the singer instead. ""To all her fans who are suffering, I say thank you, and don't suffer. Soon we will have news of her,"" Rosa Rivera said. Flashback: Jenni Rivera reflects on her success .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Pakistanis ended their sit-in in central Islamabad late Thursday night after their leader, Muslim cleric Tahir ul Qadri, convinced Pakistan's government to dissolve the National Assembly and set new elections. The cleric had repeatedly called for the government to be dissolved and replaced by a caretaker administration, with input from the judiciary and military. Qadri, who convoyed into town with thousands of followers on Monday, reached the deal with a 10-man delegation from the governing coalition after five-hour negotiations in a bulletproof shipping container. After Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf signed off of the agreement, Qadri praised his supporters, including women and children, who braved frigid winter rains for their cause. ""In the history of Islamabad, such a sea of people, patient and driven and united, has never been seen"" said Qadri, addressing the crowd outside his container. ""You are victorious, and your sacrifices were worth it in the end."" The agreement, named the ""Islamabad Long March Declaration,"" contains five main points: . First, the National Assembly must dissolve by March 16, so elections can take place within 90 days. Second, Qadri's Pakistan Awami Tehreek party will be able to propose two potential candidates for the caretaker prime minister post. Third, a meeting has been scheduled for January 27 to put together a national election commission. Fourth, there will be a focus on electoral reforms, including ensuring ""free, fair, just and honest elections guarded against all corrupt practices."" And finally, the government agreed not to pursue vendettas against any participants in Qadri's march or sit-in. The crowds that had paralyzed downtown Islamabad since Sunday began to disperse after Qadri's declaration of victory. He assured his supporters that transportation for their return home had been arranged and would be free of cost. The cleric began his protest movement last month in the eastern city of Karachi after returning from years of self-imposed exile in Canada. He originally had requested a personal meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari, and gave the head of state a 3 p.m. Thursday deadline. The president never showed. Instead, the 10-man delegation arrived, according to Pakistan's Information Ministry. Before Qadri met with the heads of coalition parties, four Cabinet ministers and other lawmakers, he warned his followers an agreement might not come quickly. ""You may need to sleep here another night, as we won't leave this place until there is a written agreement,"" he told the throngs. Growing fury over widespread corruption brought the government district to a standstill this week and jolted Pakistan's already volatile political scene ahead of national elections due later this year. The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the arrest of the prime minister and other officials in connection with a long-running corruption case. Read more: Pakistani Supreme Court orders arrest of PM . Cleric in Islamabad: 'It's the beginning of the revolution' Qadri's suggestion about judiciary and military involvement in Pakistan's future has raised concerns in the country, where military leaders have repeatedly seized power and ruled for long periods of time. Qadri was a lawmaker during the presidency of former president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. Some Pakistanis have suggested Qadri may be working on behalf of the military. He denies those allegations. Read more: Pakistani leader meets protesting families of bombing victims . The political drama unfolded against the backdrop of bomb and gun attacks in restive areas of the country carried out by the Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups.

If you're still searching for that elusive knockoff, that priceless $20 trinket, that vintage earthenware goblet -- above all, that authentic bazaar experience -- you can bet your top and bottom dollar you'll score big at one of the following, one-of-a-kind markets around the world. 1. FLEA . Rose Bowl Flea Market: Los Angeles . Every second Sunday of the month, 2,500 vendors and 20,000 hagglers gather outside Pasadena's storied Rose Bowl to barter over Eames chairs, Richard Pryor memorabilia, antique dental tools, art deco glassware and that autographed Aerosmith bootleg you've been hunting for.

Every beige-pants-wearing Southeast Asian traveler and their posse of touts flock to the far better known Damnoen Saduak Floating Market.

The swarm of spice sellers, masala merchants, paneer pushers, Vishnu figurine hawkers and every other imaginable purveyor and shopkeeper buried in the rickshaw and oxcart traffic of Old Delhi's timeless commercial artery, Chandni Chowk, erases all doubt that roads like New York's Canal Streetor L.A.'s Santee Alley are relatively young and tame. Best buys: Pick your specialized alley for clothes, fabrics, jewelry, leather goods or electronics and let the haggling begin.

"COCHISE COUNTY, Arizona (CNN) -- It was supposed to be 14 feet high and topped with razor wire. It was also supposed to send a message to Washington that if the government wouldn't seal off the southern border, volunteers could. Almost two years later, the reality is a five-strand barbed-wire barrier that ranchers dismiss as a mere cattle fence. The fence to help stop illegal immigration was the dream of Chris Simcox, the founder and president of the Minuteman Defense Corps. The group has chapters throughout the country, with Minuteman members from as far away as New Hampshire making the trip down to Arizona to participate in citizens' border patrols. They are doing a job Simcox says the federal government is not doing well enough. Simcox, who participated in border patrols as recently as October, has said, ""If elected officials will not lead, then it's up to the citizens."" Volunteers say they heeded Simcox's call because they believe illegal immigration is a grave threat to the security of the United States. They say that they are patriots hoping to make a difference and that they want to help make the United States safe in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11. ""Here we were, grandparents, and we were willing to go down to the border and do something our government wouldn't do,"" explained Sandy Doty, a former member of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps.  Watch how fence has not met volunteers' expectations » . On the Minuteman Web site and in e-mails to members, Simcox asked for donations while making big promises, including a vow to build a fence along the border. It was not just any fence; it was to be 2,000 miles of state-of-the-art fencing at a cost of $55 million. Simcox described it as ""our high-tech, double-layered gauntlet of deterrent."" The fence was described on the Minuteman Web site as 14 feet high, with security cameras and sensors, topped with razor wire and flanked by ditches to stop vehicles. Simcox referred to it as an ""Israeli-style"" fence, similar to the barrier Israel has erected to keep Palestinians from crossing from the West Bank. Many Minuteman state and national leaders said that the fence proposal was a complete surprise to them. ""All of a sudden we hear, 'We are going to build a fence if the government doesn't build it!' We all looked at each other and said, 'What!'"" said David Jones, a former Minuteman member. Donations started flowing in. One man actually mortgaged his home and contributed more than $100,000. And on Memorial Day of last year, there was a groundbreaking ceremony on John Ladd's Arizona ranch. But what the Minutemen were building was not a tall, Israeli-style fence. Former member Bob Wright said, ""It wasn't until they actually started the ceremony that it became clear. It was gonna be a cow fence!"" It was a five-strand barbed wire fence that would keep Ladd's cattle in and keep Mexican cattle out. Ladd said he is happy with the fence. But some Minuteman leaders were stunned. In their first-ever interview, these former Simcox lieutenants told CNN they believed that the groundbreaking was a ploy by Simcox to raise even more money. As a group, these leaders started to question Simcox about how donations were being spent. They wanted to him to provide specifics as to how much money was being raised and how it was being used. ""To this day, we still don't know how much the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps has raised. We don't have a clue, not a clue,"" Wright said. They said they wanted to know why the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps was not spending money to help volunteers patrol the borders. ""We needed equipment, and we were not getting equipment,"" Jones said. They demanded that Simcox meet them in person to address their concerns and answer their questions. They say he refused to meet with them and subsequently fired them. Simcox now says that he never promised to build the high-tech security fence on Ladd's ranch. And he insists the barbed-wire fence really does protect the country. As the Minutemen strung their wire on Ladd's property, another Arizona border rancher, Richard Hodges, agreed to allow Simcox to build nearly a mile of that Israeli-style fence on his land. That was 10 months ago. CNN visited Hodges' ranch a few weeks ago and found an as-yet-unfinished, tall, wire-mesh fence. There is no razor wire, no trenches, no cameras, which were to be the fancy facial-recognition type. In a news release, Simcox claimed an Alabama company was going to provide those cameras, but the company told CNN it has made no deal to provide cameras and hasn't heard from the Minutemen in 18 months. And what happened to all the money donated to the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps is in question. Simcox posted his group's most recent tax filing and an independent audit on the Minuteman Web site. In the audit, the largest expense listed, by far, is for ""professional services,"" with no further details given. Meanwhile, Simcox continues to solicit donations to build a fence. But, lately, it sounds as though he is lowering expectations, saying the fence is really just a symbol, a way to prod the government into building a real barrier. CNN asked Simcox for responses to all of the allegations made by the former insiders. He replied that all of the allegations, as well as CNN's investigation, are ""a witch hunt"" and ""part of a smear campaign."" Simcox declined several CNN requests for an interview. Paul Newman, the board supervisor of Cochise County, Arizona, where Simcox has been building his barbed wire fences, said Simcox's plan for a border fence was a pipe dream from the very beginning. He explained that because the border is a patchwork of public and private land, a private fence builder could never get permission to build on all of it. Not only would there be wide gaps all along a fence built by the Minutemen, but in October 2006, President Bush signed into law an authorization for nearly 700 miles of federal fence along the Mexico border.

Conte had taken his appeal to CONI after being handed his original ban by the Italian Football Federation. The disciplinary action related to his time in charge of Siena in the 2010-11 season. He was accused of not passing on knowledge of match fixing in games they played while in Serie B. Conte's assistant at Siena and Juventus, Angelo Alessio, has had his ban for his role in the affair reduced from eight months to six. The punishments were handed out as part of the 'Calcioscommesse' scandal, which has seen more than 20 Italian teams under the spotlight. Juventus president Andrea Agnelli welcomed the decision on the club's official website. ""I maintain my view, which is shared by everyone at Juventus, that Antonio Conte is an innocent man and in no way guilty of the charges leveled at him,"" said Agnelli. Conte's case was heard by the National Court of Arbitration for Sport (TNAS) and while reducing his ban, did not fully exonerate him of the charges against him. Agnelli is angry that Conte was not cleared and added: ""The confirmation of his suspension is an injustice which should prompt the entire footballing system to ask itself questions,"" he added. Conte, who took Juve to the title in his first season in charge, will have missed 15 Serie A matches and the entire Champions League group stage before his ban ends. But in his absence, Juventus have continued their fine form, topping the Italian standings on the same points as Napoli.","Antonio Conte has ban reduced from 10 months to four .

"New York (CNN) -- The wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faces a court date next week on a drunk driving charge, the latest in a string of events that began when Kennedy filed for divorce, according to records from Westchester County. Records from the Westchester County Clerk show that Kennedy filed for divorce from his wife, Mary Kennedy, on May 12. The next evening, according to police records, Bedford police responded to a 911 call. When police arrived at the Kennedy residence they found the couple in an argument over taking their four children to a carnival at St. Patrick's School. According to a ""domestic incident"" report filed by the officer on the scene, ""Mr. Kennedy stated that his wife was intoxicated and was acting irrational so he took the children to the carnival to remove them from the situation."" No one was injured, the report said. Two days later, Mary Kennedy was arrested for driving while intoxicated. Bedford Police Lt. Jeff Dickans told CNN that Mary was arrested around 9:15 p.m. on May 15. Dickans said that Bedford police officer Patricia McGraw saw Kennedy's 2004 Volvo swerving onto the curb of Greenwich Road in Bedford and asked her to pull over. Kennedy had slurred speech, and a blood-alcohol-content above 0.08 percent, the legal limit in New York. She was charged with driving while intoxicated. ""The DUI is pending and we're hopeful that we'll be able to resolve it in the future,"" her lawyer, Kerry Lawrence, told CNN. She is due to appear in Town Court on July 22. Lawrence declined to comment on the divorce filing. Reached through his assistant, Mary Beth Postman, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also declined to comment on the divorce.","Mary Kennedy faces court date June 22 on DUI charge .

"(CNN) -- Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick compared the alleged hoax about a ""girlfriend"" that ensnared linebacker Manti Te'o with the documentary ""Catfish."" ""Catfish"" is no longer simply a river dweller, but rather a verb defined as ""to pretend to be someone you're not online by posting false information, such as someone else's pictures, on social media sites usually with the intention of getting someone to fall in love with you,"" according to the MTV show of the same name. The show grew from the documentary in which filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman follow Ariel's brother Nev and his budding online relationship with ""Megan,"" according to the website Iamrogue.com. The three started to suspect that something wasn't quite right with Megan, and they set out to solve the mystery, capturing everything on film. The documentary was a hit at the 2010 Sundance film festival, Iamrogue says. On the TV show, Nev Schulman, a photographer, guides others who suspect that their online loves are not what they seem. ""So someone will reach out to me and say, 'I'm really into this guy, we've been talking online for months. He lives far away, we can't afford to meet but we definitely want to, I think he is the one. Can you help?'"" Nev Schulman said in an interview with Iamrogue. ""Will they find love or heartache?"" the show's introduction asks. In one episode, ""Tyler"" wants to meet ""Amanda"" after months of corresponding via Facebook. Amanda always has an excuse for not meeting or talking, such as not having a cell phone or having a broken webcam. Suspicious, Tyler writes to Schulman. Through a reverse photo search, Schulman discovers that Amanda's pictures belong to someone else. Schulman follows the trail and finds that ""Amanda"" is really Aaron, who is having trouble coming to terms with being gay. ""For many people the life that they lead on the Internet, which can be exciting, interesting, and can be filled with hopes and dreams that are perhaps outside of the actual range of their situation, is a big distraction and keeps them from living their real lives,"" Schulman said in the Iamrogue interview.","Alleged hoax on Manti Te'o is compared with the documentary ""Catfish""

"(EW.com) -- Heavy may be the head that wears the crown, but hot is the head that's third in line. Prince Harry, 28, has been named the Top Bachelor, according to the editors at Town & Country, which named the current top 50 bachelors in the world. ""Prince William's baby brother flirts and flies Apache helicopters with equal aplomb,"" the magazine wrote. The list isn't very Hollywood specific (although both George Clooney and Jack Nicholson made the cut). Instead, in addition to the prince, people like Ralph Lauren's son, Andrew, President Obama's speechwriter Jon Favreau, and Greek shipping heir Stavros Niarchos (who has dated both Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton) snagged a spot. Most hilariously, still-just-a-high-schooler Conor Kennedy made the cut.

It's hard to make an argument against Harry's No. 1 ranking (although seeing all the attention the Duchess of Cambridge receives on a daily basis could make some women want to run for the hills). More so than normal, Harry has been in the public eye this year, whether he was losing his clothes in Las Vegas or cheering on Olympians at the London Games. ""Harry might not possess a towering intellect,"" the magazine explained. ""But he is cooler and more appealing than his older brother, sweet as William undoubtedly is."" You guys!

"Delhi, India (CNN) -- The case against five men charged with the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in Delhi has been moved to a fast-track court for trial, lawyers for the defendants said Friday. The case is scheduled to begin Monday, they said. A sixth suspect will be tried in a youth court if it is confirmed he is a minor. In the December 16 incident, passengers and the driver of a bus allegedly attacked the woman and her male companion, robbed them and dumped them by the side of the road. The badly beaten woman was flown to Singapore for treatment after the attack. She died about two weeks later while undergoing treatment. The five men are charged with murder, rape and kidnapping and face the death penalty if convicted. A juvenile court is determining the age of a sixth suspect, who has said he is 17, too young to be tried as an adult. The government has pledged to strengthen laws against sexual assaults. The number of reported rapes in India -- a country where a cultural stigma keeps many victims from reporting the crime -- has increased from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011, according to official figures. Most women in India have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, said Seema Sirohi, of the Indian Council on Global Relations.","The case against five men is to begin Monday, lawyers for the defendants say .

"Washington (CNN) -- On the eve of the inauguration, President Barack Obama's second term may also be America's second chance. The country, in the last four years, has been battered by an economic earthquake while trying to reconcile a debt load threatening to cripple the next generation. It has been pulled apart by political extremism and the inability to compromise in Washington. The people have been divided -- by demographic shifts, cultural battles and clashes between the rich and the poor, the haves and the have-nots. So, days before the president's second inaugural, the nation, too, is set to regroup. What it does differently this time around and the decisions the people make, experts say, will speak to the kind of America that emerges during the next four years. Second inaugural address puts Obama in select company . ""The enormous promise that everyone felt four years ago, it isn't completely gone but we have diminished our horizons,"" said Robert Schmuhl, an American studies professor at the University of Notre Dame. ""We have learned that we are now living in an era of limits.""Obama is perhaps more keenly aware of this than most. Hope and hurdles . The 44th President was ushered into the Oval Office by a wave of seemingly limitless optimism and buoyed by the historic nature of his presidency as the first African American elected to the lead the free world. But once in office, he found his efforts to right an economy hobbled by high unemployment -- 10% at its worse in 2009 -- and home foreclosure rates -- one in 29 homes were in foreclosure between 2007 and 2012 -- were limited by the magnitude of the problem and the political realities of a partisan Congress. His plan to reform the nation's healthcare system further expanded political divides in Washington and helped lead to huge losses among his party's moderates in the 2010 election. His re-election this fall — due in no small part to demographic shifts that included large numbers of minorities and women — was quickly followed by a protracted and deeply partisan showdown over trimming the nation's debt. By the numbers: Presidential inaugurations . ""I think Obama has learned some things,"" said Curtis Gans, director of American University's Center for the Study of the American Electorate. ""He's going to be unlike most second term presidents in that he will be far more assertive than he was in his first term. He will be stronger on pushback against some of the most extreme elements in the Republican House. He's willing to go to battle on the whole concept of getting the economy moving."" The public saw hints of that assertiveness on Monday during a surprise news conference, where he lashed out at Republicans in Congress for playing politics with the debt ceiling. ""We are not a deadbeat nation,"" Obama said during a nearly hour-long briefing from the East Room of the White House. It a newly combative tone, he called it ""absurd"" for the federal government not to pay ""bills that have already been racked up"" and said he will not negotiate ""with a gun at the head of the American people."" From Obamacare to the economy to Sandy Hook . Over the next four years, the country will also get a chance to see whether the Affordable Care Act -- or ""Obamacare"" -- is a positive or negative step for the nation. In 2014, many of the most controversial provisions, including requiring individuals to either participate in a health insurance program or pay a penalty, take effect. ""We will see whether or not we have the strength within ourselves to figure out how we should deal with entitlement programs,"" Schmuhl said. ""In a way, it's a period when the administration will be dealing with problems that are in process."" Obama's ability -- or failure -- to navigate all of this while coming off as a strong, levelheaded leader could help set the nation's tone for years to come. ""If the economy becomes more robust you will have no doubt he will point back and say see that's what I was doing,"" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and CNN contributor. Reagan, Clinton faced similar issues . It's what happened when former President Ronald Reagan, who led the nation at a time when the country was reeling from a tough economy and just starting to get over the Vietnam War. In his second term ""there was a sense America was moving in the right direction in terms of how it was doing around the globe,"" Zelizer said. When former President Bill Clinton took office the economy wasn't doing well, but by the second term the economy was picking up, allowing him to deliver a balanced budget and ultimate surplus by the end of his presidency. ""There was clearly a shift in the mood,"" Zelizer said. ""In both cases, the presidents were good at claiming credit for it."" Mood matters in the age of austerity . Everyday folks have learned to cut back and suck it up—some after finding themselves underwater on mortgages they could not afford to pay; others after losing jobs that their companies could no longer afford to keep. So, Americans have been using their credit cards less and paying down debt more -- household debt as a percentage of disposable personal income is at its lowest rate in almost 30 years, according to the Federal Reserve and credit card balances had reached their lowest level in more than a decade. And many expect the same discipline from their government. ""Americans will be realistic, just as those in government need to be realistic,"" Schmuhl said of citizens' likely approach to their own finances over the next four years. But, as Obama enters his second term, both the housing and job markets have been on a slow and steady uptick. Housing sales were up 6% in 2012 -- the biggest gain since 2005, according to CoreLogic -- and the unemployment rate had dropped to 7.8% in December, although there are still 4.8 million Americans -- or 39.1% of the jobless -- classified as long-term unemployed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ""Going into the second term, the fiscal situation will continue the agenda and the discussion,"" he said. ""It will say a lot about us and where not only the government but the nation might be going. If it is difficult and, shall we say, fractured and there's a sense coming out of it that things are not working as they should my guess is that the public will begin saying: 'When will Washington work on our behalf?'"" Governing on a deadline . That sentiment was foreshadowed in the frustration over the down-to-the-wire, partisan political maneuvering as the last Congress sought to avert the fiscal cliff's steepest domestic spending cuts. Obama appeared to prevail on that skirmish, delivering on a promise to raise tax rates on wealthy Americans -- although he shifted his definition of ""wealthy"" from those making $250,000 or more to those making $400,000 and up. According to Pew Research Center and Gallup polls, Americans were none too impressed with how lawmakers handled the negotiations or the deal that was struck. Some 41% of those polled disapproved of the deal, according to Pew, and 52% thought the deal would hurt people like them. In the Gallup poll, 67% - disapproved of congressional Republicans' handled the negotiations while 55% disapproved of how Democrats performed. Still, partly due to deliberate redistricting to protect -- or create -- more partisan congressional districts, American voters continued to elect or re-elect safe representatives to do their bidding in Congress. For instance, most of the 435 members of the House of Representatives -- Republicans and Democrats -- faced little real opposition on Election Day in 2012. Other battlegrounds: Sequester, gun control, immigration . But the next battle looms. Just weeks after Obama takes his oath of office, a new Congress will be tasked with addressing the automatic spending cuts, or sequester, that were kicked down the road in order to pass a smaller deal at the end of the year. The new Congress will also consider raising the nation's debt ceiling, or the ability of the U.S. Treasury to borrow money to pay America's bills. Most agree that defaulting on the nation's obligations would be disastrous for America and the global economy, but some Republicans in Congress are starting to hint that they may be prepared to let that happen anyway if large spending cuts are not secured. And after that, the fight over gun control, a high priority for the White House in the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre, will pit the president against many members of the House and Senate from safe districts with high ratings and big-dollar donations from gun rights advocates. The president and vice president unveiled a major plan on Wednesday that included 23 executive actions the president has ordered on his own, while urging the new Congress to take on the meaty issues of an assault weapons ban, limits on the number of bullets a gun magazine can hold, and other sweeping reforms the gun lobby and others say would gut the constitutional right to bear arms. Immigration reform, another White House priority, will also stoke ideological differences and test the demographic shifts in Congress. For the first time, the House Democratic caucus is dominated by women and racial minorities, while the Republican caucus in that chamber is largely composed of white men. In the Senate, 20 women — the largest number in history — currently hold office. But women and minorities are far outnumbered and outranked by white males on some of the most powerful congressional committees. And despite several high-ranking exceptions, Obama's Cabinet -- so far -- is shaping up to be largely male and white. ""The first thing we learned is that we're not post-race. That was a lot of willful imagining in '08 that his election would allow us to transcend these questions of race,"" said Mark Anthony Neal, a cultural and Black studies professor at Duke University. ""The American electorate is looking different in terms of race and ethnicity and young folks being engaged. In 2016 our political realities will look more like our demographic realities."" And that's where the nation's shift over the next four years may be most visible. But look first to the 2014 midterms and then the 2016 presidential election to see if the people signal continued frustration with the current regime -- in Congress and in the White House -- or demonstrate through the power of their vote that they feel the nation has finally turned the corner.","Reeling from the turmoil of the last four years, the country may be ready to regroup .
President Obama, adopting a more assertive posture, will need to still persuade a divided country to get things done .
The economy is improving, the nation's demographics are shifting and a new America is emerging ."
"Editor's note: Peter Bregman is chief executive of Bregman Partners Inc., a global management consulting firm, and the author of ""Point B: A Short Guide to Leading a Big Change"". He writes a weekly column, How We Work, for HarvardBusiness.org. Peter Bregman says you can't make your luck, but you can control how you'll react to what happens. NEW YORK (CNN) -- There is a Buddhist story about a poor farmer whose one horse ran away. All his neighbors came to him in sympathy, saying ""What bad luck!"" ""Maybe,"" he responded. The next day the horse returned with several other wild horses. ""What great luck!"" his neighbors exclaimed. ""Maybe,"" he responded. A few days later the farmer's son was trying to tame one of the wild horses when he was thrown off and broke his leg. ""What terrible luck!"" his neighbors said. ""Maybe,"" he responded. A week later the army came through the village to draft all the young men but seeing the broken leg of the farmer's son, they left him in peace. ""What wonderful luck!"" the neighbors said. ""Maybe,"" the farmer responded. And so it goes. My life is a series of lucky accidents strung together starting from the moment of my conception. I was a diaphragm baby. In college I was planning to go into politics. Then in the spring of my junior year the bicycle trip I had planned to go on was cancelled because the leader broke her arm. So instead I went on a camping trip and it changed my life. I soon gave up politics and began teaching leadership on wilderness expeditions. And on one of those expeditions I met the woman who would eventually become my wife. Later I built a successful company teaching leadership with lots of employees and several offices around the world. Then, as luck would have it, my company crashed along with the economy and the Twin Towers. It turns out, after some introspection and a solid dose of therapy, that I wasn't enjoying the business the way I had built it the first time. So I rebuilt it in a much smaller, sustainable and fulfilling way. While I might not have been happy about it at the time, each turn of luck was a catalyst that brought me closer to the life that I'm happily living now. Often we operate with the impression that we are in control of our lives. I remember long conversations with my wife, Eleanor, about exactly when we should have our second child. Two miscarriages later we realized it wasn't up to us. And when Sophia eventually came, we knew that any time would have been the right time. Some strokes of luck are small. Maybe you enjoy a conversation with someone new. Maybe you read a poem that happened to be sitting on someone's desk. Maybe you bump into the car in front of you. Only years later can you see how fundamentally that moment may have changed your life. Some strokes of luck are big and you know at the time they will change your life. Maybe you win $10 million with a lottery ticket you didn't even know you had, as recently happened to a woman in Australia. Maybe you lose your job. What we don't know is how those things will change our lives. All the research points to how poor we are at predicting how we'll feel about something once it happens to us. Lottery winners are no happier than before. Paraplegics are no less happy. And there's something I've been noticing about people who have lost their jobs recently. They seem happier. Relieved, almost. Not everyone. But in many cases, the fear of losing your job is worse than losing your job. I know a large number of employed people who are miserable on two counts: They hate their jobs and they're afraid of losing them. They're scared and stuck. But once you lose your job you can move on. Daniel Gilbert, professor of psychology at Harvard University, explained this phenomenon in a recent New York Times article, ""What You Don't Know Makes You Nervous."" ""When we get bad news we weep for a while, and then get busy making the best of it. We change our behavior, we change our attitudes. ... An uncertain future leaves us stranded in an unhappy present with nothing to do but wait."" So when your luck changes, what should you do about it? Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck has done a tremendous amount of research to understand what makes someone give up in the face of adversity versus strive to overcome it. Her research shows that if someone believes his talent is inborn he'll give up quickly, because any obstacle is a sign of his limitation. He's hit a wall; he can't do something and won't ever be able to. But if someone believes her talent grows with persistence and effort, she'll work to master the challenge. She'll view adversity as an opportunity to get better. So here's the good news: You can change your results by changing your mind-set. When Dweck trained children to view themselves as capable of growing their intelligence, they worked harder, more persistently, and with greater success on math problems they had previously abandoned as unsolvable. Luck changes. Call it fate. Call it God's will. Call it an accident. No matter how well we plan our lives, we're not fully in control. But how we face our luck -- good and bad -- is in our control. How's this year going? Are you having good luck? Bad luck? Maybe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bregman.","Peter Bregman: So much of our lives is ruled by luck .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- French forces swooped into Somalia for a rescue mission under the cover of darkness, leading to a fierce gunbattle with militants who officials fear killed the hostage, a French intelligence commando. The raid Friday night also left a French soldier and 17 Islamist fighters dead, according to the French defense ministry. Another soldier was missing. French President Francois Hollande acknowledged Saturday that the operation ""did not succeed."" He said it led to the ""sacrifice"" of two French soldiers -- the one killed and other missing -- and ""maybe the assassination"" of hostage Denis Allex, who was a member of the DGSE, France's equivalent of the CIA. French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also told reporters in Paris on Saturday that ""everything leads us to believe that Denis Allex was gunned down by his captors."" But the al-Shabaab militia, which is affiliated with al Qaeda, claimed that the hostage is unharmed and being held at a new location. The militants said in a statement on their Twitter account that they will decide the hostage's fate in the next two days. Profile: Who are Al-Shabaab? The racket of helicopter blades and volleys of gunfire startled Bulo Marer town residents out of their sleep Friday night, when French paratroopers descended on the camp. Three helicopters initiated a heated gunbattle with captors under the cover of darkness in the town about 75 miles northwest of the capital Mogadishu, eyewitnesses said. French soldiers leaped from the aircraft to engage the Islamists on the ground. Al-Shabaab 'recruiting U.S. citizens' The French commandos faced strong resistance from the outset, the defense ministry said in a statement. ""In the course of the assault, fierce fighting took place."" Al-Shabaab claimed the French soldiers left behind combat gear and a wounded comrade before disengaging. ""The injured French soldier is now in the custody of the Mujahideen,"" al-Shabaab said. Allex was abducted on July 14, 2009, while on an official mission in Mogadishu in support of the transitional Somali government, the French defense ministry said. French media reports suggest that Denis Allex is a pseudonym for the military serviceman. France said it decided to undertake the rescue attempt after the terror group failed to negotiate for the hostage's release for three and a half years while holding him in inhumane conditions. ""After an intensive search, which I want to salute, the intelligence service detected the location where he was held,"" Le Drian, France's defense minister, said Saturday. ""... France will never withhold any means to gain the release of all of its hostages."" Le Drian expressed his sympathy to the families of the French servicemen lost in the attempted rescue. The defense minister added that there was no connection between the operation in Somalia and a simultaneous deployment of French troops to Mali. A French helicopter pilot was fatally wounded during aerial raids in support of Malian forces combating Islamist forces Friday afternoon. New home for Somalia?

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal authorities are looking for a Delta Air Lines passenger who they say caused an uproar aboard a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Tuesday. According to a criminal complaint, Jared Layne Hansen faces charges of interfering with a flight crew, making false statements about having weapons and saying the plane was being hijacked, and assaulting federal air marshals. An arrest warrant was issued. Hansen, 31, from Salt Lake City, Utah, was sitting in seat 10B of the main cabin of Delta Flight 235. The trouble began, according to an affidavit filed by air marshal Dennis Scott, when Hansen tried to go into the front section of the cabin, which is restricted to business class passengers for security reasons. Hansen refused to obey instructions from the flight crew that he go back to his seat or to a bathroom in the rear cabin, the document alleges. ""Mr. Hansen threatened to urinate in the aircraft galley and grabbed his penis and threatened to urinate all over himself,"" according to the criminal complaint. Crew members summoned air marshals on the flight, saying they needed help with a passenger who appeared ""heavily intoxicated"" and was not behaving as requested. The court document says one marshal found Hansen standing in the galley exposing his genitals. When the officer approached him, the complaint said, Hansen clinched his fists and started hitting himself in the face. The marshals identified themselves as police officers and Hansen shoved two of them, the affidavit states. The marshals handcuffed Hansen and put him in his assigned seat. Hansen allegedly made a variety of false statements during the remainder of the flight -- sometimes yelling them out -- such as ""this is a hijacking."" He allegedly claimed to have a handgun and a bomb. According to the complaint, he also said the air marshals aboard the plane were hijacking the plane and called them terrorists. Four marshals were on Flight 235. The statements frightened the passengers, the document states, adding Hansen allegedly threatened the air marshals by saying he would ""track us down."" Hansen was detained and questioned by law enforcement upon arrival Tuesday in Detroit, but he was not arrested. ""We needed to do more investigation before we filed a criminal complaint,"" said Gina Balaya, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit. Kim Thompson, an official with the Federal Air Marshal Service, said she could not discuss the case and referred all questions to Justice Department officials.","Complaint: Passenger didn't go back to his seat when asked .

"INDIAN WELLS, California (CNET) --  -- Billionaire and clean-energy proponent T. Boone Pickens said that the U.S. should establish a federally funded loan program, or bank, to finance large-scale wind developments. T. Boone Pickens says the U.S. should create a federal loan program to finance wind projects, like his own. Pickens spoke on Wednesday at the Clean-Tech Investor Summit here where he talked about his Pickens Plan for reducing imports of foreign oil. He also offered a number of energy policy recommendations. His plan, launched in July, calls for spending $150 billion over the next 10 years to install turbines in the ""wind corridor"" of the Midwest United States, from Texas to Canada. The other major plank of the plan is to convert vehicles to run on domestic natural gas. In both areas -- wind and natural gas -- Boone has business interests. If completed, his Mesa Power wind project will make 4,000 megawatts of electricity, which would make it one of the largest wind farms, capable of powering 1.3 million homes. Boone has made a down payment on $2 billion worth of General Electric wind turbines, which are set for delivery in 2011. The credit crisis, however, has disrupted the financing for the project, although Boone still thinks the project will get done. ""There's no money to finance it, but I think it's all going to happen. I'm an optimistic entrepreneur type,"" he said. To help wind developers and achieve the Pickens Plan target of 20 percent of electricity from wind, Boone said that the U.S. government should establish a ""wind bank"" that would give wind developers loans. A wind bank would be a ""fraction"" of the projected $825 million in federal spending on a stimulus package, he said. It would also be cheaper than continuing to spend money on foreign oil, he argued. Pickens says he is not opposed to other clean energy technologies, like battery-powered cars. But heavy-duty vehicles can't run on batteries effectively. One diesel garbage truck emits as much pollution as 350 cars. To overcome that, he proposes an investment of $28 billion to purchase 350,000 heavy trucks that run on natural gas. The fueling infrastructure will follow once those trucks are on the road and corporations start to replace their fleets. ""You cannot get to the conclusion that we can reduce foreign oil in a significant way without using natural gas,"" he said. The oil tycoon and life-long Republican has advised a number of politicians on how to cut oil imports. He has also spent $58 million on a public awareness campaign, which he says is successful because the media and politicians now regularly talk about energy. Back story on the Pickens Plan . In a briefing with reporters, Pickens offered some color on how he decided to launch the plan. He met with former President Bush in April 2008 to urge him to adopt the core ideas of the Pickens Plan and establish an ""energy legacy."" Bush's response, according to Boone, was that he wouldn't have enough time to meet the goals. Six weeks later, Boone had still gotten no response from the Bush administration. One night at two o'clock in the morning, he woke his wife up and told her: ""Somebody's got to do this."" Shortly after, he began work on the public awareness campaign. ""I said, 'Hell, it's up to me.' I honestly felt it was the patriotic thing to do. I'm 80, I got the money to do it, so let's just go ahead and do it,"" he explained. He said if current trends continue, the U.S. will be importing 75 percent of its oil in 2019--more than today--and be paying high prices--in the $200 to $300 range--because of the supply cannot keep up with the demand. In doing focus groups in conjunction with launching the Pickens Plan, the billionaire found that many Americans don't believe what politicians say about energy. But he said he doesn't fault them. ""They're not lying. They really don't understand energy,"" he said. Pickens met with Barack Obama during the campaign and has met with his transition team twice. He says it's clear that the administration is committed to green technology. ""(Obama) is a charismatic guy. I think he can pull it off and it will bring everybody together,"" he said. © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- Strong support from young and minority voters propelled Barack Obama on the road to the White House, exit polls showed Tuesday. Students wait in a long line to vote Tuesday on the campus of the University of Central Florida. Voters in the 18 to 24 age group broke 68 percent for Obama to 30 percent for John McCain, according to the exit polling. Those in the 25 to 29 age bracket went 69 percent to 29 percent in Obama's favor. The only age group where McCain prevailed was 65 and over, and that by just a 10-percentage-point margin, 54 percent to 44 percent, the exit polls showed. And minorities went heavily into the Obama camp. Blacks, 96 percent Obama to 3 percent McCain; Latinos, 67 percent Obama to 30 percent McCain; and Asians, 63 percent Obama to 34 percent McCain. Obama did well with Latinos because they appear to disapprove of President Bush's job performance more than the rest of the country, CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said.  Watch CNN's Bill Schneider explain the Latino impact » . About 80 percent of Latinos give Bush negative marks, while 72 percent of all Americans do, exit polling showed. Race played less of a role in the election than age, exit polls showed. While Obama is projected to be the nation's first black president, John McCain would have been the oldest person ever elected to the nation's highest office. Twice as many of those polled Tuesday said age was an important factor in their vote as those who said race was. Among those factoring age into their vote, 78 percent went for Obama to 21 percent for McCain, exit polls showed. Those who said race was an important factor voted 55 percent to 44 percent in favor of Obama. But Obama also was the winner by a similar margin among those who said race was not important, ""which suggests that race was not a decisive factor in this election,"" Schneider said. The economy was the top issue in the election among 62 percent of voters questioned in exit polls on Tuesday. It was far ahead of the second-place issue, the Iraq war, which was named as the top concern of 10 percent of voters polled. Those who picked the Iraq war as their top issue mostly voted for  Obama in all but two states, according to the early exit polling results. Health care and terrorism were tied at 9 percent as the issue voters were most concerned about, according to the exit polling. Those who picked terrorism as their top concern overwhelmingly choose  McCain, according to exit polling. In early exit polling, first-time voters were breaking overwhelmingly for Obama over McCain by a 72 percent to 27 percent margin.  Watch what first-time voters had to say in Florida » . High income voters -- those who said they make at least $100,000 a year -- went in Obama's favor, 52 percent to 47 percent. Many of those polled said they expect a post-election tax increase, with 49 percent predicting their taxes will rise no matter who is elected president. Another 22 percent said taxes will go up only if Obama wins, and 12 percent said taxes will go up only if McCain wins. Only 15 percent said their taxes will stay the same or go down. A bare majority of those surveyed -- 51 percent -- think the government should do more to solve problems. Forty-three percent believe the government is doing too much. At the same time, early exit polling shows only a minority of voters -- 40 percent -- support the $700 billion government plan to assist failing financial companies. Fifty-six percent are opposed.  Watch CNN's Bill Schneider explain how the economy dominated voter concerns » . GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin didn't do well in exit polls. Sixty percent of those polled said the Alaska governor is not qualified to be president if necessary; 38 percent said she is. That compares with the two-thirds of those polled who said Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden is qualified to be president and the 31 percent who said he isn't.  Watch CNN's Jack Cafferty ask what issue is most important » . Many voters told the pollsters that they made up their minds early in the campaign season, with 61 percent saying they made up their minds before September, another 13 percent saying they decided in September and 17 percent saying they made their selection last month. Only 7 percent of those polled decided whom to support within the last three days. Exit polling also showed that Democrats who supported Sen. Hillary Clinton during the primaries overwhelming voted for Obama in the general election, 84 percent to 15 percent for McCain. For the poll, more than 16,000 people who had just voted were selected at random to fill out questionnaires.

"Denver (CNN) -- The university psychiatrist who treated the accused gunman in last year's deadly Colorado theater rampage could face more than a dozen lawsuits that blame her and the school for not properly handling James Holmes' treatment. At least 14 people have filed legal documents indicating they are planning to sue the University of Colorado Denver and Dr. Lynne Fenton for negligence. Holmes, 25, was a doctoral student in neuroscience at the university. Fenton has testified that her contact with Holmes ended on June 11, more than a month before he allegedly walked into a crowded movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, and opened fire, killing 12 people and wounding 58 others during a screening of the new Batman film. She said she later contacted campus police because she was ""so concerned"" about what happened during her last meeting with him, but she declined to detail what bothered her. Many details of Fenton's interactions with Holmes have been withheld due to rules governing doctor-patient confidentiality. Report: Fenton reported behavior to colleagues . Jacque Montgomery, a university spokeswoman, said university officials are aware of the pending lawsuits. ""We understand that there is pain and frustration amongst the families of the deceased and victims of this terrible crime and we have great sympathy for them,"" Montgomery said in a statement. ""We do believe, as well, that the facts will speak for themselves as the legal process moves forward."" Chantel Blunk -- whose 26-year-old husband, Jonathan, was one of 12 people slain in the theater -- has already filed a civil lawsuit in federal court accusing Fenton of knowing ""that James Holmes was dangerous"" and having ""a duty to use reasonable care to protect the public at large from James Holmes."" Blunk's lawsuit accuses Fenton of negligence and said the university is also liable. The lawsuit says that during their last contact on June 11, Holmes told Fenton that ""he fantasized about killing a lot of people."" But according to the lawsuit, when a police officer asked whether Holmes should be placed on a psychiatric hold for 72 hours, Fenton ""rejected the idea."" Therapists walk fine line in reporting violent plans . Stefan Moton, one of the 14 planning to sue the school and Fenton, survived a bullet wound in the July 20 shooting that left him paralyzed from the neck down. According to his court filing, Moton claims that Fenton ""learned of Mr. Holmes' dangerous propensities and intentions"" but, after bringing her concerns to the university, ""neither the (university) team nor the (university) police took action to prevent Mr. Holmes from causing ... harm to Mr. Moton, which harm could have been prevented from but for their failure to so act."" Moton is seeking at least $50 million in damages. Erik Novo and his wife Laura Rodriquez -- who plan to seek $250,000 in their lawsuit -- never even saw the shooter. They were in a different auditorium and fled along with other theatergoers. As they were driving away they say they were stopped by a police officer at gunpoint, which -- according to their notice of claim -- caused them ""severe mental anguish and suffering."" In all, the lawsuits will seek damages ranging from $100,000 to $50 million. More on the Colorado theater shooting . Holmes is currently awaiting formal arraignment for 166 charges related to the July 20 rampage, including murder, attempted murder and weapons offenses. His interactions with Fenton before the shooting have come up several times during court proceedings. Just nine minutes before he burst into the suburban mall movie theater, Holmes tried to call Fenton but failed to reach her, prosecutors have said. In September, a judge ruled that a notebook Holmes allegedly mailed to Fenton right before the shooting would not be accessible to prosecutors. The judge overseeing Holmes's case agreed last week to delay an arraignment in the case to allow defense lawyers more time to examine more than 30,000 pages of evidence and hundreds of DVDs and CDs. The arraignment -- a formal reading of charges by the court and, frequently, the entering of a plea by the defendant -- is now scheduled for March 12. Nearly six months after the killings, the Aurora Century 16 movie theater where the massacre took place will hold a private ""night of remembrance"" Thursday for the victims and those who responded to the tragedy. The theater will permanently reopen later this month. Some survivors and loved ones of those killed are boycotting Thursday's event, deeming it as insensitive, while others say it's important that the theater reopen. Several victims' families and survivors have filed lawsuits against Cinemark USA, Inc., the company that owns the theater.","14 people intend to sue university, psychiatrist who treated suspected shooter .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Benitez was only just beginning to win over Chelsea's supporters -- now he'll have to do it all over again. The Spaniard, who replaced Roberto Di Matteo as interim manager at Stamford Bridge in November, could only look on in horror as his side suffered a humiliating home defeat by Queens Park Rangers. It will do little for Benitez's popularity with many Chelsea supporters still angry at the removal of Di Matteo and the arrival of the former Liverpool manager. ""A lot of things went wrong today,"" Benitez told reporters. ""We knew we were playing against the bottom of the table side and we spoke about that. ""We knew we had to be focused but we did not have the tempo and some players may have been tired. ""It was going wrong against a side who played deep and were organized."" This was supposed to be a routine victory for Chelsea against a Rangers side which had managed just one league victory all season. Redknapp returns to EPL management with QPR job . Bottom of the table and favorite for relegation, Harry Redknapp's side faced its west London rival as huge underdog. After all, last season's European Champions League winners had won their four previous league games, including an impressive 2-1 triumph at Everton last Sunday. Even with Benitez's decision to rest the likes of Eden Hazard, Ashley Cole, Ramires and Juan Mata, Chelsea was expected to see off a QPR side which had already lost 12 of its 20 league games. Not since 1979 had Rangers won in the top-flight at Stamford Bridge and few gave them a chance of claiming a first away success of the league campaign on this occasion. After conceding three goals against Liverpool during an embarrassing first half performance on Sunday, there was a more resilient look to this QPR side. The home side were fortunate not to be reduced to ten men on four minutes when Marko Marin threw himself into a wild and dangerous challenge on Stephane Mbia. The Germany winger was shown only a yellow card for the tackle, which could easily have resulted in a straight red. While Chelsea had plenty of possession and worked goalkeeper Julio Cesar on a couple of occasions, the home side was unable to muster that moment of magic to claim the lead. Lampard double inspires Chelsea . Lampard thought he had put his side ahead on 66 minutes only for his effort to be ruled out for offside. Chelsea's failure to turn possession into goals allowed their opponent to grow in confidence. Suddenly, QPR began to look dangerous on the counter-attack, soaking up pressure before pushing forward in search of an unlikely winner. That winner did eventually come with 12 minutes remaining and when it arrived, it was provided by a man who used to wear the Chelsea blue. Shaun Wright-Phillips, who spent three years with the club between 2005-2008, showed his former employers how to finish, slamming home from 20-yards to send shockwaves around Stamford Bridge. The result leaves QPR five points adrift of safety with league games against Tottenham, West Ham and Manchester City to come this month. Quite what Chelsea's prospective signing Demba Ba thought of the team's performance is unknown, but with the Newcastle striker sat in the stands, the Blues flattered to deceive. While Ba was busy watching Chelsea, Newcastle was suffering a 2-1 home defeat by Everton. Papiss Cisse had given Newcastle a second minute lead before Leighton Baines' stunning free-kick and Victor Anichebe's strike won it for Everton. David Moyes' side are now just two points behind fourth place Chelsea, while Newcastle sits two points above the relegation zone. Chelsea striker Sturridge joins Liverpool . Elsewhere, Liverpool cruised to a 3-0 win over Sunderland thanks to two goals from Luis Suarez. The Uruguay international took his tally to 15 Premier League goals for the season with Raheem Sterling having opened the scoring on 19 minutes. Liverpool, which completed the $19.6 million signing of Chelsea striker Daniel Sturridge Wednesday, now sits eighth in the table. Manager Brendan Rodgers also confirmed that midfielder Joe Cole is holding talks with former club West Ham after enduring an unsuccessful spell at Anfield. He told reporters: ""I spoke to Joe earlier. He is a really good lad and has been brilliant during my time here in terms of as a human being. ""He is obviously speaking with West Ham at the moment and if they can get something organised, it will be a terrific move for Joe.""","Chelsea loses at home against bottom of table Queens Park Rangers .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to seeking public redemption for crimes and misdemeanors, such as cheating in the Tour de France, surely being interviewed by Oprah Winfrey is, well, cheating. Even Lance Armstrong admits he is unlikely to win absolution simply by subjecting himself to a trial by talk show. The road to redemption should be a grueling uphill struggle, and one undertaken without massive quantities of drugs. Many will try to climb it. Many will fall by the wayside. Here are a 10 alternative steps to salvation Armstrong may, or may not, like to consider: . 1. DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT . Before she too became an alumnus of the Oprah sofa, American sprinter Marion Jones denied doping her way to Olympic glory in the Sydney Olympics. The truth eventually overtook her. After serving jail time, Jones began a new career as a basketball player and was signed in 2010 to Tulsa Shock, a women's team whose ill-starred fortunes she failed to improve before she was let go a year later. Lance's chance: Armstrong's drive and aggression would make him a natural salesman. Perhaps used cars. Perhaps used bicycles. 2. DO SOMETHING BETTER . Blurting out anti-Semitic nonsense was a drunken Mel Gibson's ticket to purgatory in 2006. His career-topping action movie ""Apocalypto,"" released a few months later, was his ticket home. Unfortunately, Gibson kind of blew it again in 2010 when he became embroiled in allegations of domestic abuse. Despite what Jodie Foster says, he remains cast out into the wilderness. Lance's chance: Riding to a drug-free victory in the 2013 Tour de France might help. But to fully better his former glory he will need to win every Tour until 2020. 3. DO A RUNNER . Director Roman Polanski has spent 35 years on the lam from charges of unlawful sex with a minor at no apparent cost to his reputation as film maker. Polanski fled the U.S. before being sentenced in 1977, seeking refuge in France. From there he has continued a successful career that peaked in 2002 with the multi-Oscar-winning ""The Pianist."" Lance's chance: France won't take Armstrong given the damage he has done to the Tour. But as Gerard Depardieu has shown, Russia might. 4. DO A STINT IN REHAB . Charlie Sheen said rehab didn't work because he cured himself. And we believe everything he says, right? But whatever the merits of checking into a clinic are, for $4,000-a-night, your reputation gets a lot of help. Supermodel Kate Moss lost fashion contracts after she was photographed allegedly snorting drugs. After one month in rehab, the checkbooks were back out and she was flouncing down catwalks with renewed credibility. Lance's chance: What are you waiting for Armstrong? Four weeks away from the bad headlines and a chance to rule the exercise bikes in the clinic gym. 7 lessons Armstrong's confession has taught us . 5. DO A HUGH . ""I did something dishonourable, shabby and goatish,"" said movie star Hugh Grant in 1995 shortly after he was caught in a shabby, dishonorable and, if he says so, goatish liaison with a prostitute. Rather than lie or shy away from the truth, Grant simply admitted everything and apologized in the affable manner that has continued to earn him millions of Hollywood dollars. Grant could probably get away with punching President Obama by looking slightly sheepish afterwards and mumbling something in a charming English accent. Lance's chance: ""Gosh, sorry everyone, I've been a bit foolish,"" says Armstrong, pushing back his newly-cultivated floppy fringe. 6. DO A BOOK . Conveniently, Lance has already done a book. ""It's Not About the Bike,"" chronicled his victory over testicular cancer and his fight back into world class cycling. It wouldn't take much effort to tack on a couple of extra chapters and perhaps edit in a few furtive meetings with seedy doctors that he might have accidentally missed out the first time round. The book route certainly worked for drug cheat David Millar who fessed all in his 2011 autobiography ""Racing Through the Dark,"" and battled his way back last year to win a Tour de France stage to deserved acclaim. Lance's chance: Surely no one will complain if Armstrong cheats and uses a ghost writer. 7. DO A DOWNEY JR. When all else fails, do all of the above. This, so far, seems to have worked out OK for Robert Downey Jr. The once-troubled actor spent time in and out of rehab and jail. He tried something new by releasing a record. He reportedly almost wrote a book about his problems, but later pulled out of the deal. He hasn't apologized in Grantish style, but he did appear on ""Ally McBeal,"" which shows a degree of contrition. And since cleaning up his act, he's gone on to deliver some of his best work. Oh, and he's also done an Oprah interview. Lance's chance: Seven stolen Tour de France victories. Seven shots at redemption. Seems fair. 8. DO A STEP SIDEWAYS . Or, as it is also known: A Bill Clinton. It looked like the career of the 42nd president of the United States was over after details of his improper relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky hit the headlines in 1998. Miraculously, he survived impeachment and managed to ride out the rest of his term. Clinton's salvation appears to have been that the furore became less focused on what he'd done and more on what he'd said -- a complex exercise in semantics that at one point got hung up on the definition of the word ""is."" Eventually everyone got so baffled, they more or less gave up. Lance's chance: He's already started with the semantics, saying he didn't consider he was cheating at the time. 9. DO NOTHING . Can Armstrong learn anything from disgraced former U.S. congressman Anthony Weiner? Accidentally posting a photo of your own crotch on Twitter, as Weiner did, is a far cry from being accused of using performance-enhancing drugs to win major sports titles; one misdemeanor was clearly a lot bigger than the other. But size isn't everything, so perhaps Weiner, who subsequently lapsed into an 18-month silence, can offer inspiration. Apparently absolved, Weiner has now made a tentative return to Twitter and there is now talk of him running again to become New York mayor. Lance's chance:  There's never been a better reason to keep your cycling shorts firmly on. And your Twitter account off. Social media reaction to Armstrong admission . 10. DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN . OJ Simpson is never the best person to drag into an argument about redemption, but his case does offer lessons. Former footballer Simpson, as you may or may not remember, was acquitted of murdering his ex-wife and her friend in 1994. In a separate trial, which you also may or may not recall, he was held liable for their wrongful deaths and ordered to pay millions in damages. Then in 2007, as you can be forgiven for being somewhat vague about, Simpson was jailed for 33 years for armed robbery and kidnapping. The upshot of all this is not many people, clearly excluding those involved, can precisely recall what Simpson has or hasn't been found guilty of and what he is now being punished for. Not exactly redemption, but certainly a wall of confusion to hide behind. Lance's chance: On second thoughts, perhaps just stick to Oprah.

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court has just agreed to take on the case of Fisher v. University of Texas. Abigail Fisher, a white woman, argues that she has been a victim of the university's race-conscious admission policies; the university contends that its drive for racial and ethnic diversity is educationally enriching -- a benefit to all students. Will the ugly discourse that generally characterizes debate over racially preferential policies disappear with the wave of a magic Supreme Court wand? It seems unlikely. The issue is a cat with many more than nine lives. It arrived in the early 1970s and, despite many attacks, some of which have taken the form of amendments to state constitutions, it has survived in pretty fine fettle. The court will have only eight justices to hear the arguments. Elena Kagan, having been involved in the case as solicitor general in the Obama administration, has bowed out of participation. Her absence, however, leaves five justices likely to express at least some degree of skepticism about the racial preferences given to non-Asian minorities in the admissions process. Has the University of Texas been enriched by academic diversity? Maybe. But equally likely is the possibility that racial double standards reinforce stereotypes about smart whites and even smarter Asians. There are certainly wide gaps in the average SAT scores between blacks and Hispanics, on the one hand, and whites and Asians, on the other hand. Among freshmen entering the University of Texas in 2009 who did not fall into the top 10% of their high school class (automatic admission at the university), Asians scored at the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT takers nationwide, whites at the 89th percentile, Hispanics at the 80th percentile and blacks at the 52nd percentile. Startling? No. This picture has been well known for a long time. Heartbreaking, yes, because the numbers mean the underperforming minority students are being woefully ill served by the K-12 school system. Moreover, arriving at institutions of higher education with an academic disadvantage, they do not catch up, as it has become clear. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (now retired) wrote the majority opinion in a University of Michigan law school affirmative action case decided by the high court in 2003. The life of that decision is now on the line in Fisher. O'Connor should not be proud of her work in that decision. It was -- not to put too fine a point on it -- dishonest. She claimed that the law school engaged ""in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant's file."" Race was considered as simply one factor among many. Did she actually believe her own argument? The law school's own expert provided data clearly showing racial double standards in admissions -- contradicting her ""holistic"" claim. The University of Michigan's undergraduate college mechanically awarded substantial points to an applicant from an ""underrepresented"" minority group, and O'Connor pretended the law school's process was very different. In fact, as Justice David Souter pointed out, the law school simply concealed a race-driven admissions process that involved preferences actually greater than those given to undergraduate applicants. Taunting his colleagues, he called it an exercise in ""hide the ball."" O'Connor's whole decision rested on the assumption that preferences were temporary medicine for a problem already fixing itself. There was every reason to ""expect,"" she wrote, that in another quarter of a century, the pool of academically high-performing black and Hispanic applicants would have so grown as to make race-conscious admissions the strategy of a bygone era. The credulous reader might believe this confident optimism. The knowledgeable reader will know that she was either scandalously ignorant of the real record or deliberately and irresponsibly deceptive. In the dozen years preceding her opinion, the black-white gap in mean SAT scores had actually widened, and continues to do so. Hopes are running high among opponents of racial preferences that a majority of five on the court will declare affirmative action policy unconstitutional in public colleges and universities. (Private schools would not be affected by a reversal of the policy.) No fancy constitutional footwork -- just a clean execution. That will surprise me. For that to happen, five justices would have to be comfortable with the idea of screaming media headlines and much blog chatter about a court hostile to racial equality and indifferent to the gaps in opportunity that have for so long characterized American society. Will one of the men running for president raise his hand and say loudly and clearly, I oppose racial preferences in admissions to institutions of higher education?

"(CNN) -- Teenager Patrick Cantlay has brushed aside talk about turning professional after becoming the first amateur golfer to card 60 on the PGA Tour. The 19-year-old claimed the halfway lead at the Travelers Championship with his 10-under-par effort, which put him one shot clear of fellow American Johnson Wagner in Cromwell, Connecticut in the race for the $1.08 million first prize. Freshman Cantlay, who was the best-placed amateur at this month's U.S. Open as he tied for 21st, said he wanted to complete his degree at the University of California in Los Angeles before deciding whether to join the paid ranks. ""I'm not thinking about it right now. I'm going to try and take care of business this week and then see what's going on,"" the player from Long Beach, California told the PGA Tour website. Cantlay took advantage of soft greens at TPC River Highlands to beat the course record by one shot, having earlier completed a first-round 67. He is seeking to become the first amateur to win a PGA Tour event since Phil Mickelson in 1991. If successful, he will then have two months to decide whether to accept a tour place and a two-year exemption from qualifying. Cantlay, who turned 19 in March, would also be the youngest player to win on the circuit since 1900 -- shaving seven months off the effort of Johnny McDermott at the 1911 U.S. Open. ""I tried to have no expectations, just so I didn't limit myself,"" he said after becoming just the 24th player to score 60 in PGA Tour history. He shares a coach with veteran Paul Goydos, who is one of just five players to card 59 on the American tour. ""I feel bad for the kids in college,"" Goydos, who missed the cut after a second-round 68 left him tied for 110th, told the PGA website. ""He said he's going to stay four years? In four years I'll be 51. That sounds like a good deal for me. I think he should get his graduate degree."" Cantlay had set a clubhouse lead of four shots when he finished his second round on Friday, but that was trimmed to one when Wagner completed a 63 on Saturday. Fellow American Shane Bertsch matched that score to be on 10-under 130, three shots off the lead, along with Nick Watney (65). Meanwhile, English golfer Mark Foster took a two-shot lead into the final round of the European Tour's BMW Open in Germany. The 35-year-old, ranked 267th in the world, carded a six-under 66 in his third round on Saturday to be on 14-over 202 ahead of Sunday's finale in Munich. Seeking his first title in eight years, Foster will be chased by a group of five players on 204 including joint halfway leader George Coetzee of South Africa, who bogeyed his last hole for a 70. Spain's Sergio Garcia was also in that group after a nine-birdie 64, along with compatriot Pablo Larrazabal (69), England's Robert Coles (65) and South Africa's two-time major winner Retief Goosen (67). Italian teenager Matteo Manassero, the youngest player to win a European Tour event, was four shots off the pace in ninth place after a 66.","Patrick Cantlay leads Travelers Championship after breaking course record .

"CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- Azza Famy is used to breaking new ground. 18ct gold and sapphire earrings from Azza Fahmy's ""exclusive"" collection . In the 60s, she was the first woman to apprentice in Egypt's jewelry district. Today, she is heads up ""Azza Fahmy Jewelries."" A family business that has evolved into the first Egyptian designer brand and gained global recognition. Her blends of Islamic motifs, modern design and gold, silver and precious stones are worn by the likes of Naomi Campbell and Queen Rania of Jordan. In 2007, Fahmy collaborated with British fashion designer, Julien Macdonald, to provide jewelry for his catwalk collection at London Fashion Week. They worked together again in 2008. CNN's Alphonso Van Marsh (AM) sits down with Azza Fahmy (AF) and begins by asking her what makes her products so special. (AF): We take a lot of research before we do our collections. We use a lot of cultural elements and items, using the great philosopher, Saz. Great motifs. We turned a great motif to a modern motif. Each collectin takes a lot of time before you produce it. I think this makes the collection and the products very personal and very special. (AM): Tell me about your collaboration with British fashion designer Julien Macdonald. (AF): I think we met up when Julien saw our work and he liked it and came to meet me. I have something in common with Julien -- I think the flow of understanding. He showed me the collection and the colours of his work and we fantastically understand each other. (AM): Will the designs be different for clients in the West? (AF): Maybe they will not understand the verses and not understand the words. For Europe we are planning is taking motifs from various civilisations like Islamic and turning them into modern jewelry which people will understand. (AM): Why did you look towards Europe in order to build your brand? (AF): Maybe because we don't have a lot of Arab names, so all the rich people are buying foreign brands. Maybe we have to make a name and then go back. (AM): But you did go West? (AF): I do go West because I see my work is very strong and it has to be the West.

Not because I want to take it back to the Arab world but because I am proud of what I produce and I want foreign people to wear an Egyptian brand. (AM): Now you have become this global name, you have started to target Gulf arab countries. Why? (AF): As a family brand, I think we decided to expand and the nearest countries we had a good name in were in the Gulf. We have expanded in Dubai, Qatar, Bahrain and we are working in Saudi Arabia because they are the nearest markets in which we have a very good name. (AM): Is it a challeng when it can be perceived in these countries that only European names can offer high-end products? (AF): Of course, to have a product which stands beside [brands like] Cartier. it's a challenge but we are very sure of ourselves because we are presenting something special. Something which is different from these brands. (AM): Why is there a tendency for consumers to buy silver and gold, not for their design but for their weight? (AF): When you talk about the masses of people in Egypt and the Arab world, gold for them is their investment. People don't put their money in banks, they put their money in the hands of their wives and the ears of their daughters. They don't want to invest in added workmanship. It's a simple, fabricated jewelry which if he sells after five years he will more money than he paid before. (AM): Tell me about the exclusive collection . (AF): Very few pieces are produced in this line - maximum 10 to 12 pieces based on precious metals, precious stones and handmade jewelry using techniques from our masters in the workshop. We don't repeat it. We can do pieces for a client if she has a stone or would like something unique. (AM): As the industry is dominated by men, was there a glass ceiling for you? (AF): Yes, it is a very dominant business. Most of the big names in jewelry design are men and there are not a lot of women working in this business. (AM): Does it bother you when people call it designer 'bling'? (AF): It is quite a deep and nice collection not bling bling.

"(CNN) -- Legendary and now disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong told Oprah Winfrey during a confessional interview that he hopes to compete again. ""If you're asking me do I want to compete again, the answer is hell yes. I'm a competitor,"" Armstrong said during the second part of a two-part interview, which aired Friday on Winfrey's OWN channel and online. ""I can't lie to you. I'd love the opportunity to be able to compete, but that isn't the reason that I'm doing this. Frankly, this may not be the most popular answer, but I think I deserve it,"" he said. In part one of the interview, which aired Thursday, Armstrong admitted, unequivocally and for the first time, that he used performance-enhancing drugs on the way to seven Tour de France wins. When asked whether he felt disgraced, Armstrong said that he did. ""But I also feel humbled. I feel ashamed. This is ugly stuff,"" he said during the second part of the interview. Armstrong, who has been stripped of his Tour de France titles and an Olympic bronze medal, blamed no one but himself for his doping decisions, and was careful not to implicate others. 7 lessons Armstrong's confession has taught us . ""I deserve to be punished,"" Armstrong told Winfrey. But, he said: ""I'm not sure that I deserve a death penalty,"" comparing his punishment to the lesser punishments of other cyclists who doped. ""I'm not saying that that's unfair necessarily, but I'm saying it's different,"" Armstrong said. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency hit Armstrong with a lifetime ban after the agency issued a 202-page report in October that said there was overwhelming evidence he was directly involved in a sophisticated doping program. Armstrong, in the first part of the interview, talked about the culture of cycling at the time he competed, telling Winfrey that doping was widespread then and just as much ""part of the job"" as water bottles and tire pumps. The former cyclist said he didn't view using banned drugs then as cheating. ""I viewed it as a level playing field."" The scandal has tarred the Livestrong cancer charity that Armstrong founded and brought an end to his endorsement deals. He described to Winfrey stepping down from that charity, which he characterized as his ""sixth child."" That moment, he said, was his most humbling. ""To make that decision and to step aside was -- that was big,"" he said in Friday's broadcast. ""It was the best thing for the organization, but it hurt like hell."" 12 telling quotes over the years from Armstrong . Armstrong told his son: Don't defend me anymore . Throughout both parts of the interview with Winfrey, Armstrong spoke steadily and showed little emotion. That changed when Armstrong spoke about his family, and especially his kids. Appearing to hold back tears, Armstrong said he confessed to the three oldest children over the recent holiday break. ""The older kids need to not be living with this issue in their lives,"" the athlete said. ""It isn't fair."" Speaking specifically about his 13-year-old son, who he had heard defending him, Armstrong said he told the youth: ""Don't defend me anymore."" During the first part of the interview, Armstrong described himself as ""deeply flawed"" and ""arrogant,"" and spoke often of how so much was his ""fault."" 10 alternative steps to redemption for Armstrong . ""I was a bully,"" he told Winfrey of how he treated others who might expose him. But Armstrong was not telling the whole story, author David Coyle, who wrote a book about doping and the Tour de France, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday night. ""A partial confession is sort of the pattern here,"" he said. ""Maybe this is Armstrong's partial, and more will come out later."" The cyclist denied pushing teammates to dope, an assertion Coyle countered. ""Tyler Hamilton gets a phone call: Be on a plane tomorrow. We're flying to Valencia to do a blood transfusion. That's what happens,"" Coyle said. Armstrong described his years of denial as ""one big lie that I repeated a lot of times."" He had races to win and a fairy tale image to keep up. He reminisced on his storied past of being a hero who overcame cancer, winning the Tour repeatedly, having a happy marriage, children. ""It's just this mythic, perfect story, and it isn't true,"" he said. Bleacher Report: Twitter erupts Thursday night . Former teammate: More needs to happen . Former cyclist Tyler Hamilton, who raced as a teammate of Armstrong from 1998 to 2001, said it was nice to hear Armstrong own up to some of his faults. Hamilton was among those who broke from Armstrong and decried his use of performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong at the time denied the allegations and threatened him with legal action. ""He's made the first step,"" Hamilton told CNN's Piers Morgan before the second interview aired. ""There are many more steps to come for Lance Armstrong."" According to Hamilton, the next step for the disgraced cyclist is to testify before cycling officials about the doping network, naming names as needed. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which tests Olympic athletes for performance-enhancing drugs, similarly described the interview as a ""small step in the right direction."" Who is the next cycling hero? ""If he is sincere in his desire to correct his past mistakes, he will testify under oath about the full extent of his doping activities,"" USADA CEO Travis Tygart said. The International Cycling Union called it ""disturbing"" to see Armstrong's confessions, but it said the sport is much different today than it was 10 years ago. ""Lance Armstrong's decision finally to confront his past is an important step forward on the long road to repairing the damage that has been caused to cycling and to restoring confidence in the sport,"" union president Pat McQuaid said. Livestrong to likely survive Armstrong doping admission . Years of success and defiance, then a rapid fall . After winning various legs of the Tour de France, Armstrong's sporting career ground to a halt in 1996, when he was diagnosed with cancer. He was 25. Why we cheat . He told Winfrey that he then developed a ""ruthless and relentless"" attitude that helped him survive. But he carried it with him into his sports career, ""and that's bad,"" he said. He returned to the cycling world, however. His breakthrough came in 1999, and he didn't stop as he reeled off seven straight wins in his sport's most prestigious race. Allegations of doping began during this time, as did Armstrong's vehement defiance. He left the sport after his last win, in 2005, only to return to the tour in 2009. Armstrong still insists he was clean when he finished third that year, but that comeback led to his downfall. ""We wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't come back,"" he told Winfrey. In 2011, Armstrong retired once more from cycling. But his fight to maintain his clean reputation continued. Federal prosecutors launched a criminal investigation, but it was dropped in February. Cancer survivors have mixed feelings on Armstrong . In April, the USADA notified Armstrong of an investigation into new doping charges. In response, the cyclist accused the organization of trying to ""dredge up discredited"" allegations and filed a lawsuit in federal court trying to halt the case. Those who suffered for speaking out now feel vindicated. They include Betsy Andreu, wife of fellow cyclist Frankie Andreu, who said she overheard Armstrong acknowledge to a doctor treating him for cancer in 1996 that he had used performance-enhancing drugs. ""This was a guy who used to be my friend, who decimated me,"" Andreu told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday night. ""He could have come clean. He owed it to me. He owes it to the sport that he destroyed."" The former athletic icon conceded he'd let down many fans ""who believed in me and supported me."" ""I will spend the rest of my life ... trying to earn back trust and apologize to people."" Opinion: A loss for Lance, a win for Oprah .

"(CNN) -- We love the glamor of alpine skiing, the glow of tradition, the glitz of stars like Lindsey Vonn, and the gumption of her quest to race the men. But do we love it enough to keep watching when skiing's ""dark side"" is so much more exciting and dangerous? Freestyle skiing is taking over the Olympics. A global passion for taking two skis to new extremes is reaching its zenith, and the Olympic movement has responded by adding a succession of new events to its program. When slopestyle and ski halfpipe make their debut at the Sochi 2014 Winter Games, freestyle skiers will for the first time have as many medals to aim at as their alpine counterparts. And as fans are increasingly drawn to new, high-octane breeds of winter sport, so top athletes are making the switch too. In 2009, Kelsey Serwa left behind alpine racing for ski cross. Within two years she had become an X Games gold medalist and world champion. ""Ski cross is full of outcasts from alpine,"" the Canadian 23-year-old tells CNN. ""Alpine is so strict on rules. Ski cross is more relaxed, for free spirits or people looking for something more exciting than racing the clock."" Ski cross, a thrilling four-way straight fight to the finish line, blew the socks off TV audiences on its debut at Vancouver 2010, where Serwa finished fifth overall. For some, it made the blue riband downhill races look almost pedestrian. Serwa calls it the ""dark side"" of ski racing. ""It's so simple,"" she says. ""You don't have to know anything about it, it's obvious: Whoever is leading is the best, right? And if they make a mistake and get passed, you see why. You don't have to understand, just watch and enjoy."" Contrast that with alpine, where even experts can struggle to identify exactly how and why a race was won -- including Serwa. ""I've raced alpine but even I didn't understand everything,"" she admits. ""Is that guy faster than the fastest split time? Or faster than the fastest racer in general? It's kind of like, 'I don't know what's going on.' "" As president of the International Skiing History Association, John Fry has been watching alpine skiing for more than half a century. In that time, he hasn't solved this problem. ""It's very difficult, even for a highly trained eye, to see how a race was won. Sometimes you have five or six racers who finish within one second of each other. It's a built-in problem,"" says Fry, who helped to found alpine's World Cup circuit in the 1960s as the editor of Ski magazine. Yet having witnessed the birth of freestyle skiing in the 1970s and its subsequent explosion, he believes freestyle could end up eating itself. Is the proliferation of events making freestyle as hard to grasp for the novice as the intricacies of downhill? ""To me, there are too many Olympic events,"" he says. ""They keep inventing more and more, and they're all relatively minor. In your great classic sports such as golf and tennis, which I think are comparable to skiing, you have all this history. ""Commentators and writers can refer to golf's Masters champions, how Jack Nicklaus did, how Bobby Jones played, and how that compares to today. There's great history there. ""All these novelties, these new events, have very little history to them."" But Fry also thinks alpine skiing is missing vital chances to broaden its appeal in an era where younger generations, their attention spans waning by the second, are overwhelmed by choice. ""A couple of years ago, when (alpine superstars) Lindsey Vonn and Maria Riesch were virtually tied for the season title, they refused to have a race-off which would have attracted a huge television audience,"" he said. ""They didn't let it happen 'because of a rule.' It's the same thing now that Vonn wants to race the men. They say: 'No, there's a rule, women can't race.' ""Can you imagine the international TV audience they would attract with that race? These opportunities are presented on a platter, but they don't seem to happen."" For freestyle skiing's fans, TV is largely irrelevant. Their home is the web, where anyone with the right moves and a camera can find a huge audience. Meet the Hannula brothers -- Ilkka and Verneri, both 19 -- their friend Juho Kilkki, 20, and cameraman Janne Korpela, 18. They call themselves Real Skifi. They live in the town of Jyvaskyla, in central Finland, and the internet loves them. ""Our latest episode has been viewed over half a million times,"" Korpela tells CNN. ""I didn't dare to dream we would get this popular."" The quartet spend their days and Jyvaskyla's long, dark midwinter nights finding rails, walls and other beguiling items of street furniture in their hometown. What they find, they ski on. Or over, or under, or through. They call it ""urban skiing."" ""We try to choose our spots so we aren't too close to people's homes,"" says Korpela. ""The one time the police kicked us out was when we were filming about 200 meters from the local hospital, in between two roads."" Dozens of dangerous takes might be needed to get each trick right, but it pays off: short compilations are uploaded to Vimeo and each one becomes a hit with thousands of Facebook fans. There have, as yet, been no serious injuries. Disciplines like slopestyle incorporate a lot of the same moves you will see Real Skifi pulling off in their videos. As a sport, freestyle speaks to them far more than watching one skier after another race the clock down the same old slope -- Vonn or no Vonn. ""It would be boring to just ski down the slope,"" says Verneri Hannula. ""That's why we like to do tricks. When we do tricks, the only limit is our imagination. But when we do alpine skiing, the limit is the 100m-high slope we have."" Kilkki adds: ""The only skiing you see on television is pretty much alpine stuff, and that's boring to my eyes. ""Freeskiing is a wildly rising sport. Our local ski hill is full of young kids on their new twin tips (double-ended freestyle skis). That's one reason our videos have become popular. Freeskiing is a lot different from alpine, the videos are a much bigger part of the sport."" Freestyle skiing now enticingly combines a young, passionate fanbase, avidly consuming the sport through the web, with a raft of Olympic disciplines which are guaranteed mainstream airtime next year. But if alpine racing's position on top of the pile is ever to be truly threatened, freestyle needs to match alpine's impressive presence on worldwide TV, which remains the kingmaker of sports even this far into the 21st Century. For example, Olympic downhill champion Vonn (televised) has more than 150,000 Twitter followers; ski cross world champion Serwa (streamed) has 650. That makes Sochi 2014 an unparalleled opportunity which freestyle athletes know they must take. ""Alpine will always be strong, it has its roots set pretty deep,"" admits Serwa. ""But we're going to get more followers from a younger crowd. We race at the X Games and that crowd, those kinds of kids will be watching it when they grow up. ""Right now we're battling most with exposure. I believe we have only three or four races broadcast in Canada this year, and last year we had none, not even a race that was held in Canada. For us to get big, we need that TV time. ""Once people see freestyle skiing, they'll really get into it. We won't have to do anything different from what we're doing right now to get people to follow it.""","A pair of freestyle skiing events to be introduced at 2014 Winter Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Persuading Congress to ban assault weapons will be tough, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Thursday. But it's a fight the outspoken advocate of stricter gun laws says he's determined to win. ""Getting rid of assault weapons, that is a tougher sell, and that's what we've really got to work on,"" Bloomberg said in an interview with CNN's AC360Â°. ""I'm optimistic, but it's tougher."" Bloomberg said he's encouraging the roughly 800 mayors who are members of his Mayors Against Illegal Guns organization to start lobbying lawmakers and ""explain to them why constituents really want this done."" Speaking a day after President Barack Obama announced a list of proposals to reduce gun violence, Bloomberg said the package -- which calls on Congress to reinstate the assault weapons ban, restrict ammunition magazines and expand background checks for gun buyers -- is ""reasonably comprehensive."" And even though parts of the proposal will face an uphill battle, he said, that doesn't mean it isn't a worthwhile fight. Obama-backed gun bills considered a longshot in Congress . ""There are lives involved here. And if you can save one life, isn't that worth trying?"" Bloomberg said. ""And I always thought that you should address issues when they're on the public's conscience, while they're being covered by the press, and you should try to do a complete job so you don't have to go back again and again and again."" Poll: Gun control support wanes . Republicans immediately rejected the Obama proposals as an attack on the constitutional right to bear arms. ""Nothing the president is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said in a statement. ""That's probably true,"" Bloomberg acknowledged on Thursday. ""But that doesn't mean that having fewer guns around isn't a better idea."" Under New York's stricter gun laws, he said, the city has seen murder and suicide rates that are lower than the national average. Last week, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told AC360Â° that the evidence in Chicago tells a different story. A look at U.S. gun laws . ""Chicago has very strict gun laws. It is also the deadliest city in America,"" Gingrich said. Asked Thursday about Gingrich's observation, Bloomberg said gun laws aren't a panacea. ""There's no one solution to this,"" he said. ""This is, however, a very important step. Fewer guns means fewer murders. Fewer guns means fewer suicides. Fewer guns means you and your children are safer."" Since last month's shooting massacre at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, Bloomberg and his group have been at the forefront of a push for stricter gun laws. Opinion: A father's murder, a plea on gun control . He's said that more than 1 million people have signed a petition backed by the organization to tighten gun control laws in the wake of the Newtown shooting rampage. The group has spent millions on television spots calling for gun control, including an ad that ran nationally this week, featuring family members of victims killed by gun violence repeating the word, ""enough."" On Thursday, Bloomberg sharply criticized the National Rifle Association for its approach to the gun control debate. After blaming video games for the Newtown shooting rampage, the organization released its own gun-related mobile video game. And on Tuesday night, the NRA released an ad accusing Obama of hypocrisy for being ""skeptical"" about placing armed guards at schools, when his two daughters are protected by the U.S. Secret Service. That was ""bad P.R."" and an ""outrage,"" Bloomberg said. ""I think it's just a bad strategy,"" he said, ""and they're going to lose this battle.""

"(CNN) -- It might seem a bit strange that actress Jodie Foster chose an event watched by millions to make the case for the need for privacy. Well, this is Hollywood, after all. The celebrated actress took the occasion of receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award at Sunday's Golden Globes ceremony to make several personal statements -- including a few that weren't exactly clear. But one thing Foster was definitive about was how much she values her privacy. In a speech that many found to be touching and which appeared to address gossip about her sexual orientation, the 50-year-old Foster reflected on being in show business since she was 3 years old. ""If you had been a public figure from the time that you were a toddler, if you'd had to fight for a life that felt real and honest and normal against all odds, then maybe you, too, might value privacy above all else,"" she said, to cheers from the Golden Globes crowd. 5 memorable moments from the Globes . But how realistic is the expectation of privacy in an age where many celebrities depend on their social media connection to fans more than they do traditional marketing machines and every moment of their lives is reported in the media? Long gone are the days when a studio would work with journalists to bury negative press about stars or protect their personal lives, said Robert J. Thompson, founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. ""Everybody who is carrying around a cell phone has the ability to take a picture of you behaving badly, getting in trouble,"" Thompson said. ""People have been hounding celebrities for as long as their have been celebrities, but now there are just so many more venues to where the results of that hounding can go."" And in some cases the celebrities are feeding into those venues. Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts are almost mandatory for the 21st-century star who can choose to reveal themselves to millions of fans without having to hold a press conference or even leaving their homes. Take Rihanna and Chris Brown, whose reignited connection has been thoroughly documented by the pair via their social media accounts -- and just as thoroughly criticized by music fans and the news media. Yet these same celebrities will sometimes insist that they hope the media will ""respect their privacy."" While a writer for Newsweek, journalist Steve Tuttle tackled the issue in a piece titled ""Pay Attention and Leave Me Alone"" in which he noted that ""How I Met Your Mother"" star Neil Patrick Harris announced on Twitter that he and his partner David were expecting twins while ""Hoping the press can respect our privacy."" ""Seriously? Why did you tweet this personal information if you wanted privacy?"" Tuttle wrote. ""I think Harris is an extremely gifted and funny guy, but this is yet another in a long line of celebrities asking us to respect their privacy while at the same time broadcasting news about their family or career -- and I'm only talking about the last week or so."" Not that Foster has ever been the type to share even the most benign parts of her personal life, yet alone on social media. Which may be why some viewers waited with bated breath when she announced at the Globes that she had ""a sudden urge to say something that I've never really been able to air in public."" ""I am single,"" Foster said after a bit of a buildup. The audience laughed. ""Seriously, I hope that you're not disappointed that there won't be a big coming-out speech tonight because I already did my coming out about a thousand years ago back in the Stone Age, very quaint days when a fragile young girl would open up to trusted friends and family, co-workers and then gradually, proudly to everyone who knew her, to everyone she actually met,"" she continued. ""But now apparently, I'm told that every celebrity is expected to honor the details of their private life with a press conference, a fragrance, and a prime-time reality show,"" Foster said. ""And you guys might be surprised, but I am not Honey Boo Boo Child. No. I'm sorry. That's just not me."" While many cheered Foster's remarks, some were less than enthused. Wall Street Journal writer Eric Sasson wrote, ""It seems a bit less than gracious, and something of a stretch, for Foster to conflate the public's desire to know about her orientation with a fragrance-toting, prime-time-reality-show mugging celebrity culture."" ""Was Martina Navratilova acting like Honey Boo Boo Child when she came out,"" Sasson said. ""How about Barney Frank, or Elton John, or Ellen? Foster seems to be suggesting that it's the absurd degree to which the media and the world no longer value privacy that has forced her to hold on to her own so tightly. But Jodie Foster is 50 years old, and Honey Boo Boo Child hasn't been around for more than a year."" Fellow former child actor Seth Green discussed the issue of privacy in a recent ""WTF with Marc Maron"" podcast and said he traces the interest to the rise in the tabloid culture over the past few years that has people enthralled with the lives of celebrities. Cristiano Ronaldo and Daniel Craig: A right to privacy? ""All of a sudden (celebs) are being put out as the most important kings and queens of our community,"" Green said. In general, Green said, the public ""are becoming increasingly fascinated with pop culture and shiny things and squashed and stretched animated versions of our superheroes. We are becoming less and less concerned about privacy, security."" Syracuse professor Thompson said that with the 24-hour news cycle and so many publications trying to outdo each other in terms of exclusives, celebrity ""images and barging in on their privacy is a cottage industry for a lot of people."" Should celebrities feel entitled to privacy? ""Maybe,"" he said. ""But should you expect that you are going to get it?"" ""Probably not.""","Actress Jodie Foster discussed privacy during her speech at the Golden Globes .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will join what is perhaps America's most exclusive club, peppered with names such as Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt, when he delivers his second inaugural address on Monday. By the numbers: Presidential inaugurations . Sixteen of his 43 predecessors, including five of the nation's first seven presidents, gave more than one inauguration speech, topped by the unprecedented four by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. While inaugurations celebrate American democracy through the peaceful transition or extension of power at a ceremony full of pageantry and color, a second inaugural address tends to feel like many second weddings -- important, for sure, but lacking some of the nervous anticipation of the first one. That could be especially true for Obama, whose historic ascendancy to the White House four years ago as the nation's first African-American president defined a new political era. ""On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord,"" he told a frigid crowd estimated at a record 1.8 million people that stretched the length of the National Mall on January 20, 2009. Much of Washington rejoiced that day and night, with 10 official inaugural balls and scores of unofficial ones epitomizing the grandeur of the moment. The great reset: Will Obama's second inauguration let America turn the page? Now Obama is a weathered incumbent. His hair is graying at age 51 from a first term of tribulations, including an inherited recession, the end of one war and the winding down of another, and constant political brinksmanship with Congress over budgets and spending. His declaration at his first inauguration of an end to ""the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics"" proved unfounded. GOP opponents threaten default and government shutdown over upcoming debt ceiling and funding deadlines. Obama also faces a political showdown over his gun control proposals -- one of Washington's most intractable issues -- in the wake of last month's school massacre that killed 20 first-graders in Newtown, Connecticut. House GOP discussing short-term increase in debt ceiling . Obama-backed gun bills considered a long shot in Congress . Whether he will explicitly cite such challenges in his second inaugural address was unclear. Asked about Obama's preparations, White House spokesman Jay Carney on Thursday would only offer that the president was ""very appreciative of the fact that the American people have given him this opportunity to deliver a second inaugural address."" ""He takes very seriously speeches of this kind, and he's very engaged in the process,"" Carney added, noting that Obama wrote initial drafts of speeches in longhand on yellow pads. ""I've seen some yellow pads of late with writing."" History provides little guidance on what to expect Monday. While themes of unifying the country and seeking God's blessings are common to most inaugural addresses, second efforts have come in varied lengths and styles. Ulysses S. Grant concluded his second inaugural address with a claim of vindication. He noted that his role as Union military leader and president subjected him to ""abuse and slander scarcely ever equaled in political history, which today I feel that I can afford to disregard in view of your verdict"" of re-election. Some two-term presidents focused their second speeches on particular challenges at hand, such as Abraham Lincoln's highly regarded address in the final days of the Civil War in 1865, shortly before his assassination. Ryan to attend Obama's inauguration . ""With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations,"" Lincoln said to conclude the speech of 697 words, a fraction of the 3,610 in his first inaugural address. He had acknowledged that difference to begin his remarks, saying: ""At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first."" Share your inauguration photos on iReport . In a passage that would seem to fit Obama also, Lincoln noted that ""at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented."" Three score and 12 years earlier, George Washington set the standard for a shortened second inaugural speech. He limited it to 135 words, compared with the 1,428 he spoke when he became the nation's first president. Roosevelt's fourth and final inaugural address, in 1945, also was his shortest, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin told CNN. Dual inauguration ceremonies honor tradition and law . ""It was a five-minute speech, and he needed to fortify himself with whiskey in order to get through the pain that he was feeling"" from the heart failure that would kill him months later, she said, noting Roosevelt also canceled the traditional inaugural parade that year. ""In the middle of a war, why are we going to have a parade, who's going to parade?"" she said Roosevelt had asked. ""Normally you have military people parading, and they were in the war itself."" More recently, the trend has been to talk longer the second time around, as demonstrated by both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. While only Obama knows if he will scale back his speech from the 2,395 words of four years ago, other inaugural staples are being reduced this time. There will be two official inaugural balls, eight fewer than in 2009. Because January 20 -- Inauguration Day -- falls on a Sunday this year, the official swearing-in will occur at the White House, attended by the president's family. Monday will be the public ceremony, with Obama to be sworn in again by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts at the U.S. Capitol, followed by the president's speech and then the parade up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House.

"New York (CNN) -- Things a 7-year-old boy expects Mom to put in his backpack: A peanut butter sandwich. Pencils. Maybe even a nice note with a little heart scrawled on it. Things he doesn't: a flare gun, a .22-caliber pistol, a loaded magazine and, for good measure, 14 more bullets in a plastic bag. But that's exactly what a second-grader had inside his Batman backpack Thursday morning when he arrived at Wave Preparatory Elementary School in Far Rockaway in Queens, Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said Friday. 3 injured after shotgun accidentally fires at N.C. gun show . The mom, Deborah Farley, 53, told police she had been, according to Browne, ""out walking the streets of Queens late Wednesday night"" with the guns in her son's backpack and she forgot to take them out. She rushed back to school after dropping him off Thursday and asked the boy what he'd done with the gun, Browne said. When the boy told her he'd handed it over to a classmate, she finally came clean to administrators, who put the school on lockdown and called police. As it turns out, the boy had given away the flare gun, but police found the pistol, the loaded magazine and the bag of bullets still in his bag, according to Browne. Nobody was hurt, but police arrested Farley on Friday on charges of endangering the welfare of a child and criminal possession of a firearm. The pistol was unlicensed, Browne said. A search of the woman's home found more ammunition and seven plastic bags of marijuana, Browne said. Child protective workers took the boy and his 9-year-old brother into custody, he said.

"(CNN) -- The people have spoken and President Barack Obama has another four years in office. When it comes to the economy we know what the president wants to do in his second term. Obama's measures are incremental and nuanced, with the exception of the most talked about, which is raising taxes on higher income earners. This will be done by not renewing the Bush-era tax cuts for those at the top, and by a so-called Buffet-rule, an overarching principle that would set a minimum rate of tax payable by those earning more than a million dollars a year, and prevent them from going below that using deductions. The tax cuts for the middle class under the Bush-era would be made permanent. Thereafter it is a real hodge podge of tax incentives, advantages, allowances and policies designed to stimulate business and bring jobs back to America. None of them are eye catching. It is hard to get excited about the Manufacturing Communities Tax Credit or the American Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit, however important they may be. Obama has also talked of taking a more muscular approach to China when it comes to trade. Having been goaded by Mitt Romney on the campaign trail, the U.S. has indicated that the next four years will have to see China playing on a level playing field. Unfortunately saying and doing are two different things. The president spent much of his first term just putting out the fires. As The Economist put it in its endorsement, he ""dragged America's economy back from the brink of disaster."" It could have been a great deal worse. But his supporters say he hasn't had a true chance to effect real change and that will be up for grabs. If, as seems possible, the U.S. economy does continue to grow at around 2% to 3% over the next few years -- not fast enough for a massive reduction in unemployment or new spending -- he might be able to at least advance his non-crisis management policies. But hang on. I am getting ahead of myself. Before any of this comes to fruition the single most important task the president faces: Stopping the country going over the fiscal cliff. The cliff comes about because of a rare confluence of events. The expiration of tax cuts, the implementation of mandatory spending cuts, the limitation of certain benefits and so on. If it all happened at once, come January next year, it's estimated it could take a toll of 4% of U.S. GDP. This would comfortably push the economy into recession. Congress and the president have to find a way to pull back from the cliff. And that will be job number one over the next few months of the lame duck congress and into the new year. Even the threat of the cliff is having a depressing effect on business decisions. If they dilly and dally about sorting it out then the damage that could be caused between now and inauguration could easily outdo any benefit the president may make in the early years of his second term. There is one other economic issue where the president can't do very much. And that is the European sovereign debt crisis. Bully. Cajole. Berate. Treasury secretary Tim Geithner has tried them all. Fundamentally the U.S. has to sit on the sidelines, watch, wait and pray the Europeans get their act together. It looks like there will also have to be a new economic team. It is widely expected (although not confirmed) that Geithner won't stay much longer at Treasury. He has done four years and it's believed he wants to move back to New York. If he goes then one of the most important joists in the Obama economic team has gone. The chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke -- who has just launched QE3 -- will be there longer. His term doesn't expire until 2014, about a year into Obama's second term. (It's an ultimate irony that Bernanke will be gone -- if not reappointed -- before the 2015 date that the Federal Open Market Committee currently has as its target for keeping interest rates at exceptionally low levels). What we have seen over the past 12 months in the U.S. economy is likely to be the story of the next 12 months. Incremental, slow improvements as both consumers continue to pay down debt, and repair their household finances. The posh word for this is deleveraging. Business may have lots of cash but with so much uncertainty and worry they are not about to spend it. Hoarding money will continue until there is tangible solid evidence that growth is sustainable (we are seeing some signs -- consumer confidence, house prices, housing starts, durable numbers etc -- but it is still tentative). The banks have slowly rebuilt their capital base and if the economy continues this gradual progression then we can expect lending to begin....but again....it's expected to be slow. In that case, unemployment will continue its very gradual decrease. With economic growth around 2% to 3% for the next few years, jobs will be created at a much slower rate than needed to make a serious dent in the overall level of joblessness. Even the Fed doesn't see things getting much better anytime soon on the jobs front. I have said it before. Today's economies (especially the U.S.) are like a patient who has suffered cancer, leukemia and a brain tumor all at the same time. Surgery has removed much of the damage. Chemotherapy continues to be administered. The patient is going to take time to recover. For Obama, the goal will be to have policies that move from triage to rehabilitation and finally to better times. Perhaps the big unknown for this president is exactly how he will start the long, painful and politically devastating business of cutting the deficit. Having had pretty much universal agreement from the IMF, World Bank, OECD and others that now was not the time for retrenchment, we are coming to that time when addressing the U.S. budget deficit will be a priority. The second term starts that process. Unfortunately, as we saw during the budget summit last year, that may be almost impossible. There's also the matter of seeing the exact nature of the Congress too. The U.S. lost its coveted AAA rating under Obama. This was the unthinkable, and it happened. In term two he would be wise to get ahead of this deficit curve. We know what the president says he wants to do. We know the policies he hopes to introduce. Now he just has to do it.","Obama plans to introduce tax hikes on highest earners and keep middle class tax cuts .

"New York (CNN) -- This could have caused a major blast from the past. Workers cleaning a cannon last fired more than 200 years ago were shocked to find that it was still loaded with gunpowder and a cannonball. The preservation workers from New York's Central Park Conservancy were removing rust from the antique cannon, which once fired munitions aboard the British warship H.M.S Hussar, when they made the explosive discovery, New York police Detective Brian Sessa said. Workers immediately called 911, and NYPD's emergency services unit and bomb squad responded, Sessa said. Technicians determined that the gunpowder was still active. Authorities removed about 1.8 pounds of black gunpowder from the scene and took it to a gun range for disposal, the detective said. The loaded artillery piece was one of two Revolutionary War-era cannons being stored at the park's Ramble shed, near the 79th Street transverse, according to CNN affiliate WCBS. ""This was an amazing surprise,"" John Moore, author of the upcoming book ""The Secrets of Central Park,"" told WCBS. ""It was there for so many years, and people were sitting on it when it was a loaded cannon.""","The cannon fired munitions aboard the British warship H.M.S Hussar .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) --  -- It's OK for Republicans to want President Obama to fail if they think he's jeopardizing the country, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal told members of his political party Tuesday night. Gov. Bobby Jindal is offering a spirited defense of Republicans who say they want President Obama to fail. Jindal described the premise of the question -- ""Do you want the president to fail?"" -- as the ""latest gotcha game"" being perpetrated by Democrats against Republicans. ""Make no mistake: Anything other than an immediate and compliant, 'Why no sir, I don't want the president to fail,' is treated as some sort of act of treason, civil disobedience or political obstructionism,"" Jindal said at a political fundraiser attended by 1,200 people. ""This is political correctness run amok."" Since conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh said that he hoped that Obama would fail, Republicans have been pressed by Democrats and the media about Limbaugh's comments. Jindal, a potential 2012 presidential candidate, told the Republican audience he would ""not be brow beaten on this, and I will not kowtow to their correctness."" ""My answer to the question is very simple: 'Do you want the president to fail?' It depends on what he is trying to do."" Jindal, who served two terms in the U.S. House, returned to Washington to help his former colleagues raise more than $6 million for the 2010 midterm elections. And he likely picked up important political chits, should he decide to run for president. So far, Jindal has sidestepped questions about 2012. But on Tuesday he seemed to be laying the groundwork in case he eventually decides the political climate is right. A video of favorable back-to-back TV reports about Jindal preceded his introduction to the audience. And Jindal used his remarks to deep-pocketed Republican donors to emphasize his vision for how the Grand Old Party can get back on track. He made a point to criticize Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for a ""spending spree"" that he said ""is costing the taxpayers more than the Iraq war, more than the Vietnam War, and, near and dear to my heart, even more than the Louisiana Purchase."" Jindal singled out House Republicans for standing up to Obama and helping the GOP return to its conservative roots. The governor took a controversial stand when he refused to accept $98 million in federal stimulus money to expand unemployment benefits in Louisiana, because he said it would force an unfair tax on businesses when the funding ran out. Democrats and other critics blasted Jindal's decision, saying he was influenced by presidential ambitions. But many conservatives saw his decision as a principled stand. Moments after Jindal wrapped up his remarks Tuesday, Obama held his second prime-time news conference 12 blocks away at the White House. Last month, Jindal delivered the Republican response following Obama's joint address to Congress. The governor was widely panned for his performance, which he addressed Tuesday at the top of his speech. ""Many of you have asked that I reprise my State of the Union response speech,"" Jindal said. ""That was a joke by the way. It's OK to laugh about it. ""I have just learned that because of President Obama's opposition to torture, it is now illegal to show my speech to prisoners at Gitmo,"" he added. The governor's speech then took on a serious tone when he emphasized the need for Republicans to put the 2008 election behind them and embrace the role of loyal opposition party. ""It's time to declare our time of introspection and navel-gazing officially over,"" Jindal said. ""It's time to get on with the business of charting America's future. So, as of now, be it hereby resolved that we will focus on America's future, and on standing up for fiscal sanity, before it is too late."" With the next presidential election three years away and the fact that he has to face Louisiana voters in 2011 if he seeks re-election, it is not surprising that Jindal does not publicly express interest in running in 2012. But if the governor is considering a presidential bid, he must now focus on learning to become a national candidate and building a political operation. Unlike potential 2012 rivals such as Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee, Jindal doesn't have a national infrastructure in place, nor the experience the two men gained crisscrossing the country in their failed 2008 bids for the White House. And Jindal lacks the name recognition of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential nominee who is said to be considering her own campaign in 2012. GOP operative Alex Vogel said it is critical for Jindal or any other Republican candidate to begin amassing a list of national supporters similar to what Obama created for the 2008 campaign. ""It is all about data,"" said Vogel, a former senior aide to the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and ex-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. ""The best candidate in the world is only as good as his database. How many cell phone numbers, e-mails and mailing addresses can you collect? You can't collect that in a presidential campaign. You have to do that now."" Vogel also said that beyond ""fine-tuning his message,"" Jindal needs to continue giving speeches, attending political events and appearing on television if he wants to get used to running for national office. At 37, Jindal potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. ""There is plenty of time between now and the primaries for him to tighten his game,"" said Jonathan Grella, a GOP strategist who has worked for former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ""He obviously has got a long ways to go before he performs at a presidential level, and particularly at the Obama level. That is a tall order. But Bobby Jindal is an above-average political performer now, and he has plenty of room to grow.""","Jindal: If Obama's policies jeopardize U.S., nothing wrong in desiring his failure .

"(CNN) -- Baseball Hall of Fame manager Earl Sidney Weaver, who led the Baltimore Orioles to four pennants and a World Series title with a pugnacity toward umpires, died Saturday of an apparent heart attack at age 82, Major League Baseball said. Dubbed ""the Earl of Baltimore,"" Weaver managed the American League team for 17 seasons and amassed a record of 1,480 wins and 1,060 losses, including five 100-win seasons (1969-1971 and 1979-1980). He and the team won the World Series in 1970. The tenacious Weaver was outspoken with some players as well as umpires. At the same time, he was open to innovation, using computers to analyze opposing pitchers and pioneering the introduction of radar guns to measure fastballs and other pitches. On the matter of marching out of the dugout to give the umps a piece of his mind, Weaver said: ""The job of arguing with the umpire belongs to the manager, because it won't hurt the team if he gets thrown out of the game."" Stan Musial dead at 92 . Team managing partner Peter Angelos described Weaver as standing ""alone as the greatest manager in the history of the Orioles organization and one of the greatest in the history of baseball."" ""This is a sad day for everyone who knew him and for all Orioles fans. Earl made his passion for the Orioles known both on and off the field,"" Angelos said in a statement. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said Weaver was ""a beloved Baltimore legend."" ""Many will remember Earl for ushering in a new era of success for the Baltimore Orioles,"" O'Malley said. ""He led the O's to four World Series -- including the memorable World Championship victory of 1970."" Elected to the Hall of Fame in 1996, Weaver joked in his induction speech about his feuds with star pitcher Jim Palmer -- also in the Hall of Fame -- by saying he was the player ""I had more arguments with than my wife."" Weaver managed the team from 1968 to 1982 and 1985 to 1986. He was regarded as among the most ejected managers in baseball -- more than 90 times. He thanked umpires in his induction speech, saying the game can't be played without them. ""I'm serious when I say their integrity and honesty is, and must be, beyond reproach,"" Weaver said. ""Now counting balls and strikes and close plays on the bases, they must have made over a million calls while I was managing, and except for those 91 or 92 times I disagreed, they got the other ones right.""
