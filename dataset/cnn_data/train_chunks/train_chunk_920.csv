"By . Mark Prigg . A new app claims to be able to change the way we read - and instantly turn anyone into a speed reader. It works by quickly flashing words onto the same part of a screen so the eyes do not need to refocus. Its Us inventors claim anyone can reach speeds of 1000 words per minute using the app, and hopes to bring it to websites, phones and even watches. Click below to see the app in action . Spritz's technology streams individual words inside of a special display called the ""Redicle,"" which helps the eyes to position themselves precisely at the recognition point for each word. The most time-consuming part of reading is the eye movement from word to word, the firm says. By applying their new method of word alignment that's based on the science of how people traditionally recognize words while reading, Spritz takes eye movement out of the equation, allowing much more to be read in the same amount of time. Spritz has also developed proprietary algorithms to identify how long to display words and sentences. Spritz's technology enhances reading on mobile and wearable devices by streaming individual words using the 'Optimal Recognition Point' (ORP) in a special display called the 'Redicle.' This method makes communication faster, easier and more effective by removing the inefficient eye movements associated with traditional reading. Developed and tested for over three years it enables the brain to focus on each word, promoting faster reading speeds and higher information retention rates. Spritz is uniquely designed for small screens,' the firm says. 'The technology removes the inconvenience of scrolling, swiping, squinting and pinching to read on your devices by streaming individual words, one by one, at the user's desired speed.' The first use of Spritz will be implemented in an email application for the Samsung Gear 2 and Galaxy S5 smartphone. Spritz is working with Samsung to develop the system for the firm's Gear 2 smartwatch, shown here running the software. 'We're reinventing the way people read by eliminating the obstacles associated with traditional reading on mobile devices,' said Co-Founder and CEO Frank Waldman. 'As smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller, Spritz enables users to read comfortably and conveniently. 'Our technology can be used to read emails, text messages, social media streams, maps or web content and can be integrated onto any mobile device – the options are almost limitless. 'Reading has never been easier, more efficient or more effective.' For the past two years, Spritz has focused on development and testing of its technology for integration into mobile OS platforms, applications and webpages. When you read normally, your brain is not only busy processing the words inside of your main vision, but also scans ahead for an indication of what is coming up.  Since your eyes do not need to move while spritzing, your brain quickly becomes comfortable with not needing the additional information. Through testing users, it was found that new users were able to both learn how to spritz and to double their traditional reading speed within just a few minutes of starting. In addition, it was determined that reading with Spritz also promotes increased comprehension of the material vs. traditional reading. 'When we started testing, we already knew that we were on to something but the comprehension tests surprised even us,' said Dr. Maik Maurer, Co-Founder and CTO of Spritz. 'Happily, our tests confirmed that spritzing increases comprehension. 'We're now starting to research whether time spent spritzing will also increase a user's traditional reading speed and comprehension, an effect reported to us by many of our testers.'","Hit app was downloaded over 1.6 million times on its first day .

"By . James Nye for MailOnline . An eight-year-old boy was covered in pepper spray, forced to eat his . own vomit, gagged and locked in a cabinet to silence his cries for help just days before his mother and her boyfriend allegedly beat him to death, according to court records published on Monday reports the Los Angeles Times. Gabriel Fernandez's mother, Pearl, 30, and her boyfriend, Isauro Aguirre, 34, abused 'every inch' of their child before his gruesome murder in May, 2013, a Los Angeles' court was told by prosecutors. Prosecutors claim that 'for eight straight months, Gabriel was abused, beaten and tortured more severely than many prisoners of war,' - even writing his own suicide note - and convened the grand jury after repeated delays in setting up a preliminary hearing for Fernandez and Aguirre who are charged with murder . Angel: Gabriel, 8, was found unconscious and not breathing, suffering from a fractured skull, cracked ribs and cigarette burns to his body . History of violence: Fernandez had previously been charged with cruelty to a child likely to produce great bodily injury . Charged: Pearl Fernandez, 30, (left) and boyfriend, Isauro Aguirre, 34, (right) are accused of shocking abuse towards their eight-year-old son Gabriel . Repeated warning signs were missed by authorities and in the aftermath of Gabriel's death two Los Angeles social workers were fired as were two supervisors according to the Los Angeles Times. The tragedy came to a head when Fernandez dialed 911 on May 22, 2013, because her son had stopped breathing. When deputies of Los Angeles County arrived she told them that her son had fallen and hit his head on a dresser, according to testimony given on Monday. However, the paramedics told the court that Gabriel was found in a bedroom, not breathing having suffered three broken ribs and a cracked skull. X-rays revealed BB pellets in his lungs and groin. Gabriel was rushed to hospital and died on May 24 testified James Cermak, a Los Angeles County Fire Department paramedic, who described the horrific abuse the boy allegedly suffered. The abuse lasted eight months said Deputy District Attorney Jonathan Hatami and became more pronounced before his death, according to statements given by his two siblings, who are both minors. They said that their brother was forced by their mother and her boyfriend to eat cat feces and rotten spinach and was never allowed to go to the bathroom. His mother and her boyfriend would call him gay and beat him when he played with dolls and made him wear girls' clothes to school. Accused: Pearl Fernandez has pleaded not-guilty to murdering and torturing her eight-year-old son Gabriel . He was hit with a belt buckle, a metal hanger and a wooden club and one day Fernandez knocked his teeth out with the bat. This sustained abuse led to several reports to social services by concerned teachers but Gabriel was never removed from his home. Indeed, deputies investigated the family home and Gabriel's school for signs of abuse and that the boy had claimed to be suicidal. Every time an incident was reported it was concluded there was no abuse and no one ever wrote up a detailed report. The grand jurors were told by Timothy O'Quinn, a sheriff's homicide detective, that no deputies took away items of clothing for testing. After Gabriel's death, investigators found clothes covered in blood, BB pellet holes in them and a wooden club doused in blood. Social services in Los Angeles have begun a special commission to examine the failings of the department before Gabriel's death, according to the Los Angeles Times. On the day of May 22, 2013, Gabriel's siblings told the grand jury that Fernandez beat her son because he wouldn't clean up his toys. Horrific claims: Police say Gabriel had marking on his ankles, suggesting that he may have been tied up . Crime scene: Firefighters responded to this home in the 200 block of East Avenue Q-10 in Palmdale after receiving a report that a child was not breathing . Then she took him to a bedroom and was joined by Aguirre and chillingly, the next thing Gabriel's siblings heard was screaming and banging and then silence. Gabriel's 13-year-old brother said, 'It just went quiet'. According to the Los Angeles Times, James Kemp Ribe of the LA County coroner's office told the grand jury that he had 'never seen this many skin injuries on on child.' A teacher, Jennifer Garcia, told the court that she had tried to contact social services after Gabriel arrived at school with black eyes and bruises. One of the social workers who followed up on this said that all she could determine that Gabriel had was a blister on his lip. Another counselor at his school phoned 911 after finding a suicide note that Gabriel wrote, which social workers again dismissed because they determined he had no specific plan to carry out the plan to end his life. Worse still, when authorities came to interview Gabriel's siblings, they revealed to the grand jury they lied because they were terrified their mother and her boyfriend would beat them too. The agency's director Philip Browning acknowledged the system failed Gabriel. The case illustrates a need for more critical thinking and common sense in evaluating cases, he said. County social workers became aware of Pearl Fernandez a decade ago when her oldest son had a head injury during a car accident. It was determined he wasn't wearing a seat belt. The Times said a relative later reported she allegedly beat the same son and wanted to disown him. However, social workers said the complaint was unfounded.","Grand jury in Los Angeles heard testimony about the last year of Gabriel Fernandez's life .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . A report issued by investigators inside the Environmental Protection Agency found rampant abuse in employees' use of the agency's government credit cards, warning that officials were ignoring a long list of safeguards designed to avoid the waste of taxpayer dollars. The EPA's Office of Inspector General found $79,254 in 'prohibited, improper or erroneous' spending in a sample of $152,602 in transactions. And more than 93 per cent of the time the employees used the cards, they 'were not in compliance with EPA policies,' the IG wrote. 'These transactions represented purchases of gym memberships, food [and] hotel space,' according to the report. And many purchases were 'split' among two or more transactions in order to avoid spending more than $3,000 at a time – an amount that should trigger more extensive scrutiny. Some of the 80 transactions the IG chose to audit represented payments to vendors listed in the categories like 'dance hall,' 'child care' or 'theater and music,' the report explains. Cha-ching! Several EPA employees used taxpayer-funded credit cards to buy themselves -- and their families -- gym memberships . EPA employees with government credit cards spent taxpayer dollars on gym memberships, gift cards, and even charity donations . Seven separate cases were identified where EPA employees bought untraceable gift cards with taxpayer funds. 'In one example, 20 American Express gift cards were purchased for $1,588 to provide on-the-spot awards,' the IG reported. 'There was no third-party verification that any awardees received the gift cards.' Congress has given the EPA $8.2 billion to spend this year, which is $50 million more than the Obama White House asked for. Three of the 80 transactions the IG reviewed were for 'gym memberships that required pre-payment for services totaling $2,867.' 'Two of those purchases were for family memberships, and not just the EPA employee,' the report explains. In addition, 35 per cent of the time the employees with the credit cards never verified that the items they bought were received. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy (C) has her hands full trying to persuade the coal industry that it's not headed for extinction -- and now this ... Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative anti-tax group in Washington, unearthed the March 4 report on Wednesday. 'An obvious culture of improper spending has developed at the EPA with little to no oversight,' the organization said in a statement. 'Thus in years to come Americans could again find themselves paying for EPA employees' gym memberships, gift cards, and whatever else may strike their fancy.' ATR president Grover Norquist took it in stride. 'The world is divided in two groups,' Norquist told MailOnline: 'Those who are not surprised that bureaucrats handed credit cards might misuse the opportunity, and those who believe deeply in unicorns.' 'Who is supervising this circus?' he asked. Four of the transactions the EPA's IG examined were categorized as 'charity' expenditures. They totaled $1,750.","The Environmental Protection Agency's inspector general found 75 of the 80 transactions it examined involved waste, fraud or abuse .

Refuse workers were collecting wheelie bins from businesses on Shirley Road in Southampton at around 8am yesterday morning when their truck malfunctioned and emptied its entire contents in the middle of the road. The team were left shovelling the rubbish with a mechanical street sweeper for over an hour causing traffic chaos for those trying to make their way to work. A refuse worker stands by the truck which malfunctioned and dumped its entire contents on busy Shirley Road in Southampton during rush hour yesterday morning - causing traffic chaos for those trying to get to work . Southampton City Council has now launched an investigation into the incident and is reviewing its entire fleet of similar vehicles. Steve Locke, who runs a recruitment agency on the street, said: ‘It was quite funny to be fair. ‘I don’t think it was anybody’s fault. ‘The workers ran to hit the stop button but it never stopped unloading. There was nothing anyone could do.’ Benedict Carey, who captured the moment on his mobile phone as he stood nearby, said: ‘It certainly was a bizarre sight. ‘I did say to the operators “okay, who pressed the wrong button?” ‘They claimed it wasn’t possible to do that, and that we should blame “city council cutbacks”. ‘They seemed in pretty good humour about the whole thing.’ Southampton City Council has now launched an investigation into the incident on Shirley Road (pictured) as well as reviewing its entire fleet of similar vehicles after workers were left shovelling rubbish off the busy street . The arrival of a JCB eventually sped up the clean-up process, successfully clearing the road.

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . A pregnant barmaid who was beaten up by a drunk mother at a wedding reception despite begging her to stop because she was expecting has given birth to a healthy baby boy. Rachael Bonney, 26, was seven weeks pregnant when she was attacked by Sarah Etchells, 34, who became infuriated after she was told to keep the noise down as the party came to an end at the Railway Club in Bolton, Greater Manchester. Etchells, who also attacked an elderly couple working at the pub, attempted to punch Miss Bonney in the stomach as she protected her unborn child. Rachael Bonney pictured with her son Carter, who was born in April, after she was beaten up by drunk Sarah Etchells at a wedding reception held at bar where she worked in Bolton while she was seven-weeks-pregnant . The incident started at around midnight as celebrations began to wind down and the club’s 76-year-old secretary Harold Foulkes began popping balloons during the clean-up, waking up Etchell’s daughter. She began ranting at the pensioner before moving outside with the rest of the party where they continued to be noisy. Mr Foulke’s wife Eileen, 75, politely asked Etchells to keep the noise down as the club, which has a sign asking customers to be quiet, has houses nearby. But Etchells responded by punching the elderly woman in the face whilst her husband Nicholas Etchells, 52, attacked Mr Foulkes – punching him in the head and face, causing his nose to bleed. Married mother-of-three Sarah Etchells, 34, arriving at Bolton Crown Court where she admitted assault and was ordered to carry out 250 hours unpaid work after the attacks which happened in August 2013 . Fearing their attackers, the Foulkes got in their car with Miss Bonney and two other members of staff who were already in the back, but the punches continued through the open window while Mrs Etchells jumped in the car and began attacking the pregnant woman. Miss Bonney said: ‘The guests started shouting verbal abuse at Harold, calling him a paedo. It was horrific. ‘Sarah Etchells came over to the car and asked Eileen to get out. Eileen got out of the car because as a 75-year-old woman you don’t expect to get hit, but the next thing Etchells took her shoes off, ran around the back of the car and smacked Eileen in the face. ‘I knew I was seven weeks pregnant, so all I could think about was protecting my baby. I thought “if I lose this baby I will never forgive myself.” I knew I couldn’t get out of the car because it would put my baby in danger. I was petrified and felt helpless.’ ‘Sarah Etchells jumped in the car beside me and started punching me in the face and pulling my hair. I panicked and said: ‘Don’t be hitting me, I am pregnant.’ I thought it might stop her from attacking me but she replied: “You’re pregnant, are you? You’re pregnant?’ And then she started going for my stomach. “I couldn’t do anything except try to protect my stomach. I had my arms and legs up trying to protect the baby but she didn’t stop, she just hit my arms and legs instead. She was like a woman possessed. ‘When we got to hospital I realised I had scratches on my chest. Luckily the baby was fine and I had a normal pregnancy after the attack but I was an emotional wreck after what happened. The whole thing was just so traumatic. What happened to Harold and Eileen was terrible.’ Mr Foulkes was punched in the face knocking off his spectacles and hearing aid. He suffered bruising to both eyes, severe facial swelling and bruising, a cut top lip and a cracked tooth. His wife suffered a large bruise to her left temple and other minor facial injuries during the incident in late August 2013. At Bolton Crown Court, Etchells, from Farnworth, near Bolton, was ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work after admitting assault and criminal damage. Her painter and decorator husband and a third attacker Dale Hughes, 27, a fork lift truck driver, were each locked away for 18 months for assault. Now almost a year after her ordeal, Miss Bonney, who is due to marry her long-term partner in 2015, has given birth to a son Carter weighing 8lb after an emergency caesarean section. Trouble started at the Railway Club in Bolton after a wedding reception the Etchells had been attending started to wind down and Mrs Etchells was asked to keep the noise down. She reacted by lashing out at elderly couple Harold and Eileen Foulkes along with her husband Nicholas Etchells, 52, who was sent to prison for 18 months . Painter and decorator and Sarah Etchells husband Nicholas Etchells (left) and fork lift truck driver Dale Hughes, 27, were given 18 month prison sentences for their part in the assaults of the Foulkes and Miss Bonney . She said: ‘Carter is perfect in every way but if I hadn’t managed to protect myself God knows what might have happened to him the way that woman was behaving that night. ‘I think Sarah Etchells should have gone to prison especially as there were others who were far more seriously injured than me. ‘She started the whole thing and that night she was like a woman possessed. In my mind if I hadn’t managed to protect myself she would have landed some punches on my baby bump and the consequences of that could have been dreadful.’ The injuries sustained by the club's 76-year-old secretary Harold Foulkes who had asked Etchells to be quiet .

"By . Jonathan Block . Last month, the EPA accused Johnson, who lives in Fort Bridger, a tiny town of just 345 people in the southwestern part of the state, of violating the Clean Water Act for damming up a creek and polluting water by building his pond. Johnson, who works as a welder, built the pond five years ago, but he says, got permission to do so, including the right the dam up the Six Mile Creek, from Wyoming state agencies. However, the EPA says he violated the Clean Water Act since he built a dam and failed to get approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. An aerial shot of Fort Bridger, Wyoming near the home of Andy Johnson who is fighting the EPA over accusations his homemade pond violates the law . Johnson, however, contends the EPA is applying the law incorrectly as he built a stock pond, which should make it exempt. 'I think they’re trying to gain jurisdiction,' Johnson told the Deseret News. 'They’re trying to see if they can run over me, and then they will get into everyone’s irrigation ditch and stock ponds throughout not only Wyoming, but the United States.' A Wyoming State Engineer’s Office letter from 2012 appears to back up Johnson's claim that he is not running foul of the law. 'Said permit is in good standing and is entitled to be exercised exactly as permitted,' the letter reads, according to FoxNews.com. Although he received state approval, the EPA contends he failed to get the blessing of federal authorities who have the ultimate say. In addition, the EPA says that because Six Mile Creek is tributary of the Blacks Fork River, which itself a tributary of the Green River, it is part of the 'waters of the United States.' Therefore, it falls under federal jurisdiction and the Clean Water Act. The EPA regional office is housed in this federal building in Helena, Montana which covers western states including Wyoming . Johnson counters that's a stretch as water in the creek is spread out and almost never makes it the 100 miles from Fort Bridget to the Green River. 'The pond doesn't start in a river or end in a river,' he said. The feds started getting on his case starting in 2012 after the Army Corps of Engineers inspected the pond and concluded the dam he made ended up leading 'dredged and fill material.' Johnson has appealed to Wyoming's two Republican senators, John Barrasso and Mike Enzi for help. The pair wrote to the EPA on his behalf, but the agency is budging. And Johnson isn't backing down either. 'I want to stand up for what I believe in, for what I’ve worked for,' he said. 'I feel like I’m entitled to that. I pay taxes, I live in this country and I’m going to fight it to the end'","Andy Johnson of Fort Bridger received approval from state agencies but EPA contends he failed to get OK from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers .

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . George McLachrie, 19, was given a restraining order after he continued to harass his girlfriend after split . An IT student was handed a restraining order after he harassed his ex-girlfriend by taking pictures of her house at night and creeping up behind her shouting ‘BOO’. George McLachrie continued to contact Malissa Buasri after the pair split up in February this year, even though he was told he was not wanted. The 19-year-old from Pinvin, Worcestershire, was given a harassment notice by police in March and a further warning in April. But the day after his second warning he crept up behind his former girlfriend at a train station and said ‘boo’ – which left her to be startled and upset. He also took a picture of the back of her house in Ledbury, Herefordshire, at night and posted it on the app Snapchat with the caption ‘I can’t see you’. The teenager admitted harassment without violence when he appeared at Worcester Magistrates Court on Friday. District judge Nigel Cadbury said McLachrie had continued with his pattern of behaviour for ‘just a bit too long’. Prosecutor Adrian Jones told the court the teenager harassed Miss Buarsi between April 28 and May 1 by ‘startling’ her and taking a picture of her home. He said the pair had been in a short relationship which started in November last year and ended in February. Mr Jones added: ‘On April 30 the defendant walked up behind the complainant at Foregate Street train station and said ‘boo’ causing her to be startled and upset.’ Speaking about the incident when he posted a picture of her house on Snapchat, he added: ‘This caused the complainant to be fearful for her safety.’ The court heard McLachrie told police he understood his behaviour was harassment and said he did it to ‘wind up the complainant’s friend’. Despite a harassment order he crept up behind her at train station and took picture of her house in dark . Defending the IT student, Amer Hussain said McLachrie and Miss Buasri both attended the Heart of Worcestershire College. He added: ‘There have been no further complaints of any further behaviour. He has not engaged with her and hasn’t sent her any text messages. ‘He is beginning to make the adjustment that the relationship has come to its natural conclusion. ‘He describes it as being his first significant relationship, his first significant girlfriend. ‘He has altered his behaviour.’ He escaped a prison sentence but was given a conditional discharge of two years and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. He was also handed a two-year restraining order which states that he must not contact Miss Buasari directly or go within half-a-mile of her home.

Everything is touch-friendly, as you swipe across screens to access more tiles and more tiles. This is the new version of Windows, and it is almost ready for prime-time, with Microsoft preparing Windows 8 for launch in October. Windows fans may lament their loss, but Microsoft has seen the future, and it is all about touch. Bye bye desktop, hello Metro! The new Windows will look very different to all previous versions . The new Windows Store takes some ideas from Android and Apple's mobile app stores, and users swipe right-to-left across screens for more options . Microsoft officially announced the . time-frame for Windows 8's mass-market release this morning at a company . conference in Toronto. New . versions of Windows typically come out every three years, but this . update is the most widely anticipated overhaul of the software since . 1995. Microsoft, based in Redmond, . Washington, has designed the operating system so it can run on personal . computers or touch-based tablet computers. Desktop aficionados may lament the new focus on touch - and wonder how it will work on older, non-touchscreen computers. Critics may also wonder whether touch is any kind of replacement for keyboard and mouse in terms of day-to-day productivity. Luckily those who miss the old approach will still find their Desktop accessible. But now it is more like a program, in the same way Office or Photoshop are programs. The company is also putting a special . price on its next version of Windows - offering upgrades to the . operating system for just $40. The offer, which translates to about . £25 in the UK, will run until next January and applies to the previous . versions of Windows - XP, Vista, and Windows 7. Microsoft has not yet confirmed the price in the UK yet, but the company is likely to price the upgrade at between £25 and £40. Microsoft will also throw Media Centre, which allows you to browse picture, music and video files from a distance, in for free. The new panels add items such as weather widgets and social network updates . Microsoft will be anxious to get the . latest Windows on to as many desktops as possible, following the rising . popularity of Android and Apple tablets, and Google and Apple - as well . as other companies - encroaching in on the Microsoft-heavy segment of . the PC market. Windows 8 . will be quite an evolution.

A New York Jets supporter who became a national hate figure last October after footage of him punching a female New England Patriots fan in the face appeared online is unrepentant about his actions after his ban from the MetLife Stadium was rescinded. Kurt Paschke, a former convicted killer, was involved in an altercation with a group of Patriots fans which resulted in him punching Jaclyn Nugent, 27, following his team's last-minute 30-27 win. Paschke, 39, of Long Island, New York, maintains that he didn’t start the trouble. He claims that he was provoked by Nugent and the group of Patriots fans and that he was protecting his mother.

Then the verbal abuse continued after the game and someone even spat on him. 'So I turn around and start screaming, ""What the f**k!"" But they then ran past my mother and I, shoved my mother to the ground, jumped on my friend Chris and Laura from behind. He maintains that he was 'trying to break it up'. That is the point at which the fight in the 35 second video clip began, he claims. Dragged away: The man in the number 80 green jersey is already being removed from the brawl by another man .

'In the video what you don’t see... is some guy hitting me in the face two more times. Finally... I just swing, and unfortunately it wasn’t the guy, it was the girl,' he said, adding that he wasn’t drunk. Two days after the incident, Paschke and three of the Patriots fans – including Nugent - were arrested and charged with simple assault and disorderly conduct. Nugent was one of two people observed kicking and punching Paschke. In March, the fan-assault charges were . reduced to a $289 ticket for ‘unnecessary noise,’ according to the East . Rutherford Municipal Court. Paschke also said he didn't think his ban was very fair when compared to the two game ban that Ravens star Ray Rice, right, received for assaulting his wife .

This is the heart-stopping moment a woman almost died when a car left the road and ploughed into a tanning salon – and she only escaped because of her ‘lightning’ reactions. CCTV images show the woman walking down a pavement in Hathershaw, Greater Manchester, wearing a dark coat and carrying a bag at her side. She reaches the crossing just moments before a car hurtles in her direction from the main road and crashes into the side of Tanning Salon 365, which was closed at the time. This is the moment a woman almost died after a car left a road and came crashing towards her on a pavement . The scene following the crash, which was attended by emergency services and allegedly involved another car . The car left the road and crashed into the side of Tanning Salon 365 - which fortunately was closed at the time . Her quick reactions meant she spotted the car and had milliseconds to turn and flee as it headed straight for her. The car was slowed by the impact after hitting a pelican crossing post, allowing the woman enough time to escape. The frightening scenes were captured on CCTV at around 8.15pm last Wednesday – when the woman appeared to escape without injury. Footage also showed that moments before the crash a couple with a child passed the very same spot. Kate Mellor, from Keep Active Mobility - a shop linked to where the CCTV was filmed, said: ‘I was absolutely shocked, we had seen the lamppost and things, I just can't get over that poor woman. ‘I've heard the sound on the CCTV and there's no sound of screeching of tyres or anything to warn her. I walk my dog around there and if it had been me it would have had me over. The woman can be seen wearing a dark coat and carrying a bag at her side as she approaches the crossing .

"By . David Mccormack for MailOnline . A father whose teenage son was found guilty of killing four and seriously injuring two others while driving drunk has been arrested for impersonating a police officer in Texas. Fred Couch’s son Ethan, 16, was only sentenced to ten years’ probation in December following the horrific car wreck after his defense attorney argued he suffered from a condition called 'affluenza' which means he is so spoiled by his mother and father he is not fully responsible for his actions. Couch senior was arrested on Tuesday morning after he was found to have falsely identified himself as a police officer at an incident in North Richland Hills in the early hours of July 28. Fred Couch, whose teenage son Ethan was found guilty of killing four and seriously injuring two others while driving drunk, has been arrested for impersonating a police officer in North Richland Hills, Texas . Officers responding to a disturbance call at a house report that Couch was already on the scene when they arrived, . Police say he identified himself as a reserve officer in Lakeside, a small town located about 12 miles northeast of Fort Worth. After officers had completed their disturbance investigation they turned their attention to Couch, who insisted he was a Lakeside Police Department reserve officer, reports WFAA. 'Couch reached into his vehicle and took out his wallet displaying what appeared to be a police badge and identification card, suggesting he was a police officer,' North Richland Hills investigator K. Bauman said. Ethan Couch, 16, was sentenced to ten years' probation in December after his defense attorney argued he suffered from a condition called 'affluenza' which means he is so spoiled by his mother and father he is not fully responsible for his actions . Ethan Couch's parents Tonya, left, and Fred, right, have more than 20 criminal and traffic offense claims on their records - but have never served any time in prison . 'Upon completion of the call, all subjects involved were allowed to leave the location.' But the officers kept looking into Couch’s claim, and after doing some digging, determined that he has never been licensed as a Texas peace officer. Couch was arrested and charged with False Identification As A Police Officer: Misrepresentation Of Property. He was later released after posting bond set at $2,500.00. Millionaire sheet metal manufacturer Fred and ex-wife Tonya have more than 20 criminal and traffic offense claims on their records - but have never served any time in prison. They have several driving citations on . their records and Mr Couch has been arrested for alleged crimes . including theft, evading arrest and an alleged assault against Mrs . Couch, according to official court documents obtained at the Johnson County Court records office in Cleburne. But . aside from a number of small fines for their motoring offenses and a . six-month community supervision order issued to Mrs Couch, neither of . them have been punished further. Previous: . Fred couch, Ethan Couch's father, has a long list of criminal and . traffic citations against him on record from speeding charges, theft to . even assault against his now ex-wife, Tonya . Criminal: Mother Tonya Couch paid a $500 for driving another motorist off the road . Spared: . Ethan Couch was sentenced to 10-years probation rather than 20-years in . jail after he killed 4 people in a DUI incident in June . In fact all of the more serious cases against Mr Couch, going back as far as 1989, have been dismissed. Charges were dropped in the two theft cases, because Mr Couch paid substantial restitution. That my be particularly relevant to his son's case. Gerry Miller, a psychologist testifying on behalf of the defense in Ethan Couch’s trial, told the court: ‘The teen never learned to say that you’re sorry if you hurt someone. If you hurt someone, you sent him money.’ A source at the Johnson County court records office in Cleburne told MailOnline that Mr Couch ‘must have a very good attorney’. According to official documentation, Mr Couch, 48, has a blizzard of 22 accusations on his record, made up of four criminal misdemeanor allegations and 18 traffic violations. They resulted in nine driving citation fines for offenses ranging from doing 95mph in a 60mph zone, to driving without his license.The majority of the other citations were dismissed. On top of that he has been arrested over allegations of theft twice and evading arrest once. In June 1988 he allegedly bought a $46 pair of shoes with a worthless check, but the case was dismissed after he ‘paid full restitution of $830.56’. Killed: . Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were helping . out the driver of a broken down SUV when they were struck and killed by . Couch's out-of-control pickup . Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash . In April 1992 he was again accused of using a worthless check, this time to buy $26.41 of gas. And again the case was dismissed after he paid $274.80. Two years earlier he was accused of evading arrest. That case was also dismissed, although it is unclear why from court records. And in 1996 he was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife. Records state he, ‘intentionally and knowingly caused bodily injury to Tonya Couch by striking’ her ‘on or about the face with his hands causing Tonya to fall, and by grabbing’ her ‘on or about the neck with his hands, scratching’ her ‘neck’. On that occasion Mrs Couch submitted a sworn affidavit of non-prosecution, meaning the case was dismissed. Her police record is shorter. In 2003 she was charged with a misdemeanor offense of reckless driving after she, ‘intentionally and knowingly drove a motor vehicle in a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property’. Court records say she pulled up behind a fellow motorist and then pulled alongside them forcing them onto the shoulder of the road. Mrs Couch was hit with a $500 fine and a six month community supervision order. She was also stopped for speeding and three counts of failing to adequately secure children under 17-years-old that same year. Left . alone to live in luxury: This is the mansion on Burleson Retta Rd. in . Burleson, Texas that Ethan Couch hosted wild parties at while . unsupervised . The defense attorney hired by Fred and Tonya Couch to act on behalf of their son slammed their parenting skills and blamed them for their son’s horrendous actions, which happened at around 11.45pm on June 15. Couch and a group his friends got into a red Ford F350 pick-up – owned by his father’s company - and were speeding at 70mph in a 40mph zone when the truck left the road. As it careered out of control, it clipped a broken down SUV, throwing the owner and four Good Samaritans, who were trying to help, 60 yards in the air. Youth pastor Brian Jennings, mother and daughter Hollie and Shelby Boyles and 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell were all killed on impact. Trial notes claim the cocky teenager said 'I'm Ethan Couch, I'll get you out of this,' to one of his passengers at the scene. It was revealed soon after that his blood-alcohol level was 0.24 - three times the adult limit, though minors aren't allowed any alcohol in their system - and that he was also on the prescription drug Valium when he started the chain reaction of crashes. The impact flung the four people 50 to 60 yards, authorities reported. In court a top defense attorney hired by the Couch family argued that the teen was not responsible for his actions. Dr Miller, blamed his behavior on his parents, claiming they gave him whatever he wanted including 'freedoms no young person should have'. Respectable face: Frederick Couch (left) who . owns a metal works, Cleburne Sheet Metal, that has an estimated yearly . turnover of $15 million and around 30 staff is seen in a picture from a . company brochure while (right) is Tonya . A cross is all the remains of the crash site: Ethan Couch, 16, was driving under the influence when he killed 4 in a crash that occurred a short distance from his father's house on Burleson Retta Rd. in Burleson, Texas . Dr Miller called Couch a product of 'affluenza,' where his family felt their wealth bought privilege and there was no rational link between behavior and consequences. 'The teen never learned to say that you’re sorry if you hurt someone,' Dr Miller said, according to the Star Telegram. 'If you hurt someone, you sent him money.' State District Judge Jean Boyd appeared to agree with the defense and gave him ten years’ probation and counseling at a 'country club'-style treatment center - at a cost of $450,000 in  Newport Beach, California, paid for by his father. The ruling caused outrage around the nation, with many claiming Couch only escaped jail because of his parents' wealth.","Fred Couch has been arrested for impersonating a police officer in North Richland Hills, Texas .

The mammoth beast, which measured 15-feet long and weighed 1,011.5 pounds, was captured by five members of the Stokes family near Thomaston. It took the family, consisting of Mandy Stokes, husband John Stokes, brother-in-law Kevin Jenkins and his children Savannah, 16, and Parker, 14, ten hours to capture the monster. Mandy Stokes, husband John Stokes, brother-in-law Kevin Jenkins and his children Savannah, 16, and Parker, 14, pose alongside the 15-feet long and 1,011.5 pound alligator they captured on the weekend . The mammoth beast, which measured 15-feet long and weighed 1,011.5 pounds, was captured near Thomaston, Alabama . The hunt started on Friday night and lasted well into Saturday morning. Mandy Stokes said her crew went through the full range of emotions as they first staked the animal,  before battling it, then killing it and finally struggling to take it back to shore. ‘He came up just as calm as he could,’ Mandy Stokes told AL.com. ‘When I pulled the trigger this time, water just exploded on all of us.’ When they finally got the beast back to dry land, he was so big that he crushed the winch system normally used by Alabama Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries biologists. Alligators are the only dangerous-game species that can legally be hunted in Alabama . The Stokes' gator measured 70.5 inches around the stomach, 46 inches around the base of the tail and had a 16-inch snout measurement . Alligators are the only dangerous-game species that can legally be hunted in the state. In the end, a backhoe had to be brought in to lift the animal and officially weigh it. The mammoth gator has now been officially named as the largest ever legally harvested in Alabama and it could even be a new world record. In June, Safari Club International declared a 14-foot, 8-inch, 880-pound alligator killed in Chalk Creek near Lufkin, Texas by Justin Wells of Bossier City, La., in 2007 as the new world record. It isn't clear which metric - length, weight or a combination of both - SCI used to come to its decision. The Stokes' gator measured 70.5 inches around the stomach, 46 inches around the base of the tail and had a 16-inch snout measurement. Following his capture and being weighed, his next stop was scheduled to be Ken Owens' Autaugaville taxidermy shop.

A mother humpback whale and her calf have been snapped riding a swell at the iconic Banzai Pipeline on Oahu’s North Shore in Hawaii. Dozens of beach-goers flocked to watch Saturday's unusual display, which was captured by photographer J.T. Gray of North Shore Surf Photos. The incredible photo shows six-time world bodyboarding champion Guilherme Tamega carving a set, followed by two humpback whales cruising behind on a second swell. Incredible: Photographer J.T. Gray of North Shore Surf Photos captured the rare moment a mother humpback whale and her calf rode a wave on the north shore of Oahu, Hawaii on Saturday. The surfer on the closest wave is six-time world bodyboarding champion Guilherme Tamega . Gray told GrindTV that while it's common to see dolphins ride a wave, it is unusual behavior for whales. 'The whales were 75 to 100 yards east of Pipeline and playing for a while, then swam to about 10 yards outside of the lineup,' he said. 'A set came in and the bodyboarder caught the first wave, and the humpbacks caught the second. 'Whales frequent Hawaii in the winter months, but never that close to shore.' He said the whales were a mother and . calf, suggesting they could have been playing, or perhaps that the . mother was keeping tabs on her cheeky calf.

"By . Arthur Martin . and Stephen Johns For The Daily Mail . and Steph Cockroft . and Wills Robinson for MailOnline . An international manhunt was continuing last night for the traffickers and lorry driver who tried to smuggle 35 desperate Afghan Sikhs into Britain in a shipping container that became a ‘metal coffin’. Full details of the horrifying incident have emerged in a video of the moment 34 of the migrants – including 13 children – were rescued. The footage shows them weak and confused after their wailing and banging alerted rescuers at the port of Tilbury, Essex, on Saturday morning. They were pulled sobbing from the sealed container in which they had been left to suffocate, but not before one of the migrants died. Scroll down for video . Some of the survivors, aged from one to 72, were so dehydrated that they had to be lifted out by police. Others could be seen sitting dazed on the pavement as paramedics treated the most severely injured. Most of the survivors were discharged from hospitals yesterday and taken to a reception centre where they were questioned by police and Border Force officials through interpreters. Callous people-traffickers had crammed the migrants – all from Afghanistan’s beleaguered Sikh community – into the container packed with crates of cleaning chemicals and put it on a P&O cargo ferry from the Belgium port of Zeebrugge on Friday night before fleeing. Police have launched a murder inquiry and are working with Interpol in a bid to track down the gang. Officers in Belgium are studying CCTV images of the lorry in an attempt to find the driver to establish if he was involved in the operation or was unaware of his human cargo. This footage shows the dramatic moment that 35 immigrants - including 12 children and a baby - were released . from a shipping containing yesterday morning, after being discovered at . the Port of Tilbury, Essex . In the disturbing footage, the immigrants - now confirmed as Afghan . Sikhs - can be seen crawling helplessly around the floor, while . harrowing screams echo around the dock . A Belgian police spokesman said it was impossible for the migrants to have climbed into the container while it was sitting in the port as it was there for only an hour and the area is covered extensively by CCTV. This . incident has chilling echoes of a tragedy 14 years ago in which 58 . Chinese stowaways died on the way from Belgium to Britain. Customs . officers discovered the bodies of 54 men and four women in the back of a . tomato lorry which arrived in Dover on June 18, 2000.  The migrants had . suffocated after their air vent was closed. Driver Perry Wacker was jailed for 14 years for manslaughter. ‘It was around 6pm so it wasn’t dark,’ he said. ‘We think that the possibility [is that] the victims were already on the container before it was put down in Zeebrugge.’ He said investigators have been combing CCTV and are 'very hopeful' that they can track down the driver and company of the vehicle that deposited the container. Mr De Waele added each container is captured on camera and their seals are subject to 'very strict' controls. His officers were working closely with Essex police, he added, and he described . tackling human trafficking as a 'priority' in Belgium. One report . claimed yesterday that the stowaways spent nine days locked inside . before they were found. Police believe a second container with 12 people . inside is still to be found, the report claimed. Zeebrugge has become a popular port for people smugglers because of its size and regular cargo ferry crossings to Britain. The . number of ‘clandestine illegal entry attempts’ by migrants trying to . get to the UK via ports in Belgium and France increased last year to . 18,000 from about 11,000 the year before, according UK Border Agency . figures. Police and border officials are seen trying to help the immigrants, as . several collapse onto the floor, letting out desperate cries for help . Essex police have confirmed the group included nine men and eight women aged between 18 and 72, as well as 13 children, aged between one and 12 years old . Thirteen children, aged as young as one, were among the Afghan Sikhs rescued from a shipping container on Saturday . The . Tilbury container had been loaded from a lorry on to P&O’s . Norstream ferry at Zeebrugge on Friday at 9.20pm. The ship arrived in . Essex at around 6am on Saturday. The alarm was raised some half an hour later when the desperate pleas for help were heard. An immediate search was ordered of the other 50 containers on the ferry in case any more migrants were on board. Superintendent . Trevor Roe, of Essex Police, said: ‘We have had a good deal of help . from partners within the local Sikh community in the Tilbury area to . ensure that these poor people, who would have been through a horrific . ordeal, are supported in terms of their religious and clothing needs.’ Stephen . Metcalfe, Conservative MP for South Basildon and East Thurrock, said: . ‘The fact that so many people appear to have travelled so far and are so . desperate to get into the UK – either on their own or being trafficked – . is really sad.’ Dock . workers made the shocking discovery at 6.37am on Saturday morning after . they heard 'screaming and banging' coming from inside one of the ship's . containers . Migrants in France and Belgium typically pay gangs about £1,500 each to be smuggled into Britain. They have often travelled from their home countries by land via Turkey before being herded into UK-bound containers. Alternatively, some are flown to Moscow on fake visas before being driven across Eastern Europe. Supt Roe added: . 'Now they are well enough, our officers and colleagues from the Border . Force will be speaking to them via interpreters so we can piece together . what happened and how they came to be in the container. 'We . now understand that they are from Afghanistan and are of the Sikh . faith. Members of the Sikh community in Thurrock, Essex, are helping . support the victims alongside the Red Cross.' Some 32 people had been released from local hospitals by last night . to a reception centre at the Port of Tilbury. The two remaining victims . were continuing to be treated at Southend Hospital today. A Belgian police spokesman said it would be 'impossible' for the illegal immigrants to have boarded the vessel (pictured at Tilbury Docks yesterday) at Zeebrugge . Sikhs are a tiny minority in Afghanistan with only 3,000 members of the community in a population of 31 million. Most of them are said to have migrated to other countries including India, Canada, Germany and Britain. Their mass exodus began when the mujahideen came to power in 1992, following the Soviet withdrawal from the country and the collapse of the communist Najibullah regime. Until the civil war, they, along with Hindus and Jews, controlled money markets in major towns including Kabul, Jalalabad and Kandahar. But when the conflict began, gurudwaras around the country were destroyed and many were forced to flee. When the Taliban ruled the country in 2001, the Sikhs were forced to wear yellow tags, and the women were made to wear veils. In 2009, a spokesman for the Hindu-Sikh Society in Afghanistan, Daya Singh Anjaa, told RFI (Radio France Internationale) that the group are now impoverished and are struggling to find a place in Afghan society.

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . He grew up in a leafy London suburb, born to a mother who now works as a dinner lady and a father who sold clothes at John Lewis. Now Aine Davis is fighting with ISIS in Syria, and has swapped family portraits for poses in combat fatigues, surrounded by rebel soldiers holding AK47s. The 30-year-old was at the centre of an Old Bailey trial last week that saw his wife, Amal El-Wahabi, jailed for funding terrorism while university student Nawal Msaad, 27, was sensationally cleared of trying to smuggle £16,000 in her underwear to Syria. Scroll down for video . The first picture of Aine Davis (without a mask) in Syria. He travelled to the Middle East to join the extremists last year and is still believed to be involved in the fighting . A mobile phone picture shows Davis posing with a fellow rebel fighter holding an AK47 . Throughout the trial, the jury heard that El-Wahabi, the mother of Davis's two children, was sending him money in the Middle East. The pair would keep in contact via WhatsApp, with Davis sending her photos of him as a jihadi soldier alongside messages urging her to join him. Police are now investigating Davis's links to other extremists in London and are trying to trace the network which raised the funds his hairdresser wife then sent to him. An investigation by The Sunday Telegraph has uncovered information about his upbringing, including his rise from a petty criminal to a drug dealer -  adopting the nickname 'Biggz' while part of a London gang. Davis was born Aine Leslie Junior Davis in 1984 to Fay Rodriquez, and is believed to have spent the early years of his childhood in Hammersmith where his mother lived. He was one of 13 children his father had by four different women. His father - who is thought to have been nicknamed Benno - is believed to have worked in John Lewis and would sell his family clothes at a staff discount. When he was just four-years-old, he was sent to Gambia to live with his grandmother, because he drove his mother 'crazy'. The former tube driver, who has drug-dealing and firearms convictions to his name, converted to Islam six or seven years ago while in prison, it is alleged. He was sentenced to two years in a young offenders' institution in 2004 after he was caught with a firearm in a taxi. During his jail term, he is thought to have radicalised. According to Miss Rodriquez's Facebook page she is a dinner lady at the £15,000-a-year Latymer Upper School in west London. Last July, around the time Davis was thought to have travelled to Syria, she posted on the social media site: 'I would like everyone to know my girls... and my son aine [sic], you all mean the world to me and I'm proud of every single one of you.' Trial: Nawal Msaad, 27 (left), was sensationally acquitted of trying to smuggle £16,000 in euros to Syria at the Old Bailey last week, while her friend Amal El-Wahabi, was found guilty of funding terrorism . Miss Msaad, whose model looks have earned her the nickname ‘jihottie’ on social media sites, wept as she was cleared at the OId Bailey last week . During the Old Bailey trial, which ended last week, El-Wahabi told her friend Nawal Msaad the cash she was asked to smuggle in her underwear was to pay a deposit on a house in Turkey. But in reality, El-Wahabi was preparing to join her 30-year-old drug-dealing husband on his terrorist crusade, taking their two infant sons with her. Miss Msaad, whose model looks have earned her the nickname ‘jihottie’ on social media sites, wept as she was cleared. The London Metropolitan University human resources management undergraduate appeared during the trial to be a most unlikely jihadi sympathiser. Wahabi,  described by her own barrister as a ‘foul-mouthed, phone addicted, weed-smoking kaffir’, collapsed and screamed, ‘No, I can’t breathe’ as she was convicted of funding terrorism. She claimed she thought her husband, whom she met at a West London mosque when she was 19, was helping an aid convoy in Syria. But police found extremist videos sent by Davis, and photographs on Wahabi’s phone of him posing with an AK47 along with other fighters. She sent him a picture of their son in a jihadi headscarf. Wahabi will be sentenced on September 12. Judge Nicholas Hilliard warned she faces jail, saying: ‘A substantial amount of money was destined straight for the hands of a dangerous extremists engaged in violent jihad with all the terror and misery that causes.’ Family home: The mother of Aine Davis, Fay Rodriquez (left), and her London home (right)","Aine Davis, 30, grew up in Hammersmith, London, before becoming a jihadi .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Commuters in Nanjing have found themselves stepping into the biggest sporting stages in the world - or at least imitations of them, thanks to a subway train specially decorated to mark the 2014 Youth Olympics. The Chinese city is hosting the two-week long games, which feature 208 countries, 30 events and some of the world's most promising young athletes. To mark the occasion, the floors of this subway train have been turned into football pitches, basketball courts and even swimming pools - complete with athletes motoring along underwater. Unsurprisingly, China currently sit top of the medal table, with 10 medals including four golds. Russia are second and Hungary are third, while the USA sit just outside the top three in fourth and Great Britain and tenth, with one gold, two silvers and a bronze. Team GB's gold was won by Ben Dijkstra, 15, in the triathlon, beating New Zealand's Daniel Hoy in a nail-biting photo finish yesterday. This is only the second ever Youth Olympics, after Britain claimed nine medals in the inaugural tournament in Singapore four years ago. This time, 33 15-18-year-olds make up the team whose star is European junior gymnastics champion Ellie Downey. Her sister Rebecca competed in Beijing 2008, and Ellie will be hoping to follow in her footsteps in Rio in 2016.

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . Andrew Clarke, 42, was jailed for stealing £100,000 from his employer to pay for daughters' education at the Royal School in Haslemere, Surrey . A father has been jailed for stealing £100,000 from his employer to pay for his daughters’ £21,000-a-year private education because he felt ‘pressure’ from their mother. Andrew Clarke, 42, a financial controller, submitted a series of false invoices at F. E. Robinson Ltd in Hooton, Merseyside – almost costing the company and its 30 staff its business. He had been using the money to send his two daughters to the Royal School in Haslemere, Surrey, which was founded in 1840 with Queen Victoria as a founder donor and its president is Princess Anne – a regular visitor to the school. A court heard that he was only found out after his bosses became suspicious when he began taking holiday whenever external accountants came to check the figures. Clarke, who has previously been jailed for fraud, pleaded guilty at Chester Crown Court yesterday to one count of fraud between May 2012 and August 2013. Meirion Lewis-Jones, prosecuting, told the court Clarke had been hired by the managing director, Guy Williams, as a financial controller of the company. He said the family-run company makes ‘tooling materials’ which are used by Airbus in Broughton as well as consumer products such as wood-burning stoves. Mr Lewis-Jones said had a member of the Williams family not put in £150,000 to keep the company going, it would have gone out of business due to the fraud. The managing director became suspicious of Clarke, who is from Merseyside, after working with him for about seven months when the accounts he produced seemed ‘too optimistic’. An external accountancy firm was called in to look into the books and initially found nothing. Mr Lewis-Jones said Clarke began acting suspiciously by taking holidays whenever the external accountancy firm was checking the figures and the managing director became convinced the firm was missing money. It found Clarke had been giving in false invoices using legitimate suppliers names to the company with his bank details on, amounting to a total of £102,063.42. Clarke had been using the money to send his daughters to the Royal School in Haslemere, Surrey (pictured). Clarke pleaded guilty at Chester Crown Court to one count of . fraud between May 2012 and August 2013 . The school was founded in 1840 with Queen Victoria  and its president Princess Anne is a regular visitor . Clarke admitted his guilt when arrested by police and also confessed to what he was doing when confronted by Mr Williams and paid back £8,000. Mr Lewis-Jones told the court Clarke had previous convictions for fraud and in 2008, at Guildford Crown Court, he was given a community order for 18 offences of obtaining services by deception. In 2009 he was jailed for 15 months for 31 offences of making false representations to make a gain and he had asked for a further 94 offences to be taken into consideration by the court for a total fraud worth £54,803.35 from a southern based accountancy firm. Peter Barnett, defending, said the offences happened as Clarke felt ‘under pressure’ to continue paying his two daughters’ £7,000 per term school fees from his former partner. He also spent £1,000 on his second wedding to a new partner. Mr Barnett said Clarke had recently been diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum which meant, in his case, he was unable to tell the difference between problems - such as not being able to pay school fees - from a catastrophe which led him to criminality. Judge Raj Shetty, said while Clarke may have felt ‘pressure’, the main motivation was ‘straightforward greed’. Aerial view of the school: Clarke had previous convictions for fraud and was sentenced to two years in prison for the false invoices. He said he felt 'under pressure' to pay the fees from his former partner . His employers, F. E. Robinson Ltd in Hooton, Merseyside (pictured), and 30 staff almost went out of business because of the fraud, which amounted to over £100,000, and was only saved after a family member stepped in . He said: ‘Your job was to protect and advance the financial interests of the company but instead you stole its money. ‘This put the company in real jeopardy until the benevolence of a family member saved it. ‘I accept you co-operated with the police and your former employers and I accept that due to your autism you may feel pressure and stress easily. ‘But that is no different from what a lot of other people feel and you still know right from wrong. ‘The bank statements show you spent most of the money on entertainment and eating out. The main motivation in this case was straight forward greed. ‘You wanted to have an excessive and extravagant lifestyle and put at risk decent, working people’s jobs.’ Clarke was sentenced to two years in prison. Following the sentence, Guy Williams, managing director of F E Robinson Ltd said: ‘It is hoped the sentence passed reflects the gravity of the situation and the fact that as a result of such actions, 30, skilled full time jobs from this company were put in serious jeopardy.’","Andrew Clarke, a finance controller, had submitted a series of false invoices .

Unfortunately she did not go so far as to drive the vehicle, but she did get stuck in in the kitchen, making soup with members of humanitarian aid organisation Malteser. While she was amid the action, David Cameron was beginning his second holiday of the year - in Polzeath, Cornwall. He has been criticised for taking more time off as Britain becomes increasingly involved in the ongoing crisis in Iraq. Mrs Merkel took her annual holiday in April, heading to the same Italian island she has been going to for years - D'Ischia, near Naples, with her husband Jaochim Sauer.

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . A respected Washington think tank has apologised after sending a tweet to human rights group Amnesty International telling them to 'suck it'. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) blamed an intern for the high-profile mishap - which was broadcast to its more than 81,000 followers. The tweet was in reply to one posted by the official Amnesty International profile criticising the United States' human rights record - in reference to the current situation in Ferguson, Missouri. This mishap: CSIS tweeted Amnesty International telling them to 'suck it' to more than 81,000 followers . The apology: CSIS blamed an intern for the tweet, saying he meant to send it from a personal account . Amnesty tweeted: 'US can’t tell other countries to improve their records on policing and peaceful assembly if it won’t clean up its own human rights record,' to which CSIS' account replied: 'Your work has saved far few lives than American interventions. So, suck it.' Andrew Schwartz, senior vice president for external relations at CSIS told BuzzFeed that he was 'embarrassed about this unfortunate situation and the tweet doesn’t reflect anyone’s views at CSIS or the institution as a whole. My colleagues are equally distressed about this.' He has called and emailed Amnesty to apologise directly. CSIS deleted the tweet shortly after it was sent, saying it was posted 'in error', though it was up long enough for many Twitter users to screenshot it. A demonstrator raises his arms before police officers move in to arrest him in Ferguson yesterday . Explaining the incident, Mr Schwartz said: 'Here’s what happened, early this morning, an unconscionable tweet was directed to Amnesty from CSIS’s Twitter account. The tweet in no way reflects CSIS’s views. 'It was sent by a CSIS intern who had access to our account for monitoring purposes. Apparently he meant to send something reflecting his personal views from his personal Twitter account. 'I find his views and the way he expressed them to be abhorrent and will take appropriate action at CSIS to address the matter internally.' He would not comment on whether the intern has been fired. Police officers arrest a demonstrator last night  protesting against Michael Brown's killing in Ferguson . The violent clashes between police and protesters in Ferguson prompted Amnesty International to send a human rights team to work in America for the first time ever. They have criticised the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by officers in the town, where there has been 11 days of unrest after police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. Missouri governor Jay Nixon has pulled the police out of the incident, and replaced them with the National Guard. Police killed a second black man, a 23-year-old who has not yet been named, on Tuesday night in a nearby St Louis neighbourhood, further aggravating the tension. Members of the press have been threatened and arrested as leaders from across the world have come out to criticise the USA's human rights policy.","Washington-based CSIS say intern meant to  tweet from personal account .

"By . Snejana Farberov For Mail online . and David Mccormack for MailOnline . The dramatic heist of nearly $1million in designer bags, jewelry and furs from the 3,000-square-foot closet of a suburban Houston socialite has taken a strange media twist possibly involving a failed ransom plot. A person claiming to be the housebreaker sent several of the stolen items to a weekly newspaper, claiming that they were fake and therefore worthless. The valuables were stolen August 2 from a closet in the palatial home of Theresa Roemer, who uses the room dubbed in the media the ‘she-cave’ for charity fundraisers. Scroll down for videos . Ransom plot: The bracelet and watch were among some 10-15 valuables stolen earlier this month from the home of Theresa Roemer . Personal memento: The loot included this silver heart-shaped locket with a lock of light-brown hair inside that supposedly belonged to Roemer's deceased son . Shakedown: The burglar allegedly asked Roemer to pay up $500,000 to stop him or her from revealing to the media that her valuables were worthless, but the former Miss Texas refused . The alleged burglar also spoke to a reporter with the Houston Press through a voice modulator, making it difficult to tell whether the person is a man or a woman. The suspect called from a disposable cell phone with a New York City area code and claimed he or she was not in Texas. Craig Malisow, the Houston Press reporter, said he first talked to the suspect Tuesday and later received a large brown envelope covered with stamps filled with about 10 to 15 items of jewelry and a man's watch. The loot also included a silver heart-shaped locket with a lock of light-brown hair inside. Ms Roemer had previously told the press that the burglar got away with a necklace containing a strand of hair belonging to her 19-year-old son, Michael, who was killed in a car crash in 2006. ‘It was kind of odd,’ Malisow said, of his conversations with the purported burglar. ‘It sounded like he felt like he was wronged - because when he went to go fence this stuff, he was allegedly told this was fake ... it kind of felt like he was the victim here.’ According to the Houston Press, the burglar had requested more than $500,000 from Roemer to return the stolen items and not tell reporters that they were allegedly cheap knockoffs. Police have released security camera footage showing the thief who robbed former Mrs. Texas United America of nearly $1 million in jewelry, bags, and valuables from her luxurious 'she cave' Surveillance footage recorded a small man dressed entirely in white and wearing gloves in the house, taking four trips to move all the goods outside . ‘The deal never went through. I'm following through with my threat,’ the alleged thief said on the call recorded by the paper. Roemer confirmed to the Houston Chronicle the suspected burglar contacted her August 6, demanding half a million dollars. ‘He tried to hold me ransom for my stuff,’ she said. At first Roemer thought she was the target of a cruel joke, so as a test she asked the caller to send her a photo of her $80,000 raw emerald and diamond ring resting on the front page of the day’s newspaper. Houston Press reporter Craig Malisow spoke to the suspected thief, who called from a disposable cell phone and used a voice modulator . The alleged thief complied with her request, which left the woman ‘freaked out.’ Roemer and authorities believe recent TV and magazine publicity about her three-story dream storeroom filled with treasures attracted the burglar to her mansion in The Woodlands. In surveillance video of the burglary, an intruder, wearing a jump suit and a hoodie, broke in through a bathroom window. The video shows he made four trips over 40 minutes, filling designer luggage with loot. Roemer said she believed that because of the media's coverage, the burglar was unable to pawn the items. ‘He never anticipated my [burglary] going viral - but because the closet went viral, the burglary went viral,’ she said. The glamorous socialite disputed the burglar’s claim that her possessions were fake, but conceded that not all the items in her collection ‘is a million-dollar design.’ ‘It's like any person's closet. You mix and match. In my closet, I have a Donna Karan dress next to one from the Gap,’ Roemer told the site CultureMap. Over the last week Roemer received ‘numerous’ calls from the alleged burglar. ‘This person is just bound and determined to just keep bothering me,’ the blonde former Miss Texas said. Montgomery County Sheriff's Office investigators have retrieved the items sent to the newspaper. Roemer said she used the space to host charity events and that it took her a whole 45 minutes to get ready . ‘We're trying to identify whoever sent these items in,’ said sheriff's office Lt. Brady Fitzgerald. Theresa Roemer said she and her husband were only gone 90 minutes for dinner at a country club just two blocks away, but came home to broken glass and empty shelves. The robbery bears all the markings of being perpetrated by a professional thief. In the video footage, released last Tuesday by police, the burglar is seen wearing a light-colored, hooded jump suit with a baseball cap which helps him blend into the background as he expertly picks through items in Roemer's astonishing three-story, 3,000-square-foot closet. Deputies have determined that the intruder forced his way into the Roemers' home through a bathroom window. Surveillance footage recorded a small . man dressed entirely in white and wearing gloves in the house, taking . four trips to move all the goods outside. The burglary occurred between 7pm and . 11pm on a Friday and the suspect spent almost an hour inside, carrying items back outside. Police have released the video in an attempt to generate leads about the theft, which happened less than two weeks after Roemer's closet had been featured on Good Morning America. Happier times: Theresa Roemer's massive 'she-cave' housed a fortune's worth of expensive handbags, watches, shoes and other baubles . Cleaned out: What's likely a professional thief made off with nearly a million dollar's worth of Roemer's possessions . Roemer told the Houston Chronicle that the video was shot with an infrared camera, because the intruder worked in the dark and never turned on the light. 'That's why it is so unclear and we can't tell the exact color of his clothing,' she said. Roemer has admitted that she and her husband failed to turn on their home's security system before heading out to dinner on August 2. She also didn't lock the glass door to her prized 'she-cave'. 'I don't think anybody can go through life without doing something careless when they're flustered and hurried before leaving,' she told the Chronicle. 'But now I lock all my doors and have lights on, inside and out. The alarm is set, and I'm having more lights and cameras installed.' Roemer said that because she was only away from her home a short while she did not arm the security system . Roemer said she and her husband were only away for 90 minutes to eat dinner at a nearby country club . 'They took everything,' Roemer said. 'They took all my jewelry, all . my watch collections, my husband’s watch collections, my Birkin . collection. They literally walked out with between $800,000 and a . million dollars’ worth of stuff.' The most expensive items taken included 10 Rolex watches, up to a dozen Chanel watches, Cartier watches, and other expensive baubles and accessories. 'I feel violated… raped,' she said. 'To watch someone on film . take everything out of your house that means much to you – it’s just . wrong.' She may have been targeted due to the recent media attention on her  3,000sq ft closet, called her 'she-cave.' Theresa . Roemer, a former Miss Texas United America, enlisted designer Thom . Anderson to add the luxurious three-story space to her Woodlands, Texas, . home, which houses her handbags, shoes and other accoutrements. It cost . roughly $500,000 to build. 'It . started years ago when I had a closet party and all the girls came over . and they said, ""I just wish it was bigger,""' she told the Houston Chronicle, adding: 'Since then it's just been getting bigger and bigger and bigger, it's like a ''she cave.'' It appears the thief gained entrance by using a glass cutter to get into the bathroom . Violated: Roemer has compared the break in to feeling of being 'raped' 'The . third floor houses all my furs and big hats, you come down the spiral . staircase to the second floor which is where I get my hair and make up . done, it also houses all the shoes from Louis Vuitton and Gucci, to my tennis and work out gear,' she said. 'Then . you come down a floating staircase, which is just magical, and the . first floor is where you pick out your jewelry and bags,' she continued, . noting that it typically takes her 45 minutes to get ready. In fact, the closet even features a champagne bar - perfect for hosting events to benefit charitable causes. 'Yes, it’s full of amazing things,' Mrs Roemer she had told Houston’s KHOU, 'but this closet was built and intended for fundraising.' Roemer . has used the hot-ticket space to raise money for causes such as the . American Heart Foundation and Texas Children's Hospital. But it also serves the style needs of those close to Mrs Roemer. The thief target high-end items like Rolex and Cartier watches . 'My daughter always says that she doesn’t need to go to the store; she can just shop my closet!' she told Neiman Marcus's blog. 'And of course I do let a few, very special friends borrow my Birkin bags.' Upon learning her sanctum had been violated, she tried to put things in some perspective. June was the seventh anniversary of her son's death in a car accident in Wyoming. 'I need to count my blessings that no one was hurt or killed,' Roemer said. 'I’ve been through amazingly hard things in life, like burying . my son, and this is not anything compared to that.'","Houston Press was contacted by the alleged burglar saying that Theresa Roemer's stolen valuables were actually worthless .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . It looks like we might have found the future of housing - and that future is in Iran, where architects have designed an incredible seven-storey home with moveable rooms. The Sharifi-Ha house in Tehran is already pretty impressive - it features a gym and a swimming pool, but what makes it extraordinary is how its outer rooms can rotate, creating space and also making it adaptable to the seasons. At just a touch of a button, three of the outer rooms -  the breakfast room, the guest room and the office - can rotate out to overhand the street, letting light in and creating terrace space. Scroll down for video . Twist and shout: The Sharifi-Ha house in Tehran has come up with an ingenious way of creating space - by having rooms which move at the touch of a button . Fancy: The huge, open-plan home is built over seven floors and features large living areas, two kitchens and leisure facilities . Each of the three rooms, which resemble wooden boxes from the outside, is on its own rotating base. During the cold winters they can close up, keeping the house warm, while during the hot summer months, opening them will ventilate the house. The house has two basement floors, which house the gym and other leisure facilities such as a billiards table, the ground floor has room for parking and the housekeeper's living area, the first and second floors are the main living space, with the kitchen, living room and even piano area, while the top two floors have the bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as another kitchen and more living space. It was designed by Iranian architects Nextoffice. A spokesman for the company said: 'The house adapts to the functional needs of its users. Shake it up: The customisable home has two basement floors, one of which houses a gym, while there is also a swimming pool and parking space . Overhang: The breakfast room, guest bedroom and office can rotate 90 degrees, meaning they hang over the street, making up for the house's narrow lot . How it works: This floor plan of the house's outer rooms shows how the rooms rotate to create terrace space and increase ventilation . 'Depending on whether there is a guest or not, the guest room - on the second floor - can be reconfigured for different purposes. 'Similarly home offices and breakfast rooms can change the formality of their appearance according to their residents' desires. 'There is always the possibility of having different seasonal or lighting scenarios because of this style.' The house is inspired by the traditional Iranian home, which has both a summer and winter living room to reflect the stark difference in the seasons' temperatures. Is this the future? Moveable rooms such as these could be important for the future of housing as space becomes limited . The home of design: Iran has three homes up for the 2014 World Architecture Festival Award, including the Sharifi-Ha house . It can reach a sweltering 50C in the summer, while in winter in it regularly well below freezing, so these rotating rooms definitely have a practical use and are not just for showing off. The Sharifi-Ha house has been shortlisted in the house category at the 2014 World Architecture Festival Awards, alongside other impressive entries from the likes of Australia and Malaysia, while Garden House by De Motas Ryan is up for the award in the UK. Iran is no stranger to futuristic homes - two others are also competing for the award, which means only Australia has more nominees, with four.","Sharifi-Ha house is built over seven storeys and has three rooms which can rotate 90 degrees to create space .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . As a lawyer, Clara Vondrich is very used to being in close contact with criminals. But the 36-year-old from Brooklyn went one step further when she took the law into her own hands - chasing a boy who had stolen her iPhone down the street and capturing him - before holding him in a bear hug and waiting for the police. Ms Vondrich had been taking a business call outside a coffee shop on South Third Street, Williamsburg, when the 13-year-old boy approached her, along with two others. Lawyer Clara Vondrich charged down the street after this 13-year-old boy after he stole her phone, before catching him and gripping him in a bear hug until police arrived to arrest him . He shoved her from behind, almost knocking her over, before wrenching her phone from her hand and making off with it. As soon as Ms Vondrich had realised what had happened, she took action. Dressed in wedges and a bright summer dress, she tore down the street after the thief. 'I was all disoriented,' she told the New York Post. 'My headphones almost came off. 'I looked up and I saw him running with my phone. 'I was screaming the whole time, ""Get that kid!""' she said. 'I finally said, ""Yo, I'll give you $200 for that. Just stop"".' Ms Vondrich described the boy as 'pudgy', and was able to catch him even though she was wearing wedges . Hardly dressed for the occasion, Ms Vondrich took the law into her own hands while wearing a summer dress . Not listening, the teenager, who Ms Vondrich described as slow and out-of-shape, handed the phone to his quicker friend, but the lawyer stayed in pursuit of the original thief. The chase ran over five blocks before she finally caught him on South Sixth Street, before wrapping her arms around his chest in a bear grip and forcing him over a car - in the manner of a police offer. She kept him pinned down for two minutes before police arrived to handcuff him and take him to the 90th Precinct station house, where he was to be charged with grand larceny. She had hold of him long enough for dramatic photos to be captured, in which the pair almost look to be posing. 'He was so pudgy and was slowing down, so that’s why I caught up to him,' said Ms Vondrich, who admitted she even felt sorry for the boy. Despite her son being the one in the wrong, the boy's mother was angry with Ms Vondrich for catching and bear hugging him, telling The Post: 'She has her hands all over him. Why is she touching him like that? 'He’s a very good boy, he’s just been hanging out with the wrong crowd. I told him he has to stop hanging out with those boys.' Police were able to track the phone down to a nearby apartment using GPS, but were unable to enter without a search warrant.","Clara Vondrich, 36, was making business call when phone was stolen .

'I will have you know, Madame, I once did an entire show with President Bill Clinton,' Colbert said. 'I hate to break this to you, Stephen, but I've met him, too,' Clinton teased. 'God, you know everyone. What kind of a loser do you have to be to not be included in your book?' Colbert asks, just to find out moments later that he's not in Hard Choices. Through with the name-dropping contest, Colbert says his other problem with Clinton's memoir is that there's no 'real' Hard Choices described in it, 'like which would you rather fight: one horse-sized duck or a hundred duck-sized horses.' Clinton then explains how she'd resolve a duck-horse war, including meeting with Old McDonald, who owns the farm where they both grew up and creating a 'timetable to achieve meaningful horse-duck dialogue.' 'And Stephen, I'm convinced with patience and a strong commitment from our allies - the pigs and the geese - we'd have peace, peace, here, peace peace there, here a peace there a peace everywhere a peace!' Clinton eventually tricked Colbert into telling his audience to buy her book by saying she won't 'appear' on his show without her face being blurred out if he doesn't promote her book. As Clinton appeared on set for her surprise drop in, a 'shocked' Colbert excitedly said, 'Hillary Clinton!' 'Now who's a name-dropper, Stephen?' Clinton said . 'Don't you dare!': 'You were chanting my name four minutes ago, you two-timers,' Colbert said as the audience ecstatically clapped for Clinton and cheered her name . Colbert kicked off the segment by talking about Hillary's potential presidential candidacy, noting that the former first lady-turned senator-turned Secretary of State who is currently self-employed 'is the current frontrunner, which is surprising, since it sounds like she can't hold down a job.' Mocking her star power and a tidbit in the book about Clinton sitting at a piano with Bono, Colbert said: 'Big deal. Bono sit with everybody at the piano. Call me when you're sitting with David Bowie at a didgeridoo,' he added, as a picture of the Australian wind instrument popped up on screen. 'I just don't buy any of this. There is no way on earth one woman can be in so many places at once,' Colbert said as Clinton joined him on the set. As the crowd clapped and chanted, 'Hillary!' The faux news show host told the audience: 'Don't you dare! You were chanting my name four minutes ago, you two-timers.' Clinton, who has not formally announced her candidacy for president in 2016, is in fact the most well-traveled Secretary of State in U.S. history. The former Obama administration official visited 112 countries during her four years in the position, prompting a one journalist to suggest she name her book The Scrunchie Chronicles: 112 Countries And It’s Still All About The Hair, a throwback to both Clinton's travels and her affinity for wearing outdated scrunchies. In the author's note of Hard Choices, Clinton playfully acknowledged the recommendation. 'In the end, the title that best captured my experiences on the high wire of international diplomacy and my thoughts and feelings about what it will take to secure American leadership for the 21st century was Hard Choices,' Clinton wrote.","Clinton sparred off with Colbert in a name-dropping contest and defended the title of her memoir .
'I will have you know, Madame, I once did an entire show with President Bill Clinton,' Colbert told her .
'I hate to break this to you, Stephen, but I've met him, too,' Clinton teased .
Clinton explained how she'd make 'real' hard choices - like how to solve a war between horses and ducks ."
"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . Tamara Ashley was in the middle of a normal phone conversation with her step-mother Kirsty Ashley, chatting about their kids and a trip Kirsty was planning to visit her in Adelaide. Then her step-mum let out a blood-curdling scream. Tamara tried to stay positive, telling herself Kirsty could have just tripped and fallen, but in her gut she knew something was wrong. It was May 15 2012 and Tamara's father Darren Ashley had recently split from Kirsty after 16 years and two children together. She was in the process of taking out a domestic violence order against him. Two weeks earlier, Kirsty, 35, had given Tamara, 27, her mother and brothers' phone numbers just in case anything went wrong. Tamara Ashley, 27, was on the phone to her step-mother and heard her murdered by her father in May 2012 . Darren, 49, had always been manipulative and controlling, but in the six weeks since his split from Kirsty things had gotten worse. 'She'd ring me in the morning and tell me what he'd done day before,' Tamara told Daily Mail Australia from her home in Adelaide. 'There was always something he was doing every day to stop her moving on. 'She lost her job because he'd gone in and accused her of having an affair and her boss didn't want the drama.' There was another incident where he had choked her, which made Kirsty decide to apply for the DVO. On May 14, Kirsty was dropping her and Darren's daughter off at school in Alice Springs when she saw him waiting across the road. Darren Ashley, 49, was sentenced to a minimum of 22 years in prison for the stabbing murder of Kirsty Ashley . Tamara, pictured with Darren, has always known her father was manipulative and controlling, but in the six weeks since his split from Kirsty things had gotten worse . He then tried to cut her car off with his motorbike. When she returned home to her brother's house, where she was staying, he was waiting in the front yard. 'I told her to go straight to the police station, and that night police went to his house to serve the DVO,' Tamara said. The matter was due to be heard in court two days later, but that moment never came. The following day, in the middle of Tamara and Kirsty's two-hour phone conversation, Kirsty noticed her dog Chino had escaped the fence and was wandering around on the street. She thought it was odd, and went outside to get the dog, leaving the door to the house open and unattended. Kirsty came back inside and they continued chatting for another 45 minutes while she checked her Facebook and they discussed the possibility of Kirsty and her daughter visiting Adelaide for a while to get out of Alice Springs and 'clear her head'. Tamara, pictured with Kirsty when she was younger, grew up with her father and step-mother and said she was more like a 'best friend' Then Kirsty screamed and the line went dead. 'You can't describe that scream,' Tamara said. 'I tried to call her back but there was no answer.' Tamara called Kirsty's mother who immediately raced over to the house. 'It was about 25 minutes before I got through to her mum again,' she said. 'She was just screaming saying ""They cut her throat!"" 'Then it's kind of a bit of a blur from there.' Tamara's immediate reaction to her step-mum's murder was that her father couldn't be responsible. 'My subconscious said ""That's my dad, he couldn't do this"",' she said. Weeks before the murder Darren had choked Kirsty, which made her decide to apply for a domestic violence order . 'But when the police called me and asked me questions about where he could be, who were his friends, where did they live - I just knew then.' Darren was charged with Kirsty's murder and two years later he appeared in Alice Springs Supreme Court. In May of this year the court heard Kirsty was stabbed with six different knives, suffering 26 wounds including the slit to her throat. Crown Prosecutor David Morters said some of the knives had the blood of bother Darren and Kirsty on them. In June, Darren was found guilty and was sentenced to a minimum of 22 years in prison. In sentencing, Justice Jenny Blokland said: 'In the face of evidence against you it is very difficult to see how you could possibly have thought you could have fooled investigating police. Darren and Kirsty pictured with their children. The crime has divided the family with many believing Darren is innocent . 'Your attempts to deflect responsibility from yourself were childlike. 'It was a frenzied brutal attack, clearly driven by anger. 'It is a sign of the particularly grotesque violence that towards the end of the attack you drew the knife across the deceased's throat cutting her trachea. 'Despite weeks of evidence that established beyond doubt that you were the perpetrator, you appear to have a distorted view of, or cannot accept the reality of what you have done.' Darren is appealing the guilty verdict. Tamara says the verdict has a caused a rift in her family. Her three full-siblings from her father's marriage to her mother and her half-siblings, who are Darren and Kirsty's children, do not believe he is guilty. Darren was 32 and Kirsty was 19 when they got together. They had two kids of their own . 'It's hard for me in the middle of all this because my siblings all believe he is innocent,' Tamara said. 'According to them I'm an outsider. 'Their son was only 12 when it happened and their daughter was 14. 'It's going to take a while I just have to take a step back and let them accept it.' Tamara says she has struggled to come to terms with the death of Kirsty – who she was closer to than her own mother and father. 'There was only 11 years between me and Kirsty, she was like my best friend rather than my mother,' she said. 'When my mother and father separated I stayed with my dad - I was nine and my mum left all four of us kids with him and I was upset with her so I chose to live with him. 'I look at family photos of us and just see those good times and then just try and override it with what he's done,' Tamara said . 'Then of course Kirsty came on the scene and me and her just had this bond.' Kirsty was a devoted mother and step-mother, a tomboy who loved drag racing and motorbikes and who worked hard running her own commercial cleaning business. Every now and then Tamara's subconscious kicks in telling her her father couldn't have killed her step-mum. 'I look at family photos of us and just see those good times and then just try and override it with what he's done,' she said. 'The facts and evidence I know and I've seen just overrides it. 'Basically he's just divided the family in half, he's making us pay for his mistake.'","Tamara Ashley's father was found guilty of murdering her step-mother .

"By . Corey Charlton . Labour's shadow health minister Jamie Reed said the NHS was going 'downhill' under David Cameron's watch . Hundreds of thousands of patients in need of emergency care are being left at the doors of A&E in ambulances because hospitals are too full, Labour has said. New figures obtained by the party show that last year almost 300,000 patients in England were caught in queues of ambulances outside emergency departments. In 2013/14, 279,207 ambulances were delayed for more than 30 minutes and a further 30,601 faced waits longer than one hour, a Labour said. Freedom of Information requests conducted on all 10 ambulance trusts in England also revealed that some patients were forced to wait in these queues for hours on end. A patient in the West Midlands was forced to wait for eight hours and 11 minutes, the party found. Another in the South West waited for seven and a half hours. Labour said that the 'handover delays' occur when ambulance crews cannot transfer a patient to the A&E department because of staff or bed shortages. Labour's shadow health minister Jamie Reed said: 'Under David Cameron, hospitals are full to bursting and he's forcing ambulances to queue at the doors for hours on end. 'Thousands of vulnerable people, many of them elderly and frightened, are being wrongly held in the backs of ambulances because hospitals don't have the space. And yet ministers deny that A&E is in crisis. 'People know from their own experience that the NHS is heading downhill on David Cameron's watch. It is clear the Tories can't be trusted with it.' A Department of Health spokesman said: 'People rely on ambulances coming quickly in life and death situations and long handovers are completely unacceptable. 'We're already making good progress in reducing the number of patients waiting for 30 minutes or longer - down by almost a third last winter - though there's always more the NHS can do. 'We are providing extra support, including £28 million for ambulances from funds already given to the NHS this year, to keep services sustainable year-round. In the long-term, we want to reduce demand by looking after people better in the community.' Labour claimed the 'handover delays' occurred when staff couldn't transfer the patient because of A&E bed shortages. Stock picture used . An NHS England spokeswoman said: 'The figures published for the winter of 2013/14 show that the number of ambulance handover delays were actually down on the previous year by 30%. 'We know that demands on ambulances are rising every year, and we're allocating a further £28 million to ambulance providers to help them deal with these pressures. 'However in some cases it may be the right thing to do for a patient to be cared for in the ambulance before transfer to stabilise their condition. 'One of the aims of our Urgent and Emergency Care Review is to capitalise on the skills and abilities of paramedics and the wider workforce so that ambulances can become more of a mobile treatment service, rather than just a transport service.'","Hundreds of thousands of patients forced to wait at the doors of A&E .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . A powerful memorial aimed at the killers of a 22-year-old man who was stabbed after refusing to give up his skateboard has appeared in Echo Park, Los Angeles, near the scene of the crime. Carlos Arellano was walking with his girlfriend on Sunset Boulevard when he was attacked by three people. The couple were near Laveta Terrace when one of the suspects punched him in the jaw. Mr Arellano swung his skateboard in self-defence before being stabbed in the stomach and collapsing to the ground as his girlfriend screamed. 'Here's your f****** skateboard': The scathing message written to Carlos Arellano's killers in Echo Park . A witness, who recognised the couple as regulars at his store, told The Eastsider: 'He got shanked and fell to the floor.' Mr Arellano was taken to hospital, but died from his injuries. A skateboard has been taped to a lamp post near to where the attack took place as a memorial to Mr Arellano, with a massage attached that also attacks his killers. The 1500 block of West Sunset Boulevard, Los Angles, where Carlos Arellano was fatally stabbed . It reads: 'Did they kill him for a skateboard? Or just for fun? Here's your f***ing skateboard.

If anyone knows something, please come forward.' Los Angeles Police Officer Nuria Vanegas  said the attack took place at about 11.30pm last Friday, in the 1500 block of West Sunset Boulevard. After stabbing Mr Arellano, the suspects fled north on Echo Park Avenue, and remain at large. Gang detectives are investigating the incident, though there is currently no clear evidence that links it to gang activity.

"By . Daily Mail Repoter . A bus driver in Canada had a 'soul-touching' moment on Saturday when he watched as one selfless passenger gave his shoes and socks to a perfect stranger whose only footwear was a couple of plastic hairnets. Bus driver Surjit Singh Virk - a 16-year veteran driver for the Coast Mountain Bus Co. in Vancouver - was off duty and returning from the Surrey B.C.’s Vaisakhi parade when he witnessed the random act of kindness. Singh Virk managed to snap a few photos of the exchange and shared them on social media. The man on the right noticed that the man on the left had no shoes when he saw him on a bus in Canada. So he gave him the shoes he was wearing and walked home barefoot . 'It made my heart melt,' he told QMI Agency, a Canadian media company. 'He just took his shoes and . socks off and said, ""You can take these, don't worry about me — I live . close by and can walk."" 'People usually don't care or even look . at other people on the bus, they didn't even want to sit beside this guy . because of how he was dressed.' The kind-hearted man who selflessly handed over his shoes to his less-fortunate fellow passenger was reached by phone, but asked the news outlet to not identify him by name because his Islamic faith requires that charitable acts be done anonymously. According to QMI, the man also was reluctant about allowing the use of his photo, but ultimately agreed. 'I felt bad for the guy,' the generous 27-year-old Surrey resident said. 'He was . wearing plastic hairnets on his feet. I was only about a two-minute walk . from home, so I thought I could give him my shoes.' Humble: The generous man does not want to be identified because his Muslim faith teaches that all acts of charity should be done anonymously . The anonymous Good Samaritan was coming from a nearby mosque when he noticed the man in need. Mufti Aasim Rashid, the spokesman for the B.C. Muslim Association - which runs the mosque where the man had been - told QMI that the selfless act would qualify as a general act of charity - a 'sadaqa.' 'Whenever we do a good deed, even if it's to help someone out, the . Islamic teachings maintain this should remain only for the pleasure of . God,' Rashid said. 'It's nice to see people practicing the teachings ... it . looks like he's really benefited.' Singh Virk says he spoke with the recipient of the shoes after the Good Samaritan had gotten off the bus. He says the man was 'shocked.' 'Boots': NYPD Detective Larry DePrimo was the face of charity after this image of him buying a homeless man a pair of boots went viral . 'What a nice guy... Did that really happen?” Singh Virk quoted the man as saying. The touching scene was reminiscent of NYPD Officer Larry DePrimo, who was famously photographed in November of 2012 as he bought a shoeless homeless man a pair of boots and heavy socks on a frigid day in New York City, and even helped him put them on. About a year later, DePrimo was promoted to detective. At the time, some of his new colleagues on the detective squad got him a special nameplate for his new desk: 'Larry (Boots) DePrimo.'","The generous man did not want to be identified because his Muslim faith teaches that acts of charity are to be done anonymously .

"By . Francesca Chambers . The White House refused to comply today with a subpoena issued by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee demanding that the president's official political adviser testify before Congress. The president's Director of the Office of Political Strategy & Outreach, David Simas, was scheduled to appear before the Oversight committee today to state for the record that his work does not violate a federal law that bans most executive branch employees from engaging in political activity. But White House Counsel W. Neil Eggleston sent a letter to the committee last night saying Congress doesn't have the authority to require the president's chief advisers to give testimony. House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa opted to allow the hearing to start today without Simas, arguing in his opening statement that the committee has a 'legal obligation' to make sure that taxpayer dollars are not being spent on illegal activity. The White House says that the president's official political adviser David Simas, pictured here to the right of President Barack Obama in 2010, is immune from congressional subpenas . The White House's Office of Political Affairs has been under scrutiny since Democrats controlled Congress and Republicans controlled the White House during the tenure of George W. Bush. President Barack Obama kept the office open through the 2010 midterm congressional elections but closed it shortly afterward amid concerns that the office's work involved partisan political activity. Earlier this year the White House reopened the office ahead of the upcoming midterm elections under a slightly different name, raising anew suspicions among Republican legislators that the office may be engaging in activity that violates federal law. A 1939 law called the Hatch Act bars executive branch employees, excluding the president, vice president and a handful of other officials, from conducting political activity on federal property and from soliciting political contributions. So far, Obama's chief political adviser hasn't done anything to incite a congressional investigation into his work other than holding the political affairs position. However, Issa said today that his committee does 'not and should not need a smoking gun' to look into whether taxpayer dollars are being spent improperly. Given that the committee's 'most key witness' in today's hearing 'has chosen to defy the committee's legal obligation and its subpoena,' the Republican lawmaker announced that he would recess the hearing until a future date after opening statements. Issa could be waiting indefinitely for the hearing to restart if its predicated on Simas testifying. In the letter informing the Oversight committee of Mr. Simas' intentions not to appear before the committee in an official capacity, White House Counsel cited a legal opinion from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel stating that 'the President’s immediate advisers are absolutely immune from the congressional testimonial process.' 'This immunity is rooted in the constitutional separation of powers, and in the immunity of the President himself from congressional compulsion to testify,' the letter said, quoiting the Office of Legal Counsel. In his remarks at this morning's hearing, Issa dismissed the Justice Department's opinion, claiming 'it is at odds with rulings from our judicial branch about checks and balances.' Issa said his committee has had 'patience for months, and gave the White House extensive opportunities to explain concerns' through briefings and documents. Mr. Simas' failure to show up to today's hearing makes the claim that the White House is doing 'everything right indefensible,' he said a few minutes later. Prior to today, White House Counsel offered to sit down with Issa and answer questions about the reopening of the political office outside a congressional hearing if Issa withdrew his subpoena . 'While I am hopeful that we can work together constructively to . address your stated interests, your subpoena is not helpful to these . efforts,' Eggleston told Issa in a letter on Monday. 'As you know, it has been the view of administrations from both . political parties that summoning the President’s most senior advisors to . provide public testimony raises significant separation of power . concerns.' House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, right, and ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummings, left, are pictured here in March at an Oversight hearing having a fiery disagreement over the way Issa runs the committee. Cummings lambasted Issa again during a hearing today, saying he was undermining the committee by unilaterally issuing subpoenas . A Democrat with knowledge of the situation told Roll Call that Issa sent nine staffers to the White House yesterday who asked 45 questions over the course of an hour and fifteen minute meeting, and the sit down only concluded when Republicans had finished making inquiries. Issa didn't attend the meeting, however, the source said. 'Guess who didn’t even bother to show-up? One guess. Correct, no Issa.' But Simas didn't attend the meeting, either, prompting Issa to send Eggleston a letter yesterday afternoon restating his request for Simas to appear before the Oversight committee today. 'The Committee has outstanding questions for Mr. Simas, who did not take part in the briefing, and it is necessary for him to appear at tomorrow’s hearing,' Issa stated. 'I believe his on-the-record testimony will provide valuable insight into White House efforts to ensure appropriate use of taxpayer funds.' The ranking Democrat on the Oversight committee, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, said in a statement yesterday that the White House briefing ought to have been enough for his Republican colleague, however. 'There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that Mr. Simas or anyone . on his staff did anything wrong,' he said, calling the White House briefing 'detailed and . thorough.' 'There seems to be no reason to continue this ridiculous . confrontation other than to manufacture false controversy as Chairman . Issa’s tenure comes to an end,' he charged. At today's hearing Cumming lit into Issa again, saying he 'strongly' supports the committee's authority to issue subpoenas 'when necessary,' but this is not one of those instances. Witch hunts like the one Issa is undertaking 'undermines' and 'degrades' the Oversight committee, he said, and 'makes us weaker.' Cummings repeated a previous complaint that Issa has handed out nearly 100 subpoenas since taking over the chairmanship in 2011, which is more than the combined total of the last three chairs. 'This is not about me. This is not about this committee This is about generations unborn,' he argued, urging Issa to 'change course.' 'When I raised concerns you did not take them seriously,' he said, referencing a letter he wrote to Issa on Friday asking him to take a committee vote before issuing a subpoena to Mr. Simas. 'You did not ask other members if you were nuts or if you were wrong.' 'I end by saying we are better,' Cummings said at the conclusion of his remarks. 'If we want to go far, let's go together. If we want to go fast, let's go alone.' At a briefing with reporters this afternoon White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest piled on, assailing Issa for 'throwing out subpoenas like candy on Halloween.' The White House spokesman said it's causing people to 'tune him out.'","House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa subpenaed the president's official political adviser, David Simas .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has hired a top military justice lawyer to represent him as the investigation into his 2009 capture by the Taliban continues. Yale Law School professor Eugene Fidell starting working on the former Taliban POW's case on a pro bono basis a week ago at Bergdahl's request. 'I think it's important that people, particularly people who have been vilified, have proper representation, and every lawyer has a responsibility to represent even unpopular clients and that's why I'm involved in this,' Fidell told ABC News. Bergdahl, who returned to active duty this week, also has an Army lawyer representing him. The two lawyers will work together, Fidell said. Lawyer: Sgt.

Expert: Yale Law School professor Eugene Fidell, pictured, starting working on the former Taliban POW's case on a pro bono basis a week ago at Bergdahl's request . Fidell met with Bergdahl last week, but wouldn't comment to ABC on his condition. He also refused to say whether he had been in contact with Bergdahl's parents, whom the former POW has declined to speak to since his return, according to defense officials. Fidell said Major General Kenneth Dahl, who is heading the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's disappearance from his outpost in Afghanistan, had not yet interviewed his client. He said he didn't expect Dahl to have any substantive interviews with Bergdahl for a couple of weeks. He added that he will be present for the interviews. Bergdahl has not been charged with any crimes. It emerged yesterday that Bergdahl has refused contact with his parents in the four weeks since his release. The Wall Street Journal has reported Sgt Bergdahl - who started a desk job at the army headquarters on Monday as part of his return to duty - has chosen not to see or speak to his parents . The family have not commented on the situation, and the cause of the tension is not known. Following the controversial decision to trade Sgt. Bergdahl for five Guantanamo Bay detainees, his parents, Bob and Jani Bergdahl, appeared at a White House announcement alongside President Barack Obama. Accompanied by President Barack Obama, Jani . Bergdahl and Bob Bergdahl speak during a news conference in the Rose . Garden of the White House in Washington on Saturday, May 31, 2014 about . the release of their son. It has now been revealed they have not spoken to Bowe Bergdahl since his release . In a statement, the Army said that the soldier 'has completed the final phase of the reintegration process under the control of U.S. Army South and is currently being assigned to U.S. Army North, Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston (JBSA).' 'He will now return to regular duty within the command where he can contribute to the mission. The Army investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the disappearance and capture of Bergdahl is still ongoing.' According to the New York Times, Bergdahl was in therapy at Fort Sam Houston and will meet with Major General Kenneth R. Dahl, the head of the Army's investigation. Since his return from Afghanistan, Sgt. Bergdahl has been involved in debriefings with his superiors, the paper said. Just last week, a photo of Bergdahl, . smiling and posing with a former senior Taliban official in Afghanistan . was posted on Twitter. The undated . photo, likely taken during Bergdahl’s five years in captivity, was . posted on the social media site on Wednesday by @khorasan3, an account . associated with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

Bowe Bergdahl, smiling and posing with Taliban Commander Badruddin Haqqani, a senior member of the Haqqani network in Afghanistan, was posted on Twitter on Wednesday . The . estrangement comes after it was revealed Bergdahl may also receive . $350,000 from the US government without paying taxes: $200,000 would be . for wages earned during his captivity and $150,000 if he in fact was a . prisoner of war, according to Fox News. Money earned while in a combat zone is excluded, per IRS regulations. Bergdahl will also have a sponsor as he returns to work as a 'normal soldier' with a desk job. The . sponsor is described as 'a person who's designated, not only for him, . but for every soldier in Army North [...] and assists with assimilating . into the unit.' The . sponsor helps with 'very basic administrative functions,'  such . '[helping become] a part of the unit, processing records, becoming . familiar with the day to day schedule.' The .

Former POW Bergdahl was controversially released by the Taliban in May in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay detainees. Last . week it emerged that Bergdahl is being allowed to wander off the Texas base . and while under supervision he has visited a library, a supermarket, . stores and fast-food chains near the camp.

The . details have emerged as soldiers who served with Bergdahl before he . left his post in Afghanistan in 2009 revealed to Fox News they have still not been . contacted by military investigators. The former . soldiers told the news channel they believe the Army has already made up its mind about how Bergdahl ended up in . the hands of the Taliban - and that they believe he deserted his post. But when he was swapped for five Guantanamo Bay detainees on May 31, President Obama gave him a hero's welcome and said the switch had been prompted by Bergdahl's poor health. 'I think it's very clear he . deserted his post,' Army Sgt. Evan Buetow told FoxNews.com. 'He thought about what he . was doing, he mailed some things home, he walked away and we have . witnesses who saw him walking away.

The Doers Network say there is no hidden agenda, no mailing list and no religious message - they thrive off the buzz of putting a smile on someone's face. Led by 23-year-old Jesse Speer, members of the not-for-profit organisation, are bringing their random acts of kindness to the UK, expanding from their New York base. Since its creation, the network has raised thousands of dollars in donations, and attracting intrigue and new members across America. But UK domination is just the tip of the iceberg, with the network aiming to open branches all across the world . Mr Speer, who hails from Williamsburg in Brooklyn, said: 'I don't want it to be a charity, I just want to invoke a sense of kindness. 'Kindness has nothing to do with money - who's doing stuff for the people who have money but might be unhappy? 'Our tag line is it doesn't matter if you live on the street or if you own it, we have something for you.' But he said, in spite of the positive, feel-good factor they promote, members of the group routinely face rejection from the public, who turn down the offer of free money or food, assuming it is too good to be true. Members tour the subway in New York, quizzing passengers, challenging them with questions including, 'What colour is the sky?' in return for cash prizes .

The network is planning to expand its kind-hearted gestures, starting a branch in the UK . But rather than discourage the do-gooders, who dress in branded Doers Network t-shirts, it is that skepticism that fuels their determination. Mr Speer added: 'The point where I'll say I'm happy will be when the entire world knows who we are and what we do, and recognises our logo.

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . The Granite City of Aberdeen has been identified as a stronghold for a deadly Italian crime syndicate, a new European Union report has found. The Camorra group, based in Naples, is made up of family networks and is said to have killed more people than any other crime organisation in Europe. But, according to the new study, the violent Mafia-style gang has spread further afield, and now 'controls' catering, food retail and property in Scotland's third most populous city. The Transcrime research centre found evidence that Camorra and two other gangs, the 'Ndrangheta and the Sicilian Mafia, have operations in the UK. The gang now 'controls' catering, food retail and property in Aberdeen, according to a new EU study . Police on the street, the impact of La Camorra crime gangs in Naples, Italy . The project, which was funded by the EU, analyses how the main organised criminal groups invested the proceeds of their crimes in selected countries between 2007 and 2013. It states: 'The Camorra stronghold is Aberdeen, the third most populous city in Scotland, where it controls the catering, public works, food retail and wholesale and property sectors.' The report adds: 'The Sicilian Mafia runs illegal gambling dens in London. The 'Ndrangheta also has a presence in London, in the property sector.' Aberdeen has been linked repeatedly with Mafia activity over the past decade. City restaurateur Antonio La Torre - named by Italian prosecutors as a Camorra crime lord - was arrested in 2005 and jailed in Italy for extortion and racketeering. He is the brother of Augusto La Torre, who later confessed to murdering 40 people in Italy. Former Aberdeen restaurateur Michele Siciliano, who is said to have looked after La Torre's finances following his extradition, also gave himself up to anti-Mafia prosecutors the following year. The Camorra group, based in Naples, is made up of family networks. Here Italian  boss, Francesco Schiavone, is arrested by Italian police in Caserta in 1998 . Residents look at an Italian forensic police officer inspecting the body of alleged mobster Pasquale Russo, who was killed at the restart of a bloody Camorra war . Another city restaurant boss, Ciro Schiattarella, spent time in jail after being extradited to Italy to face charges. Former Aberdeen City Council leader Barney Crockett said the Mafia's presence in Aberdeen was no secret. He said: 'I think the attraction of Aberdeen is the fact that they can swap over a lot of money, because it is such a busy business environment. 'However, I am totally confident that there is no involvement in public works of any description.' Members of Aberdeen's 600-strong Italian community have denied the city is in the grip of gangsters. But Italian MEP Oreste Rossi is using the new report to push for fresh crime prevention 'tools' to combat Mafia money-laundering across Europe. Last night, former MEP Struan Stevenson, said the claims in the report were 'absolutely staggering'. He said: 'It is well known that criminal gangs in Scotland use legitimate business operations to turn their dirty money into clean money. 'But these have always been home-grown gangs, usually from Glasgow, where money has been known to go into things like taxi companies and construction firms. 'It is absolutely staggering - but probably shouldn't come as a surprise - that the Camorra has twigged that places like Aberdeen are potential havens for them to launder money. 'Scottish police need to get to the bottom of whether the findings of this report are true - and if it is, there needs to be unilateral action to stamp it out. 'New European laws to back this up would be helpful.' The first seeds of the Cammora's deadly power took root in Aberdeen in the late 18th Century. Italian commentators say its strength reached its peak in modern times. The only record of alleged clan activity in the UK was perpetrated by the La Torres in Aberdeen. The Transcrime report also identifies Mafia operations in Romania, Spain, Portugal and France in industries such as catering, property, transport and farming. European Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmstrom said the report was being analysed by Brussels officials and would influence new legislation being drawn up. Police Scotland declined to comment on the report.","The violent Mafia-style set of family network is based in Naples .

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . and Sarah Dean for Daily Mail Australia . People are being urged not to overact after the Northern Territory’s third fatal crocodile attack this year - as the government considers crocodile culling, safari hunting and a renewed safety campaign. Following the shooting of popular albino-headed crocodile Michael Jackson after it killed a fisherman, Chief Minister Adam Giles said the incident proved it was 'a sign that the density and population of crocs in the NT is becoming somewhat of an issue'. ‘We don't want to see a knee-jerk reaction,’ he said adding the cabinet would consider culling as a long-term policy as well as safari hunting. ‘It's not about going out and randomly killing crocs, it's about having a well-developed plan that protects the interests of the animal but also the interests of the general public,’ Mr Giles said. Scroll down for video . Half-albino crocodile 'Michael Jackson', who killed a 57-year-old fisherman on Adelaide river, was shot as a result of the attack . The 57-year-old man, named last night Tran Van Lanh, as was attacked and killed by the crocodile in front of his wife while they were fishing at the Adelaide River on Monday afternoon about 60km east of Darwin. The unusual crocodile, that was shot and killed, was 'one in a million', a tour operator said. The Vietnamese farmer was taken when he got into the water to unsnag his fishing line. Police and rangers scouring the crocodile-infested river by boat on Monday night shot and killed a 4.5m crocodile around 9.30pm and the man's body was recovered later that night. His wife was treated by paramedics at the scene for shock. Charles Darwin University crocodile researcher Adam Britton said although it was an obvious shame that the well-loved crocodile had to be shot - it was the appropriate action to take. He said albinism is 'incredibly rare' in crocodiles, and Michael Jackson was a main attraction for tourists on the numerous Jumping Croc cruises based along the river, where boats travel the river dangling meat attached from hooks for crocodiles to jump up and snatch. 'It was always a thrill when he appeared,' Dr Britton said. The third fatal crocodile attack this year in the ACT has prompted the government to consider crocodile culling, safari hunting and a renewed safety campaign . The man was standing on the bank of the river east of Darwin trying to retrieve a fishing hook when he was taken by the crocodile. Signs near where the man was attacked show warnings about fishing near crocodiles . Dr Britton said territorians are becoming complacent, and deaths are not the way people should be reminded about crocodile safety. 'This man almost certainly would have known there were crocodiles in the river, and he probably even knew the croc that took him,' he said. 'For a fleeting a moment, he should have thought about that; he took a little risk and that was enough.' The Adelaide River is well known for its Jumping Croc tours, where boats travel the river and crocodiles jump for meat attached to hooks. 'Michael Jackson was one in a million, and unfortunately being an albino would have been picked on by all the others, its a big pecking order,' said Rob Marchand, owner of Wallaroo Tours, which runs Jumping Croc cruises across the river from where the man was taken. He told the ABC on Tuesday that the crocodile had been in that part of the river for several years, and that the crocodiles had been fighting a lot recently, jockeying for position and preparing to breed. The Adelaide River is well known for its Jumping Croc tours, where boats travel the river and crocodiles jump for meat attached to hooks. Rob Marchand, owner of Wallaroo Tours, which runs Jumping Croc cruises across the river from where the man was taken told the ABC on Tuesday that the crocodile had been in that part of the river for several years . He said only the strongest and most aggressive crocodiles reached four metres or longer. 'The croc has only been doing what nature intends it to do, and that's survive,' Mr Marchand said. 'They know how to do three major things: eat, reproduce and aggression ... if you're not going to look after yourself, you'll find yourself being eaten.' Crocodiles shouldn't be blamed for their natural behaviour, he said, and rejected the suggestion that the Jumping Croc tours were encouraging predatory behaviour on the Adelaide River. 'I'm sure crocs knew how to eat people a long time before we come along,' he said. The attack is the third this year, after a boy was taken at a billabong at Jabiru in January, and another fisherman was snatched off his boat as he emptied a bucket in a Kakadu River two months ago. A crocodile was also shot on the Tiwi Islands two weeks ago, suspected to have killed a local man who disappeared and has yet to be found. But tests on the organic matter found in its stomach haven't yet produced a conclusive result. The man in his 50s was standing on the side of the river near the  Adelaide River bridge, east of Darwin .","Man, 57, was snatched from the side of Adelaide River, east of Darwin .

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . A French MEP and former minister has created a storm in France by posting a picture of a veiled woman sitting on a beach and criticising it as an 'attack on our culture'. Nadine Morano, a close ally of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, took a picture of the woman wearing a headscarf and posted it on her Twitter feed and Facebook page next to a famous photo of sex symbol Brigitte Bardot wearing a bikini. 'When one sees this scene, one cannot but help feel an attack on our culture that goes against our sexual equality,' wrote Morano, from the centre-right UMP party. Scroll down for video . Nadine Morano sparked a heated debate in France by posting a picture of a veiled woman sitting on a beach and criticising it as an 'attack on our culture' 'If you choose to come to France, a state of law, a secular state, one should respect our culture and women's rights. If not, go elsewhere!' said Morano, who is well-known for gaffes and outspoken comments. She acknowledged, however, that the woman had not broken the law, which bans women from wearing a full-face veil. The comments touched off a heated debate in France, home to Europe's largest Muslim community. Abdallah Zekri, president of the National Observatory Against Islamophobia hit back, stressing that 'freedom of expression and belief are constitutional rights'. Morano retorted that France needed a 'national observatory for respecting French culture'. 'French culture is equality between men and women,' she stressed. The debate raged on social networks and between politicians. Jean-Marc Germain, from the ruling Socialists, attacked Morano as representing 'the worst of the right-wing ... who rejects others, who believes that you are not a proper French person if you are Muslim'. Valerie Pecresse, from the same UMP party as Morano, reacted by saying: 'You can walk around wearing whatever you like on the beach.' And the deputy president of the far-right National Front, Florian Philippot, repeated his party's call for a ban on 'overt religious symbols' in public. France's Secretary of State for European Affairs, Harlem Desir, said he 'understood' Morano's comments, but called for the law to be upheld.","Nadine Morano took a picture of the woman and posted it on Twitter .

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . When it comes to adding up it's experience that counts, scientists have found. Research carried out on elementary school-age children has revealed that drilling children on simple addition and multiplication may pay off. According to the results, as children's brains develop remembering sums helps them add up faster. 'Experience really does matter,' said Dr Kathy Mann Koepke of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the research. Third grade teacher Melissa Grieshober teaches a math lesson at Silver Lake Elementary School in Middletown, Delaware . Healthy children start making that switch between counting to what's called fact retrieval when they're eight to nine-years-old, when they're still working on fundamental addition and subtraction. How well children make that shift to memory-based problem-solving is known to predict their ultimate math achievement. Those who fall behind 'are impairing or slowing down their math learning later on,' Mann Koepke said. But why do some children make the transition easier than others? To start finding out, Stanford University researchers first peeked into the brains of 28 children as they solved a series of simple addition problems inside a brain-scanning MRI machine. No scribbling out the answer: The seven to nine-year-olds saw a calculation — three plus four equals seven, for example — flash on a screen and pushed a button to say if the answer was right or wrong. Scientists recorded how quickly they responded and what regions of their brain became active as they did. In a separate session, they also tested the children face-to-face, watching if they moved their lips or counted on their fingers, for comparison with the brain data. The children were tested twice, roughly a year apart. As the children got older, their answers relied more on memory and became faster and more accurate, and it showed in the brain. Stanford University researchers studied elementary school-age children by setting them tasks inside a brain-scanning MRI machine (file picture) There was less activity in the prefrontal and parietal regions associated with counting and more in the brain's memory center, the hippocampus, the researchers reported in Nature Neuroscience. The hippocampus is sort of like a relay station where new memories come in — short-term working memory — and then can be sent elsewhere for longer-term storage and retrieval. Those hippocampal connections increased with the kids' math performance. 'The stronger the connections, the greater each individual's ability to retrieve facts from memory,' said Dr Vinod Menon, a psychiatry professor at Stanford and the study's senior author. But that's not the whole story. Next, Menon's team put 20 adolescents and 20 adults into the MRI machines and gave them the same simple addition problems. It turns out that adults don't use their memory-crunching hippocampus in the same way. Instead of using a lot of effort, retrieving six plus four equals 10 from long-term storage was almost automatic, Menon said. In other words, over time the brain became increasingly efficient at retrieving facts. Think of it like a bumpy, grassy field, NIH's Mann Koepke explained. Walk over the same spot enough and a smooth, grass-free path forms, making it easier to get from start to end. If your brain doesn't have to work as hard on simple maths, it has more working memory free to process the teacher's brand-new lesson on more complex math. 'The study provides new evidence that this experience with math actually changes the hippocampal patterns, or the connections. They become more stable with skill development,' she said. 'So learning your addition and multiplication tables and having them in rote memory helps.' Quiz your child in different orders, she advised — nine times three and then 10 times nine — to make sure they really remember and didn't have to think it through. While the study focuses on math, Mann Koepke said cognitive development in general probably works the same way. After all, kids who match sounds to letters earlier learn to read faster. Stanford's Menon said the next step is to study what goes wrong with this system in children with math learning disabilities, so that scientists might try new strategies to help them learn.","Stanford University researchers studied elementary school-age children .

'Good on Thorpey for coming out as gay. Although if he really wanted to shock people he should've said that he was straight. #IanThorpe,' he posted on Sunday night. Other Twitters users including TV and radio personalities slammed Hildebrand for his comment, calling it 'crude' and 'unkind'.

Joe Hildebrand, pictured left, sparked a Twitter backlash after posting tweets considered offensive towards former Olympian Ian Thorpe, pictured right, during his coming out interview which aired on Sunday night . 'If Joe Hildebrand really wanted to shock people he should have failed to act like a nauseating cretin,' Bernard Keane posted. As the backlash started to mount on Twitter, Hildebrand tried to redeem himself by offering an apology for earlier his Tweet. 'In all seriousness, Ian Thorpe coming out might actually be the biggest breakthrough for gay acceptance Australia has ever seen,' he posted. More than an hour later the Studio 10 and Triple M presenter and News Corp columnist offered another 'apology': 'I am so sorry that apparently everyone on Twitter didn't know Thorpey was gay. Best wishes to your home planet.' He then followed this with a tweet about 'groundbreaking' MasterChef news. After his initial tweet, the TV personality backtracked calling Thorpe's coming out a 'breakthrough' A series of apologies followed, although people on Twitter found these equally offensive . As the backlash developed, Hildebrand became embroiled in a stoush with Triple J radio weekend breakfast host Kyran Wheatley. 'He JUST said it was this sort of expectation that prevented him from coming out. How f*****g stupid are you?' Wheatley tweeted. Hildebrand responded with: '@kyranwheatley I refuse to be called ""stupid"" by anyone called ""Kyran"".' SBS TV personality Marc Fennell weighed at this point: '@Joe_Hildebrand @kyranwheatley making fun of someone's name? C'mon mate, you're smarter & better than that.'

England batsman Ian bell led the tributes after Warwickshire club captain Jim Troughton announced his retirement from professional cricket with immediate effect after failing to overcome a long-standing back injury. Troughton has only been able to represent Warwickshire sporadically in the last couple of seasons and made what would turn out to be his final appearance for the county in the LV= County Championship Division One defeat by Yorkshire in June. And his county colleague Bell tweeted: 'Devastated my mate and bro in law Troughts has had to retire. Huge loss to all concerned on and off the field!' Calling it a day: Jim Troughton (right) has announced his retirement from cricket because of a back injury . Leader: Troughton directing operations earlier this summer  (left) and kissing the Championship trophy in 2012 . Chris Woakes added: Sad to see Jim Troughton retire today. A true Bear who will be missed on & off the pitch. Great player, great career but even better bloke!' He scored 8,491 runs in 167 first-class matches and was named captain ahead of the 2011 season, with arguably his finest moment in the game coming the following year when he led Warwickshire to the Division One title. 'After what has been a difficult 14 months dealing with back problems, I am devastated to have to concede that my playing days are over,' Troughton - the grandson of former Doctor Who star Patrick Troughton - said. 'I simply am no longer able to do myself justice and after much deliberation and consultation with the club's medical team, my surgeon, family and close friends, I have to accept that I can no longer train and perform to the level required to fulfil my duties as a first-class cricketer and club captain.

The 35-year-old made six one-day international appearances for England in 2003 although a top-score of 20 in five innings meant he was not considered again. Dougie Brown, director of cricket at Warwickshire, said: 'Jim has been a model professional, having won multiple trophies, leading the club to a County Championship title and setting outstanding standards, on and off the field, for young cricketers to follow. 'Whilst we're very sad that he has to retire in this way, all members of the playing and coaching team are very proud at what he has achieved in the professional game. 'It has been a pleasure to work and play alongside him and as a Championship-winning skipper he will always have a special place in the history of the club.'

The version by Joey Boyes, 27, of Saltburn-by-the-Sea, North Yorkshire, was written for his best friend Dominic Clark's wedding to Rebecca. The remake - titled Best Man Joe - is the result of six months of writing, learning and annoying his friends and family with constant practising. Lines from the song included: ‘After years of dating mingers, he's finally found a queen. 'Best man Joe, says hello, to the couple with the brightest spark. Best man Joe, says hello, to the brand new Mrs Clark.’ Mr Boyes said afterwards: ‘I've known Dom all my life and I wanted to do something special. We both did theatre when we were younger and Becky loves Disney so this seemed perfect. ‘It went down much better than I expected.

"By . Cindy Garcia-bennett, Press Association . Italy's early elimination from the World Cup has strengthened the belief that football in the country desperately needs a new direction. Eight years on from their glorious victory in Germany, the Azzurri have now suffered back-to-back first-round exits in the competition for the first time since the 1950s. Serie A has also lost some of its lustre, with the last Italian club to lift the Champions League trophy being Inter Milan in 2010. Questions: Italian football has been rocked by the team's World Cup exit and Prandelli's resignation . Shock: The Italians were knocked out after losing to Costa Rica and Uruguay in Group D . 'We have to ask ourselves why we have gone out twice in the first round of a World Cup,' Italian Football Federation vice-president Demetrio Albertini said. 'In the 1990s we were the best in the world and everyone looked at us. Now we have remained behind while others have built their future. 'Sport needs to go back to being the main focus and not the administrative end, which has given the results we have seen in European club competition. 'We need to ask ourselves if our football should only be a transition point for top players.' There was an illusion in Italy, however, that the national team was still in very good shape. The Azzurri enjoyed a surprising runners-up finish at Euro 2012 and they followed that up with third place at last year's Confederations Cup in Brazil. Italy also went unbeaten in World Cup qualifying. All of that seems to have given the fans a false sense of confidence. False dawn: Mario Balotelli's header gave Italy a win in their first game of the tournament against England . Crucial: Diego Godin's header sealed Cesare Prandelli's fate as Uruguay progressed instead of Italy . What was most disappointing about the World Cup was that Italy managed to win their first game, a 2-1 triumph over England in Manaus, yet inexplicably fell flat against unheralded Costa Rica and Uruguay. One result of the early exit was the resignation of coach Cesare Prandelli, who had signed a two-year contract extension before the tournament. 'Our own strength was to have a philosophy of play but in the last two games we lost that,' Prandelli said. 'I don't know why, perhaps for physical or psychological reasons, maybe it was fear.' Perhaps a more damning indictment of the Italian situation was the criticism of their veteran players in the immediate aftermath which was aimed at the new generation. 'You can see who was actually playing on the field and who wasn't there,' Italy captain Gianluigi Buffon said. Blame game: The likes of Buffon (left) and De Rossi (right) have criticised Italy's younger players for their exit . 'All too often you hear about the need for change, that Buffon, (Andrea) Pirlo, (Daniele) De Rossi, (Giorgio) Chiellini and (Andrea) Barzagli are too old. But the truth is when the wagon needs pulling, these are always the ones in the front row. They deserve a bit more respect. 'When you're on the field, you've got to deliver. It doesn't matter what you potentially could deliver, or what you might be able to deliver in future - you've got to deliver it there and then.' It did not help that Italy lost AC Milan captain and veteran midfielder Riccardo Montolivo to a shin fracture during a friendly against the Republic of Ireland shortly before the tournament. Even so, Buffon's rebuke of the younger players was revealing. Decline: No Italian club have won the Champions League since Jose Mourinho's Inter in 2010 . Despair: Reaching the final of Euro 2012 inspired hope of a good World Cup, but the team failed to deliver . The fact that De Rossi was in agreement with Buffon suggested a division existed in the Italy camp. 'I can only underline what Buffon said,' De Rossi said. 'It's true that we embody the right spirit. 'It's also true that we are the ones who always stand up to be counted. 'Anybody who doesn't feel like instilling the same effort and anybody who does not share the same passion should just stay at home.' The president of the Italian Olympic Committee, Giovanni Malago, joined the chorus of criticism. 'From a sporting and football standpoint it has been a failure,' he said. 'I'm disappointed by many things, especially the little quality in our game.' There is an alarming statistic which is likely to be addressed when considering the future of the national team and that is the investment in home-grown players. Back then: Italy won the World Cup in 2006 but haven't reached the knock-out stages since . Needs to learn: Prandelli told Mario Balotelli he needs to use the World Cup experience to improve his game . In the 2013-14 Serie A campaign, only 42 percent of the players on the pitch were Italian and the rest were foreigners. 'We need to work on the Italian movement,' Prandelli said. 'We are in a crisis. 'We only invest in foreign players in the youth teams.' What remains unclear is the future of the most talked about and scrutinised player in the national team, Mario Balotelli. Prandelli not only took the AC Milan striker to Brazil but started him in all three games. Balotelli had a good start by scoring the winning goal against England but did not make an impact against Costa Rica and with Italy fighting for their World Cup lives against Uruguay, Prandelli lost faith in him and replaced him at half-time. 'I told Mario when we said goodbye that if he wants to become the player he thinks he is, he needs to face reality and not live in his virtual world,' Prandelli said. 'I told him that he needs to learn from this experience because the national team needs him.'","Italy went out in group stages for second consecutive World Cup .

"By . Harriet Hernando for MailOnline . Up to 500 rhino will be evacuated from Kruger National Park in South Africa which has been blighted by poachers hunting them for horns. The authorities announced the plan to airlift the animals to safer areas in the country by helicopter because illegal killings have soared in recent years, despite the deployment of soldiers throughout the nature reserve. Figures show a shocking increase - 13 were illegally killed in 2007, while 1,004 were butchered last year. And this year 630 rhinos have already lost their lives – 408 of them in Kruger. 'A decision has been made on this issue of translocation,' said Edna Molewa, South Africa's environment minister on Tuesday. 'Relocations . from the Kruger National Park and the creation of rhino strongholds . could allow the total rhino population size of South Africa to continue . to grow.' Poaching . has decimated the Kruger rhino population.The WWF estimates that there . are just 300 black rhino left in the park, and about 3,000 white rhino. The safest way to travel: A rhino is hoisted high into the air by its ankles in Eastern Cape, South Africa . Up to 500 animals will be evacuated as a result of poaching, which has decimated the rhino population . In . a bid to save the endangered black rhino, conservationists have already . begun transporting them to new homes to encourage breeding in other . nature reserves. The . video features a black rhino being airlifted from the Eastern Cape to a . new home at a 34,000 hectares reserve in Kwa Zulu Natal, South Africa, . as part of the Black Rhino Range Expansion Project. The project, a partnership between conservation groups including WWF and Eastern Cape Parks, was set up in 2003 - with the aim of increasing the population of the critically endangered black rhino by expanding its territory. Over the last decade, nine new black rhino populations have been created in South Africa, with more than 140 rhinos relocated. The beasts were airlifted to a new home at a 34,000 hectares reserve in Kwa Zulu Natal as part of the Black Rhino Range Expansion Project . Hanging in the balance: Illegal rhino killings have soared in recent years, despite the deployment of soldiers through the nature reserve . While the sight of the animal hanging from its ankles might be unsettling to some, it is considered safer than transporting it on the ground because the animal spends less time under anaesthetic. Project leader Dr Jacques Flamand said: 'We used to transport rhinos by lorry over very difficult tracks, or airlifted in a net. This new procedure has proved to be a safer bet. 'As a vet, this is my method of choice because it is quick and harmless to the rhinos, which is always our main concern in these operations. 'All the rhinos have started eating immediately after release – a sure sign that they were not in distress.' Over the last decade, nine new black rhino populations have been created in South Africa, with more than 140 rhinos relocated . The helicopter translocations usually take less than ten minutes and are used to relocate rhinos from inaccessible areas. The purpose of the project, which is in its tenth year, is to increase numbers by providing the animals with more territory to breed on. Seven of the new breeding sites are in KwaZulu-Natal and two are further north in Limpopo. To date more than 40 calves have been born on sites ran by the Black Rhino Range Expansion Project. Good news: Over the last decade, nine new black rhino populations have been created in South Africa, with more than 140 rhinos relocated . In the 1960s, an estimated 65,000 black rhino were found across Africa but poaching decimated their numbers to just 2,000 in the early 1990s. Conservation efforts have now doubled numbers to an estimated 4,000 - but poaching remains the biggest threat to their survival. Rhino have become increasingly vulnerable to poaching as demand for the animal's horns has increased , especially from China. Some conservationists estimate that rhino horn has a street value of £38,000 per kilogram, which makes it more valuable than platinum or gold.","WWF estimates there are just 300 black rhinos left in Kruger National Park .

They came out and defended really well and were very tough to break down,' Ramsey told Sky Sports. 'They lost their manager earlier in the week but you'd never have known that the way they played.

"By . Nick Harris for MailOnline . Everton manager Roberto Martinez is hoping for positive news this week on the knee injury to Ross Barkley that could mean a ‘long, long’ lay-off for the attacking midfielder. But Steven Naismith, the man who replaced the 20-year-old England player on Saturday and scored in the 2-2 curtain raiser at Leicester, insists there was no doom and gloom around the club about Barkley’s situation. Barkley suffered a tear to the medial ligament in his right knee in training on Friday and initial scan results on Saturday morning led Martinez to say his rising star could miss between seven weeks and five months. VIDEO Scroll down to watch We should've won - Martinez . Injury blow: Ross Barkley has suffered a knee ligament injury and could be missing for a 'long' time . Optimism: Steven Naismith (left), seen here celebrating his goal for Everton at Leicester on Saturday with Phil Jagielka, is confident Barkley's absence won't affect the team in the opening part of the season . Honours even: Naismith beats Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel to put Everton 2-1 up at the King Power Stadium but Chris Wood later scored an equaliser to earn a share of the spoils . These teams have now met 17 times in Premier League history, and drawn 12 of those games (71 per cent of them). That’s the biggest draw percentage ever between any two PL teams who’ve met 10 times or more. In his absence Naismith played in a support role behind Everton’s £28million record signing Romelu Lukaku, and scored his side’s second goal after Aiden McGeady’s opener. Leicester’s record £8m signing Leonardo Ulloa scored their first equaliser and 22-year-old Kiwi sub Chris Wood got the second late on. ‘Everybody was ready for the game, people weren’t thinking “Oh no, Ross isn’t playing, it’s going to be a disaster”,’ said Naismith. ‘If you look at our bench, we’ve got Leon Osman and Kevin Mirallas. These guys are well established players who missed out. We’ve definitely got enough players to cover it and excel in those positions as well.’ First blood: Aiden McGeady curled Everton into the lead against the newly-promoted side . Level terms: Leicester's new £8m signing Leonardo Ulloa pulled them level on his Premier League debut . All square: Chris Wood rescued Leicester a point with just four minutes remaining . VIDEO We should've won - Martinez . Naismith said the ‘Barkley role’ was also ‘where I feel most comfortable’. He added: ‘Towards the end of last season I played a lot in there and Ross played wider. I grew up as a striker and I still react and move as a striker when the ball goes in the box.’ Martinez is confident Barkley’s injury is not at the most serious end of the spectrum, categorically ruling out that it could last through the season. ‘No, no, no,’ he said. ‘We’re expecting the next set of scans on Wednesday or Thursday just to make sure there is not inflammation in the knee. 'We’ll know exactly then but as I said medial ligament can go from six weeks to a longer period. In any case it’s not an injury that should rule him out for the season.’ Martinez accepts such absences happen although acknowledges Barkley will be missed. ‘We all share the same problems. [But] it’s important that we get Ross Barkley back fully fit as quick as we can. Upbeat: Everton boss Roberto Martinez believes Barkley's injury will not rule him out for the season . Responsibility: Romelu Lukaku was pressed into a full 90 minutes of action against Leicester . 'September is going to be a very busy month and without Ross it’s going to put a lot of strains and more pressure on other players.’ Lukaku played 90 minutes he would almost certainly not have played if Barkley had been available. ‘Obviously with the injury to Ross we needed Rom to take a bit more responsibility in that attacking role and I couldn't be prouder of his effort and the way he stayed on the pitch for 90 minutes,’ Martinez said. He reiterated Lukaku’s huge fee should not be a burden but a confidence booster. ‘The fee is one way to show how much we perceive him, how much we love him. And I don’t think that is a weight of expectation.’","Ross Barkley suffered a knee ligament injury in training on Friday .

"By . Nick Enoch . Updated: . 10:15 EST, 16 January 2012 . Russian officials have admitted today there is no firm indication where a failed Mars moon probe plummeted to Earth, the day after . it went down. The unmanned Phobos-Ground probe - which had been designed to boost the nation's pride - fell after being stuck in Earth's orbit for two months. News agencies had cited Defence Ministry . spokesman Colonel Alexei Zolotukhin as saying yesterday that fragments of the craft fell . in the Pacific Ocean off Chile's coast, 1,250 km (775 miles) west of Wellington Island. He said the military space tracking facilities . were monitoring the probe's crash - and that the deserted ocean area is where Russia guides its discarded . space cargo ships serving the International Space Station. But Zolotukhin has now revealed the estimate was based on calculations, and no witness reports . had been received. Doomed: The Phobos-Ground probe blasts off successfully in November last year.  It came crashing back to earth on Sunday after its booster rockets failed to ignite and send it on its way to Mars . However, the deputy head of Russia's space agency, . Anatoly Shilov, told state news channel Vesti that agency data assumed the . craft broke up somewhere over Brazil . This theory was reinforced by other sources. RIA Novosti news agency cited . Russian ballistic experts who said the fragments fell over a broader patch of . Earth's surface, spreading from the Atlantic and including the territory of . Brazil. It said the midpoint of the crash zone was located in the Brazilian . state of Goias. Crashdown: A handout image released by the Russian Federal Space Agency Roscosmos mapped the huge area where controllers initially said Phobos-Ground would fall . The $170million craft was one of the . heaviest and most toxic pieces of space junk ever to crash to Earth, but space . officials and experts said the risks posed by its crash were minimal because . the toxic rocket fuel on board and most of the craft's structure would burn up . in the atmosphere high above the ground anyway. The Phobos-Ground was designed to travel . to one of Mars' twin . moons, Phobos, land on it, collect soil samples and fly them back to Earth in . 2014 in one of the most daunting interplanetary missions ever. Re-entry: The probe burns red hot as it approaches Earth's atmosphere in this image captured by the German Tracking and Imaging Radar facility . It got stranded . in Earth's orbit after its November 9 launch, and efforts by Russian and European . Space Agency experts to bring it back to life failed. Professor Heiner Klinkrad, head of The . European Space Agency's Space Debris Office that was monitoring the probe's . descent, said the craft didn't pose any significant risks. 'This one is way, way down in the . ranking,' he said in a telephone interview from his office in Berlin, . adding that booster rockets contain more solid segments that may survive fiery . re-entries. The probe's return to Earth was also monitored by dozens of other organisations, . including the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordinating Committee, an . offshoot of the UN's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer . Space. The panel includes representatives from 12 space agencies, . including Nasa, Russia and China. Thousands of pieces of derelict space . vehicles orbit Earth, occasionally posing danger to astronauts and satellites . in orbit, but as far as is known, no one has ever been hurt by falling space . debris. Russia's space agency Roscosmos predicted . that only between 20 and 30 fragments of the Phobos probe with a total weight . of up to 200kg (440lb) would survive the re-entry and plummet to . Earth. Klinkrad agreed with that assessment, . adding that about 100 metric tons of space junk fall on Earth every year. 'This is 200kg out of these 100 tons,' he said. The Phobos-Ground weighed 13.5 metric tons . (14.9 tons), and that included a load of 11 metric tons (12 tons) of highly . toxic rocket fuel intended for the long journey to the Martian moon of Phobos but which remained unused as the probe got stranded in orbit around Earth. Roscosmos said that all of the fuel would  have burned up on re-entry, a forecast Klinkrad said was supported by calculations . done by Nasa and the ESA. He said the craft's tanks are made of aluminium alloy . that has a very low melting temperature, and they would burst at an altitude of . more than 100km (60 miles). The space era has seen far larger . spacecraft crash. Nasa's Skylab space station that went down in 1979 weighed 77 . metric tons (85 tons) and Russia's Mir space station that de-orbited in 2001 . weighed about 130 metric tons (143 tons). Their descent fuelled fears around the . world, but the wreckage of both fell far away from populated areas. Flying fuel tank: The failed probe contained 11 tons of highly toxic fuel . The Phobos-Ground was Russia's most . expensive and the most ambitious space mission since Soviet times. Its mission . to the crater-dented, potato-shaped Martian moon was to give scientists . precious materials that could shed more light on the genesis of the solar . system. Russia's space chief has acknowledged the . Phobos-Ground mission was ill-prepared, but said that Roscosmos had to give it . the go-ahead so as not to miss the limited Earth-to-Mars launch window. Destination Mars: The Phobos-Ground probe being prepared for launch in November this year . Its predecessor, Mars-96, which was built by the same . Moscow-based NPO Lavochkin company, experienced an engine failure and crashed . shortly after its launch in 1996. Its crash drew strong international fears . because of around 200g of plutonium onboard. The craft eventually showered . its fragments over the Chile-Bolivia border in the Andes Mountains, and the . pieces were never recovered. The worst ever radiation spill from a . derelict space vehicle came in January 1978 when the nuclear-powered Cosmos 954 . satellite crashed over northwestern Canada. The Soviets claimed the craft . completely burned up on re-entry, but a massive recovery effort by Canadian . authorities recovered a dozen fragments, most of which were radioactive. The Phobos-Ground also contained a tiny . quantity of the radioactive metal Cobalt-57 in one of its instruments, but . Roscosmos said it poses no threat of radioactive contamination. The spacecraft also carried a small . cylinder with a collection of microbes as part of an experiment by the . Pasadena, California-based Planetary Society that was designed to explore whether . they could survive interplanetary travel. The cylinder was attached to a capsule . that was supposed to deliver Phobos ground samples back to Earth. Igor Marinin, the editor of Russia's . Novosti Kosmonavtiki magazine, said on Russia's NTV television that it would . likely be destroyed. And Igor Lissov, an . independent Moscow-based space observer said: 'The fuel indeed poses lethal danger . in case of close contact, but I haven’t heard of a single case of any . civilians poisoned by rocket fuel from all the derelict satellites and . failed rockets throughout the space era. 'The objective reality is that it burns on re-entry. There is no reason to panic.' Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said that the probability is low that a large lump of toxic fuel will prove hazardous. He noted that some of the probe’s . equipment is dense and could survive re-entry, but added the odds are . that any surviving pieces have ended up in the ocean. He said: 'All the best rules in the world put . in place to prevent uncontrolled satellites from crashing down do . little if any good in the event of a launch failure. Botched: The ambitious mission was meant to re-install pride in the Russian space agency . 'This is always going to be the risk that something breaks, and you end . up with a situation like this. You can minimise it, but you can’t . prevent it entirely.' Michael Simpson, executive director of the Colorado-based Secure World Foundation, said: 'With 73 per cent of the planet . covered in water, odds are this thing is going to splash down rather . than hit land,' he said. In . 2008, the U.S. Navy shot down a stranded U.S. spy satellite reportedly . to cut the contamination risk of 100lb (45kg) of rocket fuel. That . satellite's tank, however, was believed to have been made of metal . alloys more resistant to heating than aluminium, Simpson said. The . spacecraft is the third large satellite to return to Earth since . September, when Nasa's defunct Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite fell . out of orbit, showering debris into the Pacific Ocean. Germany's Rosat . X-ray telescope re-entered a month later over the Bay of Bengal. Phobos is the larger and closer of the two moons of Mars, the other being Deimos. Both moons were discovered in 1877, Phobos named after the Greek god Phobos, a son of Ares (Mars). A small, irregular-shaped object, Phobos orbits Mars closer than any other known moon orbits its planet. It orbits so close to the planet that . it moves around Mars faster than Mars itself rotates. As a result, from . the surface of the planet, Phobos would rise in the west, move rapidly . across the sky (in a little over four hours) and set in the east. Indeed, its orbit is decaying and will eventually smash into the surface of Mars or break up into a Saturn-like planetary ring. Phobos is one of the least-reflective bodies in the solar system, and features a large impact crater, Stickney crater. Phobos has been photographed in close-up by several spacecraft, whose primary mission has been to photograph Mars. The . first was Mariner 9 in 1971, followed by Viking 1 in 1977, Mars Global . Surveyor in 1998 and 2003, Mars Express in 2004, 2008, and 2010, and . Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2007 and 2008.","Early reports claimed Phobos-Ground came down 775 miles west of Wellington Island in Pacific - but data was based on calculations NOT eyewitnesses .

"By . Rob Cooper . A father forced his three young children to live in squalor in a home knee-deep in rubbish after his partner left him - because it was 'her job to do the cleaning'. Police who raided the dirty home found dog mess, rotting food and even human excrement smeared all over the walls. The 37-year-old father told officers he blamed the conditions - branded 'appalling' by a judge - on his former partner leaving. Knee deep in dirt: These are the vile conditions that three children aged under 12 were forced to live in. Their 37-year-old father avoided jail after admitting child neglect . Filthy: Dog mess was found in the mouldy property and there was human excrement smeared on the walls. The father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, tried to blame the mess on his former partner who he said was responsible for cleaning . Officers discovered the three neglected children - all under 12 - living among empty milk cartons, rotting food and broken glass, with swarms of flies in the air. The cooker in the home in Knowle West, Bristol, was caked in grease and fresh food was left in a fridge that was filled with black mould. Police described the home which had grime smeared on every window as 'the worst they had ever seen'. But despite the conditions the father was spared prison for neglecting his children and was given a suspended sentence. Bristol Crown Court heard that when police first challenged the man - who cannot be named for legal reasons - he refused to let them past the front door. But they went back armed with cameras to capture the squalor. Neil Treharne, prosecuting, said: 'He blamed his ex-partner. He said faeces from the dog littered the house and it was her responsibility. 'He said refuse in the kitchen was from where a dog ripped a bin bag open and it was her responsibility. Dirty: Fresh food sits on the shelves in the fridge which is so mouldy it is completely black in places . 'He said the state of the cooker was her fault as she was responsible for cleaning the house. 'He said he smashed glass in the microwave in a rage and could give no reason as to why it wasn't cleared away.' The father even blamed his children for the mess, claiming they had refused to stop smearing faeces over the walls. He was frequently in trouble in the past and was addicted to heroin until 2000, the court heard. When his long-term partner left him he lost his job and started smoking cannabis causing 'inertia and emotional paralysis'. Filthy: The disgusting kitchen in the property in Bristol. The judge described the conditions in the home as 'appalling' Peter Richardson, defending, said: 'He is utterly ashamed of what occurred at that period of his life, and the effect upon his children. 'The photographs are not pleasant, he fully accepts that. His use of cannabis caused inertia and emotional paralysis. 'There is a world of difference between someone who sets out to be cruel and the result of inadequacy and a drug habit at the time.' The father admitted three counts of child neglect and was given a one-year prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, with a year's supervision order. Judge Timothy Mousley QC told him: 'The photographs show the circumstances in which those three young children were living. 'The conditions were appalling and you should be ashamed of yourself for letting it get into that sort of state.' 'It was associated with neglect. It was not associated with cruelty. It came about because of your inadequacies. 'You accept it came about as a result of the wreckage of the breakdown of your relationship and you went back to taking drugs.'

"By . Graham Smith . and Alex Ward . and Jonathan Petre . Inner circle: Pope Benedict's former butler (circled in the popemobile with the pope in May) was sentenced to 18 months jail stealing the Pope's private documents and leaking them to a journalist . Pope Benedict’s ex-butler Paolo Gabriele has been being found guilty of stealing confidential papers from him and sentenced to 18 months in jail – but is expected to shortly be granted a pardon. Gabriele, 46, was given the prison term yesterday for his role in one of the worst scandals to hit the Vatican in recent years, involving allegations of infighting, intrigue and nepotism, and corruption. Prosecutors in the so-called ‘Vatileaks’ case had asked the Vatican court for a three-year sentence for the ex-butler – who had collected a huge number of stolen documents at his apartment within the Vatican. But the presiding judge Giuseppe Dalla Torre reduced  the sentence on the grounds of  Gabriele’s  service to the Church and his apology to the Pope for betraying him. The Vatican’s spokesman Federico Lombardi said after the verdict that the Pope was ‘very likely’ to pardon Gabriele, who claimed he had been motivated by a desire to root out ‘corruption and evil’ at the heart of the Church. Lombardi, who described the verdict as ‘mild and fair’, said Gabriele would remain under house arrest ‘while the Pope  evaluates his position’, adding that he did not know when a pardon might be granted. The sentence was read out two hours after Gabriele, a father of three, gave a final address to the special court at the end of his week-long trial, insisting that he was not a thief. He said: ‘The thing that I feel strongly in me is the conviction that I acted only out of visceral love for the Church of Christ and for its visible head. I do not feel like I’m a thief.’ Gabriele handed much of the Pope’s stolen correspondence to journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi, who wrote a book revealing the plotting and petty infighting at the top of the Church, as well as allegations of corruption, nepotism and homosexual affairs. Scroll down for video . Guilty verdict: Gabriele (right sitting in court on September 29) was given a reduced sentence today because of mitigating circumstances including the fact that he had no previous record . The book, His Holiness: Pope Benedict XVI’s Secret Papers, sent shockwaves through the Vatican and prompted the Pope to set up an inquiry into the leaks. Many of the documents contain criticism of the Vatican’s powerful Secretary of State, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who is seen as a divisive figure at the top of the Church. Gabriele’s defence lawyer told the court that the former butler had merely photocopied documents and had leaked them out of a desire to ‘do good’. But Vatican police and the Pope’s private secretary, Monsignor Georg Ganswein, said that original documents were among the 82 boxes of evidence that they seized from the Vatican apartment in May. Some of them were so sensitive that they had been marked by Pope Benedict, in German, ‘to be destroyed’. At the end of the trial yesterday, as Gabriele looked on impassively, the judge said: ‘In the name of his holiness Pope Benedict XVI, who reigns in glory, and invoking the Holy Trinity ... this court sentences the defendant to three years in prison.’ But Judge Dalla Torre then reduced the term, saying he had taken into consideration ‘the absence of a criminal record, his service record preceding these charges and the subjective though erroneous motivation provided by the defendant as to his motivation’. Gabriele’s ‘declaration of his acknowledgement of having betrayed the trust of the holy father’ had weighed in his favour and led to a shorter sentence. He claimed he was helping the 85-year-old pontiff as he feared Benedict XVI was being ‘manipulated’. The Vatican’s criminal law dates back to the 19th Century and the Pope holds wide powers – including the right to dismiss a case at any point during a trial. Papacy crises: The documents were leaked to journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi whose book disclosed allegations of corruption and homosexual liaisons within the Roman Catholic Church (Gabriele pictured with the pope and private secretary Georg Gaenswein in May) Stefano De Santis was one of four Vatican police officers who said they found the papers in the 46-year-old's home. He told the Vatican courtroom: 'You can . understand our unease when we saw these documents. This was a total . violation of the privacy of the papal family.' Book on intrigue: The documents were leaked to Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi who wrote a book making allegations about the Roman Catholic Church's leadership . It threw an unflattering spotlight on the inner workings of a city-state eager to shake off a series of scandals involving sexual abuse of minors by clerics around the world and mismanagement at its bank. Gabriele, a trusted servant who served the pope meals, helped him dress and rode in the popemobile, has admitted passing papers to the journalist at secret meetings, but told the court at a previous hearing he did not see this as a crime. The former butler sat impassively and occasionally smiled during Wednesday's 75-minute session as Vatican policemen told the court how they searched his apartment in the Vatican on May 23, the night of his arrest, and what they found. The mass of incriminating documents, most of which were hidden in huge piles of papers stashed in a large wardrobe, included personal letters between the pope, cardinals and politicians on a variety of subjects. Some papers, De Santis said, bore the . pope's handwriting and had been marked 'to be destroyed' by the pontiff . in German. He did not say what those papers concerned. Some of the documents were copies of encrypted documents. De Santis told the court: 'One photocopy was enough to threaten the operations of the Holy See.' The agents said they found a mass of . documents and books filled with newspaper clippings on the occult, . secret services, Masonic lodges, yoga, political scandals in Italy, . scandals involving the Vatican bank and other subjects. For 'love' of the church: Gabriele (right in the court room on September 29) said in court 'I don't feel like a thief' in his final appeal . Leak: Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi (right) said the pope would study the court file following the conviction of his former butler Paolo Gabriele (pictured left as the verdict was delivered) Verdict: Gabriele (right) was found guilty by a Vatican tribunal of stealing confidential documents from the desk of Pope Benedict . Ms Arru sought to turn the spotlight on police methods during the search, drawing out several agents to say that they had not used gloves when they handled the documents, and a gold nugget and a cheque for 100,000 euros made out to the pope which were also found. Police said Gabriele, once one of fewer than ten people who had the key to an elevator leading to the private papal apartment, had printed instructions on how to hide files in computers and how to use mobile phones secretly. Bishop Francesco Cavina, who knew . Gabriele in the Vatican, told Italian newspaper La Repubblica on . Wednesday that the butler, a father-of-three, may have a 'disturbed . mind' and 'a split personality'. Police told the hearing that some of the papers bore the Pope's handwriting and had been marked 'to be destroyed' by the pontiff in German . Pope Benedict's former butler Paolo Gabriele seen in the Vatican Courthouse . Two of the four policemen who testified on Wednesday also rejected Gabriele's accusations, made on Tuesday, that he was mistreated for several weeks after his arrest. Gabriele told the court's previous hearing that for up to 20 days he was held in a room so small he could not stretch out his arms and that the light was left on 24 hours a day, causing him eye damage.A Vatican judge ordered an investigation into the allegations. De Santis said the search turned up 'many more' papers than appeared in a book by Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi, who wrote a muckraking expose early in 2012. The letters to the pope included one in which a senior Vatican functionary expressed concern about corruption in the Holy See's business dealings with Italian companies. The letter-writer, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, was posted to Washington after raising the issue, despite begging to be allowed to stay at the papal state. VIDEO: Guilty!

"By . Emily Allen . Prescription painkillers have topped car accidents as the leading cause of accidental death in the U.S., according to a new report. Research by the National Center for Health Statistics show that drug poisoning is now a more common way to go than being killed on the road. It follows recent celebrity deaths from painkillers, including Michael Jackson, Heath Ledger and Anna Nicole Smith. Pills: Michael Jackson, who died in 2009, and Heath Ledger, who died in 2008, both took prescription painkillers which have become very popular in America . Prescription painkillers are now so popular in the U.S. that there has been a spike in armed robberies at pharmacies and some chemists are refusing to stock them. The number of robberies has surged by 82 per cent since 2006, from 385 to 701 last year, with 3,500 pharmacies targeted by those desperate to get their hands on the drugs, according to Digg.com. Doctors are also struggling to keep up with the demand for the pills. One third of all Americans take two or more prescription drugs, most commonly narcotics. On the up: This graph shows how poisoning from prescription drugs has increased significantly, especially in the last decade . Without painkillers, such as . OxyContin and Vicodin, minor aches and pains feel considerably worse for . people addicted and withdrawal symptoms include depression, anxiety, . and lethargy. The gap in life expectancy between whites and blacks in America is now the smallest ever, according to researchers in Canada. White men can now expect to live to 76.2 years, and black men 70.8 . years. White women can expect to live to 81.2 years and black women 77.5 . years. Researchers found that HIV and heart disease contributed to the . narrowing of the gap alongside an increase in the number of deaths among . white people from prescription drug abuse. Researchers at Montreal's McGill's University used data from the US . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other sources. They found heart disease, diabetes, homicide, HIV and infant . mortality were the main reasons for the differences in life expectancy. After studying the data, they said more and more white people were dying 'unintentionally' from fatal drug poisoning, largely from opiates and other painkillers . Painkillers . overtook car accidents as the leading cause of death back in 2008 but a . report detailing the information has only just come out this month. It shows that the number of people . dying from the pills has tripled since 1980, while the number of car . accidents has dropped by one-and-a-half times since that year. In 2008, 41,000 Americans died from . drug poisoning - 77 per cent of which were not intentional - compared to . 38,000 road deaths. Between 1999 and 2008, the poisoning death rate increased by 90 per cent, while the road deaths decreased by 15 per cent. Meanwhile, emergency department visits for prescription painkiller abuse or misuse have doubled in the last five years to nearly 500,000 and about 12 million American teenagers and adults use prescription painkillers to get 'high'. Nonmedical prescription painkillers costs the U.S. economy more than $72.5billion each year. The problem with prescription painkillers is worse in the U.S. due to a lack of regulation and a thriving black market. Experts said there is a lack of . education surrounding the drugs and misconceptions over their use and . how they should be managed. They also say pharmaceutical industry have introduced some 'questionable practices' in how the drugs are marketed. Some . insurers say doctors have to explain why they have prescribed certain . pills that exceed a 30-day supply, according to the website, while 40 . states have systems to monitor who the drugs are supplied, although many . of these are voluntary. Problem: Experts say there's a lack of education surrounding the drugs and misconceptions over their use and how they should be managed . Last month, it emerged that where there has been a crackdown in prescription painkillers people are turning to heroin instead.

"By . Rob Waugh . A mysterious ancient building in Syria, described as a 'landscape for the dead' could be as old as 10,000 years ago - far older than the Great Pyramid. But scientists have been unable to explore the ruins, unearthed in 2009, because of the conflict in the region. The strange stone formations were uncovered in 2009, by archaeologist Robert Mason of the Royal Ontario Museum, who came across stone lines, circles, and tombs in a near-lifeless area of desert. The strange stone formations were uncovered in 2009, by archaeologist Robert Mason of the Royal Ontario Museum, who came across stone lines, circles, and tombs in a near-lifeless area of desert near a  monastery (pictured) The strange formations were found around 50 miles north of Damascus. The area has been plagued by violence during the current unrest, including a massacre of 10 people in the village of Bakha north of the capital . Mason talked about the finds at Harvard’s Semitic Museum, said that more investigation is required to understand the mysterious rock structures - and how old they are - but Mason is unsure whether he will ever be able to return to the ruins. The strange formations were found around 50 miles north of Damascus. The area has been plagued by violence during the current unrest, including a massacre of 10 people in the village of Bakha north of the capital. Research teams have been unable to return to the area since the discovery. Mason thinks that the rock formations could date to the Neolithic period or early Bronze Age, 6,000 to 10,000 years ago. The stones are arranged simply to stand out from the landscape - and are highly unusual because there are no signs of dwelling places anywhere. 'What it looked like was a landscape for the dead and not for the living,' Mason said. 'It’s something that needs more work and I don’t know if that’s ever going to happen.' The mysterious formations were discovered near the Deir Mar Musa monastery in Syria . The formations were found near a monastery, Deir Mar Musa, which was occupied until the 19th century, and is home to spectacular Christian frescoes .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Sean Cruise, 52, was found dead at his flat in Southampton, Hampshire (pictured) three days after carers went in and opened the curtains . A man lay dead in his home for six days after visiting carers failed to spot his body on the floor despite opening curtains next to where he was slumped. Sean Cruise, 52, was found on the floor next to a radiator at his flat in Southampton, Hampshire, three days after carers went in and opened the curtains directly above him. Mr Cruise’s ‘disappearance’ sparked a massive missing-persons inquiry and police spent three days hunting for him, but not at his flat. The blunder has called into question how carers could fail to see the body, which his brother said they would have ‘tripped over’. One of the carers who searched the flat told an inquest it was a ‘mystery’ she did not see his body. Sue Grantham, care coordinator with NHS Southern Health’s community health team, visited the property when he had not been seen for three days. She was joined by a care worker and a representative from the landlord last December after Mr Cruise failed to show up for a doctor’s appointment. She told the inquest: ‘I find it very difficult to think that I was walking around the room and didn’t see him. ‘I genuinely didn’t see him. That has been a mystery to me throughout the whole thing, to think that he could have been in there and I didn’t see him.’ Police were called and launched a missing person investigation for Mr Cruise, who lived alone, Southampton Coroner’s Court was told. Officers eventually found him slumped on the floor three days later, when they searched the flat themselves. Tests revealed he died from a heart attack. Mr Cruise’s brother Seamus Cruise questioned how the carers failed to see the body. Mr Cruise, from Southampton, told the hearing: ‘Whoever drew the curtains would have tripped over the body. ‘Someone needs to be accountable so that it doesn’t happen to someone else. That is all we can ask for.’ Care bosses insisted lessons had been learned following Mr Cruise’s death. He received regular home visits from the team and members of the Society of St James, a registered charity for the homeless, during his life. But before he died, he refused to allow carer workers into his home for several weeks. Hampshire deputy coroner Gordon Denson slammed health bosses for the failings in care. Giving a determination of death by natural causes, Mr Denson said: ‘I consider that there was a considerable breakdown in the level of care that Sean should have been expected to receive during the latter part of his life.’ Hampshire deputy coroner Gordon Denson slammed health bosses for the failings in care at the inquest at Southampton Coroner's Court (pictured) He added that he hoped a report compiled by Southern Health admitting failings in the incident was ‘fully implemented” so it would not happen again. A spokesman from Southern Health NHS said: ‘As Sean became more unwell, it became more difficult to support him and our staff struggled to gain access to his flat. ‘We have investigated the way we were supporting Sean and, although we were providing regular care, a more assertive approach may have improved the level of contact we were able to achieve.’ A spokesman from Society of St James said the set-up gave Mr Cruise independence. He said: ‘The scheme is not designed to provide daily monitoring of clients, as this reduces independence and prevents people developing independent life skills. ‘The society ensured that Mr Cruise was visited several times a week, having regular contact with staff.’ Hampshire police, who were quizzed by the coroner about why they did not immediately search Mr Cruise’s home when he was reported missing, did not comment.","Sean Cruise, 52, was found dead at his home after suffering a heart attack .

"At least 156 people have been killed and thousands more left injured after a powerful earthquake jolted China's Sichuan province near the same area where a devastating quake struck five years ago. More than 5,500 people are reported to have been injured in the earthquake which struck mountainous Lushan county shortly after 8am this morning local time, and 19 people have been reported missing in the wake of the tremor. The earthquake, while not as destructive as the one in 2008, toppled buildings, triggered landslides and disrupted phone and power connections in the region. Scroll down for video . Destruction: This aerial photograph shows the damage caused by the earthquake in Lushan county, Ya'an, in China's Sichuan province . The village of Longmen was hit . particularly hard, with authorities saying nearly all the buildings . there had been destroyed by the terrifying minute-long tremor. The China Earthquake Administration said at least 156 people had died, . including 96 in Lushan. In the jurisdiction of Ya'an, which administers . Lushan, 19 people were reported missing and more than 5,500 people were . injured, the administration said. 'It was such a big quake that everyone . was scared,' said a woman who answered the phone at a kindergarten hours . later and declined to give her name. 'We all fled for our lives.' Emergency workers turned the square outside the Lushan County Hospital into a . triage center, where medical personnel bandaged bleeding victims, . according to footage on China Central Television. Rescuers used dynamite to clear . boulders that had fallen across roads to reach Longmen and other damaged . areas lying farther up the mountain valleys, state media reported. The quake - measured by the earthquake administration at magnitude-7.0 . and by the U.S. Geological Survey at 6.6 - struck the steep hills of . Lushan county shortly after 8 a.m., when many people were at home, . sleeping or having breakfast. People in their underwear and wrapped in . blankets ran into the streets of Ya'an and even the provincial capital . of Chengdu, 70 miles east of Lushan, according to . photos, video and accounts posted online. The quake's shallow depth, less than 8 miles, is likely to have magnified its impact. Chengdu's airport shut down for about an hour before reopening, though . many flights were cancelled or delayed, and its railway station halted . dozens of scheduled train rides Saturday, state media said. Lushan reported the most deaths, but there was concern that casualties . in neighboring Baoxing county might have been under-reported because of . inaccessibility after roads were blocked and power and phone services . cut off. Shocking scenes: The sign outside this collapsed building in Sichuan province, where the earthquake struck at around 8am local time, is understood to be a kindergarten . Confusion: Girls in their pyjamas gathered outside buildings in Chongqing, China, after the earthquake hit this morning . As the region went into the first night after the quake, rain started to . fall, slowing rescue work. Forecasts are pointing to more rain over the coming days, and the China Meteorological Administration warned of . possible landslides and other geological disasters. Tens of thousands of people moved into tents or cars, unable to return . home or too afraid to go back as aftershocks continued to jolt the . region. Lushan, where the quake struck, lies where the fertile Sichuan plain . meets foothills that eventually rise to the Tibetan plateau and sits . atop the Longmenshan fault. It was along that fault line that a . devastating magnitude-7.9 quake struck on May 12, 2008, leaving more . than 90,000 people dead or missing and presumed dead in one of the worst . natural disasters to strike China in recent decades. 'It was just like May 12,' Liu Xi, a writer in Ya'an city, who was . jolted awake by today's quake, said via a private message on his . account on Sina Corporation's Twitter-like Weibo service. 'All the home . decorations fell at once, and the old house cracked.' The official Xinhua News Agency said the well-known Bifengxia panda . preserve, which is near Lushan, was not affected by the quake. Dozens of . pandas were moved to Bifengxia from another preserve, Wolong, after its . habitat was wrecked by the 2008 quake. As in most natural disasters, the government mobilized thousands of . soldiers and others - 7,000 people by this afternoon - sending . excavators and other heavy machinery as well as tents, blankets and . other emergency supplies. Two soldiers died after the vehicle that they . and more than a dozen others were in slipped off the road and rolled . down a cliff, state media reported. Aftermath: People were seen walking over the rubble of collapsed buildings after the devastating earthquake in China this morning . Tremors: This photograph shows an enormous rock blocking a road about 20km from Lushan in Ya'an city . Taking shelter: Families were seen gathered outside a building in Chengdu, China this morning in the aftermath of the earthquake . Casualties: People gathered on the street and away from buildings in Shifang in Sichuan province in case of aftershocks . Premier Li Keqiang flew to Ya'an to direct rescue efforts, and he and . President Xi Jinping ordered officials and rescuers to make saving . people the top priority, Xinhua said. The Chinese Red Cross said it had deployed relief teams with supplies of . food, water, medicine and rescue equipment to the disaster areas. With roads blocked for several hours after the quake, the military . surveyed the disaster area by air. Aerial photos released by the . military and shown on state television showed individual houses in ruins . in Lushan and outlying villages flattened into rubble. The roofs of . some taller buildings appeared to have slipped off, exposing the floors . beneath them. A person whose posts to the micro-blogging account 'Qingyi Riverside' on . Weibo carried a locator geotag for Lushan said many buildings collapsed . and that people could spot helicopters hovering above. The earthquake administration said there had been at least 712 aftershocks, including two of magnitude-5.0 or higher. 'It's too dangerous,' said a person with the Weibo account . Chengduxinglin and with a Lushan geotag. 'Even the aftershocks are . scary.' While rescuers and state media rushed to the disaster scene, China's . active social media users filled the information gap. They posted photos . of people fleeing to streets for safety and of buildings flattened by . the quake. They shared information on the availability of phone . services, apparently through data services.","Warnings death toll could rise with more than 5,500 left injured .

Yang Guang reclines in the sunshine and gets ready to mate with his female partner Tian Tian. She has only a 36-hour annual fertility window when she can mate. She was also photographed today as she relaxed by her pool while anxious staff wait for her hormone levels to peak. Scroll down for video . Ready to mate: Yang Guang relaxes in as he prepares to mate with Tian Tian in the annual 36-hour window of opportunity . Come and get me! Yang Guang, here in his enclosure today, is kept apart from his female mate because of the risk they will attack each other until she is ready to mate . Experts believe she is now almost ready to accept the advances of the male because her grumpy behaviour and loss of appetite suggest she is in season. When scientists believe the time is right, the pair will meet up to three times a day for 15 to 30-minute intervals. The pair were introduced to each other during breeding season last year but they failed to mate. Throughout the rest of the year the two giant pandas are kept apart because they are naturally territorial and could attack one another. Tian Tian and Yang Guang are the first giant pandas to live in the UK for 17 years. Laid back: The two pandas failed to mate when encouraged to do so by staff at the zoo a year ago . Get me! Tian Tian enjoys the pool in her enclosure at Edinburgh Zoo as she approaches her annual window of opportunity when her hormones are high . Edinburgh Zoo, where the pair have lived since their arrival from China in December 2011, has employed a number of measures to synchronise the breeding cycles of the pandas, including controlled lighting, urine testing for hormone levels and enclosure swapping. If Tian Tian does fall pregnant, it will be July or the first half of August when Edinburgh Zoo experts will be able to confirm it by using ultrasound scans. The majority of giant panda cubs are born at the very end of August or beginning of September. Although females may give birth to two young, usually only one survives. Prepared: Male Yang Guang, pictured, will be put together three times a day for 15 - 30 minutes with his female mate when zoo staff try and get them to mate . The giant pandas’ naturally slow breeding rate prevents a population in the wild from recovering quickly from illegal hunting, habitat loss, and other human-related causes of mortality. A spokeswoman for the zoo said: 'Things are looking very positive. Tian Tian's hormones are continuing to rise and we are waiting for her to hit her peak. 'Yang Guang is ready to go. He has been doing lots of scent-marking. It's just a question of waiting now.' Exploring: Yang Guang has a look round his enclosure just hours before he is encouraged to mate .

"By . Lucy Osborne . Interflora has been forced to remove British labelling from bouquets after it emerged many of its flowers come from abroad. The firm had said that half of the blooms in its £195 Valentine’s day gift were UK-grown – a claim that checks showed to be false. Experts found that the red chrysanthemums in the bouquet are not even available in Britain at this time of year. 'British grown': Interflora's claims about having flowers grown in the UK were proven to be false. Here is where they really come from . When a dozen independent Interflora florists nationwide were called at random, half admitted that all their flowers came from Holland and some came from as far as Colombia. Red tulips and ivy were the only British-grown of the ten varieties of flower in the bouquet – and only a quarter of the florists had either in stock. Industry experts say that British-grown red chrysanthemums are not available anywhere in the UK at this time of year and it is highly unlikely anywhere will be growing white hyacinths or myrtle commercially either. Embarrassingly, Interflora have now caved in to demands that it ditch its controversial ‘British grown’ icons and have admitted that it ‘cannot guarantee’ the source of its flowers. Even one of the country’s biggest wholesalers which specialises in British-grown flowers, Pratley of London’s New Covent Garden Market, had only the red tulips from this country. Interflora accepts that the remaining five flowers in its bouquets - red and pink roses, lilac, agapanthus and amaranth - are all imported. 'Out of our control': Interflora said they cannot guarantee where each store gets their flowers from . Grower Gill Hodgson, a campaigner for the British flower industry, estimates that the bouquet’s flowers have covered up to 188,447 air miles. She said: ‘Interflora’s florists are having a difficult time making ends meet. ‘If it is left to them whether to buy cheap imported flowers or more expensive British flowers, naturally they will buy the cheaper ones. ‘Interflora has really shot themselves in the foot by claiming their flowers are British-grown. ‘The few chrysanthemum growers left in Britain do not use heat and you need that to grow them at this time of year. ‘We say it is not very likely the flowers in their bouquets will be British-grown and the fact they have retracted their icons means they cannot justify their claims. She added: ‘The RHS are the main British gardening organisation and they should be promoting British growers and not endorsing a product that is predominantly imported. ‘Right now, British growers have superb tulips grown in Lincolnshire, stunning anemones and gloriously scented narcissi from Cornwall and the Scillies. ‘To see the RHS then championing scentless flowers mass-produced in South America is soul-destroying.’ Louise Curley, author of The Cut Flower Patch, said: ‘It’s disappointing the RHS didn’t take the opportunity to promote British flowers. ‘Just as we’ve done with food, we need to be looking at sourcing locally-grown flowers and growing our own. ‘Apart from the environmental cost, imported blooms mean we have lost touch with the seasons.’ According to the RHS and Interflora, the bouquet’s flowers “encapsulate the meaning of love in all its forms’. Interflora’s expert florist David Ragg, who created the bouquet, said: ‘Whether it’s the deep velvety reds of the Grand Prix roses or the sweet smelling lilac, all the elements come together to portray a symphony of affection.’ An Interflora spokeswoman said yesterday: ‘We have got 1,800 independent florists and they all source their own stock. ‘There is a certain percentage of the stems that can be sourced as British-grown but it is out of our control where each individual florist gets their stems from. ‘We cannot guarantee that every one of those florists is going to source British-grown stems. ‘To avoid being misleading in any way, we decided we would take the ‘British-grown’ icons off.’ A percentage of all proceeds from Interflora’s bouquets is going towards RHS charitable activities. An RHS spokesman said that is ‘extremely committed to supporting British horticulture.’","Retailer forced to remove British labelling after it was found to be false .

"By . Associated Press . A Texas banker is upping the ante to $1 million for whoever solves a tricky problem that's been dogging mathematicians since the 1980s. The Providence, Rhode Island-based American Mathematical Society (AMS) on Tuesday said $1 million will be awarded for the publication of a solution to the Beal Conjecture number theory problem. Dallas banker D. Andrew Beal first offered the Beal Prize in 1997 for $5,000. Over the years, the amount has grown. Hidden talent: The aim of the Beal Prize is to bring out hidden mathematical geniuses, like Matt Damon's character in Good Will Hunting, and give them a chance to shine...and earn $1million in the process . AMS spokesman Michael Breen says a . solution is more difficult than the one for a related problem - Fermat's . Last Theorem - which didn't have a published solution for hundreds of . years. Mr Beal is a . self-taught mathematician and founder of the Beal Prize. He says he . wants to inspire young people to pursue math and science. An AMS-appointed committee will award . this prize for either a proof of, or a counterexample to, the Beal . Conjecture, published in a refereed and respected mathematics . publication. The prize money is being held in trust by the AMS until it is awarded. Income from the prize fund is used to support the annual Erdős Memorial Lecture and other activities of the Society. Prize: The American Mathematical Society is holding $1million in a trust fund for whomever can solve the Beal Conjecture puzzle . According to the AMS website, the $1million prize will be awarded to anyone who can solve and fulfill the following: . If A<sup>x</sup> + B<sup>y</sup> = C<sup>z</sup> where A, B, . C, x, y and z are positive integers and x, y and z are all greater than 2, then . A, B and C must have a common prime factor. The administration of the Beal Prize is overseen by a Beal Prize Committee (BPC) to be appointed by the President of the AMS. The formal charge of the BPC and the 'Procedures for Determination of an Award of the Beal Prize' are subject to the review and approval by the Council of the AMS. The Beal Prize Fund is held as a restricted asset of the American Mathematical Society (AMS), with US$1,000,000 to be awarded if, in the judgment of the BPC, the conjecture is proved or a counterexample is presented. A proposed solution of the Beal Prize Problem may not be submitted directly to the AMS, or to the Beal Prize Committee, or to Mr Beal. Unpublished manuscripts will not be considered. The BPC will consider a proposed solution if it is a complete mathematical solution of the Beal Prize Problem. Before consideration, a proposed solution (the 'Work') must be published in a refereed mathematics publication which is respected and, in the opinion of the BPC, maintains the highest editorial standards (or published in another form as the BPC decides may qualify). In the case of a counterexample, the proposed solution will be subject to independent verification. Upon publication, the author(s) of the Work should notify the AMS and the BPC. The Work must be widely accepted by the mathematics community following a two-year waiting period after publication. In the case of a counterexample, that recognition and acceptance by the community may happen much sooner. Following the waiting period, the BPC will decide whether the Work merits detailed evaluation.If the Work is to receive detailed evaluation, the BPC and the AMS will identify at least two experts who can verify the correctness of the Work and who are not members of the BPC to assist in the evaluation. Upon completion of the evaluation, if the BPC can make a clear decision, it may award the prize and determine attribution of credit for a solution.

"By . Larisa Brown . It is a social website considered to be a lifeline for elderly people who live at home on their own and find comfort in talking to others over the internet. But over-50s group Saga has been forced to shut its network site down because it cannot 'afford' the man power to police 'offensive' comments. It comes after dozens of its users have complained of being blocked from posting on Saga Zone, the group's social site, after 'trying to speak up for others'. Over-50s group Saga has been forced to shut down its social network site which is a lifeline to many pensioners . It came after people were banned from posting racist comments on one of the forums but the recent block of people from the site were said to be unexplainable. Yesterday Saga Zone released a statement on its website claiming it would shut down the site as of February 26 after its users were posting 'controversial and offensive content'. Paul Green, a spokesman for the company, explained: 'There were some particularly vicious exchanges recently about the Middle East and some people were banned after accusations of making anti-semitic or anti-arab comments. The Saga Zone website now has this message for users explaining it has had to close due to offensive messages being posted . 'The majority are a good group of people . but a minority caused concern with offensive and potentially . racist or homophobic comments. 'We even discovered what I believe are . called trolls with multiple online personalities, because messages were . coming from the same computer – sometimes with names from both sexes. 'An online free-for-all might be alright for other social networks such as Twitter but expectations are different when there is the Saga logo in the top right-hand corner.' Closed down: One angry user wrote to the director general of Saga, Ros Altmann (pictured) claiming people have been banned for no reason . But in a letter by former user Cynthia Arnold, 62, from North Yorkshire, written to the director general of Saga, Ros Altmann, it was claimed people were being banned 'for no good reason'. Widow Mrs Arnold had been a member of the website for five years, meeting her partner on the site and having made many good friends over the years. When her partner died from cancer last year, she found Saga zone supported her, enabling her to talk to people every day when she was home alone. She wrote in her letter addressed to Dr Altmann on Monday: 'I use it every day. It gives me someone to say good morning to each morning and stops me feeling quite so alone. 'However, this came to an end yesterday when they banned me from the site with no notice. Over the last month or two a huge number of people have been banned for no good reason.

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . A series of photos celebrating the majesty of the North American landscape have been released to celebrate 50 years of a landmark act put into place to preserve vast swathes of untamed and beautiful land. The photos, featured in the September issue of National Geographic, show the rugged vistas of New Mexico, Montana and Washington. President Lyndon Johnson signed the Wilderness Act in 1964 to give future generations a 'glimpse of the world as it was in the beginning'. The Wilderness Act was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964. But to understand the genesis of the act, you have to go back another three decades, to the 1930s, writes National Geographic's Elizabeth Kolbert. Genesis: Forty years before the Wilderness Act, 755,000 acres in New Mexico’s Gila National Forest, including the Middle Fork of the Gila River, became the world’s first designated wilderness . Icy calm: Day breaks on the Front Range in Montana. The mountains and plains in this region shelter a rich collection of plants and wildlife, including grizzly bears . Patos Island, Washington, is part of a thousand-acre national monument created last year by President Barack Obama. Wilderness, a higher form of land protection, covers 350 acres of the San Juans—but only Congress can designate a wilderness . During the Great Depression tens of thousands of Americans were put to work by the federal government in national parks and forests. They cleared trails, erected shelters, and laid down mile after mile of pavement. The Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park was opened in 1933, Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park in 1939. The new highways opened up the parks to millions more visitors. But the very success of these efforts troubled many conservationists, who worried that the country's most majestic landscapes were being turned into so many roadside attractions. A group of them, including Aldo Leopold, got together to defend the national parks and forests against overuse. They called themselves the Wilderness Society, and their first mission statement denounced the roadbuilding 'craze.' 'The fashion is to barber and manicure wild America as smartly as the modern girl,' it said. 'Our duty is clear.' In 1924, while working with the Forest Service in New Mexico, Leopold had persuaded his superiors to designate 755,000 acres of the Gila National Forest as roadless wilderness. The challenge was to persuade Congress to give that idea national scope. Snow clings to aspens near Taos, New Mexico, in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. A proposal to protect 45,000 acres here in the Carson National Forest is one of some 30 wilderness bills before Congress . Soaptree yuccas soak up morning light in southern New Mexico. 'I am not finished,' the president said in May, as he created this newest national monument. 'I’m searching for more opportunities' The Wilderness Act went through more than 60 drafts before it finally passed. It created a new category of federal lands that could be overlaid on the old like a transparency on a map. Congress—and only Congress—could place land in the new category. Once designated as wilderness, a tract would be off-limits to commercial ventures like logging and new mines. It would be available for humans to explore, but not with mechanized vehicles. Horses and canoes are allowed; mountain bikes have been ruled out. 'A wilderness,' the statute observed in surprisingly lyrical terms, is 'an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.' The 1964 act set aside 54 such areas. The pictures feature in September's edition of National Geographic. Right, Hubbard Glacier Gilbert Point in Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park, Alaska . 'If future generations are to remember us with gratitude rather than contempt,' President Johnson said after signing the act, then 'we must leave them a glimpse of the world as it was in the beginning, not just after we got through with it.' Since Johnson signed the act, the number of wilderness areas has increased to more than 750. They range from the tiny Pelican Island Wilderness in central Florida, which is just 5.5 acres, to the immense Wrangell–St. Elias Wilderness, which at nearly 9.1 million acres is bigger than Belgium. All told, officially designated wilderness covers five per cent of the U.S., an area larger than California. The newest wilderness area, part of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore on Lake Michigan, was added just this past March.","There are now 750 wilderness areas, covering five per cent of the U.S. landmass .

"By . Dan Miller . Updated: . 04:36 EST, 24 January 2012 . A clinical trial of 'magic mushroom therapy' could take place in the UK within a year following two ground-breaking studies. Doctors plan to treat depressed patients who cannot be helped by modern drugs or behaviour-based psychotherapy with the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms. Psilocybin would slowly be infused into their bloodstreams while they receive a carefully tailored 'talking therapy'. Hallucinogenic: Volunteers are to be given the active ingredient in magic mushrooms in a controversial study to test whether they may help in cases of depression . The controversial trial is planned by Professor David Nutt, from Imperial College London, who three years ago was sacked as the Government’s chief drug adviser. Prof Nutt, former chairman of the Advisory Committee on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), clashed with then Home Secretary Alan Johnson after criticising the decision to toughen the law on cannabis. The move to investigate psilocybin as a possible treatment for serious depression is linked to results from two far-reaching scientific studies. In one, volunteers were given psilocybin infusions while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans. The findings, reported today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed the drug disconnected two key 'hub' regions of the brain with multiple connections to other areas. One of these regions, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to be hyperactive in people with depression. The . other, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) at the back of the brain, . is thought to play a role in consciousness and self-identity. The . second study, soon to be published in the British Journal of . Psychiatry, found that the magic mushroom chemical enhanced memories . associated with positive emotions. Scans . showed that the memory experience was very “real”. Activity was . increased in brain regions that processed vision and other sensory . information. Prof Nutt said the findings were 'a revelation'. 'Psychedelics . are thought of as ‘mind-expanding’ drugs so it has commonly been . assumed that they work by increasing brain activity, but surprisingly, . we found that psilocybin actually caused activity to decrease in areas . that have the densest connections with other areas. Professor David Nutt was sacked as the Government’s chief drug adviser after claiming science did not . support the decision to re-classify cannabis as a class C . drug . 'These hubs constrain our experience of the world and keep it orderly. We now know that deactivating these regions leads to a state in which the world is experienced as strange.' It is the first time serious research has been carried out on the effects of 'psychedelic' drugs for more than 50 years. In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists investigating drugs such as LSD and psilocybin carried out studies on around 40,000 patients and published 1,000 papers. Such work was brought to an abrupt halt when the drugs came to be seen as social evils and were made illegal. 'They got banned because they could be society changing,' said Prof Nutt. 'There was great concern about that. Since then they’ve been virtually impossible to research.' He said finding support for the new studies had been 'damned difficult'. Neither the Medical Research Council (MRC) nor the Wellcome Trust, Britain’s biggest research charity, had been willing to fund them. And both Nature and Science, the two most prestigious scientific journals, refused to publish the findings. Now the MRC is said to be showing interest in the planned clinical trial, which Prof Nutt believes could be undertaken this year with sufficient backing. Twenty six patients with a history of serious depression which cannot be treated with drugs or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are expected to take part. Half will be treated with psilocybin while trained psychotherapists prompt them to recollect happy memories and think positively. Findings from the earlier research suggest the positive effects of the drug might be long-lasting, or even permanent. After the treatment, the patients’ progress will be monitored for a year. Their responses will be compared with those of a 'placebo group' of another 13 patients given infusions of a salt solution containing no psilocybin.","Twenty six patients with a history of serious depression to take part in a trial .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Tea Party Senator Ted Cruz claimed his first victory in the battle to control the Republican Party on Tuesday night when his two candidates in Nebraska won their primary elections. Cruz endorsed gubernatorial candidate Pete Ricketts and Senate candidate Ben Sasse won their respective primary races, positioning Cruz as kingmaker in November. 'Ben . Sasse’s decisive victory in Nebraska tonight is a clear indication that . the grassroots are rising up to Make DC Listen. They’re rising up to . take our country back,' Cruz posted to his Facebook. Ted Cruz, left, campaigns in Omaha, Nebraska, on Friday, May 9, for Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Ricketts, right. Ricketts won the party's nomination in last night's primary . Cruz won his own Senate primary in 2012 after being endorsed by then-Senator Jim DeMint, the upper chamber's resident kingmaker at the time. DeMint left the Senate to run conservative non-profit The Heritage Foundation just as Cruz was taking office, and Cruz has since sought to fill his mentor's shoes. The former Texas solicitor general is only in his second year as a U.S. Senator, yet he is already considered a Tea Party leader and a likely 2016 presidential candidate. After making his maiden speech on the Senate floor during frenemie Rand Paul's filibuster of the Obama administration's drone policy in March 2013, Cruz held a talkathon of his own in October over Obamacare. During the 21-hour speech that resulted in a 16 day government shutdown, Cruz quoted Ayn Rand, Ashton Kutcher, Dr. Seuss, Duck Dynasty, Toby Keith and tried to 'make DC listen' to the problems Obamacare has caused average Americans. The speech, while not technically a filibuster, was the fourth longest speech in U.S. Senate history, and it propelled him to the finalist list for Time Magazine's Person of the Year. Cruz ended up losing the award to Pope Francis, but his selection for the short-list showed that not only was DC listening to him, the whole country was. Republican gubernatorial nominee Pete Ricketts, left, and Republican Senate nominee Ben Sasse shake hands in Lincoln, Nebraska during a unity rally after Nebraska's primary election last night . In a CNN presidential poll released last week, Cruz landed in the middle of the pack, trailing Paul by six points and beating fellow Tea Party Senator Marco Rubio by only a single digit. So far Cruz has farer better than Paul in the endorsement race, however. Paul's Senate candidate in North Carolina lost to House Speaker Thom Tillis in last week's GOP primary. Rubio has not made any endorsements this election cycle. In Nebraska, Cruz's Senate candidate Ben Sasse, a university president, sailed to victory, winning 49 percent of the vote and beating out establishment candidate and former state treasurer Shane Osborn as well as self-funder and Pinnicle Bank president Sid Dinsdale. Sasse is the favorite to win the general election against Democratic candidate David Domina,a trial attorney. A Magellen Strategies poll taken last week had Sasse beating Domina by double digits - and that was with Osborn still on the ballot. 'We urgently need conservative . reinforcements in the Senate like Ben who will stand with the American . people, not the Washington establishment,' Cruz said of Sasse after his win on Tuesday. 'Ben is a . constitutional conservative who will not just “check the box” and vote . the right way. He’ll affirmatively fight to advance the conservative . agenda, repeal Obamacare, and defend the Constitution.' Cruz's gubernatorial candidate Pete Ricketts pulled out a close win over over Attorney General Jon Bruning with 26.3 percent of the vote to Bruning's 25.6 percent. Ricketts is the son of Chicago Cubs owner and TD Ameritrade founder Joseph Ricketts. Rickets will square off against Democratic candidate Chuck Hassebrook in November and is expected to win. 'Pete . Ricketts is not a career politician – he’s an outsider who fights for . conservative values,' Cruz wrote on his Facebook, adding that Ricketts understands that without onerous government regulations, 'individual spirit will flourish.' Cruz's success rate at hand picking winners and losers will have little effect on his presidential aspirations. It will affect how much power he has withing the Republican caucus on the Hill, however. If Cruz - the vice chair of the Senate Republicans' political arm - is able to build up the number of Senators who share his way of thinking, it will be more difficult for others in the Republican caucus who disagree with his approach to government to stand in his way. Last fall's government shutdown could be the first of many heavy handed tactics Republicans use in the Senate to fight Democrats' agenda if Cruz takes the reins. Cruz faces his next test in the form of Oklahoma Senate candidate T.W. Shannon. Shannon, who is of Native American and African-American descent, is a representative in Oklahoma's state house. He is hoping to replace retiring Republican Senator Tom Coburn in the U.S. Senate. 'T.W. Shannon is a strong Constitutional conservative who will fight . for individual liberty and help turn our country around,' Cruz said in a . statement endorsing Shannon in April. 'T.W. embodies the . American dream.' 'I’m proud to offer T.W. my enthusiastic endorsement . because not only will he vote the right way, but he’ll stand up and . fight with us in the Senate to stop President Obama’s assault on our . liberties and defend America’s founding principles.' Shannon faces Congressman James Lankford in the June 24 primary. Polls show Lankford, who is in his second term in the House of Representatives, leading Shannon by a large margin.","Ted Cruz has only been a Senator for a year and a half, but already he's seen as a Tea Party leader and a national political player .
If Cruz is able to add more Republicans to the Senate who share his way of thinking, last fall's government shutdown could be the first of a more heavy handed approach by the GOP to halt the presidents agenda ."
"By . Mark Duell . We’re used to seeing dramatic images of widespread flooding in Britain at the moment - but these photographs could lead us to believe one part of the country has been hit by a drought. The pictures taken in Sampford Peverell, Devon, show severe soil erosion on a steep field that was said to have contained too few crops prior to the heavy winter rain. Images of the eroded landscape near Tiverton - with gullies around 5ft deep - were taken yesterday by local photographer Martin Hughes-Jones.

There are five types of topsoil erosion caused by water, but gully erosion is believed to have occurred in this case. This is when water erodes soil to form channels deeper than 1ft. These gullies start when fast-flowing runoff water hits a ‘nick’ point such as a rabbit burrow, or bare soil - and the water then scours away the soil. It often happens on cleared soils with little vegetation. It comes as thousands of homes were left without power last night as trains were cancelled and forecasters warned of battering winds and flooding. The Environment Agency issued three severe flood warnings in the South West. There were 67 flood warnings and 213 flood alerts also in place.

"By . Steve Robson . Thousands of homeowners are facing a huge increase in their mortgage repayments after the Bank of Ireland doubled rates overnight. Borrowers are being urged to complain to the bank and the Financial Ombudsman after the move which comes despite the Bank of England base rate remaining at a historic low of 0.5%. Consumer group Which? says the change, which will affect some 13,500 UK customers, is 'wholly unfair'. Thousands of homeowners are being affected by the Bank of Ireland's decision to increase mortgage rates . The Bank of Ireland (BOI) has been contacting those affected - most of whom have a buy-to-let loan - about the changes, which take affect from today. But consumer group Which? believes they are being treated unfairly, pointing out that some were sold a 'lifetime tracker'. It says customers should complain to the bank and if they are not happy with the response take the matter to the Financial Ombudsman. Which? accuses BOI of justifying the changes on the basis of 'clauses buried in the small print of mortgages' which were taken out before October 2004. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said this was 'wholly unfair' and said BOI was 'taking advantage of its customers by hiking rates at a time when the base rate is static'. He added: 'Customers should complain if they were led to believe they had bought a 'lifetime' mortgage and Bank of Ireland must deal with these complaints quickly and fairly.' Mr Lloyd urged the Financial Conduct Authority to ensure that all banks communicated important clauses to their mortgage customers and called for better protection for homeowners in consumer legislation. Some homeowners will see their repayments double overnight, despite the Bank of England base rate remaining at a historic low of 0.5% . A typical change will see a buy-to-let mortgage holder who is currently on a rate of 2.25% - made up of the base rate plus 1.75% - see it rise to 4.99% from today, representing the Bank rate plus 4.49%. For residential customers, changes will be introduced in two stages. From today, they will pay the Bank rate plus 2.49%. On October 1, it goes up to Bank rate plus 3.99% - currently 4.49%. One customer, Gary Smith, from Colchester, Essex, told the BBC he faced having to pay an extra £280 this month and a further £200 in October - after taking out a £200,000 mortgage with Bristol and West (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland) in 2004. He said: 'It was sold and marketed as a tracker rate. I thought I had that margin for life. It's all very frustrating.' BOI blames the rise on increase funding costs and the need for banks to maintain greater levels of capital. It has set up a phone line for anyone worried about the impact of the changes. The changes affect seven per cent of BOI's UK mortgage customers, the lender has said. The bank said: 'This increase is permitted by a specific clause in these mortgage contracts, which allows an increase in the interest rate differential after the guarantee period (i.e. after 31 December 2006). 'This clause was clearly referenced in the pre-sale offer document provided to the customer and the customer's intermediary prior to completion.' It said customers were free to move to other providers and no early repayment charges would apply. However tightened mortgage criteria and falling house prices may mean some struggling to find new deals. The rate increases do not affect customers who have taken out a mortgage through the Post Office, which has a financial partnership with the bank.","Huge hike despite Bank of England base rate at historic low of 0.5% .

"By . Emily Allen . Created: . 04:58 EST, 8 October 2011 . Britain is just weeks away from being in the grip of temperatures as low as -20C, forecasters have predicted. Parts of Britain already saw snow this week, with two inches falling in the Cairngorms in Scotland. The rest of Britain is being warned to brace itself for wintry conditions and falling snow from the beginning of November. And it looks like the colder weather is already on its way - as temperatures today plunged in certain areas to just 8C - a staggering 21.5C below last weekend's record highs - with the wind chill making it feel decidedly colder. Big freeze: Cars battle snowy weather in December last year . In central London today readings of 13C were recorded, in Macduff, Aberdeenshire, the mercury plummeted to 8C, while Plymouth, in Devon, was comparatively basking in 16C of heat. The warning of freezing weather comes as a survey from council . leaders reveals local authorities are stockpiling thousands of tonnes of . extra road salt this year in anticipation of another white winter. James Madden, long-range forecaster for Exacta Weather, said: 'I expect the most frequent and heavy snowfalls to occur across many parts of the UK during November, December and January at present. 'I initially expect frequent and significant snowfalls across many northern regions and Scotland throughout this winter. 'Any earlier snowfall is likely to be more confined to northern and western parts of the UK, although large scale low pressure systems also offer the potential for significant snowfalls to many parts of the UK. 'I also expect November, December, January and February to feature largely below-average temperatures across many parts of the UK, it is likely that temperature and snowfall records will be broken within this defined time frame.' Parts of Britain already saw snow this week, with two inches falling in the Cairngorms in Scotland, pictured . Workers shovel road salt at the London Strategic Salt Reserve last year. Each council spread about 3,900 tonnes of salt, on average, while this year councils have stockpiled about 4,900 tones . Some shops are already planning ahead for the bad weather. Halfords has ordered in 10,000 plastic sledges in anticipation of the big freeze. Research by the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents more than 350 councils in England and Wales, shows on average local authorities aim to have 1,500 tonnes more salt at the ready to treat roads and pavements than they did at the start of October 2010. Each council spread about 3,900 tonnes of salt, on average, last year, while this year councils are armed with about 4,900 tonnes. In total, an estimated 1.4million tonnes of salt is expected to be stockpiled this year. Many authorities faced criticism last winter as the nation's motorists battled dangerous roads caused by freezing temperatures, many becoming stranded. Ready for winter: Nicola Toulson who works at Halfords with the delivery of the bright blue sleds . Thousands of roads were left untreated as salt stocks plummeted and councils were forced to prioritise. Cllr Peter Box, Chairman of the Local . Government Association's Economy and Transport Board, said: 'Councils . have a huge and important role to play in keeping the country running . and know there is no room for complacency. 'Treating . the roads means children can still get to school safely, their parents . can get to work, care workers can reach those in need, ambulances and . police can tend to emergencies, and the wheels of business don't grind . to a halt. 'Local . authorities have been hard at work making preparations for this winter . ever since the end of the last one and keeping the roads open will be . our number one priority. 'This . year councils have more salt and better plans in place to make it go . further while even more volunteers and community groups have been lined . up to help with the great gritting effort.' The Met Office is forecasting cloudy and cool weather today with some rain. Highs of 15C are anticipated in the west country with lows of 9C in parts of Scotland. Outbreaks of rain are expected across the majority of the country tomorrow and into Monday.","1.4million tonnes of salt has been ordered this year .

"By . Associated Press . Thousands of people expressing grief, anger and hope for a better future marched through Staten Island on Saturday to protest the chokehold death of an unarmed black man by a white police officer. The afternoon rally and march was led by the Rev. Al Sharpton and relatives of Eric Garner, who died July 17 after a New York Police Department officer took him to the ground with a banned tactic captured on a widely circulated video. The marchers, starting at the intersection where Garner was first confronted, walked behind a banner that said: 'We Will Not Go Back, March for Justice.' Scroll down for video .

Many protesters were photographed carrying signs at the Saturday rally . Police estimated that 2,500 people had taken to the streets. James O'Neill, chief of patrol with the NYPD, credited the march organizers with helping to keep things orderly.  'Everything is good,' he said. Earlier, Sharpton urged about 100 marchers gathered at a Staten Island church to remain nonviolent or go home. He also repeated his call for a federal takeover of the criminal probe into the death of the 43-year-old Garner, an asthmatic father of six who was placed in a chokehold after police officers stopped him for selling loose cigarettes. Activists have urged that criminal charges be brought against the officers involved. Together: The Rev. Al Sharpton, center, holds hands with former New York Gov.

Saturday's half-mile-long route wound through a heavily minority neighborhood, one of several in the nation's largest city where residents have said they feel unfairly targeted by police for suspicion of crime and enforcement of low-level offenses . Many in the crowd carried signs. Some said: 'Police the NYPD' or 'RIP Eric Garner.' But the most popular signs were 'Hands Up, Don't Shoot,' which emerged during protests in Missouri over the police killing of Michael Brown, and 'I can't breathe,' Garner's last words. Garner's widow, Esaw, urged the crowd to march in peace toward justice. She said she is too afraid to let her sons go outside and asked those at the rally to 'get justice' for her husband. The marchers walked alongside dozens of police officers in parade gear, including polo shirts and pants. There were also officers in formal blue uniforms, but none had riot gear. The rally proceeded past the office of Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan, who this week sent the case to a grand jury. Several protesters were photographed by Reuters standing at the site of the incident between police officers and Eric Garner . Sharpton has repeatedly called Garner's death - and the shooting death of the 18-year-old Brown by police in Ferguson, Missouri - a 'defining moment' for policing nationwide . Demonstrators: Mary Thurman, center, chants the march . Sharpton has repeatedly called Garner's death — and the shooting death of the 18-year-old Brown by police in Ferguson, Missouri — a 'defining moment' for policing nationwide. Members of both Garner's and Brown's family were invited to the march. Garner, an asthmatic father of six, was unarmed when he was stopped July 17. Garner was placed in a chokehold — an illegal police tactic — and could be heard screaming 'I can't breathe!' as he was forced to the ground. Soon after, he was declared dead. The city medical examiner ruled the death a homicide and two NYPD officers have been reassigned during the investigation. So far, the U.S. Justice Department has signaled it likely will wait for the local probe to conclude before deciding whether to launch a formal civil rights investigation. Saturday's half-mile-long route wound through a heavily minority neighborhood, one of several in the nation's largest city where residents have said they feel unfairly targeted by police for suspicion of crime and enforcement of low-level offenses.","The afternoon rally and march was led by .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Stephen McLaughlin, 34, of Londonderry, Northern Ireland, has been charged with conspiring to facilitate illegal entry into the UK . Two lorry drivers have been remanded in custody following the death of a suspected illegal immigrant found in a shipping container at Tilbury Docks. Stephen McLaughlin, 34, of Limavady, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, and Timothy Murphy, 33 of Elmgrove, Londonderry, were both charged with conspiring to facilitate illegal entry into the UK. The pair made a appearance at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court today, both speaking only to confirm their name, date of birth and personal details from the dock. The court heard that between August 1 and 17, the pair conspired to 'clandestinely convey 35 Afghan nationals by sea in to an English port, which facilitated the commission of a breach of immigration law'. Meet Singh Kapoor, 40, from Afghanistan, was found dead inside the container at the Essex port on August 16. Father-of-two Mr Kapoor was among a group of 35 immigrants, including 13 children, who were discovered on a freight ferry. They were rescued at about 6.30am last Saturday when staff heard screaming and banging coming from the 40ft container, labelled Hudig & Kersten, which had arrived on a P&O vessel from Zeebrugge, northern Belgium. The group is believed to have been part of a tiny Sikh minority in Afghanistan and fled after suffering persecution. After being freed, the survivors said that they feared they were 20 minutes from death and were drifting in and out of consciousness. They were treated in local hospitals following the incident and survived the ordeal. They are in the process of claiming asylum in the UK after travelling to Europe in a lorry before reportedly spending 18 hours in the cargo container en route to the UK. The ages of those in the container ranged from one to 72. Essex Police said a post-mortem examination on Mr Kapoor had failed to establish the cause of his death and inquiries are continuing. McLaughlin and Murphy will appear via video-link for a hearing at Basildon Crown Court at a date to be set during the week beginning November 17. The pair were arrested after a group of 35 suspected illegal immigrants were found in this shipping container at Tilbury Docks, Essex, which was unloaded off a freight ferry that had arrived from Zeebrugge, Belgium .

"By . Louise Eccles for the Daily Mail . Loyal British Telecom customers face inflation-busting price rises because of the firm’s £1.6billion splurge on football rights, campaigners claimed last night. Line rental, call charges and broadband bills are to jump by at least 6 per cent from December. Charities say the elderly, many of whom regard their home phones as a lifeline, will be the hardest hit. Hardest hit: Elderly people who rely on their land line will be the worst hit by the line rental price hikes . BT paid £897million in November for a three-year Champions League broadcasting deal, which starts next year. It was already paying £738million for Premier League games in an attempt to break Sky’s dominance of televised top-flight football. Lisa Harris, of the over-50s group Saga, said: ‘As BT announces multi-million pound football rights deals, it will be difficult for those already struggling to make ends meet to understand why they are subject to above inflation price increases. ‘For many older people the telephone and internet is their lifeline. ‘Increasing prices way in excess of inflation risks more older people becoming socially isolated for fear of using their phone or internet to keep in touch with friends and family members. 'Older consumers have already seen their cost of living rise significantly faster than the population as a whole since 2007, and this adds further pressure to their already stretched budgets.’ Around ten million BT customers will be affected by the changes to line rental charges. These include seven million broadband customers, who automatically have line rental as part of their package. Gillian Guy of Citizens Advice said: ‘Even a small increase in phone and broadband bills could have a big impact on family finances. ‘In the past 12 months, Citizens Advice has dealt with more than 62,000 telephone and broadband debt problems. 'Many standard television, broadband and phone packages come as bundles which can make it hard for consumers to spot price rises.’ BT denied that it had raised prices in order to cover the cost of its investment in sports rights. A spokesman said: ‘Our price changes are not associated with BT Sport. Changes: Prices will rocket after BT signed another multi-million deal in a bid to break Sky's dominance . 'We make major investments in equipment, services and technology all the time – and we’ve invested more in superfast broadband than sports rights.’ BT said its rivals – including TalkTalk, Virgin Media and Sky – had also increased their charges. It launched BT Sport – a package of pay-for television channels – to much fanfare last August. Viewing figures were initially disappointing with some shows being watched by just 1,200 viewers. But last month BT claimed its Premier League offering was paying off with broadband and TV revenues up by a quarter. The telecoms giant said it had added a net 104,000 broadband customers in the three months to the end of June, beating Sky. In December, the price of standard line rental for direct debit customers will rise by £1 to £16.99. The pence per minute rate for calls to UK landlines and 0870 numbers will go up from 9p a minute to 9.58p. The set-up fee for landline calls, which is charged as soon as the call is connected, will increase from 15p to 15.97p and call return will increase from 19.9p to 21.19p. Broadband prices are going up by as much as 6.5 per cent.","Line rental, call charges and broadband bills to jump 6% from December .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail online Deputy Political Editor . A film portraying Nick Clegg’s role in the creation of the first Coalition government since the Second World War has been announced – sparking ridicule in Westminster. The one-off Channel 4 programme – quickly dubbed ‘Nick Clegg the movie’ – will be set in the days following the 2010 election when backroom deals helped shut Labour out of power for the first time since 1997. The revelation sparked speculation in Westminster over which Hollywood actor would play Mr Clegg - a former university Thespian himself – and his glamorous Spanish wife Miriam. Scroll down for video . Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg - pictured at the Merlin Theatre, Nether Edge, in 2006 - took a leading role in the panto Sleeping Beauty, playing the Prince. He is seen with Rivka Smith who plays Sleeping Beauty . A Lib Dem source close to the Deputy Prime Minister suggested there was already one superstar in the running. The source said: ‘That would explain why Johnny Depp has been calling.’ The Spanish actress Penelope Cruz was also suggested as a leading contender to play Miriam. But Mr Clegg may fancy a go playing himself in the movie. He once played the prince in an amateur pantomime of Sleeping Beauty at university. Mr Clegg has previously boasted about his days as a wannabe actor. He said: 'Acting was a great love of mine and I never would have caught the idea of drama unless I'd been encouraged to do so in school.' Speaking to the acting magazine The Stage he added: 'When I was younger, I had the privilege of performing alongside others who have since gone on to lead very successful acting careers.' Mr Clegg also appeared in a Westminster School play with Helena Bonham Carter. A series of online spoofs were mocked up showing the Deputy Prime Minister in a series of famous films . The Lib Dem leader's role forming the Coalition was mocked  as the 'Greatest Story Ever Told' in one spoof film poster. Behind Mr Clegg the Spanish Hollywood star Penelope Cruz can be seen playing Miriam . Playwright James Graham, whose National Theatre play This House was set in the dying days of James Callaghan's Labour government, said Mr Clegg was pivotal in a ‘historic’ moment in British politics. He said: ‘In May 2010, British politics was faced with a dilemma it hadn't had to face in peacetime for over 75 years. ‘The public were asked “Who should govern?” and they came back with the answer “We don't know”. ‘Those historic, dramatic few days put personalities at the heart of politics - and the choices made, I believe, changed the face of British politics forever. ‘What we try to capture in this drama is the tension, the high stakes, and the frequent farcical and absurd nature of what happens when a power is wrangled, negotiated and fought over like children trading cards in the playground.’ The 90-minute film, with the working title ‘Coalition’, is the latest in a string of political dramas on the channel including the Bafta-winning Mo about Mo Mowlam and The Deal, which starred Michael Sheen and David Morrissey as Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The Lib Dems tonight asked on Twitter who should be chosen to play the Deputy Prime Minister. One mock up image on Twitter suggested Benedict Cumberbatch would be a good choice . Online spoof Twitter account 'General Boles' - a parody of the Tory MP Nick Boles - suggested the final scene of the Nick Clegg Movie would see him at the wheel of the Titanic . The channel is also making a 10-part spy drama - called Opposite Number - about agents fighting a secret war in the closed world of North Korea. Its writer, Matt Charman, said: ‘North Korea is one of the last truly impenetrable nations on the planet, and one of the most dangerous for the West. ‘I wanted to write a drama that could blow the lid off our understanding of who we think the North Korean people are and what their government truly wants.’","Film will portray Mr Clegg's role in the creation of the Coalition in 2010 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Adults are being urged to improve their maths as experts claim poor numeracy costs the economy more than £20billion a year. Inability to cope with numbers results in lower wages, smaller company profits and reduced tax revenues for the Government, a charity warns today. Millions of adults struggle with simple tasks they need in their jobs or everyday life, such as weighing ingredients, administering medicines and working out deals in shops, National Numeracy says. Now, the organisation is urging Britons to take a 20-minute maths quiz after figures showed half the adult population has the numeracy ability of a primary school child. They will be given a score and guided towards maths tuition to help them improve their result next time they take the challenge. The Government-backed scheme is aimed at boosting the maths skills of at least one million adults over the next five years. It coincided with new research from the Pro Bono Economics charity which pinpointed levels of poor numeracy and calculated the cost to the economy. Karen Hancock, an economist with the charity, said: ‘The report begins with the finding that almost half the adult population has numeracy no greater than that expected of a child leaving primary school. For a developed country that’s pretty shocking.’ Poor maths skills were estimated to be costing the economy £20.2billion-a-year - 1.3 per cent of GDP. In fact, this was likely to be an underestimate since costs to the criminal justice system and NHS were difficult to quantify. A separate poll of 2,300 adults found that more than a third - 36 per cent - felt they were being held back by their poor maths abilities, for example struggling to help with their children’s homework or trying to work out budgets and personal finances. One in four said maths at school did not prepare them well for maths in everyday life. A poll of 2,300 adults found that more than a third - 36 per cent - felt they were being held back by their poor maths abilities (library image) Under the new initiative, anyone can check their maths skills through a new online quiz at www.nnchallenge.org.uk . It takes 20 to 25 minutes and participants will be given a score out of 100 and one of four grades, with gold the top grade, meaning they are performing at GCSE C-grade level or above. Silver is equivalent to grades D to G at GCSE, bronze is equivalent to the standard expected of a nine to 11-year-old, while ‘entry’ is the standard expected of children up to the age of eight. Participants are then guided to free websites which will help them improve their skills at their own pace, before encouraging them to retake the test. Mike Ellicock, chief executive of National Numeracy, said: ‘We want this to be the biggest ever drive across the UK to crack the problem of poor adult numeracy, a problem that has dogged us for decades. ‘We’re heartened by the extent to which we’ve got support from the DfE, from Elizabeth Truss and Matt Hancock and the Department for Business.’ He said poor maths skills were not because Britons lacked innate talent but a prevailing assumption that you can either do maths or you can’t. It was ‘absolutely vital’ to explode what amounted to a ‘big talent myth’. A range of public sector organisations and firms are backing the scheme and encouraging employees to take the quiz, including Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, which described how it would help improve patient care. ‘If we can improve numeracy it will inevitably improve care for patients because so much of patient care is measured,’ said Paula Ward, assistant director of learning. Staff needed maths for a range of tasks such as calculating dose and meal portion sizes, translating easily between stones and kilograms when talking about patients’ weights and calculating the correct concentration of cleaning products to keep bugs under control. Mark Rennison, group finance director at Nationwide, which is backing the initiative, said: ‘We are confronted every day, through the distribution of financial products through our branch network with conversations with people who clearly are not comfortable [with numbers]. ‘It is almost impossible to ask people to make buying decisions around financial products without resorting to numbers.’","Many struggle with simple mathematical tasks, National Numeracy found .

"By . Adam Crafton for the Daily Mail . Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has revealed he never feared Liverpool would beat his side to the Barclays Premier League title last season. Ahead of Monday night’s clash at The Etihad the Chilean hinted Brendan Rodgers’ team struggled to handle the pressure as the finishing line moved into sight in May. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manuel Pellegrini: Liverpool is six-point match . Big game: Manuel Pellegrini appreciates the importance of the clash with Liverpool . Liverpool pulled clear at the top of the table in April after defeating City 3-2 at Anfield but, rather than glory, their season ended in tears and trauma. A costly slip from captain Steven Gerrard contributed to a home defeat by Chelsea and one week later they threw away a three-goal advantage at Selhurst Park to draw 3-3 with Crystal Palace. City, by contrast, won their final five matches to overcome their Merseyside rivals and lift the Premier League trophy. ‘I was not surprised,’ Pellegrini admitted. ‘I was absolutely convinced when I said the words that I said, “careful it’s not finished because they have to play four games more and the pressure when you are at the top of the table is increasing after every game”. Training days: Manchester City prepare for Monday night's match with Liverpool at the Etihad . Raring to go: Frank Lampard has been declared fit to play his part against Liverpool . ‘The most important thing for us was not to think about Liverpool but think about what we had to do. From my experience, when you are finishing the season the pressure increases every week for every team, not only for Liverpool. ‘That’s why I was absolutely sure they weren’t going to win the five games they had to play.’ Pellegrini, who described Monday’s clash as a ‘game of six points’, believes Liverpool will be a rather different proposition without Luis Suarez. He said: ‘It is so difficult to answer after just one game but maybe they will always miss Luis Suarez. He is a very important player but they have brought a lot of important new players and they continue to have a very strong squad.’ Pellegrini is considering handing Sergio Aguero a first start of the season after his goalscoring impact from the bench in the 2-0 win at Newcastle last weekend. Bosnian forward Edin Dzeko is expected to lead the line against Liverpool days after penning a new deal but £32million signing Eliaquim Mangala is not ready to feature after joining the club from Porto last week.

"By . Neil Ashton for The Mail on Sunday . From his seat just behind the dug-out, Teddy Sheringham saluted West Ham’s goalscorers one by one. All three had the seal of approval from the club’s new striker coach. Their finishes were straight out of the Sheringham locker, taking English football back to a time when he had the calmest finish in the game. He could make it look so easy. So did West Ham, strolling to victory at Selhurst Park with goals from Mauro Zarate, Stewart Downing and Carlton Cole. They were ruthless. Off to a bad start: Mauro Zarate made matters worse for manager-less Crystal Palace by giving West Ham the lead after 34 minutes . Celebration: Zarate got West Ham going at Crystal Palace on Saturday with the opening goal before Stewart Downing added a second three minutes later . Daylight between: Downing celebrates making it 2-0 just three minutes after West Ham took the lead at Selhurst Park against Crystal Palace . Crystal Palace XI: Speroni, Kelly, Hangeland, Delaney, Ward, Bannan (Williams 71), Jedinak, O'Keefe (Murray 83), Bolasie, Chamakh, Campbell (Gayle 70) Unused subs: Mariappa, McCarthy, Guedioura, Hennessey . Goals: Chamakh (48) West Ham XI: Adrian, O'Brien, Tomkins, Reid, Cresswell, Noble, Downing (Diame 90), Zarate (Poyet 83), Vaz Te, Cole (Sakho 68) Unused subs: Morrison, Demel, Jaaskelainen, Valencia . Goals: Zarate (34), Downing (37), Cole (62) Referee: Mark Clattenberg . ‘Knowing Teddy he will probably take all the credit,’ chuckled Sam Allardyce after his side registered their first Barclays Premier League win of the season. At times West Ham’s football was a sight to behold, with Mark Noble and the outstanding Cheikhou Kouyate zipping the ball into the feet of West Ham’s front line. It was irresistible to watch. Sheringham has been brought into provide some invention, that little bit of craft and guile to open up teams such as Crystal Palace. He was that type of player himself, always one step ahead of the game during a stellar career with some of the top teams in English football. Zarate’s opener was a beaut, picking a clearance out of the sky to volley West Ham ahead in the 34th minute. It was a special goal. So was Downing’s as he drifted in from the right, gliding past Palace’s defence and waited for the moment to bend an effort beyond Julian Speroni. They are goals worth watching again and again. ‘Teddy can do little things in groups and he has definitely added something,’ admitted Allardyce. ‘The only problem we have is the sports scientists saying he is out there too long with them: “Don’t get an injury or the muscles will tighten up...” ‘But I don’t mind him taking all the credit for it if we continue to show the quality of finishes we did against Palace.’ West Ham were ruthless. In a short space of time Sheringham has added another dimension to Allardyce’s attack, drawing on the creative juices of Downing, Zarate and Ricardo Vaz Te. They needed it after last season, when the fans were on Allardyce’s back for 38 games and wanted him out of Upton Park. But West Ham had something about them yesterday, purring when they were in possession and always threatening around the edges of the penalty area. Making his point: Teddy Sheringham watched on as his strikers put Crystal Palace to the sword in the comfortable win at Selhurst Park . Decisions: Crystal Palace co-owner Steve Parish must choose his new manager after Tony Pulis's departure and caretaker manager Keith Millen (right) is in the running . Coming out: The teams emerge for the start of play on Saturday at Selhurst Park with the Crystal Palace home fans looking to give their side a bost . Battle: Barry Bannan and Ricardo Vaz Te go for the ball during the 3-1 loss for Crystal Palace on Saturday at Selhurst Park . CLICK HERE TO VISIT OUR MATCH ZONE FOR ALL THE HEAT MAPS AND STATISTICS . This was poor from Palace, a world away from the team that Tony Pulis built and took to 11th place in the Premier League last season. The worry for interim manager Keith Millen is that West Ham didn’t have to work too hard for this. ‘We were lacklustre,’ he admitted. Yet he deserved better than this from his players. Sure they are lacking direction and leadership while the club continue their search for a new manager, but losing Pulis is no longer an excuse. It is time to move on. ‘It has been a tough week for the club because we lost Tony in the circumstances we did and then everything happened with Malky [Mackay],’ Millen added. Millen still wants the job full-time and he is due to speak with co-chairman Steve Parish today. Whatever happens, he will take the team to Walsall for Tuesday’s Capital One Cup tie. He was encouraged, in part, by Palace’s start to the second half, but all the effort and commitment was shortlived. With those Palace fanatics in the Holmesdale Road demanding more, Marouane Chamakh unexpectedly dragged them back into it with a smart goal. Barry Bannan, who had a decent game in Palace’s midfield, sent the ball down the line for Mile Jedinak to steer in the direction of Chamakh. When it arrived the Moroccan took a touch before drilling an effort that evaded the outstretched hand of West Ham keeper Adrian. Given hope: Striker Marouane Chamakh got Palace back in the running with a second-half strike that made it 2-1 to the visitors . In: Chamakh of Palace scores during the Premier League match against West Ham at Selhurst Park to give caretaker manager Millen hope of nicking a point . Back in it: Palace edged their way back into the game to make it 2-1 with more than 40 minutes left to play but could not inspire a full comeback . It is a shame then that Palace sat back, inviting pressure and giving West Ham the chance to finish it off. They accepted, gratefully. Cole had done well against Palace’s defence and his 62nd-minute goal from close range was a reward for his endeavours. This time it was route one, a free-kick launched from West Ham’s half that Palace defender Damien Delaney failed to adequately clear. Cole reacted first to beat Speroni with an emphatic strike. ‘Everything is going against us at the moment, but this just wasn’t good enough,’ admitted Millen. ‘Until you come to matchday, you never quite know what kind of reaction you will get from your players.’ On Saturday, in his second game in charge since Pulis left, it was nowhere near good enough. Settling it: Carlton Cole makes it 3-1 to West Ham against a Palace side whose manager left less than 48 hours before the Premier League season started . That'll do it: Cole slots past Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni to make it 3-1 on Saturday afternoon at Selhurst Park . Are you not entertained?

The proposed option will mean children can still be vaccinated free of charge when seeing a bulk-billing doctor. The decision was put forward after the Abbott government struggled to win the necessary support since the much maligned Budget was delivered by Treasurer Joe Hockey back in May.

The compromise deal is a bid to gain support from crossbenchers who said they would not back the measure. It's was revealed by the Labor party that the government's planned $7 GP co-payment and a $5 increase to every PBS script for workers will cost each Australian $300 over the next four years, reported the Daily Telegraph. Other options reportedly being examined include exemptions for the elderly and a fee reduction for pensioners.

A school which radically changed its learning hours, sending students home at lunchtime 'to capture their peak learning time' has reported amazing results. Merrylands East Primary School (MEPS) in Sydney's western suburbs begins its classes at 8am and has back-to-back classes, plus a 30-minute break, until 1.15pm. The Queensland University of Technology conducted a two-year study and found the restructured day has had 'a tremendous impact'. Merrylands East Primary School John Goh has won a scholarship to attend a Harvard leadership school for his groundbreaking approach to education . 'They particularly found that the engagement has risen in the boys and is consistent for the girls,' Principal John Goh told Radio National, adding students were more engaged and found learning more enjoyable. A homework centre operates from 1.15pm to 3pm to help working parents. Mr Goh also introduced new classroom layouts and increased the use of technology. 'We have minimal furniture. Not every child has a chair or a table because we know children don't always learn best at a desk,' he said. The furniture includes round tables, booths and bean bags to allow for a range of different work behaviours. Queensland University of Technology's Professor Linda Graham said: The teachers report far fewer kids getting into trouble due to lunchtime argy-bargy and they are not tired and emotional in that relatively useless last session of the day. 'The children have more time to play and be with their family.' Mr Goh, the principal, demonstrating the school's unique classroom layout and their implementation of technology and laptops into their curriculum. Senior teacher Solange Cruz told The Daily Telegraph the hour after lunch was a 'wasted' period. '(With an 8am start time) the kids are fresher, they come to school on time and they are busy right away,' she said. 'The hour after lunch used to be a wasted hour but now the kids are doing maths and English all the way through to 1.15pm and they are no longer exhausted. Mr Goh added: 'Along with changing school times we have changed the way that we have been teaching the children. We've been doing some really exciting things with technology with our children. '(The students are studying) 3D printing, website design and phone apps. Years one and two each have their own laptops.' Children are given options in their learning space, with the choice to sit at benches, round tables, plush seating and bean bags. The young children pictured learning with the laptops . Mr Goh says that the students are indicating that they are developing a genuine love of education, by being involved in the groundbreaking approach to education. Suallyn Mitchelmore, an academic in the field of Early Childhood Education, says it is time for school systems to embrace change and turn to research to make decisions that are best for the children. 'The framework for school systems has not changed since its inception post the industrial revolution. 'It's about time schools met children's needs. Children have always had to 'get ready for school,' rather than the schools getting ready for the children. 'If the research says that 8am-1pm is the optimal time for learning then surely this is a good thing.'","Sydney primary school runs from 8am to 1.15pm: kids go home at lunchtime .

"By . Michael Powell for The Mail on Sunday . and Peter Henn . A murder investigation was launched last night after a man was found dead in a shipping container crammed with 35 people, including women and young children – innocent victims of criminal gangs who traffic migrants across continents. Workers at Tilbury Docks in Essex raised the alarm yesterday morning after hearing desperate cries for help from the sealed container, which had arrived on a P&O cargo ferry from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. Those trapped inside were screaming and banging on the sides of the box as their oxygen supply began to run out. Scroll down for video . Police have launched a murder investigation after today after 35 people were found locked inside a shipping container, leading to one of them dying . Workers at Tilbury Docks in Essex discovered the group of 35 illegal immigrants when they heard 'screaming and banging' coming from inside a container on this vessel . The P&O commercial ferry - called the Norstream - left Zeebrugge in Belgium at 10pm on Friday night and arrived in the Essex docks at 6am on Saturday morning . Exhausted, severely dehydrated and suffering from hypothermia, they were taken to three hospitals in Essex and East London as police launched a major inquiry to track down the callous people-smugglers who had brought them to the UK in such shocking circumstances. All the stowaways are thought to be Punjabis from the Indian subcontinent. They included seven young children who last night were recovering from their ordeal. But one man failed to survive. Police said he was found dead when emergency workers forced their way inside the container. Describing the appalling conditions inside the container, Superintendent Trevor Roe, of Essex Police, who is heading the investigation, said: ‘They had obviously been in there a significant amount of time. ‘They were suffering from hypothermia and dehydration. One person had died within the container – that gives you an indication of what the conditions were like.’ Detectives declined to say where the migrants had started their journey on the grounds that releasing the information might compromise their inquiry into what they described as a human-trafficking incident. The container had been loaded from a lorry on to P&O’s Norstream ferry at Zeebrugge on Friday night.The ship arrived at Tilbury just after 5am yesterday and the alarm was raised nearly an hour and a half later when the desperate pleas for help were heard. An immediate search was ordered of the other 50 containers on the ferry in case any more victims were trapped. One dock worker, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It’s an absolute tragedy. I feel for the guys who discovered it too. That’s got to be hard to see.’ Paramedics were on the scene within 11 minutes of the alarm first being raised and the authorities declared it a major incident. All the survivors were conscious when the container was opened. They were treated for severe dehydration and hypothermia. Their conditions were said not to be life-threatening. Daniel Gore, assistant chief officer of the East of England Ambulance Service, admitted the first paramedics to reach the dockside had encountered a ‘very difficult scene’. Supt Roe added: ‘Staff here at the port became aware of screaming and banging from a container coming from that particular ferry. The A&E department at Basildon University Hospital was sealed off by police as a 'decontamination area' An aerial image shows the emergency services at the scene in Tilbury Docks, Essex . Officers were called after the group were discovered when the vessel was being unloaded . ‘As a result of that noise, staff were alerted and immediately breached the container to find 35 persons within that unit. ‘It is a homicide investigation. We will be looking to see what gangs may be involved in this conspiracy to bring these people in this way over to this country. Clearly we need to try to bring them to justice.’ Supt Roe said possible charges could include murder and manslaughter, although there was no suggestion anyone from the container was a suspect. He added: ‘All of the victims – and I will call them victims – are recovering fairly quickly in most cases, and are obviously being detained under immigration powers. They will be taken to a reception centre within the port of Tilbury.’ Eighteen survivors – two in a serious but stable condition – were taken to Basildon Hospital, where a decontamination area was set up. Mr Gore described the move as a precaution and said there were no specific concerns over infectious diseases. A further nine went to Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, and seven to Southend Hospital. Last night one member of the group was discharged from hospital and was taken to a reception centre for further questioning as interpreters were brought in to help communication with the stowaways. The group were admitted to three nearby university hospitals, including Basildon University Hospital, where they were treated for dehydration and hypothermia . A P&O spokesman said the Norstream was carrying more than 50 containers, 72 trailers and five lorries plus their drivers on the crossing from Belgium. Essex Police were last night liaising with colleagues in Belgium to try to find the lorry driver who had driven the container to Belgium. Belgian police believe images of the lorry have been captured on CCTV. They do not, however, have any information yet about where the vehicle began its journey. One of the largest Indian communities in Britain is from the Punjab region and nearly all the 500,000 Sikhs living in the UK are from that part of the subcontinent. Many have settled in the Southall area of West London but there are also large communities in Birmingham and Wolverhampton.

Superintendent Trevor Roe  from Essex Police (left) and Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer Daniel Gore from East of England  Ambulance Service (right) address the media at a press conference . An ambulance enters Tilbury Docks to attend the 'major incident' which was reported when the container was discovered on Saturday morning . Police have set up a telephone hotline for anyone concerned about relatives. The numbers are 0800 056 0944 or 020 7158 0010 if dialling from abroad. The 20,000-ton Norstream, which was built in 1999 and is registered in the Netherlands, makes the North Sea crossing from Zeebrugge to Tilbury twice a day. The Thames estuary port is primarily a bulk cargo and container destination and not normally a prime target for illegal migrants. The case has chilling echoes of an incident in 2000 when 58 Chinese men and women were found suffocated in a lorry that had arrived in Dover from Calais. A year later, eight illegal migrants died in a shipping container which had been unloaded at an industrial estate in Wexford in Ireland after a crossing from Zeebrugge. A Serbian people-trafficker was later convicted of their manslaughter and sentenced to ten years in prison.","Thirty five people, believed to be victims of people trafficking, were found locked inside shipping container yesterday .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Facebook users have responded in their thousands after a lawsuit was set up to challenge the social network over its privacy controls. A total of 25,000 people signed up to Europe versus Facebook class suit, set up by Austrian student Max Schrems last week. Mr Schrems is demanding damages of €500 (£397) per supporter for alleged data protection violations - and if successful it could cost Facebook at least €12.5 million (£10 million). A total of 25,000 people have signed up to Facebook class suit, set up by Austrian student Max Schrems last week. It is claiming Facebook violates data protection laws through features including Graph Search (pictured). This feature lets users discover information about other member's likes and activities . The suit has been billed as a ‘David and Goliath lawsuit’ and it could ultimately . be the largest class and privacy action ever taken in Europe. The allegations centre around three main concerns including: . Facebook's Graph Search - this feature lets users discover information . about other member's likes and activities. External website tracking - Facebook monitors Likes on other sites through embedded buttons. Big data analysis - the social network analyses interactions to learn about member behaviours. Graph Search was launched in July 2013 and appears as a bigger search bar at the top of each page. It lets users find people who like cycling in London, for example, or which 18-year-olds in San Francisco are interested in horror films. When a user searches for something, that . search not only determines the set of results they get, but also serves . as a title for the page. Graph search uses the same privacy settings as a user's normal profile. Mr Schrems said he limited the campaign to 25,000 people because each claim has to be properly vetted, but admitted the actual figure exceeded this. ‘We are only claiming a small amount, as our primary objective is to ensure correct data protection,’ Mr Schrems said. The allegations centre around three main concerns. These include Facebook's Graph Search, which lets users discover information about other member's likes and activities, external website tracking, which monitors Likes on other sites, and big data analysis, which analyses interactions between members. The lawsuit is being taken in the Commercial Court in Vienna against the Irish subsidiary of the New York-listed web giant. Mr Schrems is moving his Europe-V-Facebook.org campaign from complaints to the Data Protection Commission in Ireland, to the courts in his homeland, as European consumer law allows complainants to take legal action where they live. The privacy activist has more than 20 complaints of alleged data breaches involving Facebook filed with the Irish data watchdog already. The class action in Vienna claims Facebook Ireland is in breach of European law on users' data, and that it violates rights by tracking internet use on external sites including the use of ‘Like’ buttons. Law student Mr Schrems  is claiming damages of . €500 (£397) per supporter for the alleged violations, billed . as a ‘David and Goliath lawsuit’. He said he limited the campaign to 25,000 people because each claim has to be properly vetted, but admitted the actual figure exceeded this . The lawsuit is being taken in the Commercial Court in Vienna against the Irish subsidiary of the New York-listed web giant. Therefore, it only applies to users who have a contract with Facebook Ireland and is not available to users in the US and Canada. It could end up costing Facebook at least €12.5 million (£10 million) Mr Schrems additionally criticised the company for allegedly supporting the US Prism surveillance programme - the National Security Agency's secret monitoring and data mining exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. An earlier landmark battle, launched in Ireland to find out what Facebook tells US spy chiefs, was referred to the European Court of Justice by a judge in Dublin last month. Facebook declined to comment. Mr Schrems said he is the only claimant under the Austrian legal system, but the action is being financed entirely by Roland ProzessFinanz AG. If successful, Roland will receive 20 per cent of the damages for putting up the funding. Mr Schrems added: ‘We love to complain constantly about data protection problems in Europe, now it's also time for us to enforce our fundamental rights. ‘In the beginning we made great progress in Ireland. As a result of our complaints, Facebook had to delete data and deactivate its facial recognition all over the world.’","The lawsuit is being taken in the Commercial Court in Vienna against the Irish subsidiary of the web giant .

A man duped a famous glamour model into stripping off for the camera by falsely offering her a spread in men's magazine Loaded, a court heard today. Naushad Faruk, 32, convinced the 26-year-old to pose for pictures on the promise of a feature in Loaded, Highbury Corner Magistrates Court was told. Faruk had no links with Loaded but had created a fake email address to keep up the pretence, it was claimed. A stylist was also lured to the shoot, which is said to have taken place at a plush flat in London’s Mayfair district in February of this year, the court heard. Faruk also secretly taped women performing sex acts on him on a secret camera hidden in his watch, it was claimed. Wearing a goatee beard and his hair in a slicked-back pony tail, Faruk denied the charges through his advocate, Sarah-Jane Connolly. Prosecutor Priya Valentine said: ‘It is said he purported to be a member of staff employed by the magazine Loaded, which, I understand, is a mens’ magazine. ‘He has then set up a false email address and through that he has arranged the photo shoot with the two complainants.’ ‘They took part in the photo shoot because they thought they would have a spread in the magazine.’ Miss Valentine said: ‘In relation to the voyeurism, it is said that Mr Faruk was engaged in sexual activity with three complainants, and during it, it is said that he has recorded their sexual activity, unbeknown to the females.’ ‘The recording device is said to have been contained in his watch.’ At least one of the allegations is said to have occurred while Faruk visited a brothel, the court heard. Chair of the bench, magistrate Mel Bryant, committed the case to the Crown Court. Faruk, of Barnet, north London, denies three charges of voyeurism and two charges of fraud by false representation. He was granted conditional bail and will next appear at Blackfriars Crown Court on 2 September for a preliminary hearing.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The frustration of trying to download a film online, watching the progress bar move mind-bogglingly slowly, may soon be a thing of the past. Scientists have created the world’s fastest network that can download a movie faster than you can blink. Danish researchers achieved the feat by creating a next-generation optical fibre that transfers 43 terabits per second. Scientists have created the world's fastest network that can download a movie faster than you can blink, by using a new type of optical fibre to transfer 43 terabits per second . Experts at Extreme Tech said that this means that they could use it to download a one gigabyte film in 0.2 milliseconds. The Danish team used single multi-core . optical fibre, which was developed by Japanese firm NNT. This . type of fibre contains seven cores - glass threads - instead of the . single core used in standard fibres, which makes it possible to transfer . more data. Surpisingly, the fibre is the same width as a standard fibre. The researchers at the Technical University of Denmark have now reclaimed the record for the fastest network, having previously lost it to experts at the Karlsruhe Institut für Technologie in Germany, who created a network able to reach speeds of 32 terabits per second. To reclaim . the title for the world’s fastest network, the Danish team used single multi-core . optical fibre, which was developed by Japanese firm Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NNT). This . type of fibre contains seven cores - glass threads - instead of the . single core used in standard fibres, which makes it possible to transfer . more data. Incredibly, the fibre is the same width as standard fibre. The researchers say that the worldwide competition in data speed is contributing to developing the technology needed to accommodate the growth of data traffic on the internet. Such traffic is estimated to be growing by 40 to 50 per cent every year, and is set to soar as more people use internet-connected devices in the home and technology in cars becomes more complex. The speed achieved means that the experts could use the network to download a one gigabyte film in 0.2 milliseconds, which is faster than the time it takes a person to blink. It is hoped that faster networks will make slowing loading screens (pictured) a thing of the past . Emissions linked to the total energy consumption of the internet as a whole make up more than two per cent of the global man-made carbon emissions, which puts it on a par with the transport industry. And these emissions are set to grow dramatically. ‘It is therefore essential to identify solutions for the internet that make significant reductions in energy consumption while simultaneously expanding the bandwidth,’ the researchers said. Physicists have claimed this week that optical fibre made of air could connect any point on Earth or in space, in the future. Professor Howard Milchberg says that an ‘air waveguide’ could enhance light signals collected from distant sources, making long-distance communication possible as never before. He believes such a breakthrough could allow colonies of people on Mars to communicate via a type of broadband, for example. The professor of physics at the University of Maryland believes waveguides could have many applications, including long-range laser communications, detecting pollution in the atmosphere, making high-resolution topographic maps and even laser weapons. This is an illustration of an air waveguide. The filaments leave 'holes' in the air (red rods) that reflect light. Light (shown by arrows) passing between these holes stay focused and intense . Professor Milchberg and his team have found a way to make air behave like an optical fibre, which could guide beams of light over long distances without loss of power, according to the study in the journal Optica. The air waveguides consist of a ‘wall’ of low-density air surrounding a core of higher density air. Just like a conventional optical fibre, the wall has a lower refractive index than the core, guiding light along a ‘pipe’. The physicists broke down the air with a laser to create a spark and used the air waveguide to conduct light from the spark to a detector a three feet (1 metre) away. The signal was strong enough so that they could analyse the chemical composition of the air that produced the spark. In fact, the signal was one-and-a-half times stronger than a signal obtained without the waveguide. While this may not seem a lot, over distances that are 100 times longer - where an unguided signal would be severely weakened - the signal enhancement could be much greater, the scientists explained.","Researchers from the Technical University of Denmark used a new type of optical fibre to transfer 43 terabits per second .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Do you struggle in social situations, hate making small talk and changes in routine? These are all key questions in a quiz designed to identify symptoms autism and its milder form, Asperger syndrome. Psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen and his colleagues at Cambridge's Autism Research Centre created the Autism-Spectrum Quotient as a measure of the extent of autistic traits in adults. This quiz . below contains 50 simple multiple choice questions about your outlook on . life - judged by how much you agree with certain statements. Examples . include: 'I prefer to do things with others rather than on my own', 'I . am fascinated by numbers' and whether or not you enjoy doing things . spontaneously. Others are: 'I usually notice car number plates or similar strings of information', 'I enjoy doing things spontaneously' and 'if I try to imagine something, I find it very easy to create a picture in my mind'. The quiz was designed for the Channel 4 show Embarrassing Bodies to help those possibly living with Autistic Spectrum Disorders. Figures last month released in the U.S. showed that Autism Spectrum Disorder is on the rise, with 1 in 68 children now diagnosed.  In the UK, it is estimated ASD affects one per cent of the population. To date, the quiz has been taken by 150,000 people and according to the website, a score of 26 or lower 'effectively discounts . the possibility of a diagnosis of autism'. The average score for the original control group of the test was 16.4.

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . A couple have been fined £120 for taking their son out of school to go on holiday with his terminally-ill grandfather. Trevor and Joanne Cannon asked for permission to take Alfie, 13, away for two weeks at the end of the summer term to go to Malta with grandfather George Mills. Basildon Lower Academy allegedly said it was not a good enough reason, but the couple decided to go anyway as Mr Cannon is given allocated holiday dates and cannot change them. Mr Cannon, a bus driver from Basildon, said: 'My father-in-law is terminally ill and we wanted to go to Malta as he loves it out there and we wanted to have a family holiday with him.' Punished: Joanna and Trevor Cannon were fined £120 for taking their 13-year-old son Alfie out of school to go on holiday to Malta with his terminally-ill grandfather. They were told the circumstances were 'not exceptional' He added: 'I've been fined and, fair enough, I'll pay the fine, that doesn't bother me, it is the principle. 'They sent us a letter saying it is not a good enough reason, but what is a good reason? 'I was told by someone if he was to die they would have allowed it, but if he had died we would not be going on a family holiday. 'Alfie is quite close to his nan and grandad. 'They spoil him rotten and he is always doing something with them and it might have been his last holiday with his grandad. 'I don't think it is very fair. 'It was all booked up and we were not going to lose all the money, so we decided to go and face the consequences afterwards. We got home and now Alfie's grandad is quite poorly.' Mr and Mrs Cannon received two letters charging them £60 each last week. Denied: Staff at Basildon Lower Academy allegedly said the grandfather's illness was not a good enough reason, but the couple decided to go anyway as Mr Cannon is given allocated holiday dates he cannot change . No one from the school was available to comment. A Department for Education spokesman said the decision about whether a case meets the exceptional circumstances requirement is taken by the headteacher. He would not comment on whether this case should have met that criteria. Headteachers no longer have the discretion to approve absences of up to 10 days a year for family holidays in 'special circumstances' because of new rules introduced in September 2013. Tougher criteria of 'exceptional circumstances' restrict approved absences to events such as family funerals.","Trevor  Cannon wanted  Alfie to spend a last holiday with grandfather in Malta .

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . Susan Larkin is alleged to have put a bag over the head of an elderly dementia sufferer in care home . A care home worker ‘put a plastic bag over the head of a resident with dementia and laughed at her as she was on the toilet’, a court has heard. Susan Larkin, 35, denies taking Celia Handley, who was in her seventies and suffering from severe, progressed dementia, into the lavatory and placing a bag used for incontinence pad disposal over her head at Peel Gardens care home in Colne, Lancashire. But her colleague Sahra Suleman, who says she witnessed the incident, was so shocked she went into another toilet cubicle and broke down in tears. Burnley Crown Court heard that Larkin, who is from Burnley, claims the allegation is malicious and has been made by staff members after no action was taken when she stole a pair of sunglasses in 2012. On the day of the alleged incident, which happened at some point between March 17 and 26, 2013, Larkin was working with Ms Suleman. Prosecutor Andrew Smith said Mrs Handley needed assistance from two carers to visit the bathroom. Ms Suleman left the room briefly and when she came back the alleged victim was sitting on the toilet. Mr Smith alleged: ‘Sahra Suleman saw Susan Larkin take a plastic bag, used for the disposal of incontinence pads, and place it, without warning, over the head of Celia Handley. ‘She stepped back, as witnessed by Sahra Suleman and crossed her arms, leaving the bag in place. Sahra Suleman is not entirely sure, but thinks she may have laughed briefly before removing the bag from Celia Handley’s head.’ ‘She describes herself as being shocked. It was there a few brief seconds. She left the room and went to an adjoining cubicle, where she herself broke down in tears, no knowing what to do.’ Mr Smith said some time the following week Ms Suleman confided in colleague Wendy Davis. She recalled that it was on April 1 that she was told by Ms Suleman and she decided she would write a letter to her manager about the disclosure, which was dated April 5. She handed it to care home manager, Malcolm Rowley, to act upon. The defendant was suspended from work shortly after and police were informed. It appeared just before the disclosure, there had been a second admission relating to the defendant - the allegation of theft of a pair of sunglasses in 2012. The defendant accepted she stole the glasses in 2012, which had been left at the home by Rosemary Shaw when she had been visiting her elderly mother.

She denies the claim and says the allegation is malicious by other members of staff . Peel Gardens care home in Colne, Lancashire, where the incident is alleged to have happened in March 2013 . Mr Smith said: ‘It’s the defendant’s case that this allegation [the ill-treatment allegation] is a malicious one, as a direct result, flowing from the decision by the care home not to take action in relation to the sunglasses.’ The prosecutor said Larkin was arrested over the ill-treatment allegation of Mrs Handley on April 10 last year and was interviewed. She denied any ill treatment of the alleged victim, outlined the incident involving the pair of sunglasses and suggested that may be a possible motive why other members of staff had made the allegation against her.

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . Boys as young as 11 in a Papua New Guinean tribe risk their lives to take part in a generations old ritual that pays tribute to the crocodile which leaves them with scale-like skin similar to the water-lurking reptile. The male members of the Chambri tribe - who live 721km north-west of Port Moresby near Chambri Lake - undergo this painful initiation to transition from being a boy to a man. It involves the boys having their skin cut a number of times and then healing which leaves marks that resemble those of crocodile scales. The Chambri tribe pays tribute to its ancestors, the crocodiles, by piercing the skin of boys which leaves scale-like scars . Clay and tree oil is inserted into the lesions to help them maintain their raised scale shape . The members of the Chambri tribe live 721km north-west of Port Moresby . Above, men in Palembei village . According to Papua New Guinean legend, humans evolved from crocodiles that became land-dwelling when they emerged from the Sepik River - which runs alongside Chambri Lake, NT News reported. To pay tribute to the creatures from which they evolved, the boys of the tribe are taken to a spirit house and kept there for six weeks before the initiation process happens. Then tribal leaders make deep, 2cm-long incisions across the bodies of young males - ranging from ages 11 to 30 in some cases, according to National Geographic. This excruciating process - which occasionally ends in death - is meant to demonstrate discipline, focus and dedication, and the only way the boys are allowed to numb the pain is by munching on a plant with healing qualities. All of these men in Palembei,  eastern Sepik, have gone through a month-long initiation and scarification . The process involves the boys having their skin cut a number of times and then healing, leaving marks . The only relief provided to them during the process is by chewing leaves with healing properties to numb the pain . It is believed that if they can withstand the pain it will make them stronger in later life. After this, the boys then stretch out in front of a fire so smoke can blow into the deep nicks, while clay and tree oil is inserted into the lesions to help them maintain their raised scale shape. When this is complete, a celebration takes place where the boys don headdresses and jewellery. The ritual marks a boy becoming man as it involves excruciating pain as the cuts are deep . A man is pictured sporting skin decorations that pay tribute to crocodiles near Sepik River . The Chambri tribe spreads over three villages - Indingai, Kilimbit and Wombum - and is made up of hunters and gatherers.

"By . Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia . and Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia . Two high profile Australian women broke their silence on Wednesday over the controversy surrounding baby Gammy - the disabled boy born via surrogacy who was allegedly abandoned by an Australian couple in Thailand. Providing very different perspectives on the ordeal - one touched on Australian surrogacy laws, while the other focused on adoption in a global sense. Before hosting the Gourmet Traveller Awards at the Sydney Opera House on Wednesday evening, Weekend Today host Leila McKinnon told Daily Mail Australia she believes Australia should look at tackling commercial surrogacy as a nationwide issue. Scroll down for video . Leila said she believes Australian surrogacy laws need an overhaul and there should be more options for Aussie couples who want children . The mother of two gave birth two her second child in May this year - but it was a long road to parenthood for her and husband David Gyngell . 'The fall out from Baby Gammy is tragic for couples who are genuinely available for surrogacy, it’s a difficult situation for women in some countries,' she said. 'The fact that we have shut the door on Indian surrogacy, and now to think we may lose Thailand, will mean many couples will lose out. The American system is so expensive, although legally safer, but for some couples the cost is out of reach.' Leila also said that the options for couples who want children but may not be able to have them themselves for any reason were limited and needed attention. 'We, Australia, needs to look at introducing paid surrogacy. It’s very difficult to adopt in Australia, there are too many restrictions, we need to make it easier for couples to achieve their dream of having a family. 'It needs to be tackled nationally, not just by each state, so that paid surrogacy can happen here and with the right guidelines of course,' she added. A mother of two herself - with her youngest child Gwen born in May of this year - the TV personality then reflected on her own experience as a mother. 'Some of the age limits are ridiculous. Between us, my husband and I are 80 and would be over the limit but we provide a beautiful home for our children.' While Deborra-Lee Furness didn't know all the facts about Gammy's case, she said a safe home should be found for him 'as soon as possible' Leila had her fair share of difficulties on the road to becoming a parent with her husband, Channel Nine CEO David Gyngell, including a miscarriage in 2011. Prior to having their first child, Ted, the high-profile pair had a nine-year battle to fall pregnant, including years of IVF treatment. Earlier on Wednesday Deborra-Lee Furness shared her thoughts on the tragic case of baby Gammy - who was said to have been left in Thailand by West Australian parents David and Wendy Farnell after they discovered he had Down Syndrome. Instead - the took his healthy twin sister Pipah home with them leaving Gammy with his surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua. The case caused outrage in Australia and around the world, especially after Mr Farnell was revealed to be a convicted child sex offender who served time in prison for a string of offences against girls as young as seven. Based in New York, the Australian actress, 58, who is an adoption advocate, told Daily Mail Australia that there were many special needs children across the world. Adoption Awareness will advocate throughout the year and continue to keep all issues surrounding abandoned vulnerable children and adoption in the forefront of the public's awareness . The co-founder of National Adoption Awareness Week launched the 'Adopt Change' as part of the campaign at Hilton Hotel on Wednesday . While she didn't know all the facts about Gammy's case, she said a safe home should be found for him 'as soon as possible'. 'You know what? Baby Gammy happens every minute in Africa,' Ms Furness said. 'There are so many special needs children that families don't have the physical or emotional resources to care for those kids. 'They are abandoned vulnerable children and they're the kids that we need to find families for. 'So I would say for baby Gammy, we need to find him a family as soon as possible.' The wife of Hollywood star Hugh Jackman, who has adopted two children with her husband, made the comments before a speech launching 'Adopt Change' as part of the National Adoption Awareness Week. When asked what her opinion was on the controversial topic of Thai surrogacy, she said she couldn't pass judgement on surrogacy. ‘We [Adoption Awareness] address abandoned and vulnerable children and we service adoption - surrogacy is another thing but it shows that people are natural human urges who want to love a child so there’s obviously a huge need to parent children so let’s try and get all the kids that need that love altogether,' she said. Ms Furness, who is Australia’s most high-profile adoption advocate launched the Adopt Change campaign at Hilton Hotel in Sydney on Wednesday. She said the organisation will advocate throughout the year and continue to keep all the issues surrounding abandoned vulnerable children and adoption in the forefront of the public's awareness. 'For decades, people weren’t talking about adoption and we didn’t have a system that worked properly and after years of what we’ve been advocating, we now have the politicians talking and creating new legislation,' she told Daily Mail Australia. The wife of Hollywood star Hugh Jackman, who has adopted two children with her husband said there were many special needs children across the world . 'There’s new legislation in NSW and hopefully that will be harmonised over all the states. We’re talking with Tony Abbott’s office. He has said he wants to create a better system. 'So pursue the adoption - we’re working on it and we’re gonna make it work more expediently and make sure that it’s ethical. 'If we do step up and we do adoption better, we need centres of excellence to provide pre and post adoptions support. 'I’d like to see this all over Australia to support the families, the children, the relinquishing parents to support everyone in this journey. 'That’s the mistake we’ve made in the past because we didn’t have support for families who had to devour this very complex journey,' she said.

"By . Sarah Dean For Daily Mail Australia . An Australian couple have made a desperate plea for help after they became stranded in Thailand with their newborn twins, born via a Thai surrogate mother. Kate and Adam Osborne, from Kempsey, on the mid north coast of New South Wales, are one of the many Australian couples who have become locked in legal battles after changes to Thailand's commercial surrogacy laws. They reportedly turned to Thai surrogacy as a last resort after numerous failed IVF attempts in Australia. 'They are in a tiny motel room with two newborns and money is running out fast,' their friend Jen Farrell wrote on a fundraising page set up to help the family. Scroll down for video . Kate and Adam Osborne's twin daughters, Mali and Sierra-Leone, were born in Thailand on July 22 on the same day that Thai laws regarding commercial surrogacy changed . At the end of July, the laws in Thailand radically changed to mean parents of surrogate children born in the country can no longer leave the country with their children without a court order granting consent from the birth mother. Anyone who disobeys this law could potentially be charged with child trafficking. Mr and Mrs Osborne's twin daughters, Mali and Sierra-Leone, were born in Thailand on July 22, just weeks before the horrific story of baby Gammy emerged and shocked the world. Gammy, also a twin, was born to a Thai surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, but was allegedly abandoned by his West Australian parents because he had Down syndrome. Gammy's biological father David Farnell later revealed in a 60 Minutes interview he would have terminated the embryo had he discovered the child's Down syndrome sooner, saying: 'No parent wants a son with a disability'. Mr Osborne explained that they can not simply bring their children home to Australia now, despite having all the required Australian documentation. The couple from NSW turned to a Thai surrogate after failed IVF attempts in Australia. They are currently stranded in a Thai motel with their newborn girls . 'Our twin girls have all their relevant paperwork (Australian citizenship, Australian passports),' he said while decribing his 'Thailand horror story'. 'Before the Thai army cracked down on commercial surrogacy on the twins birthday (22/7/2014)  you could just leave the country without anyone batting an eyelid with your new family. 'Now its a different story, now its considered ""Human trafficking"" because they see it as though we are stealing someones children, and if they ask to see babies' birth certificate that is proof because our surrogate's name is on certificate as their mother. 'We had D.N.A tests done and our babies are our babies and in no way, shape or form are related to birth mother (our surrogate). So we have to go through the courts now and get a court order to leave the country,' he explained. The young couple had already tried many unsuccessful rounds of IVF treatment in Australia before they went overseas to use a surrogate mother. At the end of July the laws radically changed to mean parents of surrogate children born in the country can no longer leave Thailand with their children without a court order . The Kempsey couple have posted photos of their baby girls from the Thai motel room they are staying in as they try and raise funds . Kate's sister Sonia told the Macleay Argus 'this was their last chance' at having children. 'Believe me, they have tried everything and this was not an easy option to take. 'We just want them home with their girls to be with their family. 'Their families have only seen a picture of the little girls and all we want to do is hold them in our arms. It's heartbreaking.' The couple reportedly missed their planned flight home this week as the Thai authorities blocked them from leaving with their girls. Meanwhile, a same-sex couple who are also caught up in the crackdown on surrogacy in Thailand have told the Sydney Morning Herald they know at least 20 Australian couples who are now stuck in Bangkok hotels. 'This is very emotionally draining. We had a meeting and I told them not to be stressed, to enjoy the fact they have their babies,' Steve said. The 46-year-old from Melbourne said he and his partner James are waiting to see if they can bring their baby boy Rhyley home. He explained that the Australian couples he had spoken to thought they would be in Thailand for five or six weeks and 'now there are rumours they will have to stay three months or six months, or who knows how long'. He said many are experiencing financial difficulties. A recent statement from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, regarding Australian parents being prevented from bringing their children home from Thailand, said: 'We have been advised that Thai authorities may enforce enhanced documentation requirements when exiting the country, when they suspect a child has been born by surrogacy in Thailand. Mr Osborne explained that they can not simply bring their children home to Australia now, despite having all the required Australian documentation . 'The Australian Government's Smartraveller website was updated on 14 August to reflect these requirements. 'We strongly urge Australians entering Thailand for the purposes of commercial surrogacy to seek independent legal advice in both Thailand and Australia before doing so. In particular, they should seek advice on the implications of any new exit requirements. 'While regulation of surrogacy in Thailand is a matter for Thailand, we continue to encourage Thai authorities to adopt appropriate transitional arrangements for any new measures they may introduce, so concerned Australians are not unduly affected.' Mr and Mrs Osborne are hoping to raise money to pay for new flights home and for the cost of their unexpectedly long stay in Thailand. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the couple for comment.

"By . Mark Bryans, Press Association . Ronald Koeman is preparing for Saturday's meeting with West Brom with the same respect he had for Liverpool last weekend - insisting he has no 'big club' hang-ups. The Dutchman lost his first competitive match in charge of Saints when they slipped to a narrow 2-1 defeat at Anfield on Sunday and will be hoping to pick up a win in his maiden home game against the Baggies. Between now and a November 30 meeting with reigning Barclays Premier League champions Manchester City, only a visit to face Tottenham and former boss Mauricio Pochettino at White Hart Lane sees Southampton face a team who finished above them last season. Orders: Ronald Koeman, manager of Southampton, gives instructions to his team at Anfield . New Saint: Ryan Bertrand was one of eight new signings to make their debut at Anfield . Games against newly-promoted Leicester and QPR also fall during that period, with West Brom the start of a healthy-looking run of fixtures for Koeman's side - but the former Feyenoord coach refuses to take anything for granted. 'I think it is not good to speak about the big clubs,' he said. 'If you look back to the results in the first matches, all of them are very close. Arsenal only won in the last minute (against Crystal Palace). 'What is a big team? The competition is very competitive and you have to play good and you have to be good to win against everybody. 'Sometimes the name of the club means a lot but, between the lines, it can be difficult against everybody and you have to prepare yourself to play well against everybody.' Many have tipped Southampton to struggle to replicate last season's best-ever eighth place finish given the sales of several key players. Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren all moved to Liverpool whilst Luke Shaw signed for Manchester United and Arsenal came in for Calum Chambers. Good start: Dusan Tadic impressed on debut for Southampton, laying on a goal for Clyne with a lovely touch . But Koeman has re-invested much of that money and his new-look side were unfortunate to lose at Liverpool, with Daniel Sturridge scoring a 79th-minute winner for the hosts. Having come close to taking a point from last season's runners-up, Koeman believes his players will be able to draw on that experience. 'It was frustrating,' he said about the defeat. 'I thought we played at a good level with an amazing second half and the result was not what we deserved. 'It was good for the confidence because maybe everyone was afraid about how we would start the season. We showed our qualities and showed we are a team who can be very competitive against everybody. 'We know this Saturday it will be different, maybe more difficult because everyone expects the same level at home and we have to dominate more than we did against Liverpool. The belief is in the team and in the players and everyone is ready for Saturday.' Prolific: Vincent Wanyama made more successful tackles in the first half than the whole Liverpool team .","Southampton impressed during their opening day defeat to Liverpool .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . It could have been a scene in the BBC's 1980s sitcom 'Allo 'Allo'. Teenage war hero Len Manning spent three months hiding in a French café after his Lancaster bomber was shot down in July 1944 - despite it being one of the Gestapo's favourite haunts. Now, the RAF veteran has finally received a medal for his bravery - 69 years later. 'People often liken it to the TV series ‘Allo ‘Allo! but it was a really risky experience,' said the Tail End Charlie rear gunner today. Hero: Len Manning, 88, spent three months hiding in a French cafe after his Lancaster bomber was shot down during a raid. He has finally received a medal for his bravery . 'I spent three months living in a . café/hotel in Bassevelle, hiding from the Germans who frequently used . the café and stayed at the hotel.' Mr Manning, from Sudbury, Suffolk, fought in the RAF’s savagely-battered Bomber Command during the Second World War. His 57th Squadron, based in East Kirkby, Lincolnshire, played a vital role bombing key strategic German targets as the Allies turned the tide of war against Hitler’s Germany. The airman, who was 19 years old at the time, was lucky to survive when his giant Lancaster was blasted out of the skies over northern France in July 1944 - killing four of his comrades. He plunged from the blazing bomber at 4,000ft with a burning parachute and was badly burned before going on the run from his German hunters. Fighter: Mr Manning, from Sudbury, Suffolk, fought in the RAF's savagely-battered Bomber Command during the Second World War . He told the East Anglian Daily Times: 'The plane was hit by a German fighter and immediately caught fire. 'After I climbed out of the turret into the fuselage which was burning furiously, it was like looking down the flames of a blow lamp. It was the most terrifying experience of my life. 'Although I managed to get out of the plane, the parachute had also caught fire and as a result, I was badly burned.' Four of Mr Manning’s fellow crewmen died in the stricken Lancaster. However, he was fortunate to be rescued by French Resistance fighters - although the unlucky navigator, who also survived the catastrophic crash, was captured by the Germans and sent to a Prisoner of War camp. Mr Manning kept his head down in Bassevelle until American troops liberated the town months later. 'They took us to a hotel and then flew us back to the UK where we were interrogated by M15 and bomber intelligence to make sure we weren’t Germans,' he recalled. 'I was given nine months sick leave because of the injuries I received and was then medically discharged.' He has always believed he and his comrades should have been given a medal because the air crew and particularly rear gunners – known as Tail End Charlies – stared into the face of death time and again. Lucky: The airman was fortunate to survive when his warplane was blasted out of the skies over northern France by a German fighter in July 1944. Above, the fallen Lancaster bomber . 'I was only 19 at the time and you couldn’t dwell on the possible dangers although it was at the back of your mind because every raid was risky,' he said. 'You literally had people shooting at you from the ground and fighters coming at you from all around – there was nowhere to escape so you had no choice but to go through it. 'I only did three raids before I was shot down and that was enough. Every raid was a trauma.' Mr Manning said angry Bomber Command members were not given medals because Prime Minister Winston Churchill believed it could have been seen as 'condoning killing civilians' after German cities were mercilessly bombed. 'We didn’t think it was fair because . all of the other services – the Battle of Britain, the Land Army – were . given campaign medals,' he said. 'More . than 30,000 air crew were killed in the war and we always felt it was a . bit of an insult not to be deemed worthy of a medal. There are not many of us left now and we felt really let down. Award: Mr Manning received his Bomber Command clasp at Ipswich Town Hall yesterday. He was presented with the medal by Ipswich Mayor Hamil Clarke (right), watched by Sudbury Mayor Adrian Osborne (centre) 'So about five years ago, we started a campaign to push for them (the government) to issue a medal – it was really about the principle of it.' Mr Manning has finally received a Bomber Command Clasp to mark the service he gave to his country as he risked his life time and time again. He was presented with the medal in a special ceremony at Ipswich Town Hall yesterday. He was accompanied by Sudbury Mayor Adrian Osborne, one of those behind the push to get rightful recognition for Bomber Command. Mr Osborne said: 'I have great respect for anyone who took part in the Second World War, especially in RAF missions, which were particularly dangerous. 'Those awful memories will live with the airmen forever and they will never lose the horror of what they’ve been through. 'It’s important to recognise the sacrifices they made and it’s a good reminder to younger generations. 'I’m really over the moon for Len that he has finally received the recognition he deserves.' 'Allo 'Allo! is set in a small town cafe in Nazi-occupied France during the Second World War. The 1980s BBC sitcom tells the story of owner René Artois, who is stuck in the middle of the Gestapo and the French resistance - both of whom frequent his cafe. Flirt: Many episodes include René's (centre) attempts to keep his affairs with waitresses a secret from his wife Edith (left) He ends up trying to appease the Germans - under the command of Colonel Kurt von Strohm - and the French resistance - under the watchful eye of Michelle Dubois - while avoiding getting himself killed. He also ends up being forced into hiding two clueless, English airmen - Fairfax and Carstairs - in his cafe. The dim-witted pair don't understand a word of French. Many episodes focus on the ownership of a painting - named 'The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies' - that everyone is trying to get their hands on. They also include René's attempts to . keep a string of affairs with his waitresses a secret from his wife . Edith, who is considered to be the worst singer in the world. His attempts are made even more humorous by the seemingly gay Lieutenant Gruber's advances - which often see the pair end up in embarrassing situations - and the fact that René is not exactly the best-looking man in France. Other characters include SS officer Otto Flick and his small sidekick Engelbert von Smallhausen; Madame Fanny, Edith's mother who lives in an attic above the cafe', and Yvette Carte-Blanche, a waitress who is in love with René and wants to elope with him. 'Allo 'Allo! was written and performed as a parody by writers David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd. It ran from 1982 to 1992 and comprised 85 episodes.","Len Manning, from Sudbury, Suffolk, spent three months hiding in a French cafe after his bomber was shot down in July 1944 .

One is older, rich and famous, a big hulk of a man; the other is young and fresh-faced and on the cusp of greatness. They become love rivals. The beautiful harpist marries the younger man, but realises it is the hulk of a man she really loves. The young woman and her older suitor run off together and are christened by those who have observed the unfolding drama ‘Beauty and the Beast’. Throw in a prince and a few hummable arias and it all has the makings of cracking entertainment. But this story has happened in real life. Bryn Terfel, the phenomenally successful 48-year-old Welsh bass baritone, is wildly in love with 27-year-old Hannah Stone, official harpist to the Prince of Wales. She has walked out on her husband of just two years, Gary Griffiths, an up-and-coming Welsh baritone. To add to 31-year-old Mr Griffiths’s pain, he has frequently been described as ‘the next Bryn Terfel’. In an interview in June 2012, a month before his nuptials with Miss Stone, Mr Griffiths talked about the similarities between himself  and Bryn. ‘Whenever someone makes a comparison between me and Bryn Terfel, I think it’s incredibly flattering,’ he said. ‘I spoke to him after I won the Gold Medal [an award given by the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, which Bryn won 20 years earlier] and he was extremely supportive. He’s such an incredible artist, but in many ways we are quite different as he’s a bass baritone and I’m a baritone. He’s such a busy guy and he finds  the time to support so many young singers.’ Indeed he does. Harpists, too. So just how was the lovely Hannah enticed away from the next Bryn Terfel into the arms of the actual Bryn Terfel? According to a well-placed source within the classical music world, Bryn launched a charm onslaught so intense that eventually Hannah could do nothing but capitulate. She had married Mr Griffiths in a romantic ceremony on Gower peninsula in South Wales in July 2012 and they had settled together at a property at Cardiff Bay. Hannah, who was brought up in Swansea, had come to prominence in 2011 when she landed the coveted role of official harpist to the Prince of Wales. She made her debut in the summer of that year at a charity reception at Charles’s Llwynywermod estate in South Wales, and said just beforehand: ‘I’m a little bit nervous, but I’m excited, too. I auditioned about five weeks ago, then I got a phone call from his [the Prince of Wales’s] secretary and an official letter. I couldn’t believe it. ‘I’ve played the harp since I was eight and ever since I knew about this role it’s been my dream.’ With the role comes prestige — but not a great deal of money. It is an unpaid position, for which  Hannah receives around £3,000 in expenses a year. Rivals: Welsh bass baritone Bryn Terfel, 48, pictured left, and Hannah Stone's husband Gary Griffiths, an up-and-coming Welsh baritone, pictured right, whom she married in 2012 . She is also part of the La Mer Trio with two other glamorous female  performers, Renate Sokolovska on  the flute and Maja Wegrzynowska  on viola. Bryn and Hannah had known each other for some time, after repeatedly appearing at the same classical events. It is possible that Bryn was bewitched by the pretty blonde at first sight, but managed to keep his feelings to  himself until his own marriage had broken down. He had married his childhood sweetheart, Lesley, in 1987, and the couple went on to have three children. But last year it was revealed that the marriage had collapsed at the end of 2012, after Lesley reportedly fell for a local man called Ian Pleming, who lived on a council estate a mile down the road from the couple’s white-walled mansion outside Caernarfon, Gwynedd. Meanwhile, Hannah seemed happy enough with Gary, posting this tweet in October last year: ‘Really enjoyed Mid Wales Opera’s Albert Herring!! Me and @Gary-Griffiths chuckled all the way through it!’ But the laughing stopped soon after that, it seems. Two months later, just before Christmas, Bryn and Hannah were thrown together to record the story of the Nativity for a Christmas special for the Welsh language channel, S4C. Bryn was clearly captivated by the beautiful young musician and posted this tweet during recording: ‘Hannah Stone, our beautiful royal harpist, getting ready for  her solo.’ ‘In fact, Bryn swept her off her feet. He . has a huge presence, a big personality. He pursued her, he paid her a . great deal of attention. Eventually she capitulated' A friend of Hannah Stone . At the outset, those around him thought that poor lovelorn Bryn would have no chance with a relatively newly-married woman 20 years his junior.‘The thing is, Hannah was perfectly happy with Gary,’ said a friend of Hannah’s. ‘It wasn’t as though she’d become disillusioned with marriage —  well, there wasn’t really time  for that. ‘It was clear Hannah was being friendly towards Bryn, but most of us thought she was leading him down the garden path. ‘In fact, Bryn swept her off her feet. He has a huge presence, a big personality. He pursued her, he paid her a great deal of attention.  Eventually she capitulated.’ The romance was revealed last weekend, but may have been going on for some time. In the classical music world, it has been an  open secret. Last month, Bryn watched Hannah perform with La Mer Trio at the Fishguard Music Festival. Afterwards, he helped her load her harp in her car and then they left together. When it was suggested to Ms Stone’s booking agent, Gillian Green, that they were not making a secret of the affair, she said: ‘Yes, I have spent an afternoon with them. Bryn was not playing at the concert, but he came along to it.’ Fishguard Festival manager Geraint Hodges said: ‘It’s not any great secret in music circles that they are a couple.’ Bryn and Hannah are represented by the same musical agency, Harlequins. Their agent, Doreen O’Neill, confirmed to the Mail that they  are on holiday together in Spain this week. ‘They see themselves as soulmates,’ says a friend. ‘They share the same taste in everything — film, music, food. They are in love, very happy and see a long-term future together. The 27-year-old harpist, pictured with patron Prince Charles. It is not known whether divorce proceedings between Hannah Stone and her husband are underway . ‘Hannah is very sensitive, of course, about how this has been perceived. She is keen not to be seen in a bad light. ‘They both see it as one of those things — a great love, nothing could be done about that. She says they were powerless. They make a striking pair and everyone calls them Beauty and the Beast.’ How their respective spouses feel about this ‘great love’ is another matter. Bryn and Lesley were  married for 25 years, during which time she focused on raising their children as her talented husband’s star rose. The bass baritone played numerous major roles in operas such as Don Giovanni, Cosi Fan Tutte and Wagner’s Ring operas. Soon the farmer’s son and his wife were living in that mansion outside Caernarfon, overlooking the Snowdonia mountains in one direction and the sea nearby to the west. The collapse of the marriage and Lesley’s affair with Ian Pleming, who works in a local supermarket and is known as ‘Chops’ to his friends, came as a shock to their friends. Out at a nightclub one night, Mr Pleming was reportedly attacked by two men — one wielding a glass or bottle — in the early hours as he drank and chatted with Mrs Terfel at the bar. As he was being consoled by door staff, Mr Pleming told them he was ‘in a relationship’ with Mrs Terfel, adding, as they tended to his injuries, that she was likely to receive an £8 million divorce settlement. The Terfels are currently going through the painful process of unravelling their finances as part  of the divorce. Bryn’s company, B Jones Cyfyngedig, which posted profits of £545,172 on its last accounts and appears to be co-run with Lesley, went into voluntary liquidation after the couple split. At the last accounts, Lesley and Bryn paid themselves £70,500 each in dividends. Whatever financial settlement Lesley emerges with, it seems that Mr Pleming will not be sharing in her riches — for the Mail can reveal that Lesley’s relationship with Ian has broken down. His mother confirmed to the Mail this week that the couple are no longer together. Lesley has remained at the family home in Caernarfon, while Bryn is living at his flat in West London, which is currently being renovated. Griffiths, meanwhile, was ‘bereft’ when Hannah left him, friends say. It is not known if divorce proceedings are under way. What, then, will be the final act in this fast-paced libretto? Will the star-crossed lovers marry, once they have extricated themselves from their current spouses? Only one thing seems certain. Gary Griffiths, it’s fair to say, will never wish to be referred to as ‘the next Bryn Terfel’ ever again.","Hannah Stone, 27, married 'up-and-coming' baritone Gary Griffiths in 2012 .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Scar: Wayne Urwin's injuries were so severe that he suffered bleeding in his brain and had to have part of his skull removed during an emergency surgery . A DJ had part of his skull removed and is now unable to listen to music after he was hit by a thug in a vicious attack on a night out. Father-of-two Wayne Urwin was struck by Aaron Robson following a dispute outside a bar in Morpeth, Northumberland, in March. The 36-year-old’s injuries were so severe he suffered bleeding in the brain and was put in an induced coma after emergency surgery to remove part of his skull. His family was told that it was unlikely he would survive the vicious attack. Mr Urwin, who came out of a coma and began a 'miraculous recovery', said that his 'life has completely changed' since the attack. The damage done to his brain means that he . can no longer work as a warehouse manager and has been placed on statutory sick leave. He said . that as a result of this he has lost his flat - and must now claim for . benefits for the first time. Mr Urwin, who used to volunteer at Radio Northumberland in his spare time, continues to suffer seizures and fits, which have left him unable to drive or listen to music. But he explained the hardest part is the way the attack has affected his two children, aged seven and four. He said: 'Seeing my . daughter’s face when she came to visit me in hospital, you could tell . she was really frightened when she saw me with all the staples and scar. 'I . can’t drive to see them and I only get to see them now when my dad . brings them round. I used to have them for one half of the week and . their mother used to have them the other half. That is really difficult. 'It’s . been hard losing my independence and it has been hard financially but . it’s so difficult not having a gauge on when I’m going to get better. It’s the uncertainty of the future.' Damage: Mr Urwin is awaiting another surgery to place a metal plate where part of his skull was removed from. He said he holds no hate towards Robson, who last week pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm without intent . Despite the horrifying impact the attack has had on his life, Mr Urwin said that 'he never held any anger' towards his attacker. Mr Urwin spent more than a month in hospital and his now living at home with his mother in Sunniside, Gateshead. He is awaiting further surgery to have a metal plate put into his head to cover the area where the piece of skull was removed. Mr Urwin said: 'I don’t remember anything about the actual night. I remember getting off the train and meeting my friends in a bar but that’s it. I don’t remember anything after that. 'I know there is CCTV of me arguing with Robson outside the pub but then we disappear from view and he apparently punched me and I fell to the ground. He ran off and it was passers-by that helped me. 'Completely changed': The father-of-two, pictured left before the attack, said that his life is very different now. Mr Urwin, pictured right today, can no longer work as a warehouse manager and said he has lost his flat . 'The first thing I remember is coming round from the coma. I remember opening my eyes and seeing my mate. I was really distressed and confused, I didn’t know what was going on. 'For some reason, I thought I’d been hit by a car. I was like that for a fortnight, really confused and not understanding what was going on. 'My memory was really bad. I couldn’t remember anything after about 30 seconds, which made me really distressed.' Mr Urwin, who now sees a psychiatrist and attends support groups for people with head injuries, will once again have to go back to intensive care when he has further surgery to insert the metal plate. He said: 'I feel like I can’t begin to properly move on until the plate is in.' 'It’s always looming there and I know I have to go back into hospital. I feel like a line can’t be drawn until that is over. I’m also have a drainage tube put in as my head doesn’t drain fluid properly. I’ll have that for the rest of my life. 'I know the doctors have said I’ve had a miracle recovery and I try to stay positive and focus on getting better. They say it will take about two years.' Robson, 20, of Cramlington, hit Mr Urwin outside the Shambles pub in Morpeth, Northumberland on March 30. Robson pleaded guilty to grievous bodily . harm without intent at Newcastle Crown Court last week. The case was . adjourned for sentencing. Mr Urwin said: 'Weirdly, I never held any anger towards him. He’s got his own issues and I need to stay positive and concentrate on my health and recovery. 'I do want to see justice done and I think he should go to prison for at least two years. I’ve lost at least two years of my life so, I would like to see him lose two years of his.' Mr Urwin's father Colin said the attack had had a devastating impact on the entire family. The 64-year-old said: 'You just can’t describe what it was like when we first saw him in hospital. It was just horrendous. Looking back, it’s all a bit hazy as we couldn’t believe what was happening. 'Wayne’s recovery has been absolutely fabulous but all we want now is for him to get his proper life back and to get settled.'","Wayne Urwin was struck by Aaron Robson in Morpeth, Northumberland .

"By . James Salmon . Follow @@JamesSalmon79 . The economy is springing back to life and there are ‘good reasons to suppose a gentle recovery is under way’, the governor of the Bank of England said last night. Sir Mervyn King also said there was ‘no reason’ why State-backed Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds could not be largely sold back to the private sector ‘within a relatively short period’. Delivering his most upbeat speech since the financial crisis, Sir Mervyn outlined a set of policies which he said could ‘roll back the dark cloud of uncertainty’ hanging over the economy. Recovering: Sir Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, said there are 'good reasons' for optimism regarding the recovery of the British economy . These include fixing Britain’s troubled banks, and cutting taxes and red tape to help businesses. Lloyds and RBS were bailed out with £66billion of taxpayers’ money during the financial crisis in 2008 but Chancellor George Osborne would like to return the banks to the private sector before the election in 2015. His aim is to achieve a large enough profit to fund tax cuts for millions but the Tories have recently started to downplay expectations, claiming that Labour ‘paid too much’ for the banks. Sir Mervyn told a business audience in Belfast: ‘I believe we can roll back the cloud of uncertainty darkening the outlook for demand, allow the rays of optimism to peer through, and sustain a recovery based on a successful rebalancing of the UK economy.’ He steered clear of the term ‘green shoots’, notoriously used by the then Chancellor Norman Lamont during the recession in 1991. But he said: ‘There are good reasons to suppose that a gentle recovery is under way.’ Back to private: Sir Mervyn added there is no reason why banks bailed out by the state, such as Royal Bank of Scotland, could not be sold back to the private sector within a short period . These, he said, included falling mortgage rates, rising share prices, and companies having a large amount of cash at their disposal to spend on expanding their business. There is also more cash swilling around the financial system. Britain's coveted credit rating was hanging by a thread last night as the country sank deeper into the red. Official figures showed the Government borrowed £15.4billion last month, up from £14.8billion a year earlier, fuelling fears that Britain will be stripped of its gold-plated AAA credit rating. In further bad news for Chancellor George Osborne, figures on Friday are expected to show the economy contracted again in the final three months of last year, leaving the country on the brink of a triple-dip recession. James Knightley, an economist at banking group ING, said: ‘The question is how long the UK can hold on to its AAA status.’ The Government borrowed £106.5billion from April to December, the Office for National Statistics revealed – £7.2billion, or 7.3 per cent, more than at the same stage of the previous year. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘These figures underline what the Chancellor said at the Autumn Statement: it’s taking time, but the economy is healing.’ Shadow Treasury minister Rachel Reeves said: ‘George Osborne’s economic plan is hurting, but not working. We urgently need a change of course.’ The comments come as the number of first-time buyers reached its highest level since before the financial crisis, with around 220,000 sales last year, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Figures from HM Revenue & Customs showed there were 932,000 house sales last year in total – a 5 per cent increase on 2011, but still half the level seen five years earlier. The FTSE 100 index of Britain’s biggest companies smashed through the 6,000 barrier just before Christmas, having soared by more than a quarter since the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The upbeat comments from the notoriously pessimistic governor come despite growing fears of a triple-dip recession. Figures published on Friday may show the economy shrank in the final three months of 2012 after the briefest of recoveries between July and September. But last night Sir Mervyn argued these figures ‘tell us little about the underlying health of the economy’, as they are affected by one-off factors such as the Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics. He conceded that ‘living standards have been squeezed for longer than at any time in living memory’. But he said the flagship Funding for Lending Scheme should make it easier for cash-strapped businesses and households to get cheaper loans. The scheme, launched in August by the Government and the Bank of England, provides banks with cheap money if they lend more to the economy. Sir Mervyn also made it clear the Bank was ready to print more money through quantitative easing in a bid to stimulate growth. He said: ‘Be in no doubt that we are ready to provide more stimulus if it is needed.’","Bank of England governor indicated a turn for the better for British economy .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Shopping on London’s bustling Oxford Street may be bad for your bank balance. But now there is evidence that it is detrimental to your health too, as it has been shown to have the highest levels of toxic air in the world. A scientist has revealed that the busy stretch of shops has the highest levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is produced by diesel fumes and can trigger asthma and heart attacks. Scroll down for video . Gasp! Oxford Street (pictured) has the highest levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the world, which is produced by diesel fumes from buses and taxis and can trigger asthma and heart attacks . The chemical irritates the lining of the lungs and leaves healthy people more susceptible to lung infections. Noticeable symptoms include wheezing, coughing, colds, flu, and bronchitis. David Carslaw, of King’s College London, told The Sunday Times that he has recorded peak levels of 463 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre of air, which is over three times higher than the average amount of the pollutant since the start of the year. He told the newspaper: 'To my knowledge, this [level] is the highest in the world in terms of both hourly and annual mean. NO2 concentrations [in Oxford Street] are as high as they ever have been in the long history of air pollution.' Even at the average, 135 milligrams per cubic metre, the nitrogen dioxide levels are three times higher than the EU’s safety limit. The street broke hourly limits of 200 milligrams per cubic metre more than 1,500 times during the year. Dr Carslaw told MailOnline 'This [Oxford Street] is easily the highest annual mean NO2 concentration in Europe.' Delhi and Mumbai, which are frequently pictured with smoggy skies, have average levels of NO2 at 62 micrograms per cubic metre in comparison. In February, figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs claimed that traffic travelling along the A302 - known as Grosvenor Place - which runs adjacent to Buckingham Palace, produced the highest levels of the toxic gas at an average of 152 micrograms per cubic metre of air in 2012. The study also found that Oxford Street was highly polluted, registering at an average of 150 micrograms near Marble Arch, while Trafalgar Square has an average of 138 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre of air. Not amused: In February, figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs claimed that traffic travelling along the A302 - known as Grosvenor Place - which runs adjacent to Buckingham Palace (pictured) produced the highest levels of toxic gas nitrogen dioxide at 152 micrograms per cubic metre of air . Park Lane, Knightsbridge and Covent Garden were all found to have seriously high levels of the pollutant. Bosses from the collection of shops down London’s most famous high street are calling on Mayor Boris Johnson to reduce the number of buses that crawl down Oxford Street. Richard Dickinson, chief executive of New West End Company which represents traders in Oxford Street, told The Independent: ‘We are working closely with the relevant London authorities to look at longer term traffic reduction initiatives and we are keen to see ideas rapidly put in place. Businesses in the West End want action.’ City Hall said that it has already reduced the number of buses by a fifth, while hybrid engines on London’s famous double decker’s are set to cut the pollution problem. Almost 30,000 people die every year due to respiratory problems caused by air pollution and nitrogen dioxide in particular has been linked to breathing issues. Pollutant mapped: The study, which was released in February, measured the average nitrogen dioxide levels in different parts of the capital in 2012, and found that Oxford Street, Park Lane and Buckingham Palace were among the polluted hotspots in London . Environmental groups criticised the state of affairs in February. Simon Birkett, Founder and Director of Clean Air in London, said: 'These levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are nothing short of staggering. 'The World Health Organisation guideline is no human exposure in a single hour over 200 micrograms per cubic metre (with an annual average guideline of 40). 'The thought that hundreds of thousands or millions of tourists and Londoners in a year may be exposed to air pollution this high is deeply troubling. 'In London, we need the Mayor to: ban the oldest cars emitting carcinogenic diesel exhaust as Berlin did more than four years ago, remove the turning circle requirement that still forces cabbies to choose between two large diesel taxis if they want a new vehicle and reinstate Phase 5 of the low emission zone that was a key commitment in the Mayor’s Air Quality Strategy until scrapped early last year. 'He also needs to ensure his ultra-low emission zone for 2020 includes the roads with the highest NO2 rather than excluding them which will force the most-polluting vehicles to join those avoiding the congestion charging zone and issue smog warnings to save lives, avoid hospitalisations and build public understanding of air pollution. The UK faces fines of up to £300m from the European commission after they launched legal action due to a failure to reduce high levels of NO2 air pollution from traffic. The commission said this was despite over a decade of warnings and several extensions and postponements given to the British government. Other European countries have also failed to meet the air quality directive, the commission said. A Defra spokesman said: 'Air quality has improved significantly in recent decades. Just like for other Member States, meeting the NO2 limit values alongside busy roads has been a challenge. 'That is why we are investing heavily in transport measures to improve air quality around busy roads and we are working with the Commission to ensure this happens as soon as possible.' The agency highlighted that the UK meets the EU air quality limit values for all other air pollutants. Responding to the figures in February, a spokesman for Boris Johnson said: ‘London’s air quality is steadily improving, meeting legal limits for eight out of nine EU regulated pollutants. 'Since the Mayor was elected NO2 emissions have reduced by 20 per cent and the number of people living in areas exceeding NO2 limits has halved but he fully recognises the need to take further action. 'This includes the introduction of the world's first Ultra-Low Emission Zone in central London from 2020, tougher requirements for taxis from 2018 and a £20million fund to tackle local problem areas. 'These most ambitious measures will deliver enormous economic and environmental benefits for central London and will make this global city an even better place to live, work and visit.'","Scientist from King's College London recorded peak levels of 463 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre of air on Oxford Street .

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . Small project: John Hay, 67, has decked out the former British Telecom box with First World War memorabilia in Barningham, County Durham . A retired marketing director has converted a rare green telephone box into what could be the world’s smallest war museum. John Hay, 67, has decked out the former British Telecom box with First World War memorabilia to create a miniature museum in County Durham. The phone box in Barningham has been renamed the Listening Post and is filled with newspapers and collectables from 1914. It contains historic items including newspaper front pages published between June and December of that year, as well as a replica of a brass tin which was given to every soldier by Princess Mary as a Christmas present in 1914. The phone box is also filled with a tin helmet, maps of some of the early battles and a copy of the village flyer, which has been disguised as the trench magazine the Wipers Times. Sandbags, toy rats and bully beef tins - all familiar sights in the trenches - have also been included. Mr Hay - a Barnington resident since 1987, who lives in a four-bedroom semi-detached house with his wife Sheila, 67 - decided to create the small exhibition after painting a portrait of his grandfather in his First World War uniform. He said: ‘I decided to create the miniature museum after I finished the portrait of my late grandfather from 1914 when he was just off to war. I hung the portrait in the phone box and my wife said to me why don’t you keep going. 'So I decorated it with poppies and converted the telephone box into a World War One display. My wife Sheila did a lot of the research. 'She researched how little bears which were tucked into soldiers’ top pockets as a keepsake and how women were known as ""canaries"" as they turned yellow due to prolonged exposure to sulphuric acid through their work making shells in the munitions factories. 1914: The phone box has been renamed the Listening Post and is filled with newspapers and collectables .

Anne Anstey was on her way home from a Royal British Legion Club in Meadowfield, County Durham, when the 18-year-old dragged her to the ground and punched her. The 75-year-old was left cowering on the floor with blood streaming down her face as the teenager, Michael Kingshott, ran away with her handbag. Write caption here . Mrs Anstey required stitches to the inside of her mouth and root canal dental treatment as a result of the attack. Durham Crown Court heard how the woman was walking home when Kingshott crept up behind her, threatening: 'Do you want this to get rough'. The 18-year-old, who was high on drugs and alcohol, pulled her to the ground and punched her on the left side of her face. Police discovered the woman's discarded handbag with £28 missing in the days after the attack. The court heard how Mrs Anstey was living in fear after the attack, and found herself constantly checking windows and doors at her home. Judge Peter Kelson QC told the teenager his motivation was purely financial, after his sister had earlier refused to give him money. 'You were clearly lying in wait when that lady left that club. 'You were consumed with a cocktail of drink and drugs, walking the streets of that village cowardly looking for a victim.

"By . Camilla Canocchi . British tourists abroad have long been described as sunburned, drunk and wearing questionable footwear. And a survey today confirms this traditional stereotype - as the French, Germans and Spanish all agree that UK travellers were the heaviest drinkers on holiday. However, the Brits' sense of humour and open-mindedness made up for their red shoulders and debateable sense of fashion, according to Travelzoo. Fun-loving party spirit: UK travellers were said to be the heaviest drinkers on holiday but also the ones with the best sense of humour . The online travel agency asked people in the four European nations what they thought of stereotypes about themselves and tourists from the other four countries. Richard Singer, Travelzoo European managing director, said: 'Luckily for us Brits, our world-famous sense of humour continues to be our saving grace on foreign shores. 'Our fun-loving party spirit also came out in the feedback from other nations, but perhaps a little restraint with the sangria and sunshine is called for, as well as a little more care in our appearance when hitting the beach!' Stereotypes: Spanish tourists were described as helpful, while UK travellers as sunburned . More than half of the Spanish polled said Britons were the least generous on holiday, while the other European travellers seem to perceive the Germans as 'pushy', 'demanding' and 'beer drinkers' when abroad. Overall, Spanish tourists were voted by the other three countries as the most likeable, topping the lists for being the most corteous, generous, friendly and helpful. On the other hand, the French were the least popular, as they were labelled 'arrogant' and 'rude' - a stereotype for which they are known around the world. Half of Britons criticised French travellers for lacking humour, and a further 47 per cent said the French lack courtesy, . 'Beer drinkers': Germans were also perceived as 'pushy' and 'demanding' when abroad by their European cousins . The overwhelming majority of French travellers, however, thought of themselves as courteous individuals. And while French may have high views of themselves, Germans turned out to be most self-critical, with 55 per cent admitting that the stereotypical German traveller was not generous enough. Some 47 per cent of Germans also thought themselves not child-friendly, but this was in stark contrast with UK and French tourists' view, who substantially thought that their 'beer drinkers' cousins are actually good with children.","The majority of French travellers considered themselves to be generous .

"By . Aap . Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has told an inquiry into the treatment of children in detention about the 'moral burden' and 'emotional challenges' of his job, but says indulging in sentiment will result in more asylum seeker deaths at sea. Mr Morrison made the comments during his opening statement into an Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry hearing into the treatment of children in detention. 'There is much emotion in this serious topic that is before your inquiry. There should be,' he told AHRC president Gillian Triggs in Canberra. Scroll down for video . Immigration minister Scott Morrison speaking during a public hearing of the Human Right Commission at Parliament House in Canberra today . 'As a parent of two young children, the emotional challenges of working in this policy portfolio are just as real and just as great [as] they would be any other parent in my position. 'But sentiment cannot be indulged at the expense of effective policy that is saving lives and ending the chaos and tragedy that was occurring.' He said the Australian people decided at the last election that enough children had drowned while seeking asylum. 'There is no decision that I, or any of my predecessors, take as a minister in this area that is free of moral burden.' A group of asylum seekers are transported to Christmas Island in July 2012 after their boat issued a distress signal . 150 children will be released from mainland detention centres into the community. But approximately 700 children will remain in detention on Christmas Island (pictured) and on Nauru . The inquiry comes as this week Mr Morrison announced that 150 children held in mainland detention centres would be released into the community on bridging visas by the end of the year. Approximately 700 children will remain in detention centres, including those in Nauru and on Christmas Island. Concerns have been raised by refugee advocacy groups about the effect mandatory detention has on children, with allegations of physical and sexual abuse and deprivation outlined in a recent report released by the Australian Human Rights Commission. However Mr Morrison said the inquiry should be investigating his Labor predecessors, under whose watch most of the children arrived in Australia. Mr Morrison expressed disappointment the commission had not sought testimony from his four Labor predecessors, given more than 8,469 children arrived in Australia by boat during the Labor years. 'I invite the commission to rectify this situation by extending an invitation to my predecessors,' he said. Under the Abbott government, more children had been released from detention than put in, he said. He said just 353 children had arrived in Australia by boat since the September election, while 537 were released from detention - with the further 150 to come out in coming months. A drawing done by a six-year-old asylum seeker currently detained in Australian . There have been allegations that the conditions of the detention centres could cause depression and trauma for the children . Prof Triggs pressed Mr Morrison for any evidence that detaining children for long periods of time had a deterrence effect. 'There appears to be no connection between these two,' she said. People she had interviewed in mainland centres and on Christmas Island had 'no idea' of that aspect of government's policy. But Mr Morrison said detention of young children was merely a consequence of the government's policy not to allow refugees to be processed in Australia. That was followed by a heated exchange about whether detention facilities employed armed guards and resembled prisons. Prof Triggs said there was no way into the centres except through armed guards. Immigration department secretary Martin Bowles took issue, categorically denying armed guards work at the centres and calling on Prof Triggs to retract her statement. The commissioner then claimed conditions on Christmas Island were similar to those of prisons, prompting Mr Morrison to query whether she was comparing the facility with Long Bay jail. Prof Triggs said she would like to move on. Mr Morrison blamed the government's lack of movement on processing tens of thousands of backlogged refugee applications on the Senate, which was refusing to pass the reintroduction of temporary visas. The government's policy was to no longer grant permanent visas to refugees meaning there was no visa available for them, he said. 'And the government is not going to allow a set of policies to be weakened that would see an Australian staring into the face of a child corpse again,' he said.

"By . Associated Press . An auction ended Friday with no bids for the New Hampshire compound of a tax-evading couple convicted of amassing an arsenal of weapons and holding federal law enforcement officials at bay for months. The auction of Ed and Elaine Brown's fortress-like home on 100 acres in Plainfield was held at U.S. District Court in Concord. The minimum required bid was $250,000. Elaine Brown's dental office in Lebanon also was being auctioned but got no bids . Prospective bidders have not been allowed to tour the property, and last year, the U.S. Marshals Service cited the possibility of land mines and other explosives buried on the property as a complication. Buyers beware: The home of Ed and Elaine Brown in Plainfield, New Hampshire, is up for sale for a minimum bid of $250,000 after the couple went to prison for tax evasion. The property may still have land mines . The court has ruled that the Browns and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale. If the properties sell, the first entities to be paid would be the municipalities of Plainfield and Lebanon, which are owed back property taxes. The Browns, who do not recognize the federal government's authority to tax its citizens, had a nine-month standoff with authorities in 2007 after they were sentenced to five years in prison for tax evasion. Ed Brown was affiliated with the Constitution Defense Militia, an organization against taxation and that believes there could be a federal takeover of private property, the New Hampshire Sunday News reported. He named as part of this alleged conspiracy presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush, Soviet Union's last leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, the United Nations, among others. During the 2007 standoff, he was prepared with guns, ammunition and 18 months worth of food stockpiled in his basement. He said the militia would react violently and there would be 'blood in the streets' if the government tried to take over his guns, according to the New Hampshire Sunday News. While the Browns kept federal marshals . at bay during the standoff, they welcomed a parade of anti-tax and anti-government . supporters. One such visitor was Randy Weaver, whose wife and son were killed along . with a deputy U.S. marshal in a 1992 shootout on Weaver's property in . Ruby Ridge, Idaho. The couple was arrested peacefully when U.S. marshals posed as supporters and were able to get inside. They were convicted in 2009 of amassing weapons, explosives and booby traps and plotting to kill federal agents who came to arrest them. Ed and Elaine Brown, both in their 70s, are serving 37 and 35 years in prison. As of a year ago, numerous federal agencies with explosive detection equipment and dogs still couldn't ensure the land was free of booby traps. But the hilltop house and the grounds up to the tree line have been searched extensively and have deemed free of improvised explosive devices and other booby traps.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A provocative Tumblr blog called Women Against Feminism is kicking up a predictable storm amongst women who do identify as feminists. The blog collects photos of women posing with hand-written signs that all begin: 'I don't need feminism because...' - and are peppered with a variety of reasons, common themes including: 'I am not a victim,' 'I'm proud to be a stay-at-home mom,' and 'I love chivalry.' Largely, the response to this blog - especially to posts such as 'I don't need feminism because I like when men say compliments about my body!' - has been less than favorable, with reactions ranging from mockery and disregard, to all-out horror. Speaking out: Women Against Feminism is a Tumblr blog which invites people to pose with their own reasons as to why they are anti-feminist, and has attracted both support and a backlash . The campaign is reminiscent of the 2012 Who Needs Feminism Tumblr, which invited women to share their reasons for being pro-feminist, although Women Against Feminism don't claim their blog is a response to it. Women Against Feminism has triggered countless angry responses, largely accusing . submitters of having completely missed the concept of feminism, and branding them 'naive,' 'selfish,' and 'poorly educated.' Posts such as these were especially criticized: 'I don't need feminism because my . self-worth is not directly tied to the size of my victim complex!' And: 'As a woman in the Western world, I am not . oppressed and neither are you!' As . a point of reference, the dictionary definition of the term describes . feminism as: 'The theory of the political, economic, and social equality . of the sexes.' The anonymous founder of the blog feels, however, that many modern feminists don't subscribe to this. 'Feminism is not what it claims to be,' she writes. 'Anyone can recite a dictionary definition. But my rejection of feminism comes from more real-life reasons.' Loving life: Many of the submitters feel the war has already been won in terms of gender equality . History: This woman is referring to Susan Brownell Anthony, the American social reformer who played a pivotal role in the women's suffrage movement, which resulted in women's right to vote in 1920 . Popular view: The feeling that feminism contradicts the traditions of a family is a commonly occurring thread for the Women Against Feminism . Stay-at-home mom: Many women defended their husbands or other male family members from what they feel is unfair prejudice . 'I don't need feminism because I don't need to grow out my body hair to prove I'm equal to men,' one submission reads. Another vented: 'Respecting my husband as the MAN in our marriage does not make me less of a woman! I don't need to demonize men.' 'How the f**k am I supposed to open jars and lift heavy things without my husband?' Also found on Women Against Feminism are frequent posts from stay-at-home moms, such as: 'I don't need feminism because I made my own choice to be a stay at home mother and my working husband should not be harassed.' Then there were several mentions of rape, with one woman posting: 'I don't need feminism because getting drunk at a party and having sex with a stranger is just irresponsibility, not rape!' And on a lighter note, one woman with the reasoning: 'How the f**k am I supposed to open jars and lift heavy things without my husband?' Loves cooking: This woman feels that feminists have a tendency to  'whine hysterically' until people 'buy' them stuff, and that children are considered punishment . Independent: The blog has triggered a storm of critics, largely women who do consider themselves feminists and feel the submitters (such as this woman) have got the concept of feminism wrong altogether . No victim: Plenty of submitters resent being considered 'weak' just because they are women . The blog prompted one feminist, writer Rebecca Brink, to respond with a slew of satirical posts. 'I don't need feminism because I want boys to like me,' reads one, while another states: 'I don't need feminism because the only way I think I can get along in this world is by pandering to the status quo and sh***ing on other women.' 'I don't need feminism because I'm a teenager who hasn't entered the workforce yet' She also fed into the shared view of several others, that many of the Women Against Feminism submitters were simply too young to fully understand certain issues surrounding the concept. 'I don't need feminism because I'm a teenager who hasn't entered the workforce yet and I don't know what constant sexual harassment or watching unqualified people get promoted over me feels like,' Ms Brink posted. True stories: This women says she was bullied by a female teacher for wanting to be a wife and mother, and feels feminism fuels such treatment . Body hair: While some submissions were rambling, others kept their views simple and to-the-point . Stigma: This woman says her brothers have been unfairly demonized all their lives for being male . Joanne Sandler, a feminist who has been working with women's right initiatives in more than 80 countries for over 40 years, spoke to MailOnline about her view on the Women Against Feminism blog. 'If the women ""don't need"" feminism . because they have transcended gender discrimination... They've achieved a feminist utopia' She said: 'If the women ""don't need"" feminism because they have transcended gender discrimination and inequality, more power to them... They've achieved a feminist utopia. That's good news! 'The fact that they understand feminism in a way that is different from my daily reality and understanding is something that I can live with. 'I hope they keep talking about feminism. We need the publicity. It will guarantee that feminism will still be there when and if they are interested.' Easy: This woman doesn't need feminism, it appears, because it goes against chivalry . Not rape: It is not entirely clear why this woman chose to broadcast her message naked . In response to the backlash they have faced, Women Against Feminism issued the following statement on its Facebook page, which has amassed over 13,800 'likes' and counting: 'So feminists have been calling us lots of names lately. 'Basically they are saying, ""You're too stupid to know what you want. You need us to tell you what's good for you. And if you try to get away, we will throw insults""... Are all feminists like this? No. Are a lot of them like this? Yes. Just look at how the ""feminist media"" has treated us this week.' It may be a hot topic this week, but this is not a new debate. Girls creator Lena Dunham has previously weighed in on the subject, saying: 'So many women have come to this idea of it being anti-male - but what feminism is about is equality and human rights.' Opinions differ: Lena Dunham (left) wants to ditch the 'anti-male' label from the feminist equation, Ellen Page (center) thinks we still live in a 'patriarchal society' and Lana Del Rey (right) thinks feminism is 'boring' Actress Ellen Page thinks the battle for gender equality is far from won, stating: 'I don't know why people are so reluctant to say they're feminists. Could it be any more obvious that we still live in a patriarchal world when feminism is a bad word?' And as for songstress Lana Del Rey, she's over the whole thing altogether. 'Whenever people bring up feminism, I'm like, god. I'm just not really that interested,' she said in a recent interview. 'For me, the issue of feminism is just not an interesting concept.'","The Tumblr blog invites women to pose with their own reasons for being anti-feminist .

'I was kind of sticking up in the air, kind of disoriented. Hit the gas, nothing happened. No contact with anything in the back wheels. They were spinning. I felt a rocking motion and I felt myself sinking,' Huddlseton told WTAE. Scroll down for video . Trapped: A sinkhole opened up in Ross Township, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, swallowing up a car in a tanning salon's parking lot . Need for repair: Authorities say the sinkhole opened up due to a collapsed storm drain underneath the store . So she called the tanning salon to ask for help and owner Lisa Masley came running. 'When I went out to help her, I kept thinking, ""Don't stand too close."" I was a little nervous when I was out there. And as soon as we got her out, we just ran into the salon.' Just seconds after pulling her out of the window of the car, Huddleston's car was swallowed whole into the sinkhole. According to the town manager, the sinkhole emerged after a storm pipe collapses in recent heavy rains.

'When we get a heavy rain like that, it caused an additional issue and the fact the pipes were outdated and needed to be replaced,' Ross Township POlice Detective Brian Kohlhepp said. Town manager Douglas Sample says maintenance of the pipes is the local businesses' responsibility, but that the city took video of the deteriorating pipes two years ago and warned the store owners to repair them. Some business owners took the advice, while others didn't. Wednesday morning, crews were busy clearing the sinkhole and repairs are expected to take about a week.","Natalie Huddleston was leaving an appointment at a tanning salon when she backed into a 17-foot deep sinkhole .

"By . James Rush . Parody singer 'Weird Al' Yankovic's latest album has become the first comedy record in more than 50 years to top the Billboard charts. The 54-year-old cult singer has found fame over the last 30 years by parodying popular songs of the day, with the likes of Like A Surgeon (Madonna's Like a Virgin), Eat It (Michael Jackson's Beat It) and Smells Like Nirvana (Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit). His latest record, Mandatory Fun, however has become the first number one of his career after it was launched with a promotional campaign which saw eight new music videos released in as many days. Scroll down for videos . 'Weird Al' Yankovic (pictured, left, in 2013 and, right, on stage in 2012) has scored his first number one album with his latest record Mandatory Fun . The singer's latest album features parodies of recent hits including Pharrell's Happy, or as Yankovic's is called, Tacky (pictured) The album features his trademark parodic style on versions of recent pop hits including Pharrell's Happy (Tacky) and Lorde's Royals (Foil). The album sold 104,000 copies in its debut week, according to figures compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, making it the first comedy record to top the chart since 1963. The album has also had the most weekly sales for a comedy album since 1994. Yankovic, whose previous highest charting album was 2011's Alpocalypse which reached number nine, told the Associated Press: 'This has been an amazing week. I can't even tell you. 'I have been doing roughly the same thing for many, many years, and this is the best week of my life in terms of like the response from people. 'It's just insane and it's extremely gratifying. It's hard for me to wrap my head around (it).' The latest record, the first comedy album to top the charts in 50 years, also features Yankovic's version of Lorde's Royals, called Foil (pictured) The online video campaign to promote his latest album has reportedly been a remarkable success, with the videos being viewed a total of 46million times, according to The New York Times. The paper said the videos, rather than being funded by record label RCA, were in fact paid for by websites including CollegeHumor, Funny Or Die and Nerdist. The singer, who famously seeks for the approval of each artist he parodies, has also spoken of how he managed to get in touch with Pharrell Williams to speak to him about doing a version of his hit Happy. The singer has found fame over the last 30 years by parodying popular songs of the day, with the likes of Like A Surgeon (Madonna's Like a Virgin) and Eat It (Michael Jackson's Beat It) Explaining that while the usual procedure is for 'his people' to get in touch with the 'artist's people', Yankovic said in this case he went straight to the source after he didn't hear back from Pharrell's camp. 'I somehow got Pharrell's home email address - I won't say how - and I emailed him and asked if I could do the parody,' recalled the comedian. 'He couldn't have been nicer and he said he was honored to have me do the parody.'","Parody singer scores first number one with latest album Mandatory Fun .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A couple's crystal ball failed to predict their house bursting into flames - after sun rays bounced off the mystical glass ornament. Fire crews were called out to control the flames which tore across the living room after a curtain set alight. Alarmed, the man and woman inside tried to tackle the blaze with a garden hose and towels - before fleeing their home in Romford, Essex. Carnage: The Romford living room was left blackened after sun rays bounced off the crystal ball on the window sill . The man had been asleep after a night shift when the fire started at 3.30pm on Saturday and was woken up by his smoke alarm. Fire Investigation Officer Mick Boyle from London Fire Brigade said: 'The blaze caused severe damage to the bedroom but thankfully no one was hurt. 'The man, who was asleep in the bedroom when the fire started, was woken up by the smoke alarm going off. That smoke alarm saved his life - he could easily have slept through and been overcome by smoke.' Fire fighters rushed to control the flames after the couple tried in vain to put them out with a hose and towels . The man had been asleep at 3.30pm after a night shift in his Romford home but awoke to the smoke alarm . The London Fire Brigade has issued a stern warning to homeowners not to keep glass bottles or ornaments on window sills. Mr Boyle added: 'You can't predict the future, but you can prevent this type of fire by keeping glass ornaments, mirrors, and bottles away from sunny window sills. 'You should never try and fight a fire yourself - they can develop very quickly and you can really put yourself in danger. 'Garden hoses and towels are never going to be enough to extinguish a blaze like this, so the best thing you can do is close the door on the fire, get out, stay out, and dial 999.'","Man asleep in Romford home on Saturday at 3.30pm when fire started .

Elsewhere odds on Pulis are as low as 7/2, whereas just yesterday he was listed at around 140/1 by some bookmakers. It is a big task to fill the shoes of a manager who left the club having just been named Premier League Manager of the Season. So who better to replace such a man than...the Premier League Manager of the season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Keith Millen: It's been a strange few days at Crystal Palace . Return? Bookmakers have slashed the odds on Tony Pulis making a dramatic return to management . Pulis left the club just two days before the start of the Premier League season by mutual consent, with a disagreement over transfer policy causing him to fall out with co-chairman Steve Parish. Former Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay was favourite to take over from Pulis, but Crystal Palace have distanced themselves from the manager after the emergence of allegedly racist and sexist text messages, which also led to the resignation of sporting director Iain Moody. With Moody no longer in charge of transfer policy, and Mackay no longer an option, Pulis has moved up the pecking order to be the next Palace boss. Ruled out: Tim Sherwood (left) ruled himself out of the job while Malky Mackay is no longer being considered . Tim Sherwood has also ruled himself out of the running for the job, leaving the way open for Pulis to return. However, the Welshman is still not the outright favourite for the job.

"By . Robin Cottle for MailOnline . Wolves completed a top-class hat-trick as a stoppage-time own goal from Mark Hudson earned them a 1-0 win Sky Bet Championship win against Cardiff. Hudson deflected the ball into his own net following a speculative shot from Kevin McDonald. The goal ensured Wolves have now beaten all three of the sides relegated from the Barclays Premier League last season, having already secured 1-0 wins against Norwich and Fulham. Last-gasp: Wolves players celebrate Mark Hudson's stoppage-time own goal . The defeat capped a testing week in the worst possible way for Cardiff, who were in the headlines in the build-up to the game following the probe into former manager Malky Mackay and sporting director Iain Moody. Wolves should have had the game wrapped up by half-time as they dominated without having a real cutting edge in front of goal. Cardiff, who were beaten for the first time this season, were a different proposition after the half-time introduction of striker Kenwyne Jones and he looked set to win the game for then in the 83rd minute only to be denied by a stunning save from Carl Ikeme. Wolves winger Bakary Sako set the tone for the first period when he was denied a spectacular 13th-minute opener by the woodwork. Top six: Hudson's late intervention sees Wolves jump into the fledgling Championship's play-off places . After a spell of sustained Wolves pressure, they forced two corners in quick succession and from the second Sako whipped in a curling centre. The ball flew over the outstretched hand of goalkeeper David Marshall and the Scotland international was relieved to see it bounce to safety off the inside of his far post. Wolves did carry the greater threat in the early exchanges and Cardiff were left to breathe a sigh of relief again when Rajiv van La Parra's 20th-minute shot was deflected wide for a corner. The hosts were then caught out from their own corner with Adam Le Fondre launching a one-man counter-attack that saw him race the full length of the field before pulling his shot across the face of Ikeme's goal. It was a rare moment of menace for Cardiff, who were struggling to keep the three-pronged Wolves attack of Van La Parra, Sako and Nouha Dicko in check. Committed: The home side's Scott Golbourne is challenged by Matthew Connolly of Cardiff . Dutchman van La Parra should really have made Wolves' pressure pay off on the half-hour when he was picked out at the far post by a cross from left-back Scott Golbourne only to fail to hit the target with his close-range header. Wolves: Ikeme; Doherty, Batth, Stearman, Golbourne; Evans, McDonald, van La Parra (Henry 87), Edwards (Jacobs 66); Sacko, Dicko . Substitutes not used: Clarke, McCarey, Ricketts, McAlinden, Ebanks-Landell . Scorer: Hudson own goal 90 . Booked: Evans, McDonald . Cardiff: Marshall; Connolly, Hudson, Morrison, Da Silva; Pilkington (Burgstaller 66), Gunnarsson (Dikgacoi 75), Adeyemi, Whittington; Le Fondre, Maynard (Jones 46) Substitutes not used: Brayford, Macheda, Eikrem, Moore . Booked: Adeyemi, Connolly . Referee: Darren Drysdale (Lincolnshire) Attendance: 21,221 . Van La Parra then tested Marshall from long range and right-back Matt Doherty fired into the side-netting as Cardiff's goal continued to lead a charmed life. Wolves' failure to take advantage of their dominance should really have been punished on the stroke of half-time as Cardiff finally managed to muster a chance of their own. A corner from Anthony Pilkington found its way to Sean Morrison at the far post but he could not turn the ball home from two yards. Cardiff boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer needed to do something to shake up his team and he turned to the powerful presence of Jones at half-time, sending him on in place of Nicky Maynard. Jones certainly proved a handful for Wolves' central defenders Richard Stearman and Danny Batth and it was no surprise that Cardiff started to carry more of a threat going forward with Peter Whittingham seeing his 20-yard drive in the 55th-minute turned around the post by Ikeme. Heads you win: Cardiff winger Anthony Pilkington (left) goes up for a header with Wolves' Scott Golbourne . Tackle: Wolves' Nouha Dicko is challenged by Cardiff skipper Mark Hudson, who would go on to score a late own goal . Substitute Guido Bergstaller then had a 76th-minute shot saved by Ikeme, with Cardiff's players appealing strongly for a penalty after the ball appeared to deflect off the arm of Stearman. Whittingham then picked out Jones who was just six yards from goal but his volley was beaten away by Ikeme before Hudson's unfortunate intervention earned Wolves victory in a dramatic finale.","Cardiff captain Mark Hudson slices a Kevin McDonald cross into his own net .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Malaysia Airlines is set to pay £30,000 to the families of passengers who were on board missing flight MH370 but the final amount of compensation will only be paid once the 'issue of the tragedy' is over, it has been reported. The airline is thought to have already paid £3,000 to family members in expenses as they waited in hotels in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing to hear news about their loved ones after the flight went missing in March. The Malaysian government has now set up a committee to oversee the needs of the families of the 239 people who are still missing after boarding the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Scroll down for video . Relatives of Chinese passengers tried to meet with officials of Malaysia Airlines earlier this week but were refused entry to the office in Beijing . The head of the committee, deputy minister of foreign affairs Hamzah Zainuddin, told the Wall Street Journal some of the families had already received the payment but the final amount of compensation is yet to be decided. He added it will only be paid once ‘the issue of the tragedy is over.’ It is thought this can only be determined once the plane is found and a cause of the crash is eventually established. Under international law, Malaysia Airlines and its insurers are liable to pay out around £100,000 per person to families of those on board, however experts have warned the amount of compensation could be subject to a legal battle between the families, the airline and plane manufacturer Boeing. Despite extensive searches of the Southern Indian Ocean off the western coast of Australia, the missing plane, which left Kuala Lumpur on March 8 is yet to be found. It is thought the distraught families of those still missing will receive a payment of £30,000 but final compensation will not come until the 'issue of the tragedy is over' On Wednesday, two dozen relatives of Chinese passengers who were on the missing flight gathered at the airline's regional office in Beijing to demand more information about the plane. Under the tight watch of at least a dozen Chinese police and several building employees, the family members were kept from entering the office building. Relatives say they have been demanding the flight data of the plane, analysis of its possible tracks and videos of the passengers boarding the flight. Earlier this week it was revealed that the Australian government expects to spend around £50 million on the search by July 2015. A Malaysian official has said that the bill will be split evenly between his country and Australia. Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss, right, pictured with Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein declined to say whether the cost of the search of MH370 would be split evenly . However, the Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss declined to say whether this would be the case. He said: ‘I don’t want to give any indication as to where it’s likely to end up. We are talking about this with the Malaysians and other countries who have got a key interest.’ The search area, where it is believed the plane crashed, has changed several times but a group of countries are continuing to negotiate on how to fund the next phase of the sonar search, which will cover an area of 21,600 square miles. Countries involved in the search include Malaysia, Australia, the United States, China, Japan, Britain, South Korea and New Zealand.","Payment has already been made to relatives to those who were on board .

"By . Andy Dolan for the Daily Mail . It wouldn't be a bank holiday weekend without railway engin-eering works, motorway chaos and, of course, a dose of good old gloomy British weather. But even by our low national expectations, forecasters have warned that Monday is shaping up to be a washout. An estimated 14million cars will take to the roads as families return home from the last long weekend of the summer. Backlog: Roadworks will blight 85 sections of motorway, including parts of the M1, M5 and M25 . According to the Highways Agency, roadworks will blight 85 sections of motorway, including parts of the M1, M5 and M25. The RAC predicted that today and tomorrow will be the busiest on the roads, especially as there are major music festivals at Leeds and Reading, adding that traffic was already building yesterday afternoon. But forget jumping on a train – engineering works will also cause delays on rail routes. The worst disruption is expected on the West Coast Mainline, which is closing for work at Watford. Network Rail last night urged passengers travelling between Glasgow and London to seek alternative routes or expect significant delays to journey times. Meanwhile, more than two million Britons will head overseas this weekend to escape the cold and wet – with a quarter flying via Heathrow, according to travel association ABTA. And after a week of unseasonably chilly conditions, there’s little good news for those staying in Britain, as bank holiday temperatures are expected to stay lower than average. John Griffiths, forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: ‘The August average is 23C (73F) in London but we have been stuck around the 20C-21C (68F-70F) mark for the last few days and this is set to continue. ‘Bank holiday Monday is shaping up to be wet across much of the country and the wet weather will stick around for a few days in the south of England.’ Mr Griffiths added that parts of the north and Scotland would escape Monday’s rain, and once the wet weather has passed through, temperatures will increase – although only by a degree or so, remaining below average.","14 million cars will take to the roads as families return from long weekends .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A viola dubbed ‘the finest in existence’ is expected to sell for a record-breaking £27million – making it the most expensive musical instrument in history. The Macdonald is one of just ten violas made by Antonio Stradivari that are still in existence, and the first to be offered on the open market for half a century. It dates back to 1719 and is one of two violas the Italian luthier made during the ‘golden period’ of 1700 to 1720, when he created his finest instruments. Master: Antonio Stradivari (left), the most famous member of his family, crafted the viola (right) in 1719 and it is now said to be the finest in existence anywhere in the world. His name gave rise to the moniker Stradivarius . The Macdonald viola takes its name from Godfrey Bosville, the 3rd Baron Macdonald, who bought it in the 1820s. The instrument, which is slightly larger than a violin, is being sold by Sotheby’s and Ingles & Hayday in a sealed bid auction from now until June. Bids are expected to be in excess of £27million. The . current record is held by the Lady Blunt Stradivarius violin, which was . sold in 2011 for £9.3million to raise money for victims of the Japanese . tsunami. Prestigious: Internationally-renowned violist David Aaron Carpenter has his turn on the £27m piece . Tim Ingles, director of Ingles & Hayday, said: ‘It is immaculately preserved. No Stradivari viola has been on the market for the last fifty years so this is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.’ Antonio Stradivari was an Italian luthier who lived from 1644 until 1737. It is thought just 600 of his violins, 50 cellos and ten violas remain in existence. For the past 200 years, collectors have strived to obtain a Stradivari 'quartet' - two of his violins, a cello and viola. But this has become an almost impossible task because of the number of violas - with the Macdonald one of only two in private hands. Sothebys and Ingles & Hayday yesterday (Weds) described The Macdonald as being of 'incomparable quality' and the sale an 'historic event'. The front is of alpine spruce while the back is of a single piece of maple. Its almost complete coating of Stradivari's famous varnish has remained in a remarkably pure and undamaged state, according to the auctioneers. The consistent rippling flame of the maple slopes downward from left to right, providing a beautiful shifting pattern beneath the varnish. It was last purchased for British-Austrian musician Peter Schidlof of the Amadeus Quartet in 1964 and is being offered for sale by his family after he died in 1987. David Redden, Sotheby's vice chairman, added: 'Every field is defined by one outstanding masterpiece which casts its shadow not only on its own domain but far beyond. 'The instruments of Stradivari are in a class of their own among the pinnacles of human craftsmanship and the Macdonald viola stands at the unquestioned summit.'","1719 Macdonald is one of 10 violas by Antonio Stradivari still in existence .

"By . Emma Innes . Jetlag could soon be a thing of the past thanks to the development of a new ‘light shower’. The American airline Delta has unveiled a ‘photon shower’ that could help passengers recover from jetlag by using light to alter the body’s internal clock. The ‘shower’ allows travellers to input their flight information and it then adjusts to meet their individual needs. Delta has unveiled a 'photon shower' that could help passengers recover from jetlag by using light to alter the body's internal clock . It is a light chamber that was . designed by Delta’s advertising agency, Wieden + Kennedy New York, and . is the result of neuroscience and sleep research by Dr Russell Foster, . from the University of Oxford. The idea came about after Dr Foster gave a talk about how light can be used to realign our body clocks when we are jetlagged. ‘He casually suggested that people might . someday 'bathe in light' in a kind of 'photon shower' in order to help . their jet-lagged brains recover. Even celebrities are interested in the 'light shower': Harry Shum, who plays Mike Chang in TV series Glee, tried it out at the TED Conference . 'This lit up our imaginations immediately,’ said W+K representative, Catherine McCurry. The breakthrough could mean an end to jetlag for frequent travellers . ‘We . started sketching some designs of what that might be like. We pitched . it to our client, got the green light, brought London production company . Nexus on board, and started making the photon shower a reality,’ she . added. The ‘shower’, which was exhibited at the TED Long Beach Conference in California last week, works by creating a light sequence that recreates the effect of sunlight. In this way it alleviates jetlag and provides a pick-me-up for tired travellers. Building a photon shower, the first of its kind, was a complex undertaking, the team said. ‘Not only was there the build of the . physical structure, there was the app to run the device, there was . animation that had to be created to project the blue light in an elegant . way, there was an algorithm that had to be developed to create custom . jet-lag therapy calendars that users could take home, all the way down . to a very specific sound design,’ explains W+K employee Jamie Carreiro. He . added: ‘Our partners at Q Department created synesthetic ambient audio . derived from the exact light wavelength used in the installation itself. It was a delightfully multimedia process. ‘When you step inside, the small structure of the shower disappears, and the environment becomes surprisingly expansive. ‘Using an infinity mirror setup, we made the space feel much larger than it actually is.’ When . someone enters the ‘shower’ they are asked to input their flight . information and they are then guided through the experience by a . narrator. The 'light shower' (pictured from the outside) works by creating a light sequence that recreates the effect of sunlight . Ms McCurry said: ‘Flowing blue animations appear before you on the LED wall. 'They’re particularly impactful because these LED panels are typically used for large on-stage displays, so being right up close to a screen like this is really rare. 'It has a strong effect. ‘At times, it really feels like it’s raining light.’ It is believed that the light box could eventually find its way into the home as it could give a pick-me-up to tired partiers or to people who work night shifts. Delta might eventually offer the ‘shower’ to passengers as a way of improving the flying experience.","U.S. airline Delta has created 'photon shower' that could treat jetlag .

Leading the team will be Toronado, who goes head-to-head with Gosden’s Irish 2,000 Guineas and St James’s Palace Stakes winner Kingman in the Qipco Sussex Stakes. That is the heavyweight clash of the meeting and one in which Hannon snr thinks his side can come out on top. Hannon snr said: ‘Richard is only about £40,000 behind and a couple of nice winners at Goodwood would make a big difference. Leader: Hannon Jnr's big name horse at Glorious Goodwood will be Toronado, who will be up against Kingman . ‘Toronado hasn’t been easy. He has had two wind operations and he blew up half a furlong from home when he won the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot last month. ‘He is in good form and is as good a horse as we have had here – definitely on a par with (2010 Sussex Stakes winner) Canford Cliffs. ‘I am also not sure Kingman will like the track.

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . Graeme McDowell believes Rory McIlroy can win as many major titles as he wants, as long as he remains healthy and motivated. McIlroy claimed his second major in the space of four weeks and fourth of his career in the US PGA Championship on Sunday, becoming the first player to win back-to-back titles since Padraig Harrington in 2008. The 25-year-old is the third youngest player behind Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus to win four majors and will travel to Augusta next April seeking to complete the career Grand Slam, not to mention remaining on course to hold all four major titles at the same time. VIDEO Scroll down to watch US PGA & The Open Championship highlights . More to come: Rory McIlroy can win as many majors as he wants, according to Graeme McDowell . Sealed with a kiss: McIlroy celebrates winning his fourth major at the US PGA Championships on Sunday . VIDEO PGA Championship highlights . Woods is the only player to achieve that feat by winning the US Open, Open and US PGA in 2000 and the Masters in 2001. 'It's beginning to look a little Tiger-esque I suppose,' McDowell said of McIlroy's winning streak, which includes a first World Golf Championship event sandwiched between the Open and US PGA. 'I said at the Open I didn't think we were going to see someone creating their own kind of Tiger-esque era just yet. I'm not eating my words but guess you could say I'm certainly starting to chew on them right now. When the kid is playing well, he's pretty tough to live with. It's pretty special stuff.' McIlroy admits that his split from fiancee Caroline Wozniacki has proven to be good for his golf, winning the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth just days after calling off their wedding and reaping the rewards of making golf his number one priority.

Double: And he couldn't take his eyes off his second US PGA title . 'He says that he's sort of tied up a lot of his loose ends off the golf course,' McDowell added of his former stablemate. 'Loose ends is not a very nice term to put your personal life and I don't mean it like that, but he seems to be in a very good place. 'He's an incredible player and when he's in this type of mood, he's pretty tough to beat.' Asked if McIlroy could match Woods' total of 14 majors or the 18 of Jack Nicklaus, former US Open champion McDowell added: 'Not many people are born with the type of focus Tiger Woods had, growing up with pictures of Jack Nicklaus on his wall and wanting to beat Jack's record. 'Knowing Rory as I have the last few years, it didn't seem to me like he was trying to beat Jack's record. So it's a case of how the guy continues to motivate himself. You don't know what the number is. It's however many he wants. He'll win as many majors as he wants, within reason. 'Rory has obviously got himself in amazing shape physically now as well and it's just a case of how fit and healthy he can stay. No doubt the game is more physical now.

"By . Laurie Whitwell for MailOnline . Henri Lansbury has penned a new three-year deal at Nottingham Forest after the club put forward fresh terms making him one of their top earners. Burnley were keen on the central midfielder, who was interested by a move to the Premier League, but he has committed his future to Forest after this week being offered an improved deal from the one on the table since February. It is understood Burnley contemplated raising the funds for a £4million offer at the eleventh hour on Thursday night, having had a £3.5m bid previously rejected, but ultimately failed to do so. Going nowhere: Henri Lansbury has penned a new three-year contract at Nottingham Forest . Forest’s excellent start to the season and Stuart Pearce’s words of persuasion were enough to convince Lansbury, one of the Championship's stand-out performers, to sign up. The 23-year-old had declined to put pen to paper on the contract previously offered by owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi but the deal negotiated this week is a substantial improvement and matches what Burnley could have afforded. ‘His dream will be to play in the Premier League and play international football,’ said Pearce. ‘Maybe he now sees that he is at a football club where he could get that opportunity, without having to move. ‘I am just pleased that players want to commit themselves, for the longer term, to this football club.’ Lansbury is yet to make an appearance this season after picking up an injury in a friendly against Porto B last month. He played in a practice match on Thursday and is expected to return to full fitness soon. No go: Burnley had a £3.5million bid for Lansbury (left) rejected by Forest .

"By . Mark Bryans, Press Association . Sam Allardyce is aiming to break West Ham's losing streak over Crystal Palace - but is expecting a tough challenge from a side still likely to play the 'Tony Pulis' way. Former manager Pulis left Selhurt Park less than 48 hours before the start of the new Barclays Premier League season, with Keith Millen taking charge of Saturday's narrow 2-1 defeat at Arsenal. With the furore surrounding Malky Mackay's ongoing wranglings with former club Cardiff, the Scot will no longer be filling the vacancy. Hoodoo: West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is all too aware of his team's recent poor form against Saturday's opponents Crystal Palace. The Eagles are unbeaten since 2003 in fixtures between the sides . Still in charge: Keith Millen is once again likely to take charge of Crystal Palace for the match at Selhurst Park . That means Millen is once again likely to be in charge of first-team affairs for the visit of West Ham - with the Eagles having won four of the last six meetings and remaining unbeaten in the fixture since 2003. But Allardyce, who is struggling with early season injuries and suspension to his defensive line, is hopeful of overcoming their recent south London hoodoo. 'I think they have some better players than last season but they very much stick to the same type of structural organisation,' he said. 'We didn't beat them last year and it will be just as difficult, if not more so, with the players they've brought in. 'The new players have lots of Premier League experience and from that point of view we'll have a tough job. 'There's still lots of excitement around the ground and the stadium, the players know their position now, they know what their job is. At the start of last season they found it difficult to cope with the league, but Tony Pulis came in and structured it accordingly. Defeated: Palace lost their opening match 2-1 against Arsenal, despite Brede Hangeland's headed opener . Late agony: West Ham lost out to a stoppage time Tottenham goal in their opening fixture . 'It'll be a tight game. I don't think there'll be many goals in it, but hopefully it'll be as entertaining as it possibly can be.' The Hammers slipped to two 1-0 defeats at the hands of Palace last season and went on to finish two places lower than the Eagles' final position of 11th. With debutants Aaron Cresswell and Cheikhou Kouyate impressing in the last-gasp defeat to Tottenham last week, Allardyce could hand either Enner Valencia or Diafra Sakho their first starts for the club on Saturday. But, after bolstering his attacking options over the summer, it is in defence where Allardyce will be weakened - with James Collins banned and James Tomkins, Joey O'Brien and Carl Jenkinson unlikely to be completely match fit. First start? Summer signing Enner Valencia could make his first appearance in the West Ham starting XI . New boy: Diafra Sakho could also be handed his first start for West Ham at Selhurst Park . Republic of Ireland international O'Brien is hoping the managerial uncertainty can see the Hammers turn the tables this season. 'Palace did a number on us twice last year, so we want to get one back,' he said. 'In that first year in the Premier League you might wonder what to expect from them, but now everyone knows their players and the situations they create. We know what to expect this year. 'I don't know whether the managerial situation there will affect the players. I watched their game against Arsenal last week and they played really well - they were unlucky to lose the game, so it's a home game for them, their fans will be up for the first home game of the season and we'll have to play at our best.'

"By . Sean Gallagher for MailOnline . West Ham manager Sam Allardyce says he is not shocked with comparisons made between new signing Cheikhou Kouyate and Patrick Vieira after his impressive debut against Tottenham on Saturday. The 24-year-old, who joined for a reported £7million from Anderlecht earlier this summer, was the Hammers' star performer in the narrow defeat with his pace and power a constant thorn in the home side's midfield. And his new manager was understandably delighted with Kouyate's first performance for the Irons. Impressive: Kouyate was West Ham's star performer as they fell to a narrow defeat against Spurs . Powerful: Kouyate has plenty of pace and power in his locker . Similarities:  Kouyate has many characteristics that Patrick Vieira had as a player . Impressed: Allardyce has drawn comparisons with Kouyate and Vieira . In his column for the Evening Standard Allardyce said: 'I thought he (Cheikhou) was our man-of-the-match against Tottenham last week and I, for one, would be delighted if he came close to emulating Patrick's consistent level of performance. 'It was a brilliant debut and one which you don't see too often in the Premier League. 'Normally, when players first come here from abroad, they're shouting for pure oxygen because they struggle to cope with the sheer intensity of our game. 'Apart from right at the end against Spurs, when he did go down for a rest after yet another run, his fitness was superb — and infectious because the rest of the players will be saying to themselves: 'Come on, I've got to get up there with him.' Allardyce will be hoping for more of the same of Kouyate's infectious displays from the rest of his squad as they look to bounce back from defeat to Spurs when they make the short trip to managerless Crystal Palace on Saturday.","Allardyce is not surprised that Kouyate has drawn comparisons with the former Arsenal midfielder .

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . He succeeded where both Kris Boyd and Kenny Miller have so far failed by grabbing a first competitive goal of the season. And after coming off the bench to notch the killer second in an unconvincing 2-0 win at Falkirk on Friday night, Nicky Clark vowed he is ready to step in for the injured Miller who limped off with a tight hamstring at Westfield and will miss Monday night’s Petrofac Training Cup clash with Barry Ferguson’s Clyde at Ibrox. ‘Hopefully Kenny Miller is all right because he is a massive player for us,’ said Clark. ‘He also has great experience to give to the team. But if he is going to be out then it is a chance for me to come into the team and do well. Looking up: Nicky Clark says he is ready to take lead for Rangers after scoring against Falkirk in the 2-0 win . ‘And I was pleased with my performance when I got on. I felt I got in behind Falkirk, I turned their defence and in the end I grabbed a goal.’ However, Clark nearly found himself cast in the role of villain when, with the score still goalless, he headed a great chance from six yards straight at Falkirk keeper Jamie McDonald. After Lewis Macleod put Rangers ahead with a wickedly deflected shot, Clark made amends by applying the finishing touch to a shot from Nicky Law that already looked net-bound. ‘I needed to do better with that header I missed,’ nodded Clark. ‘I just tried to go back across goal with it and their keeper has saved the ball. But luckily enough I’ve got another chance and scored it. ‘Nicky Law hasn’t said anything to me about stealing his goal bonus! I wasn’t even sure his shot was going in. Anyway it’s my job as a striker to score goals and that’s what I’ve done tonight. I had to put the ball in the net.’ Chase: Clark netted the killer second against Falkirk and is hopeful of being called up to face Clyde on Monday . Clark admitted Rangers flattered to deceive for large spells. With a return to the Premiership the ultimate goal, however, the former Queen of the South striker says points are more valuable than performances. ‘It was a relief when the first goal went in, yes. I felt we huffed and puffed at the start of the match but the longer the game went on the more we came into it. ‘We created a few chances, and we maybe got a bit lucky with the first goal that went in via a deflection from Lewis Macleod. But getting three points is the most important thing. Yes it would be nice to go out and play attractive, attacking football but teams come and stop you from doing that. So we will take it even if we have to win ugly. ‘I think it’s going to be tough like this every week in the Championship. There are teams like Hearts and Hibs - and Falkirk proved they are a very good side, too. So are Queen of the South and Livingston. ‘It’s a massive step up from Leagues One and Two because there are only two or three teams who aren’t full time. We’ve been used to playing part-time teams so the fitness levels of the opposition will be much higher. But that’s something we will have to deal with.’ Challenge: Clark says it is a 'massive step up from Leagues One and Two' and it will be tough for Rangers .","Nicky Clark scores second killer goal in 2-0 win over Falkirk on Friday night .

"By . Laurie Whitwell for MailOnline . Dermot Drummy is a name not many fans of Crystal Palace will recognise but the 53-year-old is as low as 5/1 with some bookmakers to become the next manager at Selhurst Park. It is believed he is back on the radar after talks last week and is a genuine option for Palace co-owner Steve Parish despite being a relative unknown. Because scratching a little deeper shows Drummy has coaching credentials to rival the early career of Brendan Rodgers, and some of the big names in the Premier League have been assisted by his guiding hand. Who is he? Drummy has worked for Arsenal and Chelsea and is being considered for the vacant Palace job . Enough of all that – just who is he? Drummy is the international head coach at Chelsea . Sounds a little like Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. Sure, not quite. Instead his role is to teach the coaches from the Chelsea Foundation across the globe, notably at soccer schools in China and America. But before that he was in charge of Chelsea’s successful youth team. Tell me more… . Drummy originally joined Chelsea from Arsenal’s academy in 2008 and assisted Paul Clement on the side’s run to that year's FA Youth Cup final. He took over when Clement moved up to become assistant to Guus Hiddink (then Carlo Ancelotti) and then oversaw the development of the likes of Ryan Bertrand and Romelu Lukaku. What was his record like? In his first full season in the job he brought the FA Youth Cup to Stamford Bridge for the first time since 1961, beating Aston Villa over two legs and then took over Steve Holland’s position as reserve team manager, incorporating the two roles. Well done: Drummy congratulates Chelsea U21 captain Lewis Baker during a successful season . In 2012/13 his team reached the NextGen Series final, beating Barcelona, Ajax, Juventus and Arsenal beaten before losing to Villa in Italy, and last season he lifted the Under-21 Premier League by defeating Manchester City and Manchester United. His career management record stands at 51 per cent. It is claimed he is the most decorated development coach in Chelsea’s history, ahead of Rodger, Clement, Holland and Steve Clarke. All sound very impressive, has he any first-team experience? Yes. Jose Mourinho has entrusted him with coaching duties during international breaks, with the likes of John Terry, Frank Lampard, and Eden Hazard under his guidance. Trust: Under Jose Mourinho Drummy was left alone to coach the likes of John Terry and Eden Hazard . Did he have any playing career himself? Indeed he did. He began at Arsenal aged 13, playing in the same youth sides as Paul Davis and Chris Whyte, later a league champion with Leeds, but was released six years later. He moved to Blackpool in Division Two and then went semi-professional at Hendon, Wealdstone and Enfield, retiring at 35. Development: Both Kieran Gibbs and Jack Wilshere were coached by Drummy in his time at Arsenal . As an apprentice he had cleaned the boots of Liam Brady, who by now was academy director at Arsenal and offered his former friend a job coaching the Under-16s. Drummy would coach Jermaine Pennant, Johan Djourou, Nicklas Bendtner and more recently Jack Wilshere and Kieran Gibbs.","Drummy held talks with the club last week .

"By . Robin Cottle for MailOnline . Rangers boss Ally McCoist stressed he had had no contact with Crystal Palace over their managerial vacancy after Saturday's 4-1 win against Dumbarton. McCoist claimed he did not know where reports linking him with Selhurst Park had come from, and insisted he already had an important job on his hands. 'There has been no contact at all with Crystal Palace,' he said. 'As you can imagine, I have a serious amount of work to do here and anyone who knows me will appreciate it is important to see it through. Staying put: Ally McCoist has dismissed speculation linking him with the vacant Crystal Palace job . Points secure: Nicky Clark scores Rangers' third goal against Dumbarton . 'The most immediate job is to get us out of this division. I'm desperate to do that as quickly as possible and my short and long-term job is to do that. 'It is flattering, and maybe Rangers' story coming through the divisions catches the attention, but I'm desperately keen to get the job here completed.' Turning to his side's 4-1 win over Dumbarton, McCoist was more forthcoming. First-half goals from Lee McCulloch and Darren McGregor set Rangers up for another home win on the back of Monday's 8-1 hammering of Clyde. And although it was a gutsy performance from Dumbarton, a second-half strike from Nicky Clark and an own goal from Chris Turner left Ian Murray's team on the wrong end of another crushing defeat - with only a Bilel Mohsni own goal for consolation. Job to finish: McCoist chats with striker Kris Boyd at the training ground . Celebration time: Lee McCulloch (no.6) celebrates scoring Rangers' opener . Make that four: Rangers walk back to the centre circle after scoring a fourth goal, an own goal by Dumbarton's Chris Turner . After making it two home wins in a week and scoring 12 goals in the process, the Rangers boss was delighted to keep the momentum going.

'I said to the players at half-time that it was only 2-0 and we could maybe have a chance with the next goal. But we lose another on the break and then when it goes to 4-0 you get a bit worried.

The Dumbarton manager did not want to dwell on the incident involving Mohsni and Agnew, but accepted it might have influenced proceedings. 'My initial reaction was that Agnew was through and Mohsni was the last man, but I don't want to see players sent off and maybe the ref has called it right,' he said.","Rangers boss Ally McCoist has distanced himself from rumours he's in the running to take the vacant Crystal Palace job .

"By . Sam Cunningham for The Mail on Sunday . John O'Shea is still getting used to the sight of his old team-mate Ryan Giggs in the Manchester United dugout. When the Sunderland defender lines up against United on Sunday, Giggs will be the only familiar face still remaining from his 12 years at the club. But O’Shea is just glad he no longer has to try to stop the flying Welshman. ‘You would try anything,’ he said with a laugh. 'It will be strange, especially seeing him in that coaching role. Strange: John O'Shea says he is still getting used to seeing Ryan Giggs in the Manchester United dugout . We meet again: The Sunderland defender lines up against United on Sunday with Giggs a familiar face . ‘It was weird going down to Old Trafford last season and seeing him as the manager. It was incredible, you know, but I’m sure it’s given him a taste of what’s to come.’ The Republic of Ireland defender was not about to do Giggs any favours when the latter took temporary charge at United for four games at the end of last season. His first match was a 4-0 win against Norwich but in the second they were up against a Sunderland side scrapping desperately for Premier League survival, captained by O’Shea. Sunderland recorded a shock 1-0 win that helped keep them up and piled more misery on United’s dismal season. ‘When we won there it wasn’t nice for Giggsy in that sense when he was the manager, but for us it was so crucial for Premier League survival last season. That was a special day,’ he said. O’Shea’s suggestion that Giggs will one day become United manager is perhaps indicative of the new United. More than a quarter of a century of stability under Sir Alex Ferguson was ripped apart by David Moyes’s disastrous reign. Louis van Gaal has only been at the helm for three months but there is already supporter unrest after their opening day defeat by Swansea, and that will grow considerably if they do not beat Sunderland on Sunday. Play: O'Shea admits ‘it was weird going down to Old Trafford last season and seeing (Giggs) as the manager' Battle: O'Shea and Giggs will go head-to-head again on Sunday as United visit the Stadium of Light . It's not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football. There's £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest-scoring manager . But the club are virtually unrecognisable to the one where O’Shea won five League titles, a Champions League trophy, an FA Cup and three League Cups. There is no Paul Scholes, no Nemanja Vidic, no Rio Ferdinand or Patrice Evra, players O’Shea spent almost every day with — in training, on the pitch and travelling the world pillaging silverware. ‘They’ve lost a lot of experience along the way,’ O’Shea explained. ‘It’s going to be an interesting season, everyone is waiting to see how they’re doing I’m sure they’ll be looking to definitely get back to the top side of the table. ‘Expectation levels are always sky high and that won’t change. Obviously, after last season, people are saying, “Oh, they need to get to the top four, they need to get this.” Expectation is always very high, they always expect to be challenging for every trophy and that won’t change with last season and with the new rivals along the way. ‘They’ve got a very experienced manager who has been successful wherever he’s been. He looks a great character when he’s being interviewed. He came across very well with the Dutch team during the World Cup. I’m sure they’ll be excited they’ve made one or two additions to their squad.’ O’Shea, 33, has his own new addition this summer with the birth of his daughter, Ruby, on May 1, to add to his son Alfie. He hasn’t let it affect his pre-season preparation, though. ‘That is where there is an advantage of being able to shift the family back to Ireland for a couple of weeks,’ he added. ‘Back to see the family and the grandparents.’ Even without Giggs in Van Gaal’s the starting XI, or any of the players O’Shea spent those golden years with, he will need to be at his freshest on Sunday afternoon. Once upon a time: United have somewhat changed since O'Shea's time at the club with players departing .

United began the season with an opening day defeat by Swansea at Old Trafford and legendary midfielder Paul Scholes has admitted that he is 'scared' for the club's future. Irwin, however, believes that Van Gaal can turn things round and improve upon David Moyes' traumatic season, in which United slumped to a 7th placed finish. Reunited: Former team-mates Irwin and Cole pictured with children at the launch of Apollo Tyres . Iconic: Irwin, Cole and the children gather on the pitch right next to Old Trafford . Opening: Irwin and Cole cut the ribbon at the opening of Apollo Tyres in Manchester . 'We've had 23 years of success, we need a little bit of patience,' Irwin said. 'You should not forget that we had years within that when we didn't win anything. Before the Swansea game, you could feel the optimism around the club. 'It wasn't a great performance and it was a poor result but hopefully, moving forward we can forget about that. We had a real poor year by our standards last season and I've no doubt that we will be an awful lot better this year. 'I think we have a manager who has a fantastic record of success of not only bringing players in but also using young players. He has managed some of the top clubs in the world - Barcelona, Bayern, Holland at the World Cup - he did great things with AZ a few years ago as well.' United have recruited Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera and Marcos Rojo in the summer transfer window and the club have come under pressure to bring in further reinforcements before the end of the month. Faith: Irwin has no doubt Van Gaal will succeed at United but insists the fans must give their full support to him . All smiles: Irwin and Cole remain highly regarded by United after excellent spells at the club . 'We have to trust the manager,' Irwin maintained. 'It is good he has bought Rojo. He's a strong boy, a good athlete, looks a good defender as well. It's fantastic that he is moving here. He knows what he wants, he's had a good look at everybody. 'He's only been in a month. He is still getting to know the players, it will take time to get to know the players and put his views across. 'At some point over the coming year or two, we will need to strengthen but it will be down to the manager to identify that.' Irwin, does, however believe that United must target a return to European football this season adding: 'I don't think there is any set agenda but Champions League has been part and parcel of this club for 20 years or so. We will certainly miss that.'","The former United defender says the Old Trafford faithful must give Louis van Gaal time to settle in to his new role .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . The morning after a dismal Champions League defeat to Legia Warsaw, Ronny Deila woke early from a fitful sleep. ‘Deila M for Murder’ was the headline in one national newspaper. It reflected the Norwegian’s mood perfectly. There was no blood on the walls. No one had died. Yet Celtic’s manager felt as if he had woken from a nightmare of Hitchcock proportions. Lifeline: Ronny Deila is determined to take advantage of Celtic's Champions League lifeline . ‘I felt as if I’d killed someone when I woke up,’ he told Sportsmail yesterday. ‘That’s how it is every time I lose a match. ‘If you don’t hurt when you lose matches, something’s wrong. That’s the worst feeling in football, waking up the morning after a defeat.’ Celtic had lost more than their reputation as an established Champions League club in the course of a 6-1 aggregate defeat to the Polish champions. They had also lost a vital source of revenue. Celtic’s plc board don’t budget for reaching UEFA’s group stages. They would have coped with going out. But the huge, unexpected stroke of luck offered by a Legia Warsaw registration error has resurrected the prospect of a £15million windfall for the Parkhead club. For Deila, it’s the difference between finally signing a player of pedigree or bringing in more jersey fillers. In the aftermath of the Murrayfield debacle — that second-leg 2-0 defeat — he spoke of rebuilding his team from scratch. He has since backtracked, realising perhaps that he doesn’t have that luxury. Instead he has to get the best from what he has. Telling the existing squad they were finished was the mistake of a man running on empty. A new coach at a new club, in a new city, in a new country, Deila felt exhausted and probably a little overwhelmed post-Legia. There was an admission yesterday that he may not have been fully on top of his brief. Preparation: The squad are in Slovenia preparing for the first leg of their play-off against Maribor . ‘It was a very difficult position to be in,’ he said. ‘I had only been at the club for four weeks and we had been pushed into it. But you learn quick in this job. I also felt tired after the game because I think I had maybe pushed myself too much. ‘The first day was very hard but you have to admit what level you are at. On that day, we were at that level and had to work from there. ‘I feel very different right now. I had done a lot of work and a lot of travelling, and I didn’t know many people. Now I know my team, I have got my head up and I have control of the situation.’ The first he heard of what proved to be an incredible Champions League lifeline was when a journalist called him later that night. Legia tried everything to overturn UEFA’s decision to award Celtic a 3-0 second-leg win after Bartosz Bereszynski played the final minutes of that match while suspended. It was a genuine mistake, but a hugely costly one. It was also an enormously fortuitous break for Celtic. One Deila feels duty bound now to take advantage of against Maribor on Wednesday. Discussion: Deila in talks with assistant John Collins about their plan of action . ‘I didn’t feel anything when I was told we could be back in,’ Deila said. ‘My focus is always on football. It’s about performances, whether you get the chance or not. When we perform, we achieve things. We have got a second chance and we will do everything to take it. ‘I know now where we are going and I know how we are going to improve. Now we have a chance to see how far we have improved in 14 days. I am confident that we are going to reach the right level as we showed on Saturday. ‘I think we are in a good mood in the group. They are training good and have responded fantastically. Everyone is doing everything they can to improve every day.’ Against Legia, of course, the real damage was done away from home in Warsaw with a dire 4-1 loss. ‘Yes, I made mistakes in Warsaw,’ admitted the Norwegian. ‘What were they? We’ll see.’ It’s unlikely, this time, he will be as tactically gung-ho. Square pegs occupied round holes in the Pepsi Arena that night and the Celtic coach is less likely to make the same selection errors this time. ‘The first time we went into the Champions League I hadn’t been long with the players,’ he conceded. ‘I feel more comfortable with them now — I know what kind of team I have. I know the strengths of the players now. ‘Also they are looking in good shape. They are fitter than in the last match and have adapted more. ‘So that puts us in a better position than we had the last time.’ All smiles: Striker Anthony Stokes in high spirits in training ahead of the game . The Warsaw result might have been an acceptable narrow defeat but for a late collapse. From 2-1 with six minutes remaining, it finished 4-1, rendering the second leg a hopeless act of futility against a better team. Champions of Slovenia for the last four years, it is likely Maribor will look at the videos of Legia and fancy their chances. Understandably. In recent years, they have toppled Rangers and Hibs and have individuals with technical ability. But Deila’s aim is to fly back to Glasgow with the tie still alive. With a fighting chance. ‘You have to think long term of course,’ he admitted. ‘But now, in the short term, everything is about a result. I’m much better now than I was and I think the players have adapted.’ For all the positive signs against Dundee United at the weekend, there are dangers in reading too much into domestic football. Recent European results show that the SPFL lacks the financial clout to compete at this level. Celtic have managed to add players — and Craig Gordon, Jason Denayer and Jo Inge Berget show signs of adapting quickly. But Aleksandar Tonev didn’t travel here, while Ghanaian Wakaso Mubarak was last night scrambling to clear up the red tape which would allow him to feature. It is also the case that injuries to James Forrest and Adam Matthews are a nuisance Deila could do without. Buoyed by that 6-1 thrashing of United, however, he insisted: ‘They showed they are at a better level than they were away to Legia. Small things can make a big difference and I think those small things are going more in our favour now than they were in Warsaw. ‘We are more prepared and I have a good feeling that we can make a good performance and get a result to take home to Glasgow.’","Celtic set to face Maribor in Champions League play-off on Wednesday .

"By . Phil Medlicott, Press Association . Former Arsenal midfielder Ray Parlour can see plenty to suggest the club will improve on last season's efforts in 2014/15 - but is not betting on Arsene Wenger's side winning the Premier League title. The Gunners once again finished fourth in the top flight in 2013/14, but also ended a nine-year trophy drought by triumphing in the FA Cup final. Since then, their squad has been boosted by signings like Chile's World Cup forward Alexis Sanchez and France defender Mathieu Debuchy. And with Arsenal preparing for this weekend's Premier League kick-off off the back of a 3-0 victory over reigning champions Manchester City in the Community Shield, a sense of optimism about what Wenger's men can achieve this time out has continued to grow among the club's fans. Improvement: Ray Parlour says this Arsenal team has improved over the last 12 months . That feeling is certainly shared by Parlour, who thinks Sanchez is 'perfect' for the division. But for all that is coming together in promising fashion at the Emirates Stadium, the 41-year-old ex-England international believes either Chelsea or City are likely to end up top of the pile. Parlour said: 'I think the bookmakers get it right a lot of the time and Chelsea and Manchester City are probably joint favourites. 'I think Manchester United will have a better season, and there's Liverpool as well. That league is such a tough league. 'In terms of who Arsenal have bought, I was sorry to see Bacary Sagna go as he was a good right-back, but Debuchy is in front of Sagna in the France side so that was a good replacement. New boy: Parlour was sorry to see Bacary Sagna go but believes Debuchy is a more than capable replacement . 'I watched Sanchez in the World Cup and he is definitely a player who can excite the fans and is always involved. 'He got kicked a lot in the games and showed his mettle by getting up straight away and carrying on. So I think he would be perfect for the Premier League. 'If they can get one or two more in before the end of this transfer window, then they will have a good squad, and their players are at good ages, in midfield especially. 'Mesut Ozil, Aaron Ramsey, Jack Wilshere - all these top players are at a good age and they should be maturing every single year. Mature: The former Gunner said that Arsenal have a number of players who are maturing at the right time . VIDEO Arsenal keen to push on . 'I am really pleased they won a trophy last season - that was so important for Arsene Wenger. 'He knew the pressure, and for the players, that first trophy is always the hardest to win. Hopefully they can push on now. 'But if you look at all the squads, Man City and Chelsea are stronger. 'I'm hoping Arsenal can be up there. I'm always optimistic. 'But if you were putting your money where your mouth was, you can't look further probably than Man City or Chelsea.'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . and Graham Warwick, Science Uncovered . In the 1960s, it seemed like the future of air travel was supersonic, but in 2003 Concorde made its final flight. Now, hopes for super speedy journeys by air have been rekindled as a number of companies have unveiled concepts for supersonic jets of the future. The concepts coincide with Nasa tests that are hoping to find a way to create an aircraft that is quieter than Concorde. It is hoped new supersonic aeroplanes designed to carry civilian passengers could be ready within the next 15 years. Is the future supersonic? Hopes for super speedy journeys by air have been rekindled as a number of companies, including Boeing (pictured) have unveiled concepts for supersonic jets of the future, and Nasa has begun tests to work out a way of creating an aircraft that is not as noisy as Concorde was . In a conventional supersonic aircraft, shockwaves from the nose, cockpit, inlets, wings and other features come together as they move through the atmosphere into strong shocks emanating from the nose and tail. These are known as bow and tail shocks, respectively. As these shockwaves pass over someone on the ground, air pressure rises sharply, declines, then rises rapidly again - it’s this that produces the classic ‘double-bang’ sonic boom. Reshaping the aircraft to produce a longer, more slender shape that slips through the air is the best way to generate shockwaves of lower, more equal strength that attenuate as they pass through the atmosphere and do not form into such strong bow and tail shocks. Stretching the nose to break the bow shock into a series of weaker shockwaves is particularly effective. This lowers and spreads that initial pressure peak and softens the first bang of the sonic boom. Aeronautics engineers at Nasa are working to define a new standard for low sonic booms and are presenting their work at Aviation 2014, the annual event of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, in Atlanta. They have been busy gathering data in order to create new, quieter planes that could help overturn the current ban on supersonic flight over land. ‘Lessening sonic booms - shock waves caused by an aircraft flying faster than the speed of sound - is the most significant hurdle to reintroducing commercial supersonic flight,’ said Peter Coen, head of the High Speed Project in Nasa’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, Washington. ‘Other barriers include high altitude emissions, fuel efficiency and community noise around airports.’ Aeronautics engineers at Nasa are working to define a new standard for low sonic booms. They have flown F/A-18 mission support aircraft (pictured) to create low-intensity sonic booms in a bid to gauge the public's tolerance to noise at the agency's Armstrong Flight Research Centre in Edwards, California . In a supersonic aircraft, shockwaves from the nose, cockpit, inlets, wings and other features coalesce as they move through the atmosphere. As these shockwaves pass over someone on the ground, air pressure rises sharply, declines, then rises rapidly again. This produces the 'double-bang' sonic boom . Engineers are investigating how to design a low-boom aircraft, as well as measuring the loudness and the annoyance of the boom, by asking people to listen to the sounds in a specially designed noise test chamber. The space agency recently flew small planes at supersonic speeds at Nasa’s Armstrong Flight Research Centre in Edwards, California, to gauge the public’s response to the noise. Scientists are also working on how to design aircraft that reduce the noise of the sonic boom. Mike Park, a fluid mechanics engineer at Langley, said: ‘We are working to understand the worldwide state of the art in predicting sonic booms from an aircraft point of view. ‘We found for simple configurations we can analyse and predict sonic booms extremely well. For complex configurations we still have some work to do.’ Designs including a needle-like nose, sleek fuselage, and a delta wing have been tested in wind tunnels and seem to result in lower booms, according to the experts. It's more than a decade since Concorde (pictured) was retired from service. No company will build a supersonic passenger plane unless it is allowed to fly supersonically over land - something that was off-limits for Concorde . 'Lessening sonic booms - shock waves caused by an aircraft flying faster than the speed of sound - is the most significant hurdle to reintroducing commercial supersonic flight,' said Nasa's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate. Pictured is Lockheed Martin's design for a supersonic aircraft . Sonic boom noise is measured in perceived decibel level (PLdB). Concorde’s boom was a window-rattling 105 PLdB. Researchers believe 75 PLdB would be an acceptable level for unrestricted supersonic flight over land, but Nasa is aiming more ambitiously for 70 PLdB or lower. This looks achievable for a small supersonic business jet, because boom is proportional to aircraft weight, but is a much greater challenge for a heavier airliner. In wind-tunnel tests, designs from both Boeing and Lockheed Martin - funded by Nasa - which would carry between 30 and 80 passengers, achieved boom levels as low as 79 PLdB. At this level, the sonic boom would be more of a thump than a loud bang. Nasa is setting the bar even higher - it thinks 70 PLdB is achievable with more refinement. Studies are still taking place to try to reduce the volume level even further. Nasa and industry engineers claim supersonic research has progressed to the point where the design of a practical low-boom supersonic jet is within reach. Nasa and industry engineers say they believe supersonic research has progressed to the point where the design of a practical low-boom supersonic jet is within reach. Here Lockheed Martin's design, with a long needle-like nose and delta wing intended to cut the noise of a sonic boom, is tested in a wind tunnel . The space agency is not the only firm working on building the supersonic jet of the future. Companies such as Aerion and Spike Aerospace are looking to take business jets supersonic. Boston-based Spike Aerospace has designed a supersonic jet called the Spike S-512 that it claims could carry 12 to 18 passengers at 1,100mph (1,700 km/h), or Mach 1.6. It claims the craft could cut flight times in half so passengers could fly from New York to London in just three hours, of from LA to Tokyo in six hours. Lockheed Martin unveiled its vision for a supersonic future at the aviation event, with a concept featuring two engines under a sleek aircraft’s wings and one on top of the fuselage. Once Virgin Galactic is fully operational, Richard Branson has also set his sights on supersonic travel and has plans to create supersonic planes aircraft enough to travel from New York to Tokyo in less than an hour, CNBC reported. ‘After we've done the space program, we will be producing supersonic planes, which will go far, far, faster than Concorde…You could be traveling at 19,000 miles per hour orbitally,’ he said. Supersonic could be superseded by something even faster. Mach . 2.5 is about the speed limit for gas-turbine engines. Any faster and . the temperature and pressure of air entering the engine is too high for . the turbo machinery inside. To fly at hypersonic speed - Mach 5 and . above - requires a different type of engine. A . supersonic-combustion ramjet, or scramjet, has no moving parts. Instead . of the rotating compressor and turbine in a jet engine, air is . compressed and expanded by complex systems of shockwaves under the front . of the aircraft, inside the inlet and under the fuselage at the rear. Scramjets have . been under development for decades, but a breakthrough came in May 2013, . when the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory’s Boeing X-51A . WaveRider flew for 240 seconds over the Pacific on scramjet power, . reaching Mach 5.1 and running until its fuel was exhausted. The next step is to build a high-speed cruise missile, able to strike distant targets . in minutes, not hours. Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works - builder of . the Mach 3.5 SR-71 Blackbird spyplane - has unveiled plans to develop a . successor, dubbed the SR-72 (pictured above). Designed for reconnaissance and strike . missions, the SR-72 would combine turbojet and ramjet/scramjet engines . to enable the aircraft to take off from a runway, accelerate to a Mach 6 . cruise, and then return to a conventional runway landing. If it can secure funding from the U.S. Defense . Department, Lockheed Martin believes a prototype could be flying as soon . as 2023 and the SR-72 could enter service by 2030, potentially paving . the way for commercial applications of scramjet technology.","Firms such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin have unveiled aircraft concepts .

"By . Matt Barlow for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . After the soaring temperatures of Cyprus some Tottenham fans are sure to return home with red faces but Erik Lamela was on hand to ensure that at least there was no embarrassment to accompany the sunburn. Spurs were within 16 minutes of being the first English team to lose to Cypriot opponents in competition and the locals inside the Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium were giddy at the prospect of making history in the first leg of this Europa League play-off. The game changed, however, within minutes of Lamela’s introduction, as he opened spaces and supplied the passes for Roberto Soldado and Harry Kane to score the goals to send Mauricio Pochettino’s team home with a 2-1 lead. For Soldado, his ferocious strike must have been like a shot of pain relief. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mauricio Pochettino: Every competition is important to Tottenham . Hard fought: Harry Kane is felled by a robust challenge as Tottenham were made to work very hard by a committed AEL but managed to come away with the victory . Dream start: The Cypriots got off to the perfect start, Adrian Sardinero putting them in front early on, leaving Spurs shell-shocked . AEL Limassol (4-4-1-1): Fegrouch 7; Soares Carlitos 6, Cadu 7, Sielis 6, Edmar 6; Sardinero 6.5 (Calo 80min), Guidilleye 7, Nikolaou 6, Diego Barcelos 6 (Eleftheriou 67, 5); Bebe 6; Gikiewicz 6 (Tagbajumi 73, 5). Subs not used: Pulpo, Espana, Tagbajumi, Stavrou, Miguel Carlitos, Nadeau. Booked: Cadu. Scorer: Sardinero 14. Tottenham (4-2-3-1): Lloris 6; Naughton 6, Dier 6, Vertonghen 6.5, Davies 5; Bentaleb 5, Paulinho 4.5 (Chadli 59, 6); Townsend 5 (Lamela 72, 7.5), Kane 7, Holtby 4.5 (Dembele 67, 6); Soldado 5. Subs not used: Friedel, Rose, Dawson, Sandro. Booked: Holtby, Soldado, Davies. Scorers: Soldado 74, Kane 80. Man of the match: Erik Lamela. Referee: Manuel de Sousa 6. Until then, it had been another miserable experience for him as he missed an early sitter and collected a booking for a desperate lunging foul committed after an inexcusably poor touch. For Kane, the winner was just reward for his bustling performance, when for long periods he seemed like the only player with the desire to haul Tottenham out of trouble after Adrian Sardinero had put AEL ahead in the first half. But much credit goes to Lamela, a 72nd-minute substitute, who is showing signs that under the guidance of fellow Argentine Pochettino, Spurs may begin see what all the fuss and money was about. ‘It is never easy in the first season for a player from another country,’ said Pochettino. ‘It’s true it was difficult for him. He was injured, too. He was very disappointed about last season but the past is the past. ‘We are confident that with time and hard work, like he has done in pre-season, he can go far. We need him to look forward, believe in his skill and work very hard.’ Until Lamela’s arrival, Spurs had been hugely underwhelming. They were sluggish and sloppy in the stifling heat and on a terrible pitch, which was slow, spongy and cut up quickly. AEL were having no such problems and were playing fluently by the time Sardinero put them ahead in the 14th minute. The goal was a simple affair, the result of an awful sequence from Spurs, when Jan Vertonghen and Paulinho were both careless in possession, deep in defence. Sardinero seized the ball, drove towards goal and beat Hugo Lloris as he careered out. Pochettino looked unimpressed and accused his team of being complacent and failing to heed his pre-match warnings. ‘We knew they had a good team but I think it’s true that we believed it would be an easy game,’ said the Spurs boss. ‘We struggled in the first half. We started well but then made some mistakes and they came into the game. ‘It was a very tough game in difficult conditions. We started to play in the second half. In general, I am happy and in the end it is an important result for us.’ Enduring the heat: Spurs fans watch on as their side struggles in the first half, but they will return to England happy after a second-half turnaround . Shut down: Soldado struggled in the first half as AEL denied him time on the ball, but the Spanish striker responded with a goal with 15 minutes to play . Advantage: Andros Townsend battles with Edmar Lacerda da Silva as Spurs battle to turn the tie around . Delight: Erik Lamela, who came on as a substitute moments before Spurs began their comeback, celebrates the first goal with scorer Soldado . Perhaps it would have all been a little easier had Soldado scored in the fifth minute, when Karim Fergrouch spilled a shot from Kane at his feet. Soldado could not adjust his feet in time and the ball squirted wide from his left boot. Most of Tottenham’s best moments in the first-half revolved around Kane who displayed energy and positive intent, even if his final delivery was inconsistent. Twice the young striker was denied from distance by AEL’s Moroccan goalkeeper. Pochettino’s three second-half substitutions lifted the team and his strikers combined well when Soldado nodded a cross from Nacer Chadli to Kane, who caught it crisply on the half-volley. Fegrouch beat the effort down into the ground only for it to spring up behind the keeper, hit the bar and fly out. Kane held his head, fearing it was one of those days, but AEL were wilting and Soldado soon levelled. Lamela slid a pass into his feet, although it was not an easy chance. But the £28million record signing gathered the ball from the £30m record signing and lashed it in from an angle. Six minutes later, Lamela came alive again, this time producing a smart reverse pass to release Kane, who took a touch, wriggled clear of a defender and drove the ball high into the top corner. Lamela almost added a wonderful third with an intricate dribble from the left and a low shot which flashed narrowly wide. It did not matter. Despite the scare, Spurs had seized control and will surely confirm their place in the group stages next week.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A sinister video has been released showing the first glimpse inside a torture chamber where two ex-Chicago police officers allegedly planned to mutilate the manhood of a wealthy businessman to get their hands on his properties. The FBI surveillance video shows Steven Mandell, 62, inside the room authorities claim he and co-conspirator, Gary Engel, purpose built to slice in half the penis of businessman Steve Campbell in a gruesome extortion plot before killing him and cutting up his body. The chamber seen in the tape, one of a number shown to jurors in Mandell's trial this week, is complete with heavy tables where the torture and dismemberment would be carried out, authorities say, and an industrial steel sink to clean up afterwards. Scroll down for video . Grim: The FBI surveillance video, pictured, shows Steven Mandell, 62, inside the room authorities claim he purpose built to slice in half the penis of businessman Steve Campbell in a  gruesome extortion plot . Chamber: The door of the Chicago building, pictured, that led to the chamber was misleadingly marked with the sign 'Christian Consulting' and Mandell jokingly referred to the chamber as 'Club Med' The door was misleadingly marked with the sign 'Christian Consulting' and Mandell jokingly referred to the chamber as 'Club Med,' according to NBC News. The footage was filmed by a wired-up real estate agent called George Michael, who is the state's star witness in the case. In the video, Michael asks, 'How much you want me to put into this place at the beginning?' Mandell responds: 'Uh, I don't, but I think, uh, I think Stanley discussed already, he just wanted maybe the partition and the bare, the bare minimum, the sink is I recall and uh, garage opener. You - do you recall that conversation?' Michael says he does remember then Mandell adds 'And tap into all the people's resources temporarily.' Prosecutors say the plan was to kidnap . Campbell and take him to the torture chamber where they had powers of . attorney and quit claim deed forms they intended to force Campbell to . sign. Jurors heard another . conversation where Mandell is talking about what he wanted to get . from Campbell, a real estate mogul with some 25 high-revenue unmortgaged . buildings. Gruesome plot: Steven Mandell, left, who is on trial, and Gary Engel, right, allegedly plotted to torture businessman Steve Campbell in October 2012. They allegedly planned to dismember him after the toture . The former cop says to Michael, 'I'll tell you what I'd like to keep as well, as far as cherry picking for the guy's portfolio.' According to the Chicago Tribune, Mandell laughed in other videos shown in the courtroom when he described how victims often come unglued before their deaths. He also mimed a blindfolded prisoner, then drew a hand across this throat to signify a killing. In one video played Wednesday Michael uses Mandell's nickname for Campbell, 'Soupy,' after the soup brand. 'How do you know Soupy will talk?' Michael asks. 'This guy will spill the beans,' Mandell replied. He then puts his hands over his eyes and lets out fake cry of terror, according to the Tribune. Mandell is charged in connection with two murder plots as he also allegedly plotted to kill an associate of a mob-connected strip club in order to take over the lucrative business. Dozens of audio and video recordings made by Michael, form the basis of the government's evidence against Mandell. A . court filing released early January ahead of the trial included a . grisly transcript of him allegedly chatting with his co-conspirator, Engel, in October 2012.

Both . men were cops who lost their jobs in the 1980s after they were accused . of a similar extortion plot. Days after their arrests in 2012, Engel was . found hanged by a bed sheet in his prison cell. In the recordings, they discussed how they'd tie up Campbell and Mandell told Engel he knew he'd play with the man's penis by sticking 'a little blade there', according to filings shared by the Chicago Sun Times. Engel said the man might come out 'with a split weeny'. 'It’s like slicing a banana split,' he told Mandell. 'You know what a banana split looks like?' Mandell made 'Ooh' sounds and said he could 'feel it' as Engel detailed the torture. A court filing was released last month ahead of Mandell's trial. It included a gruesome transcript in which he and his co-conspirator Gary Engel allegedly detail how they will mutilate the victim's genitals. Warning: Graphic content.

"By . Associated Press . University of Virginia student Elizabeth Daly (pictured last year), had a case of water in her car mistaken for alcohol by state agents in April 2013 . A college student in Virginia reached a $212,500 settlement on Wednesday following her arrest last year when state agents had mistaken a case of water for beer. Attorney General Mark R. Herring announced that Elizabeth Daly, now 21, had reached a settlement in state court. She had initially filed a $40 million federal lawsuit against agents with the state Alcoholic Beverage Control unit. Herring said the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing by any of the parties in the lawsuit. Daly had left a Charlottesville, Virginia, supermarket in April 2013 when her car was surrounded by state ABC agents, one of whom drew a firearm and another who had jumped onto the hood of her car. They had mistaken her carton of La Croix sparkling water for beer that her friend had purchased. The young women claimed to be at the grocery story shopping for a charity fundraiser the next day. 'My roommates and I were terrified,' Daly told The Hook. 'We called 911 as we had been taught to do if you were ever unsure of the validity of people saying they are law enforcement.' Daly said she became frantic when unmarked agents surrounded her vehicle, banging on the windows and demanding that she roll them down. One of her two friends in the car had allegedly said that the badges were fake and told her to 'go, go, go' according to the lawsuit cited in the AP report. Unsure whether they were in fact agents, she and her friend fled the scene in the car, grazing two of the agents in the process. The 911 operator was unable to confirm whether the agents were real but while they were near an intersection the operator told them that they were in fact agents, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The women had intended on driving to a local police station while the agents had chased them on foot, according to The Hook. Daly said the agents' credentials were not clearly visible and they did not did identify themselves in an attempt to stop her from leaving the scene. A young woman who was friends with Elizabeth Day had purchased the case of La Croix water that had been mistaken by authorities for beer (stock image) She was subsequently arrested at a red light at the nearby intersection. She faced two counts of assault and one count of eluding — both are Class 6 felonies and she would've faced a maximum of five years in prison and no more than a $2,500 fine but the . charges were later dropped and her record was expunged. Daly filed the suit in Richmond Circuit Court and is alleging malicious prosecution, failure to train ABC agents appropriately as well as six counts of assault and battery.","Elizabeth Daly, now 21, and her friend had their car swarmed by state agents after their case of water was mistaken for beer .

Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley has issued a damning assessment of football following the revelations by Sportsmail of Malky Mackay and Iain Moody's shocking text messages, claiming that the game is 'tainted with racism, sexism, homophobia and antisemitism'. Ouseley called on the Football Association to stop 'shirking' responsibility and punish anyone guilty of harbouring such attitudes, and even accused the governing body of knowing about racists at the very top of the game and yet still taking no action. Sportsmail excusively revealed on Thursday that Mackay and Moody have been reported to the FA and accused of being racist, sexist and homophobic in a series of texts dating back to their time together at Cardiff.

'Kick It Out is aware but not shocked to hear of reports revealing alleged racist, antisemitic, sexist and homophobic comments made by former Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay, and Iain Moody, the former Sporting Director at Crystal Palace,' said Lord Ouseley. 'These revelations are further confirmation of how football is tainted with racism, sexism, homophobia and antisemitism, and the culture which continues to exist throughout the game and in wider society as a whole. 'The reality is that these views are most dangerously held by those people in positions of power, and the football establishment knows and condones it.' After months of investigation, Sportsmail revealed the details of two letters sent to the FA outlining explicit and offensive texts. These messages came to light after a dawn raid on Moody’s south London home in March this year, as part of Cardiff’s £750,000 investigation into eight controversial transfers. Around 70,000 text messages and 100,000 emails were allegedly recovered, including the text and email exchanges that form the basis of letters sent to the FA. Exclusive: Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton's story in Thursday's Daily Mail . Revelation: Sportsmail broke the story of Mackay and Moody's text message . The letters to the FA make reference to the following alleged offensive communications between Moody, Mackay and others: . Front-runner: Mackay was expected to be given the vacant manager's role at Crystal Palace . Revealed: Moody's house was raided as part of an investigation into Cardiff's transfers while he was at the club . Lord Ouseley said that anyone who expressed such views should take responsibility for their actions, even if they were made in private and then became public. The chairman of the anti-racism campaign group also called on football's administrators and clubs stamp out racial prejudice and discrimination. 'This familiar scenario acts as a challenge to the leadership of football that cannot be shirked again,' he said. 'The governing bodies and the clubs must denounce such attitudes prevalent in the game, and take the appropriate action. 'If these types of exchanges made privately make it into the public eye, the individuals concerned must accept the full consequences of their actions. 'Kick It Out now awaits the outcome of The Football Association's investigation.' Racial slur: Mackay is alleged to have bad-mouthed incoming South Korean international Kim Bo-Kyung . Caught: Mackay is also said to have called a club official a 'gay snake' and sent a picture of 'Black Monopoly' Peculiar: Mackay dropped his suit for wrongful dismissal at Cardiff, strangely apologising to owner Vincent Tan . Mackay, the former Cardiff manager, and Moody, the club’s former head of recruitment, appeared to be on the verge of being reunited at Crystal Palace, with Mackay thought to be replacing Tony Pulis. But it is understood Mackay dropped out of the running after Palace learned of the evidence that has been passed to Wembley officials and on Thursday morning Moody resigned as Palace’s director of football following the revelations. 'What you see at face value is not always reflective of the attitudes which are actually held deep down,' added Lord Ouseley. 'It's easy to present yourself as being reasonable and fair, and to behave in ways that hide prejudice and bias. 'However, any in-depth forensic examination or analysis of hidden views would be likely to reveal otherwise. That is what makes it difficult to eliminate and eradicate such prejudices, bigotry and even hatred.' May 2010: Vincent Tan is the new owner of Cardiff City.

October 2013: Mackay’s head of recruitment, Iain Moody, with whom he had worked at Watford, is replaced by 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov (right), reportedly on work experience, although he is unable to take the job on visa grounds. December 16: Cardiff beat West Brom in the Premier League and Mackay suggests to the Press that he will need three players in the January transfer window. Lim releases a statement on behalf of Tan that criticises Mackay for his comments and asserts that he will not be given ‘a single penny’ for transfers. December 19: Mackay is emailed by Tan, informing him to either resign from his position or be sacked. December 22: Cardiff release a club statement that Mackay will remain as manager ‘for the foreseeable future’. December 26: Cardiff lose 3-0 at home to Southampton, as fans stage a protest against Tan. December 27: Mackay is eventually dismissed as Cardiff manager. The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC. In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete. The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise. Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC. Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter. Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others. Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter. VIDEO Solskjaer promises improvement .

"By . Robin Cottle for MailOnline . Blackpool 1-2 Blackburn . Rudy Gestede bagged a brace to hand Blackburn their first win of the season and keep Blackpool searching for theirs. Gestede netted either side of half-time while Tomasz Cywka's effort just before the hour was a mere consolation as Jose Riga's side's miserable start to the season continued. After opening the season with a 1-1 draw with Cardiff, Blackburn are now up and running in the Championship while Blackpool are still seeking to open their account after three defeats in all competitions. Heads: Rudy Gestede heads his second goal for Blackburn to pile on the misery for Blackpool .

Britt Assombalonga went some way to repaying his £5 million transfer fee with his first goals for Nottingham Forest as they twice came from behind to draw at Bolton. Joe Mason's header gave the Trotters the lead after just four minutes but Assombalonga's close-range finish cancelled out the advantage after 27. That sparked a flurry of goals as David Wheater when he slotted in before the former Peterborough striker coolly converted a penalty after he was brought down by Wheater. Off the mark: Britt Assombalonga gets his Nottingham Forest career up and running . Norwich 3-0 Watford . Joel Ekstrand was sent off after just two minutes as Norwich thrashed Watford to give Neil Adams his first win as Canaries boss.

Paul Taylor hit the bar for the hosts but the visitors wasted a succession of chances as they slipped to defeat. Super sub: Lewis Hall stretches to score a bizarre winner for Rotherham in their clash with Wolves . Reading 1-0 Ipswich . Jake Taylor's goal was enough for Reading to continue their unbeaten start to the season with victory over Ipswich. Taylor settled matters halfway through the first half, running onto a through ball and guiding the ball past visiting keeper Dean Gerken. Reading fluffed a host of chances but did enough for the three points. Winning goal: Jake Taylor watches on as his winner for Reading against Ipswich crosses the line . Charlton 2-1 Wigan . Franck Moussa came off the bench to a score a dramatic last gasp winner for Charlton against Wigan. The hosts took the lead after only eight minutes thanks to a superb strike by Jordan Cousins.

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @@CraigHope01 . Sir Bobby Robson was something to everyone; the grandfather of the game, a father figure to his players and the son of a proud North East region. His death was mourned but his life celebrated, every tear dried with a smile. Five years on, his legacy is tangible in the form of the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, the brilliant charity which has raised £7.3million for cancer research, treatment and care. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tributes to Sir Bobby Robson . Missed: It has been five years since the passing of Sir Bobby Robson . Gone, but never forgotten: Thursday marks the anniversary of Sir Bobby's passing at the age of 76 . Tribute: Ipswich Town's Portman Road stadium is adorned with the face of former manager Robson . Thursday marks the anniversary of his passing at the age of 76 and the Football Association will honour the former England manager - and 20-times capped wing-half - with a Sir Bobby Robson Day celebration. His popularity, however, is everlasting, the memories make sure of that. Italia 90, of course, came some years before his success at PSV Eindhoven, Sporting Lisbon, FC Porto, Barcelona and Newcastle United, but it is the image of Robson dancing on the touchline in the wake of David Platt’s winning goal against Belgium which remains his most overriding; bronzed skin, silver hair, gold standard. England’s joyous journey to the semi-final in Italy triggered the explosion of football’s popularity and its appeal to a new generation, not, as many would have you believe, the birth of the Premier League. Special: Robson cared, not only about his players, but every supporter who walked through the turnstile . Former Newcastle goalkeeper Steve Harper took to Twitter to pay tribute to his former boss, writing: '5yrs ago today we lost not only a great manager but a great man too. His tremendous legacy lives on through the fantastic @SBRFoundation' Prior to this summer’s World Cup, a television feature asked England’s players for their Three Lions hero – to a man they replied ‘Paul Gascoigne’, the star of 1990. Gascoigne, however, attributes everything to Robson. ‘He was like a second dad, a phenomenal human being,’ he once said. The affection was mutual. The Sir Bobby Robson Trophy Match at St James’ Park recreated the semi-final between England and West Germany and came just five days before Robson’s death. Frail and in a wheelchair, It was his final appearance in public. Until the end, however, his first thought was football and the players he had nurtured. On his way home from the game he asked, ‘How was Gascoigne? How did Gascoigne do?’. Honoured: The Sir Bobby Robson statue stands proudly outside Newcastle United's stadium . Robson cared. Another Gascoigne anecdote springs to mind. The night before that semi-final against the Germans, Robson’s star midfielder was missing. The manager tracked him down to a tennis court where he was taking on two American tourists. Rather than turn on Gascoigne, Robson asked the unsuspecting Americans why they were expending his player’s energy the night before the biggest game of his life. Gascoigne took advantage and headed straight for bed. Twenty-four hours later and Robson was again looking out for his prodigious talent following the booking which would rule him out of the final. Gary Lineker, famously, turned to Robson in the wake of Gascoigne’s tears. Lineker later said: ‘Out of everything in my career, the moment people ask me about most often was when Gazza got booked in that semi-final. ‘I could see his bottom lip was going. I think it says a lot about Bobby that it was him I turned to, to ask him to have a word. ‘Bobby knew instinctively when to scold him and when to put an arm round his shoulder. Gazza was an emotional guy and I know he exasperated Bobby on occasions but Bobby was brilliant at connecting with people.’ Remembering Robson - the miner’s son who was raised in a County Durham pit village - Sir Alex Ferguson said: ‘I was never too big or proud to ask him for advice, which he gave freely and unconditionally. Thoughts: The FA will honour the former England manager with a Sir Bobby Robson Day celebration . Giving: The Sir Bobby Robson Foundation has raised £7.3m for cancer research, treatment and care . ‘His character was hewn out of the coalface; developed by the County Durham mining background that he came from. ‘His parents instilled in him the discipline and standards which forged the character of a colossal human being.’ Lineker and Ferguson’s words have been, and will continue to be, echoed by the game’s greatest; from Alan Shearer to Ronaldo to Jose Mourinho. But it is Robson’s own words which best capture the emotion he still manages to evoke. In his book, My Kind of Toon, Robson wrote: ‘What is a club in any case? Joy: Paul Gascoigne pictured hugging England manager Bobby Robson after England's victory over Cameroon in the 1990 World Cup quater-final . Down: Gascoigne being consoled by Robson during England's 1990 World Cup semi-final with West Germany . ‘Not the buildings or the directors or the people who are paid to represent it. ‘It’s not the television contracts, get-out clauses, marketing departments or executive boxes. ‘It’s the noise, the passion, the feeling of belonging, the pride in your city. ‘It’s a small boy clambering up stadium steps for the very first time, gripping his father’s hand, gawping at that hallowed stretch of turf beneath him and, without being able to do a thing about it, falling in love.’ Robson was real. He cared, not only about his players, but every supporter who walked through the turnstile. He had been one of them as a boy at Newcastle’s St James’ Park and never lost sight of that. And that is why football will never lose sight of Robson – be it five years or 50, the grandfather of football will never get old. Sharing a joke: Robson flies back from the 1982 World Cup with then-manager Ron Greenwood . Jose Mourinho, who worked with Robson at Barcelona. ‘I will keep with me always the Bobby Robson of every day, a person who had extraordinary passion for life and for football, with an extraordinary enthusiasm. ‘Bobby Robson is one of those people who never die, not so much for what he did in his career, for one victory more or less, but for what he knew to give to those who had, like me, the good fortune to know him and walk by his side.’ Ronaldo, the Brazilian striker Robson described as one of his greatest players. ‘It makes me feel happy to hear how highly Sir Bobby talked about me because he’s a legend of football. ‘I’m proud to have worked with him. He was an awesome coach and an awesome person. He was like a father to me. ‘I have had a lot of managers in football but the difference between all of them and Sir Bobby was his humanity and the relationships he had with the players. He was always like a father to everyone.’ Legend: Ronaldo scoring for Brazil against Germany in the 2002 World Cup final in Japan . Steve Harper, his Newcastle goalkeeper with a more light-hearted recollection. ‘We were once training at Chester-le-Street and a guy was trying to land a helicopter on a newly seeded pitch. ‘Sir Bobby was underneath the blades, whirling round three feet over his head, shouting, “What you doing, what you doing?” pointing him back over the fence. He was nearly decapitated, protecting the grass as if he had paid for every seed.’ Alan Shearer, whose career he rejuvenated at Newcastle. ‘I was disillusioned (before Robson came in as manager), I wasn’t enjoying the game. I wasn’t scoring goals and wasn’t playing as I knew I could. ‘He knew me as a person, I’d spoken to him many times. He knew me as a player. He tried to buy me when he was manager at Barcelona, and he just came in and he got me playing in a different way. ‘He got me playing again with a smile on my face and enjoying football. If it wasn’t for him then certainly my Newcastle career would have ended early. ‘He was just a unique man. He was able to light the dressing room up. Because of his experience and because of the respect that everyone had for him when he spoke people listened. ‘And when he spoke and asked you to do well you wanted to do well for him because you liked him and you adored him and you felt for him and you felt the pressures and the pain he was going through. He had that aura about him. ‘He will never, ever be beaten.’","Thursday marks the anniversary of Sir Bobby Robson's passing at the age of 76 .

New boy: Ashley Cole is hardly the first Englishman in Italy - but how did the others get on? DAVID BECKHAM – AC MILAN (2009-10) Games: 29, Goals: 2 . Goldenballs had two loan spells in Milan towards the end of his career with the purpose of forcing his way into England’s World Cup squad. His first alongside Kaka, Ronaldinho and Andrea Pirlo was moderately successful and he returned the following year to the disapproval of fans at his parent club, Los Angeles Galaxy. Beckham played against Manchester United in the Champions League but then tore his left Achilles tendon against Chievo and was ruled out of the World Cup. VERDICT: FAIL .

Bothroyd was just 21 when he made the eye-catching move from Coventry City to Serie A. Though the football didn’t go great – he returned to England for a loan spell with Blackburn Rovers the year after he left – it was an  interesting life experience, befriending Colonel Gadaffi’s son Saadi who was also on Perugia’s books and collecting the shirts of illustrious opponents like Paolo Maldini and Andriy Shevchenko.

FRANZ CARR – REGGIANA (1996-98) Games: 6, Goals: 0 . Carr, the former speed king of Nottingham Forest, was pushing 30 when he went to Italy with lowly Reggiana and hardly made a big impression. He joined on a free transfer from Aston Villa but after just a handful of games was back in England to play on loan at Bolton Wanderers. VERDICT: FAIL . Transformation: Carr was the king of speed for Forest but was a flop at Reggiana . DANNY DICHIO – SAMPDORIA/LECCE (1997-98) Games: 12, Goals: 4 . Arguably Serie A’s unlikeliest English import, Sampdoria thought the 6ft4ins Dichio would give them something different up front but the former QPR striker’s technical limitations meant he didn’t last.  Sven Goran Eriksson signed Dichio but left soon after the striker arrived, so he went on loan to Lecce. VERDICT: FAIL . On the rocks: Danny Dichio had spells at Sampdoria and Lecce . Boy in blue: Dichio shows his colours in a Sampdoria photoshoot . PAUL GASCOIGNE – LAZIO (1992-95) Games: 43, Goals: 6 . To tell the whole story, you’d need to write a book. Gazza arrived in Rome a year after originally planned after rupturing his cruciate in the 1991 FA Cup final. His time in Italy was dogged with injury and weight problems but he scored a vital goal in the derby against Roma and is still idolised by Lazio fans. VERDICT: SUCCESS .

Manchester United’s self-styled Guv’nor showed he could walk the walk by impressing in Serie A under future England manager Roy Hodgson. Ince rose above the racist taunting that came from sections of Italian crowds and helped the club finish third in the league and reach the Uefa Cup final, which they lost to Schalke on penalties. Inter wanted him to stay longer but he returned home to sign for Liverpool. VERDICT: SUCCESS . Excitement: Ince poses with his adidas boots and an Inter Milan shirt as he signs in 1995 . Popular: Inter wanted to keep hold of Ince but he decided to return to England with Liverpool . DAVID PLATT – BARI, JUVENTUS, SAMPDORIA (1991-95) Games: 100, Goals: 31 . Probably England’s most successful player in Italy, Platt was signed by Bari from Aston Villa in the post-Italia 90 boom and did so well he ended up moving on to Juventus and then Sampdoria, who valued his goalscoring prowess from midfield. The highlight came at Sampdoria when he won the Italian Cup under Sven Goran Eriksson and developed a close friendship with team-mate Roberto Mancini.

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . Erik Lamela showed a glimpse of his undoubted quality by inspiring Tottenham to an unlikely comeback victory against AEL Limassol - a performance manager Mauricio Pochettino is confident the club-record signing will start producing with increasing regularity. Many had written off the 22-year-old after an injury-disrupted first season at Spurs in which he managed a measly three league starts. Quality: Erik Lamela skips away from Samba Dialo of Limassol after coming on and changing the game . Delight: Lamela celebrates the first goal with scorer Soldado after providing the assist . It was miserable start to life at White Hart Lane for the man billed as Gareth Bale's heir, but there are at last signs that the Argentinian could fulfil his potential with the north Londoners. After a decent display in the season-opening win at West Ham, Pochettino threw Lamela on after 72 minutes in Cyprus with his side losing to an early Adrian Sardinero goal in the first leg of their Europa League play-off. It proved an inspired alteration as within six minutes of his introduction not only had he provided the assist for Roberto Soldado's exquisite first-time leveller but he went on to set-up Harry Kane to secure an unlikely 2-1 win. 'It is never easy in the first season for a player from another country,' Pochettino said of his compatriot. 'It is true that it was difficult for him. Improvement: After a difficult first season Lamela is beginning to show flashes of his top-class talent . 'He was injured, too, and we are confident with him that with time and hard work, like he has done in pre-season, that he can go far. 'He was very disappointed about last season but the past is the past. 'We need him to look forward, believe in his skill and condition and work very, very hard. With confidence and time he will show his value. 'You always nominate players on the bench who can have an impact and all three subs had an impact on the game.' Taking the lead: English striker Kane celebrates putting his side ahead ten minutes from time . Lamela twice came close to capping his impressive display with a goal in the closing stages and is in line to start Sunday's match with QPR. It is a match in which Spurs will need a much improved performance to secure a positive result, with Pochettino suggesting complacency may have inadvertently slipped in at the Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium. 'I think it was a very tough game a difficult game, a hard game because he conditions were difficult and the weather was difficult,' he said, referring to the bobbly, cut-up pitch and temperatures in the 30s. Pointing the way: Spurs goalscorers Soldado and Kane celebrate the first of their two goals in Limassol . 'I'm happy with the performance. In the end 2-1 for us is an important result for us. 'It is true that in the first half we started to make mistakes, but in general, I am happy and looking forward to the next game, on Sunday. 'We created two or three chances in the first seven minutes. I think it's true that we believed that it would be an easy game, but we knew when we watched their game against Zenit, Limassol won the game won 1-0, that they have a very good team. 'In the second half we started the game, I think we restarted the game in the second half and I'm very satisfied after the game.'","Manager Mauricio Pochettino praises Argentine midfielder for impact .

"Meet the newly appointed foreign minister of the self-proclaimed Republic of Lugansk. Irina Filatova has been given the ministerial position in the region of eastern Ukraine where Russian nationalists are trying to forge states independent of Kiev. Her appointment follows on from Natalia Voronina, who was recently declared the new Minister of Culture of Donetsk People's Republic, another self-proclaimed state in eastern Ukraine. Scroll down for video . Irina Filatova is the newly appointed foreign minister of the self-proclaimed Republic of Lugansk . Irina Filatova has been given the ministerial position in the region of eastern Ukraine where Russian nationalists are trying to forge states independent of Kiev . However, while Ms Voronina has appeared to try to avoid the focus on her looks, Ms Filatova seems to be a little less concerned. Scarcely a day goes by without new pictures appearing of her from her life before her rise to the political heights of the new state. Ms Filatova's page on the Russian social network VKontakte, welcomes the users with a profile picture of the foreign minister in her swimsuit and with a beer in the right hand. Although the account may be fake, the pictures are not. A video of her shows her speaking in one of the 'press conferences' of the Lugansk People's Republic. She has spoken in the Rovenki City Hall. The appointment of Ms Filatova (pictured) as foreign minister of the self-proclaimed Republic of Lugansk follows on from Natalia Voronina, who was recently declared the new Minister of Culture of Donetsk People's Republic . Scarcely a day goes by without new pictures appearing of her from her life before her rise to the political heights of the new state . Irina Filatova has been appointed foreign minister of the self-proclaimed Republic of Lugansk - one of two regions in south eastern Ukraine that pro-Russian forces have declared 'independent'. The other self-declared 'nation' is the Donetsk People's Republic - which shares a border with Lugansk. Neither are recognised by any country. Throughout April, a number government buildings in Lugansk were occupied by pro-Kremlin forces demanding the region be allowed to join the Russian Federation. On April 27 protesters gathered outside the Regional Administration building to declare independence. They also unveiled plans for referendums to decide the region's future. Two days later, with the Ukrainian government not responding to the protesters demands, up to 3,000 insurgents stormed and occupied the administration building. Police officers guarding the building allegedly defected at this point and local flags were raised alongside those of the Russian Federation and of the Donetsk People's Republic. A referendum held on May 11 asked voters whether or not they 'supported declaration of state independence of the Lugansk People's Republic?'. Organisers claim 96.2 per voted in favour, although neither that figure nor claims of an 81 per cent turnout can be independently verified. Both women follow in the footsteps of Natalia Poklonskaya, the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Crimea. A video of Poklonskaya at a press conference on 11 March this year was uploaded to YouTube and went viral among Japanese and Chinese internet users. Within a month, the press conference was viewed over 1.7 million times. Many fans even created anime-style images of her which were uploaded to the internet.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss for MailOnline . A man battling cystic fibrosis has managed to control his illness by becoming a champion bodybuilder - despite risking his life every time he lifts weights. James Boudreau has a lung capacity of just 48 per cent and sleeps with an oxygen mask at night to prevent him from contracting life threatening lung infections. But the 29-year-old, who is nicknamed ‘The Miracle’, made it his life goal to become a champion bodybuilder after doctors told him he could be dead within two years if he didn’t have a lung transplant. James Boudreau has managed to become a champion bodybuilder despite battling the lung condition cystic fibrosis. This has reduced his lung capacity to just 48 per cent . Mr Boudreau, from Michigan, U.S., was . diagnosed with the debilitating lung disease - which makes . sufferers susceptible to life threatening viruses – when he was three. The genetic disorder also causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged with thick mucus. There is currently no cure. When he lost 72 per cent . of his lung capacity after a motorcycle accident at age 26, doctors . said he would be dead within two years if he didn’t have a lung . transplant. But Mr Boudreau, who comes from a family of body builders, was reluctant to have a transplant, as complications from the the same operation had killed his youngster sister when she was just a year old. Instead, . he swapped alcohol and junk food for weight lifting - and started building his strength – despite numerous doctors’ warnings . that strenuous exercise could kill him. Miraculously, . after changing his diet and taking protein supplements, his lung . capacity increased. With the support of his wife, . Amanda, 28, he began to gain weight and became strong enough to work . out seven times a week for 45 minutes – allowing him to increase his . lung capacity to a ‘safe’ 48 per cent. It was then he decided . take part in body building competitions.He said: 'I have been very active all my life but my mid-twenties was a real rough patch. 'After the accident I’d lost three quarters of my lung function, which was scary, because it came out of nowhere. 'I’d . tried to compete and failed, but I knew deep down in my soul that I . would live in a world of regret if I didn’t try one last time.

He credits bodybuilding with a marked improvement in his health . Mr Boudreau before he started bodybuilding. Having been told he needed a transplant to survive , he ditched fried food and alcohol and began taking vitamins and protein supplements . 'It was beyond a ‘bucket list’ type of goal – a must at any and all costs. 'My doctors weren’t happy about it but I told them how important it was to me and went for it.' He added: 'I want to show people who have this disease that anything is possible. 'I have no real cardio capacity other than walking or playing tennis in short bursts, and if I go all out, I just collapse. 'I sometimes need oxygen in the gym as well just to get through some sessions; I could collapse at any point when lifting weights.' Against all odds, James managed to scoop his first winner’s trophy in the junior lightweight division at the Flex Lewis Classic in Mursfreeburo, Tennessee – a feat previously deemed untenable. He now wants to compete in national body . building competitions and intends to apply for an International . Federation of BodyBuilding & Fitness (IFBB) ‘Pro card’–the . qualification required to become a professional body builder. Miraculously, after changing his diet and taking protein supplements, his lung capacity increased.

Mr Boudreau said: 'At first I was apprehensive, but with my wife 100 per cent behind me, I really genuinely feel I have a legitimate shot at becoming a pro' Mr Boudreau said: 'After the competition, I told my wife this would be the first and the last one. 'But after I won, she suggested a list of things I needed to do differently for the next competition. 'At first I was apprehensive, but with my wife 100 per cent behind me, I really genuinely feel I have a legitimate shot at becoming a pro. 'Cystic Fibrosis really doesn’t have an effect on my mental focus towards this goal, I like to think I can be the best, my biggest competition is my health.' He added that growing up with the condition - spending weeks in hospital and missing school - was tough. 'When you’re a kid, you want to do anything and everything your . friends are doing, so it was difficult for me being excluded from that . 'I would find myself in the hospital a lot while in school or over summer break, birthdays, Christmas and even New Year.'

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . He was forced to drink vinegar until he feared he would throw up blood, and made others swim in pools of vomit and excrement, but now, a reformed frat boy is exposing the sordid and sometimes deadly truths behind life in a college fraternity. Andrew Lohse, a 24-year-old Dartmouth College student, made himself a pariah in 2012 when he wrote a blog post exposing the hazing rituals at his Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and is now calling for an overhaul of the system. In a new book, 'Confessions of an Ivy League Frat Boy', he has opened up on the vile goings-on which are kept secret by fraternities and are so extreme that they have promising young students dead. Confessions of a frat boy: Andrew Lohse is revealing all about the sordid nature of hazing in a new book . The book details his experiences at the $60,000-a-year school, where he is still a student, but is on indefinite 'medical leave' because of what people might do to him for his blog exposé. He tells of how boys are forced to down beer until they throw up on each other's heads and swim in bodily fluids, while saying it is time these exclusive colleges moved on. 'Hazing was always part of the system for rank-and-file frat boys. It’s privilege and entitlement - this whole ""Lord of the Flies"" thing,' he told the New York Post. Reformed: Mr Lohse poses outside Sigma Alpha Epsilon's frat house, but has since exposed their activities . 'But they didn’t come in as bad kids - they weren’t just released from Rikers Island - they’re fundamentally brilliant, hardworking, talented kids.' Mr Lohse wants rid of the traditional Greek system, and believes women should be allowed in to remove gender segregation. 'The people who defend the status quo are on the wrong side of history,' he said. 'The only way is to abolish the structure as we know it, or modernise it to the 21st century [by making] it coed. Part of the problem with frats is that we’re not in a gender-segregated world any more. Tell-all book: Mr Lohse's new book tells of his experiences while part of a frat, while he also calls for reform . 'The school owes it to its students to abolish the system and re-purpose it. Imagine if you could put these gorgeous houses and real estate to a good use, instead of being the place where people vomit on each other.' Mr Lohse's 2012 blog told how he was 'forced to chug cups of vinegar until I was afraid that I would vomit blood,' and eat omelettes made from sick. He admits that he also went on to make others do similar, but has since realised he was wrong. His fate was far better than that of many others who have been involved with fraternities. In December last year, 19-year-old CUNY Baruch freshman Michael Deng died from brain trauma, and in February 2011 another 19-year-old - Cornell pre-med student George Desdunes - died from alcohol poisoning. As well as on their activities, Mr Lohse believe there should be far tougher controls on fraternity budgets, after revealing the crazy sums of money spent on booze at Sigma Alpha Epsilon. 'We would routinely drop $30,000 per quarter on alcohol alone,' he said, also remembering how they had paid $40,000 for  rapper Maino to play a three-song set at a party in 2009. 'The alumni’s love of the status quo and the college’s lack of moral courage make it a laughing stock,' he said, 'but they need to make the change. 'Yes, they’ll lose donations from these rich, white guys, but the stakeholders in 30 or 40 years will have a different point of view. 'Women won’t write a big fat check for this reckless behaviour to continue in these basements.' Dartmouth pursued charges against Mr Lohse for hazing after his 2012 blog post, though was cleared along with 26 other frat brothers. The incident also saw him lose most of his friends, and he was ostracised from Sigma Alpha Epsilon's community, as he he viewed to have brought shame on them. Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national leadership announced in March that it was eradicating pledging - the process of initiation into a fraternity, all together. Pledging is the process by which someone is initiated into a fraternity, and can take as long as a year and a half to complete. Those who are pledging a frat are known as 'pledges'. As well as becoming familiar with the fraternity, getting to know everyone and what is stands for, students are expected to prove themselves worthy of being made a 'brother'. This may be through things an innocent as cleaning the frat house and other such jobs, but can also be far more extreme activities like the one Andrew Lohse describes. This darker side of initiation is known as hazing, and can often involve alcohol, drugs and sex. Pledges can be deprived of sleep, beaten, branded, forced to drink huge amounts of alcohol and perform sexual acts. Every national fraternity and every U.S. university bans hazing, but that does not mean it does not still go on behind the scenes at frats all over the country.","Andrew Lohse, 24, has written tell-all book about fraternity experiences .

"By . Associated Press . Same-sex marriage is one step closer to being legal in North Carolina. And for one elderly couple, time is of the essence. Ellen 'Lennie' Gerber and Pearl Berlin of High Point are lead plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit against the Tar Heel State's gay-marriage ban. They've been together 48 years. At 89 and in fragile health, Berlin doesn't know how much longer she can wait. The retired educator has been hospitalized several times in the past two years, including for a fall in December that broke three ribs. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fighting for marriage rights: Lennie Gerber (left) and her spouse, Pearl Berlin, who have been together 48 years and legally married in Maine in 2013, have a federal challenge pending against North Carolina's constitutional amendment banning gay marriage . Commitment: Roman numerals indicate the date, June 2, 1966, that Gerber and Berlin consider the true anniversary of their relationship.  The couple are suing to have the state of North Carolina recognize their marriage . Fragile health: Pearl Berlin (right) has endured three hospital stays in two years and her spouse Lennie Gerber fears being denied spousal rights if something happens to her . On the summer night Gerber and Berlin committed to spending their lives together, the No. 1 song was 'When A Man Loves A Woman.' Lyndon B. Johnson was president. NASA had just landed the first unmanned probe on the moon. 'We're . still in love, after 48 years,' Gerber, better known as Lennie, said . recently. 'We still can't begin the day without a good cuddle.' June . 2, 1966, is engraved in Roman numerals on the identical gold bands the . women exchanged during a religious wedding at their Greensboro synagogue . last year on the anniversary of that long-ago night. They followed . three months later with a civil ceremony in Maine. But under North Carolina law, they might as well be strangers. That's . why Gerber and Berlin are the lead plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging . the state's voter-approved constitutional amendment banning legal . recognition of same-sex relationships. 'They can see that in us, that being . gay or lesbian is just the same as being straight,' Gerber said. 'You . just love somebody of your own sex. Otherwise, there's no difference. ... We want to be recognized for what we are — a married couple.' Last . month, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals — with jurisdiction over five . states, including North Carolina — struck down Virginia's same-sex . marriage ban. On Wednesday, the appellate panel refused to delay its . ruling, possibly clearing the way for gay marriages to begin next week . in the Old Dominion. North . Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper has said it would be 'futile' to . continue defending his state's similar law. Republican Governor Pat . McCrory and GOP legislative leaders urged Cooper, a Democrat, to . continue the fight, but gave no indication they will defend the ban . themselves. There are real-world worries that come with being gay and growing older. And time is not on the High Point couple's side. Berlin, . 89, fell down some stairs before Christmas, hitting her head, breaking . three ribs and enduring her third hospital stay in two years.

Married: Pictures from their wedding on June 2, 2013, in Greensboro, North Carolina, adorn the dining room wall in Pearl Berlin and Lennie Gerber's home, in High Point, North Carolina. The couple have a federal lawsuit pending to make gay marriage legal in their home state . Happy home: Pearl Berlin (right) and her spouse, Lennie Gerber, react to a visitor's story at their home in High Point . Gerber, a 78-year-old retired lawyer, . long ago drafted Berlin's health-care power of attorney. But a piece of . paper is no guarantee hospital staff would immediately afford her the . same spousal rights that would be automatic if she were married to a . man. 'It's very scary, that . something could happen to Pearl and I could be kept from her,' Gerber . said. 'They might not let me in the emergency room with her. They might . not let me help make decisions. ... It would be just horrendous if I . wasn't able to be there with her, holding her hand. I would die if I . couldn't do that.' Since . the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key section of the federal Defense . of Marriage Act last year, same-sex marriage proponents around the . country won nearly two dozen legal victories. Such marriages are now . allowed in 19 states and the District of Columbia. Legal . experts predict North Carolina's first same-sex marriage licenses could . be issued within months, depending on the legal process. But . Gerber and Berlin worry they might not have much time. Their lawyers . plan to file a brief asking a federal judge in Greensboro to grant . immediate recognition to same-sex marriages. 'Marriage . is a statement that you make in front of your family, your friends, . your community. It has a meaning that tells the world who you are. It's a . very fundamental part of someone's identity,' Gerber said. The walls of the home they built in . High Point are covered with art and photos from their adventures. They . visited all seven continents, even mingling with penguins on an . Antarctic ice shelf. Berlin is a perfectionist. Gerber admits she's something of a slob. They . met in 1964, when Gerber visited a friend in Detroit who invited Berlin . for brunch. Berlin taught at Wayne State University. Gerber was headed . to graduate school at the University of Southern California. It . wasn't love at first sight, but they had a lot in common. They both . taught physical education. They were both 'nice Jewish girls from . Brooklyn.' They'd never had much interest in boys.

Lifelong civil rights struggle: Lennie Gerber (right) hands a cup of coffee to her spouse, Pearl Berlin, in the kitchen of their High Point, N.C., home. Berlin is 89, and in fragile health, so their fight to overturn North Carolina's gay marriage ban has taken on an urgency . Stepping up: Their suit is one of four challenging the state's constitutional ban on gay marriage . 'I . had a crush on every female camp counselor I ever had. On every Girl . Scout leader. On a couple of my teachers,' Gerber said. 'I came home . from my first summer where I was at camp for a month, and I wrote, ""I . love Sandy,"" on every page of my diary.' Over . the next two years, with frequent calls and visits, their friendship . evolved into love. Gerber landed a job at Berlin's college. On the long drive moving Gerber to . Michigan, they stopped at a motel. Conversation turned to where Gerber . would live. That night, they decided to move in together. They . didn't tell their families they were a couple, but didn't hide it. They . lived in a one-bedroom apartment. Gerber's mother offered to buy a . second bed. They declined. She started buying Berlin pajamas. 'She . said, ""We will never condone this,""' Gerber recounted. 'But she got to . the point where she could laugh when I said, ""But Mother. You always . said all you cared about was that I marry a Jew, and I did.""' Berlin . had inadvertently outed herself years earlier, mistakenly sending her . mother a love letter she had written to a woman. Her mother called. 'And . she says, ""Pearl, I just want to tell you something. I just finished . reading today's mail, and I just read your letter to Marian. It was very . well written. I know you did not intend it for me. I want you to know . your father will never see it and never hear a word about it.""'

The couple were married in Maine last year, but they want their home state to legally recognize their love . The brides: A magazine cover depicting two women walking down the marriage aisle sits on the floor in Lennie Gerber and Pearl Berlin's home . Tireless work: The faces of Lennie Gerber, left, and Pearl Berlin stare out from an award on a shelf in their High Point . Eventually, even Berlin's father accepted their relationship, telling Gerber: 'Lennie. If you were a man, this would all be perfect,' Gerber recounted. Berlin moved to a college in Massachusetts, and Gerber got work there too. Then, in 1971, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro asked Berlin to run a new doctoral program. Gerber said school administrators made it clear they would never hire her. 'They said we were ""too open,""' Gerber said. 'You were supposed to pretend.' So Gerber went to law school and became a legal aid lawyer. Later, she helped gay and lesbian couples draft wills, powers of attorney and fill out tax returns. Still, no legal document can provide the same protections as a marriage certificate. Gerber recounts cases where relatives fought deceased people's gay partners over their estates, or excluded them from funerals. While that isn't a concern for Gerber, she worries Berlin's death certificate will list her marital status as single. 'I think anybody who had lost a spouse would be devastated if somebody said, ""Eh, this isn't your spouse.""' Berlin chuckles at talk of her demise. She already has picked the font for invitations to their golden anniversary party — on June 2, 2016.","Ellen 'Lennie' Gerber, 78, and Pearl Berlin, 89, are lead plaintiff in a federal suit against North Carolina's gay marriage ban .

"By . Frank Coletta for Daily Mail Australia . The Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory is a party divided again today with Member for Daly, Gary Higgins, refusing to attend all meetings, after an alleged homophobic slur against his son by Deputy Chief Minister Dave Tollner. Parliamentary colleagues have confirmed Mr Higgins' stance. He's informed party officials that he does not want to present at future meetings where Mr Tollner be in attendance. According to the NT News, the territory's Deputy Chief Minister is accused of calling Joshua Higgins a 'pillow biter' and 'shirt lifter'. Scroll down for video . NT Minister Dave Tollner has resigned as Deputy Chief and moved to the backbench after calling the son of a Country Liberal Party colleague a 'pillow biter' and a 'shirt lifter' Mr Higgins is a staff member working for Community Services Minister, Bess Price. It's been reported that the verbal attack occurred in the wake of a draft speech having been presented to cabinet ministers. The Chief Minister Adam Giles has bought into the latest scandal to beset his party, calling his deputy's comments 'inappropriate and not acceptable'. Reports in the NT News suggest Health Minister Robyn Lambley was also dragged into the controversy, admonishing Mr Tollner in front of cabinet colleagues and demanding he apologise. Member for Daly, Gary Higgins, has since announced he has accepted Mr Tollner's apology after originally threatening to boycott all Country Liberal Party meetings . 'Mr Tollner has apologised for his comments,' Mr Giles added. 'The Treasurer has told me that he did not intend to cause harm or offence with these comments and I know the individual concerned has accepted Mr Tollner’s apology.' Mr Giles believes the matter has been dealt with despite Mr Higgins' contention that he will not attend party room meetings should Dave Tollner be present. 'The person in question is a valued staff member and has met with me and expressed a desire to move on and that’s what we now intend to do,' Mr Giles said. Senior party officials disagree though, hinting at disciplinary action being the most appropriate action. One says that the CLP 'team is not cohesive'. The Chief Minister has not been immune from controversy either. Adam Giles led a party room challenge in March last year, toppling Terry Mills from the top job. This would ultimately sparked another internal revolt. Three of the party's indigenous members  quit the party, pushing Mr Giles perilously close to leading a minority government. Ironically, it's only the  victory (despite a massive swing against them) in Mr Mills' former seat of Blain which has the CLP clinging to a one-seat majority in parliament.

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A baby girl born with a 'back-to-front heart' endured two major operations to keep her alive, the first when she was just three hours old. Chloe Bennett was diagnosed with the congenital heart defect, while still in the womb. At her 20-week scan, her mother Stephanie Bennett was told her baby was suffering transposition of the great arteries (TGA). The potentially life-threatening illness means the major blood vessels in the heart are wired the wrong way, stopping the circulation of oxygen around the body. Baby Chloe Bennett was born with a congenital heart defect known as transposition of the great arteries. The condition means the major blood vessels are wired incorrectly, stopping the circulation of oxygen around the body . At just three hours old Chloe was taken into theatre for her first operation, where doctors inserted a balloon into her heart, helping her to breath. Her mother Stephanie Bennett, right, was told at her 20-week scan that her unborn daughter was suffering the heart defect, and would need major surgery . The 37-year-old was warned her unborn baby's only chance of survival would be surgery, and that she would struggle to breathe once out of the womb. Three hours after she was born, Chloe was taken into theatre for her first operation, designed to keep her breathing. Sixteen days later the newborn endured surgery once more, as surgeons worked to rewire her heart. Mrs Bennett and her husband Charlie, were finally allowed to take their new daughter home seven days after her major open heart surgery, despite warnings she could be in hospital for a month. Mrs Bennett, said: 'I can’t believe we are finally home after everything she has been through. 'At my 20-week scan I found out something was wrong with my baby’s heart. 'They said her heart was wired the wrong way and she wouldn’t be able to breathe on her own when she was born. 'I was so scared for her. In her first 16 days she had four general anesthetics and two major surgeries. 'But just one week after her open heart surgery, I was told I could take her home. 'It’s amazing when you see how well she is doing now, apart from the scar, you would never know what she has been through.' Three hours after Chloe was born on May 30, she underwent her first life-saving surgery, a balloon septostomy, under general anesthetic. Chloe's parents Stephanie and Charlie, then had to wait for 16 days until surgeons were ready to perform the second, life-saving operation on Chloe, rewiring her heart . Mrs Bennett, said: 'At my 20-week scan I found out something was wrong with my baby's heart. I was so scared for her. In her first 16 days she had four general anesthetics and two major surgeries' The mother-of-four, said: 'I only saw her for a number of seconds before she was whisked away from me. 'While I was having a blood transfusion, Chloe had her first surgery. Charlie didn’t know who to be with he was running between us both. 'They put a tube up through her belly button and inflated a balloon in her heart before removing it. 'This makes a hole through her heart which allowed her oxygen and blood to mix to keep her alive until her major surgery.' The family then faced a difficult 16 days waiting for Chloe to have her life-saving operation. Mrs Bennett, said: 'She had all sorts of tubes going into her body and down her throat. 'She was on a drip too to keep her blood and oxygen mixing to keep her alive. 'At one point I counted she had 45 holes in her body all at once. 'Because she was so small, her tiny veins collapsed a lot and so she had to have a cannula going into her head. 'She contracted necrotizing enterocolitis infection too so that put off her surgery date twice.' When Chloe was cleared of the potentially life-threatening infection, a third date was set but doctors warned her parents she might not make it. Mrs Bennett, said: 'Two days before it came Chloe looked terribly ill. 'Her oxygen levels had drastically dropped. I was so worried for her. Just seven days after her second operation, baby Chloe was allowed home to her parents and three older siblings, including sister Lola, pictured . Doctors had warned the family that Chloe could be in hospital for up to three weeks after her second operation . Chloe pictured with her parents Charlie and Stephanie, as well as her older brothers and sister. Mrs Bennett added: 'She is doing really well and her brothers and sister love having her around. She has got a massive scar... But apart from that, you would never be able to tell everything she has been through' 'The doctors knew they couldn’t leave her any longer for her surgery so the next day she had to have it. I was petrified.' On June 15, Chloe was put under general anesthetic to have her heart rewired. Her mother said: 'It was the longest day of my life. It was so scary waiting for her to come out of it. 'Her heart is so tiny it’s amazing how they can operate on something so intricate and no bigger than a small strawberry. 'But the surgeons were amazing and they managed to replug her. And my little Chloe was so tough she pulled through. 'After 48 hours I got to hold her in my arms again.'

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Drug: Abiraterone (pictured), a pill that gives at least four months of extra life, is given to patients after chemo, when they are running out of options . The NHS rationing body is refusing to give men with prostate cancer a drug that can delay the need for chemotherapy. Abiraterone, a pill that gives at least four months of extra life, is given to patients after chemo, when they are running out of options. But thousands could benefit from taking it earlier, since it has fewer side effects than chemotherapy and improves quality of life. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) today says in final draft guidance that it will not approve such use on the NHS. Campaigners and doctors have condemned the decision, saying it is another example of Nice limiting treatment options for cancer sufferers. They fear that innovative treatments in the pipeline don’t stand a chance of getting approved under the rationing system, and that promised changes next year will actually worsen the situation. They also claim it is ‘illogical’ to prevent men being treated with abiraterone earlier in the disease, when the NHS is already picking up the bill for treatment after chemotherapy. Owen Sharp, Chief Executive of Prostate Cancer UK said ‘It’s a fiasco. This decision is a kick in the teeth for men with advanced prostate cancer. ‘For many this presented a vital opportunity for extra time with loved ones and a chance to delay chemotherapy and the debilitating side effects which come with it.’ Hugh Gunn, treasurer of the prostate cancer charity Tackle, added: ‘We’re so distraught that NICE keep limiting these life saving drugs for men with no other life lines, with seemingly no evidence to support their decisions.’ Doctors at the Institute of Cancer . Research in London, where the drug was discovered, said the decision . showed the system operated by Nice was not fit for purpose – the same . charge made last week when the breast cancer drug Kadcyla was blocked. Angry: Thousands of patients could benefit from taking the drug earlier, but the Nice says it will not approve such use on the NHS. Owen Sharp (pictured), of Prostate Cancer UK, described it as a 'kick in the teeth' In the case of abiraterone, Nice said the drug was too costly to use at an earlier stage in the disease. When the drug is used after chemotherapy, different rules apply that take into account the end-of-life plight of patients which make the drug cost-effective. Although the drug is sold to the NHS at the same price at whatever stage in the disease it is used, the cost effectiveness formula becomes more expensive before chemotherapy. The official price of a month’s treatment is £3,000 but the NHS pays less through a discount scheme from the manufacturer. Professor Paul Workman, Interim Chief . Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: . ‘Abiraterone, which was discovered at The Institute of Cancer Research, . is now used as standard after chemotherapy, where it was found to be . cost-effective under NICE’s own end-of-life criteria. Deadly disease: Abiraterone, also known as Zytiga, was used pre-chemotherapy by 3,000 men last year through the Cancer Drugs Fund, which picks up the bill for patients in England. Above, prostate cancer cells . ‘It is plainly illogical that NICE did not have the flexibility to assess use of abiraterone before chemotherapy under the same end-of-life criteria, simply because men were here surviving for longer than the two-year cut-off. ‘It is an unintended, and quite bizarre, consequence of the current rules for appraisals that patients have to wait until their life expectancy drops before they can access beneficial drugs on the NHS. ‘Now men will have to wait until they are in the final stage of their lives before they can access this treatment, and men who are too frail to receive chemotherapy face not being able to receive abiraterone at all.’ Abiraterone, also known as Zytiga, was used pre-chemotherapy by 3,000 men last year through the Cancer Drugs Fund, which picks up the bill for patients in England when a drug is awaiting approval from Nice. Some Britons have survived on it for almost five years. Blocked: Doctors at the Institute of Cancer Research said Nice's decision showed its system was not fit for purpose - the same charge made last week when the breast cancer drug Kadcyla was blocked . Mr Sharp added: ‘The current system is flawed. It is not fit for purpose and it is the very people it is supposed to serve who are bearing the brunt. ‘This decision is unjust and it needs to be overturned so that men in desperate need can receive the most effective drugs, wherever they live.’ Professor Workman said there was mounting concern that British patients would increasingly lose out. ‘We believe that the current Nice system for drug appraisals takes too little account of how innovative a treatment is, and we worry that the new rules under consideration could make this situation even worse,' he said. ‘It is likely that many modern targeted therapies will be more effective in patients when used earlier in treatment or in combinations, but it will be impossible to provide treatment in these ways if innovative drugs first fail to clear the hurdle of Nice approval.’ Dr Peter Barnes, Medical Director at Janssen said the company would appeal. ‘We are very disappointed with this decision which, if it stands, will leave thousands of men in England in the advanced stages of prostate cancer with no option but to accept chemotherapy - which they may not necessarily need or want yet - before being eligible to receive abiraterone routinely on the NHS,' he said. ‘These men will eventually be able to receive abiraterone on the NHS after chemotherapy anyway, but will be denied the option of taking it earlier on in their illness.’ In 2012, Nice attempted to ban the use of abiraterone altogether but was forced into a U-turn after a public outcry and a rare intervention from the Department of Health (DH). In June, former Health Minister Paul Burstow urged the DH to intervene to call off the restriction on pre-chemotherapy use of abiraterone. Sir Andrew Dillon, NICE chief executive, said ‘We know how important it is for patients to have the option to delay chemotherapy and its associated side effects, so we are disappointed not to be able to recommend abiraterone for use in this way. ‘However, it was clear that the drug is not cost effective at its current price.’","Abiraterone gives at least four months' extra life to prostate cancer patients .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Imagine being able to run an optical fibre to any point on Earth or in space. That is what one physicist says could be possible in the future, opening up the possibility of communicating with colonies of people on Mars via a kind of broadband, for example. Professor Howard Milchberg believes that an ‘air waveguide’ could enhance light signals collected from distant sources, making long-distance communication possible as never before. Physicists at the University of Maryland have found a way to make air behave like an optical fibre, which could guide light beams over long distances without losing power . The professor of physics at the University of Maryland believes waveguides could have many applications, including long-range laser communications, detecting pollution in the atmosphere, making high-resolution topographic maps and even laser weapons. As light loses intensity with distance, the range over which such tasks can be done is limited. Even lasers, which produce highly directed beams, lose focus due to their natural spreading or due to interactions with gases in the air. This is an illustration of an air waveguide. The filaments leave 'holes' in the air (red rods) that reflect light. Light (arrows) passing between these holes stays focused and intense . The air waveguides were made using very short, powerful laser pulses. A . laser pulse transforms into a narrow beam called a filament, which . happens because the laser light increases the refractive index of the . air in the centre of the beam, as if the pulse is carrying its own lens . with it. The refractive index, also called index of refraction, measures of the bending of a ray of light when passing from one medium into another. Professor . Milchberg has previously shown that the filaments heat up the air as . they pass through, causing it to expand and leave a ‘hole’ of . low-density air in their wake. This . hole has a lower refractive index than the air around it and while the . filament itself lasts for just one trillionth of a second, it takes a . billion times longer for the hole to appear. The . physicists have previously showed that four filaments were fired in a . square arrangement, produce holes forming the low-density wall needed . for a waveguide. The . ‘pipe’ produced by the filaments lasted a few milliseconds, a million . times longer than the laser pulse. Because . the waveguides are relatively long-lived, he believes a single guide . could be used to send out a laser can collect a signal. But fibre optic cables trap light beams and guides them like a pipe, preventing loss of intensity or focus. They typically consist of a transparent glass core surrounded by a cladding material with a lower index of refraction. When light tries to leave the core, it gets reflected back inward. Solid optical fibers can only handle so much power, and they need physical support that may not be available where the cables need to go, such as the upper atmosphere. To solve these problems, Professor Milchberg and his team have found a way to make air behave like an optical fibre, which could guide beams of light over long distances without loss of power, according to the study in the journal Optica. The air waveguides consist of a ‘wall’ of low-density air surrounding a core of higher density air. Just like a conventional optical fibre, the wall has a lower refractive index than the core, guiding light along a ‘pipe’. The physicists broke down the air with a laser to create a spark and used the air waveguide to conduct light from the spark to a detector a three feet (1 metre) away. The signal was strong enough so that they could analyse the chemical composition of the air that produced the spark. In fact, the signal was one-and-a-half times stronger than a signal obtained without the waveguide. While this may not seem a lot, over distances that are 100 times longer - where an unguided signal would be severely weakened - the signal enhancement could be much greater, the scientists explained. The air waveguides were made using very short, powerful laser pulses. Just like a conventional optical fibre (pictured), the wall has a lower refractive index than the core, guiding light along a 'pipe' A laser pulse transforms into a narrow beam called a filament, which happens because the laser light increases the refractive index of the air in the centre of the beam, as if the pulse is carrying its own lens with it. Professor Milchberg has previously shown that the filaments heat up the air as they pass through, causing it to expand and leave a ‘hole’ of low-density air in their wake. This hole has a lower refractive index than the air around it and while the filament itself lasts for just one trillionth of a second, it takes a billion times longer for the hole to appear. The physicists have previously showed that four filaments were fired in a square arrangement, produce holes forming the low-density wall needed for a waveguide. The ‘pipe’ produced by the filaments lasted a few milliseconds, a million times longer than the laser pulse, which for many laser applications is ‘infinity,’ Professor Milchberg said. Because the waveguides are relatively long-lived, he believes a single guide could be used to send out a laser can collect a signal. ‘It’s like you could just take a physical optical fibre and unreel it at the speed of light, put it next to this thing that you want to measure remotely, and then have the signal come all the way back to where you are,’ he said. The next step is for the scientists to show that the waveguides can be used over distances of at least 164ft (50 metres). They could then be honed to conduct chemical analyses of places like the upper atmosphere or nuclear reactors, where it’s difficult to get instruments close to what’s being studied. The waveguides could also be used for Lidar, a variation on radar that uses laser light instead of radio waves to make high-resolution topographic maps.","Air waveguide could be used to improve light signals from distant sources .

"By . Becky Barrow For The Daily Mail . Tax officials must not be given powers to seize money directly from people’s bank accounts because they are not competent enough, a banking chief has warned. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers’ Association, also said he had ‘real concerns’ that the proposals could breach people’s human rights. His hard-hitting letter to Chancellor George Osborne is the latest twist in the growing controversy about a plan that has triggered ferocious opposition from accountants and MPs. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers’ Association (pictured), said he had ‘real concerns’ that the proposals to allow money to be seized from people's bank accounts could breach customers' human rights . Under the new powers, HM Revenue & Customs will be able to take cash directly from a current account, joint account or ISA to settle an unpaid tax bill. Around 17,000 people a year will have money seized under the proposed new powers, known as the ‘direct recovery of debts’. Each will typically owe £5,800. But Mr Browne wrote: ‘For these proposals to work as intended, HMRC’s tax assessments, systems and processes would have to be sufficiently robust that the likelihood of HMRC mistakes in the application of these powers could be reduced to a negligible risk. ‘HMRC’s performance cannot yet be considered as sufficiently competent to wield an unchecked power this strong.’ Mr Browne raised fears that the proposals might contravene the Human Rights Act. ‘We have specific concerns about how the proposals would interplay with the Act,’ he wrote. ‘We are not persuaded that the rights of those affected by the proposals, including the vulnerable, family members and those erroneously affected, are sufficiently protected.’ HMRC says it will only target those who owe £1,000 or more and have been contacted at least four times. It argues that it is wrong to let a tiny minority, who can afford to pay their taxes but refuse to do so, to get away with it. But the BBA fears HMRC will target not just ruthless tax dodgers, but also ‘a significant number of unintentionally non-compliant, vulnerable taxpayers’, such as the elderly. Under the new powers, HM Revenue & Customs will be able to take cash directly from a current account, joint account or ISA to settle an unpaid tax bill and it is thought around 17,000 a year would be affected (file picture) Mr Browne wrote: ‘We believe that the proposals could have a negative impact on the frail and vulnerable and could undermine public faith in the tax system.’ He also raised concerns that HMRC would be able to remove the money without the need to apply to a court. In the Lords recently, Lib Dem peer Lord Smith of Clifton, who is 77, revealed his experience with HMRC, which he described as an ‘out-of-control computer juggernaut.’ He had promptly paid £992.62 he owed, but was pursued for the money for the next four weeks, threatened with debt collectors and faced charges for late payment. Lord Smith said: ‘HMRC has no control over its computer system, which dementedly sends out demands for weeks on end. ‘This was to someone classified in the official jargon as a “frail, old pensioner” who had always been assiduous in paying his tax well before the deadline.’ Earlier this month it emerged that the independent tax watchdog had found in favour of nine in ten people whose case it investigated. Over the 12 months to March 31, the Tax Adjudicator resolved 2,311 complaints. Of these, 2,073 went in favour, or partly in favour, of the taxpayer. Nearly £4million of tax was written off. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘There is no question of those who genuinely cannot pay being affected – the safety of vulnerable customers is a priority and the Government is proposing robust safeguards.’ The money will only be taken if they would have at least £5,000 left after it has been removed.","Under new powers HM Revenue & Customs could take cash from accounts .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A teenage girl who smothered her mother to death with a pillow after years of 'mental cruelty' in their troubled relationship has been jailed for nearly five years. Rebecca Durkin, 19, from Southport, Merseyside, admitted strangling her 55-year-old mother Clancy but denied murder saying she had not intended to kill her. However, sentencing her to four years and eight months in prison for manslaughter, Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, told the student that he was sure she had intended to kill her and had smothered not strangled her. Rebecca Durkin, 19, (left) from Southport, Merseyside, has been jailed for four years and eight months after admitting to strangling her 55-year-old mother Clancy (right).She denied murder but admitted manslaughter . 'I am sure on this occasion you lost your self-control. You smothered your mother with a pillow as you had tried to a greater or lesser extent on two previous occasions in weeks earlier,' the judge said. 'On this occasion you smothered her with a pillow possibly in the course of a further argument superimposed upon others which had happened earlier that evening. 'You resisted her efforts to struggle during which I am satisfied she scratched your face and you smothered her for about 15 seconds.' Liverpool Crown Court heard that it 'had been a disaster waiting to happen.' The judge told Durkin, who showed no emotion during the hearing, that he did not accept her suggestion that she had not intended to kill her mother, who was suffering with alcoholism. 'I am sure you did. You had had enough and that is something you will have to live with for the rest of your life,' the judge said. Referring to their relationship he said: 'Although in many respects and in difficult circumstances your mother did her best for you and you for her, it was clear that over a period of years you suffered long term mental cruelty at her hands.' 'Her addiction to alcohol for many years which she managed to keep from her close family clouded her judgement and it was drink which affected her ability to behave as a normal mother should. Durkin, 19, (pictured) admitted killing her mother following an argument on the evening of January 6 . 'Sadly a picture has been painted of a young girl who was belittled and under-valued and had to withstand the sort of pressure which no teenager should have to.' He said it was not a constant picture as they had enjoyed some good times. 'Your mother was, I think, like the girl with a curl in the nursery rhyme who when she was good was very good and when she was bad she was horrid,' he said. 'I am satisfied your relationship with your mother had been continuing in a gradual spiral for many years. He pointed out that after the killing at their home in Southport on the evening of January 6, Durkin returned to a friend's home and the next day feigned shock and surprise at the death of her mother, who worked as a domestic at Southport Hospital. She tried to claim, at a friend's suggestion, that an intruder may have been to blame after a post-mortem examination found that Clancy had died from asphyxiation. A jury cleared the student and part-time care worker of murder at a trial in June after agreeing she had lost control after being provoked. During the trial, the jury heard how Durkin, who has an IQ of 80, had been unable to cope with the pressure of wanting to leave home and her mother's wish for her to stay. She agreed to stay with her mother, whose number she had stored under 'The Evil B***h', if she promised to stop drinking. However, Clancy started drinking again and on night of the incident, they rowed before Durkin returned home to get some belongings so she could stay overnight with a friend. They had a further argument and shortly afterwards Durkin rang a friend and said: 'I've killed my mum, I swear down I've done it.' A jury cleared Durkin (above) of murder in June but the teenager, who showed no emotion at the  hearing, admitted manslaughter and was sentenced to four years and eight months in prison at Liverpool Crown Court . The next morning she returned home and rang 999 saying she had found her mother 'all blue' on the floor. Simon Medland, QC, defending, said, 'Here was a disaster waiting to happen. There was a most appalling set of circumstances building up between the deceased and the defendant. 'It is a tragedy worth remarking upon that the deceased's life although tried to make it good and in many ways was a good mother as best she could it fell very far short of the mark on occasion.' Durkin admitted manslaughter in April and was jailed for four years and eight months by Judge Goldstone today who told her: 'Your family life may have been a very sad and very difficult one but that family is now totally destroyed and split by what you did.'","Rebecca Durkin admitted strangling her mother Clancy at Merseyside home .

"By . Chris Pleasance . The key to any good flashmob is the element of surprise, but for these tricksters the surprise was on them when police turned up and began arresting everyone. Prank group Improv Everywhere ran into trouble while pretending to be shop mannequins in a Manhattan branch of Gap after an employee called police. Around 40 people went into the shop dressed in Gap clothing with white bodysuits underneath, before zipping the suits up at a predetermined time and posing next to genuine mannequins. Scroll down for video . Members of a flashmob posing as shop mannequins in a Gap store in Manhattan were handcuffed by police after a member of staff called the authorities . The stunt involved around 40 people who were all asked to go to the store wearing gap clothes and bodysuits . The participants all went into the store separately before zipping the suits up at a predetermined time . While members of the public and some Gap staff were filmed finding the stunt amusing, it wasn't long before one shop assistant called 911. Concerned by a spate of burglaries disguised as flashmobs at other nearby stores, officers promptly cuffed around 20 of the human mannequins before laying them out on the floor. 'We were very surprised at the response,' Improv Everywhere founder Charlie Todd told Mashable. 'It was distressing to see these people who were just helping me out down on the floor in handcuffs.' However, when cops realised people were just part of an innocent stunt, they decided to let them go. The store manager said he considered banning the participants for life, but had decided against it. They then posed next to genuine mannequins dotted around the store (the fake mannequin is on the right) Initially members of the public and staff were filmed laughing at the trick (fake mannequin is on the far right) At a glance the intruders are almost indistinguishable from the real thing (fakes are left, in glasses, and right) By strange coincidence, it turned out that one policeman recognised some of the group's organisers, because he had taken part in one of their flashmobs last summer. On that occasion 7,000 people dressed up like tourists and went to New York's South Street Seaport as part of an MP3 experiment. They were asked to download a track on to their MP3 player, then press play at a predetermined time and follow the instructions they were given. Improv Everywhere has carried out roughly 20 pranks in stores including Staples, Macy's and Starbucks, all of which passed off without much of a fuss. While some people remained oblivious to what was going on, it wasn't long before one staff member called police . By coincidence it turned out that there had been a spate of robberies nearby disguised as flashmobs, so when cops arrived they placed around 20 of the mannequins in handcuffs and laid them on the floor . However, after establishing it was just a harmless prank, officers let the participants go. By coincidence, it turned out that one policeman had actually taken part in another of the group's flashmobs last summer . The last time police were called in was during a prank at Best Buy eight years ago when participants dressed up like employees and stood around the store helping members of the public out. While nobody was handcuffed on that occasion, they were all forced to leave the store after staff became concerned.","Prank group Improv Everywhere targetted Manhattan Gap in latest stunt .

The medicines watchdog launched an investigation last night after The Mail on Sunday discovered three websites, including eBay, selling drugs such as anti-depressants and Roaccutane, an acne drug. Roaccutane has been linked with several suicides. It can only be prescribed by consultant dermatologists and dispensed by registered pharmacists. A Mail on Sunday investigation revealed that British websites, including eBay were selling drugs linked to suicide such as acne medicine Roaccutane (pictured) and anti-depressants . We found businesses advertising a wide range of drugs, without being legally registered to sell prescription medicines online, and passed their details to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). One website, Urbanpharma, lists a Manchester contact address and says it delivers medicines in 48 hours to UK addresses. The business is not registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC), a requirement to sell prescription medication. Another website, Aurapharm, was selling prescription-only drugs such as Roaccutane, again despite not being registered with the GPhC. Medical student Jon Medland committed suicide in 2004. His family said his death was linked to the drug Roaccutane. His father Jonathan Medland described the Mail on Sunday's revelations as 'terrifying' Jonathan Medland, 57, from Barnstaple, lost his 22-year-old son Jon, who committed suicide three weeks after starting a course of Roaccutane – obtained via a registered pharmacy – in 2004.

Although priceless, the crown jewels at the Tower of London have only once attracted the attention of thieves. In 1671, one Colonel Blood gained entry to the Tower, dressed in the robes of a priest. He overpowered the guards with his three accomplices, and ran off with the crown, orb and sceptre in his hands. The plan fell was thwarted at the getaway and he only made it to the East Gate of the Tower. Surprisingly Blood was pardoned by Charles II. Guards spotted the thief, but could only radio for assistance, as strict rules meant they could not give chase as they were unable to leave their posts. But their pleas for back-up were ignored and the raider managed to get away, forcing the management to spend thousands urgently changing the locks. It was claimed that the keys, which were stolen on Guy Fawkes night, could also unlock conference rooms and the restaurant. As a result of the embarrassing security blunder the locks had to be changed, at an estimated cost of thousands of pounds.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A young boy whose parents were told he may never walk or talk after brain surgery has defied the odds to become a dance champion and actor. Ben Wilby underwent a nine-hour operation because the plates in his skull had not fused correctly after birth. The youngster was diagnosed with Craniosynostosis when he was two years old, and doctors warned his parents he may not survive the procedure to relieve pressure on his brain. But a decade later and the now 12-year-old has recovered to star in films alongside Martin Freeman, and has also won an international dance competition. Ben Wilby, 12, has defied the odds, to recover after doctors warned his parents their son was unlikely to walk or talk following an operation to relieve pressure on his brain when he was two years old . Craniosynostosis is a condition where one or more of the sutures in an infant skull prematurely fuses and turns into bone. Following birth, a baby's brain grows incredibly rapidly - doubling in size in nine months and tripling in size by 36 months. To accommodate the growth, the skull also expands and t can do this because is it’s made up of several bones that are held together by 'sutures' - like fibrous hinges. Craniosynostosis is when the sutures close or fuse too soon. This can result in an abnormal head shape or facial features if the brain manages to find space to grow. It can also result in increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to blindness, sleeping and eating impairments, as well as problems with mental development. The condition occurs in one in 2,000 births. Source: Craniosynostosis.net . The young actor from Cannock in Staffordshire, underwent the complex operation at Birmingham Children’s Hospital when he was two years old. To mark the anniversary of the procedure, Ben will meet the surgeon who saved his life as well as visiting patients and their parents at the hospital to show them it is possible to achieve anything. His parents were told their son may not be able to walk after brain surgery, but Ben defied the odds and joined a dance school to develop his balance and improve the strength in his legs. He went on to win a number of trophies, including the title of European Freestyle Champion. Determined to live life in the limelight, . Ben then beat 500 other young hopefuls to win the role of Bob in the . hit film, Nativity, having turned up to the auditions wearing an . audacious outfit of neon green shorts, legwarmers and a t-shirt . with the slogan 'Born To Dance' on it. Ben underwent a nine-hour operation when he was two-years-old because the plates in his skull had not fused correctly after birth. His parents were warned that he may never be able to walk or talk. Here, he is pictured here after the procedure at Birmingham Children's Hospital . Ben, pictured with his mother Jill, has won a number of trophies, including the title of European Freestyle Champion . In the film, the boy can be seen showing of his moves, including a bit of break dancing. His mother Jill Wilby, said: ‘It has been an incredible ten years since Ben’s lifesaving operation. Doctors warned us that if Ben survived the operation he might never walk or even talk. ‘It seems just like yesterday to me. I remember Ben going into surgery clutching his favourite car. It was the most horrendous nine hours of my life.

"By . Emma Innes . The perfect age for a woman to start a diet is 32 – Kate Middleton’s age - according to new research. Women of that age - including singer Beyoncé - find it easiest to lose weight and stick to a diet plan. For men the best age to diet is 31 – the same age as Prince William. The best age for a woman to diet is 32 - Kate Middleton's age - the best for a man is 31 - Prince William's age . Both sexes said their early 30s was the optimum time for weight loss because turning 30 was a watershed moment in their lives and they wanted to stay fit and healthy as they leave their 20s. People are less likely to stick to diets in their mid-30s and 40s because they are not so bothered about their appearance as ageing takes its toll and they embrace middle age, according to 54 per cent of dieters. Almost six out of ten slimmers - 59 per cent - said that diets are more likely to go awry in the 20s because people are more likely to be single and to party more. The findings come from a survey of 1,000 male and female slimmers by the diet company Forza Supplements. The overwhelming majority of those polled - 82 per cent - said that 30 was a 'watershed' age for both sexes and they were more likely to stick to diets afterwards. More than a third of female respondents - 37 per cent - found the ages of 30 to 35 the best to slim. Women are more likely to stick to diets in their early 30s because turning 30 is seen as a watershed moment and they want to feel fit and healthy as they leave their 20s. Beyonce is the optimum age - 32 . Amongst this group 32 was the ideal age for women. Another factor making it the optimum for women to slim is the likelihood that they had become mothers. The average age of women giving birth in the UK is now a few weeks short of 30 - while first time mothers are older than ever at 28. Losing baby weight is a powerful incentive for women to slim with 56 per cent saying they had found it easier to lose weight after childbirth than before. Marriage was also a factor in helping women to lose weight. Four out ten female respondents - 42 per cent - said they found it easier to lose weight after marrying because they are less likely to drink and eat to excess. The average age for a new bride in the UK is 30. For men, 36 per cent said the ages of 30 to 35 were the most effective years to diet - with 31 the optimum age. Men's ideal age was a year less than women's because turning 30 was seen as a bigger watershed for them. Forza managing director Lee Smith said: ‘There is no doubt that turning 30 is a big moment for both sexes. ‘The ageing process starts to catch up with us all and both sexes are desperate to turn back the clock. ‘They are both in the right frame of mind to diet - and that's why they are both better able to lose weight around that age. ‘This is certainly true of the typical Forza dieter who is a young mum in her early 30s keen to lose a bit of weight after starting a family.’","The best age for men to start a diet at is 31 - Prince William's age .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A jealous boyfriend who stabbed his partner 83 times with four different knives after wrongly accusing her of having an affair has been jailed for life. Cornelius Brown, 23, tortured and killed 30-year-old Jade Riley-Ward in the kitchen of her house in Somercotes, Derbyshire, in September last year. Brown then called his mother and asked her to come to the house where, still covered in his girlfriend's blood, he begged her to kill him because he 'wasn't man enough to do it.' Cornelius Brown, 23, (left) has been sentenced to life in prison after stabbing his girlfriend Jade Riley-Ward 83 times with four different knives after she told him she 'wanted space' Nottingham Crown Court heard that Jade and Brown had known each other since childhood, as Jade had been his babysitter, and they started a relationship in January 2012. But Brown's 'jealous streak' soon became apparent and nine days before her death, Jade sent Brown a text message saying she 'wanted space'. In a jealous rage, Brown became convinced that Jade was having an affair behind his back. On September 22 last year Brown visited Jade's house with mutual friend Wayne Roberts who left before Brown began his attack. Sentencing Brown to life with 20 years before being considered for parole, Judge Jonathan Teare said: 'Your attack on Jade Riley-Ward was deliberate, vicious and prolonged. 'It would not be wrong to describe it as torture. You used up to four knives to inflict 52 individual cuts on her head, face, torso and back. 'She tried to defend herself to the point that there were another 31 defence wounds to her hands and arms. She tried to stop you and not one of those knife wounds killed her outright. She essentially bled to death at your hands.' Prosecutor Richard Thatcher explained that after the killing Brown had walked around the house, leaving bloody footprints on the carpet while smoking three cigarettes. He added: 'At 3.39pm the defendant made a call to his mother. The defendant had spent a little time walking around the property. 'The defendant's mother arrived at the house by taxi and emerged from it a short time later screaming. It was a tragic 30 minutes that ended with the horrific death of Miss Riley-Ward.' Brown was sentenced to life in jail after pleading guilty to the 'vicious and prolonged' attack . The court heard that during the attack a neighbour had heard a cutlery drawer rattling and the sound of Jade screaming, while a 16-year-old boy walking past had heard Brown shout 'don't make me do it'. Jade also tried to call Mr Roberts but he said the line was cut off and when he phoned her back, four calls went to voicemail. In Brown's defence, Patrick Thompson said: 'Nothing I can say can minimise the suffering and impact on Jade Riley-Ward's family and friends, who have lost a much-loved woman. 'The real mitigation is his guilty plea. He has never denied responsibility for the killing. 'This was an act carried out in the heat of the moment, there is no evidence it was pre-meditated and clearly he was emotionally immature. 'He lost his temper and committed the most dreadful, dreadful act. He bitterly regrets what took place, he did not try to cover his tracks and blame someone else.' Speaking outside court, Jade's mother, Maria, paid tribute to her daughter as a lively, vibrant and life-loving woman with many friends. She added: 'Since her death my life has been full of dark days that only the mother who has lost her only child can have. 'Nothing can bring my daughter back. Her life ended at the hands of someone who is evil and barbaric.","Cornelius Brown, 23, has been sentenced to life in prison for murder .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Standing for three hours a day, five days a week, is the equivalent of running ten marathons a year, a doctor has claimed . If you find it tricky to find the time – or the motivation – to go to the gym, here’s some good news. Simply standing up for three hours a day is as good for you as running ten marathons a year, an expert has claimed. Dr Mike Loosemore, Lead Consultant in Exercise Medicine at the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, said that official guidelines on exercise are impractical and can seem an impossible task for many people. But, he insisted, even small amounts of exercise can have health benefits. The Government advises we spend half an hour a day, five days a week doing moderate exercise. But Dr Loosemore said barely 7 per cent of men and 4 per cent of women meet that advice. More than a quarter of adults fail to exercise for just half an hour a week, making Britain one of the least active countries in the world. Speaking on BBC 4’s Today programme, he said: ‘The message I want to try to get out there is that small amounts of physical activity, although not reaching the government guidelines, are still doing you a lot of good – even just standing up is good for you. ‘I’m standing up now, I’m using all the small muscles in my legs and the rest of me, I’m keeping myself upright. 'If I stood up like this and worked standing up, which I do, three hours a day, five days a week, that would be the equivalent of running ten marathons a year.’ Dr Loosemore, who was also Lead Sport Medic for the GB boxing team at the London 2012 Olympics, added that people would be ‘entirely wrong’ to think that small changes, such as standing up more, are pointless. ‘It’s going to improve their health, it’s going to reduce their risk of heart disease, diabetes, it’s going to reduce their risk of cancer, it’s going to reduce their cholesterol and it’s going to make them thinner,’ he said. ‘If you keep doing small gains, they’ll improve your health.  It’s easy to do and you make it part of your lifestyle. It’s not about tracksuits and gyms, it’s just about adding a little bit of activity.’ A spokesman for the Department of Health . said: ‘We recognise that everyone has to start somewhere, and even . making small changes to daily routines will have long term benefits for . health and fitness. Other small ways of making a big difference include getting out of the lift a floor early to take the stairs, or parking 50 yards from the supermarket door . ‘The physical activity guidelines are designed to be a manageable way in which people can start to make these changes.' Other small ways of making a big difference include parking 50 yards from the supermarket door, rather than right next to it, and getting out of the lift a floor early to take the stairs. Dr Loosemore, who was chief medical officer for the England Commonwealth Games team in 2010, said: ‘I say to patients, when you get on the escalator don’t just stand on the escalator and let it take you up to the next floor, actually walk up one step. Just one step because although it seems like a tiny amount of physical activity, all that builds up.’","Dr Mike Loosemore says even small amounts of activity are beneficial .

"By . Quentin Letts . Rachel Reeves – what about her? Would she be better as Labour leader than Ed Miliband? Come on, team. We need positive thinking here. She has an economics background, was a chess champion as a child, and worked for the Bank of England before politics. That hairdo is slinky enough for a Silvikrin advert. And she is artful. Rachel Reeves: She has an economics background, was a chess champion as a child, and worked for the Bank of England before politics . She attended Ed M’s stinker of a speech last week, sat in the front row and managed not to chew her fist. She can say ‘Ed Miliband would make a great Prime Minister’ without promptly howling into a bucket (the reaction of other shadow Cabinet members). Yet she has also conceded  that Labour has ‘lost its raison d’etre’. There is a glint of ambition in this lady. Weak points: inexperience (b. Feb 1979) and no discernible sense of humour. She was once an ally of Ed Balls but has shimmied away from old Stinkbomb. The voice is not good. It sounds like a blocked peashooter – on radio you might mistake her for Harold Steptoe, played by the late Harry H Corbett. But engineers may be working on that larynx. The tone has risen slightly. It is almost high enough now for her to join the tenor line. Miss Reeves – whose younger sister Ellie is on Labour’s National Executive Committee and is more convincing as an orator – was up in the Commons yesterday. Ms Reeves conceded that Labour has lost its raison d'etre under Ed Miliband . The occasion was questions on Work and Pensions, which she shadows. Labour’s tactic for the next ten months will reportedly be to ‘toxify’ Government policies. We certainly saw that yesterday. They moaned about every policy from work capability assessments to personal independence payments to job figures (What? Employment is at a record high!). Labour MPs from Rosie ‘Tommy’ Cooper (West Lancs) to Ann ‘Smiler’  McKechin (Glasgow N) to Stephen ‘All Tories Are Moolti-Millionaires’ Hepburn (Jarrow) bewailed, deplored, lamented, deprecated the state of the nation. Not all these jeremiads were entirely genuine. One of the Welsh lot, Nick Someone, spoke of a ‘fiasco’ in this or that sub-pod of the welfare system – it was not handing out as much of our money to the poor as Nick Someone wanted. Mumbling Mike Penning, a minister, said it was absurd to call something  a ‘fiasco’ when a recent in-depth report had not found anything as bad as that. Nick Someone, hearing the minister’s response, laughed in a  way that seemed to say ‘fair point, guv, but I was just saying what the Labour Whips told me to say’. It’s all a game, innit? Mary Glindon (Lab, N Tyneside) produced a hand-held silk fan which she waved under her chin to keep cool during all this human misery. Shades of the bullfight senora. On the Labour front bench . Miss Reeves clenched her hands, examined her purple nail varnish and shook her glistening mane. Once or twice there came a froggy squawk – she was heckling ministers – but on the whole she was a picture of poise. Houston, we could work on this one. Maybe. She has more potential than dim-lit Sadiq Khan. Ballsy and  his eye-popping missus are fading. Apprentice hotel clerk Dougie  Alexander is a non-starter, ditto Arriet Arman. Miss Reeves lacks the snorting unpredictability of Caroline Flint but that may not be a disadvantage. She does not have Chuka’s eyelashes but she may be more substantial. The only problem? There is no intellectual foundation to her case. That is why she is struggling against Iain Duncan Smith. IDS has a few holes in his record but he has bravely taken on the welfare monolith (and the BBC). Miss Reeves might well rise further in her party but what Labour really needs is philosophical change. Philip Davies (Con, Shipley) said that it is now the Tories, with their welfare reforms, who have become ‘the party of labour while the party opposite has become the party of layabouts’. Only when the Left realises that egalitarianism itself is shot, kaput, finito, will it stand a chance of long-term recovery.","Ms Reeves worked for the Bank of England before going into politics .

"By . Martin Keown . Follow @@martinkeown5 . After the trophy had been presented and the players had finished spraying Arsene Wenger with champagne, I went down on to the Wembley pitch to say my congratulations. The last time Arsenal won a trophy — in 2005 — I hadn’t even been that bothered about going to the game and I certainly didn’t feel emotional. After all, Arsenal were used to winning trophies all the time. On Saturday, I did feel emotional and I wouldn’t have missed being there for the world. I was with Mo Farah, who is a huge Arsenal fan, and we spotted Wenger so went over to say hello. He looked a bit dishevelled as he’d just been given the bumps by his players and had to change out of his suit and into a tracksuit. I said to him that he looked like he’d just run a marathon. Marathon: Martin Keown watched the cup final with huge Arsenal fan Mo Farah . Emotional: Arsenal ended nine years without a trophy by beating Hull at Wembley . He wore a huge grin. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him happier. I think he was just delighted to be answering questions about winning a trophy — he probably wondered if it would ever happen again. At 2-0, I was worried for him, concerned that his reputation wouldn’t recover from losing such a game. Instead, the team found a way to win and now Wenger is a winner again. That’s what trophies do.  People were doubting whether he still had it in him but here was proof that he did. I also spoke to Aaron Ramsey, who has without doubt become Arsenal’s No 1 player, the first name on the team-sheet. Last season he was trying too hard at times but the improvement has been vast. He refused to accept that Arsenal would lose and kept taking the game to Hull,  making runs in behind them again and again. The winning goal was down to his persistence and was a fantastic finish. First step: But the Gunners must continue to win . Delighted: Arsene Wenger answered a lot of critics with the FA Cup win . I told him that the game will forever be remembered as the ‘Ramsey Final’ and that he’s gone down in history. He’s scored 16 goals this season and, amazingly, came back from injury playing at the same high standard as earlier in the season. Yet he could have been in goal facing penalties in a shootout too if Lukasz Fabianski had made contact with Sone Aluko, 40 yards out, in those crazy closing moments. Thomas Vermaelen is worthy of a mention too. He was once again left out of the team but you wouldn’t have known it from his celebrations. He showed true dignity and class as club captain — there was not a hint of bitterness in his behaviour. The players will be desperate to win more trophies now. I didn’t win my first until 1998 — I was injured for the 1994 Cup-winners’ Cup final — and the waiting weighs heavily. But then you just become hungry for a repeat and try even harder. No 1: Aaron Ramsey has grown to become Arsenal's most important player . Agonising: Sone Aluko saw a late, late chance cleared off the line by Kieran Gibbs . To do that, Arsenal will have to add to their squad. Yes, they are a maturing group of players but fans spend their hard-earned cash each week on tickets and merchandise and they want to see it invested in the transfer market. Signing Mesut Ozil in some way reunited the fans and the club, and they will expect the same again. Football is not just about being competitive on the pitch, but being competitive off it. Bacary Sagna looks likely to leave and Vermaelen and Johan Djourou could follow. Wenger must decide whether to make Carl Jenkinson his right back or buy a replacement. That could mean buying three defenders when they would surely rather spend money improving things at the other end. Dignified: Club captain Thomas Vermaelen acted in a brilliant manner despite being left out . Potential: Mesut Ozil needs to play with a striker who has the pace and willingness to latch onto his passes . Olivier Giroud has done very well, netting 22 times, but his place needs to be under more pressure. Arsenal need a world-class centre forward who can offer something different from Giroud —  someone with real pace who can run in behind defences.  Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka used to fill that role. With the right target, Ozil and Santi Cazorla will cause havoc, picking him out time after time. At the moment, especially with Theo Walcott injured, Arsenal are too reliant on Ramsey’s runs from deep. Added to that should be a tough-tackling midfielder. Yes, half the Premier League is looking for the next Yaya Toure or Nemanja Matic, but Arsenal need to find him.","After winning the FA Cup against Hull City, Arsenal must carry on their success .
I was watching with Olympic champion Mo Farah .
Aaron Ramsey has grown hugely this season, he is Arsenal's No 1 player .
As good as Olivier Giroud has been, Arsenal need a striker in the Thierry Henry or Nicolas Anelka mould - that will make Mesut Ozil better ."
"By . Sean Poulter . and Peter Campbell . Cooking on gas: Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw is to receive £4.1million pay for his efforts last year while customers' bills are set to soar . The owners of British Gas last night threatened to increase energy bills by £130 – on the same  day that they approved  multi-million pound pay packages for the firm’s bosses. The energy giant’s parent company, Centrica, yesterday said rising costs could push the average household ‘dual-fuel tariff’ to a record high of around £1,400. Despite a shareholders’ revolt at yesterday’s annual meeting, the company still agreed to hand out lavish packages to its executive board. Some 16 per cent of shareholders . refused to back the deal, which will see chief executive Sam Laidlaw . receive pay and perks of £4.1million for last year’s work. He . was also awarded shares worth an additional £5.05million which he could . be entitled to receive in 2014 depending on the company’s performance. His perks include a £684 discount on his annual energy bill – more than half the amount paid by the average family. The company last year put up rates by 18 per cent for gas and 16 per cent for electricity for its 15million customers. Yesterday’s annual meeting was the latest where shareholders hit back against vast executive packages, in what has been dubbed the ‘Shareholder Spring’. Earlier this week insurance giant Aviva saw its chief executive Andrew Moss resign after shareholders opposed his £5.2million pay. Double standards: The energy giant's parent company, Centrica, yesterday . said rising costs could push the average household 'dual-fuel tariff' to a record high of around £1,400 . His exit followed those of Trinity Mirror Group’s Sly  Bailey and drugs giant AstraZeneca’s David Brennan. Last night, Centrica said wholesale energy prices for next winter have increased and the trend for tariffs ‘remains upwards.’ It said green taxes will also put up prices. The firm said: ‘UK wholesale gas costs are around 15 per cent higher for next winter than last, and non-commodity costs ... are expected to add a further £50 to the cost of supplying the average household this year.’ It means that the group will no longer be able to keep rates at current levels – currently £1,232 for the average dual-fuel bill. Analysts suggest this would drive up the annual bill by £130 to £1,362. Last night consumer groups questioned whether the increases were fair. Audrey Gallacher of Consumer Focus, the official customer body, said: ‘Consumers will need clear evidence that price rises are warranted if they are to stomach further increases to their bills. ‘The perception is that suppliers are quick to pass on high price rises and slow to pass on small price cuts. 'Much greater transparency on costs, pricing and profits is needed for customers to know whether they’re getting a fair deal. 'Wholesale prices go up and down but customers need to know this is accurately reflected in their bill.’ Departing: Earlier this week Aviva's chief executive Andrew Moss resigned after shareholders refused his £5.2m pay demands. His exit comes in the wake of a string of others including Mirror Group's Sly Bailey . Tom Lyon, of energy price comparison site uSwitch.com, described the threat of higher prices as ‘deeply worrying’. He said: ‘Any further increases will see even more people  seriously struggling to afford their bills. We would urge all suppliers to hold fire for as long as possible and to ensure  that if they do move it is only in response to a sustained upward trend. ‘It’s also important that they recognise the impact it will have on their customers.’ Yesterday shareholders called on Mr Laidlaw and British Gas managing director Phil Bentley, to quit. One investor said they should use their perks to pay the company’s £2.5million fine, imposed on British Gas by energy regulator Ofgem for failing customers. Profits at Centrica last year were just under £2.5billion, with City analysts predicting the figure will surge 20 per cent this year to reach £2.9billion. Pointing the finger: Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint said those struggling to make ends meet will be astonished that Centrica is now threatening another round of price hikes . British Gas profits are expected to rise from £522million in 2011 to £592million this year. Mark Todd, of Energy helpline.com, said: ‘Wholesale gas increases of 15 per cent typically translate to bill increases of 10 per cent, so we could expect the average bill to rise by around £80 a year. ‘On top of this, British Gas has also said that other costs have increased by £50 per household. In total, this would translate to a £130 a year or 19 per cent gas price rise. ‘This would take the average   gas and electricity bill to over £1,400 a year, the highest in history and beating the previous record years of 2011 and 2008.’ Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint said: ‘Hard-pressed families and pensioners struggling to make ends meet thanks to the recession made in Downing Street will be astonished that Centrica, who made billions in profits and paid out millions in bonuses last year, are now threatening another round of price hikes.’","Household bills could reach record highs .

"By . John Edwards . Follow @@JEAlty . Concern: David Baddiel . David Baddiel has dismissed claims that  ethnic origin entitles Tottenham fans to call themselves the ‘Yid Army’ by insisting only ‘three or four per cent’ are Jewish. Tottenham rallied around their supporters, after Society of Black Lawyers chairman Peter Herbert urged police to prosecute those who hold aloft banners bearing the name ‘Yid Army’ and chant it during games. Club bosses welcomed the police response that there was ‘no deliberate intent to cause offence’ and that it  was more a form of self-parody by a  predominantly Jewish support. But Baddiel, the comedian and writer who is himself Jewish and a fervent Chelsea fan, is adamant such a line of defence was factually incorrect and that anti-Semitic abuse should be stamped out wherever it occurs. ‘The idea that Spurs fans are reclaiming the Y-word and are entitled to because so many of them are Jewish is simply not true,’ he said. ‘There are only 250,000 Jews in Britain as a whole and I’d say about three or four per cent of Tottenham’s crowd is Jewish. ‘That means well over 90 per cent of those chanting “Yid Army” are not  actually Jewish and that is just one of several reasons why it cannot be right. If, for instance, there was a team in  Brixton called Brixton United, and they had a mainly white support who adopted the N-word as their badge of honour and went round chanting “N***** Army”, they would be closed down tomorrow. ‘At Tottenham, the club’s “Jewishness” is just an historical association with the area. It’s doubtful that there are more than five per cent actual Jews in the ground at home games (only 0.4 per cent of the UK is Jewish). So the argument “but it’s just like Snoop Doggy Dogg using the N-word” does not apply to most Spurs fans.’ Spurs fans chant 'Yid Army' at Europa League clash - click here to read Sami Mokbel's report . Although some Tottenham fans may view ‘Yid Army’ as nothing more than a label identifying which team they follow,  Baddiel has experience of why the term has more sinister undertones. ‘I was at a Chelsea match with my brother Ivor two years ago,’ he said. ‘It wasn’t even Tottenham we were . playing. It was Villa, but news that  Tottenham were losing at Hull . appeared on the big screen and this bloke sitting behind us started . saying “F*** the yids! F*** the yids!” followed by “F*** the Jews!”.

"Martin Atkinson has been appointed to referee City's game vs West Ham on Sunday . Atkinson's experience will help him cope with any pressures, just like I did when Manchester United beat Tottenham 2-1 to win the first part of their historic treble . 51-year-old Phil Dowd will referee Liverpool's clash against Newcastle in what may be his final game in the Premier League . By . Graham Poll . Follow @@MAIL_GPoll . Martin Atkinson has been entrusted with the game which is expected to see Manchester City confirmed as Premier League champions on Sunday. The 43-year-old is often seen as the PGMO’s safe pair of hands as he has the experience to cope with any pressures that might come to bear should the game not go as expected. I remember refereeing the last game of the 1998/99 season at Old Trafford where Manchester United knew if they beat Tottenham they would be crowned champions and secure the first trophy of their historic treble. Man in the middle: Martin Atkinson will referee Manchester City's home clash against West Ham on Sunday . Tottenham went a goal up and news came through that title rivals Arsenal were winning at Highbury. It takes strength of mind and character to block out those outside influences and focus on the job in hand. Atkinson will have to do that at the Etihad and not dwell on any negative thoughts regarding ""costing"" City the title. He refereed their recent 2-2 draw with Sunderland and 6-3 home win over Arsenal - either result would suit them this time. Been there, done that: Graham Poll refereed Manchester United's 2-1 final day win against Tottenham in 1999 . End of an era? Phil Dowd (right) could referee his final game when Liverpool host Newcastle on Sunday . Liverpool also have the vastly experienced Phil Dowd on their final game which could be his last top flight appointment. There is no retirement age any more but as Dowd turns 52 next season he must realise that his active refereeing must come to an end at some point. Dowd had refereed only one Premier League game at Anfield this season, a 4-0 win against Tottenham.","Martin Atkinson has been appointed to referee City's game vs West Ham on Sunday .

"By . James  Nye . Paul Walker's family and friends gathered to say a final farewell to the tragic actor at an intimate Santa Barbara beach memorial on Sunday - one day after he was laid to rest at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. The star's 15-year-old daughter Meadow joined his 25-year-old brother Cody, his father and his mother as they laughed and remembered the actor the best way they could - by playing football and enjoying the warm weather. Also beachside to reminisce about the life of the 40-year-old with his loved ones was Tyrese Gibson, who co-starred with Walker in the Fast & Furious franchise. Fitting tribute: The Walker Family including daughter Meadow and 'Fast & Furious' co-star Tyrese Gibson (with football)  spend the day at the beach in Santa Barbara, California . The choice of Santa Barbara also seems to have been the appropriate place for the memorial - Walker had long made the beautiful coastal stretch his home. Indeed, after the fatal crash on November 30, the image of Tyrese Gibson breaking down in tears at the site of the accident has become one of the most iconic images of the actor's sad death. After his service on Saturday, Tyrese posted a message onto Instagram which paid tribute to his friend. 'Today . In a room full of your loved ones I wish today was your wedding . instead,' Tyrese heartbreakingly posted along with a black and white . photograph of Walker. He . went on...' I guess you can’t get all you ask for in life…. But our . hearts are FULL from all the moments we DID have, 13 years of laughter . and grace, humility and love….. Never did I take my access for . granted….' Food and smiles: Tyrese returns with the football at the Santa Barbara beach while close friends and family of Paul Walker - including his 25-year-old brother Cody (in the red T-shirt) look on . Support: Meadow Rain, 15, walks with friends along the Santa Barbara beach on Sunday - the day after her father was laid to rest in a low-key ceremony that was attended by friends and family as her grandfather (Paul Walker Snr.) walks with a friend towards the beach . And in a tragic interview with US Weekly in mid-November, Walker revealed how happy he was that his 15-year-old daughter was moving from Hawaii to California to live with him. 'I'm glad I had her at 25, because at 40 and 15, we're matching up sweet. It's just working,' Paul told the magazine. 'It's perfect,' he added. Paul said he was looking forward to spending more quality time with Meadow and improving their communication. Paul's close friends Ronn Shikari and Vince Krause, who both live in Hawaii, earlier this month said Paul was planning on giving up acting to spend more time with Meadow. Difficult: The day was held near to where Paul Walker lived in Santa Barbara and his daughter Medaow Rain was accompanied by her friends as she walked along the beach . Contemplation: Meadow Rain looks to the ground as her friends walk alongside her at the memorial service for her father Paul Walker who died in a car crash on November 30 . The teenager spent the first 14 years . of her life in Hawaii with her mother Rebecca Soteros, before moving in . with Paul recently in Santa Barbara. 'He . was a family man and I know it hurt him to be spending so much time . away from Meadow on location; he loved being with his daughter, she was . his world,' Ronn said. 'That's . why he wanted to retire from acting and talked to his family about it, . as he’d achieved everything he wanted to achieve.' Overlooking: Other friends and family of Paul Walker not playing football or dipping the feet into the Pacific Ocean watch from a Santa Barbara beach house .

Brother: Paul Walker's brother Cody stares out towards the sea as he attends his late siblings memorial service on the beachfront at Santa Barbara . On Saturday, the Fast & Furious franchise star, whose remains were cremated on Thursday was laid to rest at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, following a brief non-denominational ceremony attended by family and close friends. According to the website, the ceremony took place at the Court Of Liberty, one of the cemetery's historical sites. An American flag was allegedly folded in a triangle and displayed during the ceremony, and then given to the star's family. More than three dozen people dressed in black and grey arrived at the landmark cemetery, where Walker's framed portrait has been set on an easel. A pair of guards in white short-sleeve shirts, black berets and white cloves stood watch during the ceremony. The family reportedly were hoping to keep the event private and is said to have asked those in attendance to arrive and leave together so they can be accompanied by a security escort. Walker, best known for his roles in the ""Fast & Furious"" action movies, died on November 30 in a car crash in Southern California - which has led to an outpouring of grief nationwide . Emotional: The Walker Family including daughter Meadow and 'Fast & Furious' co-star Tyrese Gibson spend the day at the beach in Santa Barbara, California . Ahead of the somber ceremony, Paul Walker's father, Walker Sr., was photographed driving his white KIA SUV towards the site of the burial. A slew of celebrities are buried at the iconic Hollywood Hills cemetery, most notably Michael Jackson's tomb at Forest Lawn's Great Mausoleum. Other stars laid to rest there include Liberace, Lucille Ball, John Ritter and Brittany Murphy. According to RadarOnline, the Fast & The Furious star was transferred from the mortuary at Los Angeles cemetery Forest Lawn Memorial Park to a crematory in Glendale, California on Thursday. A source told the website the family 'intends on dividing Paul's ashes between an urn and keepsakes.' Saturday's service: Paul walker Sr. and son Cody Walker arranging last details for Paul Walker's Funeral as several dozen mourners clad in black arrived at Hollywood's Forest Lawn Cemetery to say goodbye . Final picture: Walker is pictured in the car moments before it careered off the road and hit a tree killing him and the driver . Walker was killed last month when the Porsche he was traveling in crashed and burned in Santa Clarita. On Wednesday, Walker's father, Paul Walker Sr., brother, Cody Walker, 25, and other family members finalised plans for the actor's funeral service. They also walked around the grounds of the cemetery, choosing a grave site plot. His family will mourn the star in a very private service, though TMZ reported certain cast and crew from the 'Fast & Furious' movies will be invited because he considered them kin. The Walkers were keen, however, to avoid throngs of media and fans, to protect the actor's daughter Meadow, 15, who is 'broken up' over her dad's death.","Family and close friends gathered to laugh, eat and play football at a beachside memorial on the Santa Barbara shore on Sunday .

"By . Mark Duell . These eerie scenes show soldiers rehearsing in the fog for a reburial ceremony after the bodies of 20 British First World War soldiers were found. The only man of those discovered to have been identified by name is Private William McAleer, from the 7th Battalion the Royal Scottish Fusiliers. His relatives will be represented at the service tomorrow in Loos-en-Gohelle, France, by his step-great-nephew - almost 100 years after he died. The 20 bodies were found at a construction site of a new prison being built in October 2010, where the Battle of Loos took place in September 1915. Soldiers of The 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland are rehearsing in Loos, with 19 unidentified men set to be buried as ‘Known Unto God’.

Getting ready: Corporal Stuart Gillies of The 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland practises his bagpipes in Loos British Cemetery during a rehearsal . Moving: Almost 100 years after they were killed in 1915, 20 British soldiers will be re-interred in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Loos British Cemetery . Peter Francis, of the Commonwealth War . Graves Commission, revealed there are around 20 cases of discovered . remains of soldiers each year. He told MailOnline today: ‘These casualties were discovered at a construction site of a new prison being built. ‘During . work preparing the ground for that, they found what appeared to be a . battleground grave, which also contained some 30 German casualties. ‘From the location and regiments involved, initial indications were that these were from the Battle of Loos in September 1915.’ The . Battle of Loos featured the first British use of poison gas, and . followed a four-day artillery bombardment along a six-and-a-half-mile . front. The attack led by Sir . Douglas Haig happened simultaneously as the French attacked the German . lines at Champagne and at Vimy Ridge in Arras. Found: Private William McAleer, from the 7th Battalion the Royal Scottish Fusiliers, was found with his identity disc, but others found with him remain unidentified . Carrying the coffin: The 20 bodies were discovered at a construction site of a new prison being built in October 2010, where the Battle of Loos took place in 1915 . Discovery: Six soldiers were from the Royal Scots Fusiliers, two from the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, and one from the Northumberland Fusiliers . But the Germans were able to . successfully hold their position on both fronts, helped by a second line . of trenches built six miles behind the front lines. Mr Francis said that 13766 Private McAleer's body was identified only because he happened to have a metal identification tag on him. He . added: ‘This is slightly unusual because British soldiers didn’t have . metal ID tags during the First World War, so this was something he'd got . himself. ‘In 1916 they . brought in the two tags, but they were made of a compressed cardboard, . not metal - but soldiers often brought their own metal ones.’ Private McAleer’s father was a miner and died in a pit accident, and his mother . later remarried - explaining the step-great-nephew, Mr Francis said. He has until now been commemorated on the Loos Memorial. His regiment landed in France on July 9, 1915, and he was killed on September 26. Mr Francis added: ‘The remains were recovered by the Commission and kept safe in . our mortuary, near Arras. Then the Ministry of Defence got involved. Ruins of Loos: The battle featured the first British use of poison gas, and followed a four-day artillery bombardment along a six-and-a-half-mile front. Devastation: The attack in Loos led by Sir Douglas Haig happened simultaneously as the French attacked the German lines at Champagne and at Vimy Ridge in Arras. ‘They have a unit called the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre – they deal with present-day military casualties but also historical cases as well. ‘They began the lengthy task of looking at whether or not they can identify these individuals.’ The 19 unidentified soldiers are labelled only as ‘Known Unto God’ - a description on headstones which was chosen by author Rudyard Kipling. But for 10 of those soldiers, their regiment has been identified thanks to their clothing. One was from the Yorkshire and Lancashire regiment. Six were from the Royal Scots Fusiliers, two from the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, and one from the Northumberland Fusiliers. Mr Francis said that under battlefield . conditions, both sides would try to bury their fallen and the other . sides fallen, if there was a lull in the fighting. Memorial: The Commonwealth War Graves Commission said there are around 187,000 graves from the First World War that have the 'Known Unto God' inscription . Well-maintained: Corporal Gillies of The 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland practices his bagpipes during the rehearsal in Loos-en-Gohelle, France . Bagpipes: Under battlefield conditions, both sides would try to bury their fallen and the other sides fallen, if there was a lull in the fighting . He added: ‘It may have been a case of digging a pit, or using a shellhole, and give the men the best burial they could in those circumstances.’ Mr Francis said there are around 187,000 graves from the First World War that have the ‘Known Unto God’ inscription. He said: ‘You watch the young men of what would have been his antecedent regiment, and they are burying one of their own - it’s a moving experience.’ A Ministry of Defence spokesman told MailOnline of Private McAleer: ‘We know that his blood relatives emigrated to the US and Canada. ‘We do have a great-step nephew, who is coming. The person who’s coming tomorrow is descended from the mother’s son. He also has a brother.’","Only man identified by name was Private William McAleer, from the 7th Battalion the Royal Scottish Fusiliers .

"By . Robert Verkaik . The Guardian newspaper sent top-secret files containing classified information to the United States by household courier FedEx, it was revealed last night. The security risk is the latest to engulf the newspaper after the head of MI5 warned last week that publication of confidential data leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden had caused huge ‘harm’ to the capability of Britain’s intelligence services. Last night, senior security figures lambasted the newspaper for using Federal Express to carry the encrypted files. 'Huge damage': The leaks from former intelligence worker Edward Snowden, pictured here received an award while in exile in Moscow, have been condemned by intelligence experts . Former anti-terror law watchdog Alex Carlile QC said the decision may have put the lives of British spies in danger. ‘I think it is astonishing that top-secret material has been placed in a public parcel delivery system,’ he said. Security chiefs are also understood to be ‘very concerned’ at the use of a courier company. One source said: ‘Any leak like this is extremely concerning and part of that concern is the handling arrangements.’ The data – from GCHQ, the Government’s secret communications headquarters – was copied from the original Snowden cache on to a USB memory stick and sent by FedEx to a ‘disguised’ US intermediary in June this year. Measures were taken to ensure its safe passage. He was told that if The Guardian was ‘muzzled’ he was to make sure the material was published on ProPublica, a not-for-profit New York website which publishes investigative journalism. Weeks later, GCHQ officials visited the newspaper’s London offices to destroy computers and hard drives in the belief they had closed the security breach. 'Parlour games': The Guardian, edited by Alan Rusbridger, pictured, has been accused of endangering MI5 and MI6 agents . The decision to send the files by courier is believed to have been taken within days of Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger returning from America, where he had been working with the Guardian’s New York office on how to handle the fall-out from the Snowden leaks. Mr Rusbridger has since admitted he was worried the Government would seek an injunction to seize the material, preventing any further publication of the Snowden files. According to a report last week in The New Yorker, Mr Rusbridger sent a ‘Federal Express package containing a thumbnail drive of selected Snowden documents to an intermediary in the US’. The magazine told The Mail on Sunday that it stood by its story, which had been ‘multiple sourced’. The Government only became aware that material may have been sent out of the country when Rusbridger met Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and the Prime Minister’s head of communications, Craig Oliver, at The Guardian’s offices on June 21. According to The New Yorker, Rusbridger hinted that the Government might be too late to prevent publication of further material. On July 20, The Guardian gave permission for officers from GCHQ to destroy hard drives holding the secret files at its King’s Cross offices. Vulnerable: The Guardian reportedly uploaded a cache of intelligence files into a USB memory stick to send them to the USA . Two days later, The Guardian admitted to the Government that ‘secret material’ had been given to ProPublica. It is not clear whether The Guardian told the intelligence  services that the material had been sent by FedEx, when it was sent or where from. Last night, Stephen Engelberg, editor-in-chief of ProPublica, confirmed he had received the files. He said: ‘The material is in our possession. It’s in a safe place. At one point we were told the Crown was going to ask for it back but they never did.’ He confirmed the memory stick ‘was sent’ but when asked how or from where, he said: ‘I’m not going to go into that... It came through. 'I don’t know how it got to me. It found its way through. We were prepared had they been injuncted to do what needed to be done’. Last night, the revelations about the sending of secrets was branded ‘astonishing’ by Lord Carlile, who called on the Attorney General to consider legal action against the newspaper. Lord Carlile accused The Guardian of playing ‘a parlour game’ with national security. His comments are at odds with other leading Lib Dems, including Business Secretary Vince Cable, who have supported The Guardian. Special delivery: The Guardian used the Fedex parcel service to deliver the files . He said: ‘I am very surprised The Guardian has not paid enough attention to comments by Andrew Parker [MI5 director general] and others about the damage these disclosures have done or can still do to national security. 'There are individuals whose safety might be affected by these disclosures. We are talking about MI5, MI6 and the national security agents of other countries. 'I think it is astonishing that a large amount of top-secret material has been placed in a public parcel delivery system. 'I think it is quite wrong that it should have been sent outside the country to avoid the jurisdiction of the UK courts. 'I hope the Attorney General will examine what The Guardian has done to determine whether there is any action to be taken. National security is not a parlour game.’ Attorney General Dominic Grieve could seek an injunction against The Guardian to deliver up the material. 'If refused, the editor would be in contempt of court and could be imprisoned for up to two years. Last night, The Guardian refused to say how the material was sent. A spokesman said: ‘An encrypted form of a limited number of documents was safely sent to ProPublica. We’re not going to talk about what those documents were.’ In 2010, FedEx was at the centre of the printer bomb alert when an Al Qaeda bomb was found at its depot in Dubai. And in 2006, a former employee admitted selling confidential account numbers of clients using FedEx’s London depot. An earlier version of this article . indicated that the number of files the Guardian FedExed to America was . tens of thousands; the Guardian has since indicated that it numbered . less than 100. The newspaper also said that the files it FedExed to America did not contain any names of British spies. Snowden's treachery has put the lives of our spies at risk: Comment by Richard Kemp, ex-chairman of COBRA intelligence committee . Richard Kemp, pictured, argues that Snowden's leaks have jeopardised national security . Despite the self-righteous pomposity of Edward Snowden, who claims from his FSB-protected  Moscow hideout that he doesn’t want to live in a society that places its citizens under surveillance, his revelations about the secret state have told us little. GCHQ exists precisely to do what Snowden has ‘uncovered’. Who is genuinely surprised that, in its efforts to protect this country, GCHQ is monitoring all possible terrorist means of communication? Who wouldn’t be outraged if it were it not? What Snowden has done by revealing the detail of collection techniques as well as vast quantities of highly sensitive intelligence material, is jeopardise our national security and the lives of those who take great risks to protect us. To expose at the very least 58,000 secret and top secret British intelligence documents to the gaze of Chinese and Russian authorities and to publicise the details of intelligence collection capability is the most damaging act of betrayal in the history of intelligence treachery. There is no question the Chinese and the Russians will be pulling out the stops to exploit this windfall. The same applies to our tech-savvy jihadist enemies, who are more than capable of rapidly learning the lessons Snowden has taught them. I am no less troubled than anyone else about the extent to which private citizens are spied on. In my opinion only one thing can justify the range and scale of activity that MI5, GCHQ and the NSA are engaged in. That is a serious and lethal threat to the people of this country. Today that threat comes from terrorism. As a soldier I have fought terrorism and been attacked by terrorists. Involved in intelligence work in London, Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, I have read and analysed thousand upon thousand of secret intelligence reports including phone and email intercepts. I know first-hand the danger that we face from terrorism and the vital role intelligence plays in protecting us from it. Some 100 years ago Britain’s Naval Intelligence Division intercepted every message sent on transatlantic cables between Europe and the United States. This was extremely risky as it involved intercepting communications between neutral powers, but nobody today would question its ultimate legitimacy or its value in defeating the Kaiser. Compared with an all-out struggle for national survival, use of such measures in the shadowy fight against terrorism might seem harder to reconcile. But it is just  as important nontheless. Few would argue with targeted surveillance against known suspects. But we cannot then ignore the unknown terrorists. And in collecting information, the intelligence services have no choice but to collect material that has nothing to do with terrorism. While working for the Joint Intelligence Committee and Cobra,  I was involved with many cases where GCHQ and NSA communications intelligence led directly to the disruption of terrorist activity both here in the UK and against British soldiers and civilians abroad. Communications intercept has played a significant role in every important MI5 terrorist investigation since 9/11, with more than 330 suspects convicted of terrorism offences. Snowden is only partially responsible for the harm that he has done. Far greater culpability lies with the US intelligence apparatus for permitting such damaging theft of their secret intelligence, especially in the wake of the Bradley Manning fiasco. By bringing their clearly inadequate internal security measures up to date, the NSA can and must prevent recurrence of Snowden’s betrayal.","The newspaper saved files from leaker Edward Snowden to a USB stick .

"By . David Wilkes . Paralysed by grief, Sarah Ambrose could not bear to look at her son’s  belongings after he was killed at the Battle of the Somme. So 18-year-old Edward Ambrose’s possessions were packed in a leather suitcase and stored away in the attic of the family home. And there they stayed for more than 90 years – until curiosity finally got the better of Edward’s nephew John, 82, who retrieved the case after reading about an appeal for untold stories for a First World War exhibition. The 'time capsule' includes a locket containing photos of Private Ambrose and his sweetheart 'Gladys', who he left at home to go and fight on the Western Front . Amazingly, Private Ambrose's nephew, John, also found two fragments of the German shell which killed his uncle in the Battle of the Somme on July 6, 1916. Records show in was struck in the leg by a shell when his line came under heavy bombardment . Touchingly, the case included a guide book to Paris, which Private Ambrose sadly never got to visit. A picture of Private Ambrose's grieving mother Sarah, right . The case contains poignant reminders of Private Ambrose's final days before his death, including a half-smoked pipe and ten cigarettes in a case designed to take 14 . Among the photos in the case is one of Private Ambrose, third from the right, stood outside his home near Baldock, Hertforshire with three of his fellow soldiers and his father, Samuel, right . Another of his photos shows him and fellow soldiers at the Duke of Bedford's Training Depot in Ampthill, Bedfordshire in 1915. He joined the 6th Battalion of the Bedfordshire Regiment . The locket Private Ambrose gave to Gladys contained the inscription 'Mizpah', meaning emotional bond, and the message: 'The Lord watch between me and thee when we are absent from one another' Private Ambrose's half-smoked pipe. His grieving parents found it too difficult to open the case of his personal belongings and put it into storage, where it has remained for 98 years . The case contains heartfelt letters sent by Private Ambrose from the front to his parents back home. He states that he 'takes pleasure' in writing them, and signs off 'Your loving son, Ted' Opening it, he was confronted with a . poignant collection of letters and photographs alongside a locket with a . picture of fresh-faced Edward on one side and his sweetheart Gladys on . the other. In a letter from Samuel Ambrose to his son before he went off to war, the father wrote: 'Dear son, just a few lines to you trusting they will find you quite well and in the best of health. 'No doubt you will think it strange to get a letter from dad but I thought I must just write you a few lines before you sail away from home. 'I remind you that you are quite young so therefore you must try and take great care of yourself and don’t forget to ask your heavenly father to help you. 'We will all pray to God for you and for your safe return home again when the war is ended and trust in him that it may soon be finished with and lasting peace so that we all live happily again. 'Take great care of this letter and read it sometimes and then you won’t forget to do what I have asked of you. 'Let us know as often as you can how you are getting along and if there is anything that you want if we can. 'I think this is all so with all our best love from one and all to you and heaps of kisses, your loving dad S Ambrose.' There were also Army issue booklets, posthumously awarded . campaign medals and everyday paraphernalia, including cigarette papers . and even a pipe with tobacco still in it. Incredibly, . the case also contained two fragments of the German shell that . inflicted the fatal wounds on Private Ambrose shortly after he went to . the front in July 1916. Also . in the time capsule was a guide book to Paris, which the young soldier . never got the chance to visit, and a phrase book titled ‘What a British . soldier wants to say in French and how to pronounce it’. There was also a . letter which his father Samuel, a farm bailiff  from Wallington, near . Baldock, Hertfordshire, wrote to his son on the eve of him going to . France in February 1916. It . said: ‘We will all pray to God for you and for your safe return home . again. Take care of this letter and read it sometimes and then you won’t . forget what I have asked of you. Your loving dad, S Ambrose.’ Private . Ambrose, the eldest of six children, joined the 6th Battalion, . Bedfordshire Regiment in 1915. After going to France, he spent two . spells in hospital with German measles then tinnitus and shell shock, . his service record shows. His last letter home was dated July 6, five . days into the Somme offensive and three days before he was fatally . wounded. In it, he wrote of how he was thinking of when he would be . going home again. On July 9 . he was struck in the leg and head by shell fragments. He died at the Red . Cross Hospital at Etaples on July 13. Found in the case was a telegram . from the War Office to his mother,  who had asked if she could visit him . while he was wounded in hospital. The . message declining her request as he was too ‘gravely wounded’ did not . get to  her until the day after he died of his injuries. A second . telegram confirming his death arrived a few days later. The . case of possessions was inherited by Private Ambrose’s sister Margaret . and then passed on to her sons John and David. They got it out of the . attic after seeing an appeal by the Herts at War project, an exhibition . to mark the 100th anniversary of the start  of the war. John, . from Letchworth, Hertfordshire, said: ‘It was only when we opened the . case that we realised the extent of the archive. It is a very moving, . especially the letters.’ Private . Ambrose is buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery at Etaples in . France. His belongings will go on display at the exhibition in August. As part of his planned visit to Paris, Private Ambrose had also taken a French phrase book to the front, entitled: 'What a British soldier wants to say in French and how to pronounce it' A local newspaper obituary from July 1916 telling of Private Ambrose's death.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A quickly draining battery can be a pain for many iPhone users. But it turns out one of the most popular apps might be to blame. A former Apple Store Genius has unearthed evidence that the Facebook app is eating away at your phone’s juice. Is Facebook draining your battery? A former Apple Store employee has discovered that the popular third-party app runs processes in the battery that can decrease your phone's juice . According to Scotty Loveless from Overthought.org: 'I just got the iPhone 5s about two weeks ago, and thought my battery was draining a little too quickly. ‘Being the nerd that I am, I decided to run the app Instruments from Xcode, Apple’s developer tool, in order to see what the problem was. ‘During this testing, Facebook kept jumping up on the process list even thought I wasn’t using it. ‘So I tried disabling Location Services and Background App Refresh for Facbook.' Doing this, Loveless noticed that his battery percentage increased from 12% to 17%. Disable Background App Refresh for apps other than Facebook. Turn off push email. Stop push notifications from apps you don't use frequently. Turn on airplane mode when you haven't got a signal anyway. Stop closing apps, as your phone uses more battery each time it opens them again. ‘I have confirmed this behaviour on multiple iPhones with the same result,’ continues Loveless. ‘Bad, Facebook, bad.’ Fortunately, as Loveless points out, there is an easy fix. Navigating to Settings > Privacy > Location Services will enable you to turn off Location Services for Facebook. Then go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh to turn that functionality off for Facebook. One of the reasons for this might be that Facebook is introducing more features as it bids to become your number one communications service. This isn’t the first time Facebook has been caught causing phone users trouble, though . Previously in January MailOnline reported that the app was reading your texts, which the company claims is required for security reasons. You can turn off Location Services for Facebook within the iOS Settings menu to save battery life . Heading into your settings will also allow you to turn off 'Background App Refresh' for Facebook, saving more battery life but at the expense of not getting constant updates .","A former Apple employee found that Facebook was draining battery .
Background processes on iPhones run by the app eat up as much as 5% .
This keeps the app updated and gives you push notifications .

"By . Jack Doyle And David Williams . The lives of British agents may have been put at risk by a Guardian journalist’s possession of top-secret documents stolen from the US  government, a senior Cabinet adviser has warned. Documents seized from the reporter’s boyfriend, David Miranda, were so sensitive that agents have since had to be moved to protect their lives. Oliver Robbins, deputy national security adviser at the Cabinet Office, went on the record to warn that ‘lives may be put at risk’ if the documents fall in to the wrong hands. Threat: Files seized from David Miranda (left), pictured with his partner Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, posed a threat to national security, the High Court heard . Court papers released yesterday also . revealed the incredibly lax security used around the material, with Mr . Miranda apparently carrying a password for some of the computer . documents written on a scrap of paper. Security . sources also said that, as a result of the theft, codes for tens of . thousands of sensitive documents have had to be changed. Details . of the chaos caused at the highest levels of Britain’s security and . intelligence agencies by the leaks emerged in official court submissions . about material seized from Mr Miranda, the boyfriend of Guardian . journalist Glenn Greenwald. Mr . Miranda, 28, who is Brazilian, was detained at Heathrow on August 18 as . he passed through the airport on his way from Berlin to Rio. He . was found to be carrying nine hard disks and memory sticks including . secret files leaked by former CIA analyst Edward Snowden, and was . questioned for nine hours before being released. Mr Miranda’s detention under terrorism powers provoked outrage from civil liberties groups. But . the newspaper’s initial story described him only as Mr Greenwald’s . boyfriend, and made no mention of the fact that he was carrying secret . material or that the Guardian was paying for his flights. Despite . only decrypting one third of the material, police have already . discovered 58,000 classified documents, many marked secret or top . secret. Secret: Mr Greenwald helped US whistle blower Edward Snowden reveal details of the work of  US National Security Agency . In a statement to . the High Court, Mr Robbins said the material was likely to contain . details of secret techniques used to prevent terror attacks, personal . data about agents at home and abroad and ‘other intelligence activities . vital to UK national security’. The . release of the information could pose a ‘direct threat to the life of . UK government employees’, as well as threaten the lives of their . families. Mr Robbins warned . the judges – who granted additional powers to the police to examine the . classified material – that the information that had been decrypted ‘has . had a direct impact on decisions taken in regard to staff deployments . and is therefore impacting operational effectiveness’. He . wrote: ‘The material seized is highly likely to describe techniques . which have been crucial in life-saving counter-terrorism operations, and . other intelligence activities vital to UK national security. The . compromise of these methods would do serious damage to UK national . security, and ultimately risk lives.’ He added: ‘A particular concern for HMG is the possibility that the identity of a UK intelligence officer might be revealed.’ GCHQ, . the Government’s communications headquarters, and the police are using a . large amount of resources to decrypt and process the material, Mr . Robbins said. He warned of . the urgent need to identify what other material is on the hard drives . ‘to assess the risks to sensitive intelligence sources and methods, and . the threat to intelligence agency staff should their identities or . details of their operational tradecraft be obtained by hostile actors’. Mr . Robbins said the Guardian’s publication of details from the documents . had already caused ‘real and serious damage’ to national security. Alan Rusbridger, the editor of  the Guardian, branded his claims ‘unsubstantiated and inaccurate’. He . said: ‘The Guardian took every decision on what to publish very slowly . and very carefully and when we met with government officials in July . they acknowledged that we had displayed a “responsible” attitude. ‘The . Government’s behaviour does not match their rhetoric in trying to . justify and exploit this dismaying blurring of terrorism and . journalism.’","High Court hears David Miranda had 'highly classified' UK intelligence files .

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . The former child star who played Robin Williams' youngest daughter in Mrs Doubtfire, has written a touching tribute to her on-screen father. Mara Wilson was just 5 years old when she starred in the hit-comedy about divorce and hadn't spoken to Williams in a few years when she learned the news about his suicide last week. In a post on her blog Mara Wilson Writes Stuff, the 27-year-old playwright fondly recalls her days on the Mrs Doubtfire set and how she regrets losing touch with Williams. 'I wish we had talked more. I wish I had reached out more,' she writes. Scroll down for video . Father figure: Mara Wilson (left), the former child actress who played Robin Williams youngest daughter in Mrs Doubtfire, has written a touching tribute to her on-screen father . Wilson was just 5 years old when she appeared in Mrs Doubtfire. She is now 27 and working for a nonprofit organization in New York. She says she was shocked and saddened to learn of Williams death. Wilson pictured on the left in June 2013 . Mrs Doubtfire is one of Williams defining roles, in which he plays a father who cross-dresses as a nanny to get closer to his three children in the midst of a bitter divorce with his wife, played by Sally Field. While Wilson was quite young during filming, she still remembers Williams constantly trying to entertain her and the other kids even when the cameras weren't rolling. 'Those hand puppets that dance alongside the genie in Aladdin's ""Friend Like Me""? That must have been his suggestion, because Robin made those in real life. He’d break them out between takes to entertain us between takes. '“I don’t like you,” his left hand would say to his right. “You smell like poop!” I would laugh uproariously — I was five, so poop jokes were the height of hilarity — as his right hand yelled back “Well, there’s no toilet paper at my house!” Entertainer: Mara says Williams would do anything to make her and the other kids laugh on set . Remembering: The home that served as the exterior for the Mrs Doubtfire house in San Francisco became the sight of a memorial after news of Williams suicide . For Robin: Some of the flowers and memorabilia set on the steps of the Mrs Doubtfire house . 'When we were filming the climactic dinner party scene, he would make his carpet bag bark like a dog under the table, then order it to be quiet. 'He seemed to know instinctively what we would find funny, and never had to resort to saying anything that was inappropriate for children. He was, after all, a father himself.' Wilson and Williams lost touch, and she says the last time she saw him was a few years ago, when she was a freshman at NYU and she ran into him while he was filming August Rush in Washington Square Park. 'He told me how grown up I looked and asked how I liked NYU. It was small talk, but something about the way Robin looked at me made it feel like he truly cared. This was someone for whom everything mattered,' Wilson recalls. Wilson says she regrets losing touch with Williams, and especially not getting to explain to him why she declined a role in the planned Mrs Doubtfire sequel. 'I had thought maybe the next time I saw Robin I would explain myself to him, let him know that I had loved working with him but didn’t feel like we could do it again, and that being in major studio films again meant a level of scrutiny I didn’t think I could deal with. Heartbroken: Wilson says she's been too sad to give an interview. Above, a tweet she posted after learning of Williams' death . 'I wanted to apologize and know he understood. It hurts to know I can’t,' she says. Wilson says news of Williams death has left her shocked and sad, and that she still hasn't been able to muster the strength to give an interview. However, she says she's been comforted by the outpouring of love for Williams online. 'If you can affect someone when they're young, you're in their heart forever. It is remarkable how many lives Robin touched, and how many people said, just as I had, that he reminded them of their fathers,' Wilson writes. Young Wilson issues one of Mrs Doubtfire's most famous lines, mimicking her father by precociously telling her mother 'we're his goddamn kids too' when she picks them up from a visitation day. Wilson says that line rings true today, for anyone who grew up watching Williams' films. Mara Wilson no longer acts, but lives in New York as a playwright. She also works for non-profit organization Publicolor. In addition to Mrs Doubtfire, Wilson starred in Matilda and Miracle on 34th Street.","Mara Wilson, 27, was just 5 years old when she filmed the comedy that became one of Williams' defining roles ."
"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . A worker who was helping to repair the fire-ravaged Eastbourne Pier tragically fell to his death yesterday. Stephen Penrice, 44, of Netherton, Cumbria, was helping to rebuild the structure when he fell through a boardwalk onto the beach. The pier - the East Sussex town's main tourist attraction - was devastated last month when a huge blaze took hold in its Grade II listed amusement arcade. A workman helping to rebuild the fire damaged Eastbourne Pier has fallen onto the beach and died . It is believed Mr Penrice was working for Cumbria-based contractor MPM North West Ltd when he fell from a rig on the east side of the pier yesterday. Emergency services were called shortly after 4pm and an air ambulance landed on the beach. It is believed two off-duty nurses also battled to save the construction worker's life. An eyewitness said: 'I came along as the police and ambulance were down on the beach next to the pier. I heard that a workman had fallen through the pier. 'I saw them trying to resuscitate him and then a helicopter arrived. It was there for an awfully long time.' A spokesman for MPM North West Ltd said: 'It is with great sorrow that we must announce the tragedy which happened at Eastbourne Pier yesterday. 'We are currently liaising with the police and the Health & Safety Executive to investigate this accident. 'Our thoughts and feelings are with the family members and friends who are suffering over this difficult time.' Sussex Police will be joined by investigators from the Health and Safety Executive today to look into the incident. On July 30, tourists and locals watched in horror as fire destroyed part of the 144-year-old pier. At its height, up to 80 firefighters tackled the inferno on the Victorian attraction, which left the dome-shaped amusement arcade near the entrance a scorched shell. No one was trapped by the blaze and the pier was evacuated quickly without injury or loss of life. The government has since announced a £2million injection into the town to help boost its economy in the aftermath of the fire.

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . Scam: Cyclist Jack Cartwright, 24, tricked a driver into thinking she had injured his ankle, before his accomplice drove off in her car . A retired nurse was tricked into thinking she had hit a cyclist by thieves who then drove off in her £15,000 Volkswagen when she got out to help. Cyclist Jack Cartwright, 24, pretended . that he had injured his ankle, prompting the driver, Anne Boydell, to jump out of her . VW Tiguan 4x4 in Ashton, Greater Manchester, to help him. He told her that his ankle was swelling, but when the retired nurse asked him to show her his other ankle so she could compare them she noticed that he was wearing an electronic tag and guessed it was a scam. Another man suddenly appeared, jumped into her vehicle and drove off, as Cartwright leapt onto his bike and followed him, Liverpool Crown Court heard. Mrs Boydell, from Wigan, was left . stranded without her phone or handbag, which had been in the car and . contained a large sum of cash and her house keys. Police recovered Cartwright’s socks at the scene but before they could be swabbed for DNA, he was identified from CCTV footage and arrested on two weeks later. Cartwright, from St Helens, Merseyside later admitted to theft. His accomplice, who is known to police, has not yet been tracked down and the vehicle, worth £15,000 is also still missing. It was spotted several days after the incident with false registration plates and being driven by the other man, Peter Barr, prosecuting, told the court. At the time of the theft, on June 19, Cartwright, who has 16 previous convictions, had been ordered to wear the electronic tag and had a suspended prison sentence hanging over him after a criminal damage offence. Jailing him for two years Judge Alan Conrad, QC, told Cartwright today that he had 'a dreadful record' and that it had been 'a sophisticated offence'. Missing: Mrs Boydell's £15,000 Volkswagen Tiguan (similar to this model) has never been found . Trick: As Mrs Boydell guessed she was being tricked, another man suddenly appeared, jumped into her vehicle and drove off, while Cartwright leapt onto his bike and followed him, Liverpool Crown Court heard . He told the court that Cartwright had decided not to tell police where the car was, although he has since revealed where he last saw it. The judge also said he was concerned by Cartwright’s unremorseful attitude when interviewed by a probation officer. Judge Conrad ordered that the 12 week suspended sentence which Cartwright had breached should be served consecutively and he banned him from driving for two years.","Cyclist Jack Cartwright, 24, pretended he had injured his ankle .

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . Dr Samina Tahseen, who removed the wrong fallopian tube from a patient, has been cleared to work again without supervision . A doctor who removed the wrong fallopian tube from a patient - leaving the woman unable to conceive naturally - is now free to return to work. The patient lost both her fallopian tubes within three days after Dr Samina Tahseen mistook a benign tumour for the ectopic pregnancy she was supposed to remove. The gynaecologist failed to see the patient before her operation, read her medical records or properly examine her during the procedure on September 21, 2010. She then insisted she had removed the correct fallopian tube and sent the patient home despite the woman knowing something was desperately wrong. Dr Tahseen was allowed to continue to work under conditions despite being found guilty of serious misconduct by a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) panel two years ago. The panel said the medic put her patient's 'life at risk' by discharging her with an untreated ectopic pregnancy, which later ruptured. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg begins to develop outside of the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes. The pregnancy can cause life-threatening bleeding if left untreated. The patient - called Patient A during the disciplinary proceedings - had to return to the Royal Derby Hospital three days after the botched operation to have her other fallopian tube removed. A standards hearing in 2012 found the doctor had been 'hasty, careless, and dismissive' before, during and after the procedure and her actions had 'undermined public confidence in the medical profession'. Dr Tahseen was made subject to a string of conditions, which restricted her practise and kept her closely monitored by the General Medical Council. But those conditions have now been revoked, after the MPTS found she is now fit to practise again. Panel chair Dr Harvey Marcovitch said: 'It [the panel] considers that you have now accepted responsibility for your misconduct, both in relation to Patient A and your relationships with colleagues, . 'The panel has read the supportive testimonials from colleagues, who have noted marked improvements in your communication and collaboration, for example in taking advice when appropriate and that you have demonstrated insight into your behaviour and practice. Dr Tahseen appeared before another standards panel earlier this month, which found she is now fit to practise . He added: 'The panel now considers that the behavioural concerns arising from your misconduct have been remedied; that you have demonstrated full insight into that misconduct and that you fully appreciate the impact of your behaviour on colleagues and the impact on Patient A of your actions. 'It considers that there is no risk of recurrence of similar misconduct. 'Furthermore, public confidence in the profession has been maintained and proper standards upheld in consequence of the restrictions on your practice that have applied for the last four years. 'Taking into account all the evidence, the Panel has determined that your fitness to practise is not currently impaired. 'Accordingly, the conditions imposed on your registration are revoked with immediate effect.' Dr Tahseen is now free to return to work without restrictions.","Dr Samina Tahseen found to have been 'hasty and careless' during operation .

Antony Britton was wriggling out of a strait-jacket suspended by burning ropes during a performance in Bradford, West Yorkshire when the accident happened. The daredevil didn't realise that high winds would speed up the time it took the flames to burn through the ropes, meaning he had to dislocate his shoulder before being lowered to the ground.

Mr Britton was performing at the Escape for Life event earlier this month, which was planned to raise money for a multiple sclerosis charity World Multiple Sclerosis. He was attempting to escape from a strait-jacket as he hung, suspended upside, from three burning ropes. But the crowds who had gathered for the event were left shocked when the fire burned through two of the ropes too quickly. Mr Britton was left suspended by just one rope and was lowered to the ground after dislocating his shoulder. He said: 'The ropes burned through too quickly. I can usually count on 60 seconds before the first rope burns through, but it was more like 45 seconds, which was too fast. 'The second rope went after 60 seconds and the third would have been another 30 seconds before that burned through.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . A metal worker in Florida claims he killed a burly co-worker with a shotgun out of self-defense after years of abuse. Manuel Acosta, 69, is on trial in Miami-Dade for the shooting death of Jose Valdez, 50, in May 2010. He's accused of reloading his shotgun repeatedly, firing at least 10 times. Two of the shots struck Valdez, killing him. Defense attorneys argued that the 5-foot-3 Acosta, who weighed just 125 pounds at the time, had been punched and kicked for years by the 'giant' Valdez, who weighed some 423 pounds, the Miami Herald reported. 'To save his own life, Mr. Acosta was forced to kill Mr. Valdez,' said Lauren Krasnoff, a public defender,  told jurors, the paper reported. Manuel Acosta (right), 69, appears in court on Wednesday. He is on trial in Miami-Dade for the shooting death of Jose Valdez, 50, a co-worker who Acosta claims bullied him for years . Acosta and Valdez worked together at the San Judas Tadeo Foundry, a six-employee metal factory in the industrial town of . Medley, Miami-Dade County. Acosta had been at the factory for about 15 years, where he also lived in a trailer along with his four dogs. Valdez had been at the factory for four years and slept in a room inside a warehouse. The older worker said Valdez 'became an abuser' who would bully him and his dogs. The night of the attack, Valdez came after Acosta with a glass bottle and 'charged at him' while Acosta was cleaning his shotgun, defense lawyers claim. Acosta 'fought for his life,' he told authorities. But prosecutors say that, though Valdez was large, he was unarmed while Acosta pursued him 'like a hunter stalking his prey.' 'Jose Valdez was on the ground begging for his life,' said prosecutor Paige Saperstein, the Miami Herald reported.

"By . Freya Noble . Shocking footage has emerged of two out-of-control adult women yelling at each other and throwing punches on an inner-city train platform. Believed to have taken place at Melbourne's Flinders Street Station, one female dressed in a blue jumper, black scarf and green cargo pants can be seen marching down the platform. 'What did you say!' the woman in cargo pants yells at a lady wearing a grey jumper, pink shirt, tight black pants and what look to be legwarmers. Scroll down for video . Two women have been caught on camera brawling at Flinders Street Station in Melbourne . The ladies had an intense a confrontation which an amused onlooker capturing it on film . 'She ain't no thing', the one in legwarmers responds, before the first woman repeats her initial question: 'What did you say?' The female in cargo pants can then be seen taking the first swing at her opponent, and during the scuffle some pretty serious slapping sounds can be heard. Then all of a sudden the woman in legwarmers lashes out and pushes the one in cargo pants backwards so she ends up sprawled on the train tracks. One woman wearing cargo pants approached another in legwarmers and the pair started to scream at each other . One woman pushes the other onto the train tracks after she took a swing at her, before doing a strange victory dance on the platform . An arrogant victory dance then takes place and the woman still standing screams 'Don't f*** with me - boom!' The man who filmed the encounter can hardly contain his amusement, and throughout the ordeal provides some commentary, while at other times simply bursts into laughter. As the woman in the cargo pants tries to climb back onto the platform, the other female takes a swing at her with her leg in attempt to keep her down. Then as she tries to kick her opponent to keep her down she falls herself . However it's all downhill from there as the force of her own kick sends the legwarmer wearing lady flying down onto the train tracks as well. Both women then stand up next to each other, still on the train tracks looking rather puzzled at what just unfolded. It is unclear what followed at the video finishes but it seems they both escaped and injury by a train, despite how disastrous the results could have been.","The women are said to have been at Flinders Street Station in Melbourne .
