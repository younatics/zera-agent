"Edible: The Survival Senbei iPhone 5 case is . handmade from Japanese brown rice and salt, and is available online for . just £30 plus shipping . The iPhone fan scene across the planet has proved a ready and willing market for entrepreneurs marketing a range of accessories. This may be the most idiosyncratic yet, however. One enterprising Japanese businesswoman has created an iPhone 5 case that you can eat. Made entirely from Japanese brown rice and salt, the Survival Senbei iPhone 5 case is intended not so much to protect your phone, but to keep you going in the event of a large-scale natural disaster. The entrepreneur behind the Survival Senbei is a middle-aged master senbei artisan called Mariko. Senbei, traditional rice crackers, are the snack of choice for older Japanese, and Mariko came up with the senbei smartphone case as a way to broaden its appeal to the younger generation. The cases are available to buy online at a cost of ¥3,818 (which, RocketNews24 reports, is a Japanese mnemonic pun on the word 'survival'). That works out to around £30, plus shipping. Depending on demand, delivery can take up to a month because, Mariko explains, 'I can make about three good ones a day.' The entrepreneur behind the Survival Senbei is a middle-aged master senbei artisan called Mariko: Senbei are the snack of choice for older Japanese and she came up with the idea to broaden their appeal to the young . It won't protect your phone, but it could save your life: The Senbei Survival iPhone case is intended to be eaten in an emergency, such as during a large scale natural disaster . However, before you reach for your credit card, Mariko warns customers that the case is immensely fragile and she cannot guarantee the case will reach them in one piece.

"A four-year-old little boy rescued a three-year-old girl from drowning by pushing her up above the water in the deep end of a Fort Worth, Texas, pool on August 6. But the daring rescue proved to be too much for Xander Vento, who became tired and sunk down to the bottom of the Woodland Springs development pool.

Tragedy: The daring rescue proved to be too much for Xander Vento, who became tired and sunk down to the bottom of the Woodland Springs development pool . A MedStar spokesman told KHOU that Xander had rushed to help a three-year-old girl who was struggling in the deep end. Xander supported the girl above the water until she could get to safety, but he slipped under after he became exhausted. The girl was found to be in fair condition. Paramedics that reached Xander at the bottom of the pool said he lapsed into a coma shortly after. He was rushed to Cook Children's Medical Center where he was put on life support. His mother was at the pool during the incident, though it is unclear if there was a lifeguard on duty. Three days later, his parents Misty and Cris Vento decided to take him off. 'We have made the extremely difficult decision to remove our precious son Xander from life support,' they said in a statement.

"Sandra Herold, the deceased owner of Travis the chimp that mauled her friend and assistant Charla Nash's face, spoke openly and honestly about the bizarre world she and her animal lived in before the horrific attack. Speaking to her attorney in sworn testimony, Mrs Herold told of how she and Travis would sleep together 'every night' and she would have Miss Nash purchase specially sized sweet potatoes for his enjoyment. She also insisted that then Stamford Mayor Daniel Malloy, who is now governor of Connecticut, casually told her to 'not let him out again' after he escaped during 2003 and terrorized the downtown area. On Feb. 16, 2009, the 200-pound . chimpanzee mauled Miss Nash, causing her to lose her eyesight, lips, . nose, and hands in the attack. A hearing for Miss Nash's $150million lawsuit against the state will be held today to see if her claim that the state failed to protect the public, including herself, from a dangerous animal. Recovery: Charla Nash has settled an undisclosed lawsuit against the animal's now-dead owner after her face was ripped off . Attack: On Feb. 16, 2009, the 200-pound chimpanzee named Travis, left, mauled Charla Nash, right, causing her to lose her eyesight, lips, nose, and hands in the attack . She received a face transplant after the attack and now lives in a rehab center outside Boston, while Mrs Herold passed away from a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 72. Miss Nash has already filed a $50 million lawsuit against Mrs Herold's estate, but she is hoping that Mr Malloy's conversation with Mrs Herold, which he denies, will prove he was aware of the dangers of the animal's continued freedom. In newly released transcripts published in the Hartford Courant, Mrs Herold told her attorney that Travis escaped from her SUV in October 2003. Vacation: Sandra Herold, the deceased owner of Travis, spoke openly and honestly about the bizarre world she and her animal lived in before the horrific attack . Happy: Miss Nash, pictured here with Travis, worked for Mrs Herold performing odd jobs and caring for the animal . The animal eluded police capture and proceeded to romp all over cars in the downtown Stamford street before buckling himself back into the seat of her car. 'And when did you have this contact with Mayor Malloy?' her attorney asked. 'We used to take Travis for a ride every night and a lot of times went by his home,' Mrs Herold responded. 'And you had a conversation with him?' her attorney asked. 'A good conversation. You know, just friends. And we would stop. And he just said, ""San, do me a favor? Don't let him get out again,""' she replied. Reconstruction: In the attack, her eyes, nose, and lips were mauled off . Courageous: The survivor first revealed her mauled face on the Oprah Winfrey show; before the surgery, she kept a veil over her face . The Mayor has repeatedly denied that he ever had any conversations with Miss Herold about the animal. Miss Nash has also claimed that he knew about the 2003 rampage and did nothing. '[He] allowed her to take Travis home and said [to] keep him locked up. I think it was said that if he got loose again, they were going to shoot him. That's what Sandra told me,' Miss Nash said in March. But beyond the testimony about Mr Malloy, Mrs Herold gave more details about her life with the chimp that dined on lobster and steak and drank from wine glasses. 'I didn't consider him a pet, really,' she declared. Court: Charla Nash, right, talks with attorney Bill Monaco before a hearing at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford, Connecticut . Injury: Charla Nash arrives for a hearing at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford, Connecticut . 'Okay. Well, what did you consider him?' her attorney asked. 'Part of the family,' she responded. She also told her attorney that the chimp would sleep in bed with her every night. The animal was shot dead by police during his vicious attack. If Miss Nash's request to sue the state is . denied by the Claims Commission, she can appeal to the legislature. Nash's lawyers have hired a lobbyist to represent her if necessary at . the state Capitol. The state has 'sovereign immunity' against most lawsuits unless such permission is granted. Despite her legal woes, the face transplant recipient says she feels at home in her new skin. 'I have to depend on a lot of help. My life depends on really not being alone. I used to be very independent.' Charla Nash . The brave 58-year-old woman, who nearly died in the horrific mauling, told the Hartford Courant that she feels no different than she did before the attack. ‘I just feel like it’s my face,’ she said. ‘It’s just not working real good.’ Ms Nash, a single mother from . Stamford, Connecticut, told the Courant that she’s regaining movements . in her face and can express herself with various motions. ‘Every day, my muscles get better,’ she said. Sandra . Herold, who owned the 200-lb chimp Travis, died of an aneurism in 2010. Ms Nash said that if she could say anything to her former boss and . friend, she would say she is ‘sorry that all this happened. And, nothing . we can change now.’ She also said that Mrs Herold was a troubled woman, who cared more about the animal than her good friend. On a rampage: Travis escaped in 2003 and roamed around Stamford, Connecticut before he was eventually re-captured . Q: ‘So, is it your testimony that from the time you first purchased . Travis [in 1995, when he was born] and brought him home to Stamford . until your husband died [in 2004] you would bring Travis to Desire Me . Motors daily?’ A: ‘Every single day.’ Q: ‘...You mean Monday through Sunday every week?’ A: ‘...If I was down there Monday through Friday, he was with me Monday . through Friday. If we went down on Saturday, he was down on Saturday. When I was there, he was there. And everybody in town knew it.’ Q: ‘And when you first brought Travis home to Stamford did he have a bedroom?’ A: ‘Ours.’ Q: ‘Okay. So he stayed in the same room with you and your husband?’ A: ‘Slept in the same bed from the day he was brought home until the day . he died.’ Q: ‘So, he would sleep in that bed every night with you — ‘ . A: ‘Every single night.’ Q: ‘ — and your husband?’ A: ‘Yes.’ Q: ‘And after your husband died he would sleep with just you?’ A: ‘Yes.’ Mrs Herold also spoke of her employment of Miss Nash, saying she paid her $300 a week in cash. Q: ‘Okay. And what was her job?’ A: ‘Answer the phones, release the [towed] cars, clean out the cars when . they were going to junk after they had been totaled. Just general. Shop . for Travis, mow the lawn up at the house, clean his pen, get newspapers . for him. ... There was a [newspaper distribution] place right around . the corner from us. You know, papers they didn't sell. And you had to be . there by 6 in the morning, between 5:30 and 6. And twice a month — once . for sure, but most of the time it was twice a month.’ Q: ‘And the newspapers were for what purpose?’ A: ‘Travis's room. Because originally it had a tile floor, and then I . put rubber matting over it. And then I put the papers over that.’ Mrs Herold was also asked how Miss Nash would shop for Travis. A: ‘ ... I would take her to the store … and I'd say, 'Okay. He likes . sweet potatoes. They have to be this size.' You know, he liked not great . big ones, not little tiny ones. They had to be a certain size. So, I . showed her. And then fruit, he liked a certain kind of bananas and . stuff. So, if I couldn't go, she had to go.’ Q: ‘Okay.’ A: ‘And she'd make him rice pudding. And you know, she was bottle . picking, so she found toys that people put out that were good. She'd get . it for him. Stuff like that.’","Charla Nash, 58, horrifically mauled by chimpanzee in 2009 .

"Off the hook: Since the law changed last year, 43 applications for removal from the Sex Offenders' Register have been approved . Police have secretly removed dozens of convicted sex offenders, including paedophiles and rapists, from the Sex Offenders’ Register, the Mail can reveal. Following a human rights ruling, the law was changed last year to allow sex attackers to claim they no longer posed a threat and apply to be taken off the register. Since then, 43 applications have been approved behind closed doors, at the rate of one every five days. About half of those who apply have been successful – including eight rapists and 27 child sex attackers. Each case was signed off by a . mid-ranking police officer following a paper review of the case. With . the stroke of a pen, each convict was removed from the list, and is now . free to walk the streets with no monitoring of any kind. Those . who are taken off the register no longer have to tell the police where . they are living, even if they move near a school, or move in with a . family with young children. Nor do they have to tell the police about . any overseas travel. Forces . are refusing to name those taken off the register, citing Article 8 of . the Human Rights Act – the right to a private and family life – and data . protection rules. And they say it would ‘compromise the health and . safety of these individuals’ to name them. Some . are even refusing to give details of the offences committed, and . victims are not routinely notified if their attacker has been deemed no . longer a threat. Child protection charities said the use of the law was setting back child protection, and questioned whether sex offenders could ever be reformed. Claude Knights, director of children’s charity Kidscape, said: ‘This step removes a number of bricks from the wall of child protection, and takes us back to the level of a number of years ago. ‘The jury is out on whether someone who has committed these crimes can ever be cured. The worry is someone could be let off the register and commit further crimes and harm more children.’ Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank, said: ‘The Sex Offenders’ Register exists to protect the public from people who risk committing serious crimes. 'These decisions involve a very . one-sided and backward understanding of human rights. It wrongly puts . the welfare of serious sex offenders above concern for public safety.’ The Mail used the Freedom of Information . Act to ask all 43 police forces in England and Wales how many sex . offenders they had removed from the list between September 1, when the . law came into force, and the end of March. Of the 27 who replied, there . have been 91 applications and 43 sex offenders taken off the register. One force, South Yorkshire Police, has approved all eight of its applications, including two rapists, one of whom attacked a child. Only one force, Norfolk, said it was contacting victims to tell them what was happening. Ministers were forced to allow the law change after a human rights ruling in 2010 which said it was a breach of criminals’ rights under Article 8 to keep them on the register without any chance of appeal. The case was brought by two convicted sex offenders. One, Angus Thompson, was jailed for five years for violently attacking and indecently assaulting a girl. He said the ‘stress’ of being kept indefinitely on the register had contributed to his ill health. The other was a man from Wigan who was 11 when he raped a boy of six. He said his name should be taken off because it prevented him from going on holiday. There are about 37,000 sex offenders on the register. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Sex offenders who remain a risk to the public will stay on the register, for life if necessary. ‘We argued strongly that sex offenders should stay on the register for life. But the Supreme Court decided they should be able to apply for a review of their case. ‘It is for individual police forces to decide how to manage known sex offenders living in the community, but those who pose a risk to the public will remain on the register.’","Sex attackers can be removed from register if they 'no longer pose a threat'

"Scientists have discovered evidence of 2,300-year-old surgical procedure on two ancient skulls. The skulls, unearthed in the Altai Mountains of Siberia, belonged to the Pazyryk nomadic tribe and showed clear signs of recovery after brain surgery. Using similar tools and techniques, scientists now plan to recreate the same, high-risk procedure - albeit on skulls of the dead. The skulls, unearthed in the Altai Mountains of Siberia, belonged to the Pazyryk nomadic tribe and showed clear signs of recovery after brain surgery. The skulls showed clear evidence of recovery after undergoing the process called 'trepanation'. It belonged to a man believed to be 40 to 45-years-old at the time of death . The skulls showed clear evidence of recovery after undergoing the process called 'trepanation', according to a report in the Siberian Times. Trepanation was a risky ancient medical procedure which involved drilling a hole, or surgically scraping into a human skull. It was used, among other things, to relieve brain swelling, and historians believe it may also have been mistakenly used to treat problems with the nervous system. One of the skulls, which belonged to a man aged 40 to 45, showed signs of suffering a trauma to the head. Scientists believe he developed a subdural haematoma, a condition where blood forms between the skull and the surface of the brain. 30-year-old woman's skull from Kyzyk-Dzhar-IV shows that she died during the surgery or soon afterwards . The Pazyryk people were part of an Iron Age archaeological culture in the 6th to 3rd centuries BC. The Pazyryk archaeological culture belongs to the steppe archeological category, which is sometimes named ‘Scythian’. Their remains have been found in the Siberian permafrost in the Altay Mountains and nearby Mongolia. As well as their belongings, their bodies have preserved some of the best ancient tattoos ever seen in the world. They were believed to be skilled surgeons and had knowledge of the Hippocratic Corpus, a set of ancient Greek medical texts . The haematoma would have led to him suffering headaches, vomiting and movement problems in his right leg and hand. Trepanation would have removed the haematoma and evidence of later bone growth suggests the man lived for years after the surgery. The second male had a hereditary deformation, which was successfully improved with by drilling a hole into the skull. 'In the middle 19th century, the survival of patients after trepanation in the best hospitals in Europe rarely exceed 10 per cent,' Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences told Siberian Times. Trepanation was a high-risk ancient medical procedure which involved drilling a hole, or surgically scraping into a human skull. Pictured is the second male, who had a hereditary deformation of the skull . Scientists have now created computer models of the two skulls, along with a third skull found of a woman in which the procedure was unsuccessful . '[Trepanation] was associated with an extremely high risk of infectious complications, and this operation was committed only when patients had very severe traumatic brain injury.' 'Even today, with advanced neurosurgical techniques, successful implementation of trepanation requires the serious knowledge and training, and the procedure itself is not considered as absolutely harmless.' Archaeologists believe the Pazyryk tribe may have had knowledge of the Hippocratic Corpus, a set of ancient Greek medical texts associated with the physician Hippocrates. They claim results of the ancient operations on these two skulls to be 'astonishing' given the risks associated with such surgery. Scientists have now created computer models of the two skulls, along with a third skull found of a woman in which the procedure was unsuccessful. The 30-year-old woman's skull indicated injury consistent with a fall, and further analysis suggests she died during the surgery or soon afterwards. By recreating the procedure, scientists at the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography hope to understand more which tools were used, and why the procedure was carried out. 'It may have been related to the rituals through which man reached altered states of consciousness required for religious and magical activities,' they say. The Altai Mountains, where the skulls were found, are a mountain range in East-Central Asia, where Russia, China, Mongolia and Kazakhstan come together .","Skulls were found in Altai Mountains and belonged to Pazyryk tribe .

"An exotic tuna fish normally found in tropical seas off India and Sri Lanka has been caught in British waters for the first time. The 2ft skipjack was grabbed as it swam up the River Otter at the seaside town of Budleigh Salterton, Devon. Fisherman Leo Curtis took it home to barbeque and said: 'The taste was incredible - it was just like steak'. British first: Leo Curtis holding the tuna 2ft skipjack tuna caught at the mouth of the River Otter near Budleigh Salterton in Devon . Skipjack tuna are usually found in tropical seas but experts say the fish could have been attracted to Britain's coastline due to rising water temperatures. There are no records of one ever being caught in UK waters. Leo Curtis and friend Ian Carrott had been fishing on the beach when they spotted the 20lbs fish in six inches of water in the river estuary. They tried to direct it back out to sea but the exhausted fish died. Rather than leaving the tuna for seagulls to eat the pair gutted it and took it home to barbecue. Floundering: The exotic fish has been caught in British waters for the first time after it was discovered thrashing around in the shallows . Strange find: The tuna was caught here on the Devon coast, far from the tropical waters you'd expect to find it in . Leo, 37, an offshore diver, said: 'I was down on the beach doing a bit of spear fishing, something I do when the water is clear. 'I was just getting my wetsuit on by the mouth of the River Otter when I heard a noise that sounded like a dog splashing in water. 'Someone shouted that it was a salmon trying to swim up the river so I ran over and saw a big fish in about six inches of water. 'I saw straight away that it was a tuna. I knew it was a rare fish so we tried to turn it round and send it back out to sea but it just kept trying to swim back up the river. 'The fish was exhausted, it was clearly at the end of its life, and it died soon after. 'We did think about leaving it for the seagulls but it was just too nice a fish to waste. 'I gutted it on the beach and sliced a bit off straight away like sushi. The taste was incredible - it was just like steak. 'I cut off a chunk for a lady who had watched the whole thing then took the rest of the fish to a local fishmonger to put on ice. 'The next day I had family down for a barbecue so I cut the tuna into steaks and grilled them'. Fellow fisherman: Ian Carrott waves the tuna but instead of being kept for posterity it was put on the barbecue . Mike Heylin, chairman of the British Record Fish Committee, confirmed the skipjack tuna is the first to be caught in the UK. He said: 'There are no records of a skipjack tuna being caught in British waters so this is a first. 'I'm not surprised in the least though - every year we are seeing increasing numbers of what would be considered sub-equatorial fish in our waters. 'Skipjack are warm water fish but it is likely it arrived on one of the warm currents flowing north from the equator. 'Fish are very sensitive to changes in the weather and are often ahead of the game in terms of finding new areas of the oceans to explore. 'Successful species like skipjack are good at finding niche areas and doing very well out of them.' Skipjack tuna - Katsuwonus pelamis in Latin - are the smallest and most abundant of the major commercial tuna species. They are found mainly in the tropical areas of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. By night they swim near the surface but can dive up to 850ft during the day.","2ft skipjack was grabbed in the River Otter near Budleigh Salterton, Devon .

"It is a tourist explosion of a different kind. Scotland has taken more than half the places in a top travel guide's list of nine must-see extinct volcanoes in the UK. Wanderlust said that although the country does not have any active volcanoes, the landscapes they have sculpted are 'a sight to behold.' Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh and Ardnamurchan on the west coast were placed second and third, respectively, behind the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, which claimed top spot. Arthur's Seat is a long extinct volcano thought to have first erupted 350 million years ago and is the highest point in Edinburgh . The north-western corner of Ardnamurchan contains an underground volcanic complex that is 55 million years old . Castle Rock in Edinburgh is around 340 million years old, providing the land with a natural defence .

Cuillin, Isle of Skye . Of Arthur's Seat, Wanderlust said: 'A long extinct volcano thought to have first erupted 350 million years ago, it offers the best panoramic view over the city.' The north-western corner of Ardnamurchan, meanwhile, contains an underground volcanic complex that is 55 million years old. One of its only access points is a single track road - perfect for cyclists and walkers seeking some solace, according to the travel guide. 'There are hundreds of local, historical and guided walks around the region. The geo-trail along the peninsula is the best, where you can see the rocky cliffs formed by the area's first volcanic eruption. 'Mingary Castle sits atop two sheets of cooled, harden molten rock, while the abandoned village of Glendrian is situated within the volcanic amphitheatre, or 'ring-dykes'. The coast is also a home to many rare species such as wildcats, pine martens and golden and white-tailed eagles.' Castle Rock, Edinburgh, placed fifth. The guide said: 'Unlike the other volcanoes on this list, Castle Rock just happens to have a castle built on top of it (hence the name). The rock is around 340 million years old, providing the land with a natural defence and the castle itself defended by cliffs up to 80m high. 'The rock and its castle are another great attraction for a visit to Edinburgh. The castle is situated in the old town section of the city, surrounded by well-preserved Reformation-era architecture,' said Wanderlust. The beautiful and yet challenging Black Cuillin on the Isles of Skye will test even the experienced of climbers . Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland topped the list of nine volcanoes to see in the UK . Snowdonia predictably made the list, claiming fourth spot . Glen Coe made it in seventh place. 'What remains of this ancient super-volcano can be experienced by skiing, climbing, snowboarding, sledging, hiking and mountain biking, depending on the time of year you choose to visit. It's a landscape sculpted by volcanic eruption and glaciation,' said the guide. 'Most walkers take the Devil's Staircase across the hill to Kinlochleven, while the best routes for hillwalkers can be found in the mountain range of the Bidean nam Bian. Buachaille Etive Beag and Buachaille Etive Mor are also good sites, the latter of which is one of the areas' best spots for climbing. The Cheviot Hills in Northumberland were formed by volcanic lava flows, smoothed over by ice sheets moving across the region . The Borrowdale Volcanic Group in the Lake District secured sixth spot in the top nine volcanoes in the UK . The Aonach Eagach scramble also features two of Scotland's trickiest Munro hills: Sgorr nam Fiannaidh and Meall Dearg.' Making the list in ninth were the Cuillins on the Isle of Skye. 'The Black Cuillin, formed from volcanic rock, are individually great for scramblers, climbers and mountaineers. They are beautiful, but they are challenging. A full traverse of the ridge, despite only being seven miles long, is likely to take you 15-20 hours. It's not for the inexperienced, as the routes are very long and often very exposed. Hire a guide,' said Wanderlust.","Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh is highest-ranked Scottish volcano at second on the list .
It is only beaten by the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland .

"The resting place of Australia's first submarine may have been found off the coast of Papua New Guinea. HMAS AE1 was lost at sea in September 1914 along with its 34 crew members and last made contact off the coast of the Duke of York Island - an eastern island of the nation. Retired Rear Admiral Peter Briggs told news.com.au a wreckage resembling that of the missing submarine had been found close to where it had been seen before it disappeared near Rabaul. Scroll down for video . The resting place of Australia's first submarine may have been found off the coast of Papua New Guinea . Since the AE1 vanished, many searches have been mounted to find it but without any success, according to the Navy website. The most recent search was done in September with Navy Mine Hunter HMAS Yarra scouring the ocean floors near Mioko Harbour. On the last day of the hunt for the missing ship, the Yarra's sonar detector picked up a cylindrical shape but just before physical exploration could be conducted its equipment broke down. Admiral Briggs said the search crew on the Yarra were positive the find, Y1, was not a rock face jutting out from the ocean floor. The most recent search was done in September with Navy Mine Hunter HMAS Yarra scouring the ocean floors near Mioko Harbour . Y1 is more than 50 metres long, cuts a submarine-like figure and was found sitting upright in waters that were 170 metres deep, which would make further exploration easier as the area was shallow. The dimensions of the AE1 were 55.17 metres long, 6.86 metres in width and 6.86 metres high from its keel to the top of the coning tower. 'There are no known shipwrecks in the area where the sounding was made,' Admiral Briggs told News Corp. 'The object is likely something man-made due to its sonar signature. It is also located well away from Rabaul Harbour and its WW2 wrecks.' AE1 Incorporated is a not-for-profit organisation aiming at finding the lost submarine. The group's webmaster, James Palmer, told Daily Mail Australia they were trying to lobby the federal government for funding to conduct further searches, which could happen as early as next year. 'We're not 100 per cent certain it is the AE1... there needs to be more analysis done,' he said. 'But it is a great step forward... a really brilliant lead.' Mr Palmer said the upright position of the cylindrical object indicated if it had sunk almost immediately. 'It is thought she [AE1] was making her way home and struck unchartered reef... and it opened the side of her hull or keel and took on water very quickly,' he said.","HMAS AE1 was lost off the coast of Papua New Guinea in September 1914 .

"As the cities of America's Northeast pray for the merciful end to a terrible winter, they face another huge headache once the clouds finally part: historically horrendous potholes. In fact, pothole purgatory has already begun. In New York City, road crews have . patched a record 136,476 potholes since January 1. The Department of . Transportation had filled just under 57,000 by this same time in 2013. New . Englanders, famous for their meteorological stoicism, are reeling from . what Boston Public Works Commissioner Mike Dennehy calls a 'pothole . eruption.' More winter, more problems: PennDOT workers in Philadelphia have applied more than 2,000 tons of patching material in the five counties around the city, according to spokesman Gene Blaum . 'We filled our 6,000th pothole this morning since Jan. 1,' Dennehy said Tuesday. Last year's comparable figure was about 1,600. The . pace was even too much for the city's vaunted 'Potzilla' — a massive . truck that keeps the fill material hot en route to worksites. An . electrical failure last weekend caused the heating core and hydraulic . augers to quit, forcing workers to shovel up to 2 tons of dried asphalt . from the machine's bowels before the beast could hit the roads again, . Dennehy says. In Philadelphia, they're not even attempting to keep count. 'We're just trying to keep up as best we can,' says Gene Blaum, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Since . Dec. 1, PennDOT workers have applied more than 2,000 tons of patching . material in the five counties around the City of Brotherly Love, says . Blaum. 'It's been a relentless winter season,' he says. 'It's the recipe for potholes,' agrees Dennehy. 'It's just freeze-thaw-moisture, freeze-thaw-moisture, freeze-thaw-moisture. Not just the Northeast: A driver avoids a series of partially-patched potholes in the westbound lanes of the Jane Addams Tollway Monday near Huntley, Illinois Road crews across Illinois are working to fill potholes that have popped up on roads after the previous week's blast of winter weather . The Federal Highway Administration defines a pothole as 'Localized distress in an asphalt-surfaced pavement resulting from the breakup of the asphalt surface and possibly the asphalt base course.' Climate and traffic combine to remove pieces of asphalt, leaving potholes — and localized distress for drivers. Normally, major pothole trouble comes in late February or early March. But this season's 'polar vortex' meant cities from the upper Midwest to the Deep South have been repeatedly pummeled by ice and snow since January — and produced an early crater crop. Still, that wouldn't be as big a problem had the nation invested more up front, Galehouse and others say. In its report card on the nation's infrastructure last year, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave America's roads a D. In a recent post on the group's blog, contributor Becky Moylan quipped that 'pothole-dodging could be an Olympic sport.' But it's no laughing matter. ASCE estimates it would take an investment of $3.6 trillion by 2020 to ensure the safety of highways, bridges, the power grid and other public resources. Potzilla: Heavy motor technicians troubleshoot an electrical problem on a pothole repair truck dubbed Potzilla as even battle-tested Boston's winter armor starts to show cracks . Pot shot: New Englanders, famous for their meteorological stoicism, are reeling from what Boston Public Works Commissioner Mike Dennehy calls a pothole eruption this winter . American motorists are already paying the price: TRIP, a nonprofit organization that researches surface transportation issues, released a report last year estimating that 'unacceptably rough' roads cost the average urban driver $377 a year in repairs — or a total of $80 billion nationwide. Is anyone doing roads right? In an interview with the Guardian newspaper about the state of Great Britain's roads, David Weeks, director of that nation's Asphalt Industry Alliance, even gave props to the ancient rival across the Channel. 'This sort of thing doesn't happen in Scandinavia or France, where they mend the roads properly,' he said. Mats Wendel of the Swedish Transport Administration thinks America could learn something from his country, which he believes has stricter rules on asphalt composition and road construction than the U.S. to account for the wet and cold. He says additives such as cement and lime are compulsory in the top layer of asphalt on Swedish roads, and that there are even stricter limits on air bubbles within the asphalt. 'We take the frost in the ground into consideration when we construct our roads, and they don't really do that in the U.S.,' he says. 'We filled our 6,000th pothole this morning since Jan. 1,' Commissioner Mike Dennehy of Boston said this week . But he says Sweden has also borrowed a page from road builders in Arizona and California, who use rubber in the mix to avoid cracks. 'Some U.S. states use it to a great extent,' Wendel says. 'But not on the East Coast.' In fairness, Thomas Bennert, a research professor at Rutgers University's Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation, says it's hard to compare Stockholm with New York. 'You can go to parts of Scandinavia where I'm sure they don't have to really do anything, because the roads are not really traveled as heavily,' he says. 'You do need that pounding of the traffic to really hit it.' Regardless of what they're doing elsewhere, what really matters is what's happening right here at home, says Galehouse. He says Americans pay about $21 a month on average in state and federal road taxes — a fraction of what they pay for cable television or a cell phone. 'And yet what is one of our most expensive investments out there?' he says. 'It's our automobile. And we're wrecking our automobiles because we're hitting potholes ... The key is not fixing them. The key is preventing them.' But the patching goes on. Boston has 'Potzilla.' Others are investing in so-called 'pothole killer' machines, says Haas. 'A person right from the cab of the vehicle can blow highly compressed air to get all the water and debris out of a pothole,' he marvels. 'It unloads its asphalt and aggregate mixture down into there, and then it compacts it — all in one breath. And it just moves on to the next pothole.' Trouble down south: This combination of Feb. 12, 2014 and June 9, 1965 photos shows highway I-85 going into Atlanta with the Georgia State Capitol in the background. An American Society of Civil Engineers estimate says it would take an investment of $3.6 trillion by 2020 to ensure the safety of highways, bridges, the power grid and other public resources . Still, much work being done this hectic season has been what those in the industry call 'throw-and-roll' — slap some 'cold mix' of stone and liquid asphalt into the hole, roll over it with the truck, and move on. Researchers at Nottingham Trent University and the University of Nottingham in England found that applying a coat of bitumen emulsion between two layers of asphalt 'greatly improved its resistance to further cracks.' They also confirmed that a hot mix repair — in which the asphalt was heated to 284 degrees or higher — was the best option for fixing holes 1 inch and deeper. If 'a few simple and cost-effective measures are applied with each repair then there may be less need for as many repeat repairs,' and savings could be in the millions annually, Mujib Rahman, one of the study's co-authors, said in a university release last February. All of this is cold comfort for American drivers. Robert Sinclair, a spokesman for the American Automobile Association in New York, says his branch received more than 13,000 calls for flat tires in January, a 25 percent increase over last year. 'Just about all flat tire calls are potholes,' he says. Manhattan's streets are such a minefield that rolling over a hole is often the lesser of two evils, says New York cabbie Ishtiaq Mealow. 'They're deep and everywhere,' says the 20-year-old driver, whose cab suffered a blowout Tuesday. 'But sometimes in New York City, you can't avoid them. There's too much traffic coming ... You just got to take a risk.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ice cracked roads pose a new headache once the brutal winter finally ends .

"At a staggering 16ft long, it's little wonder that this crocodile needs a substantial meal to satisfy him when he's hungry. But as these stunning pictures show, even a whole pigs head isn't too much for this giant beast to stomach. The saltwater crocodile, whose name translates to Too Long in English, was snapped during feeding time at a crocodile park in Pasay City, Manila. The hungry reptile feasted on the pig's head which weighed in at 6.5kg. Hungry: A salt water crocodile called 'Too Long' holds a 6.5 kg pig head in its mouth during feeding time inside a crocodile park in Pasay city, Manila . The meaty meal was hardly an unusually large feast for a saltwater croc, with the species known to eat whatever they can clamp their jaws around. The fierce predators have been known to eat anything from water buffalo, monkeys, wild boar and even sharks. The species, which is native to saltwater areas of eastern India, south east Asia and northern Australia, is even said by some to be the animal most likely to eat a human. Saltwater crocodiles lurk just beneath the surface of the water and pounce without warning. Ferocious: The giant reptile catches the pig's head in its powerful jaw. Too Long is the largest saltwater crocodile at the park in Manila . They tend to use their tails and powerful jaw to spring from the water, grab their prey and drag them beneath the surface. The creature then holds its victim under the water until it drowns. Saltwater crocodiles can live for up to 70 years and grow to an average of 17ft, weighing around 1,000lbs. But 23ft long crocodiles are not unheard of. An official at the crocodile park in Manila, where Too Long is kept, said that he is the largest species at the park.

"The mother of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects ranted that her sons were being framed for the terrorist attack, describing the scene of carnage as a 'really big play' with 'paint instead of blood'. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva was on the verge of hysteria when she told a press conference on Thursday  that she does not accept that her sons carried out the attacks in Boston on April 15 which left three people dead and 264 injured. She gestured wildly, making a gesture of her hands being cuffed, as she sat alongside her husband Anzor. She said that she regretted living in the U.S. Tsarnaeva added: 'America took my kids away from me. I’m sure my kids were not involved in anything.' Scroll down for video . Defiant: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, the mother of the two Boston bombing suspects, speaks at a news conference as the suspects' father, Anzor Tsarnaev listens in Makhachkala . Emotional: Anzor Tsarnaev (left) and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, parents of Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - the two men suspected of carrying out the Boston bombings - take part in a news conference on Thursday . Hysteria: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, the mother of the two Boston bombing suspects, speaks at a news conference as her sister-in-law, Mayam, looks on . Staying put: Anzor Tsarnaev says he is postponing a trip to the United States because of poor health . Tsarnaeva earlier told CNN that she believed that the Boston marathon atrocity was a 'really big play' with 'paint instead of blood'. The father of the suspected bombers Anzor Tsarnaev told the same press conference that he would travel from Russia to the United States to bury his elder son. The parents sat side by side in the southern Russian city of Makhachkala and denied their sons had planted the bombs at the Boston marathon, saying they had been framed. Their other son Dzhokhar, . 19, remains under police guard in a Boston hospital and is facing . terrorism charges which could result in the death penalty. Banging the table in front of him, Anzor said: 'I am going to the United States. I want to say that I am going there to see my son, to bury the older one. 'I don't have any bad intentions. I don't plan to blow up anything. Enraged: Anzor Tsarnaev and his wife Zubeidat gesture at the gathered journalists at the press conference alongside the bombing suspects' aunt Patimat Suleymanova . Wild claims: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, mother of Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, (pictured at a press conference on Thursday) claims that the Boston Marathon bombings were one big play with 'paint instead of blood' 'I am not angry at anyone. I want to go find out the truth,' said Anzor, who took off his sunglasses only when photographers asked him to. He said he would go as soon as possible but that he had not yet bought a plane ticket. Tsarnaeva said she was still thinking over whether to travel to the U.S. Her hesitation to travel may be based on the fact that she was charged with shoplifting last . summer and is concerned that she could be arrested. However Tsarnaeva . said that she had been assured by lawyers that she would not be. The Tsarnaev family emigrated to the U.S. a decade ago, but both parents returned to Russia last year. Zubeidat also described a figure known only as 'Misha' - who has been pinpointed as a source of radicalization for her son Tamerlan. She said that he was a 'very nice man', of Armenian origin and living in Boston. 'Misha' is also apparently a convert to the Islamic faith. Suspects: Dzhokhar, right, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev are accused of planting the Boston bombs at the historic race on April 15 . It is almost a week since the Boston bombers' reign of terror came to an end. The suspects' father . has already been interviewed by Russian and American authorities - and . will face further interviews when he arrives in the U.S. Speaking out on Wednesday, Mrs Tsarnaeva launched into a bizarre rant in . which she claims she does not care if she or her youngest son are killed . by U.S. authorities. Their eldest son, Tamerlan, 26, died . after a shootout with police in Watertown, Massachusetts last  Friday, . while her youngest, Dzhokhar, 19, is in hospital recovering from a bullet wound . to the neck. 'If they are going to kill him, I don't . care,' she told CNN of Dzhokhar. 'My oldest one is killed, so I don't care. I don't care is my . youngest one is going to be killed today. I want the world to hear this. And I don't care if I am going to get killed too. And I will say . Allahu akbar!' While Dzhokhar . was reportedly injured from a self-inflicted gun shot wound as he . sought to hide from police in a boat parked in a backyard, his mother . said she does not believe this account. 'You know what I think? I think now they . will try to make my Dzhokhar guilty because they took away his voice, . his ability to talk to the world... They did not want the truth to come . out.' She added that . the only reason her sons were targeted was because they were Muslim, . adding that she saw footage of Tamerlan being killed 'really cruelly.' U.S. authorities are on their way to speak with Zubeidat Tsarnaeva in the aftermath of the bombings. Busted: Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, was arrested last year after she allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothing from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store . ABC News reported on Tuesday that Mrs Tsarnaeva failed to show up at a court hearing stemming from a July 2012 arrest. If she returns to the U.S. to visit her hospitalized son or make burial arrangements for the other, she . could be arrested on an outstanding warrant. Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothes from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store. She was charged with two . counts of malicious/wanton damage and defacement to property after . allegedly swiping the merchandise from the retailer's Natick, . Massachusetts location in June 2012. She was due in court on October 25 for a hearing in the case, but never showed up. The Lord & Taylor location is . not the same as the one on Boyleston Street in Boston, where a . surveillance camera captured what police say is her younger son . dropping a pressure cooker bomb that was hidden inside a backpack. The family's lawyer Heda Saratova, asked for the family to be left alone and said that the parents had just seen . pictures of the body of their elder son and were not up to . speaking with anyone. Questioning: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, mother of Boston bombing suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar, leaves her home for the first time on Tuesday in Dagestan with an unidentified man . Grief: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is pictured outside her home in Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim province in Russia's Caucasus . 'The mother is in very bad shape,' Saratova said. 'She watches the video and cries.' The images, taken by a resident of Watertown, Massachusetts and posted on his blog, appear to show the Tsarnaev . brothers sheltering behind a vehicle and taking aim at police . officers. They are reportedly seen running to a car for more supplies before . hauling out a pressure cooker bomb they then detonated, filling the . street with smoke. The photographs, taken on the . eyewitness' phone from a third-floor bedroom overlooking the . scene, are the first images giving insight into the fraught battle that . left one brother dead. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev then jumped in the car . and barreled towards the police barricade, making a narrow escape. Authorities said that he ran over his brother Tamerlan. Their mother told Channel 4 on Tuesday that her sons had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks. She said: 'What happened is a terrible thing but I know my kids have nothing to do with this. I know it, I am mother.' She added to CNN that she had spoken . to Tamerlan after the bombings and he told her he missed her and loved . her, and she said her 'loving' son even inquired about the cat. The trip by the U.S. team was made . possible because of Russian government cooperation with the FBI . investigation into the bombing at the Boston Marathon. Also on Tuesday, the bombers' sister, . Ailena and Bella Tsarnaev, released a statement to the media, saying . that they 'don't have the answers' about their brothers' alleged crimes. Battle: The eyewitness said the men ran to the green sedan, left, for more supplies such as explosives . Threat: In another image, a red circle shows what the eyewitness believed to be a pressure cooker bomb . Taken down: Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gunfight with police on April 19. Dzhokhar, who was injured, was captured that evening . The statement read: 'Our heart goes . out the victims of last week's bombing. It saddens us to see so many . innocent people hurt after such a callous act. 'As a family, we are absolutely devastated by the sense of loss and sorrow this has caused. 'We . don't have any answers but we look forward to a thorough investigation . and hope to learn more. We ask the media to respect our privacy during . this difficult time.' The mother is from Dagestan, while the suspects' father is from neighboring Chechnya. Their . sons had spent little time in either place before the family moved to . the U.S. a decade ago, but the elder son was in Russia for six months . last year. Shielded: Katherine Russell, the widow of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, leaves her lawyer's office on Tuesday . The father of the two Boston bombing suspects will apparently travel to the U.S. later this week in order to seek 'justice and the truth'.

"Luis Suarez believes he will leave Liverpool this summer in a £65million move to Real Madrid – though Barcelona have now also entered the race to sign him. The Liverpool striker, whose two goals effectively finished off England’s World Cup campaign on Thursday in Sao Paulo, has told friends that there is a £65million release clause in his contract and that he is confident of joining Madrid, who have indicated they will make an offer to Liverpool. However, the situation has now been complicated by Barcelona’s interest, given that the family of his wife, Sofia, lives near the city in the suburb of Castelldefels.

"It might look like a quirky plastic model of an ancient Egyptian pyramid, but this model is in fact a 3D 'acoustic cloak', created using just a few perforated sheets of plastic. The device reroutes sound waves to create the impression that both the cloak and anything beneath it are not there. A refined version of the technology could one day be used for sonar avoidance and to refine noise in concert halls. The 'invisible' pyramid: The world's first 3D acoustic cloak (pictured) was created by U.S. engineers using just a few perforates sheets of plastic and a great deal of number crunching. The device reroutes sound waves to create the impression that both the cloak and anything beneath it are not there . The engineers used metamaterials - a combination of materials with special light-scattering qualities; in this case in repeating patterns - to achieve unnatural properties. The pyramid is constructed using plastic plates with a repeating pattern of holes that are stacked on top of one another. Its design means that sound waves can be manipulated by plastic and air. The cloak alters the sound waves’ trajectory to match what they would look like had they had reflected off a flat surface. Because the sound waves are not . penetrating the pyramid, they are travelling a shorter distance, which . in turn affects the wave's speed. The device then reroutes these slower . sound waves to create the impression that both the cloak and anything . beneath it are not there. Engineers from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, claim that unlike other efforts, the acoustic cloaking device works in all three dimensions, no matter which direction the sound is coming from. ‘The particular trick we’re performing is hiding an object from sound waves,’ said Steven Cummer, professor of electrical and computer engineering. ‘By placing this cloak around an object, the sound waves behave like there is nothing more than a flat surface in their path,’ he explained. To achieve the effect, Professor Cummer and his colleagues used metamaterials, which are materials with light-scattering properties. His device uses a combination of materials in repeating patterns to achieve unnatural properties, according to the study which is published in the journal Nature Materials. Engineers from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina such as Bogdan Popa who is pictured with the pyramid, claim that unlike other efforts, the acoustic cloaking device works in all three dimensions, no matter which direction the sound is coming from . The materials manipulating the behaviour of sound waves in the plastic pyramid, which is constructed using plastic plates with a repeating pattern of holes that are stacked on top of one another, are simply plastic and air. The cloak alters the sound waves’ trajectory to match what they would look like had they had reflected off a flat surface. Because the sound waves are not penetrating the pyramid, they are travelling a shorter distance, which in turn affects the wave's speed. The device then reroutes these slower . sound waves to create the impression that both the cloak and anything . beneath it are not there. ‘The structure that we built might look really simple,’ said Professor Cummer, ‘but I promise you that it’s a lot more difficult and interesting than it looks. ‘We put a lot of energy into calculating how sound waves would interact with it. We didn’t come up with this overnight,’ he said. To test the cloaking device, the researchers covered a small sphere with the cloak and ‘pinged’ it with short bursts of sound from various angles. The scientists conducted their tests in the air, but sound waves behave similarly underwater, so the device could one day be used for sonar avoidance. Sonar is used by the military to find objects underwater (pictured) and cloaking devices are expected to revolutionise surveillance and warfare . Using a microphone, they mapped how the waves responded and produced videos of them traveling through the air. Professor Cummer and his team then compared the videos to those created with both an unobstructed flat surface and an uncloaked sphere blocking the way. The results clearly show that the cloaking device makes it appear as though the sound waves reflected off an ‘empty’ surface. Although the experiment is a simple demonstration showing that the technology is possible, concealing an evil genius’ underwater lair is a long ways away, according to Professor Cummer. However, he believes that the technique has several potential commercial applications. ‘We conducted our tests in the air, but sound waves behave similarly underwater, so one obvious potential use is sonar avoidance,’ he said. ‘But there’s also the design of auditoriums or concert halls - any space where you need to control the acoustics. If you had to put a beam somewhere for structural reasons that was going to mess up the sound, perhaps you could fix the acoustics by cloaking it.’ The centre of the acoustic circulator, pictured, is fitted with three specially positioned fans that change the flow of air through the separate chambers . Spies around the world could soon be able to listen in on secret conversations without any fear of being found out thanks to the first ever one-way sound machine. Sound waves traditionally travel forward before bouncing back, and with sound this means you can speak, hear yourself speak, and hear any responses. An 'acoustic circulator'  which is the first of its kind, uses fans to change the flow of air as sound waves travel through it and this prevents the waves from bouncing back. The circulator was created by a team of researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin led by Professor Andrea Alu. Professor Alu said his experiments successfully prove that the 'fundamental symmetry with which acoustic waves travel through air between two points in space - for example, if you can hear, you can also be heard - can be broken by a compact and simple device'. The inspiration for the device came from current three-port electronic circulators that are typically used in communication devices and radars. For example, Microwaves and radio signals are able to move from one port to the next in sequence, meaning they're never sent back to the recipient. In these electronic circulators, when one of the ports isn’t being used, the system acts as an isolator, letting signals to flow from one port to the other, but not back. The UT Austin team realised the same principles could apply from sound waves traveling in air, which led to the team's building of a first-of-its-kind three-port acoustic circulator. 'Using the proposed concept, we were able to create one-way communication for sound traveling through air,' Professor Alu said.","Engineers from Duke University in North Carolina, claim the acoustic cloaking device works no matter which direction the sound is coming from .

"The controversial Liverpool Care Pathway is to stay in use in hospitals – but its name may change. Complaints by hundreds of families to the Health Service Ombudsman have failed to persuade an official inquiry to ban the Pathway, which is meant to ease the last hours of the dying. Families say elderly patients have died unnecessarily and before their time because of the LCP, according to evidence the watchdog revealed today. The controversial Liverpool Care Pathway is to stay in use in hospitals but it will be renamed and have new rules and guidelines . They also say patients whose condition worsened because of poor hospital treatment have then been killed off after being put on the Pathway. The watchdog has heard allegations that even when the LCP has been properly applied, it has failed to provide the terminally ill with either pain relief or dignity and respect. The fast-rising numbers of complaints made to the NHS Ombudsman have been detailed in a paper given to the official inquiry into the LCP. However the inquiry, ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and headed by Baroness Neuberger, is understood to have pushed aside evidence of public disquiet in its findings, to be published later this month. Instead it is due to give hospitals the green light to continue using the Pathway under a new set of rules and guidelines. The inquiry is expected to try to restore the Pathway’s reputation by ending bribes to hospitals. It will call for a halt to the distribution of millions of pounds by NHS trusts to hospitals that hit targets for numbers of patients who die while on it. The inquiry that was ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is understood to have pushed aside evidence of public disquiet in its findings, to be published later this month . Lady Neuberger will also recommend that families must be kept informed by doctors and nurses, and she may call for the tainted name Liverpool Care Pathway to be changed in an attempt to reassure families. A name change has been backed by Mr Hunt. The Pathway, which has come into use in most hospitals over the past five years, is meant for when medical staff decide patients are in their last hours of life. Typically it involves heavy sedation and the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, including tubes providing fluids and nutrition. On average, a patient dies 33 hours after being put on the Pathway. Mr Hunt ordered the inquiry late last year after protests from senior medical figures and following allegations made to the Daily Mail by families of patients. The report to Lady Neuberger by the Health Service Ombudsman said that since 2010 nearly 500 complaints about NHS end of life care have been made to the watchdog. The report by Baroness Julia Neuberger said that since 2010 nearly 500 complaints about NHS end of life care have been made to the watchdog . The scale and persistence of complaints to the Ombudsman – 152 in the year to March 2012 and 186 in the following 12 months – undermine the claims of Pathway supporters that its poor reputation is a result of media ‘hysteria’. The Ombudsman paper said in some cases relatives raise concerns about patients being put on the LCP ‘against the wishes of the patient and their family’. In such cases complainants often argue that the decision may have led to ‘an unnecessary or premature death’. Relatives also say that ‘they were unaware the patient was placed on the LCP, or that they were not given enough information to understand what this involved’. In a new criticism of the LCP, the paper also said many claimed it was failing in its central aim of giving the patient a dignified death.","The controversial Liverpool Care Pathway is to stay in use in hospitals .

Family portrait: In the shot, taken by award-winning photographer Jason Bell at a window of the Cambridges' home, Apartment 1A of Kensington Palace, Kate looks radiant in the fresh sunshine of spring. William looks more mature and George looks devoted to the cocker spaniel, Lupo . Meanwhile, his parents look naturally and . happily into the camera’s lens. What matters more, however, is that . they are letting the public gaze in. Never before has a Royal portrait beckoned to an audience with quite the same promise of effortless informality. In . the shot, taken by award-winning photographer Jason Bell at a window of . the Cambridges’ home, Apartment 1A of Kensington Palace, Kate looks . radiant in the fresh sunshine of spring. William appears more mature, . his boyish looks replaced by a new heft, reflecting perhaps both . fatherhood and his growing stature in the Royal tableau. Christening: The Duke of Cambridge holds three-month-old Prince George at Chapel Royal in St James's Palace. As he has grown, the young heir has developed an increasingly striking resemblance to other male members of the Royal Family . The . last time George was officially pictured, also by Bell, he was asleep . in a bouffant of creamy ruffles – the historic Honiton lace gown worn by . all Royal babies – at his christening last October. Prince George’s personalised jumper is believed to be a bespoke design, created especially for the young Royal. The . unique powder blue design is understood to have been machine made using . the finest 100 per cent cashmere yarn, much like the material favoured . by Royal favourite Johnstons of Elgin. The family-run woollen mill, which is based in Elgin, Scotland, currently holds the Royal Warrant for Prince Charles. There are however alternative options. Here, he is a . proper little boy with a fluff of brown hair, his mother’s dark eyebrows . and a very cool jumper which could make him a junior style icon. Think . back to Prince William at that age, clad in pastel romper suits and . lace-trimmed tops. Back then, William was dressed as a Royal baby, a . little Prince. George, as his cute pale blue woolly clearly says, is . just George. Cool modernity . with an undertow of nostalgia is the spirit of the picture. But it is . its unusual and rather daring technical details which make it the most . defining image of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge since their wedding . three years ago. The . washed-out tones seem designed to appeal simultaneously to two very . different generations. There’s probably not a family in the land which . does not have a similarly faded shot curling in the back of an old . photograph album, a picture of Mum and Dad back at the start of married . life. And there will not be a hipster twenty or thirty-something couple . who haven’t attempted to recreate that very shot for themselves using a . carefully chosen filter on Instagram. But . the message of the image itself is that the Cambridges are one happy, . confident family, keen to stay connected to the nation, while belonging . more than anything to each other.

"An eerie ghost cloud was seen forming high in Earth’s atmosphere by astronauts on board the International Space Station on Thursday. ‘Saw something launch into space today. Not sure what it was but the cloud it left behind was pretty amazing,’ tweeted Nasa astronaut Mike Hopkins. That same night YouTube videos revealed incredible footage of the same mysterious glow lighting up the clouds in Russia. Scroll down for video... The image was captured from the International Space Station by Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano. His colleague Mike Hopkins tweeted: 'Saw something launch into space today. Not sure what it was but the cloud it left behind was pretty amazing' Writing on the Above Top Secret forum, NBC News space analyst said: ‘Russia just test-fired a Topol ICBM from the Kapustin Yar range on the lower Volga, to the Shary Shagan impact zone in Kazakhstan. ‘In the past, such launches have been seen over a wide area, as far away as Israel and Syria, and reported as UFOs. ... If the weather was clear, we might expect some spectacular videos to show up on YouTube and RUTube.’ Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's picture from the International Space Station shows the trail left behind by a Russian missile launch . The Topol RS-12M missile is the latest addition to Russia’s military armoury. Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces carried out a successful test launch of a Topol/SS-25 missile on October 10, 2013. The missile was launched from Kapustin Yar to the Sary Shagan test site in Kazakhstan. Intercontinental ballistic missiles, such as this are used as nuclear weapon delivery systems, capable of delivering their payloads thousands of miles away. The 52 tonne missile has an operational range of 11,000 kilometers (6,800 miles). The missile plume seemed to have some shape and was composed of gas particles moving at around 10,000 feet per second, according to Oberg. While astronauts on the space station were able to see the rocket blast, experts claim it posed no threat to them. ‘This wasn't anywhere near a 'Gravity' Hollywood space debris cascade-triggering possibility,’ Oberg told NBC news. This isn’t the first time a missile launch has been mistaken for a UFO. Last year, thousands of people in .

However, the mysterious light was in fact another Russian missile test. The spirals of light in the sky were fuel spewing out from the missile as it burned in a fierce cartwheel through the sky, creating the startling geocentric shapes. In 2009, Norway’s northern town of Tromso was given a similar display. The Russian Defense Ministry admitted later this was a failed test of a Bulava intercontinental missile. This amazing, mysterious beam was spotted over Norway in December 2009: This was later confirmed as a Russian missile breaking up, with the light display made by the missile spinning as it flew into the atmosphere .","Sightings were made by astronauts in space and on the ground in Russia .

"The Christian leaders of a troop of Girl Guides are defying orders from their national HQ to scrap the old promise to ‘love my God’. A controversial decision was made in June to abandon allegiance to God, with the traditional pledge replaced with the words ‘be true to myself and develop my beliefs’. The new promise comes into effect from September 1. But last night it was revealed that a group of ‘rogue’ Girl Guide leaders have vowed that they will stick with the old promise and defy the line set by Girlguiding UK, the national body. The move has split the group – an atheist Girl Guide leader who recently joined has enlisted an atheist pressure group to fight on her behalf to adopt the new pledge. A decision was made in June to replace the allegiance to God with the words 'be true to myself and develop my beliefs' (file picture) Hazel Mitford, who runs the Guide troop, Brownie leader Jayne Morrison and Alison Ellison, who runs the Rainbows for younger girls, insisted the group, St Paul’s Girl Guides in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, should keep ‘God at its core’. In a letter to a local newspaper, they write: ‘The spiritual aspect is recognised in girlguiding and “God” has been part of the promise since it was founded. ‘You would not join the Lawn Tennis Association and insist they had to make provision for all other sports. Girlguiding has God at its core and anyone who has issue with this is free to start their own organisation.’ Jem Henderson, 28, joined her local Girl Guide troop as a volunteer leader in June after hearing about the secular promise. A mention of vowing to love or serve God has been included in the Promise since the Guides began in 1910. This picture shows a hail for the Queen from some of the 4,000 Girl Guides at the World Guide Camp in Windsor Great Park in August 1957 . She said: ‘The leader’s insistence on keeping the old promise excludes me and any atheist girls from the troop, or asks us to lie when making the promise, something that surely goes against the Guiding principles.’ The National Secular Society is taking action on her behalf, and has written to Girlguiding UK seeking clarification that all units will be required to use the new promise. A mention of vowing to love or serve God has been included in the Promise since the Guides began in 1910. Originally, new members were asked to ‘do my duty to God’, and this was changed to ‘love my God’ in 1994.","Decision made in June to abandon the old promise to 'love my God'

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger insists the FA Cup holders will not underestimate the potential of being on the end of an upset at Brighton on Sunday. The Gunners head to the Amex Stadium on the back of an impressive 2-0 win at Manchester City last weekend, which moved them closer to the Barclays Premier League top four. Wenger, though, will be taking nothing for granted against the Seagulls, who have regrouped under new manager Chris Hughton and defeated Sky Bet Championship promotion-chasers Ipswich 3-2 on Wednesday night with two goals from on-loan Liverpool forward Joao Teixeira. Olivier Giroud (top) and Alexis Sanchez have a play wrestle during Arsenal training . Top scorer Sanchez was in high spirits as he larked about with Mesut Ozil (left) and Giroud . Germany international Ozil (right), with youngster Dan Crowley, is expected to start against Brighton . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has vowed that the Gunners will be taking the FA clash seriously . Santi Cazorla and Hector Bellerin (right) were all smiles during a sunny day's training . 'We have to study them well,' Wenger said. 'In the cup, you have to be ready from the start and people like that can always surprise you if you are not ready.' Arsenal came through a fourth-round tie at Brighton in January 2013 with a late winner from Theo Walcott, but not before being pushed by Gus Poyet's well-organised team who were at the time themselves pressing for the Championship play-offs. 'It is always difficult in the Championship away from home,' said the Gunners boss. 'We remember Brighton from a couple of years ago, it was a very difficult game against a team who were on the way up - they were fighting at the top level with Gus Poyet. 'We needed to dig deep to get out with a positive result.' England international Theo Walcott is set for a return after recovering from a long-term injury . Keeper Wojciech Szczesny could also make a return after losing his place recently . In form Cazorla, pictured training with Aaron Ramsey, could be rested for the game . Ozil stretches out a boot as Cazorla (centre) and Sanchez watch on during the session at London Colney . Wenger is expected to rotate his squad on Sunday, which with several players now back from injury could see the likes of Walcott and Mesut Ozil start, having both been on the bench at Manchester City. Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny may also return having been out of the side since the Premier League defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day, after which the Poland international was reportedly smoking. Full-back Kieran Gibbs maintains having fought so hard to win the FA Cup last season, with an extra-time victory over Hull at Wembley in May ending the club's nine-year trophy drought, the Arsenal players are determined to enjoy another extended run in the competition. Reformed midfielder Francis Coquelin (left) turns up with Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny (right) Ozil is wrapped up warm despite the bright skies as he and Serge Gnabry (left) arrive for training . 'If you ask any of the players in our dressing room if they want to experience that again, they will all say yes,' Gibbs wrote in his blog on Sportlobster.com. 'They all want to keep hold of the FA Cup, so it will be another big test for us this weekend against a Brighton side which would love to cause an upset. 'We will prepare for the game exactly the same as we do for a big Premier League match and show our opponents full respect as ever. Hopefully, we will come through it okay.'","Arsenal face Brighton in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday .

"Perfect for tourists who have seen enough beaches or city landscapes, this floating hotel offers a room with a different kind of view: Ten feet beneath the surface of a Swedish lake. The Utter Inn offers guests a night to remember, with windows in every wall of the bedroom looking out into the water, teeming with fish. The ‘floatel’ is the brainchild of artist Mikael Genburg, known for his unique hotel experiences including one in a tree in a city centre park, and 'Ooops', the sunken villa which opened this summer not far from Utter Inn by Lake Malaren, Vasteras. Idyllic: The floating hotel is located in the middle of a Swedish lake east of Stockholm . Above surface: On top of the sundeck is a hut which is designed to resemble a traditional Swedish cottage and guests step inside to climb down to their bedroom . Utter Inn has an above-surface kitchen inside a little hut made to look like a traditional Swedish cottage. At bedtime guests climb down the hatch to their sleeping quarters which has an all-round view of life under the surface. Mr Genburg, who opened Utter Inn in 2000, said the idea came to him out of the blue and he was curious to see if it could work. He said: ‘I don't think there is an . experience quite like sleeping underwater and many people have come to . find out if they like it. Life in a goldfish bowl: Guests can look out into the lake from the bedroom . Interior: Despite the tough steel and glass exterior, the bedroom room has a homely feel with a hand-knitted Swedish rug on the wooden floor . ‘It's like a reverse aquarium - the fish like looking in at the guests and are fascinated by them. 'It's as if you're sat on your own island when you're on board - it's just an amazing experience.' After being taken out to the floating . hut by Utter Inn staff, visitors can relax on the deck or use the hotel’s . inflatable dinghy to explore one of the uninhabited islands in Lake . Malaren before a night underwater. The artist admitted that he had his doubts about the project when it first opened. 'I was quite worried as it was an unproven concept, but now I love it! 'Because there is a window on every side, you feel totally submerged in the lake.' Explore: In case the little hut gets too claustrophobic, guests can get in the inflatable dingy and take a trip around the lake . Small, but perfectly formed: Cross section shows the floating platform and living quarters above the water line, with a ladder going down into the bedroom, with two single beds . The Utter Inn is located in southern Sweden, just east of the capital Stockholm . Mikael said: ‘A lot of people who have visited have said they slept extremely well because of the rocking motion on board. ‘People with busy lives and . high-pressured jobs tend to visit, I think for the natural peace there . is in the very relaxing surroundings. ‘You can hear the lapping of the water outside of the windows as well which I think is a very therapeutic sound. ‘I always want to be by water - it's so soothing, romantic and calm - all at the same time.’ Goodnight: A nearby town brightens up the already light Swedish summer night as the guests at Utter Inn nip off to sleep with the fishes .","Windows on every wall look out into the lake, which is teeming with fish .

"Have you ever wanted to see the world through your partner’s eyes? That's the concept behind BeAnotherLab’s Gender Swap experiment that uses Oculus Rift headsets to let wearers experience how other people see the world. Each partner wears the head-mounted displays, and by synchronising their respective movements, they can virtually feel and see the other person’s body through their own eyes. Scroll down for video . Through the use of Oculus Rift headsets, and first-person cameras, the Gender Swap experiment creates a brain illusion that partner A can see what is being recorded by the visor worn by partner B, and vice versa, pictured. It was created by Barcelona-based artists BeAnotherLab . One member of the couple is called the user, while the other is the performer. Through the Oculus Rift goggles, the user is shown a video stream taken from the perspective of the performer's eyes. Each couple agrees on a set of synchronised movements and the partner's mirror each others hand gestures, and so on, while wearing the headsets. By mimicking movements, it creates an illusion in the brain that what the performer is seeing, is actually being seen through the eyes of the user. The user can move and interact with objects in a room, while listening to the performer's thoughts spoken through headphones. This generates the perception of . someone speaking inside their mind. The experiment uses BeAnotherLab's Machine To Be Another (MTBA) system. MTBA is an art installation developed with support from the Media lab Hangar and the Univeristat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona. It was set up at the L’estruch Cultural Center in Sabadell, Spain.

"The Duchess of Cambridge on her wedding day. The diet guru who helped . her get in shape for the occasion has been banned from practising . The diet guru who is said to have helped the Duchess of Cambridge fit into her wedding dress was today banned from practising as a GP for prescribing potentially lethal slimming pills. Pierre Dukan, the 71-year-old Frenchman, is said to have lied to his patients about the Mediator pill, which has been linked to hundreds of deaths. An eight day ban on working as a GP imposed by France's medical board is purely symbolic - Dukan voluntarily struck himself off the doctors' register last year. But it is a huge blow to the image of . a nutritionist whose protein-rich diet has earned him fame and fortune, . and dozens of celebrity clients. Sitting . in Paris, the medical board ruled that Dukan was guilty of a 'breach of . ethical regulations' for prescribing Mediator on five separate . occasions, and then lying about what he did. Dukan . was also ordered to pay the equivalent of £5,200 in damages to a former . patient who suffered heart difficulties in the 1970s after being told . to take Mediator, even though it was only intended to treat diabetes. The medical board ruled that Dukan had been dishonest, as he knew he was describing Mediator as a weight-loss pill. 'In . resorting to untruthful assertions, Dr Dukan displayed behaviour which . lacks probity and discredits the profession,' reads the medical board's . ruling. Dukan, who denies any wrong doing, said he would appeal today's ruling. Mediator, . which is thought to have caused up to 1,800 deaths in France alone, was . withdrawn from sale in 2009 after evidence emerged that it damaged . heart valves. Jacques . Servier, 90, the founder of the Servier biopharmaceutical company which . produced the drug, is due to go on trial in Nanterre, a suburb of Paris, . next year for 'aggravated fraud'. Servier is accused of concealing the harmful effects of the drug, which was never authorised for sale in the UK and USA. The . Dukan diet boasts a host of celebrity followers, including Jennifer . Lopez, supermodel Gisele Bundchen, and Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins. Both the Duchess of Cambridge and her mother, Carole Middleton, are also said to follow it to maintain their figures. Food . experts have, in turn, warned the regime is a 'health hazard' due to . its very low vegetable and carbohydrate intake, while the British . Dietetic Association voted it 'the worst celebrity diet of 2011'. Ban: Pierre Dukon is the creator of the highly popular Dukan Diet. However Food . experts have warned the regime is a 'health hazard' due to . its very low vegetable and carbohydrate intake . Last year, France's College of Physicians filed a complaint against Dukan for suggesting pupils should be awarded higher grades if they manage to keep slim. In a book out last year, he proposed creating a so-called 'ideal weight' option for A' level equivalent students in their final year exams, under which they would earn extra points for keeping slim. The French College of Physicians warned the proposal could prove harmful for pupils already suffering from obesity or anorexia.

"Travelers will now be allowed to bring golf clubs, ski poles and even small knives on planes with them since aviation officials have announced significant security changes. A number of previously-banned items will be allowed for the first time since the September 11 terrorism attacks, sparking outrage from flight attendants who said the decision would endanger passengers and crew. The TSA said effective April 25, it would allow small knives with blades that are 2.36 inches or less in length and less than 1/2 inch wide. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New rules: Flight attendants are balking at the new changes that will lift a number of prohibited items and allow travelers to carry on small knives on board . Remaining restrictions: TSA officials hope that by keeping some banned it will instill less fear in flyers . Should TSA lift their post-9/11 ban on small knives? Should TSA lift their post-9/11 ban on small knives? Now share your opinion . Other items that will be allowed on board again as part of a passenger's carry-on luggage include billiard cues, ski poles, hockey sticks and lacrosse sticks. Items that had been prohibited like razors, box cutters or knives with a fixed blade are still not allowed on board. The restrictions about liquids are still in place as well, meaning that anything under 3-ounces must be declared at the security checkpoint. TSA spokesman David Castelveter said the decision was made to bring U.S. regulations more in line with International Civil Aviation Organization standards and would also help provide a better experience for travelers. Specific: The TSA says that the changes reflect the findings of their recent review of security measures . Exemptions: Only certain bats are allowed but many think it is premature to allow any at all . The Association of Professional Flight attendants 'categorically rejects a proposal to allow knives of any kind in the cabin,' and they don't understand why 'such a momentous decision' was made without any consultation. As for some of the larger items that they will now allow, like the sports equipment, increases 'the potential for passengers getting hit with these items during boarding and deplaning. It's a recipe for disaster,' said the APFA representative. 'This is part of an overall Risk-Based . Security approach, which allows Transportation Security officers to . better focus their efforts on finding higher-threat items such as . explosives,' he said. The . Flight Attendants Union Coalition, which represents nearly 90,000 flight . attendants from carriers across the country, called the decision a . 'poor and shortsighted decision' by the TSA. Loosening the reins: TSA officials have changed their stance on certain banned objects which will now be allowed on planes starting on April 25 . No longer a threat? Billiard cues and lacrosse sticks will be allowed on board now . 'As the last line of defense in the cabin and key aviation partners, we believe that these proposed changes will further endanger the lives of all flight attendants and the passengers we work so hard to keep safe and secure,' the coalition said in a statement. Castelveter said the TSA has implemented a number of safety measures including reinforced cockpit doors, allowing some pilots to be armed and federal air marshals on board airplanes. He said those measures would help ensure safety of the passengers and crew. After the September 11, 2001 hijacking attacks, the U.S. government imposed a strict set of guidelines for what could be carried on board an aircraft - some of which differed from what other countries allowed passengers to carry on airplanes.

"An electrician was tasered by armed police because he walked into a shop with a screwdriver in his pocket. Chris Thomas, 45, had been repairing the lights in a nearby pub and still had the tool in his pocket which led to a security scare in central Swansea. He received four bursts of 50,000 volts from police officers after they challenged him in a Peacocks store in February last year. Workplace: Mr Thomas had been repairing broken lights at this pub in Swansea and forgot about the tools in his pocket . An armed response vehicle had been called after he had been spotted by security staff in BHS with the screwdriver protruding from his pocket, and then followed by city centre rangers. The case against Mr Thomas, who had been charged with a public order offence, was thrown out by magistrates, after an application by his representative. Grayson Tanner argued the evidence given to the court from five witnesses was inconsistent, and that officers had not followed correct procedures before they had brought him to the floor in the shop, and used the Taser. Magistrates were told Mr Thomas, an electrical engineer from Swansea, was a member of the Railwaymen's Club and had been mending lights on the premises as a favour. When he left to go into town, he forgot he still had two small screwdrivers in his pocket, and a small knife. The public order offence case against Chris Thomas was thrown out by magistrates at Swansea Magistrates Court . Three rangers were called to court and they described Mr Thomas, who had drunk several pints of cider, as walking in an ‘unsteady’ manner, but otherwise not acting suspiciously. However, some of their evidence was described as inconsistent, with one ranger telling magistrates that Mr Thomas had put his hands up when instructed by police, yet other witnesses did not give the same information. After the case was thrown out Chris Thomas said he was happy the long ordeal was over and called the case a ‘waste of money’. ‘I have a very supportive family and it's been difficult for them too, and I'm very grateful to them, as well as my bosses, who have given me the time to come to court. ‘It is a ridiculous waste of tax-payers' money to bring this to court. But I just want to move on now.’ Andrew Smith, prosecuting, said: ‘This was something of an unfortunate incident, when a man was arrested out of a misunderstanding.’","Armed police were called after Chris Thomas was spotted with a screwdriver .

"He sold his entire life – car, home, job and friends – on eBay, in search of the adventure of a lifetime. When Ian Usher's marriage broke up, he was determined to start afresh, travelling the world before settling down on his own Caribbean island. But five years after his life-changing decision, the 49-year-old is at it again- selling, in an online auction, his life in a tropical paradise. Scroll down for video tour of the island . A fresh start: After building his idyllic home on a beautiful island, the adventurous man is ready for another trip . For less than a price of a London home, you could be sitting on this jetty a world away from the average office job . For £160,000, ($250,000) less than half the price of the average London home, Mr Usher is offering his life on the private island, off the coast of Panama. The affordable opportunity is already listed on his website 'Caribbean Life 4 Sale'. Mr Usher, who is originally from Darlington, was devastated when wife Laura left him six years after they emigrated to Perth in Western Australia, . He made £192,000 from the sale of his three bedroom house in Perth, and all its contents, including a car, and a jet ski. Now Ian, who has re-married, plans to start a new life, after he quit his life in Perth to travel the world . Beats rainy England! The tropical setting could be yours for around £160,000 if you decide to follow in Ian's footsteps and jack in the day job . Ian Usher refused to let a devastating divorce get him down . With the proceeds he travelled the world, armed with nothing but a list of life-goals. For two years he lived life to the max, ticking off all but a handful of life experiences on a bucket list of 100. He met Richard Branson, acted in a Hollywood film and learned to fly a plane. He even found love, with a Canadian woman called Moe that he met on his travels, before buying and setting up home on the island near the border with Costa Rica. The complete Caribbean life comes with the wooden home he built from scratch, motor boats and dug out canoes for exploring the island. The house is solar-powered with rainwater collected on the roof and contains everything a prospective buyer would need in his new life. Exotic fruit grows on the island and fresh seafood arrives 'still flapping' by boat from other islands. Chicken roaming the mangroves provide free range eggs. The new owner will be able to take advantage of first class diving and snorkelling. Mr Usher says he has relished spending time there with his partner and her two children, but is now seeking a new challenge. He said: 'It's a beautiful place, but the traveller's itchy feet are starting to tickle again. 'I still have a long list of places I want to see, and I can't do that if I'm lounging in a hammock on the balcony sipping a margarita. The Caribbean island home that is offered for sale is in the province of Bocas del Toro, which is situated in the north west corner of Panama . Ian Usher is now trying to tempt people to follow in his footsteps and live the exotic life in Central America . Ian Usher's island is remote and peaceful, with a friendly community and the promise of reasonable restaurants . The country is the most southern in Central America . 'Heading to Panama to start a new life there was again a big step into the unknown. But life here has become easy and comfortable.' Life in the tropics although magical is not without its stresses, he emphasises. The island is fringed rather than picture postcard sandy beaches, he warns. Any new owner should be aware that thefts are common. And dreamy sunsets are disturbed by the presence of stinging tropical midge-like insects called chitras. But at least the buyer can expect a warm welcome from the community. Mr Usher wrote: 'For me, one of the most wonderful aspects of living down here is the mix of people that live here, or have come here to make a fresh start for themselves. The blend of local Panamanians, indigenous Indians and gringo ex-pats makes for a very intersting lifestyle and social circle. 'Through building here I have met many of the local Panamanian people, both in work situations, and socially, and have found them to be very open, friendly and fun-loving people. ' Once a buyer is found Mr Usher plans to buy a sailing boat and explore the Caribbean. The film rights to his incredible story have, unsurprisingly, already been snapped up by Disney. Property: the buyer will get a 2.2 acre Caribbean island home off the coast of Panama, in the tropical archipelago of Bocas del Toro.There is a two-bedroom house on the island with rainwater collection and solar power. There are also two wooden docks, a solid dock made from rocks, a large storage shed, two boads and a couple of kayukus (local style canoes) Peace and privacy: To reach the mainland or the capital of Panama, the owner can get a speedboat water-taxi or fly - so there'll be no busy motorway built outside their front door. Price: The money would not be enough to buy even an average-sized terraced house in London, so they would get more for their money. Food: Fresh fish at bargain prices along with cheap restaurants would make this place a dream for anyone who enjoys dining out or seafood . Economy: With an unemployment rate of 2.7 per cent, a mushrooming tourism industry and an economic boom, Panama is flourishing.","Five years after selling his old life off, Ian Usher wants to travel again .

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has a degree in economics, but admits even he struggles to understand the Financial Fair Play regulations and called for UEFA to make them clearer. Both Manchester City and Paris St Germain, clubs backed by wealthy Middle East owners, have been issued heavy fines for spending beyond their means. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho believes clubs which breach the rules should be docked points and stripped of any titles. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger admits he has struggled to understand Financial Fair Play rules . Wenger takes an Arsenal training session at London Colney on Monday . City were fined £49million last May, after winning the 2013-14 Barclays Premier League championship, for infringing FFP regulations, but nevertheless went on to make the biggest English outlay of the transfer window in spending £28million on striker Wilfried Bony from Cardiff. Wenger has long championed a need for football to get their finances in order. But the French coach, who studied Politics and Economics at the University of Strasbourg, has been left perplexed by just what UEFA have set out. 'It depends what you call Financial Fair Play as that notion has changed,' said Wenger. 'Is it just your income created by the gates? Is it the gates and commercial? 'Is it only the gates and the television? Is it naming rights as well? 'It is not clear to people what Financial Fair Play means, the rules are very complicated.' Jose Mourinho believes clubs which breach the rules should be docked points and stripped of any titles . Manchester City made the biggest outlay of the transfer window by signig Wilfried Bony for £28million . Wenger, 65, continued: 'We are a popular sport, so you want to clear and simple rules for everybody to understand. 'If I ask 10 people in the street today (what it means) and then if you ask me, and I am in the job, I don't have a clear idea anymore of what it means.' Arsenal continue to move forwards from a solid financial base which is built around the revenue generated from their 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium rather than the deep pockets of American owner Stan Kroenke. Wenger said: 'The Financial Fair Play rules have to be respected by everybody and if one club respected always the Financial Fair Play, and you can underline always, it is Arsenal, then we do not have to talk about that.'","Arsene Wenger calls upon UEFA to make Financial Fair Play rules clearer .

"It sounds like the stuff of Hollywood fiction. But a pill that wipes out bad memories could eventually become reality, scientists believe. Experiments on mice found those given fingolimod, a drug used to treat multiple sclerosis, completely forgot about previous experiences that had brought them physical pain. The US study, at Virginia Commonwealth University, offers hope of a drug that could eradicate memories of traumatic events from years ago and help patients overcome phobias, eating disorders and even sexual hang-ups. Experiments on mice found those given fingolimod, a drug used to treat multiple sclerosis, completely forgot about previous experiences that had brought them physical pain (stock image) It mirrors the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which starred Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey, in which a couple used a technique to erase memories of each other when their relationship soured. Fingolimod, available as a tablet under the brand name Gilenya, treats remitting forms of MS by suppressing the immune system. Dr Sarah Spiegel, of the Virginia Commonwealth University, USA, and colleagues found it can also inhibit an enzyme called histone deacetylase, a key protein that regulates gene expression. When fed to mice, fingolimod crossed the blood brain barrier and helped them quickly forget recent unpleasant episodes. They were put in a chamber where their feet were exposed to a mild electric shock, and when returned to the cage their ‘freezing’ behaviour was recorded as a measure of anxiety. This complete lack of movement, a characteristic fear response in rodents providing a good readout of memory, subsided rapidly after receiving the drug. The findings mirror the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, pictured, in which a couple used a technique to erase memories of each other when their relationship soured . Dr Spiegel said: 'Fingolimod, a Food and Drug Administration approved drug for treatment of multiple sclerosis, has beneficial effects in the central nervous system that are not yet well understood. 'Fingolimod deserves consideration as an adjuvant therapy for post traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders.' In theory, such a pill could eradicate memories of traumatic events that happened years ago. But there are ethical concerns that it could eradicate the very essence of what makes us human as well as have damaging psychological consequences, preventing those who take it from learning from their mistakes. The ability to remove memories has been the stuff of science fiction for decades.","Mice given fingolimod forgot about previous experiences that brought pain .

"Suspect: Manchester Mayor Ronald Drake revealed this afternoon that the suspected gunman was his nephew, 43-year-old Rick Smith, pictured. He was later killed in a shootout with police . Police are trying to piece together why an Illinois man who shot dead a family of five yesterday morning scooped up a six-year-old girl who survived the spray of gunshots and demanded a neighbor take her to hospital. Rick Odell Smith, 43, broke into the home in the small town of Manchester, where his uncle is mayor, and gunned down a great-grandmother, a young couple and three young children, authorities said. But when the suspect noticed the young girl was still alive despite serious gunshot wounds, he scooped her up and carried her to a neighbor's home, risking precious getaway time. The child, Kassidy Ralston, was rushed to Springfield hospital where she remained in critical condition with facial injuries, according to Q13Fox.com. Smith then jumped into his white Chevy Lumina and sped off. But officers caught up with him hours later and he ultimately died in a shootout with police. State Police Lt. Col. Todd Kilby couldn't explain Smith's apparent concern for the young victim. 'All I have is that it was a neighbor' who took her in, he told reporters at a press conference. A source told the TV station that Smith asked the neighbor to take the girl to hospital. The neighbor called police. State police would not comment on a possible motive. But a neighbor told Q13Fox.com that Smith had been going through a messy custody battle with the great-grandmother Joanne Sinclair's daughter over their four-year-old child. Shocking: Brittney Luark, 22, with sons Brantley and Nolan, was shot in Manchestor, Ill. home with her family . Tragic: One-year-old Brantley Ralston was shot dead on Wednesday. His parents, 5-year-old brother and great-grandmother were also killed . Neither she nor his daughter were in the home at the time of the shooting, authorities and the family told the station. 'He . was under a lot of stress. ...There was a lot of problems with custody . with the daughter,' said a neighbor of Smith's near his home in . Roodhouse. The neighbor . said Smith and Sinclair's daughter were together for about five years . and had lived with one another at the Roodhouse property until recently. The neighbor described Smith as a hardworking handyman. 'He did odd jobs for people, he could fix anything. He was a really hard worker,' the neighbor told Q13Fox.com. According to the neighbor, Smith had custody of his daughter fairly often but there was 'a lot of friction with (her) family.' Manchester . Mayor Ronald Drake revealed this afternoon that the suspected gunman in . the horrific slaying was his nephew, Rick Smith. The . dead were identified by family as Joanne Sinclair, 65, her . granddaughter Brittney Luark, 22, the girl's boyfriend James Roy . Ralston, and the couple's sons Nolan Ralston, 5, and Brantley Ralston, . 1. Kassidy Ralston suffered gunshot wounds and remains in . critical condition, Sinclair's son-in-law Brad Teeter told the Chicago . Tribune. Family: Brittney's boyfriend James Roy Ralston, with Nolan Ralston, was killed in the shooting . Senseless: Five-year-old Nolan Ralston was also killed in the tragedy . Lt. Col. Kilby said Smith entered the home . through a back door. They say two victims were found in one bedroom, two . in another bedroom and an adult male in a hallway. Police believe Smith and the victims were acquainted but have not provided details. The small village of Manchester, that has a . population of just 350, is in shock over the senseless tragedy. A neighbor called police and told them that Smith fled the home in the white sedan. A car chase ensued, leading authorities to the nearby town of Winchester. The . suspect was ultimately captured after a dramatic shootout with the . police. He later died at a hospital. Police said they found a rifle, shotgun and large hunting knife in Smith's car. Mayor Drake identified the gunman as his nephew on Wednesday afternoon. He said he hadn't spoken to Smith in two years, but he believed his nephew was unemployed. Drake said the last time Smith contacted him was to borrow tools. Tragic: A tragedy unfolded in the tiny Illinois town on Manchester, when five people were found shot dead early on Wednesday . Deadly: Police officials investigate the scene at a house in Manchester, Ill., where the five victims were found dead . Scott County State's Attorney Michael . Hill said Smith, of rural Morgan County, had previous convictions for . reckless homicide, drugs and bad checks. The family lived in a first-floor apartment of a housing development, according to state police spokeswoman Monique Bond. 'The guy broke into the house,' Mr Teeter told the local paper. 'I . couldn't tell you about the guy, never met him, never seen him, never . talked to him. Apparently broke into the home of my wife's mother and . shot everybody inside.' 'I'm at a loss right now,' he said. Schools in . Manchester, which is located 50 miles west from Springfield, Ill. and . about 90 miles north of St. Louis, Mo., were closed after officials from . the local sheriff warned school administrators that the suspect was . still on the loose early Wednesday morning. Hallway: Two victims were found in one bedroom, two in another bedroom and their children's father, James Ralston, pictured, was in a hallway . Innocence: Relatives are in shock over the tragic shooting that left little Brantley Ralston, 1, dead. Four of his relatives were also killed . Les Stevens of the North Greene . School District says he was told that the victims had been shot to . death. The district was later informed that Smith had been captured. The village has a total area of 1.06 square miles. 'It's a tragedy,' Mayor Drake said earlier to the Tribune. 'I've lived here for 43 years and my wife's lived her for all of her life and there's never been a homicide.' Manchester . resident Julie Hardwick, 48, said she lives in the same county housing . authority complex as the victims. 'The kids were really nice,' Hardwick said of the family. 'You couldn't ask for better kids.' The Rev. Robin Lyons of Manchester United Methodist Church, one of two churches in the community said, 'this shows tragedy can happen anywhere.' Two area school superintendents said they received calls from county sheriffs before 6 a.m. informing them that five people had been shot to death at a house in Manchester and that a suspect was at large. Superintendent David Roberts of the Winchester School District and Les Stevens of the North Greene Unit District No. 3 both said they immediately canceled classes when they were told of the shootings and that other school districts did the same. Roberts said the wounded girl is a student at Winchester Grade School and her teacher was with her at the Springfield hospital.","Gunman shot dead Joanne Sinclair, 65, her granddaughter .

"Idea: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will announce the setting up of new body Genomics England . Every elderly patient with a long-term health condition will be assigned a doctor or nurse to track their care through the NHS, Jeremy Hunt will announce today. The Health Secretary wants a named clinician to be responsible for overseeing the treatment of vulnerable pensioners while they are out of hospital – whether they live at home or in residential care. It will mean that from next year, older people and their families will always know who to  contact when they have a question about their treatment. At present, many feel they are passed from pillar to post and never speak to anyone who fully understands their situation. Mr Hunt will say that just as a consultant is in charge of a patient’s care in hospital, so a GP, community doctor or nurse should be put in charge of an older  person’s care out of hospital. This will mean that every element of their treatment is tailored around their needs whether they have one, two, three or more long-term conditions, or are trying to settle back at home after a fall. Long-term conditions could be those needing treatment with courses of drugs or regular tests at hospital or a local surgery. It should mean over-65s who suffer from conditions such as asthma, diabetes, kidney disease or angina receive better care. Knowing how to contact: Mr Hunt wants a named clinician to be responsible for overseeing the treatment of vulnerable pensioners while they are out of hospital - whether they live at home or in residential care . Local NHS bodies will decide which clinician should be given the responsibility of dealing with a patient. It could be the patient’s GP but in many cases, they will not be the best person because a patient may be dealing with doctors in hospitals more often. The Health Secretary has told NHS England to have named clinicians in place from next April. Mr Hunt will say: ‘The challenge today is to provide integrated, coordinated out-of-hospital care, something where the NHS, with our tradition of family doctors and primary care, could lead the world. ‘But to do that we need to know that there is a clinician accountable for vulnerable older people in the community just as there is a consultant responsible for them in hospital. 'As a member of the public I would like that to be my GP – but whoever it is they should be named so that patients, families and carers all know where the buck stops. ‘We are proposing to ask NHS England to make sure there is a named clinician responsible for every vulnerable older person whether or not they are in hospital.’ Mr Hunt will make the announcement as the NHS celebrates its 65th anniversary today. But he will also take time to explain why it needs to change with the times. Treatment: The plan should mean over-65s who suffer from conditions such as asthma, diabetes, kidney disease or angina receive better care . He will say: ‘As we celebrate, we also . reflect. The world today is very different to 1948. The old model was . curable illnesses where you were sent into hospital unwell and came out . better. ‘Yet most people now leave hospital with long-term conditions which need to be supported and managed at home. ‘Fully one-quarter of the population now . has a chronic condition...  all of whom need radically different models . of care to what the NHS has been accustomed to.’ 'The world today is very different to 1948. The old model was curable illnesses where you were sent into hospital unwell and came out better' Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt . Mr Hunt will also announce the setting up of a new body, Genomics England. By December, Britain will be the first country in the world to sequence the genomes of up to 100,000 patients within five years, to improve our understanding of disease and to design treatments better tailored to individuals. It comes as Mr Hunt reiterated his support for the abortion limit to be cut to 12 weeks, saying in an interview with Commons magazine House that if there is a free vote on the issue in the coming years, ‘I will always vote with my conscience’. He added: ‘But as Secretary of State I will implement whatever it is Parliament decides on, even if it’s not what I personally believe.’ And he agreed with crossbencher Baroness Finlay who last week called for the Liverpool Care Pathway to have a name change, because it sounded like a ‘one-way ticket’ to death. ‘I think that is quite a good point,’ he said.","Jeremy Hunt wants clinician to oversee patient treatment out of hospital .

"Reaction: Arthur Stevenson-Hart became 'very giddy' A Frankenstein food breakfast cereal designed for children and packed with additives linked to bad behaviour and hyperactivity is being sold in Britain. Lucky Charms, which is imported from the US, is the first mainstream GM food to go on sale in this country. The cereal, which is being sold by Tesco, is at the vanguard of what GM advocates hope will be numerous products to arrive in kitchens here. Its use of genetically modified corn is buried in small print on the package. GM corn has been eaten in the US for more than a decade. However, critics of the technology argue that not enough research has been carried out to ensure these foods are safe. Most GM corn plants have been modified in the laboratory to contain a toxin that kills pests that feed on them. Potentially more alarming is the fact that the cereal contains a number of artificial colours that the Food Standards Agency urges manufacturers not to use because research found a possible association with hyperactivity in young children. Lucky Charms is marketed as a nutritious cereal for children, but contains four suspect colourings – Tartrazine, Sunset Yellow, Brilliant Blue and Allura Red. Tesco bans the use of GM ingredients from its own-label foods, including breakfast cereals, on the basis that British families have rejected the technology. However, this ban does not apply to other brands and the store has also lifted its ban on the use of GM animal feed at farms that supply meat, milk and eggs. General Mills, which makes Lucky Charms, points to its wholegrain content and describes the mix of corn, soya, sugar and marshmallow as ‘magically delicious’. However, one father said Tesco was ‘letting customers down’ by selling it. Paul Stevenson, a psychotherapist from Twickenham, south-west London, said his nine-year-old son Arthur became ‘very giddy’, talked incessantly and was extremely hyperactive after eating the cereal, which Tesco is selling at a premium price of £5 a box. ‘As his behaviour became more and more unusually hyper and lacking attention I then noticed that he was enthusiastically eating and talking about this new cereal called Lucky Charms,’ said Mr Stevenson. ‘I checked the box and found out that in very small lettering it said that it was a GM food. Small print: Tesco says that Lucky Charms adhere to the 'relevant legislation' even if it may have adverse effects . ‘I destroyed the packet and he calmed down the next day but I was very concerned and angry.’ It seems likely that the adverse reaction was caused by the suspect colours. There is a smallprint warning on the pack that the cereal may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children. Mr Stevenson said the cereal was on prominent display at the local Tesco and is sold in a packet that is ‘extremely attractive to little kids’. Pete Riley, of campaign group  GM Freeze, called on customers to boycott Tesco. ‘The idea of promoting a cereal to children that is not only GM but also contains suspect colours does not seem to me to be the correct policy for a company that claims to be a responsible retailer,’ he said. General Mills said it does not supply the cereal to UK stores and that Tesco had ordered its supplies from a third party importer. The supermarket said in a statement: ‘We sell this branded product as part of our world foods range. The product ingredients are clearly labelled and are in line with relevant legislation.’","Imported Lucky Charms can have adverse effects on children's behaviour .

"A little dishy wasn't quite big enough for this fishy - nor was the door of Rab McAleese's restaurant. The owner of the Little Italy eatery in Dumfries forked out £1,500 the huge halibut and had it shipped to his restaurant in a refrigerated truck. Only when it arrived did Mr McAleese realise just how big the seven-foot tall, 16-stone whopper actually was. Little dishy? Rab McAleese (left) and chef Ashley Rainbow (right) realise they might need a bigger pan for the halibut . The 38-year-old restaurateur had to resort to filleting the 103kg fish in the restaurant forecourt with the help of fellow chef Ashley Rainbow before he could get it into the kitchen on the second floor. Passers-by watched in amazement as they laid plastic on the ground and set to the halibut with knives. 'We got a call from the fish market saying one of the trawlers had caught this huge fish and asked if I would be interested in taking it,' Mr McAleese said. 'I jumped at the chance because we specialise in seafood dishes and I wanted to have a halibut week at the restaurant. 'I didn't realise how big it was until it arrived though. I was stunned. 'Our kitchen is upstairs and there was no way we could fit it inside. I hadn't really given it much thought before it arrived. Not your usual plaice: The halibut had to be filleted in the forecourt of the restaurant before it could be carried to the second floor kitchen . 'Myself and my chef Ashley had to take it off the bone outside. 'It took about an hour and people passing by couldn't believe it, we stopped the traffic on the street outside and nearly caused an accident. 'The fish was very heavy and it was very slippery to handle. 'We had to get three guys to suspend it with a rope from our top window just to get our photo taken with it.' Mr McAleese paid £15 a kilo - £1,545 in total - for the halibut at Glasgow Fish Market after it was line caught off the north coast of Scotland. The 200 that he managed to carve it into were gobbled up by diners in less than a week. Mr McAleese added: 'There was a lot of talk about it in the town because so many people had saw it when it arrived. 'It sold it in less than a week. 'Catches like that are fairly rare but I would definitely buy another one.' Shell out: The fish cost £15 per kilo and cost £1,545 in total . At 16 stones, Rab's fish is still somewhat shy of the largest halibut ever caught - a 34st whopper caught by German angler Gunther Hansel in 2010, which was sold for £2,500. The previous largest halibut was a 33st fish caught off Norway in 2009. Earlier this year, staff at the Crabshakk restaurant in Glasgow took delivery of an 11st halibut. Atlantic halibut are among the largest fish in the world and can grow up to 15ft long.","Rab McAleese buys seven-foot tall fish from Glasgow Fish Market to serve in restaurant .

"As you might imagine, being a professional alligator trapper, the job comes with some inherent dangers. Firstly, there's always the possibility that you could fall into the swap or lake you've been assigned to, or get bitten by the mosquitoes. However, there is always that niggling possibility that the gator itself might try and get the better of you. Scroll down for video... Alligator rescuer: Jason Clark captures alligators for a living but even this 3 1/2 fella tested his skills . Spotted: Jason tries to bait the alligator to come over to him on the shoreline . Easy target: Or so it appears... but this gator has other plans! This is what happened to one alligator catcher in Georgia. Residents of Lawrenceville near Atlanta, spotted a 20 pound gator several months back in their usually peaceful lake. Since last fall, reports of the 3 ½-foot gator, large enough to eat a small dog, was seen lurking beneath its still waters. It made the residents feel uneasy, especially if the gator grew any larger. They called upon the services of Southeastern Reptile Rescue  husband & wife team, Sarah & Jason Clark whose specialism is trapping these scaly creatures once and for all. No choice: Jason has the gator by its tail - he's coming out whether he likes it or not! Got him: Within two minutes of spotting him, Jason had the gator by his tail . It wasn't long before the target was . spotted basking in the spring Georgia sunshine. It took them four days . before they were able to get close enough to capture it. 'It . needs to be that first try to get him when he's like, 'I don't really . know what they're doing,'' Sarah Clark told local station WSBTV. Oh snap! Jason wasn't expecting that - and he does this for a living! Bonded: The alligator is well and truly attached to Jason at this point, and probably thinks he's got himself a juicy meal . Making his mark: Jason won't forget this rescue any time soon. The alligator left between 15-20 teethmarks on his arm . Jason went to grab it, tail first of course, but what happened next he did not expect. The aggravated alligator spun its head around and bit into Jason's forearm, tearing at his skin. When alligators bite they can exert a jaw pressure of 3000 pounds per square inch. It's not an easy task trying to remove them. 'If he would have started rolling, he could have bit a chuck out of his arm,' Sarah, said. 'There's a gator bite for ya,' Jason laughed. 'Put the pole down. Grab his head,' he told her. With his wife's help, Jason was finally able to free the alligator and its teeth from his arm. See you later: Alligator captured and pond secured, the reptile will likely be taken to a local zoo so children can enjoy their beauty and learn about their dangers . No messing: Alligators can grow up to 14t long weigh over 450 kg. They can have up to 75 teeth . The gator certainly left its mark with around 20 teeth marks, but the residents are pleased that finally their pond is at last gator-free. It's not known how the alligator ended up in the pond but it is likely that it was once a pet whose owner was unable to look after it once it grew larger.","3½ foot alligator spotted in quiet residential pond .

"Amazing: Vicki Williams with her son Ted, now one, after her 'serene' freebirth at home . 'Every time a woman says ""birth was . awful, but my baby is worth it"", I'm sad that they didn't have the . chance to have a birth that made them say ""it was the most amazing thing . I have ever done,""' says Vicki Williams, a 42-year-old mother of six . from the East Midlands. Vicki is one of a small number of women to choose 'freebirthing', a natural way to give birth without interference from doctors, nurses or midwives - even without going into hospital at all. Two of her sons, eight-year-old Joe and two-year-old Ted, were born at home and birthed by Vicki without the help of medical staff, a midwife or even the emotional support of a doula. The experience, she says, was 'amazing', adding: 'it was beautiful, it was serene and it was easier than running cross country at school!' But is 'freebirthing' really all it’s cracked up to be? More importantly, can it really be possible to give birth unassisted without putting your life and the life of your child at risk? Unsurprisingly, the medical establishment is divided on the issue. Some doctors argue that giving birth without assistance is far too dangerous. But the Nursing and Midwifery Council disagree. Last year they released a statement saying midwives had 'no right' to be present at a birth and that the wishes of mothers who chose not to have one present should be respected. Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists spokesperson Dr Daghni Rajasingam is quietly supportive of freebirthing, although she warns that things can sometimes go wrong. 'Some emergency situations are difficult to predict,' she said in an interview with the Guardian. 'There are problems that need intervention within minutes – for example, if the baby is getting distressed, if the baby's shoulders get stuck, or if the cord prolapses. In any of these situations, you need a professional birth attendant who'll know what to do and can arrange for you to transfer to hospital if you're giving birth at home.' The alternative: For the majority of women, birth takes place in the unfamiliar confines of a hospital room . More than 342,900 women die in childbirth every year around the world - most of them in developing countries. In the UK, a woman's lifetime risk of dying is just 1 in 8,000. In a tragic case last year, an Australian coroner openly criticised one mother's decision to give birth unassisted after her baby died during delivery, according to reports in The Sydney Morning Herald. The umbilical cord became wrapped around Roisin Fraser's neck - a situation, according to coroner Scott Mitchell, that neither her mother Janet nor father Trevor Stokes were equipped to deal with. But does that make it wrong? No, insists veteran doula Lisa Sykes, 39, who says giving birth will never be entirely safe, whether it's done at home or in a hospital. 'There are no risk free options,' she explains. 'There are risks associated with birthing in hospital; for instance, you're statistically more likely to end up having a Caesarean section when planning a birth overseen by consultant obstetricians. 'You're also statistically safer at home with midwives in attendance than you are in a consultant led unit. 'Risk is personal. It isn't for me to say who should and shouldn't be making particular choices in life.' Interestingly, the BirthPlace study carried out by the Royal College of Midwives and published last week, would appear to back Sykes' claims. Among the more startling revelations in the report was the fact that mothers giving birth at home are more likely to have normal deliveries and less likely to need invasive procedures such as caesarians and the use of forceps. Vicki believes studies like this should be a wake up call to the medical profession. 'There is a great deal of fear, and an . unhealthy dose of arrogance, among those professionals who think that they . know better when it comes to what is good for a woman than she does herself,' she . explains. 'If something goes . wrong during childbirth, the mother is the one who bears the pain for the rest of her . life, not her care-givers, so only she can make the decision about what . risks she is and is not prepared to take. 'The death of your baby isn't the only outcome that might leave you in distress for the rest of your life. Happy outcome: Ultimately, both mothers and medical establishment want the same thing - a healthy baby . 'Disempowerment, feelings of having been abused, fear of death or danger in a situation where you feel out of control, harsh treatment and feeling violated during the birth process can all cause trauma. 'A woman deserves to feel like a goddess when she brings her child into the world, and to be able to remember that feeling.' However, not all mothers find the experience of freebirthing as pleasant as they'd hoped. Melissa Thomas, 27, who gave birth to her son Oliver, now one, alone at home last year, was reported to social services by a midwife uncomfortable with her decision. 'Giving birth alone felt normal,' she says. 'It was liberating, natural, calm and wonderful. I didn't want to invite anyone else into [my] space.' But the run up to her 'wonderful' birth was marred by an intervention from social services, and Melissa feels things could have been handled very differently. 'I understand the difficult position the midwife who made the referral may have found herself in,' says Melissa, 'but I do feel that there could have been a different approach.' She continues: 'I spoke to the supervisor of midwives twice about my plans and she seemed understanding and supportive so I was disheartened to find out about the referral. 'I'm upset about the way in which my life was intruded upon and the lack of decency and respect with which I and my family were treated.' Upsetting though Melissa's experience was, the midwife's reaction, although contrary to advice issued by the General Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council, was perhaps understandable in light of how few freebirths there are each year. According to the most recent figures released by the Office of National Statistics, 723,913 babies were born in 2011. Of those, it is estimated that just 30 were freebirths. Nevertheless, as information on freebirthing becomes more widely available, it's likely that the numbers of women opting for unassisted births will increase. At the very least, says Vicki, women need to know that they aren't required to submit to medical care and are free to decline any and all of it if they want to. 'Freebirthing is not right for everyone,' she adds. 'Some women want to give birth surrounded by others and some women want others to take responsibility for them. 'Even if we all have the same information, we won't necessarily make the same choices and that is a good thing. But every woman should have the choice.'","Freebirthing means giving birth without help from a doctor or midwife .

"Created: . 11:54 EST, 27 June 2014 . A Muslim who stabbed a pregnant Romanian prostitute to death was jailed for at least 29 years today. Farooq Shah, 21, plunged a knife into Mariana Popa’s chest while riding his bicycle along a stretch of road notorious for sex workers. Miss Popa, 24, had been in Britain for just three weeks and was trying to earn the money to support her family when she was stabbed in Ilford, Essex. Farooq Shah, left, plunged a knife into Mariana Popa, right, while riding his bicycle along a stretch of road notorious for sex workers . She staggered into Chicken & Pizza 4U in Ilford Lane and collapsed in a pool of blood as her killer rode away on his bike. The mother-of-one was six weeks pregnant with her second child when she bled to death. CCTV footage showed Shah waiting on the forecourt of a BP garage close to where prostitutes were working on Ilford Lane late on October 28. Miss Popa could then be seen to walk towards him and speak to him before he stabbed her twice in the chest. Prosecutors suggested Shah was warning Miss Popa to leave the area or that he attempted to engage her services - and she paid with her life when she refused. Shah’s distinctive appearance exactly matched that of the killer - but he claimed he was the victim of mistaken identity. Ian Bourne, QC, defending, said CCTV footage of Miss Popa's killer is of too poor a quality to be match to Shah. 'The footage may be showing another person with very similar characteristics to the defendant,' he said. 'All these images are poor in terms of quality. 'And the appearance of a bald or shaved head Muslim man with a bushy beard isn't unique in Ilford'. Shah was found with another stolen mobile when he was arrested for the murder of Miss Popa. CCTV images shown in court captured the moment Mariana Popa was confronted by Farooq Shah near his local mosque in Ilford, Essex . Shah claimed he was at home watching an episode of Family Guy at the time of the killing after returning from a party in Plaistow drunk and high from smoking cannabis. He said a mystery man approached him on the street while on his way home and sold him the phone. Judge Christopher Kinch QC jailed Shah for life and ordered he serve at least 29 years behind bars. The judge said: ‘It was an utterly terrible attack which inevitably led to her death. It was carried out with callous indifference on a defenceless woman. Mariana Popa did not stand a chance.’ During the trial Bobbie Cheema QC, prosecuting, asked Shah: ‘What was that conversation with Miss Popa about? ‘Did you ask her to go with you? Did you offer her money? Did she say no because you had a bike and didn’t even have a car? Jurors were shown CCTV footage of Farooq Shah from the night he murdered Romanian sex worker Mariana Popa, 24 . ‘Or were you on this night patrolling the area for prostitutes? Did you want to challenge Miss Popa and ask her to get out of that area, to get away from the mosques?’ In his account to the jury, Shah said having women sell their bodies near his mosque or home ‘means nothing’. He insisted he would never need to hand over money for sex. ‘I would never, ever do that, I’d never pay money for sex. Look at me - I’m not an ugly man’. An hour before Shah stabbed Miss Popa, he had robbed Ikran Chohan, a blind man of £400 and his mobile phone at knifepoint. A bicycle matching the description of Miss Popa’s killer and Mr Chohan’s assailant was also found outside Shah’s flat on St Francis Way. In a statement Miss Popa’s boyfriend, Nicolae Drezaliu, said the two of them had moved to London just three weeks before she was killed, following the news that she was pregnant. Jurors heard the couple, who left the Romanian city of Caracal in 2012 for Italy, decided to move to Ilford where Miss Popa had friends. ‘It was while we were in Italy Mariana told me she was pregnant. It was a wanted pregnancy, we wanted to have a child’, Mr Drezaliu said. ‘Two or three nights she worked until 12.30am and then one time she didn’t come back until 9am - she told me she had slept at friends, there was no reason to be suspicious at the time. ‘After she was murdered police told me it was possible she was working as a prostitute on Ilford Lane. ‘I’m still in shock and devastated. Our plans to have a family have been dashed’. Shah, of Station Road, Forest Gate, east London, was found guilty of murdering Miss Popa and robbing Mr Chohan. He was given six years in jail for the robbery to run concurrent.","Mariana Popa was six weeks pregnant when she was knifed by Farooq Shah .

"Freed: Jennice Lynch, 19, has been given a suspended sentence after burgling her parents . A middle-class couple who shopped their tearaway daughter to police when she burgled the family home yesterday criticised a judge for sparing her jail. Ruth and John Lynch hoped 19-year-old Jennice would be sent to prison as a ‘wake-up call’ after years of stealing and poor behaviour. They said their family were left devastated by their daughter’s betrayal when she raided their £300,000 home three times in just a few weeks, stealing jewellery, including her father’s £4,000 gold watch. But despite her guilty plea to three counts of burglary, Recorder Kevin Talbot allowed Jennice to walk free with a 22-month  suspended sentence. Last night Mrs Lynch, 45, and her company director husband, John, 46, labelled the punishment a ‘joke’ and said it would not deter Jennice from stealing again. ‘Most people would be ashamed if they behaved this way, but not our daughter,’ Mrs Lynch said. ‘She is uncaring and cold and it’s about time she got severely punished because she needs a wake-up call. ‘The suspended sentence was a joke and she will see this as a reason to do it all again. The thieving has gone on for donkeys’ years, and going to court was our last resort. We just couldn’t go on.’ Jennice, who is unemployed and lives off  benefits, is the couple’s fourth-born of five daughters. The couple said they have not had problems with any of their other children. One is an accountant, another is a company manager, the third eldest is studying at university to be an engineer while the youngest is still at school. Family: Ruth Lynch, right, wants her daughter Jennice, second left, to be sent to prison . Targeted: The teenager stole possessions from her own family home, pictured, in Whitworth, Lancashire . Mrs Lynch said problems began at a . young age with Jennice when the couple were asked to move her from a . nursery for being badly behaved. She had problems throughout school . and aged 14 she allegedly arranged for the family’s Land Rover Discovery . to be stolen after she was scolded by her parents for coming home . drunk. Mr and Mrs Lynch were so concerned . they moved to Spain with the girls to make a fresh start, but Jennice . failed her GCSEs and her thieving sprees continued. At 16, she moved back to England and . began a relationship with a man 20 years older. She went on to have two . children by him, now aged one and two. Mrs Lynch said the couple came back . to England after being told by social services their daughter was . pregnant. She added that they have always supported her financially, . looked after her children and even paid a deposit for her flat, which . she trashed. Tearaway: The teenage mother's parents begged for her to be jailed to protect other people . Despair: Mrs Lynch says, 'It's about time she got severely punished, because she needs a wake-up call' ‘She will probably be as proud as . punch at having her 15 minutes of fame in court,’ Mrs Lynch said. ‘I bet . she will even cut out any newspaper clippings and stick them on her . wall.’ A former school governor, Mrs Lynch . added: ‘As a parent you always want the best for your kids, we don’t . push them to be something supersonic, it is more a case of being happy . and getting on in life. ‘For us, getting the police involved . was very much a last resort. I was hoping prison might nip it in the . bud.’ Burnley Crown Court was told that the burglaries began on October 5 . last year when Jennice broke into the couple’s home, in Whitworth, . Lancashire, and stole a gold and diamond bracelet. Just over a fortnight later, Jennice . smashed a toilet window and stole 14 cartons of cigarettes, before the . final burglary on November 30 when she smashed a patio door with a . brick, showering her own children’s toys with glass, before stealing Mr . Lynch’s 18-carat gold watch. In police interviews Jennice claimed . she had carried out one of the raids because her mother had ignored her . and given her a ‘dirty look’ earlier in the day. Well-off: The family's four other daughters have all embarked on professional careers . Nick Dearing, defending, told the court that Jennice was a ‘deeply troubled and traumatised young lady’. ‘She has hurt those closest to her . for what she believes are perceived personal slights and a lack of . support from her mother,’ he said. Sentencing Jennice to 22 months’ youth custody, suspended for two years, the judge said: ‘Your  behaviour . has been mean, spiteful, motivated by malice and caused an enormous . amount of distress. 'You have made judgments about your parents and you . have done that for reasons which are, frankly, difficult to understand. ‘These were cunning, well-planned and skilfully carried out burglaries. 'You were engaged in acts really calculated, and it seems deliberately intended to hurt and hurt it did.’ He also served her with a 12-month exclusion order, banning her from going within 200 metres of her  parents’ home. Last night Jennice, who has been . living at a shelter for homeless teenagers, in Rawtenstall, Lancashire, . could not be contacted for comment.","Jennice Lynch, 19, burgled family home in Lancashire three times .

"The consultant was so curt and dismissive he made me feel as if my complaint was too trivial to warrant his attention. 'Plenty of women endure far worse than you and live with it,' he told me sharply. 'You can't expect your sex life to return to how it was. After all, you've had two children.' I felt shocked, humiliated, horrified. I had not gone to hospital to grumble that I was too tired for sex, or didn't feel alluring in my best underwear any more. I was there because childbirth had put an end to my sex life - completely. Lucy Wyatt, 34, with her children Henry, three, and one-year-old Emma . For the 18 months after my daughter Emma was born in September 2011, I was not physically intimate with my husband John at all. The idea of sex appalled and terrified me. In fact, sex had been practically non-existent since my son Henry was born two years before that. So much so it was nothing short of a miracle that Emma was conceived at all. The reason? My horrific experiences of childbirth. Everything, it seemed, that could have gone wrong had gone wrong, on both occasions. I was a walking compendium of gynaecological disasters. I suffered from such debilitating and embarrassing urinary incontinence, I was afraid to leave my home. After Emma was born, I'd suffered a double prolapse - where the walls of the vagina and bowel become detached. It was horribly humiliating and painful - and definitely not a condition that puts a couple in the mood. Small wonder, then, that I was terrified of the prospect of having sex with my beloved husband, John. I might have accepted this accelerated decline into celibacy and physical decrepitude if I'd been 90. But I'm 34, and my husband 38, and we had enjoyed a happy sex life. Yet I was made by the doctor to feel I was fussing needlessly; that to expect a resumption of my pre-baby sex life was as extravagant as it was selfish. Lucy with her first child Henry when he was just born . Today, after extensive surgery, things in the bedroom are finally back on track. But nothing will ever erase those years of humiliation and pain I suffered. I am convinced millions of women have suffered similarly. Online mothering forums are full of anonymous exchanges about sex lives and marriages ruined by the butchery of childbirth. We know the exhaustion brought on by sleepless nights often delays the resumption of intimacy between parents. But what is much less well-documented is how much physical problems caused by childbirth can impact on a woman's sexual desires. So why don't we talk about them? Because they are acutely embarrassing. That is why I have decided to identify myself: I want to embolden other mothers to seek help and stand their ground as I did. My trauma began when I had first child, Henry, in September 2009. Bringing him into the world was akin to a horror movie - I endured 36 hours in labour and countless stitches. Back at our home in Essex, the pain from my stitches was excruciating. I couldn't sit down. Walking was agonising. Five weeks after Henry's birth, I could endure it no longer, and went to my GP. She said that part of my vaginal wall had been incorrectly stitched outside my body. 'But you've had a baby. You can deal with pain. Just grip the side of the day-bed and I'll laser off the dead tissue,' she said blithely. Now, I'm good at suffering in silence, but after the extraordinary pain of lasering I felt brutalised. I would recoil from John's touch, and couldn't imagine ever having sex again, let alone having another baby. When Henry was five months old, I sunk into a pit of depression. As a wife I felt inadequate and as a mother I believed I'd failed. One day I strapped Henry into his buggy and walked him to the park, where I remember looking at the lake and seeing a mother and child nearby. I put the brake on the buggy and decided to leave Henry there. 'He'll be better off without me. The woman will see him and take him,' I thought as I walked purposefully away. Then, thank goodness, a switch in my brain flipped. I walked back sharply to fetch Henry, then went straight to my GP's surgery. 'I need help,' I begged between sobs. And it was then I began a course of counselling and antidepressants that signalled the slow haul back to normality. Lucy and her husband John on their wedding day . Even so, the idea of having sex still appalled and scared me. John was endlessly understanding. But the longer I postponed intimacy, the more drab and unattractive I felt. I remember thinking that books on new parenthood never touched on the squeamish details of the disorders which can follow childbirth. We're led to believe the worst we should expect is a transitory spell of baby blues, after which mum and baby will bond. It does not help, either, that celebrity magazines propagate the cruel myth that, weeks after giving birth, we snap back into shape and resume athletic sex lives. It was 15 months before John and I attempted sex after Henry was born. John was gentle, and I was relieved that the experience was not as painful as I'd feared. But then, to my horror, I discovered that after this one encounter  I was pregnant again. Fear and apprehension besieged me. I was right to be afraid; Emma's birth heralded a whole new set of disasters. For the last four months of the pregnancy, I had acute pelvic pain, and John and I did not have sex at all. I felt so inadequate as a wife, I even told John I'd understand if he had an affair. John said he wouldn't dream of it. He reiterated his promise that he'd wait for as long as it took. When Emma arrived, on September 9, 2011, the midwife was attentive and the birth relatively straightforward. Lucy with Emma and Henry sitting in hospital on the day Emma was born . This time, however, I'd opted for an epidural. But that precipitated my problems with incontinence. Soon after the birth, doctors told me I had suffered nerve damage which would be temporary. I was referred to a physiotherapist who gave me pelvic floor exercises, with limited success. However, there was even worse to come: childbirth had also caused my uterus and my womb and bowel to prolapse. Nine months after my daughter was born, I was an incontinent prisoner in my home. I lost interest in my appearance and put on weight. I was so frightened of sex, I even stopped being affectionate with John. Irrationally, I'd even started blaming my baby daughter for the physical mess I found myself in. Finally, last year I could endure it no longer. I went to a different, female GP who was sympathetic and referred me to a gynaecologist. It was he who told me, without a scintilla of understanding or kindness, that there is a price to pay for having kids, and this was it. I felt shocked, aggrieved; indignant. He made me feel as if my sex life was so inconsequential, I should not have troubled him about it. Lucy Wyatt could not bear the thought of sex after her daughter Emma was born, and said she even started blaming her baby for what had happened . I said I wanted surgery to repair my prolapse and cure my incontinence. He countered that an operation could make it worse and might adversely affect my sex life. But I had no sex life at all. How could it get any worse? I decided then I would have the operation, whatever the consequences. I had the surgery in September last year. It was an uncomfortable experience but, four months later, John and I finally felt like a loving couple again. The long-awaited event was unplanned. Henry and Emma were at nursery, when John and I decided to take a nap. Unexpectedly, we ended up making love. John was tender and understanding. I remember being terrified it would hurt, then crying with relief and happiness when it didn't. Nearly two months have elapsed and our lives have almost resumed their equilibrium. My incontinence has also improved markedly. I have not resumed my job as a driving instructor, and intend, for the time being, to enjoy being a full-time mother at home in Clavering. It has taken three-and-a-half years, but at last I also feel I am a proper wife again - and John and I are heartily grateful for that.","Lucy Wyatt, 34, from Essex, could not bear sex with husband John .

"An angler has smashed the world record for the biggest halibut fish ever caught on rod and line. The enormous flat fish tipped the scales at a whopping 37 stones - heavier than a wild gorilla. It was caught by Marco Liebenow who jokingly thought he had hooked into a submarine when the monster halibut took his bait. After taking 90 minutes reeling it towards the surface Marco and two friends tied a rope around the tail of the 9ft long fish and towed it back to shore where it was weighed at 513lbs . After taking 90 minutes reeling it towards the surface, the 9ft long fish was too big to haul onboard his small boat in Norway. So he and three friends tied a rope around its tail and towed it back to shore where it had to be hoisted on to the quayside by a crane. It weighed in at 513lbs, easily beating the existing record of 419lbs for an Atlantic halibut as recognised by the International Game Fishing Association. Marco, who is in his 30s and from Germany, has now submitted a claim to the IGFA and is awaiting confirmation. Marco Liebenow joked he had hooked into a submarine when the monster halibut took his bait . David Bottcher, of the angling tour company Angelreisen Hamburg that organised to fishing trip to Kjollefjord, Norway, said: 'David does not speak any English but has said it was a wonderful feeling to catch it and has called it a fish of a lifetime. 'When he first hooked it it felt like he has caught a submarine because it was so big. 'It took four men to bring it towards their 19ft boat and then they could only put a sling around its tail and pull it back to the harbour. 'Marco was elated afterwards and celebrated with the boat skipper and their housekeeper by having a few beers. 'Before he left for the trip, he called us first to ask for a few hints about how and where to fish - I guess our advice paid off. 'It looks like it is a world record for a halibut but we are waiting to have it confirmed.' Marco donated the halibut to a local fish dealer. Atlantic halibut - Hippoglossus hippoglossus in Latin - is among the largest bony fish in the world. Their native habitat is the the northern Atlantic, from Greenland to the Barents Sea and as far south as the Bay of Biscay. They can reach up to 15ft in length and weigh up to 700lbs and can live for 50 years. Their diet is usually other fish like cod, haddock and herring although they do face predation from seals and the Greenland shark.","Fish weighed 513lbs, beating existing record of 419lbs for Atlantic halibut .

"Thousands of bare-breasted young Swazi women paraded themselves in front of their king yesterday in a lavish ceremony to celebrate chastity and unity. Dressed in beaded skirts, clutching machetes and mobile phones, women and girls danced and sang tributes to the king and queen mother - also known as the Great She-Elephant - in a traditional Umhlanga Reed Dance to celebrate womanhood and virginity. Those taking part dismissed criticism of the extravagant celebrations on Sunday and Monday, which took place in one of Africa's poorest countries, ruled by the continent's last absolute monarch. Virgins: Maidens sing and dance outside the Queen Mother's Royal Palace after delivering reeds at Ludzidzini in Mbabane, Swaziland, on Sunday, ahead of Monday's Reed Dance . Celebrations: Thousand of virgins took part in the event in honour of a royal family which has in some quarters been criticised for being out of touch with a country where many live in abject poverty . National pride: Many of the women taking part stressed their dedication to their king and their chastity . 'I'm proud to be Swazi and to be a virgin. We are here to show unity with the king and with each other,' said 18-year-old Gcebine Dlamini. She braced herself against the cold of the southern hemisphere's winter in her skimpy outfit as scores of tourists had photos taken next to the topless women. King Mswati III, who has at least a dozen wives and a personal fortune estimated at $200million, faced unprecedented protests last year when his appointed administration ran out of money after a 2009 recession in neighbouring South Africa. Despite the touch economic climate, the royal household has shown few signs of wanting to tighten its belt.

'If chosen, I would be able to live a better life than what I have, have a lot of money, live a queen's life and travel overseas,' said Fakazile Dlamini, 14, who arrived on a lorry from her village 60km away to attend the ceremony. New royal wives have often received a BMW and their own palace, fuelling criticism in a country where more than two-thirds of its 1.4million people live in abject poverty. Women's groups and political opponents also say Mswati's penchant for multiple young brides is out of touch in a country with the world's highest rate of HIV/AIDS. The monarch says polygamy is part of Swazi tradition and helps cement national unity.

"He was viewed as Hitler’s finest general, admired even by the Allies for his skills as a military leader. But to one captured British soldier, Erwin Rommel was the man who saved his life – and gave him beer and cigarettes. Captain Roy Wooldridge, from the Royal Engineers, has told how he was introduced to the ‘Desert Fox’ after being taken prisoner in France. Scroll down for video . Lucky escape: Captain Roy Wooldridge (left after the war) has revealed how top Nazi general Erwin Rommel (right) saved his life after he was captured as a spy - and even served him a meal, beer and cigarettes . He had been caught during a covert night-time reconnaissance mission ahead of the D-Day landings. Without uniform or identification due to the secrecy of the operation, he was treated as a spy and told he would be shot. But Field Marshal Rommel requested a meeting with the new prisoner and asked the Brit if there was anything he needed. Captain Wooldridge said he replied: ‘A good meal, a pint of beer and a packet of cigarettes.’ To his astonishment he was then ushered into Rommel’s mess, where all three items were waiting for him. Capt Wooldridge, now 95, saved the empty cigarette packet as a souvenir and will recount his adventure on Sunday’s edition of Antiques Roadshow. He said: ‘I was told that Rommel always wanted to meet men who had been doing something unusual when they were captured. ‘I was meant to have been shot. I was told on several occasions during my interrogation that is what would happen unless I talked. ‘Hitler had issued orders that commandos were to be shot but Rommel declined to obey that instruction. Rommel saved my life. He was a very fine German and a clean fighter.’ Memento: Now 95, the former Royal Engineers soldier has kept the empty cigarette packet he was given . Ripe old age: The veteran is now 95 after working as the principal of Derby College of Art and Technology . As well as the cigarette packet, Capt Wooldridge’s Military Cross and Bar and a photo of him being presented with a ribbon to his MC by British army chief Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery will also be on display on the show. He is told by the programme’s experts that his collection is worth as much as £10,000 – but to applause from onlookers, he responds: ‘Not for sale.’ Capt Wooldridge was awarded the MC for a death-defying mission to clear a path through a minefield in Alamein while under mortar fire, and the Bar for his role in Operation Tarbrush, the mission that led to his capture. Then and now: Capt Wooldridge (left) will be telling his story to the BBC's Antiques Roadshow on Sunday . History: Captain Wooldridge receiving his Military Cross ribbon 'somewhere in the Western desert' Long life: Roy Wooldridge and his late wife Phyllis on their wedding day in May 1944. He was on his honeymoon when he was called up for the secret mission. He has lived a long and happy life, unlike Rommel . He was feared and respected by Britain's wartime generals, but Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was not universally loved by the Nazis. He was caught unawares by the D-Day landings because he was on his way to ask Hitler for permission to rearrange troops in France. Rommel had to make an urgent return in a failed bid to stop the Allied advance - but he fell out of favour with the Nazi high command. His apparent disobedience of orders to kill Allied spies would not have helped and according to his son Manfred, in the summer of 1944 the general wanted to surrender as he faced increased Allied troops. Hitler was having none of it - as he wanted to take the German people with him to the grave. Finally Rommel was forced to take his own life after being implicated in a failed plot to kill the Nazi leader. The general took cyanide so his family would be spared in October 1944, just four months after the D-Day landings. The true reasons behind his death were covered up until just a few years ago, when a report emerged by a doctor who confessed he had falsified the death certificate - to say Rommel died of a heart attack. The operation took place during a remarkable two weeks in which he got married, met the King to receive his MC, was captured and encountered Rommel. Capt Wooldridge, from Hendy, Glamorgan, said: ‘I was on my honeymoon in London and … there was a telegram asking me to report to my unit immediately and that Mrs Wooldridge was not to travel with me. Reconnaissance photos had spotted these obstacles just below the waterline and they couldn’t determine from the pictures what they were. 'They suspected they were some form of mine.’ Capt Wooldridge joined a group of four to carry out a series of covert night-time inspections – but on the last mission, they were seen by a German boat and captured. He recalled: ‘We were taken to a house and interrogated for two weeks. They wanted to know what we had been doing but I didn’t say anything. 'After that I was taken to a chateau and given a cup of tea and some cake. I was told to have a wash and smarten up because I was going to see someone very important. ‘I was marched into a room and there behind a desk was Rommel. I recognised him immediately because I had studied photographs of him while in the Western Desert.’ He continued: ‘Rommel asked me what I was doing in France but I didn’t say anything. He then asked me if there was anything I required. 'I just said I could do with a pint of beer, a packet of cigarettes and a good meal. Then I was dismissed. 'I was taken to his mess and served by his waiter and on the table was a stein [mug] of beer, cigarettes and a plate of food. I couldn’t understand it.’ Capt Wooldridge was taken to a PoW camp in northern Germany where he remained for the rest of the war. He went on to become principal of Derby College of Art and Technology. His wife Phyllis died 25 years ago, and he has two sons and three grandchildren. Rommel was forced to commit suicide in 1944 after being implicated in a plot to kill Hitler. He took his own life after assurances by the Nazis that if he did so, his family would be unharmed.

"The medical staff who saved the life of Boston terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev feel deep anxiety about what they have done. That is the honest assessment of Dr. Richard Wolfe, who along with other emergency medicine staff at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital rescued the seriously wounded teenage terror suspect on Friday. Dr. Wolfe recounted how in the aftermath of the young man's stabilization, the nurses were hit by a serious dilemma - 'They look on the perpetrator as someone absolutely horrible and ask themselves, 'What have we done? We just saved him.' Scroll Down for Video . Dr. Richard Wolfe explained how doctors and nurses at Boston's Beth Israel hospital battled to save Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - the teenage suspect in the city's marathon bombings . 'Some nurses started rethinking,' said New York City native Wolfe. 'They think of the mom who just lost her son, or a child with an amputation.' Talking to the New York Daily News, Wolfe added that despite these natural, but startling thoughts, every medical professional at the hospital is bound by oath to treat everyone the same - no matter what they may have done. Scroll down for more . 'You remember what we are here for, what oath we took,' said Dr. Wolfe on Wednesday. Dzokhar Tsarnaev arrived on Friday evening at the same hospital where 21-hours earlier his brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died after a gun battle with police in Watertown, Massachusetts. New pictures show dozens of bullet holes in the boat where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was hiding before giving himself up (right) Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ATF and FBI agents check Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for explosives and also give him medical attention after he was apprehended in Watertown . Seriously Injured: Dzokhar Tsarnaev is transported with multiple gunshot wounds to Beth Israel hospital in Boston where he was successfully treated . An ambulance carrying Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 19-year-old Massachusetts college student wanted in the Boston Marathon bombings, turns into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center on Friday . Dr. Wolfe was working during that admission and said that doctors and nurses treated both brothers to the best of their ability. This was despite the team having treated 24 victims of the April 15th twin bombings of the Boston marathon that killed three people and wounded more than 250 others. In fact, as Dzhokhar was being treated, several of the injured still remained in the hospital, including the mother of Martin Richard, the eight-year-old boy who died at the scene of the second blast - believed to have been caused by Dzhokhar himself. As doctors battled to save the 19-year-old, who suffered wounds to his neck, head, hands and legs, the team was watched by an especially large law enforcement contingent. Dr. Wolfe revealed that there were up to 40 people inside the resuscitation room as the teen was brought in to Beth Israel. A woman looks out of window at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center on Saturday, April 20, 2013 - the morning after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was admitted . Boston Police and Massachusetts State Police stand guard outside of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where the Boston Marathon bombing suspect, Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, is currently being held . As nine doctors and nurses worked on Dzhokhar, two officers watched and six police stood guard outside the room. 'They know how to function in a way that is remarkably unobtrusive,' said Wolfe to the New York Daily News. Survived: Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who police have taken into April 19, 2013, according to the Boston Police Department . Almost one day previously, a team from the hospital had failed to save Tamerlan Tsarnaev when he arrived already in cardiac arrest. Admitting to feeling angry at both suspects, Dr. Wolfe said his rage was piqued when he thought of Martin Richard and his family. Other staff had to battle through the disturbing sights they saw in the immediate and confused aftermath of the bombings as horrifically injured men and women were rushed in for treatment. Dr. Paul Summergrad, who is chief of psychiatry at Tufts Medical Center said that some staff were still troubled by the terrible wounds they saw. Some staff are being offered counseling in case they are suffering from post-traumatic-stress from the day. However, at the end of the day, Dr. Wolfe said that an admission suffering from multiple bullets wounds is not unusual. 'From a medical point of view, they were more like business as usual,' Wolfe said. 'Single cases, gunshot wounds — we have so many in an urban ER, you lose count.' And therefore the prognosis for Dzokhar Dr. Wolfe says is positive. 'He is young, healthy,' said Wolfe. 'We fully expect he will improve enough to be discharged from the hospital.' And this comes as one emergency doctor, Leana Wen revealed she still has nightmares from that day that leave her sleep-deprived. 'I am glad I was able to help,' said Wen. 'I wish I could have helped more. But I wish I hadn't seen it.' Unprecedented horror: Wen has spent the past four years working as an ER doctor, but says that nothing had prepared her for the gristly shrapnel injuries . The physician, a former Rhodes Scholar, fellow at Harvard Medical School and patient advocate who recently co-wrote a book about how doctors could avoid making diagnosis mistakes, is no stranger to gruesome injuries. Working in the ER for the past four years, Wen had witnessed shootings, grisly accidents and the occasional amputation, but she says that nothing had prepared her for last Monday. Dr Wen was nearing the end of her shift when a call came in about two incoming patients who were injured in an explosion. Minutes later, another call came over the PA system saying that there had been two blasts. 'There was blood everywhere,' Wen recalled the harrowing scene to USA Today. 'On the floor, there were trails of it behind the stretchers.' Sleepless city: Dr. Leana Wen is not alone in her reaction to the bombings, with many Boston residents reportedly suffering from nightmares and sleep deprivation . Although Wen had been working since 7am without a break, she told USA Today that she did not feel tired because she was running on adrenaline. The ER staff at Massachusetts General Hospital ended up treating 31 of the victims inured that day, at least four of whom required amputations. All the while, the 30-year-old medic kept triaging and treating a stream of bleeding, wounded men and women suffering from horrific shrapnel wounds the like she had never seen before. 'It was very difficult to see so many people's lives changed in one day,' she told the paper. 'Seeing all those young people who were my age, who would have very different lives moving forward, if they had lives at all.'","Dr. Richard Wolfe of Boston's Beth Israel hospital tells of the dilemma his medical staff faced in treating Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on Friday .

"Care minister Norman Lamb will announce and end to the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway on Monday . The controversial Liverpool Care Pathway is to be ‘phased out’ over the next six to 12 months after an independent review found shocking examples of abuse across the NHS. Care minister Norman Lamb will announce on Monday that the scheme, under which treatment is removed from those deemed close to death, will be scrapped. It follows a review which heard allegations that the vulnerable were being put on the pathway without consent, they were being unnecessarily sedated and that others were being denied food and water. The Neuberger inquiry also found ‘numerous examples of poor implementation and worrying standards in care’ which meant the LCP needed to be replaced. The Daily Mail has led the way in campaigning against the so-called ‘death pathway’, highlighting how hospitals were being paid ‘bribes’ by the NHS to hit targets. The Department of Health will also reveal that these incentive payments will be scrapped under whatever new system is introduced. Last night Mr Lamb vowed that the replacement will definitely not be called a ‘pathway’. He said:  ‘We need a whole new system of better end of life care tailored to the needs of individual patients and involving their families. I took the decision to launch this review because concerns were raised with me about how patients were being cared for and how families were being treated during this difficult and sensitive time.’ Every year 130,000 patients are placed on the LCP, which usually involves heavy sedation with morphine or similar drugs. The Mail has revealed that NHS trusts were receiving six-figure sums for using the end-of-life regime – leading to fears that doctors were put under pressure to use the pathway. Aintree University Hospitals Trust, in Liverpool, received £308,000 last year for achieving ‘goals including the Liverpool Care Pathway’. Part of the money was tied to it achieving an LCP figure of 43 per cent against a target of 35 per cent. Salford Royal NHS Trust had LCP-linked payments halved for failing to hit targets. Aintree University Hospitals Trust received £308,000 last year for achieving 'goals including the Liverpool Care Pathway' Salford Royal NHS Trust had LCP-linked payments halved for failing to hit targets . The report found no evidence of misuse but Mr Lamb said the ‘bribes’ give such a bad impression that they should be scrapped. Michelle Mitchell,  of the Age UK charity, said: ‘Any decision on the future of the Liverpool Care Pathway has to be based not just on what the guidance says but also on the reality of how it is being implemented. ‘As a society we must be able to ensure that people at the end of their lives are treated with compassion and dignity.’","Liverpool Care Pathway to be 'phased out' in six to 12 months .

"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie blew off on Tuesday claims by a nurse that she was treated inhumanely when she was under mandatory quarantine over the weekend for Ebola. Speculating about the possibility of a lawsuit from the nurse, Kaci Hickox, Christie said, 'Whatever. Get in line. I've been sued lots of times before. 'Get in line. I'm happy to take it on,' he added, according to CNN. Scroll down for video . Say sorry for what?: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, center, pictured here today in New Jersey, told reporters yesterday that quarantined nurse Kaci Hickox had 'access to...takeout food from the best restaurants in Newark' In this photo provided to by an attorney, quarantined nurse Kaci Hickox meets with the prominent New York civil rights attorney Norman Siegel while in an isolation tent at University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, where she was confined after flying into Newark Liberty International Airport following her work in West Africa caring for Ebola patients . Christie disputed the nurse's claims that she was mistreated and pointed out that the tent she was confined to was indoors, not outdoors, as early reports claimed. 'There's been all kinds of malarkey...about this,' Christie told reporters who trailed while on a campaign stop in Rhode Island. 'She was inside the hospital in a climate-controlled area with access to her cell phone, access to the internet, and takeout food from the best restaurants in Newark,' he said. Christie has been heavily scrutinized over his decision to keep Hickox in quarantine for several days after she tested negative for Ebola. The nurse came from West Africa by way of a New Jersey airport last week. She found herself summarily quarantined by state health officials after they detected she had a slight fever - a common symptom of Ebola. But even after the nurse's fever subsided, health officials kept her confined to a tent at a local hospital that had no shower or flushable toilet. She has obtained a high-powered civil rights lawyer to defend her in a potential lawsuit. The lawyer, Norman Siegel, told Reuters on Sunday that Hickox's quarantine raised 'serious constitutional and civil liberties issues.' The New Jersey government has since allowed Hickox to return to her home in Maine. Christie, a possible, 2016 presidential candidate, has denied that her release was an about-face, however. He has also refused to rescind the state's new policy requiring health workers returning from West Africa to self-quarantine at home for 21 days, the incubation period for Ebola. On Tuesday he maintained that he didn't think he'd done anything wrong in keeping her isolated until health officials could be sure she didn't have Ebola. 'We're trying to be careful here,' Christie said on NBC's Today show. 'This is common sense, and ... the American public believes it is common sense. And we're not moving an inch. Our policy hasn't changed, and our policy will not change.' At the campaign event later that day Christie pointed out that the Centers for Disease and Control staff who were 'on the ground in University Hospital monitoring the conditions she was in' didn't think the state treated Hickox unfairly, either. 'She had access to the Internet and we brought her takeout food,' he said. Pouncing on Christie's comment, Gawker called some of Newark's finest takeout restaurants and found that none of them delivered food to Hickox - or at least not to the restaurants' knowledge. As Christie noted New Jersey officials brought Hickox the food, so takeout restaurants may not have been away they were feeding the Ebola patient.","'I've been sued lots of times before,' Christie said flippantly .

"TV star Rustie Lee has accused a Birmingham hospital putting her mother on a Liverpool Care Pathway-style plan - after wrongly warning her family she was dying. Eugenie Edwards, 87, was admitted to City Hospital on October 13 with a chest infection. Within hours Rustie says she was told her mum had just 48 hours to live, as she was suffering from heart and kidney failure. The family were then told the grandmother-of-three was being put on a pathway plan for end-of-life patients, where medication can be reduced. Yet angry TV chef Rustie, famous for her appearances in the 1980s breakfast show TV-am, refused permission after insisting her mother was not dying - and six days later a recovered Mrs Edwards was discharged from hospital. TV star Rustie Lee has accused a Birmingham hospital putting her mother Eugenie Edwards on a Liverpool Care Pathway-style plan - after wrongly warning her family she was dying . The pensioner, who was diagnosed with dementia five years ago, is now back at her nursing home in Ladywood, Birmingham. TV cook Rustie told the Birmingham Mail: 'When I saw my mum in hospital she did seem poorly, but not as if she was about to pass away. In fact, she didn’t look close to that. 'Yet we were told she had 24 to 48 hours to live and was about to be put on this pathway. I was only told about the plan when I went over to see the nurses to ask for painkillers for my mum. I was so shocked to be told she was on some pathway. I told the doctor this was not going to happen.' Rustie says the nightmare began when her mum was rushed to the hospital from her care home with a suspected chest infection. She says she was later told the grandmother had only hours to live and she was not given food, liquid or painkillers because nurses stated she could not swallow. Just 24 hours after being admitted, relatives say they were told Mrs Edwards was being put on a Supportive Care Pathway (SCP). It is based on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP), which is designed to ease the suffering of the terminally ill in their final hours. But some families claim their relatives have been put on the LCP without their knowledge or permission - with a number making recoveries. The SCP includes cutting back medication and is also for end-of-life care, but is not deemed as harsh as the LCP. Within hours of Mrs Edwards being admitted to Birmingham City Hospital, Rustie says she was told her mother had just 48 hours to live, due to heart and kidney failure. Right: with Rustie's cousin Elaine Wray . It is currently being used in several wards at hospitals run by Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, including City Hospital. Rustie told how she and other relatives had rushed to the hospital to see her sick mother, who went on to make a dramatic improvement. 'She was on oxygen, a drip and a machine was draining liquid off her lungs,' she said. 'I was told she was unable to eat or swallow. However, when she came round I asked her if she was hungry and she said ‘yes’. 'I got a yoghurt from the nurses and fed it to her. She ate it quite easily and looked as though she could have polished off a lot more at the time. 'I stayed with her until 2am, while a cousin spent the night with her in the room. 'By the morning she was a lot brighter. I told my son to go and get her some food. He came back with sandwiches, fruit and yoghurt drinks, which she happily ate and drank. 'Afterwards she seemed so much better and was even singing and dancing in her bed. 'She had improved by 95 per cent and we definitely didn’t think she was at death’s door. She was back to her usual self.' But Rustie was left shocked by what she was allegedly told next. 'I was massaging her foot and she said it was hurting. I said I’d go and sort out some painkillers for her,' she said. 'The nurses told me that she couldn’t have any more tablets as she couldn’t swallow, but she would be put on morphine and another drug when her pain became really bad. 'I couldn’t understand why they were saying that as mum was so much better. That’s when a nurse told me they were putting her on a care pathway. I had never heard of this before.' Mrs Edwards' condition improved after she was taken off the Supportive Care Pathway. She has since been discharged from hospital . The . doctor was called and Mrs Edwards' care was discussed again with Rustie . and a family member. The former breakfast TV star said: “I told the . doctor how mum was feeling better after we had fed her, but again I was . told she was being put on a pathway. 'I said the family did not want her . to be put on this pathway and that we wanted her back at her home, as we . were not ready for her to die. We were so terrified and frightened for . her, that we didn’t leave her side.' In fact just a few hours later, on October 15, Mrs Edwards was moved to a ward and was no longer in a critical condition. 'My mum was not in so much pain that she was reeling about on the bed needing morphine,' said Rustie. 'She may have been quite ill when she was admitted, but she drastically improved and there was no need to put her on a pathway.' She added: 'We should not be allowing hospitals to put people on a pathway if they are not critically ill. By the time my mum was discharged she could walk around and was eating fine.' A City Hospital spokeswoman said: 'The Supportive Care Pathway does not mean that patients are not fed or actively treated; it is a high standard of care for people with a life-limiting illness, which has been tailor-made for use in our hospitals and the community. 'It is designed to meet a patient’s individual needs and ensures the care we give is focused on relieving symptoms and meeting a patient’s physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs. Mrs Edwards was very ill when she was admitted to our Medical Assessment Unit. 'She was put on the Supportive Care Pathway and this was explained to her family. 'Our records show that she was offered food to eat at this time. When we became aware of the family’s concerns regarding the pathway, she was taken off at their request. 'Mrs Edwards was transferred to another ward for her recovery where a senior sister and doctor again spoke to Eugenie’s family to further explain the pathway and reassure them. 'We are sorry to hear that Mrs Edwards’ family were unhappy with aspects of her care. 'Our aim is to address concerns when they happen, however, if the family feel they would like more clarification we are more than happy for them to contact us to discuss this further.'","Eugenie Edwards, 87, admitted to .

"Ex-soldier: Brian Witty, a former captain in the parachute regiment, is accused of raping three women and sexually assaulting another . A city banker accused of being a serial rapist told one of his alleged victims when she picked him on a dating website: ‘It’s your lucky day’. But instead of meeting the man of her dreams, the woman was reduced to tears after allegedly being attacked in an alleyway. Brian Witty, 41, a former captain in the Parachute Regiment, is alleged to have carried out three rapes and a sexual assault over a 16-year period. Despite being arrested after each of the first three alleged attacks, he was only charged after the fourth woman made a complaint against him. None of his alleged victims had ever met each other, a court heard. Questioned why four women had reported him to police, Witty told jurors: ‘I was a poor judge of character.’ He also claimed that his accusers ‘must have a screw loose’. Kingston-upon-Thames Crown  Court in south London heard Witty had a ‘compulsive’ need for sex after only a few hours with women. Jurors were told that when Witty was rebuffed by the first woman in 1995, he jumped out of bed and said: ‘But I’m a good looking bloke.’ He allegedly told Miss A, a nanny he met in the Slug and Lettuce, Fulham, that ‘No means yes’ when she refused his advances in his former flat in Kensington, even after she replied: ‘No definitely means no.’ After falling asleep with her clothes on, she claims she awoke to find Witty ‘painfully’ forcing her to have sex. In 2006, the financier is alleged to have ‘forcefully’ sexually assaulted recruitment consultant Miss B in a Covent Garden alleyway after a drunken date arranged through the website datingdirect.com. He had previously emailed the 25-year-old to say picking him was her ‘lucky day’ and promised her ‘all day laughter’. But the court heard she was in tears when she arrived home later that night. City watering hole: Abacus, a bar on Cornhill, next to the Royal Exchange in the Square Mile, where Witty claimed to have made eye contact with an alleged victim as she ate chicken 'suggestively' Dating Direct: Witty described to the court how he met Miss D, another alleged victim, through this online matchmaking service . In 2008, he dated Miss C, who he met . by chance in the Pitcher and Piano pub in the City after he saw her . ‘suggestively’ eating a chicken skewer. A few days later they met up, and . Witty allegedly raped her in his riverside flat where the court heard he . keeps his toy soldier collection. Edmund Gritt, prosecuting, has told . jurors that during the alleged attack Witty grabbed Miss C’s wrists and . said ‘he had been in the army, was still a trainer and could do whatever . he wanted, even kill her’ and called her an ‘African ****’. Witty, originally from Hull, was . finally charged after Miss D, a blonde 42-year-old oil company worker he . met through the same website, alleged she was raped by him at his flat. During a meeting in The Anglers, a . riverside pub in Teddington, south London, he allegedly told Miss D ‘he . had been in the Parachute Regiment and had killed people.’ Back at his . flat, he forced Miss D to have sex – and she fled the flat ‘shaking and . crying’ and immediately told police who arrested Witty within . two-and-a-half hours. 'Flash': Witty claimed Miss D exposed her breasts to him in the bar of this pub in Teddington, Middlesex, before returning with him to his house for sex . The previous cases against Witty, a director at City firm Marsh were then re-opened. In a police interview he said: ‘Once . I’ve had sex, sometimes if I don’t see the future in that I can be quite . unemotional ... I really do believe that my mistake, if any mistake, is . one of thinking with my **** and then you know I’m paying for it later . ... some ladies get very upset.’ Edmund Gritt, prosecuting, reminded . Witty about comments made to police when the first two women had accused . him. ‘In 2006 your view of Miss B, as you . said in your interview was “she must have a screw loose”. That was what . you said in 1995 ... “she’s got a bloody screw loose”.’ Witty, wearing a grey pinstripe suit, white shirt and blue tie agreed he had made the comments to police. 'I think she had a screw loose': In his defence, Witty told Kingston Crown Court that he 'must have a poor judge of character' for ending up with women who subsequently accused him of attacking them . Mr Gritt also asked him whether he considered ‘getting to know people better’ before having sex with them. Witty said: ‘That’s a ridiculous . thing to say. I’ve not done anything wrong, I’ve not raped or sexually . assaulted anyone, why should I go and think about what I do? That just . doesn’t make sense.’ Asked if he wondered why women ‘make . false accusations against him’, Witty said: ‘I wasn’t living my life . around why people were doing these things, so no.’ He added: ‘Obviously I was a poor judge of character, if that’s what you want me to say.’ The father-of-two, of Teddington, south London, denies three rapes and one charge of sexual assault between 1995 and 2011. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Brian Witty, 41, tells jurors he 'must have a poor judge of character'

And visitors eager for a glimpse of their seemingly happy faces have been shocked to find what looks like eyes are in fact gills. Curator Christine Pitcher said: 'We took more ray eggs out of our main display tank this morning, and at least 20 of them seem to be fertile. 'It’s the right time of year for a baby boom, but I don’t recall ever having so many youngsters appearing at once before. The miniature rays might appear to be smiling but in fact what looks like eyes are in fact tiny gills . A closer look at the 'face' reveals that there are no eyes on the underside of the tiny fish - there are on the upper side of the flat fish . 'It’s the ultimate endorsement for our husbandry techniques and the quality of water and theming in our displays,' she added. Though . the fish appear to be smiling, what looks to be it’s eyes are in fact . gills for breathing on it’s underside. The rays' real eyes are on the . front of it’s body. The fish will live in a nursery tank until they are big enough to join the adult rays in huge open top tank. Staff at the Sea Life Centre are delighted with the sudden arrival of so many newborn rays, and are hoping the baby boom will extend to the centre's nurse shark which they have been trying to mate . Thornbacked rays are the most common of nine species of rays in British waters. They can grow up to 1.2metres. They get their name because their upper body is covered in tiny prickles. Christine and her team are hoping the . baby boom will rub off on their largest resident Aphropdite the nurse . shark who has been mating with male Hercules. 'That would certainly be the ""happy event"" of the year,' she said. Disguised: The tiny thornback rays will eventually look like this one, brown and speckled on top, where their real eyes are clearly visible .","Six tiny thornback rays have hatched at Great Yarmouth Sea Life Centre, Norfolk, in the last three days during a 'baby boom'

"A notorious rapist walking the streets of Britain has been granted anonymity by a judge as he uses human rights laws to dictate to the authorities where he wants to live. The violent sex attacker is using Article 8 of the Human Rights Act to demand that he be allowed to move from England, where he committed his crime, to another part of the UK. But even before the case has been heard, a judge has thrown a cloak of secrecy over proceedings following an application by his lawyers. Anonymous: The rapist has been granted anonymity by the courts before proceedings start . They have obtained a strict court order banning the Press from telling the public who he is, or giving any detail which might identify him. The man, whose identity is known to the Daily Mail, raped a woman after breaking into her house armed with a knife. He was sentenced to more than a decade behind bars but released after serving half his sentence. Like other prisoners ‘on licence’ he must remain in a particular place and report to the Probation Service. He applied to the Ministry of Justice to be allowed to move from England to another part of the UK, where he is originally from and where his family now live. When the authorities refused, he launched a legal appeal under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, the right to a private and family life. His case is thought to be funded by legal aid. Judges have granted the convicted sex offender anonymity following an application by his lawyers . A full hearing in the case will take place this week. A court order made by High Court judge Mr Justice Underhill said nothing should be printed which could reveal who he is and what he did. The judge did not make clear his reasons for imposing the order, other than to note a claim by the rapist’s lawyer that naming him would have an impact on his family. He said: ‘I do … accept that, given the apparent particular Press interest in the case, the issue of anonymisation is best determined in advance of the substantive hearing. I have directed accordingly. ‘I have provided for preliminary anonymisation but it must be understood that that may not be continued at or after the hearing.’ Tory MP Priti Patel called for a review to ensure anonymity is not given too easily to ‘such despicable individuals’. She said: ‘The first point to make is that clearly secret justice in this case is showing utter disregard for the victim of this appalling crime. Yet again we are seeing the criminal justice system on the side of the offender and not the victim.’","Raped woman at knifepoint in her own home .

"A newly-revealed 911 call today shed light on a dispute between soccer star Hope Solo and her fiancé on the night before their wedding, which went on as planned despite the melee. The November 13 fracas in Solo's Washington state home resulted in the arrest of former NFL player Jerramy Stevens, but the charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence. Shortly after his release from jail, the couple married - a mere two months after they started dating. Scroll down for audio . Trouble in paradise? A newly-revealed 911 call has shed some light on a dispute between soccer star Hope Solo and her fiance Jerramy Stevens on the night before their wedding, which went on as planned despite the melee . The caller told the dispatcher that he was Marcus Solo, Hope's brother, and and asked that officers respond to her home, where a pre-wedding party appeared to have taken a violent turn. The recording of the 911 call was revealed last night by KOMO News. At the beginning of the call, he says: 'There was a little fight inside the house and she got thrown to the ground and she might have dislocated her hip,' referring to a female party guest who wasn't his sister. When asked if any weapons were used in the fight, Marcus Solo said: 'A stun gun, actually.' He adds that many of the people in the home had been drinking alcohol. Marcus Solo, however, never identifies Stevens - or anyone else - as the aggressor in the fight. When pressed about the person who started it all, he replies: 'We won't go there. Please get here.' Police have previously said that Marcus used . a 'stun gun' to fight off a group of men who had not been invited to . the party. When cops arrived, Solo was said to have been left nursing a cut elbow following the altercation. Others in the home suffered minor injuries. 'Happy as can be': Hope Solo posted this picture of herself with husband Jerramy Stevens on WhoSay on Thursday . At work: Solo practices with the national team in Portland on Tuesday ahead of a game against Ireland . Stevens was found hiding in a bedroom by . police, lying between a bed and the wall. He claimed to have been . sleeping and unaware of the fight, but his story crumbled as officers discovered dried blood . on his shirt. He was  arrested for fourth-degree domestic violence assault after admitting he had fought with Solo. An officer reported: 'He and his fiancée . Hope had an argument about whether they would be living in Florida or . Washington after their marriage.' A judge determined there wasn't . enough evidence to hold Stevens and he was released, but the matter . remained under investigation. Hours later, Solo and Stevens were . married. The couple wed at a farm . near Snohomish, Washington state, in a ceremony that Solo's aunt Kathleen . Shaw called 'beautiful'. Busted: Hope Solo's new husband Jerramy Stevens has been arrested for violating the terms of his probation . Her teammate Jillian Loyden, a backup goalkeeper to Hope on the U.S. National women's soccer team, was also a guest and tweeted: 'Happy to . witness such an amazing celebration of real love.' Solo herself uploaded a picture of her . and her new husband in Seattle the day after the wedding, with Stevens . clearly wearing his gold wedding band. She spoke out about her relationship after a workout with her teammates in Portland, Oregon. The U.S. soccer star has since maintained that her husband never hit her. 'I'm happy,' Solo insisted. 'I'm happily married. I would never stand for domestic violence. I've never been hit in my . life... My life is great.' Stevens, 33, was arrested again at his Tampa, Florida, home - a day after the wedding - for violating  probation - stemming from a marijuana possession charge brought in October 2010. A Florida Department of Corrections . spokesperson told NWCN that Stevens' probation had allowed him to travel to . Washington state, where he married Solo, as long as he did not get arrested. Although the charges were later . dropped, simply being arrested allowed a violation of his probation in Florida, the spokesperson told the news channel.. The probation stems from an arrest in October 2010, when he was playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was busted near the team's hotel after an officer found marijuana in a bag alongside his equipment, and he was placed on probation until October 2013. Wedding day: The couple married in Washington state on November 13 after just two months of dating . Together: Solo, pictured with Stevens before Halloween, insisted that she had never been hit in her life . Couple: She started dating Stevens after the London Games, where she scored another gold medal . Solo has had a stellar career with the national team, helping the team to two straight Olympic gold medals. Stevens himself also enjoyed a . successful sports career at University of Washington. He was the No. 28 pick of the 2002 draft by the Seattle Seahawks. His best season with the Seahawks was in . 2005 when he started a career-high 12 games and had 45 receptions as the . team won the NFC championship. But he also was involved in incidents away from football . that included reckless driving charges for crashing into a nursing home. He and Solo, who also attended Washington, started dating following the London Games. 'Like I said, we're happy, and ultimately that's all that matters,' she said. Arrest: The former NFL player, right, appeared in court on November 13 but the charges were dropped . Support: Solo also appeared in court to support her fiance, whom she married just hours later . Dispatcher: 'What's going on today?' Marcus: 'There was a little fight inside the house and she got thrown to the ground and she might have dislocated her hip.' Dispatcher: 'OK, any weapons involved in the fight?' Marcus: 'Umm… A stun gun, actually.' Dispatcher: 'OK, hold on. How many people are there?' Marcus: 'There's about a half-dozen, not more.' Operator: 'About a half dozen?' Marcus: At least… Eight maybe?' Dispatcher: 'Was the fight physical other than the stun gun?' Marcus: 'There was definitely a physical altercation and an innocent bystander got hurt.' Dispatcher: 'OK, and who was the person who was the instigator?' Marcus: 'We won't go there. Please get here.' Dispatcher: 'All the parties that were fighting, are they separated?' Marcus: 'Yes, ma'am.' Dispatcher: 'Are all of them still there?' Marcus: 'I don't know.' Dispatcher: 'Anybody using drugs or alcohol today?' Marcus: 'Alcohol, definitely.' Operator: 'And, the female - where is she located?' Marcus: 'She’s here.' Operator: 'Ok, but in living room, bedroom?' Marcus:  'In the living room area, dining room.' Dispatcher: 'What did this start over?' Marcus: 'I don't know.' Operator: 'Sir?'

"What do you call a sheep with two faces? That's the conundrum a Kiwi farming family has contended with since they discovered one of their ewes had given birth to a baby lamb with the unique deformity last Friday. 'I've tried to think of a name for it but it's so unique that nothing really fits,' said farmer Justine Parker, from Slope Point Farms, near Invercargill at the southernmost point of New Zealand's South Island. One North Island radio station suggested they call it U2. But the family appears to have settled on a name thought up by Ms Parker's little girls, Anna, 10, and Sarah, 8, and Kate, 6. Two of everything! The family of Justine Parker and Andrew Wilson, who live near Invercargill at the southernmost point of New Zealand, have taken to calling the lamb 'Two Face'. Adored: Anna Parker, 10, Sarah Parker, 8 and Kate Wilson, 6, have taken a liking to the little lamb. 'My wee girls just called it Two Face,' Ms Parker told Daily Mail Australia. With four eyes, two noses and two mouths, Two Face is a little different from the rest of the flock. But after the initial surprise of discovering the little lamb with 'two of everything', Two Face has fast become one of the family's favourite farm animals. 'We really care for him like one of our own now,' Ms Parker said. Rugged up! Ms Parker said: 'We really care for (Two Face) like one of our own.' Cuddles! The children with Two Face, the lamb with 'two of everything'. Two Face's deformities have only caused him a few issues. He tilts slightly to the left when he walks and has some difficult feeding. But Ms Parker said Two Face appears to be a happy lamb who interacts with the other farm animals like normal. 'He's just a bit of a dude,' she said. Farmers often encounter deformed lambs, but it's rare for them to live this long. 'We do know - and the kids know - it's not going to live forever,' Ms Parker told Daily Mail Australia. 'But for it to live this long is a bit of a miracle really.'","New Zealand farming family discover baby lamb with two faces .

"Wayne Rooney is fit for the Manchester derby this weekend. Rooney gave Manchester United a scare on Monday when he limped away from Carrington after training. However, it is understood that the United captain trained fully on Wednesday and will play at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has been suspended since his red against West Ham last month . Rooney will return for the Manchester derby after serving a three-game suspension . Rooney has not played since last month after serving a three-game ban for a sending-off against West Ham. United manager Louis van Gaal has told Rooney he will definitely start and it remains to be seen who makes way. Robin van Persie could be the one to suffer after a series of indifferent performances, despite scoring a late equaliser against Chelsea at Old Trafford last Sunday. Meanwhile, former United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel now believes Manchester City are a ‘bigger club’ than their local rivals based on recent form. During his eight years at Old Trafford, Schmeichel did not lose one Manchester derby and United were undoubtedly superior to City. Rooney was seen limping after attending a sponsorship event for Bulova watches at Old Trafford . But the 50-year-old thinks the balance of power has well and truly shifted in City’s favour. ‘In my first couple of years at United I didn’t understand the rivalry with City. Liverpool and Leeds were much bigger,’ Schmeichel told BBC Sport. ‘Now it’s different. Man City are the champions, they won their second Premier League title last season and maybe at the moment they are a bigger club than Manchester United in terms of results so the significance has changed.’ The Champions League winner is still very much a United fan, though, and admits playing against Sir Alex Ferguson’s team in City blue was a ‘very weird’ experience. Like many other United supporters, Schmeichel has become concerned by the inconsistency shown by the team since Ferguson retired. ‘The derby is a tricky one for United because of their inconsistency,’ he said. ‘We don’t know what we will get on Sunday.’ Schmeichel shouts instructions to the outfield players during a match for Manchester City .

"Tragic: Lynsey Popp was left to die alone in the wreckage of her fiance's car who fled the scene and went home to bed . A drink-driver left his bride-to-be to die alone in the wreckage of a car crash and went home to bed. Instead of calling for help, drunken fiance Ceiron Cook, 36, fled the scene leaving Lynsey Popp, 28, on her own. Passing motorists were horrified when they discovered Miss Popp's lifeless body in the passenger seat of the car which had crashed into a tree. Police and paramedics were called but mother-of-two Miss Popp was already dead. The court heard when Cook was woken hours later his 'slurred' words were: 'Where's Lynsey? Is she okay?' Charity worker Cook had taken 'love of his life' Lynsey for a late-night drive on icy roads in January when the tragedy happened. Prosecutor Rachel Knight said: 'Lynsey was in the front passenger seat of the Honda Civic car being driven by her partner and the man she intended to marry. 'The car smashed into a tree but instead of calling the emergency services Cook ran off leaving her dead or dying. 'It was not until some time later that the crashed car was discovered by two passers by who raised the alarm. 'They noticed the car was cold and that there was nobody in the driver's seat. 'But to their horror they saw there was a passenger. 'She was removed from the car and taken to hospital but it was clear that she had died at the scene.' The court heard Cook was an uninsured provisional licence holder with a record of driving while disqualified and uninsured. Cook blamed snow and ice for causing the accident on a country road near Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. Close: The family of Lynsey Popp say they may have forgiven Cook if he had stayed with his daughter . The court heard he had met 'happy and smiling' Lynsey 10-months earlier and the pair were making marriage plans. Jailed: Ceiron Cook crashed his car after being over the alcohol limit. He left his fiancee to die in the wreckage and fled the scene . Lucy Crowther, defending, said: 'The harsh reality is that he does not care how long he receives in prison because as far as he is concerned he will never be able to forgive himself. 'This was somebody who he loved more than anyone else in the world and he has killed her. 'There were questions about why it was that he ran. 'When one knows the condition in which he was found the first thing that he said was where's Lynsey. 'Perhaps that goes to show the limited degree of functioning that he had at that time. 'It was not to try and not to help Lynsey because that's what he wanted above all. He was determined to make her a happy wife.' Cook, of Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, was jailed for four years after admitting causing death by careless driving while over the alcohol limit. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard he had 124 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit is 80. He had also been smoking cannabis on the night of the crash on January 25. Cook spent four days in hospital after suffering a broken shoulder, fractured ribs, fractured cheekbone and ruptured spleen. Miss Popp suffered horrific injuries, including a fractured skull and laceration to the carotid artery. Her devastated family told the court they could have forgiven Cook if he had stayed with her. Helen Popp recalled the exact time she discovered her step-daughter was dead. Heartbroken: Lynsey with her father Colin who said Cook should have stayed with his daughter . She said: 'It was 5.24am and it is the worse news of anyone's life to tell your husband that his daughter has been killed.' Cook, who had just started a business exporting clothes to developing countries, was disqualified from driving for five years. Judge Richard Twomlow: 'It would seem that Lynsey died instantly. 'No words I can say or sentence I can pass can alleviate the loss and distress felt by her family.' Miss Popp had a daughter Libby, nine, and son Thomas, six. Her father Colin Popp, 49, said after the case: 'We accept that Ceiron Cook is remorseful. 'He will have to get up every day and know that he has killed someone. But four years for a life does not fit the crime. 'He still could have stayed with her. If you loved somebody you would stay. 'We could have forgiven him if he had not left her or called an ambulance.'","Ceiron Cook was over the alcohol limit and had been smoking cannabis on the night of the crash .

"Struck by an overwhelming sense of nausea, Gemma Armstrong thought she was suffering a bout of food poisoning. Returning from work last Monday the 19-year-old made a dash for the bathroom. But rather than a nasty case of gastroenteritis, the teenager was shocked to be in the early stages of labour. Miss Armstrong, from Alness, Ross-Shire, Scotland, had no idea she was pregnant. She developed no tell-tale bump and just a month before giving birth to her surprise daughter Orla, the teenager had worn a bikini on a beach holiday in Malta - where partner Daniel Degan works. Scroll down for video . Gemma Armstrong gave birth on the bathroom floor - after having no idea she was pregnant and believing she was suffering from food poisoning. Here, she is pictured with daugher Orla Degan . With her partner Daniel Degan abroad, Miss Armstrong turned to his mother Katrina and sister Eilidh. The pair delivered their granddaughter and niece on the bathroom floor of their Alness home. Miss Armstrong said: 'I had absolutely no idea. 'I made Sunday dinner the night before and was up all night with sickness and thought I had given myself food poisoning. Ms Janet Fyle, of the Royal College of Midwives said although Miss Armstrong’s situation is uncommon, it is not unusual. She said: ‘Some women just don’t know they are pregnant . ‘One lady was serving in Afghanistan and didn’t realise she was pregnant, and we had to send services out there. ‘It might happen for a variety of reasons. It’s different for any women. ‘There are some women with good abdominal muscles and fat and the baby lies flat against the back so they don’t have a bump. ‘Some women won’t have the normal pregnancy symptoms. ‘Some women feel the baby moving inside them, but some don’t. ‘A lot of the symptoms of pregnancy are ‘everyday’ symptoms. So they might not know that having wind is a sign of pregnancy. Especially if they’ve never had a baby.’ ‘Not all women are body-conscious. It depends on what’s going on in their life.’ In these cases, the midwife has an important role in supporting the new family, as adjusting to being a parents can be a shock. She said: ‘The women themselves are totally shocked when it happens to them. ‘A lot of talking and reassurance by the midwife is needed. ‘They need to say the occurrence is unusual but the woman herself is not abnormal. ‘That woman is going to need a lot of help and support adjusting to being a parent. ‘Women with unplanned pregnancies get very upset, so imagine one day you have a normal life and the next you are a parent. ‘The midwife would give that woman a lot more care, watching for signs of post-natal depression or even post-natal unhappiness.’ 'I went to work on Monday morning, came back at 5pm, went to the toilet and that is when my partner's mother realised that I was having a baby and she delivered her on the bathroom floor with the help of my partner's sister.' Mr Degan flew home immediately after receiving a call to say he had become a father. Miss Armstrong described the two-hour labour as a 'real family effort'. Ms Degan helped her throughout, and his sister  cut the umbilical cord. A paramedic team arrived at the Degan's home for 'the last little push', but as far as Miss Armstrong is concerned, Ms Degan was her chief midwife. Orla, who weighed 7lbs 9oz, was perfectly healthy when she was born. Mother and baby were taken to hospital for a check-up and spent two nights on the maternity ward while experts monitored their progress. 'The paramedics took us in because it was such a shock for everyone,' Miss Armstrong said. 'I did everything you're not supposed to do when you're pregnant,' she explained . Two months before giving birth she enjoyed a trip to Alton Towers Theme Park and flew on holiday just a month before her daughter's arrival. 'I had no big bump, I was in a bikini on the beach in Malta a month ago,' she said. Although still in shock, Miss Armstrong and partner Mr Degan, 24, have fallen in love with their first child, who they call their 'little surprise'. She described her baby as 'perfect', adding she just sleeps and eats and only wakes twice in the night. 'I just sit and stare at her, everyone is so delighted,' she said. Miss Armstrong announced the birth of her daughter on her Facebook page as the 'best and most surprising case of food poisoning in the world. Not the toilet trip I expected'. Mr Degan had planned to come home from Malta early as a surprise on November 19. But Miss Armstrong said she got her surprise in first with the arrival of Orla on November 17. Miss Armstrong announced the birth of her daughter on her Facebook page as the 'best and most surprising case of food poisoning in the world'. Here she is pictured, right, with baby Orla, centre her partner Daniel Degan, 24, also centre, and her partner's mother Katrina Degan, who delivered the baby . They have been overwhelmed by the generosity of friends and family, they said. 'She is a little celebrity,' Miss Armstrong said. 'Everybody seems to know about Orla and everybody has been so good to us, it's amazing. 'We had nothing for a baby as people usually have nine months to prepare and we didn't even have nine hours, but now we have everything as we have had so many presents.' Miss Armstrong was lucky enough not to worry about telling her work colleagues that she had to take last-minute maternity leave as her father is the boss of the company. 'I'm so lucky as I probably would've got my P45 anywhere else,' she quipped.","Gemma Armstrong, 19 went to the toilet believing she had food poisoning .

"The overweight should be prescribed Weight Watchers on the  NHS, according to the health watchdog. GPs will be told to offer the 12-week slimming courses – which typically cost £100 – to patients. With the UK having the second highest rates of obesity in Europe, the plan is likely to cost hundreds of millions of pounds. Weight watchers: GPs will be told to offer the 12-week courses which typically cost £100 to patients . And the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence is advising doctors to consider referring patients who are only ‘overweight’ as well as those who are ‘obese’. Around a quarter of adults in the UK are classed as obese and a further 40 per cent are overweight. But experts say that even if patients lose only a small amount of weight, it could save the NHS money by drastically cutting their risk of developing diabetes, heart disease and some cancers. The NHS currently spends an estimated £5.1billion a year treating obesity-related illnesses. The new guidelines from NICE urge GPs to raise the issue of weight loss in a ‘respectful’ and ‘non-judgmental’ way. They say that courses such as Weight . Watchers and Slimming World are a cost-effective way of combating . soaring obesity rates, and claim that even if patients lose less than a . stone, it will save money by reducing the number who go on to develop . serious illnesses. And although GPs have been told to . prioritise those with long-term health conditions such as type 2 . diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease, the guidelines say . family doctors should also consider referring patients who are just . overweight as well as obese. As . well as an estimated £5.1billion a year treating obesity-related . illnesses, the NHS also spends £10billion a year dealing with the . complications of type 2 diabetes. The NHS already pays for obese patients . to go to slimming classes and spends an estimated £800,000 a year on . Weight Watchers alone. But the new guidance is likely to lead to many more being referred. Figures . show patients attending Weight Watchers and similar sessions manage to . lose only 3 per cent of their body weight. NICE says even this small . amount will benefit health. Nutritionist . Carol Weir, who helped draw up the NICE guidance, said: ‘Losing as . little as 3 per cent … will have benefits in the long term as long as . that weight is kept off for several years.’ But . campaigners questioned how the NHS would be able to pay for all the . courses and raised doubts over their effectiveness in the long-term. Obesity . expert Dr Ian Campbell said: ‘The vast majority of existing weight-loss . companies don’t offer significant support to achieve behavioural . change, nor do they have evidence of long-term results.’ And . Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum said: ‘The NHS is in such a . parlous position that it will not be able to fund all the programmes . needed.’ NICE says that if . someone with a body mass index of 35 lost 5 per cent of their weight, . they would typically add two to four years to their life. This is equivalent to a woman who is 5ft 6in and 13 stone losing just over two stone. And the benefits are even greater for more obese patients – someone with a BMI of 40 who lost 5 per cent of weight could live between eight and ten years longer. Not all obese patients will be automatically referred, as it will depend on funds available.","12-week programmes to be offered to 'obese' and 'overweight' patients .

"Landlady: Yvonne Mosquito owns a house on Benefits Street, it has emerged . After Channel 4 lifted the lid on the crime and grime of Benefits Street,  it might not come as a shock to hear that the area is of quite some interest to the police. But surprisingly, one high-ranking member of the force is not there to deal out justice – instead she saw the road as the perfect place to expand her property portfolio. Yvonne Mosquito, Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for the West Midlands, snapped up number 95 James Turner Street in Birmingham back in 2002, it emerged yesterday. Mrs Mosquito, 49, and her 57-year-old husband Winston paid £30,000 for the property, which neighbours claim is now empty. The two-bedroom terraced house, which has increased in value to around £88,000, sits just yards away from the petty criminals and recovering drug addicts who live in the crime-ridden area. It is located in the middle of the city’s deprived Winson Green suburb, and the street is currently the subject of a controversial five-part observational documentary which set out to examine the everyday lives of its inhabitants. Living only a few doors away are some of the ‘stars’ of the series – which has shown residents being threatened with eviction, drinking strong lager in the street  and discussing breaking into a delivery driver’s van in order to steal his sat nav. The property is close to the ramshackle address of self-confessed alcoholic and recovering drug addict James Clarke, 44, who is referred to by his nickname, Fungi, on the programme. Scroll down for video . Investigated: Mark Thomas, who admitted fiddling his benefits on the show, is led from his house on James Turner Street by police . Mess: A resident shown by a pile of rubbish left on the street, but Dee maintains it is a 'clean street' During the first episode of Benefits Street he was filmed as he swindled well-meaning shoppers out of small change by selling them fake copies of the Big Issue in Birmingham city centre. Some of the other neighbours living close by include Mark Thomas and Becky Howe, both 23, who openly joked about fiddling their benefits claims in the first episode of the show. All the more surprising then that Mrs Mosquito, who earns £65,000 a year and is currently enjoying a holiday cruise in the Caribbean, would want to put down roots in such an insalubrious part of town. The house is by no means the only piece of the police chief’s property empire. According to her register of interests she also owns land in Winson Green, another plot of land in the city’s Highgate area – and has bought a £450,000, six-bedroom house on the outskirts of upmarket Sutton Coldfield. Mrs Mosquito, whose second role as the Labour councillor representing Bimingham’s Nechells ward comes with an annual salary of £16,267, has also seen two of her children get on the property ladder at the tender age of just 19 and 22. Last year they inherited a five-bedroom property in Jamaica where Mrs Mosquito’s parents were born.

It is unclear whether the James Turner Street property was inhabited when Benefits Street was being filmed between October 2012 and October last year. However records show that Simeon Mosquito, 31, thought to be Mr Mosquito’s son from an earlier relationship, was formerly registered as living at the house – and the property has since been let out to other tenants. Last night a woman who answered the door at her detached house in sought-after Streetly in Sutton Coldfield said only: ‘Yvonne isn’t here. ‘She’s on holiday in the Caribbean on a cruise.’ The programme has attracted its fair share of controversy, with some of the people filmed for the show claiming they were ‘duped’ into taking part in what they were told would be about the street’s ‘close-knit community’.

"Blackburn, Leeds and Nottingham Forest will all have a transfer ban for the January window after breaching the Football League's financial fair play (FFP) rules. The League announced that the three clubs all incurred financial losses more than the £8million permitted during last season. Submissions from QPR, Leicester and Burnley - who were all promoted to the Premier League - plus the three clubs relegated last season will now be considered by the Football League. Nottingham Forest's Stuart Pearce will be unable to sign players this season unless certain criteria are met . Leeds, pictured in action against Fulham, have also been hit with an FFP embargo by the Football League . Blackburn were given the same punishment after making more than £8million in losses last season . A statement said: 'An initial analysis of FFP submissions from the current 24 Championship clubs has indicated that three clubs - Blackburn Rovers, Leeds United and Nottingham Forest - have failed to meet the fair play requirement under the division's FFP rules. 'Consequently, all three will be subject to an ""FFP embargo"" under Football League regulations from January 1, 2015 for the remainder of the current campaign.' Under the transfer embargoes, the three clubs will be prohibited from signing any new players - either on a permanent or loan deal - unless they have 24 or fewer 'established players', which is described as 24 players aged 21 or over that have made at least five starts for the club. Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino has been disqualified by the Football League and asked to resign . Michail Antonio (left) is unlikely to be joined by any new signings at Nottingham Forest in January . Blackburn owners Balaji Rao (left) and Venkatesh Rao saw their club make over £8m in losses in 2013-14 . Blackburn's managing director Derek Shaw said in a statement: 'Whilst the ruling will clearly present some difficulties, we will of course respect the rules of the Football League. 'A lot of effort and hard work has been done to reduce player costs over the last two years, but we have wanted to rebuild and challenge in this division at the same time, and we will continue to do that.' The clubs will have their embargoes lifted at the end of the season if they can demonstrate they have stayed within the maximum permitted losses of £6million - £3m losses plus £3m covered by shareholder investment - for the current season. Clubs will be prohibited from registering any new professional players (permanent contract or loan) unless they have: . • 24 or fewer established players (players aged 21 or over that have made at least 5 starting appearances for the club). Where clubs have fewer than 24 established players, they will only be permitted to sign players in the following circumstances (with the player in question being added to the club's list of established players regardless of his age or previous playing experience): . • Where the employee costs of a player being signed are less than £600,000 per annum (or pro-rata if signed on a shorter contract). Where clubs have 24 established players, they will be permitted to trade on a 'one out, one in' basis but only if the employee costs of the player coming in to the club are no more than whichever is the lower amount of: . • 75 per cent of the equivalent costs of the player going out. • Or a maximum of £600,000 per annum (or pro-rata if signed on shorter contract) In addition: . • Clubs under an FFP embargo will be permitted to sign a goalkeeper on an emergency basis (in line with existing regulations). • Clubs under an FFP embargo will not be permitted to pay transfer fees or compensation fees for professional players. • Clubs under an FFP embargo will not be permitted to pay a loan fee to another club, they may only pay the player's wage (or a contribution towards it). • For incoming players, clubs can only pay agents' fees as a benefit in kind to the player in question (as long as they do not exceed the £600,000 employee costs limit).","The Championship trio will be unable to sign players from January 1 2015 .

"A Turkish Airlines pilot inadvertently sparked widespread panic after he triggered a hijack alarm during a flight from Frankfurt to Istanbul. Fearing the plane had been commandeered by terrorists, Austria’s military deployed two fighter jets to escort the Boeing 737 to Vienna International Airport. The incident occurred Friday afternoon after the pilot requested permission to divert to Vienna and make an emergency landing. A Turkish Airlines pilot activated a hijack alarm after the plane was hit by a pressurisation problem . The plane's oxygen masks descended from the ceiling when there was a problem with the cabin pressure . According to authorities, the error was coupled with a depressurization warning and then unexplained radio silence from the cockpit. The passenger plane had been flying from Frankfurt to Istanbul when panicked passengers saw oxygen masks fall from the ceiling after it was hit by a pressurisation problem. Two fighter jets escorted the plane until it made an emergency landing in Vienna . Flight radar data show that the plane was flying over the Alps when it changed course and flew to Vienna. The pilot - who had asked to make an emergency landing - apparently inadvertently activated the hijack alarm as he responded to the problem, police said. Authorities stepped down from their hijack alert status approximately 40 minutes after flight TK1618 landed without incident, according to the Kurier newspaper.","Incident began when plane was hit by a pressurisation problem .

"President Barack Obama saluted a pair of United States Marines on Tuesday while holding what appeared to be a styrofoam cup in his saluting hand, a breach of military regulations that won't win him fans among veterans and servicemen. Obama is known for drinking tea, not coffee, when he travels, especially before delivering speeches. His quasi-saluting gesture was an instant embarrassment for the White House, and not because his environmentally taboo drinkware clashed with the green-policy speech he was on his way to deliver at a UN Climate Summit. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Americans weren't amused after the White House posted a short video clip showing the commander-in-chief casually saluting a pair of US Marines while holding a drink . Americans, including those who have served in uniform, reacted harshly on Twitter after Obama's salute faux pas . JUDGMENT: With no news photographers catching the embarrassing moment, some are scratching their heads about why the White House published the video clip on its own . Saluting military personnel is something presidents are expected to do since they're at the top of the Pentagon's chain of command. It's customary for a commander-in-chief to salute uniformed servicemen and women who salute him first as a sign of respect. President Ronald Reagan reportedly began the tradition and future presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, followed suit. But Obama's casual approach to the moment as he left his Marine One chopper at a helipad in New York City came at a time when he had just ordered U.S. fighter planes to fly perilous missions in the skies over Syria. Twitter predictably erupted, with most commenters expressing outrage and a few insisting that it wasn't a major mistake. Arriving: Marine One lands in New York City (above) as President Obama heads to deliver remarks at the United Nations Climate Summit . Keynote:President Obama (above) called on everyone in the international community to cut their carbon pollution during his speech . Real estate mogul and long-time Obama critic Donald Trump weighed in on the controversy, proclaiming the president's coffee cup salute 'terrible' in response to a tweet from one of his followers. The 'Customs and Courtesies' manual of the U.S. Marine Corps advises that there are circumstances in which it's not appropriate to render a salute. One of them is when military personnel are 'carrying articles with both hands or being otherwise so occupied as to make saluting impractical.' A Yahoo News reporter mocked the president, speculating on the Starbucks size of his salute . His two cents: In response to a tweet from one of his followers about the coffee cup salute, Donald Trump proclaimed Obama's faux pas 'terrible!' U.S. Army Field Manual: . 'Raise the right hand sharply, fingers and thumb extended and joined, palm facing down, and ... touch the tip of the right forefinger to the forehead near and slightly to the right of the right eyebrow.' U.S. Marine 'Customs and Courtesies' 'In some situations, the salute is not appropriate. In general, do not salute when ... carrying articles with both hands or being otherwise so occupied as to make saluting impractical.' The U.S. Army Field Manual describes the correct procedure for rendering a salute. It instructs that when 'uncovered' – that is, not wearing a cap – one should 'touch the tip of the right forefinger to the forehead near and slightly to the right of the right eyebrow.' During Tuesday's salute, Obama's cup was the only thing that made contact with his head. Obama made saluting news once before, in 2013, when he forgot to salute a Marine guarding his chopper before he bounded up the stairs to board it. Instead of sticking his head out the door and saluting, Obama returned all the way to ground level – and shook the young man's hand instead. No wire photographers captured pictures of the exact moment when the president executed his unconventional tea cup maneuver on Tuesday, but online fury built after the White House itself posted a short video clip of it on its Instagram page. 'What's worse?' one Twitter user asked: 'that Obama didn't put down his coffee cup before saluting, or that the WH thought it was smart to post it?'","President was exiting his Marine One helicopter after landing in New York City for speeches about global warming and fighting ISIS in Syria .

"Rapist: Footballer Ched Evans is due to be released within days. His victim has had to go into hiding due to online taunts . The woman who was raped by footballer Ched Evans is in hiding two years on – thanks to an internet campaign branding her a ‘money-grabbing’ liar. The victim was forced to adopt a new identity and leave her home town after Evans’ supporters broke the law by posting her name on Twitter in 2012. And now, just days before the Sheffield United striker is due to be released from jail, the woman has had to endure a further spate of online slurs. The campaign of abuse has been given fresh impetus by controversial comments from broadcaster Judy Finnigan, who claimed during ITV’s Loose Women show on Monday that the rape was ‘unpleasant’ but ‘not violent’ and the victim had ‘had far too much to drink’. She later apologised after a furious backlash. But yesterday Evans’ mother took to Twitter to praise Miss Finnigan’s intervention and highlight barbed comments still being posted by other users. Following the footballer’s rape conviction and five-year jail sentence in 2012, thousands of people – among them Evans’ friends and relatives – branded the victim a liar and named her on social media, despite her legal entitlement to lifelong anonymity as the victim of a sex attack. A web search today will still bring up sites claiming to name her and making vile comments about her part in the case. Police said that while some of the so-called ‘trolls’ were male football fans, the majority were women, many of whom made deeply personal attacks on the victim’s motivation in reporting the rape. Evans and his former Manchester City youth side team-mate Clayton McDonald had been out in his home town of Rhyl, Denbighshire in May 2011 and had booked a room at a nearby Premier Inn, their trial heard. He later told police they could have had ‘any girl we wanted’, saying: ‘We are footballers, that’s how it is. Footballers are rich, they have got money, that’s what the girls like.’ Scroll down for video . Video courtesy of ITV's This Morning . The victim – who they had earlier seen falling over in a kebab shop after drinking wine, double vodkas with lemonade and a sambuca shot – had approached McDonald, and the pair took a taxi to his hotel. When Evans entered the room, he found the pair having sex, and claimed McDonald asked if he wanted to have sex with the girl too, saying she had been ‘in control’ of herself. Evans left the hotel via a fire escape shortly after having sex with her, later telling police he had been worried his girlfriend Natasha Massey would phone him and become suspicious. Following the footballer’s rape conviction and five-year jail sentence in 2012, thousands of people – among them Evans’ friends and relatives – branded the victim a liar and named her on social media . The girl awoke the next morning, naked and alone, and told police the last thing she could remember was being in a takeaway. McDonald was acquitted of rape by the jury at Caernarfon Crown Court, but Evans looked shocked as he was found guilty. He was told by the judge he ‘must have realised’ that she had been ‘in no condition to have sexual intercourse’. Appeal court judges refused a bid to overturn the conviction, saying there was ‘no possible basis which would justify us interfering with the verdict of the jury’, also throwing out an attempt to cut his sentence. Evans, 25, is desperate to resume his football career when he is released on Friday from Wymott prison in Lancashire, half way through his sentence. But a petition appealing to Sheffield United chairman Kevin McCabe not to reinstate him had attracted almost 150,000 signatures after Miss Finnigan’s comments. Making her debut on Monday’s Loose Women, Miss Finnigan argued Evans should be allowed to play football again, saying: ‘I am not by any means minimising any kind of rape, but the rape was not violent. ‘He didn’t cause any bodily harm to the person. It was unpleasant. In a hotel room I believe. And she had had far too much to drink. It was reprehensible. But he has served his time.’ She later apologised ‘unreservedly’. Yesterday Northumbria police and crime commissioner Vera Baird, who campaigns over violence against women, said: ‘He raped her – that is a serious injury. If you get drunk and someone steals your wallet, does this mean it’s any less of a theft than if you were sober?’ In 2012, around 6,000 people mentioned the victim on Twitter alone. But just 21 were arrested, and after ten pleaded guilty to breaching the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act in 2012, they were ordered to pay her compensation totalling just £6,000. The punishment was branded ‘an insult to rape victims’ at the time.","The woman was raped by Ched Evans in a hotel room in 2011 .

"Meet Andele Lara, the 22-year-old student who is the mirror-image of risque superstar Rihanna. Andele, from Boston, Massachusetts is such a dead-ringer for the Bajan beauty that she can't step out the house without being mobbed by screaming Rihanna fans. Strangers follow Andele on her way to work and send her fan mail whilst companies pay her thousands of pounds to endorse their products - making her life not too dissimilar to the Umbrella singer. Scroll down for video . Likeness changed her life: Andele (left) is confused for Rihanna (right) on a daily basis and often approached by screaming fans . Mirror image: Her similarity to the singer means that companies pay her thousands of pounds to endorse their products . Guess who? A selfie from Andele Lara's Instagram account where she has a huge following because of her resemblance to Rihanna . Her success has prompted Andele to become a full-time Rihanna lookalike. She explains: 'The moment I step out anywhere, everyone starts staring and whispering before I get bombarded by strangers asking to take their photo with me. 'This happens every day - It doesn't matter what I do. I can't go twenty-four hours without hearing Rihanna's name. 'I know I could happily give up my part-time job and studies to have a career as a Rihanna lookalike.' As a child, Andele always felt like the ugly ducking. However she became more confident in her looks during her teens. She says: 'Growing up, I was a very shy girl. I was known as the skinny girl with the big forehead. 'But as I got older, I went through many stages to find myself and experimented with different hairstyles and fashion trends.' Andele - who is single and dating - was fifteen years old when friends at school first noticed her remarkable likeness to the world-famous diva. She explains: 'The comments started in my sophomore year. My friend had a magazine with Rihanna on the cover. He held it up to my face and was like ""You look like her!"" 'I wasn't really sure. She was glammed up in a magazine and here I was in my school uniform. 'Personally, I never realized I looked like Rihanna. I do see some resemblance but not as much as everyone else I think.' But as Rihanna's fame increased, Andele could not escape the comparisons to the star and her day-to-day life changed forever. Blossomed: Andele, pictured right, out clubbing with friend, says she felt like an ugly duckling as a child . Could be twins: Andele was 15 when friends at school first noticed her remarkable likeness to the singer . She explains: 'When 'Umbrella' came out, a lot more people began commenting that I looked like Rihanna. 'But after Ri-Ri released her album 'Loud' in 2010, the attention I started to receive for looking like her was undeniable. 'People began approaching me in the street asking if I was her and I would see photos of myself going viral on social media.' Now, Andele's incredible likeness to the singer means she is regularly swarmed by strangers believing her to be Rihanna. Resemblance pays off: Andele has landed over £13,000 worth of clothing contracts in the last year due to her uncanny resemblance . 'Literally, people mistake me for her all the time! I only have to step out of the house for an hour before I hear someone say, ""Oh my god, is that Rihanna?"" 'At first, I thought it was funny to take a picture with someone who believed I was her and then make their day. But as Rihanna gets even more famous, the attention just intensifies. 'Some people follow me into stores or as I'm driving. Other times fifteen people will swarm at me all at once to take a picture with me. 'I do think the attention I get is cool but there have been some scary occasions when some super-fans have followed me on my way to work everyday. 'And I must admit there have also been moments when I couldn't face taking a photo with yet another Rihanna fan. But it really makes their day to think they met Ri-Ri. I've never denied anyone a picture.' Andele says the attention is most extreme when she goes out clubbing. 'When I go on a night out, that's when the attention is at its highest. Even my friends get annoyed by the number of people that come up to me. 'Men come up to me all the time, thinking I'm Rihanna and buying me drinks! They chat me up and try to get my number.' Last year, Andele was even mistaken for Rihanna when she happened to be partying at the same nightclub as the star's bad boy ex Chris Brown. She says: 'I was at a club in Boston and Chris Brown was there. Because he was there, I guess everyone assumed I was Rihanna! 'I was casually walking around and all these star-struck people were holding their hand to their hearts backing away from me and staring. Rihanna mania: People regularly follow the 22-year-old as she goes about her life believing her to be the star . Andele now plans on becoming a professional Rihanna lookalike, but says unfortunately she can't sing . 'At first, I was confused but then I realised what was going on. In the end, I spent the whole night taking fun pictures with groups of people who had mistaken me for Rihanna.' Andele's resemblance to the singer has thrust her into the limelight and made her well-known on social media. As a result of the similarities, Andele has landed over £13,000 worth of clothing contracts in the last year and over 18,000 followers on Instagram. She says: 'I wouldn't really say I've gone out looking for opportunities, they've just come along naturally. I reckon if I put more effort, I would get even more! 'I've scored hair contracts as well as sneaker, mascara, hair accessories and apparel deals. I also get into clubs for free and I get a lot of free drinks too! 'I am grateful for my followers and I love the chance to give them advice. I get tons of fan-mail and messages from people. 'After Rihanna was banned from Instagram in April, some of her fans have written to me saying that my profile had replaced hers in their lives.' Even Rihanna herself has inadvertently come across Andele on social media. 'One Rihanna fan page on Instagram mistakenly posted my picture with the caption, 'Rare pic of Rihanna' and Rihanna actually commented on it with 'OH?!' 'But that was the closest I'd say to her knowing me. It was a brief moment but the comments and followers on my Instagram that came after that was unbelievable. 'Every time I refreshed my page, I had at least thirty new followers and some really hateful comments too. 'In the end, the attention and mean comments from some users was a bit too much. I had to turn my notifications off on Instagram and make my account private.' She added: 'I'm a big fan of Rihanna though. A lot of celebrities become someone they aren't but she seems to have stayed true to herself. 'I would love to meet Ri-Ri and take a selfie with her!' Andele plans on becoming a professional Rihanna lookalike but says she'll have to draw the line at performing like the popstar. She said: 'I know I could make a career of it. I'm pretty much a lookalike in my daily life now! But unfortunately I can't sing though so I might have to take singing lessons!'","Andele Lara, 22, is the mirror-image of risque superstar Rihanna .

"Plumes of water vapour 100 miles high may have been spotted bursting out of the icy surface of Jupiter's moon Europa. Scientists believe they detected two vapour jets shooting into space for seven hours at a time. Like 'Old Faithful', the famous volcanic geyser in Yellowstone National Park, U.S., the plumes appear to erupt at regular intervals. This is an artist's concept of a plume of water vapour thought to be ejected off the frigid, icy surface of the Jovian moon Europa, located about 500 million miles (800 million kM0 from the sun . But while Old Faithful manages around 100 feet, Europa's vapour fountains are thought to reach heights of 124 miles - around 20 times higher than the peak of Mount Everest. If confirmed, the observations prove that water from the moon's ice-covered ocean can easily reach the surface, which has important implications for future space missions. Many experts believe the hidden ocean surrounding Europa, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable to life. This graphic shows the location of water vapour detected over Europa's south pole in observations taken by Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope in December 2012 . Jupiter's icy moon Europa is slightly smaller than the Earth's Moon. Europa orbits Jupiter every 3.5 days and is phase locked -- just like . Earth's Moon -- so that the same side of Europa faces Jupiter at all . times. However, because Europa orbits in an oval, when it is close to Jupiter the tide is much higher. It is thought to have an iron core, a rocky mantle and a surface ocean of salty water, like Earth. Unlike on Earth, however, this ocean is deep enough to cover the whole surface of Europa, and being far from the sun, the ocean surface is globally frozen over. Many experts believe the hidden ocean . surrounding Europa, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's . gravity, may have conditions favourable to life. Scientists used images from the Hubble Space Telescope to identify unusual 'spikes' of hydrogen and oxygen in two distinct regions of the moon's southern hemisphere. They were observed for just seven hours at a time when Europa was at the furthest point of its orbit away from Jupiter, vanishing as the moon got closer. The discovery suggests the presence of high jets of water vapour - water is made from hydrogen and oxygen - that may be triggered by tidal forces opening cracks in Europa's surface. The team led by Dr Lorenz Roth, from Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, wrote in the journal Science: 'These emissions are persistently found in the same area over around seven hours.. They are consistent with two 200 kilometre-high plumes of water vapour.' Similar plumes have previously been seen on one of Saturn's moons, Enceladus. Details of the discovery were also presented at the American Geophysical Union's autumn meeting in San Francisco. Scientists used images from the Hubble Space Telescope to identify unusual 'spikes' of hydrogen and oxygen in two distinct regions of the moon's southern hemisphere . As well as Hubble, Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft is also currently providing scientists with key clues about Saturn's moons. In particular it is looking at the moon Titan and its hydrocarbon seas. Titan is one of the most Earth-like places in the solar system, and the only place other than our planet that has stable liquid on its surface. Cassini's recent close flybys are bringing into sharper focus a region in Titan's northern hemisphere that sparkles with almost all of the moon's seas and lakes. Scientists working with the spacecraft's radar instrument have put together the most detailed multi-image mosaic of that region to date. The image includes all the seas and most of the major lakes. The images show that the seasare more extensive and complex than previously thought. They also show nearly all of the lakes on Titan fall into an area covering about 600 miles by 1,100 miles (900 km by 1,800 km). Only 3 per cent of the liquid at Titan falls outside of this area. 'Scientists have been wondering why Titan's lakes are where they are. These images show us that the bedrock and geology must be creating a particularly inviting environment for lakes in this box,' said Randolph Kirk, a Cassini radar team member at the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Ariz. 'We think it may be something like the formation of the prehistoric lake called Lake Lahontan near Lake Tahoe in Nevada and California, where deformation of the crust created fissures that could be filled up with liquid.'","Scientists have detected two vapour jets appearing for up to seven hours .

"A son has won compensation from TV Licensing after he was wrongly threatened with a fine of £1,000. Peter Troy was repeatedly told to buy a licence for an empty property where his mother, retired nurse Marjorie, passed away. He received several demands for the money even after telling the firm of his loss. Finally, fed up with the constant demand for money and an inability to listen to him, he threatened to sue them. Now he has received compensation of £250 for the stress and inconvenience. Hassled: Mr Troy (pictured left with his demand letters) was hassled over buying a licence fee for his deceased mother, Marjorie (right) Complaint: Mr Troy said Capita, which collects licence fees on behalf on the BBC, was unnecessarily aggressive (stock image) TV Licensing admitted they got it wrong - and have promised to pull their socks up. But Mr Troy, of Rushyford, County Durham, said Capita, which collects licence fees on behalf on the BBC, was unnecessarily aggressive. He said the problems began when he received the first of several demands to pay for a new licence five months after his mother died. He said: 'My mother died in June last year and her house has been empty since. In November I received a letter, addressed to the occupier of my mother’s house in Devon, asking me to pay. 'I told them she had died but they kept sending more letters threatening to take me to court. I decided to sue them for £1,000, the same amount they were going to fine me, because they were not listening. It was only then they apologised and offered £250, which I have accepted. 'I am articulate and know how to complain but not everyone knows what to do. I found TV Licensing to be very hard-edged and a cold organisation who did not listen to common sense.' Mr Troy was offered the refund in a letter of apology from operations director Alison Roberts. The BBC used its income from the licence fee to pay for its TV, radio and online services . In a letter of apology she admitted something had gone wrong from their first contact with Mr Troy. She said: 'If the process had been followed correctly the adviser and indeed the team leader should have taken the information you provided regarding the property being unoccupied and noted the systems accordingly. This one action would have prevented the follow-up letters sent to the property.' She said Mr Troy's complaint had led to new procedures being put in place to stop the same thing happening again but she admitted Peter felt harassed by the department’s actions. Cases linked to the Department of Work and Pensions will now be managed with more flexibility. Capita, an outsourcing company that runs various activities including the Criminal Records Bureau, has often been the subject of controversy. It was revealed in January that Capita had misinformed people that they had to leave the UK as they had no valid visa. And many schools once had to delay the school year because the CRB could not cope with the number of teachers who had to be cleared. A TV Licensing spokesperson said: 'We take any complaints very seriously and when mistakes happen we try to correct them as quickly as possible. We have written to Mr Troy to offer our apologies and to make a goodwill gesture. 'We have since provided extra training to a specialist team, taking into account there may be unusual and sometimes distressing circumstances.'","Mr Peter Troy, from County Durham, received a payout for stress .

"These extraordinary images by the world’s first rock-climbing photographers show the pioneers of the sport scaling some of Britain’s highest peaks - with their bare hands.

"Disgusted: Ari Teman says that he discovered that his Manhattan apartment had been used to host an orgy after he interrupted the man who was organizing it . A New York comedian got an unwelcome shock on Friday when he discovered he had unwittingly rented out his apartment for an orgy. Ari Teman advertized his Manhattan apartment on Airbnb and was contacted by a man named David who said he wanted a place for his family to stay while he attended a wedding in the city. However, after handing over the keys to David during the afternoon, Teman realized he had forgotten a bag and went back to his apartment at 11.30 pm where he found the aftermath of an 'XXX Freak Fest' orgy that had taken place all over his home. According to Teman, when he returned to his apartment building he saw David in the lobby and heard him saying, 'they're shutting us down.' Asking David what that meant, Teman claims that that he look on in horror as the saw David total panic about his return. Rushing to his apartment to see it in a state of disarray, he googled David's telephone number to see what came up. The orgy, which was billed online as a 'BBW Panty Raid Party' advertized a cellphone number which matched the one provided by David in his AirBNB profile. Investigating further, Teman discovered the Twitter feed of @TWINN_GREEN, who was advertising a 'XXX Freak Fest' on Friday night at the location of Teman's building. Scroll down for video . Apartment on Airbnb: This is the frontage of Ari Teman's Manhattan apartment that was used to host a sex orgy on Friday night . Teman furiously ejected David from his home and is now claiming damages from Airbnb of $67,076 from the party and is fearful that his landlord will evict him. Indeed, David was listed as a verified member of the popular renting website and his profile contained multiple reviews - all positive. However, Teman says that among the damaged items were a broken sofa, bed, torn lamp, coffee table, drum set and his Fender guitar. Also, all of Teman's clothes were mysteriously damp, which caused an outraged Teman to write a Tumblr post about his woes, saying, 'I don't even want to know how it's wet.' Explicit: This is one of the promotional posters for the sex party that took place inside Ari Teman's apartment on Friday . Investigation: When Teman realized what had happened in his apartment he Googled David's telephone number and discovered this tweet . There were also condoms and liquor left lying around and Teman is claiming he is so embarrassed he can't look other tenants in the eye. 'I enjoy a 'Festival' as much as the next fellow, but this is a family building and some people don’t enjoy having their neighbor’s worldly possessions tossed in a pile into the common area, while a group of strangers form a pile to have their private areas tossed. As such, I’m going to be evicted.' Police from the NYPD's 10th precinct were eventually called to clear the apartment. Phoning the telephone number listed online, Gawker said they spoke to David who insisted he did nothing wrong, that there was no party and that Teman has said that he could have up to 50 guests to the apartment. Anger: When Ari realized what had occurred he instantly demanded an explanation from Airbnb . Prompt response: Airbnb have moved quickly to address Teman's issues with his apartment and their verification process . Teman disputes all of this and sent Airbnb a furious tweet - to which they responded very quickly. He was sent $23,817 and the company paid for someone to come over and change his locks. 'AirBNB has been in contact every day. Their staff has been helpful,' Teman told Gothamist. 'AirBNB is putting me in a hotel for a week.' The dispute between David and Teman is currently in the hands of their lawyers and AirBnB made this statement: . 'Over 11 million guests have had a safe and positive experience on Airbnb and problems for hosts and guests are incredibly rare, but when they happen, we try to help make things right. 'We were appalled when we learned about this incident and we took immediate action to help this host. 'The individual who rented this space has been permanently removed from our site. We've reimbursed the host for damages to his apartment and ensured he has a new place to stay. 'In the days ahead, we'll continue to work with the host to assist him with his additional needs and we will work cooperatively with any law enforcement agencies that investigate this matter.'","Manhattan comedian Ari Teman discovered to his horror that he had rented his apartment out to sex orgy organizers .

"Authorities in China have scooped up around 220,000 pounds of dead fish today that they say were poisoned by ammonia from a chemical plant. Locals said dead fish covered the surface of the Fuhe River in central China and stretched for about 25 miles. The Hubei province environmental protection blamed local company Hubei Shuanghuan Science and Technology Stock Co for the disaster. Pollution: 220,000 pounds of poisoned fish have been collected from the Fuhe river in central China . Local officials said the thousands of fish were poisoned by ammonia from a chemical plant . About 25 miles of the Fuhe River in Hubei Province was affected by the suspected ammonia leak . Officials said sampling of its drain . outlet showed that ammonia density far exceeded the national standard. The company said it was not going to immediately comment. About 1,600 residents in nearby Huanghualao make a living from fishing, Wang Sanqing, the village's Communist Party secretary said. He said the village has 150 fishing boats and fishermen could lose up to 70,000 yuan ($11,400) per day. 'The dead fish covered the entire river and looked like snowflakes', he said. Locals said the river was covered by the dead fish and that they 'looked like snowflakes' Local fisherman could lose up to 70,000 yuan a day after the poisoning . The local village has 150 fishing boats but they have been docked since the poisoning . The environmental department warned the . public not to eat the dead fish, but said drinking water was not . affected. It said it ordered the company to suspend operations and fix . the pollution problem. The official Xinhua News Agency said . about 220,000 pounds of dead fish had been cleared from 25 miles of the river, but did not cite a figure for the number of . fish. The environmental department said that 'a great number of . fish' had been recovered. Authorities have ordered Hubei Shuanghuan Science and Technology Stock Co to cease operations . It is the latest pollution scandal to hit China and residents are suspicious about the safety of drinking water . Inadequate controls on industry and lax enforcement of existing standards have worsened China's pollution problem, stemming from three decades of breakneck economic growth. High-profile incidents this year involving dead animals in rivers - not only deaths attributed to pollution but also carcasses dumped by farmers after die-offs at farms - have added to public disgust and suspicions about the safety of drinking water.","Thousands of fish killed in 25 mile stretch of Fuhe River in central China .

"The Ebola survivor whose dog was put down over fears it could have the killer disease has adopted a new puppy, it was revealed today. Nurse Teresa Romero’s beloved pet Excalibur was sacrificed in October despite a public outcry that saw protesters clash with riot police outside her home in Alcorcon, Spain, as it was taken away. The 44-year-old health worker described the dog as being like a child to her and announced she would fight for compensation through the courts after winning her battle for life. Scroll down for video . New arrival: Spanish nurse and Ebola survivor Teresa Romero (centre) and her husband Javier Limon (right) receive the dog Alma from Alcorcon's Mayor David Perez (left) in the city outside Madrid in Spain yesterday . Put down: Nurse Teresa Romero’s beloved pet dog Excalibur (pictured together) was sacrificed in October . But yesterday she took home an American Stafford puppy called Alma - Spanish for Soul. Mrs Romero and husband Javier Limon adopted the dog from an animal protection centre in Alcorcon. Mr Limon had attacked health chiefs for putting Excalibur down while he and his wife were in quarantine in a Madrid hospital. But he said as they picked up their new pet: ‘We’ve come here to adopt Alma and we want society to realise there are many abandoned animals that need a new home.’ Mrs Romero added: ‘I’d like it if our idea of adopting a dog could serve as an example so these animals can have a family like Alma and be happy.’ Authorities obtained a court order to enter the couple’s home and take Excalibur away while Mrs Romero, the first person to contract Ebola outside of West Africa, was battling the disease and her husband was being kept in isolation as a precaution. Freed from hospital: Mrs Romero (centre) at Carlos III Hospital in Madrid after being discharged in November . Couple: Mrs Romero (left) is kissed by her husband Javier Limon (right)  following her recovery from Ebola . The nurse fell ill days after cleaning the room of Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo who died from Ebola in September after being flown back from West Africa for treatment. She was released from hospital at the start of November after being treated with blood plasma from an Ebola survivor. Around 400,000 people signed a petition calling for Excalibur to be saved. Mr Limon wrote a letter to Excalibur a week after he was put to sleep, telling his pet: ‘Bad people without feelings took you away’ and promising to ‘seek justice’. Teresa later announced she was demanding €150,000 euros (£112,000) compensation for the sacrifice of her dog. Lawyers for the Spanish nurse claimed the decision to put the animal down was ‘improvised and taken against medical advice’. Fury: A demonstrator blocking the road to stop the van transporting Excalibur, who was to be put down, is removed by a policeman - outside the home in which Mrs Romero lives in Alcorcon, Spain, in October . Protest: Health workers  jeered the Spanish prime minister and threw gloves at him in October as he visited the hospital in Madrid where the nurse was being treated amid claims staff were stressed out . Yesterday it emerged British nurse Pauline Cafferkey, 39, had left hospital in London after making a complete recovery from Ebola. She caught the disease while volunteering in Sierra Leone. The current Ebola epidemic is believed to have started in December 2013 with an infected fruit bat in a forested area of Guinea. The World Health Organisation said in its latest update on the epidemic - the worst the world has ever seen - that 8,688 people had died. It said the crisis was still ‘extremely alarming’ although the UN said yesterday that Liberia, one of the worst-affected countries, was dealing with just five remaining cases of the disease.","Nurse Teresa Romero's beloved pet Excalibur was sacrificed in October .

"Vigilante justice is rising in one of America’s most violent cities as residents in crime-ridden neighbourhoods take matters into their own hands. Detroit, Michigan, saw 34 self-defence killings in 2011 - a 79 per cent increase from the previous year, according to statistics in The Daily. The 'justifiable homicides' rate is 2,200 per cent above the U.S. average, as citizens cope with alarmingly high response times and police cuts. Scroll down for video .

That compares to an average of ten minutes in comparable cities across the rest of the country. An FBI report shows Detroit homicides . ranked second in the nation per capita last year, rising ten per cent in . 2011 to 344 people. The Detroit police department rolled out a plan in January to close precincts and district headquarters to the public after 4pm. This was an effort to put more . officers on patrol, especially in the most besieged neighbourhoods, . without adding to the city's $200million deficit.

"French women are covering up in unprecedented numbers, with just one in fifty now willing to go topless on the beach - and France's free-falling economy could be to blame. According to a poll by the French edition of Elle magazine this summer, just two per cent of women surveyed are now happy to shed their bikini tops when sunbathing. And according to one sociologist, a general air of low confidence in the country thanks to its consistently poor economic performance could be behind the cultural shift. Scroll down for video . Fading fast: Just two per cent of French women are willing to join this subather bathing topless in St Tropez . Jean-Clade Kauffman, the author of a book on female nudity, said the French are newly averse to 'risk and revolution' thanks to austerity measures causing unrest in the country. She said: 'France has also been hard hit by austerity since the start of the financial crisis. 'If breast-baring is a sign of risk and revolution, covering up is a sign of safety. In uncertain times, you always dress more conservatively.' The survey shows a dramatic change of attitude in France, which used to be a haven of toplessness, even when it was taboo across most of the world in the 1960s. Reluctant: An air of depression thanks to the poor French economy has been suggested as a possible cause . Actress Brigette Bardot, who appeared in sexually-charged films of the era and was photographed holidaying topless in the Riviera. But now women are far more hesitant, from Brest to Bordeaux, according to the magazine survey. Muriel Trazie, 60, sunbathes in Paris often, and said: 'It's seen as vulgar. People are more prudish these days.' Meanwhile Sandra Riahi, 22, in a bikini, chimed in: 'I've never done it. I'd be too embarrassed.' Kaufmann also suggested the decline was because today's women have forgotten the freedoms won by feminists in decades past. Quelle difference: In the 1960s French stars like Brigitte Bardot, pictured above in a 1963 film, led the way by regularly going topless . She said: 'French young women today are more conformist. They've already attained freedom ... So they've gotten lazy and taken it for granted.' In one Parisian park, local authorities have gone so far to erect signs reminding women in the area to remember their bikini tops. Social media has also been mooted as a culprit. Nathan Assouline, a 22-year-old beach monitor at Paris Plages, an artificial beach in the capital, said some sunbathers could be discouraged by the rise of phone cameras. He said: 'I see lots of old men loitering around here,' he said. 'I have to stop them from taking photos on their phones. It happens all the time.'","Poll this summer showed that hardly any French women prepared to strip off .

"A 3-year-old Florida boy is dead after enduring horrific torture including having been burned, beaten and thrown across a room - and, according to authorities, the boy's 21-year-old mother is to blame. Ghanson Debrosse was rushed to the Jackson North Medical Center about 3:30 am on Tuesday after his mother, Fafane Caze, called 9-1-1 to report that he wasn't breathing. At the hospital, doctors determined that the 3-year-old boy had been dead for several hours. Tragedy: Authorities say 3-year-old Ghanson Debrosse was tortured to death by his own mother . Fafane Caze is accused of torturing her 3-year-old son to death by beating, throwing and burning him with a cigarette lighter . Caze told investigators that the boy recently had been in Haiti visiting relatives. When she picked him up from the airport, she initially claimed, he showed signs of abuse. After 12 hours of questioning, Caze admitted to beating and torturing the boy. 'She didn’t shed a tear,' Neal Cuevas, a major with the Miami Police Department, told the Miami Herald. 'She cared more about getting arrested than she did about her son.' According to her arrest report, Caze 'used a lighter to burn the victim's genital area, in an attempt to stop the victim from urinating on the floor.' On Wednesday, Detective Alonzo Rhymer testified that the boy also had burns on his face and fingers, as well as buckle-shaped scars all over his body. The imprint left by the buckle, he said, was a match for the buckle Caze wore as part of her uniform for her job as a security guard, which left multiple scars and open wounds. 'Some were fresh, some were old,' Rhymer testified. History: The Department of Children and Families had been called to Caze's house three times before her son's lifeless body was brought to a hospital . Detectives also say that Caze beat the boy with a broom handle when he defecated on himself. The broom handle was found broken in Caze's home. Caze admitted to authorities that she threw the boy across a room and into a table. Afterwards, the toddler gasped for air and asked for water as he struggled to breathe. It was only after the boy had stopped breathing completely that Caze called 9-1-1. In his report, a North Miami detective wrote that in the past Caze had 'refused to seek medical attention to treat the victim's injuries, . instead concocting a remedy of vegetable oil and laundry blue to treat . the victim's wounds.' On Tuesday, Florida Department of Children and Families Secretary Esther Jacobo told reporters about three prior reports made to the agency about Caze's family, each of which was in 2010. In one case, Caze was holding baby Ghanson as she had a physical altercation with his father, Donald Debrosse. According to the DCF report, Caze attempted to throw the then-infant at Debrosse. Tortured: 3-year-old Ghanson would be burned and beaten as punishment for wetting himself . For now, Fafane has been charged with aggravated child abuse and . torture. The judge in the case added the charge of attempted felony murder to the list, which kept her remanded without bail as a murder charge is pending depending on the results of a report from the medical examiner. 'If anybody deserves the additional charge she deserves . it,' Cuevas said. 'She doesn’t deserve her . freedom. She doesn’t deserve being around her children and she . definitely doesn’t deserve to be around anyone else’s children.' Caze has two other children - ages 1 and 4 - who were placed in foster care following their mother's arrest after no friends or members of Caze's family stepped forward to take them in.","Authorities say Fafane Caze would burn her 3-year-old son's genitals as punishment for wetting himself .

"A deaf man killed an actor with one punch after signing ‘watch me’ to a friend, a court has heard. Matthew Powe, 30, attacked 34-year-old Vitalis Katakinas, who was also deaf, at a pub in Highbury, north London after a British Sign Language event, last June, a jury heard. It came after the thespian, who was also deaf, knocked his glasses off, the Old Bailey was told. Matthew Powe, 30, attacked 34-year-old Vitalis Katakinas, who was also deaf, at a pub in Highbury, north London after a British Sign Language event, last June, a jury has heard . Both men had been to the event before making their way to the White Swan pub in Highbury, north London, last June. Powe had quarrelled with Mr Katakinas and another man before he knocked the victim out with one punch, jurors heard. Father-of-one Mr Katakinas, from Lithuania, suffered a serious head injury and died in hospital one week later. Described . as an inspirational actor, the victim had won accolades for his . performance in Deafinitely Theatre’s hit production of Shakespeare’s . Love’s Labour’s Lost. Powe, of Haringey, north London, denies murder and an alternate charge of manslaughter. Prosecutor Alan Kent QC said: ‘On Saturday, 29 June 2013, the deceased Vitalis Katalinas travelled with his fiancee Lina Kankevicinti from their home in south east London to the British Sign Language Pride event in the park at Highbury Fields as did many, many other people. It came after thespian Mr Katakinas, who was also deaf, knocked his glasses off, the Old Bailey was told . ‘Once the event finished some of those who had attended went to the pub afterwards, a pub called the White Swan, which is a Wetherspoon Pub near Highbury and Islington Underground station. ‘It was there, sometime around 11.30pm on that Saturday that Vitalis Katalinas the man who died became involved in an argument with another man, not this defendant. ‘The defendant Matthew Powe intervened and unfortunately the argument descended into violence. ‘There is some evidence that Mr Katalinas struck the first blow, he punched the defendant in the face or pushed him, that caused the defendant’s glasses to fall off. ‘He bent down, picked them up and put them back on. ‘Having done so he signed to a friend ‘watch me’ and punched Vitalis Katalinas in the face. 'That punch knocked Mr Katalinas to the ground and indeed it seems that the defendant also ended up on the ground. ‘But Mr Katakinas was probably unconscious from that first punch and he in fact never regained consciousness. ‘He died in hospital seven days later on Saturday, 6 July.’ Powe claims he was acting in self defence but Mr Kent said he attacked his victim in retaliation. The court heard the fight started between Mr Katakinas and another man Thomas Giddens, a friend of his fiancée Lina, who he planned to marry this year. Powe had quarreled with Mr Katakinas and another man before he knocked the victim out with one punch, jurors heard . The court heard the fight started between Mr Katakinas (pictured) and another man Thomas Giddens, a friend of his fiancee Lina, who he planned to marry this year . Mr Katakinas was said to have been 'jealous' at how close they were and a few days before the deaf event Mr Giddens allegedly sent him a Facebook message saying: 'Go f*** yourself' Mr Katakinas was said to have been ‘jealous’ at how close they were and a few days before the deaf event Mr Giddens allegedly sent him a Facebook message saying: “Go f*** yourself.” When they came face to face on June 29, jurors heard Mr Katakinas beckoned Mr Giddens over and an argument broke out. Mr Kent said there was 'clearly an atmosphere'  and Mr Katakinas became very 'animated and direct' in his sign language. His fiancée tried to stop it but when Mr Katakinas told her not to interrupt she went off with a friend.'When she returned Vitalis was on the ground,' the prosecutor said. ‘In summary the defendant admits punching the deceased but says that he was acting in lawful self defence and says his actions weren’t unlawful,’ he said. ‘The prosecution case is that this defendant was acting out of retaliation of revenge and it wasn’t self defence and was therefore unlawful. ‘We say that in hitting the deceased as he did the defendant must have intended to cause him at least really serious bodily harm.’ A team of sign language interpreters are translating the trial to him. The attack was witnesses by a number of deaf people who had also attended the British Sign Language event, the court heard. ‘As this incident took place outside a busy pub in a London street there were many witnesses,’ Mr Kent said. The trial, which is expected to last four weeks, continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Matthew Powe, 30, attacked Vitalis Katakinas, 34, at a pub, court heard .

"An awful 146-word term paper littered with grammatical errors that is barely even readable has become a potent visual symbol of the University of North Carolina's fake classes scandal. The one-paragraph essay on civil rights icon Rosa Parks earned an A- and was exposed by former UNC professor Mary Willingham, who spent 10 years teaching UNC's athletes before she turned whistleblower on alleged classroom corruption. The shocking essay came to light during an ESPN documentary timed to coincide with the March Madness basketball competition. It contains allegations that UNC athletes in danger of failing were encouraged to sign up for fake tutor groups designed to let students pass. Scroll Down for a Video: . Allegations of academic fraud: This is Mary Willingham a former student adviser at UNC who has claimed that many athletic students at the college were unable to read or write and that fake classes were set up to enable them to play and to graduate . The so-called 'paper classes' were essentially no-show study groups that allowed semi-literate and in some cases, illiterate athletes to pass, thereby boosting their Grade Point Average to meet the NCAA's eligibility requirements. The anonymous essay, titled, 'Rosa Parks: My Story' attempts to recount the important moment on December 1, 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, when Parks refused to give her seat up for a white man. However, it fails to even place the event in the past or give any gravitas to the momentous moment in American history. 'Some of these college students could read at a second or third grade level,' Willingham, a UNC academic adviser since 2003 told ESPN. 'Students were taking classes that really didn't exist. They were called independent studies at that time and they just had to write a paper... There was no attendance.' During the course of her ESPN interview, Williams confirmed the existence of 'easy paper classes' and alleged that students were guided to these classes by their academic advisors. 'Their job isn't necessarily to make Deunta Williams a better person, a smarter person,' Williams told ESPN. 'Their job is to make sure I'm eligible to play.' Deunta Williams, played football at UNC from 2007 to 2010 and has admitted to the scam, now says he is ashamed to have been involved with it. Willingham's whistleblowing began in 2011 after she became appalled that UNC, rather than educating its athletes was keeping them from needing to study at all. The paper: This is the essay on Rosa Parks that received an A- that Mary Willingham produced as evidence of apparent academic fraud on an ESPN special timed to coincide with March Madness . She began to release information to journalists about  basketball and football stars who read at a grade school level. She confessed herself to steering many young men into lecture classes that simply did not exist. And most galling for her, given UNC's proud history pushing for desegregation, that the courses were in African-American history. Willingham began to feed information about alleged academic fraud to the News & Observer in Raleigh. UNC is heavily invested in the $16 billion business that is college sports but Willingham's revelations threaten that. 'I was part of something that I came to be ashamed of,' said Willingham to Bloomberg News in February. On the evening of December Rosa Parks decided that she was going to sit in the  white people section on the bus in Montgomery, Alabama. During this time blacks had to give up there seats to whites when more whites got on the bus. Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. Her and the bus driver began to talk and the conversation went like this. 'Let me have those front seats' said the driver. She didn’t get up and told the driver that she was tired of giving her seat to white people. 'I’m going to have you arrested,' said the driver. 'You may do that,' Rosa Parks responded. Two white policemen came in and Rosa Parks asked them 'why do you all push us around?' The police officer replied and said 'I don’t know, but the law is the law and you’re under arrest. 'We weren’t serving the kids. We weren’t educating them properly. We were pushing them toward graduation, and that’s not the same as giving them an education.' When she publicly came forward, UNC stripped of her supervisory title and denied the allegations of widespread academic fraud. UNC officials noted in a statement released after the ESPN report aired that little new information was revealed and noted that the university has used the episode as a chance to improve. 'We have instituted numerous reforms, including new governance and accountability standards in our Academic Support Program for Student-Athletes,' Vice Chancellor for Communications and Public Affairs Joel Curran said in the statement. In January senior UNC officials publicly condemned her for suggesting that football and basketball stars couldn’t read well enough to get through college classes honestly. The fake classes were investigated in 2012 and Department head Julius Nyang’oro was listed as the instructor for the classes, although he calender revealed him to be abroad during some of these. He has been charged with a felony for defrauding the university, and is currently fighting the charge in court. Indeed, North Carolina has been in an academic crisis mode for more than three years. Shocking: Mary Willingham said her research of 183 football or basketball players at UNC from 2004-12 found 60 percent reading at fourth- to eighth-grade levels and roughly 10 percent below a third-grade level. An NCAA investigation into the football program in 2010 expanded into a probe of how the nation's first public university provides academic help to athletes. It led to a discovery of fraud in a department with classes featuring significant athlete enrollments. Now, the debate of balancing academics and big-time sports at the university has been reignited by comments from a reading specialist about the reading levels of football and basketball players. 'It really has just been like we've been under siege for the past three years,' said Lissa Lamkin Broome, a banking law professor and UNC's faculty athletic representative in January. 'Now to the extent that we've uncovered problems during this siege, that's a good thing — to find those problems and weed them out and to try to put processes in place to hopefully ensure ... that some of this stuff doesn't happen again.' In a CNN story that aired in January, Willingham said her research of 183 football or basketball players at UNC from 2004-12 found 60 percent reading at fourth- to eighth-grade levels and roughly 10 percent below a third-grade level. She said she worked with one men's basketball player early in her 10-year tenure who couldn't read or write. 'I don't believe it's true,' UNC coach Roy Williams said in January. 'It's totally unfair. I'm really proud of the kids we've brought in here. ... We haven't brought anybody in like that. We've had one senior since I've been here that did not graduate. Allegations: Mary Willingham said she worked with one men's basketball player early in her 10-year tenure who couldn't read or write (Her allegations did not relate to Deunta Williams - who is pictured here in a game gainst the Duke Blue Devils in 2009) 'Anybody can make any statement they want to make but that is not fair. The University of North Carolina doesn't do that. The University of North Carolina doesn't stand for that.' Willingham has said in interviews that she has received death threats and hate mail. UNC police spokesman Randy Young said investigators have contacted her and 'are responding appropriately.' Broome said Willingham had shared her findings previously but hasn't provided data that led to her conclusions. 'If Mary's data uncovers issues that would be helpful to us in our admissions process or in our academic support process, then I want to know about those so we can benefit from whatever work she has done ... in moving forward and doing things better,' Broome said. Admissions director Stephen Farmer, a review group member, said his office won't hesitate to tell coaches no if a recruit can't handle coursework. 'We do not rubber-stamp anyone for admission,' Farmer said. 'We evaluate students for admission and we decide whether the students are capable of succeeding academically at UNC. That's about as plain as I can make it.' The topic of balancing academics and athletics isn't unique to UNC, such as the AP reporting in 2011 that 39 schools had at least 50 percent of football players clustering in one, two or three majors. But the scope of problems here has often left officials sifting through what happened as much as looking ahead. In December, a grand jury indicted Nyang'oro for receiving $12,000 to teach one of the no-show classes in summer 2011, a lecture course that was instead treated as an independent study requiring a paper. The enrollment was 18 football players and one ex-player.","A terrible 146-word term paper on Rosa Parks that received an A from University of North Carolina is released .

"Analysis of mobile phone data suggests Madeleine McCann could have been kidnapped by a gang of burglars who panicked when she woke up as they raided her holiday apartment . Three prime suspects for the abduction of Madeleine McCann have been identified by Scotland Yard officers. Analysis of mobile phone data suggests a burglary gang was operating very near to where she vanished in Portugal in May 2007. The three men made an unusually high number of calls to each other in the hours after Madeleine was reported missing from her holiday flat in the Algarve. Police believe the thieves, including at least one Portuguese man, had already carried out one raid in the resort of Praia da Luz, disturbing a child. That child’s parents, who had been drinking outside the property, rushed inside to find the intruders had fled. During their bungled investigation Portuguese police attached no significance to the break-in, which came a few days before Madeleine disappeared. British detectives said this oversight was a ‘disgrace’. Following the Yard phone breakthrough, informal discussions have taken place about arresting the three burglars and searching their homes and other sites. It is believed background checks have taken place into their criminal history, their circle of friends and relatives and the vehicles they have used. British detectives believe the burglars may have panicked after they woke Madeleine up by mistake and decided to take her away with them. Kate and Gerry McCann pose with an artist's impression of how their daughter might look at the age of nine last year . An informed source said: ‘After all the . far-fetched theories about what may have happened to Madeleine, there . may be a far more simple explanation: that a burglary went horribly . wrong. 'It is the main line of inquiry for British police.’ But Scotland Yard’s hopes of  early . arrests have been thwarted by the reluctance of the Portuguese . authorities to agree to a formal joint investigation. Because . none of the burglars is British, the Met cannot arrest them in Portugal . and will need the full cooperation of local police to pursue the . inquiry. Behind the scenes, highly sensitive diplomatic discussions are taking place to resolve the issue so that British detectives can be based in Portugal. Home Secretary Theresa May is being briefed regularly. 'After all the far-fetched theories about . what may have happened to Madeleine, there may be a far more simple . explanation: that a burglary went horribly wrong.' Yard detectives have dismissed the idea that a local man who died in a tractor accident four years ago was responsible for Madeleine’s disappearance. Portuguese police regard the 40-year-old, a former employee at the Ocean Club holiday complex the McCanns stayed at, as their prime suspect. Met officers disagree with their reasoning and are concentrating on the burglars. The compelling mobile phone ‘cell site analysis’ – which has helped solve a number of major crimes – has strengthened  suspicions about the gang. A major appeal based on ‘substantive’ new information – including descriptions of possible suspects – was broadcast on the BBC1’s Crimewatch in October. Days before the appeal, senior detectives revealed mobile phone records may hold the key to solving the case. Detective Chief Inspector Andy . Redwood, who is leading the inquiry, said officers were examining data . from thousands of mobiles thought to belong to people who were in Praia . da Luz around the time of Madeleine’s disappearance. The data suggests the men were involved in a burglary a few days before Madeleine's disappearance during which they woke a another child . Madeleine McCann went missing from her apartment in The Ocean Club in Praia Da Luz in 2007 . Police are trying to identify the owner of each phone to build up a picture of exactly who was in the area. More than 3,000 people live in Praia da Luz, while holidaymakers and seasonal workers visit from around the world. ‘This is not just a general trawl,’ said Mr Redwood. ‘It’s a targeted attack on that data to see if it assists us to find out what happened to Madeleine at that time.’ Mr Redwood said officers had been unable to identify, six years on, a large number of mobile phones, especially those bought on a pay-as-you-go basis. The records also contain information on which numbers were dialled and when. It is thought some numbers might appear on police intelligence systems, or be linked to criminals. According to Scotland Yard, the phone records were looked at by the Portuguese police investigation but in no detail. Scotland Yard announced it was launching an investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance in July – after spending two years reviewing the case under the codename Operation Grange. Madeleine, whose parents Gerry and Kate live in Rothley, Leicestershire, was days away from her fourth birthday when she was abducted. Earlier this week it emerged that the bill for the Yard’s probe has topped £6million. The total is now likely to exceed £10million, with £88,000 having gone on travel costs so far.","Data suggests a burglary gang was operating near time of disappearance .

"Ander Herrera has become Louis van Gaal’s first signing as Manchester United manager in a £28.7million deal. United moved to pay the buy-out clause fee for the 24-year-old Athletic Bilbao midfielder on Tuesday and he is travelling to London before signing a four-year contract. Herrera, an intelligent and stylish midfielder, was the subject of a £24m offer from David Moyes’s United last summer. VIDEO Ander Herrera set to sign for Manchester United .

Race against time: Herrera's buyout clause at Athletic Bilbao was set to increase on June 30 . At that time they did not believe it was worth paying the best part of £5m more to make the deal happen. United denied problems trying to sign Herrera last year — namely when three lawyers turned up at La Liga headquarters in an attempt to push through the transfer without knowledge of either club. They know the buy-out figure is due to rise to £32m from July 1 and Ed Woodward, the club’s executive vice-chairman, did not want another saga to drag on this summer. Herrera has been watched by United for more than three years, with Sir Alex Ferguson’s brother Martin among the first to bring him to the club’s attention. VIDEO Van Gaal set for German shopping spree . Forward planning: Incoming United boss Louis van Gaal is aiming to strengthen his squad this summer . Despite shelving the signing last August, Moyes had promised Herrera he would monitor his progress. A dip in form followed but he recovered to help propel Bilbao to fourth place in La Liga. Herrera, part of Spain’s Olympic squad at London 2012, was also a team-mate of United’s Juan Mata and David de Gea with Spain Under 21s. Van Gaal is already starting to put his mark on the squad, with Antonio Valencia and Patrice Evra both signing contract extensions.

"This is the explosive moment the Norwegian navy blew up one of its own ships to test out their latest long-range stealth missile. The KNM Trondheim, a 300ft long decommissioned frigate, was transported out into the sea off the coast of Andoy to be used as target practice. Dramatic footage released by military bosses captures the countdown before the new 'Naval Strike Missile' - a four-metre long, 880lb weapon - is fired in the direction of the vessel.

Practice makes perfect: The KNM Trodnheim, a decommissioned frigate, was selected for target practice by the Norwegian navy . Impact: Video footage shows the missile striking the ship with pinpoint accuracy sending debris flying into the air . Norway may have a reputation as a largely peaceful nation, but when it comes to arming its navy - no expense has been spared. The Naval Strike Missile is a sophisticated . anti-ship and land-attack weapon developed especially by Norwegian defence and aerospace firm Kongsberg. The 880lb missile is propelled towards its target at subsonic speed by a  Microturbo TRI-40 turbojet. It is almost four metres long and carries a 125kg warhead which is capable of destroying or severely damaging any naval vessel. Fitted with a GPS system, it can travel stealthily over coastline, oceans and land. This agility means it can also pull off last-minute G-force maneuvers to prevent getting shot down. The combination of an imaging infrared (IIR) seeker and an onboard target database ensures that the missile can seek out and detect targets up to 100 nautical miles away with pinpoint precision. The subsonic missile, which has a range of up to 150km, smashed straight into the frigate with pinpoint accuracy. Video . from onboard the KNM Trondheim, shows the frightening moment of impact . as a huge fireball erupts and debris spews hundreds of feet into the . air. The vessel suffered major damage as a result of the 275lb warhead and was towed back into a harbour following the exercise. Stig Klynderud, who oversaw the . operation, said: 'The damage to the target ship was as expected and . cleanup went according to plan.' Naval . Strike Missiles are the latest generation surface warfare missile . system from Scandinavian defence firm Kongsberg and are currently being . used by the Norwegian navy. The Polish navy is also set to arm themselves with the weapon. Kongsberg is also developing a Joint Strike Missle (JSM) for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Fighter Jets used by the US and Britain's RAF. Such an overt display of military strength is unusual for Norway, a traditionally neutral country. It was forced to enter World War Two after being invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940, but the resistance lasted only two months. Today, the Royal Norwegian Navy consists of around 3,700 personnel and 70 vessels including frigates, patrol boats and submarines.

"Manchester United are prepared to commit as much as £100million to their pursuit of Angel Di Maria as the ailing Barclays Premier League club try to beef up Louis van Gaal’s squad before the end of the summer transfer window. United manager Van Gaal is desperate for world-class additions and has told executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward to do all he can to bring winger Di Maria to the club from Real Madrid. It is understood United have told the Argentine that, with performance-based incentives, they will pay him around £200,000 a week.

United are also interested in Ajax’s Daley Blind, and were getting close to signing defender Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon on Sunday night. The Portuguese club want to take Nani on loan in return, although he is reluctant to agree.

"The amount of space junk orbiting Earth has reached a tipping point. According to Nasa, this junk – which can include anything from old rockets, abandoned satellites to missile shrapnel - will soon make it difficult for spacecraft to leave the planet. A German photographer, Michael Najjar, has created the below image to show just how serious a problem space debris has become.

One major source of debris in the past was the testing of anti-satellite weapons carried out by both the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s. Accidental events have also contributed to the problem. In February 2007 for instance, a Russian Briz-M booster stage exploded in orbit over South Australia. The booster had been carrying an Arabsat-4A communication satellite but malfunctioned before it could use all of its propellant creating a cloud of space debris. More recently, the GOCE satellite, also known as the ‘Ferrari of space’, made a fiery fall to Earth sometime between the end of this month and the start of November. Its debris fell along a path through East Asia and the Western Pacific to Antarctica but no one was hurt. Several solutions to retrieving or moving the space junk have been put forward including giant cosmic versions of harpoons, nets, tethers, magnets and even a giant dish or umbrella-shaped device. Mr Najjar created the image of space junk in collaboration with the Institute of Aerospace Systems at the Braunschweig University of Technology, which helps track space debris . The photographer describes himself as a ‘certified civilian astronaut’ and plans to be the ‘first artist in space’. He has already secured a ticket to go to space on board Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo in 2014. Starting prices for one flight cost $200,000 (£122,900) Mr Najjar said that by flying high above the Earth, he hopes the questions ‘who are we, and where do we come from?’ His work is an attempt to highlight the technology and culture of space flight by changing the context in which it is presented.","Each sphere in the image represents an existing object orbiting in space .

"The magnetic field emitted by our Galaxy has been revealed for the first time in a stunning new image. Taken by  ESA’s Planck satellite, it compiled from the first all-sky observations of ‘polarised’ light emitted by interstellar dust in the Milky Way. The astronomical equivalent of looking through polarised sunglasses, it shows swirls, loops and arches that trace the structure of the magnetic field in our home galaxy, the Milky Way. The Galaxy's magnetic field is revealed in a new image from ESA;s Planck satellite. This image was compiled from the first all-sky observations of polarised light emitted by interstellar dust in the Milky Way, and was obtained using detectors on Planck that act like polarised sunglasses. Planck is ESA’s time machine, looking back to the dawn of time close to the Big Bang, about 13.7 billion years ago. Planck will analyse, with the highest accuracy ever achieved, the remnants of the radiation that filled the Universe immediately after the Big Bang – observed today as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The results will help astronomers in deciding which theories on the birth and evolution of the Universe are correct, for example, did the Universe start its life with a rapid period of expansion? Light is a very familiar form of energy and yet some of its properties are all but hidden to everyday human experience. One of these – polarisation – carries a wealth of information about what happened along a light ray’s path, and can be exploited by astronomers. Light can be described as a series of waves of electric and magnetic fields that vibrate in directions that are at right angles to each other and to their direction of travel, according to ESA. This can happen, for example, when light bounces off a reflective surface like a mirror or the sea. Special filters can be used to absorb this polarised light, which is how polarised sunglasses eliminate glare. In space, the light emitted by stars, gas and dust can also be polarised in various ways. 'By measuring the amount of polarisation in this light, astronomers can study the physical processes that caused the polarisation,' the European Space Agency says. 'In particular, polarisation may reveal the existence and properties of magnetic fields in the medium light has travelled through.' The new map was obtained using detectors on Planck that acted as the astronomical equivalent of polarised sunglasses. In addition to its hundreds of billions of stars, our Galaxy is filled with a mixture of gas and dust, the raw material from which stars are born. the European Space Agency's Planck satellite previously captured this microwave radiation image from the whole sky. In this image, the dust of the Milky Way is shown in blue, with a red band across the centre showing hot regions, while the mottled yellow area above and below represents relic radiation, otherwise known as the Cosmic Microwave Background, created in the fireball of the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago, which is the oldest light in the Universe. Even though the tiny dust grains are very cold, they do emit light but at very long wavelengths – from the infrared to the microwave domain. If the grains are not symmetrical, more of that light comes out vibrating parallel to the longest axis of the grain, making the light polarised. If the orientations of a whole cloud of dust grains were random, no net polarisation would be seen. However, cosmic dust grains are almost always spinning rapidly, tens of millions of times per second, due to collisions with photons and rapidly moving atoms. Then, because interstellar clouds in the Milky Way are threaded by magnetic fields, the spinning dust grains become aligned preferentially with their long axis perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. As a result, there is a net polarisation in the emitted light, which can then be measured.","Compiled from the first all-sky observations of ‘polarised’ light emitted by interstellar dust in the Milky Way .

"Last night skywatchers were treated to the annual Eta Aquarid meteor shower. But later this month we might be in store for a meteor storm that has never been seen before as Earth passes through the tail of a comet. As our planet passes through debris from Comet 209P/LINEAR, astronomers say we could see as many as 1,000 shooting stars per hour. On the nights of 23 and 24 May sky watchers could be in for a treat as Earth passes through the debris left by Comet 209P/LINEAR. This could provide observers in the US and Canada with up to 1,000 meteors an hour in what has been described as a 'meteor storm' The event will occur on the nights of 23 and 24 May, when Earth’s path crosses that of the comet, and will first be most visible from the northern US and southern Canada as well as parts of Europe. From the UK the event is not expected to be visible, although on before dawn on 24 May some meteors may still be visible. As our planet moves into the 'blizzard' of of ice and rock chunks, they will burn up in the atmosphere, providing observers below with slow moving but bright meteors. The reason we could see so many meteors is because all of the debris it has ejected between 1803 and 1924 will be in Earth’s path. ‘This potential new shower is so new that astronomers aren’t sure what to expect,’ said Jane Houston of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ‘Predictions run from less than 100 meteors per hour up to an unlikely but possible meteor storm as high as 1,000 per hour.’ The comet was first spotted back in February 2004, but this is the first chance encounter between it and Earth. The discovery was made by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) project. It . completes an orbit of the Sun every 5.09 years, with its orbit ranging . from just inside that of Earth to almost as far as Jupiter. Following . our encounter with its tail, the comet will be as close as 5 million . miles (8.3 million kilometres) to Earth on 29 May before it makes its . way out towards Jupiter again on its orbit. The meteor storm will be visible in the night sky from the northern US and southern Canada, as well as other swathes of the Northern Hemisphere (see next picture). The best views will be towards the North Star (Polaris) above Camelopardalis, with this meteor storm being dubbed Camelopardid . However, there is still a chance the event will not be as impressive as predicted. ‘The idea of a brand new meteor shower is indeed very exciting,’ astronomer Gemma Lavender from All About Space magazine tells MailOnline. ‘The shower has been referred to as a ""meteor storm"", however, judging by recent calculations, the idea of a phenomena that will see 1,000 meteors per hour is in fact dwindling. ‘We’re more likely to see a strong shower rather than a storm of meteors. ‘However, of course, we won’t know it’s true strength until we head outside and observe the meteor shower for ourselves when 209P/LINEAR arrives.’ Amateur astronomers are advised to keep their eyes on the sky as Earth makes its way through the comet's tail later this month. On its first night the meteor storm will be visible in the US and Canada. As Earth rotates and moves, however, parts of Europe should also be treated to a view. As the extent of the meteor storm is unknown, your best bet is to keep an eye on reports as the event draws near . This 30 April 2014 image was taken using the Nasa Marshal Space Flight Center 20"" telescope located in New Mexico. Comet 209P/LINEAR (pictured in circle) was first spotted in February 2004, but this will be its first encounter with Earth. The comet completes an orbit of the sun roughly every five years .","A remarkable new meteor shower is set to take place later this month .

"Ryan Walker, 19, was jailed after stabbing a girl in the face and smashing another's head against a fence because they called him Harry Potter . A bullied teenager has been jailed after stabbing a girl in the face and smashing another’s head against a fence - because they called him Harry Potter. Ryan Walker, 19, wears glasses and has short dark hair, just like actor Daniel Radcliffe who plays the young wizard in the hit film series. A court heard how after two girls called Walker Harry Potter, he snapped, stabbing one of them in the face so hard that the blade of his vegetable knife broke. Walker then pushed the other girl's head into a nearby fence and shouted: ‘Die, die’. He claimed he launched the ferocious attacks in Southampton, Hampshire, after being goaded repeatedly by the girls who called him Potter. Southampton Crown Court heard how Walker . returned to his family flat after shopping for his mother and he had to . pass 15-year-old Emma Keeble and 16-year-old Leah Pearce sitting on the stairs. One of the girls touched his shopping bag before verbally abusing him and telling him he resembled Harry Potter. Outraged Walker saw red, rushed to his flat before coming back downstairs with a milk bottle full of water and threw it over the girls. He then went back into the flat and re-emerged with a vegetable knife before walking to a local park - knowing the girls would follow him. Walker then lost his temper, stabbing Leah in the face, who then started bleeding profusely. He then turned his anger towards Emma, flooring her with a series of punches and kicks, before smashing her head against a fence. Scroll down for video . Bloodied: Emma Keeble, 15, pictured before her head was pushed into a fence by Walker, and afterwards .

Victim: Walker pleaded guilty to wounding with intent, attempting wounding with intent and possessing a bladed article after the attack on Emma (pictured) and Leah . After his arrest he made a full confession, describing his actions as ‘monstrous’. He pleaded guilty to wounding with intent, attempting wounding with intent and possessing a bladed article. Keely Harvey, defending, told the court he was bullied at school and seen as a ‘wimp’. She said: 'He finally lost it. He flipped and attacked them in this most horrific way, not justifiable, but I hope they can now see where it came from.' Passing sentence, Judge Peter Ralls QC, said the girls may have been rude, but there was no justification for what Walker did to them. Resemblance: Ryan Walker, 19, wears glasses and has short black hair, just like actor Daniel Radcliffe who plays the young wizard in the hit film series . Wizard: Harry Potter with friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) 'It was deliberate and planned,' he said. 'It was a sustained attack in which you used the knife as a weapon and your foot as a weapon.' Walker was sentenced to a jail term of four and a half years. After the hearing, Leah’s mum Claire Pearce, said: 'The injury has left a scar on Leah’s face that will be there for years. 'I don’t think the sentence was enough for what he did. He admitted he flipped and it was the final straw. 'I think he is a dangerous man given he flipped like that and attacked the girls.

"Hundreds of Jamaican prisoners are to stay in British jails at a cost of £27m a year after their government turned down a deal for them to be returned. The Ministry of Justice has been trying to persuade successive Jamaican governments to allow up to 737 prisoners to be returned to the island to serve sentences for crimes committed in the UK. A voluntary agreement to allow prisoner transfers was signed in 2007 but seven years later it has still not been ratified by the Jamaican parliament. Jamaicans make up the third largest number of foreign nationals in UK jails, after Polish and Irish, and they will be allowed to stay after their government rejected a new compulsory transfer agreement . And now a proposed compulsory deal to send the prisoners home has been rejected after the Jamaican government claimed it would be unconstitutional. The embarrassing snub is a further blow to British taxpayers, who already pay £400 million a year for the imprisonment of 10,600 foreigners from 157 countries. Conservative MP Philip Hollobone expressed anger at the attitude of the Jamaican Government and told the Times: ‘Given they are a Commonwealth country and they have the third highest number of foreign nationals in UK prisons, it ought to be a priority of the British Government to negotiate such an agreement as soon as possible.’ And previous attempts on the part of both Labour and the Coalition to transfer foreign prisoners have proved fruitless – because the prisoners have to consent to the move and can refuse on the grounds of human rights. David Cameron previously said UK taxpayers should fund foreign jails to enure that prisoners can be deported . Under the current voluntary deals, both countries, as well as the prisoner, must consent to the transfer, and there are fears that even with a compulsory deal prisoners can claim that being sent home will be a breach to their right to a family life. Jamaicans make up the third largest proportion of nationalities in our prisons, after Polish and Irish inmates, and an EU deal, which is expected to allow the compulsory transfer of hundreds of EU citizens when it comes into force this year, has exemptions for states with the highest number of people in jails. Irish prisoners will not routinely be considered for transfer because of the close links between the two countries, and Poland, which tops the list, has been given an opt-out until next year to ensure that its prisons can cope . Last year David Cameron announced UK taxpayers were to fund a major prison building programme in poor countries such as Nigeria and Jamaica, because no prisoners would choose to go to a foreign prison where conditions are worse than in British ones. At the time he said: ‘When people are sent to prison in the UK we should do everything we can to make sure that if they’re foreign nationals, they are sent back to their country to serve their sentence in a foreign prison.’ He added: ‘We should be using all of the influence we have to sign prisoner transfer agreements with those countries. Even if necessary frankly helping them to build prisons in their own country so we can send the prisoners home.’ Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers should not have to pay for what amounts to a bribe to boot out criminals who should not be here.’ It was found in 2012 that one in eight prisoners – 11,000 inmates - are clogging up our jails. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson told the Times: ‘We are currently providing Jamaica with advice on prison reform with a view to returning to discussions on this matter.’","Jamaicans make up third largest group of foreign nationals in UK jails .

"On Sunday evening, as England’s players were filing out of their charity ball, the lead singer of the Kaiser Chiefs shouted at them to come home ‘with the ******* trophy’. It was 11.30pm and the lead singer Ricky Wilson had the monied audience at the Grove Hotel in Hertfordshire in raptures as he belted out the band’s new track Coming Home. The Kaisers were the send-off act at the Lions and Roses dinner, a lavish affair put on by the England Footballers Foundation before their World Cup preparations started for real. VIDEO Scroll down for Gerrard: I'm proud to support the England Footballers Foundation . Well suited: England stars (from left) Frank Lampard, Ross Barkley, Glen Johnson, Ben Foster, James Milner, Luke Shaw, Gary Cahrll, Leighton Baines on the red carpet at Lions and Roses . Haul: These were just some of the items up for auction at England's money-raising charity gala . This is the unseen side of international football, when England's players put on their Marks & Spencers sponsored suits for formal occasions. During the 2013-14 season, Rays of Sunshine, the British Forces Foundation and the Bobby Moore Fund at Cancer Research UK have all benefited from the EFF. On this night alone, England’s players raised £362,000. It is an extraordinary sum of money, with various auction prizes fetching five figure sums from a room full of 500, mostly wealthy guests. Bidding to sit in Steven Gerrard’s executive box at Liverpool for one game and the chance to meet the England captain post-match fetched the best part of £30,000. An impromptu lot, proposed by event host Gabby Logan, to stand on the stage with the England squad for a ‘selfie’ was eventually sold for £12,000. A lot of drink had been taken by then, but it made somebody’s night. Then a round of golf with England keeper Joe Hart and Wayne Rooney went for more than £10,000 and six VIP nights in Las Vegas with three pals went for something similar. Towards the end of the evening, a random guest approached a member of staff at the FA and offered £1,000 for his official England tie. He instantly exchanged it on the proviso that it was the only item of clothing he was prepared to remove. It was quite a night. Even Roy Hodgson’s squad of players, who are used to earning extravagant sums of money with the top clubs in the Barclays Premier League, sat open-mouthed at the size of the bids. In an era when it is so easy to casually criticise the players, this event, in football parlance, could be described as ‘a leveller’. Every member of that squad, from captain Steven Gerrard and vice-captain Frank Lampard to Southampton trio Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Luke Shaw, understood their roles and responsibilities. It has to be said, it was pretty refreshing. Understanding their roles: The squad including (from left) Adam Lallana, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jack Wilshere and Raheem Sterling helped raise a lot of money . Many of them know that when it comes to the World Cup, with group games against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica to come, that it can get bloody. With the exception of Wayne Rooney (who was already in Portugal) and Jack Wilshere (excused until 11pm to celebrate Arsenal’s FA Cup success), every England player was in attendance. They sat on tables of 10 and were allowed, with the permission of the head coach Hodgson, a glass of wine or a glass of beer with their meal. They behaved impeccably. When the Kaisers’ lead singer jumped on to a table of England players singing their classic Oh My God, he thrust a microphone into James Milner’s face and demanded that he sang the chorus ‘I’ve never been this far away from home’. Hart was next and then Lallana, clearly hoping to avoid Wilson’s gaze, was suddenly belting it out for the benefit of the audience. They were good sports. Happy to help: Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jagielka were all smiles but the England players were gobsmacked by the amount of money raised . There was a good deal of respect in that room from the England squad as Terry Byrne, who runs the EFF on behalf of the players, spoke about the beneficiaries. In the past, financial support from the England Footballers Foundation has been sent to the earthquake victims in Haiti (2010). In 2012, when torrential rain forced England’s World Cup qualifier with Poland in Warsaw to be postponed for 24 hours, the players funded the extra night’s stay for the stranded fans. During Byrne’s passionate speech the players listened intently, never once wavering to mess about with their mobile phones or turn to each other to speak as Byrne outlined the Foundation’s aims. Good on them. Byrne, a former England team masseur who went on to manage David Beckham, explained that the squad’s match fees are diverted to the Foundation’s charity partners. The stage is set: Kaiser Chiefs performed their single Coming Home at the gala . It has been this way since 2007, when the more prominent and influential members of the England team generously decided to give them up in favour of charitable causes. As Byrne continued, they seek no publicity (he has no idea this has been written, for example) and there is very little knowledge of the EFF’s work. During the season, without fuss or fanfare, members of the squad commit to events all over country on behalf of the Foundation. They do it unflinchingly and judging by Byrne’s sentiments, along with the video presentation, the visits from England’s players make people’s day.","A chance to meet Steven Gerrard went for £30,000 .

"A billionaire businessman has been executed in Iran for his part in a $2.6 billion state bank scam following the largest fraud case since the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Mahafarid Amir Khosravi, also known as Amir Mansour Aria, was put to death at Evin prison, just north of the capital, Tehran, according to Iran's state television. The execution came after Iran's Supreme Court upheld his death sentence, but Khosravi's lawyer, Gholam Ali Riahi, claimed it was done in secret, and he was not given any notice his client's death. Mahafarid Amir Khosravi, pictured during his trial in February, has been executed in Iran for his part in a $2.6 billion state bank scam . Death sentences in Iran are usually carried out by hanging. 'I had not been informed about the execution of my client,' Mr Riahi told news website khabaronline.ir. 'All the assets of my client are at the disposal of the prosecutor's office.' State officials have not yet commented on Mr Riahi's claim. The fraud involved using forged documents to get credit at one of Iran's top financial institutions, Bank Saderat, and dated back to 2007. The credit was then used to purchase assets including state-owned companies such as major steel producer Khuzestan Steel Company. The execution came after Iran's Supreme Court upheld his death sentence, but Khosravi's lawyer, Gholam Ali Riahi, says he was not given any notice his client's death . Khosravi's business empire included more than 35 companies from mineral water production to a football club, as well as a firm importing meat from Brazil. According to Iranian media reports, the bank fraud began in 2007. A total of 39 defendants were convicted in the case. Four received death sentences, two got life sentences and the rest received sentences of up to 25 years in prison. The trials raised questions about corruption at senior levels in Iran's tightly controlled economy during the administration of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Mahmoud Reza Khavari, a former head of Bank Melli, another major Iranian bank, escaped to Canada in 2011 after he resigned over the case. He faces charges over the case in Iran and remains on the Islamic Republic's wanted list. Khavari previously admitted that his bank partially was involved in the fraud, but has maintained his innocence.","Mahafarid Amir Khosravi was put to death at Evin prison, near Tehran .

"A gunman who shot and killed a soldier at Canada's national war memorial and then stormed Parliament before he was gunned down had prepared a video recording of himself that reveals his ideological and political motives, police claim. The footage of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, which is yet to be released, is said to confirm investigators' fears that this was a meticulously planned terrorist attack. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson said in a statement they have 'persuasive evidence that Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's attack was driven by ideological and political motives.' Scroll down for video . 'Politically and ideologically motivated': Michael Zehaf-Bibeau filmed a message before he launched his attack . A detailed analysis of the video was being conducted and Paulson said they cannot release the video at this time. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has called Wednesday's shooting a terror attack, and the bloodshed raised fears that Canada is suffering reprisals for joining the U.S.-led air campaign against Islamic State extremists in Iraq and Syria. Police are investigating Zehaf-Bibeau's interactions with numerous individuals in the days leading up to the attack and whether they could have contributed or facilitated it. Paulson said a knife carried by Zehaf-Bibeau was taken from his aunt's property in Mont Tremblant, Quebec, and they're looking into how he got the rifle. Paulson called it an old, uncommon gun that police suspect he could have also hidden on the property. Paulson said investigators also identified where he got his money for the car he bought and his pre-attack activities. He said Zehaf-Bibeau has been employed in the oil fields in Alberta, saved his money and has access to a considerable amount of funds.

Tragic: Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24, (left) was killed by Zehaf-Bibeau (right) at the national war memorial . Masked and armed: Zehaf-Bibeau shot down two soldiers in a parking lot in Quebec, leaving one dead . 'The RCMP is confident we will have an authoritative and detailed account of the shooting, including a complete reconstruction of the heroic actions of those involved, in the weeks to come,' said Paulson, who also said the Ontario Provincial Police will investigate the shooting inside Parliament. Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, shot to death Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, who was assigned to the honor guard at the national war memorial. Zehaf-Bibeau was eventually gunned down inside Parliament by the sergeant-at-arms of the House of Commons, Kevin Vickers. The attack in Ottawa came two days after a man described as an 'ISIL-inspired terrorist' ran over two soldiers in a parking lot in Quebec, killing one and injuring the other before being shot to death by police. Mourning: Family attended a memorial in Hamilton, Ontario, for Cpl Cirillo on Sunday afternoon . Tributes: Hundreds have placed flowers by the book of condolence at the Markey-Dermody Funeral Home . Candlelit vigil: The community has been shaken by the bloody tirade that left the 24-year-old officer dead . The man had been under surveillance by Canadian authorities, who feared he had jihadist ambitions and seized his passport when he tried to travel to Turkey. Unlike the attacker in the Quebec case, Zehaf-Bibeau was not being watched by authorities. But Paulson said last week Zehaf-Bibeau, whose father was from Libya, may have lashed out in frustration over delays in getting his passport. Paulson said his mother told police that her son had wanted to go Syria. Susan Bibeau later denied that in a letter published by Postmedia News, saying her son told her he wanted to go to Saudi Arabia where he could study the Qu'ran.","Michael Zehaf-Bibeau shot soldier and stormed parliament on Wednesday .

Barca are keen to use the Chile international as a makeweight in their pursuit of Suarez - but Sanchez is understood to prefer a move to rivals Arsenal. And Gunners boss Arsene Wenger is set to grant the South American his wish by launching a move for the attacking midfielder. Scroll down to see Suarez to Barca talks open . No go: Alexis Sanchez says he would rather join Arsenal than Liverpool . Barca officials have arrived in London to start formal talks with Liverpool over their interest in Suarez. Liverpool, who are interested in Sanchez, want £80million for Suarez this summer. The Catalan club are prepared to use Sanchez, who is valued at £30m, as a sweetener in their offer for Suarez. But Sanchez looks likely to snub a move to Anfield, with his heart set on a switch to the Emirates Stadium. That means only a straight cash deal for Suarez is likely to be enough to persuade Liverpool to sees their prolific striker. Sources close to Sanchez have indicated that the 25-year-old would prefer a move to London, leaving Arsenal in pole position to land the talented forward. Barca chiefs yesterday ramped up their interest in Suarez by making the astonishing move of praising the Liverpool striker following his biting controversy. Star man: Sanchez was one of the key men for Chile at the World Cup . Missed opportunity: Sanchez missed in the penalty shoot out against Brazil as Chile were knocked out . Barca chiefs are fully aware that the potential capture of Suarez could be viewed as a massive PR own goal given the furore surrounding the South American. And the Catalan giants' took the unexpected step of praising Suarez for Monday's public apology to bite victim Giorgio Chiellini. It is understood Barca chiefs encouraged Suarez, who initially denied biting the Italy defender, to make the apology behind the scenes in an attempt to improve his public image in Spain. Fan: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is keen to launch a bid for Sanchez . And Barca sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta said: 'Suarez has shown he is humble enough to admit an error, which is very important. 'He has been humble enough to apologise to those he has affected, because it happened in the middle of a festival of football. 'In this case it's the best thing a person can do. 'Everyone knows that Luis is an excellent player, everyone knows last season he played in various positions in attack, but everyone also knows that he is a Liverpool player.' Barca bound: Luis Suarez is wanted by Barcelona - despite his lengthy ban . VIDEO Suarez to Barca talks open . And the praise of Suarez from Catalonia didn't stop there as the club's latest signing, Ivan Rakitic, also patted the striker on the back for his apology. The Croatian was officially unveiled at the Nou Camp yesterday and he said: 'The fact he has had the character and the strength to go in front of everyone and say sorry says a lot about him as a person. 'Not every person has that strength to admit they have done something stupid. I rarely say that I am wrong so this says a lot about him, he has shown the character and strength he has so he should be commended for that. 'Regardless of whether the club signs him or not, his quality is unquestionable. He has shown a lot of quality with Uruguay and scored more than 30 goals (last season) with Liverpool, so he has the necessary quality to play for Barca.'","Barcelona keen to use Sanchez as makeweight in bid to sign Luis Suarez .

"Manchester United have made a £56million bid for Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani, according to reports in Italy. Daily newspaper Tuttosport report that Cavani, who spent six years in Italy with Palermo and Napoli, is top of new United manager Louis van Gaal's wishlist.

"Command: Admiral Bill McRaven, commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command, addresses the National Defense Industrial Association in Washington . The commander of the Navy SEALs raids . which killed Osama bin Laden and rescued hostage Jessica Buchanan has . been berated by a retired Lt General for publicising such operations - . and putting future deployments at risk. Admiral Bill McRaven, who led the bin Laden raid and heads the U.S. Special Operations Command, was told by retired Army Lieutenant General James Vaught to 'get the hell out of the media' to safeguard the secrets and security of special operations. According to ABC News, Vaught told McRaven: 'Since the time when your wonderful team went and drug bin Laden out and got rid of him, and more recently when you went down and rescued the group in Somalia, or wherever the hell they were, they’ve been splashing all of this all over the media. 'I flat don’t understand that.' And he added: 'Back when my special operators extracted Saddam [Hussein] from the hole, we didn’t say one damn word about it. 'We . turned him over to the local commander and told him to claim that his . forces dug him out of the hole, and he did so. And we just faded away . and kept our mouth shut. 'Now . I’m going to tell you: one of these days, if you keep publishing how . you do this, the other guy’s going to be there ready for you, and you’re . going to fly in and he’s going to shoot down every damn helicopter and . kill every one of your SEALs. 'Now, watch it happen. Mark my words. Get the hell out of the media.' Scroll down for video . Response: Admiral McRaven said Vaught's was a 'great point', but that avoiding media coverage was almost impossible in the 24-hour news cycle . Breaking news: The daring rescue of Jessica Buchanan was heavily covered by the news channels . Captured: Osama bin Laden, pictured in Afghanistan before his death . But McRaven told his audience at the . National Defense Industrial Association in Washington, D.C. that . avoiding media coverage was almost impossible in the 24-hour news cycle, . and that while he objected to revealing sensitive tactics, the media . could be useful, even when reporting operations which had gone wrong. He joked that he became a Navy SEAL . because his sister was dating a special forces member and because he was . infatuated with John Wayne’s movie, 'The Green Beret'. Rescued: Hostage Jessica Buchanan who was rescued by U.S. special forces in Somalia last month . 'The . fact of the matter is, there have always been portrayals of SOF . [Special Operations Forces] out in the mainstream media,' he added. 'We . are in an environment today where we can’t get away from it. It is not . something that we actively pursue, as I think a number of the . journalists here in the audience will confirm. 'But . the fact of the matter is, with the social media being what it is . today, with the press and the 24-hour news cycle, it’s very difficult to . get away from it. 'But not only does the media focus on our successes, we . have had a few failures. And I think having those failures exposed in . the media also kind of helps focus our attention, helps us do a better . job. 'So sometimes the . criticism, the critique, the spotlight on us actually makes us better,' McRaven said, before adding that Vaught had made a 'great point' and they didn't want to get to the point where 'sensitive tactics, techniques and procedures are open for everybody to take a look at so that next time we come in on a target we are exposed'. The . raids on bin Laden and the compound where two western hostages were held in Somalia attracted . worldwide publicity.

The admiral added he was working to give his 66,000-person force — expected to grow to 70,000 over the next few years — more predictable schedules to reduce strain on families. He also spoke of working to break down the stigma of combat stress. 'If you have been engaged in this war for any length of time, you are fundamentally changed,' he said. But special operations troops typically don't seek help for emotional problems. 'I encourage them to come in. We're not going to pull their security clearances,' McRaven said. 'We're going to take care of them.'",Ex- Delta Force commander criticises publicising Osama and Jessica Buchanan missions .

"It was put on the market as a sign of solidarity by the king, to show his appreciation for the harsh austerity measures and rising unemployment rates facing his fellow Spaniards. But it seems times are so austere that those selling King Juan Carlos's luxury royal yacht have had to slash its asking price - by nearly 20 per cent. Fortuna, a . 136ft motor boat used exclusively by the Spanish Royal Family . and their guests - which has in the past included Princess Diana and Prince Charles - has had its price dropped from £8.1m to £6.6m. Reduced: Fortuna, the luxury royal yacht used exclusively by the Spanish Royal . Family, is on the market for £6.6m (€8.25) after King Juan Carlos decided to give . it up in a show of solidarity as Spain battled high levels of . unemployment and austerity . Famous faces: The boat has played host to several famous faces, including Princess . Diana, Prince Charles and Prince William, pictured here with King Juan . Carlos in 1990 . The boat, which remains moored off the island of Majorca, where the royal family has a palace and goes on holiday each summer, was gifted to the state by around 30 executives with . links to Majorca and other Balearic Islands in a bid to promote . the islands. But King Juan Carlos - who announced last week that he plans to abdicate to make way for his son Prince Felipe - was forced to renounce the use of the yacht, after coming under fire for going on an elephant safari in Bostwana in 2012, while the Spanish economy plunged further into crisis. The holiday came just weeks after the monarch - who won wide respect in Spain for helping guide it through a political transition after the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975 - claimed to be 'kept awake at night by the plight of the Spain's youth unemployed'. But after the king announced he would . hand over his prized possession, the group who bestowed the yacht, the Foundation of Balearic Culture and Tourism, said . they wanted it back. In a letter explaining their claim, they stressed . that the gift had been given with the understanding that the yacht be . used exclusively by the royal family. Now the 140-tonne vessel, which was . originally put on the market for the equivalent of €10m, has been . reduced to €8.25m. Spotted: Diana was seen on board the boat, which was bestowed to the king by the Foundation of Balearic Culture and Tourism in a bid to encourage tourism in the islands.

"Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy has likened the vice-president of the National Rifle Association (NRA) to a 'clown' after the body criticised his state's new tighter gun laws. Governor Malloy said the NRA's executive vice-president, Wayne LaPierre reminded him of the clowns at the circus.' 'They get the most attention. That's what he's paid to do,' he said. Last week Governor Malloy signed in to law some of the toughest gun control regulations anywhere in the US - in response to the Sandy Hook school shooting. 'Clown': Connecticut governor Dan Malloy (left) has likened NRA vice-president Wayne LaPierre (right ) to a clown. Mr LaPierre had criticised new gun control regulations signed by Governor Malloy last week . The nation was left in shock after Adam Lanza shot dead 20 children and six adults at the school in Newtown in December. The 20-year-old shot his . mother then went on to spray 155 bullets at innocent children and . educators during a five-minute, bloody rampage before shooting himself. The new Connecticut laws include the addition of more than 100 weapons to the state’s list of banned assault weapons. This includes the semi-automatic Bushmaster rifle, which was one of the guns used by Lanza during the massacre, according to CNN's Political Ticker blog. Among the other things banned are gun magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Laws: Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy signs far reaching gun control legislation into law last week . Momentus: The mother of a Sandy Hook victim Jackie Barden, looks on as Governor Malloy hugs her husband, Mark Barden, after signing the historic legislation . The new regulations also require gun owners to register pre-existing magazines which are bigger than the new limit - and made it illegal to bring this size of magazine into Connecticut from another state. Mr LaPierre said the 'criminals' who carry out 'horror and terror' are not going to cooperate with the new laws, and told Fox News that Governor Malloy was only 'making the law books bigger for law abiding people. Responding, Governor Malloy said Mr LaPierre was 'so out of whack it's unbelievable,' CNN . reports. Campaign: President Barack Obama will visit Connecticut as part of his efforts to get new gun control legislation through Senate . New York and Colorado have also passed stricter gun legislation following the Sandy Hook massacre. Governor Malloy said the majority of Americans wanted firmer gun control legislation. New national gun control legislation is currently sitting before the US Senate. The NRA, however, opposes that bill. The NRA has proposed the training and arming of adults to protect schools from potential attacks. Meanwhile, . President Barack Obama is trying to boost the chances of gun . legislation being passed by Senate by visiting Connecticut. Obama . plans to meet with Sandy Hook families and argue that lawmakers have an . obligation to the children killed and other victims of gun violence to . act on his proposals. Senators . have yet to reach a deal to pass expanded background checks for gun . sales. An assault weapons ban does not appear to have enough votes, and . the prospect for a ban on high-capacity magazines also appears bleak.","Dan Malloy said Wayne LaPierre reminded him of 'clowns at circus'

"A Pennsylvania state trooper who was injured when a gunman ambushed him and killed another trooper outside a police barracks is conscious and talking for the first time since he underwent surgery, a spokesman said Sunday. State police spokesman Trooper Tom Kelly said investigators hope to soon interview Trooper Alex Douglass to get additional information on the attack. The troopers were ambushed around 10:50 p.m. Friday as one of them was leaving the barracks and another was arriving. Cpl. Bryon Dickson of Dunmore was killed. Cpl. Byron Dickson was killed as he left the barracks in Blooming Grove, Pa. Pennsylvania State Police shows Trooper Alex Douglass. was injured in the ambush . Kelly said in an emailed statement Sunday that police are getting a large number of tips, and some are 'fantastic.' He said they are keeping details of the investigation quiet to preserve the integrity of the leads. Investigators on Sunday returned to scour the woods across from the barracks where they were ambushed. Troopers also set up a checkpoint near the site where they were stopping motorists to ask if they had seen anything that could help with the case, Kelly said. State Trooper Cpl. Bryon Dickson, 38, of Dunmore, Pa., was killed and Trooper Alex T. Douglass, 31, of Olyphant, Pa. was wounded after a shooting ambush at the barracks . A Pennsylvania State Trooper gestures to the media to not cross the street on Route 402, as he leads a team of troopers and members of the law enforcement conservation officers with the Pennsylvania Game Commission into a wooded area across from the police barracks . The developments come as a nonprofit group offered a $50,000 reward for tips about Friday's deadly assault at the remote post in northeast Pennsylvania. Reporters saw investigators walk into the dense forest surrounding the barracks in Blooming Grove around noon Sunday, though authorities suggested a day earlier that the suspect had already left the area. Police said there would be no news conference Sunday. 'Our troopers were ... shot without warning and really had no chance to defend themselves,' Noonan told reporters Saturday afternoon. 'It has touched us to the core that such a thing could happen' Pennsylvania State Troopers work a checkpoint on Route 402 . Dickson, a seven-year veteran, had transferred to the region from the Philadelphia barracks several months ago. Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said the 'cowardly attack' was directed at state police and a 'very dangerous, armed criminal' eluded quick capture.

Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said the 'cowardly attack' was directed at state police and a 'very dangerous, armed criminal' eluded quick capture . Pennsylvania Crime Stoppers, which posted the reward offer, asked anyone with information to call 800-4PA-TIPS or submit the tip online. Law enforcement officers from at least three states on Saturday searched state game lands surrounding the barracks in Pike County and beyond. 'There has been an exhaustive search conducted by hundreds of members of law enforcement,' said Lt. Colonel George Bivens. 'We have canvassed the wooded areas, neighborhoods. We are convinced this individual is no longer in that immediate area.' Police interviewed a man they called a 'person of interest,' but Noonan said authorities are talking to hundreds of people as part of the investigation. He stressed the man is not a suspect. The slain trooper was married with two young sons. He was described by friends as devoted to work and family. A Pennsylvania State Trooper walks into a wooded area as investigators return to scour the woods across the street from the state police barracks .

"Charged: Shaquille Jones, 21, was charged with murder and two first-degree home invasion . Two suspects in the fatal shooting of a University of Michigan medical student say they sneaked into Paul DeWolf's basement bedroom at his medical fraternity during a burglary attempt and that his shooting was unintended, according to police statements. The Detroit Free Press reported today that it obtained police statements from two men jailed on murder and home invasion charges in the death of Paul DeWolf, a 25-year-old prospective surgeon whose body was found July 24. According to the statements, the suspects and a third man not yet charged in the case broke into Phi Rho Sigma medical fraternity and entered DeWolf's basement bedroom, startling him. DeWolf went to get something from his dresser and one of the suspects tried to strike him with the gun, but it fired instead, according to the statements. Ann Arbor police Detective Katie Nucci recounted the statements at a November 22 warrant hearing for Joei Jordan, 20, and Shaquille Jones, 21, the newspaper said. Using data about a stolen computer, investigators tracked Jordan to Sumter County, S.C., and Jones to North Charleston, S.C. A third suspect accused of firing the gun is jailed in Michigan on a bond violation in another case but hasn't been charged in DeWolf's killing. Scroll down for video . Victim: Paul DeWolf was found dead in his bedroom in a fraternity house in Ann Arbor, Michigan on July 24 . In her testimony, Nucci said Jordan entered through an open rear window as Jones and the third man, 21-year-old Dajeon Franklin, remained outside. Jordan emerged a short time later with a PlayStation 3, taken from a basement recreation room in the house and hidden in his backpack, the detective said. Joei Jordan, 20, was also arraigned on murder charges . Jordan . climbed back through the window and let the other two in through a rear . door, Jones told detectives. Eventually, they ended up in the basement, . where they hid in a utility closet when they heard two students coming . down a hallway, Nucci testified. The three of them then made their way to the room where DeWolf lived and entered. Jones . said DeWolf got out of bed 'and was asking what was going on', the . detective testified. She said Jones told investigators that the third . suspect 'pulled out a handgun and pointed it' at the medical student and 'ordered DeWolf not to move'. 'At some point DeWolf grabbed . something off of his desk and/or drawer' and started to move toward the . third suspect, at which time the man 'raised the gun and attempted to . strike DeWolf with the gun, and the gun at that time fired.' DeWolf screamed, and the suspects ran off, Nucci testified. The next court dates are Thursday for Jones and December 12 for Jordan. Franklin has not been charged yet. Crime scene: Police tape is put around the student home of Paul DeWolf after his body was discovered on July 24 . DeWolf was an enlisted second lieutenant in the United States Air Force and was . studying at university to complete his surgical training.

'I have no tears for him,' Thom DeWolf, Paul's father, said at his funeral on Sunday. 'He is released. He is in heaven.' Another of his close friends, Jason Halterman said that DeWolf had an infectious love of life. 'He loved everyone regardless,' said Halterman to ABC News. 'He taught me to be a better, more caring person and I love him for it.' Police say DeWolf failed to arrive for a scheduled assignment at the Veteran's Affairs Hospital. DeWolf was a frequent poster to Facebook about his passion for scuba diving and running marathons. He was the captain of the cross country team at Schoolcraft High School and graduated as class valedictorian in 2006. He . took his bachelors degree in bio-medical sciences from Grand Valley .

A statement from the university said that DeWolf was the 'epitome of everything great in the field of medicine.' 'We extend our deepest condolences to Paul's family, friends and colleagues,' UM president Coleman added to the statement. 'He . was working and training among a close, nurturing community of healers . and I know they will help each other through this difficult time.

Michelle Obama said problems with girls’ education often stemmed from traditional 'attitudes and beliefs' that exist even in the United States and lead to issues such as the gender pay gap and an under-representation of women in leadership. She said men worldwide needed to 'look into their hearts and souls and ask if they truly view women as their equals.' 'I am who I am today because of the people in my family, particularly the men in my family, who valued me and invested in me from the day I was born,' Obama said. 'And as I grew up, the men who raised me set a high bar for the type of men I’d allow into my life - which is why I went on to marry a man who had the good sense to fall in love with a woman who was his equal, to treat me as such - a man who supports and reveres me, and who supports and reveres our daughters as well,' Obama said.

"Record-breaking goose has delighted her farmer by laying ten times more eggs than normal and is now on course for early retirement. Gloucestershire farmer Bill Osborne, 69, adores his goose called Lucy who has popped one out every other day for the last three months. Farmyard geese normally lay a clutch of around 15 eggs in Spring and then no more for the rest of the year. Grateful: Mr Osborne is happy to keep his goose Lucy as a pet when she retires . Delighted: Farmer Bill Osborne, 69, whose goose Lucy has laid a record breaking number of eggs . But Mr Osborne was shocked and delighted when he discovered Lucy had started laying out of season in October. Since then the mother goose hasn’t stopped - laying an egg without fail every other day for the past four months. Two-year-old Lucy has kept Mr Osborne and his wife Sue busy collecting eggs through the winter - and making a mountain of cakes and omelettes. The farmer said: 'I have had poultry all my life and I’ve never had a bird do this before. Lucy laid 15 eggs in February but left her nest after a month. 'Then in October she began laying eggs out of nowhere - we’ve had one every other day without fail since then. Broody: record-breaking Lucy who has been laying ten times more eggs than other less prolific geese . Lucy is not your average goose as she is an Embden breed, traditionally heavier and larger than a typical goose bred for commercial output. 'So far she’s laid more than 70 eggs and that’s just the ones we know about. 'She also goes off to lay eggs by the hedge in the field but the crows get to them before we do.' Geese are born with all the eggs they will ever lay already inside them as undeveloped yolks. But with Lucy laying at her current record-breaking rate she may run out of eggs within a few years. Mr Osborne, who farms in Lydney, Gloucestershire, said: 'I am just wondering how long she will keep it up. 'Geese normally go on laying for . around 16 years but Lucy could finish her lifetime supply of eggs in the . next three years - and she is only four-years-old now. 'If that happens then we will keep her as a pet - I think she will have earned an early retirement after all that.' Denise . Moss, secretary of the Goose Club of Great Britain, said she had never . heard of an Embden goose like Lucy laying so many eggs. She said: 'That is most unusual in an Embden. Most geese lay from February to May. 'Other breeds will quite often lay a clutch in October but we’ve never heard of an Embden laying so well and for so long.' Early retirement: Lucy could finish her lifetime supply of eggs in the next three years .

"Disgraced pervert Jonathan King today said serial predatory rapist Jimmy Savile was innocent. The 69-year-old former music mogul branded the dead DJ's victims his 'accusers', in an outburst that will appall those abused Savile. King, who was jailed for seven years in 2001 for sexually assaulting five teenage boys, made the shocking statement in his column for the prison newspaper Inside Time. He still refuses to admit to his crimes, but was released from prison in 2005. Appalling outburst: Disgraced pervert Jonathan King (left) today said serial predatory rapist Jimmy Savile (right) is innocent. Writing in his Inside Time column, the 69-year-old said: 'He was an innocent man' The pervert, who still protests his innocence, said Savile is an 'innocent man' in the eyes of the law. King, who discovered the band Genesis and fronted the BPI Awards - now the BRITS - in 1987, said Savile was not a 'serial rapist', despite hundreds of complaints of abuse by the presenter. Writing his monthly column, King lambasted the media for calling Savile a rapist, adding: 'He (Savile) wasn’t. 'He was an innocent . man unless, of course, (newspapers) agree with the current legal . premise that an accused person is guilty until or unless he or she can . prove themselves innocent. 'That applies dead or alive, doesn’t it, unless we must believe the media always carries the truth.' Guilty: King, 69, was jailed in 2001 for seven years after being found guilty of sexually abusing five teenage boys. He protests his innocence in his monthly column while claiming that those abused by Savile should be referred to as 'accusers' rather than his victims because the pervert DJ never appeared in court . He claimed Savile's hundreds of victims should be referred to as 'accusers', due to the fact Savile never appeared in court. Addressing his own crimes, the 69-year-old, said he has been provoked by the recent aquittal of celebrities including Coronation Street actors Michael Le Vell and Bill Roache. He said juries in those cases did not believe the crimes had taken place, and were 'at worst fiction, at best exaggeration'. King claims the jury in his case should have come to the same conclusion. He adds: 'The crimes never happened. At least miscarriages of justice in cases of murder have bodies to show that crimes did take place. If I’d been tried now, instead of 14 . years ago, when the ages of consent had only just been equalised thanks . to the EU and to the fury of homophobes, I would certainly have been . found innocent.' Report: Dame Janet Smith, a former court appeal judge, is compiling a report on the Savile scandal investigating whether the BBC 'turned a blind eye' to the former DJ's offending, allowing him to rape and sexually assult hundreds of victims . King became known to millions of TV viewers after fronting BBC2’s Entertainment USA show in the 1980s .

"Angry residents: Linda and Mick Crundell, John Wade and Max Smith . For decades Ings Lane was a dirty and pothole-strewn disgrace, unbefitting of a respectable residential neighbourhood. Despite the regular pleas from homeowners, the council refused to resurface the street, insisting it was not its legal responsibility. Desperate residents finally solved the problem by paying £6,000 to have the road professionally re-surfaced, with three speed bumps as an additional safety measure. But incredibly, the council have now threatened to undo their good work by digging up the road they have had lovingly resurfaced - and threatening the residents with arrest. The council officials - who had previously insisted the road did not fall under its jurisdiction - sent workmen to examine the lane immediately when a local farmer complained about the new road humps. Then, three weeks ago, it sent workers to dig up the road to remove the humps. On this occasion they were persuaded to stop by residents who rushed outside to plead with them. However, council officials have now told furious residents that despite their previous attitude they have authority over the road after all and the ‘illegal’ speed bumps will have to go. Homeowners have even been threatened with arrest if they try to stop workers removing them next time. The farce has left the families living in the five detached properties alongside the resurfaced 60-metre stretch of road in a state of utter disbelief. Wealthy entrepreneur John Wade, 36, described the council as ‘inept.’ ‘The council claimed the road wasn’t theirs when we needed work doing but now the work has been done they are saying it is an adopted road. It is ridiculous.’ Puddles: The road's potholes filled with water whenever it rained . For more than 20 years the state of the road in the village of Arksey, near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, severely damaged the quality of life. The unsurfaced road was riddled with potholes, which damaged cars and was a constant nuisance for pedestrians. It was muddy in wet weather and dusty in dry conditions. Children in one family were sent to school with plastic bags on their feet due to the mud and dust thrown up by vehicles was so bad that residents had to keep their windows shut in the height of summer. Very occasionally the council temporarily patched up the worst holes to placate residents, but no long term repairs were done. In March a private contractor hired by residents totally re-surfaced the stretch of road and residents also laid grass verges to improve appearance and pedestrian safety. It transformed their lives in the summer, with children able to ride bikes and parents safely pushing buggies. But the council’s U-turn means the new traffic calming measures are set to be removed. Pensioner Mick Crundell, 66, has lived there for 20 years with wife Linda, 64. He said: ‘The council have always said it is an unadopted road and not their responsibility. It doesn’t make sense that we’ve been complaining to them for decades to get the road fixed and yet after one complaint and no investigation they come and start digging up our new road. ‘Now they are happy for the road that the residents put in to stay but are saying the road is theirs and the bumps have to go. Does that mean they are going to now foot the bill for the work that has already been done? We feel completely let down by the council.’ Got the hump: The farce has left the families living in the five detached properties alongside the resurfaced 60-metre stretch of road in a state of utter disbelief . Mrs Crundell said they felt ‘bullied’ by the local authority for wanting to make their street ‘a nicer and safer place to live.’ Mr Wade, his wife Donna, 35, and their two children live in a large house with a swimming pool. He said: ‘Everybody that lives here wants the bumps to stay in place. The council won’t spend money to fix potholes but they will spend the money to dig up part of a highway that people who live there actually want. ‘It is a total waste of taxpayers’ money. One council worker even threatened to bring us all in under caution until we admitted who paid for the work to be done.’ Bumped off: Despite previously stating the road was not theirs to maintain, the council has now decided to dig up the new speed bumps - and have anyone who tries to stop them arrested . Mother-of-two Maxine Smith, 44, and her electrical engineer husband Paul, 42, are also furious. She said: ‘The potholes damaged my car. We even considered moving at one point. It just made life difficult. Having the new road was amazing, and safer. It makes the whole street a nicer place to be. It’s a waste of time and money to start digging things up again.’ Officials from Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council insist the speed bumps must be removed because they were put in without permission and ‘raise serious liability issues.’ They are described as ‘not fully visible in the dark, illegal and potentially dangerous.’ However, the council hopes to reduce the speed limit to 20mph. Peter Dale, Doncaster council’s director of regeneration and environment, said: ‘This section of Ings Lane has no history of accidents in the past 10 years and is used by just a small number of residents and agricultural vehicles. There are 1,000 miles of roads across Doncaster and we have to prioritise major routes and accident hotspots. Ings Lane has been maintained in a safe and serviceable condition in keeping with the nature of the road.’ Unadopted roads are not maintained by the highway authority and in residential areas are usually the responsibility of owners whose properties front on to the road.","Ings Lane, near Doncaster, had been dirty and pothole-ridden for decades .

"A graveyard of brown bears, cruelly slain and mutilated by poachers, has been uncovered in Siberia. The animals were beheaded and their body parts are believed to have been exported to China as delicacies or for medicinal purposes. A hunting expert called in to analyse the horrifying discovery in Buryatia, Russia confirmed that all the bears, including several young creatures, were violently trapped and slain according to the Siberian Times. Beheaded bears: Nine skulls were found and it is believed that poachers beheaded the brown bears and exported their other body parts to China for delicacies or medicinal purposes . Poachers' work: All were shot at close range in the head which suggests they were caught in illegal bear traps before they were killed . Like Gulag victims of Stalin's political purges, the bears were all shot at close range in the skull after they had been illegally snared in traps. Biologist Bimba Yumov said: ‘The brown bears were killed in the most barbaric way. ‘Poachers put the traps out which even the bears cannot escape from then came to finish the animals with the shot to the head. ‘The bears were sitting, trapped, like chained dogs. ‘This was the only way the poachers could have shot them in the head.’ Final resting place: It is believed that the bears were trapped and killed in a remote location in winter before they were poorly hidden in the frozen ground of the graveyard . Russia's favourite: Russia has the largest brown bear population in the world, and it is one of the most widespread, well-known and popular animals in the country . The biologist said the bear deaths were definitely the work of poachers using traps. She . said: 'If it was the usual type of hunting, with the bear freely . walking around, they would not have been able to get the animals in . their heads, it is extremely unlikely. They would aim at other parts of . their bodies. ‘I am 100 per cent confident that . this was the work of poachers. You will not otherwise have nine skulls . with identical type of bullet shots.’ The . bears were found in the macabre forest cemetery 'skinned and their paws . hacked off. Fat and bile was also removed', it is claimed. Graveyard location: The remains were found in Ulan-Ude, the capital city of the Republic of Buryatia, Russia . They were slain last winter, say experts. According . to the Siberian Times: ‘The fear is that the poaching was undertaken as . an order from the Chinese black market where bear products have a high . value as delicacies and for medicinal purposes. ‘The remains were most likely brought to the “graveyard” in winter and not hidden properly in the frozen ground. ‘The . animals were found close to a suburb of the Buryatian capital of . Ulan-Ude, but it is likely they were trapped and killed in a more remote . location.’ All that was left: Only the bear skulls were found. They were skinned, had their paws hacked off, and fat and bile removed it has been claimed . Mushroom pickers made the gruesome discovery and alerted the local Channel 5 TV station in regional capital Ulan-Ude. Police doubt the poachers will ever be identified and punished. Recently, in a separate case, customs officers close to the Russian-Chinese border detained a Mercedes with 115 bear paws. It is estimated that black market price for a kilogram of brown bear's paw is about US$1000. Spokesman for Blagoveschensk Customs Vitaliy Shabanov said: ‘We catch this kind of illegal cargo once every three months. ‘It is one of the most widespread types of smuggling here.’ Russia has the largest brown bear population in the world, and it is one of the most widespread, well-known and popular animals in the country.

"George Zimmerman is speaking out about the Trayvon Martin killing for the first time in an interview with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity. Friends and family members have told the neighborhood watch volunteer's side of the story since the controversial killing in February, but Zimmerman himself has remained silent. The interview comes one day after it was revealed that Zimmerman and his wife blew through $36,000 of cash he raised from his online legal defense fund on personal expenses like car payments, cell phones and paying off credit card debt -- even though he was in jail at the time. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Opening up: Donations poured in on George Zimmerman's fundraising website after he spoke exclusively to Fox News's Sean Hannity . He went into hiding because he received . thousands of death threats after he was initially not arrested because . he claimed he opened fire on the unarmed teen in self defense. 'Zimmerman will open up about what happened the night of Trayvon Martin’s death and his experience in the aftermath of the fatal shooting,' Fox News says. The hour-long interview will air tonight at 9pm on Fox News. Zimmerman appeared alongside his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, and talked about what led up to and what followed the shooting. The interview is the culmination of several months of work by Hannity to land the exclusive interview. Uproar: With all that has been said about the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, the public had never heard Zimmerman's story from the man himself . In 18 days in jail, George Zimmerman and his wife spent $36,000 on personal expenses, according to court filings by his lawyer, Mark O'Mara. Those expenses include: . Credit card bills: $7,000 . Money for bail: $5,000 . Car payments and rental: $4,300 . Repaying loan from parents: $3,000 . Land line telephone: $2,500 . Rent: $1,900 . Food: $1,300 . AT&T wireless Internet: $1,300 . Gas: $800 . Jail commissary: $800 . Jail calling cards: $600 . Utilities: $400 . New phones: $300 each . In April, at the height over the public uproar over the shooting, Zimmerman called Hannity and had an off-the-record conversation with him. The details of the call have never been made public. The interview is also expected to discuss the $200,000 in donations he received from supporters via a PayPal he set up on his site therealgeorgezimmerman.com. Court filings from O'Mara show that in 18 days, Zimmerman and his wife spent $36,000 to pay off credit card bills, buy phones, make car payments and pay for an Internet connection -- all of it while he was still in jail. Among the expenses were $600 in jailhouse phone calls. Zimmerman, 28, spent three to five hours a day on the phone while he was in jail -- placing an average of 13 calls to friends and family each day, the Orlando Sentinel reports. In many of those calls Zimmerman used code to talk about money, especially from the PayPal account, . The biggest single chunk of money was a $5,000 payment for Zimmerman's first bail, which was set at $150,000. However, the couple spent $7,000 to pay down credit card bills -- $4,000 on their America Express bill alone. O'Mara says the bills were for expenses the Zimmerman incurred when they had to flee their home after they began receiving death threats. They used $4,400 to make payments on two cars and $1,500 to rent a third car. Gas was $800. Both Zimmerman and his wife Shellie bought new phones for $300 each and paid up front for a two-year contract. A telephone land line and AT&T Internet were installed at the Zimmermans' safe house for $2,500 and $1,300, respectively. All of these expenses, O'Mara argues, were 'judicious' use of the the cash sent by supporters. After the living expenses were covered, the Zimmermans kept $20,000 for additional cash and turned the rest -- $123,000 over to O'Mara to be put in a legal defense fund.","Zimmerman had called Hannity and spoken with him off-the-record in April .

"An unsettling video has emerged purporting to show Islamic State fighters bartering over Yazidi women at a slave girl 'market'. The terror organisation recently boasted of enslaving women from the Iraqi ethnic minority, and the men appearing in the clip explain it is 'slave market day'. The clip shows the men negotiating the price of the women, with blue and green-eyed young girls fetching a higher price. Scroll down for video . Disturbing: The clip begins with this bearded Islamic State fighter explaining it is slave 'distribution day' 'We should have our share': ISIS have said captured Yazidi women are divided 'according to Sharia law' One unidentified man, pictured left, says he is searching for a girl while another man sitting next to him laughs . Who wants to sell? A man asks who has a slave to sell and one is quickly found and negotiations begin . Exchange: The seller quickly reveals he is happy to part with his young slave girl for Glock pistol . Haggle: But the buyers want to know what the girl looks like before they name a price . It starts with one man saying to the camera: 'Today is the slave market day. Today is the day where this verse applies: 'Except with their wives and the (captives) whom their right hands possess, - for (then) they are not too be blamed'. He added: 'Today is distribution day God willing. Each one takes his share.' Another then says: 'I swear man I am searching for a girl. I hope I find one.' The men laugh and another says: 'Today is the day of (female) slaves and we should have our share.' Bartering begins after a seller is found, who says he is happy to sell his slave for a Glock pistol. Sellers offer prices, with one going as high as five banknotes. Subtitles on the clip explain that one banknote is probably the equivalent of 100 dollars. Barter: The men begin to negotiate a price with the seller, with some offering money and one offering a gun . Picky: But the buyers explain the price depends on the young girl's looks and they will need to check her teeth . But the buyers explain the price they are willing to pay depends on looks and they will need to verify the girl is to their liking. One says he would need to check the teeth of the 15-year-old being auctioned, and explains: 'If she doesn't have teeth, why would I want her?' The video was shot in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, which was seized by ISIS in June, according to Al Aan TV - who translated the clip into English. The group have been reported as saying that Yazidi women and children captured during the offensive in Sinjar town were divided among fighters 'according to sharia law'. Valuable: Blue and green eyes are preferred by the men, who say they will offer a higher price . The men offer money in terms of banknotes, which an English translation says is around 100 dollars . Teeth: But negotiations later stall when it appears the girl, thought to be aged 15, may be missing some teeth . Last month, a young Yazidi woman forced into sex slavery by the Islamic State claimed militants raped her 30 times in just a few hours. The unidentified woman is understood to have been kept as a prisoner of the jihadists somewhere in western Iraq having been captured by ISIS during the Sinjar massacre in early August. She allegedly told the fighters she had been raped so frequently that she could no longer use the toilet, adding the ordeal has been so harrowing that she plans to commit suicide even if freed. And a 15-year-old girl told how she escaped militants by drugging and shooting two husbands who bought her as a slave. The teenager, who has been kept anonymous to protect her family, was one of hundreds of women from the Yazidi sect who extremists kidnapped after overrunning their homes on Iraq's Mount Sinjar. The UN have confirmed that thousands of Yazidis were slaughtered when ISIS swept through northern Iraq in August. Researchers concluded that more than 5,000 Yazidi were gunned down in a series of massacres by jihadists. Thousands of women are also being held in makeshift detention centres, where they either been taken away and sold into slavery or handed over to jihadists as concubines. The clip begins with one man addressing the camera: Today is the slave market day. Today is the day where this verse applies: 'Except with their wives and the (captives) whom their right hands possess, - for (then) they are not too be blamed'. Today is distribution day God willing. Each one takes his share. Another then says: I swear man I am searching for a girl. I hope I find one. Another adds: Today is the day of (female) slaves and we should have our share. The bartering begins with the words: Who wants to sell? The seller's reply: I want to sell. Why? I pay three banknotes (Subtitles explain one banknote is probably 100 dollars) I buy her for a pistol. The price differs if she has blue eyes. The seller replies: I will sell her for a Glock! I pay five banknotes. It depends on how she looks like. If she is 15 years old, I have to check her... Check her teeth. If she has green eyes... If she doesn't have teeth, why would I want her?","Terror group boasts it has enslaved women from Yazidi sect .

"His remarkably candid images of some of the most violent conflicts of the first half of the 20th century were unlike any seen in the world of photojournalism before and led to him being labelled the 'greatest war photographer in the world'. But Robert Capa is said to have hated the subject that he made his name shooting with his trusty 35mm camera. The photographer, who would have been 100 this week, was there when Allied troops stormed the beach at Omaha in 1944, and witnessed the brutal civil war that ripped apart Spain for much of the later 1930s. Iconic: Perhaps Robert Capa's most famous photograph - Death of a Loyalist Soldier - which was taken in Cordoba, Spain in 1936. Capa would have been 100 this week . Welcoming: This picture of civilians lining the streets of Monreale just outside Palermo, Italy, was taken in July 1943 . Joint effort: In Paris in 1944 following the entry of the French 2nd Armored Division, numerous pockets of German snipers had to be rooted out - many civilians joined troops in the fighting . POW: A German soldier after he had been captured by American troops near Nicosia in July 1943 . He was on hand to chronicle some of the most important moments in world history in the last century and his photos of the D Day landings in particular offer the most vivid depiction of the bloody but crucial invasion of France. Capa was born Andre Friedmann in Hungarian capital Budapest in 1913 but moved to Berlin when he was 17 enrolling in the Deutsche Hochschule Fur Politik where he studied journalism and political science while working part time in a dark room. He remained in Berlin until Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and the rise of the Nazis gained pace, moving to Paris. Along with his companion Gerda Jaro, Capa made regular trips to Spain between 1936 and 1939 to photograph the Spanish Civil War. During that time he took arguably his most famous photograph - Death of a Loyalist Soldier - which graphically depicted the death of anarchist Federico Borrell García. Poignant: An American soldier pictured smiling and walking hand in hand with three British orphans who were adopted by his unit . Faithful companion: An American soldier pictured petting a puppy during the Second World War . Goodbye: Spanish soldiers bid farewell to their loved ones before the departure of a military train to the Aragon front . Musical: This picture was taken on a train between Memphis and Hot Springs in the U.S in 1940 . He also travelled to China in 1938 to document resistance to the Japanese invasion there. The Picture Post described him as the 'greatest war photographer in the world' later the same year. Capa fled to America when the Second World War started and began working as a freelance photographer for LIFE, Time and several other publications. From 1941 until 1946, Capa was war correspondent for LIFE and Collier's and travelled with the U.S Army. He captured Allied victories in North Africa, the Normandy landings in 1944 and the capture of Leipzig, Nuremberg and Berlin. Famous face: Negatives showing Leon Trotsky lecturing in Copenhagen in November 1932 . Funny men: Capa took this image of members of the Laurel and Hardy fan club in Paris in 1937 . Famous subject: Writer Ernest Hemmingway pictured in Sun Valley, Idaho, in 1940 . Following the war, he co-founded the Magnum photo agency before heading to Israel to capture the turmoil surrounding the country's declaration of independence between 1948 and 1950. Not just a war photographer, Capa also met and photographed the likes of Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemmingway and Leon Trotsky. The photographer became a casualty of war himself in 1954. Capa travelled to Hanoi to cover the French war in Indochina but was killed when he stepped on a landmine shortly after arriving. He was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre with Palm by the French and the Robert Capa Gold Medal Award for excellence in the field of photojournalism was established the year after his death. Robert Capa's 11 surviving close up photographs . of the Omaha beach landings on June 6 1944 earned the nickname the . 'Magnificent Eleven' but he had in fact taken 106 photographs while . wading through the water. The images were sent to Life . magazine's office in Britain where picture editor John Morris told staff . in the dark room to 'rush!' as they did the developing. In their haste, worker Dennis Banks . shut the doors on a wooden locker where the film was drying and 95 of . the images melted as the negatives were destroyed. Iconic: One of Capa's 11 surviving photos of Allied troops invading Normandy in June 1944 . Three whole rolls were lost, and more . than half of the fourth.The useless film was tossed in a dustbin that . same night and lost forever. There were no other pictures taken . from so close to the frontline landings on D-Day so The Magnificent . Eleven provide the only enduring images from Normandy. He later wrote in his book, called . Slightly out of Focus: 'The men from my barge waded in the water. Waist-deep, with rifles ready to shoot, with the invasion obstacles and . the smoking beach in the background gangplank to take my first real . picture of the invasion.

"Byn Nguyen (pictured), was cleared by a judge at Hull Crown Court of running a cannabis factory despite ‘probably being involved’. An illegal immigrant from Vietnam was allowed to walk free from court in farcical circumstances after a judge tried to ensure he was held for deportation. Byn Nguyen, 19, was cleared by a judge at Hull Crown Court of running a cannabis factory despite ‘probably being involved’. He had originally tried running away when found hiding at the property by police and spent six months in custody before his case went to trial. Fearing he would flee the authorities and ‘evaporate into the black economy’ after his release, Judge Jeremy Richardson, QC, asked that the Home Office be alerted so that officials could detain him. Police were also made aware of the situation and the judge’s fears Nguyen may disappear again. But two hours after his trial collapsed Nguyen was released by security guards at Hull Crown Court because no one had come to collect him and there were no warrants against his name. The Vietnamese teenager had been given £50 to catch a train and was expected to travel 100 miles to Solihull to hand himself in to be processed by the Home Office. The incident happened on Tuesday and yesterday there was no word as to whether Nguyen followed orders or vanished into the night as the judge feared he would. Nguyen was charged with production of cannabis between January and May this year after he was arrested at a house in Goole, East Yorkshire, containing £24,000 of the drug. Police found his finger prints on two cups and a can of drink at the property and the prosecution claimed his job was to fertilise the plants and control their lighting. After prosecutor Stephen Robinson outlined the Crown’s case the judge ordered the jury to return a not guilty verdict due to insufficient evidence. Judge Richardson told the jury the fingerprint evidence did not prove he was involved in the drug production as ‘mere presence at the scene was not enough’ to prove guilt. He said the defendant’s claim to have been at the house one night seemed like ‘a tall story’ and ‘has a nasty smell.’ He told the jury: ‘You may have reached the view, as I have, that he was probably involved. It is highly questionable what he did. But probable is not a crime.’ The judge continued: ‘He will have to be reported to the Home Office. I am going to release him very shortly indeed. I would like the Home Office to know of this immediately, otherwise I think he will evaporate into what is described as the black economy.’ Judge Richardson then told the defendant: ‘You are an illegal immigrant. You should not be in the UK. I have no idea how you got here. 'That is for the Home Office to sort out. I think it highly likely that you will be deport and not allowed back in the UK or any other European state. For you it is a pyrrhic victory as you will be sent back to Vietnam.’ Two hours after his trial collapsed Nguyen was released by security guards at Hull Crown Court (pictured) because no one had come to collect him and there were no warrants against his name . Nguyen was crying in the dock but stopped when his interpreter told him he had been cleared. The defendant then held his hands as if in prayer. The judge told him he had received papers to go to Solihull and could make an application for asylum at that point. The police officer in the case was at Hull Crown Court and told of the judge’s request to alert the Home Office. No officials arrived and it is believed police took no action as they had no legal right to detain him. After being released from the cells Nguyen was asked what he was going to do and said: ‘Where is the train station?’ He then walked off. A source from the G4S security company said: ‘This is not the first time. We are fed up of it frankly. We had an illegal immigrant we released from Grimsby Crown Court last Friday. 'We rang up the Home Office and they said “there is nobody here. Its 3pm. Tell him to come and see us on Monday.” So we just let him go from cells.’ Humberside Police have declined to comment. A Home Office spokesperson said 'we do not comment on individual cases.'","Byn Nguyen was cleared of running a cannabis factory despite 'probably being involved'

"A neighbours’ dispute over £16.99 wind chimes hanging in a garden has ended in an expensive criminal trial and left a police sergeant’s career in ruins. Paul Duke, a police officer married to a detective, was caught on CCTV climbing over his neighbour’s 6ft high fence, taking his wind chimes and returning to his own garden to put them on a bonfire. Neighbour Edmund Looby, 42, and his teacher wife Tatiana, 39, had upset Duke by complaining to the council about fires he had been lighting to burn rubbish during house renovation work. Scroll down for video . CCTV captures the moment police officer Paul Duke looks  over the fence of his neighbour, Edmund Looby,  in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, before taking wind chimes following a row over bonfire smoke . After checking that the coast was clear, Duke was seen jumping over the fence and heading for the chimes . The Loobys reported the theft incident to police and Duke, 45, told investigators the chimes belonged to him and he was ‘recovering his own property.’ The ‘bizarre’ row resulted in a day-long trial at Doncaster Magistrates Court involving two barristers, eight witnesses and a district judge. Father-of-two Mr Looby, a construction worker who has since moved to Kuwait with his family, had his £1,000 travel costs paid from the public purse to fly in and give evidence. The total cost of the case is estimated at around £3,000 – with more than half that bill being paid by the taxpayer. Duke was found guilty of criminal damage by District Judge Jonathan Bennett. He rejected the policeman’s account that he was reclaiming his own wind chime, describing Duke’s actions as ‘extremely strange behaviour’ and a ‘foolish escapade.’ Duke was given a conditional discharge, ordered to pay £620 and £16.99 compensation to Mr Looby. After 26 years in the force Duke also faces losing his job following the criminal conviction. He then removed the garden ornament, which he threw on a fire, before claiming they belonged to him . The bitter feud between the neighbours was only settled by a day-long trial at a magistrates court . Questioning why the wind chime dispute came to court, District Judge Bennett said: ‘Sometimes I wondered today what we were all doing here at an overburdened court to deal with criminal damage out of a neighbour dispute over a £16.99 wind chime. The Crown felt the matter met the public interest and I had to judge it on its merits.’ The court heard Duke moved in to the house at Barnsley, South Yorkshire, in August 2012 with his partner Detective Constable Eleanor Bottomley and their two sons. The Loobys had lived next door for seven years but were dismayed when Duke started burning doors, cupboards, carpets and plastic in his back garden. They complained to the council and were advised to keep a log of all fires and were able to monitor activities via a CCTV camera that was previously installed for security reasons. In March this year they checked video footage – which was played in court – showing Duke dressed in jeans climbing the fence and removing the chimes from the paved garden. Mr Looby produced a receipt to prove he bought the ‘Chimes of Polaris’ from a local garden centre three years earlier. Duke (pictured, left) set fire to wind chimes belonging to neighbour Mr Looby (pictured) after the pair had a row about smoke from garden bonfires in March this year. The police officer now faces a disciplinary probe . He described the chimes in court and said: ‘You could hear it most times through the day when it was windy.’ He said Duke never had a wind chime. Duke told the court he put a wind chime in his garden when he moved there as it came from his partner’s late grandmother and was of ‘sentimental value.’ Mr Looby said he was very fond of the wind chimes . He was off work for three weeks with a knee problem and realised ‘the wind chime had gone.’ He saw a wind chime hanging in the Loobys garden. ‘I recognised it straight away as our old rusty metal wind chime.’ Duke told the court ‘in hindsight I might have dealt with it differently but at the time it seemed a reasonable thing to do.’ Adding: ‘I had reached a tipping point with everything else that had gone on. I was 1,000 per cent certain it was my wind chime.’ He believed Mr Looby had a ‘vendetta’ against him because he was a policeman. ‘I was very angry when I saw my wind chime on my neighbour’s wall.’ Miss Bottomley said they had decided to get rid of the wind chime because it had gone rusty. Guy Ladenburg, barrister for Duke, said in law no offence has been committed if the defendant holds an honest or mistaken belief that the property is his own. But the defence was rejected by the judge. After the case Mr Looby said: ‘I felt passionate about this. I hope people can see the bigger picture. It is the principle of the matter. ‘I would have paid my own fare to come over for this. We have a serving police sergeant who was prepared to climb over a fence and do something like that. It is an absolute waste of taxpayers’ money. But justice has been done.’ South Yorkshire Police are to carry out a misconduct investigation to decide Duke’s future. Detective Superintendent Terry Mann said the public rightly expected ‘high standards of behaviour’ from officers. ‘The force expects its staff to act with integrity and professionalism to ensure people receive a high quality service and have a police service they can be proud of.’ The neighbours were involved in a dispute after the Loobys complained to the council about bonfire smoke .","Police officer Paul Duke upset neighbour Edmund Looby with garden fires .

"A cash-strapped disabled Spanish woman is auctioning off her non-vital organs in a bid to keep financially afloat. The 44-year-old mother-of-one, who has not been named, said she was selling off one of her kidneys, corneas, a lung and a piece of her liver because she cannot afford her monthly rent and is facing eviction. She told El Mundo newspaper in an interview: 'All I want is a home, a job I can do, and enough money to support my daughter through her studies. An unnamed disabled Spanish woman is auctioning off her non-vital organs in a bid to keep financially afloat. She was interviewed on camera but kept her identity hidden . 'I just need to do what I can for my daughter - her life is what's most important. I don't care about my own any more. 'I started off trying to sell a kidney, but now I'm not just selling that, I'm also selling my corneas, one of my lungs and a piece of my liver. 'I will sell whatever piece of my body that someone wants to buy and I am selling it out of desperation.' The Valencia resident, who faces 12 years in jail for 'illegal organ trafficking' if caught, said she only received 426 Euros in dole money per month. The Spanish woman cannot afford rent despite being offered a low rate by Valencia City Hall, pictured . And because she is certified 66 per cent disabled due to a severe back problem, it means she is severely restricted in the type of jobs she can do. So, despite being offered a low rent by Valencia City Hall which would come to just 400 Euros per month, she can only really afford a fraction of that amount. She told the newspaper she had spoken to a woman doctor in Melilla, one of the two Spanish-owned cities on the north Moroccan coast, about selling her non-vital organs. It resulted in posting an advert online, but so far it has not produced a response. This is because, in reality, it is nearly impossible to sell organs, and is illegal in most countries. It has not been revealed on exactly which site the announcement has been placed. But the woman said her body parts are 'all she has' and 'the only thing she can raise money from'. The newspaper reported that her 22-year-old student daughter receives a small orphan's pension after her natural father died some years ago. They both live in a house owned by the woman's ex-boyfriend, from whom she separated after he regularly beat her up during their 15-year relationship. She reported him on several occasions, but when the case went to court, a judge found the woman's former partner not guilty. She said that, in the three years since they split up, things 'had gone from bad to worse' and that he was now trying to evict her as she could not pay the rent.

"The jihadists who posted pictures of themselves and one of their children wielding decapitated heads in the Middle East earlier this year reportedly went on a 'shooting party' with a prominent Sydney construction boss prior to leaving Australia. Four Corners reported Sydney business identity George Alex, who is currently under investigation by the Trade Union Royal Commission, took militants Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar to a rural property near Lithgow, in the Central West of New South Wales in November 2013. The trip to the Glen Davis property was organised as a 'pick me up' for Mr Alex, the documentary program reported Mr Alex's lawyer saying, as the construction industry identity was 'suffering depression' at the time. Scroll down for video . Father and son: Convicted Australian militant Khaled Sharrouf, left, and his unidentified seven-year-old son were pictured brandishing decapitated heads in Raqqa, Syria, in August . Barbaric: Western Sydney born militant Mohammed Elomar also appeared wielding decapitated heads in social media posts . The ABC's Four Corners program has revealed Sharrouf and Elomar attended a 'shooting party' with construction industry boss George Alex, pictured today, last November . George Alex attended Downing Centre Local Court today. He is facing charges of making threats to a number of people . Mr Alex's lawyer told the program there was 'little shooting' and that it was more of a 'big barbecue'. Police later found the property littered with used ammunition, Four Corners reported. The program also revealed police are examining Sharrouf's links to the July 2013 murder of standover man Vasko Boskovski. Boskovski was gunned down when he answered the door of his Earlwood home around 9:30pm AEDT on a Monday evening. Deputy Police Commissioner Nick Kaldas told Four Corners: 'It's difficult to comment on the Boskovski murder simply because it is very much a live investigation at the moment. 'But we are aware that there was a relationship between the two of them and it is very much a part of the murder investigation that's currently afoot.' The ABC report also shed light on how Elomar, Sharrouf and Mr Alex became acquainted. Karen Nettleton, the child's grandmother, fronted the Royal Commission in September and claimed Sharrouf had worked as a 'bodyguard' for Mr Alex. But Mr Alex denied this, saying through a lawyer that he knew the pair through boxing. Mohammed Elomar, particularly, had been touted as as future boxing star. The Western Sydney militants rose to infamy in August this year after posting gruesome decapitation images on social media. Vasko Boskovski, pictured, was gunned down at his front door in July 2013.

He was joined in Syria by his three children, pictured here wielding rifles, and his wife, Tara Nettleton . Mohammad Ali Baryalei, the most senior Australian Islamic State militant, was reported killed last week . Sharrouf uploaded an image to Twitter of his seven-year-old son wielding a decapitated head in Raqqa, Syria. The picture was condemned by some world leaders, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry labelling it 'disgusting' and 'grotesque'. 'This image, perhaps even an iconic photograph... is really one of the most disturbing, stomach-turning, grotesque photographs ever displayed,' Mr Kerry told reporters. Sharrouf fled to the Middle East on his brother's passport last December. He was soon joined by his three young children and his wife, Tara Nettleton. Ms Nettleton's truck driver father, Peter, has said he was 'totally gutted' by the picture of his grandson. The Federal government estimates as many as 250 Australians could be providing support, or fighting for, the Islamic State. The most senior Australian Islamic State militant, Mohammed Ali Baryalei, was reported killed last week. Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said the government had not confirmed the killing. She said the reported incident proved the dangers of fighting for the terror group. 'It does highlight what the government has been saying that Australians who leave this country to fight in Iraq and Syria are putting themselves in mortal danger,' she said.","Jihadists went on a 'shooting party' with construction industry identity George Alex, an ABC program has revealed .

"The trilby - a hat synonymous with celebrities Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake - is risky enough as a fashion statement. But now the headpiece has foiled an armed robbery, after a trilby-wearing gunman gave up on his heist when staff refused to take him seriously. The botched robbery began when the man entered a Seville, Spain, pharmacy shortly before closing time. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage shows the robber entering the chemist with his hands in his pockets and wearing a trilby . He approaches the counter before he pulls out the gun from his coat pocket . He then reveals the gun and waves it in the face of a pharmacist, who refuses to give him any money . As an assistant went to help a couple of customers with a baby, the man wearing glasses and a beard is seen approaching the counter. He then pulls out a gun and points it at pharmacist Amaru Barrios Ruiz, 27. Mr Ruiz said: 'He demanded money and I just told him simply he wasn't going to get anything. 'He looked completely dumbfounded and repeated the demand pointing the gun at me again. So I pushed it away and told him no.' As the botched robbery was being played out only a few feet away customers and other pharmacists carried on their business completely oblivious to the scene unfolding beside them. Customer Bianca Sierra Lozano, 34, said: 'I was vaguely aware of the man at the counter but wasn't the slightest bit interested in what he wanted.' After he is unable to frighten Mr Ruiz into handing over money, the frustrated crook walks over to the other pharmacist who also tells him to go away. After he is unable to get money from the first staff member, he next tries to threaten a second pharmacist, who simply tells him to go away .

"The judge who allowed the naming of a teenager who killed his teacher yesterday hit back at his critics and insisted that public shaming had a ‘clear deterrent effect.’ Mr Justice Coulson took a swipe at ‘ill-informed commentators’ as he explained why he agreed to a media application to allow 16-year-old Will Cornick to be identified. The judge dismissed defence claims Cornick should be protected under European human rights laws. Jailed: Classroom murderer Will Cornick, 16, left, was allowed to be named after he was sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in jail for the murder of his teacher Ann Maguire, 61, right, in front of her class . Cornick was told he must serve a minimum of 20 years for murdering teacher Ann Maguire, 61, in front of her class and warned him he might never be released because he is so dangerous. During a discussion on the BBC’s Newsnight programme on Tuesday critics argued that Cornick’s name should have been kept secret because he will be put at risk and it will hinder his rehabilitation. They said no useful purpose was served by naming the killer – and said the killers of James Bulger, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, also should not have been named. In his written judgement Mr Justice Coulson said he came down ‘firmly on the side of the public interest.’ 'Naming him has a clear deterrent effect': Mr Justice Coulson said identifying Cornick as the killer would also inform the public debate about the issues . He said: ‘In my view, naming him has a clear deterrent effect. Ill-informed commentators may scoff, but those of us involved in the criminal justice system know that deterrence will almost always be a factor in the naming of those involved in offences such as this.’ The judge added: ‘It has to be noted that this is an exceptional case. Public interest has been huge. There are wider issues at stake, such as the safety of teachers, the possibility of American-style security measures in schools, and the dangers of “internet loners” concocting violent fantasies on the internet. ‘I consider that the debate on those issues will be informed by the identification of William Cornick as the killer. ‘That is not least because he cannot be dismissed as the product of a hopeless background or a dysfunctional family. ‘On the contrary, for the reasons already given, he came from a loving and supportive family who have been devastated by what he did.’ David Glen, a barrister representing media organisations including the Daily Mail, had argued criminals who commit ‘serious and detestable’ offences should be publicly identified. Cornick’s barrister Richard Wright, QC, told Leeds Crown Court naming Cornick would be ‘wholly contrary’ to his welfare. Mr Wright said there was a real and immediate danger Cornick would either kill himself or be attacked by other inmates if his identity was known. He argued it would make any prospect of his rehabilitation ‘effectively impossible.’ Fears for the killer’s family was also given as a reason for secrecy, but the judge said Cornick’s supportive parents will continue to help their son ‘whether he is identified or not’ On Newsnight the decision was criticised by a convicted juvenile murderer. Ben Gunn, who served 32 years in prison for murdering a friend, said: ‘I don’t see how it’s of any use, it serves no useful purpose, to put his name and picture in the paper.’ Gunn was 14 when he pleaded guilty to clubbing an 11-year-old friend to death on a bus with the leg of a school desk. Author Blake Morrison, compared the case to that of James Bulger’s killers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, about whom he has written extensively. He said: ‘By naming the boy he will be exposed to dangers from other prisoners and of course his family, who are blameless in this, will also be in the public eye. ‘So I honestly don’t see what public interest is being served here by people knowing who this boy is.’ Frances Crook, of the Howard League for Penal Reform wrote in the Guardian: ‘Any judge who claims that it is in the public interest to identify a 16-year-old boy convicted of murder – as happened today to the killer of schoolteacher Ann Maguire – risks giving in to the voracious media and to public voyeurism.’","Mr Justice Coulson takes a swipe at ‘ill-informed commentators’

"A single mom in Pennsylvania has been sentenced to prison for helping to end her teen daughter's pregnancy by giving her pills purchased online. Jennifer Ann Whalen, 39, of Washingtonville, who works as a nursing home aide, was sentenced on Friday to nine to 18 months behind bars after pleading guilty to performing an illegal abortion. Whalen bought the miscarriage-inducing pills from a European drug firm after the 16-year-old girl had gotten pregnant, but did not want to have the child. A single mom in Pennsylvania has been sentenced to prison for helping to end her teen daughter's pregnancy by giving her pills purchased online (stock image) She was sentenced on Friday by Montour County Court of Common Pleas Judge Gary Norton to serve 12 months to 18 months in prison for violating a state law that requires abortions to be performed by physicians. She was also fined $1,000 and ordered to perform 40 hours of community service after her release. The felony offense called for up to seven years in prison and a $15,000 fine. Whalen told authorities they couldn't find a local clinic to perform an abortion, and the girl had no insurance to pay for a hospital stay. The closest abortion clinic to Whalen's home is about 74 miles away in Harrisburg. The girl took the pills and wound up hospitalized with extreme abdominal pain and bleeding, reports The Press Enterprise.

In June, Florida toughened state law to allow for prosecutions in the death of non-viable fetuses.","Jennifer Ann Whalen, 39, of Washingtonville, Pennsylvania was sentenced on Friday after pleading guilty to performing an illegal abortion .

"For many New Yorkers, the subway is an easy - often, stressful - means to get across the city. But for one couple, it was a place of joy on Friday as they exchanged their wedding vows on it. In a moving ceremony, Hector Irakliotis, 26, and Tatyana Sandler, 25, got married in front of dozens of stunned commuters on the N train as it crossed the Manhattan Bridge from Brooklyn. Newlyweds: Hector Irakliotis (right), 26, and Tatyana Sandler (left), 25, got married in front of dozens of surprised commuters on the N subway train as it crossed the Manhattan Bridge from Brooklyn on Friday . They had  chosen to wed on the subway line because they had spent a large amount of time traveling on it during their courtship, according to the New York Daily News. 'We’ve been through a lot. Good times, bad times, and a lot of the good times have taken place on the train,' Mr Irakliotis told the newspaper. 'Confessions of love, reconciliations, goofy, ridiculous conversations - the whole spectrum. In New York, you spend so much time on the train, we thought why not?' On the day, Mr Irakliotis, a game designer,  boarded the line at Kings Highway at around 3.30pm with his groomsmen, who then decorated the car's poles and seats with white ribbons. Unorthodox: The couple, who exited the N train at Canal Street and headed to a bar for  drinks, had chosen to wed on the subway line because they had spent a large amount of time traveling on it during their courtship . Donning a black suit and bow tie, the groom-to-be told commuters: 'Everyone, hi. I have an announcement to make. I am going to be getting married in 20 minutes.' As wedding guests flocked into the car, he then invited others to stay to watch the ceremony, but asked if they would kindly move to the back, which they willingly did. Ten stops later, a beaming Miss Sandler, a Ukranian film editor, boarded the line at 36th Street, before walking down the aisle to 'City Love' by John Mayer, played on the best man's iPhone. The bride-to-be, who was donning a beautiful white gown and was accompanied by her maid of honor, then exchanged vows with Mr Irakliotis as the train traveled over the Manhattan Bridge. Speaking of the ceremony, performed by an interfaith chaplain, Miss Sandler said her partner had deliberately planned it so they would see the skyline as they were wed. 'I’m originally from Ukraine, and each time we’d come back here, I’d say to Hector, ""It doesn't feel like home until I see the skyline as we're crossing the bridge"". And he remembered that,' she said. Arrangements: On the day, Mr Irakliotis boarded the subway at Kings Highway in Brooklyn. Miss Sandler then got on at 36th Street.

State police Commissioner Frank Noonan updates the media on Saturday about the latest information on the manhunt for the person or persons who ambushed two troopers on Friday night . A member of the Pennsylvania State Trooper's Tactical Response Unit, walks along Route 402 on Saturday, part of a small army of hundreds of police searching for the killers . Crime Stoppers said it is offering $25,000 to anyone who can provide information leading to the arrest or conviction of those behind the shooting. 'We're looking for the cooperation of the public, if it's money that would motivate you or just outrage,' Noonan said. 'We have a dangerous, armed criminal that is still not in custody.' Dickson, who graduated from the police academy in 2007 and is a former Marine, is survived by his wife Tiffany and two young sons, a kindergartner and a second-grader. 'He was very proud of his family, and spoke often about them,' Philip Barletto, a colleague of Dickson's, posted on his Facebook page. 'I am deeply saddened by his loss.' Dickson, who graduated from the police academy in 2007, with his wife Tiffany and their two young sons, both of whom are in elementary school . The U.S. flag is flow at half-staff outside of the Pennsylvania State Police headquarters in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, where Dickson lived . 'He was very, very work oriented,' Melissa Contorno, who became friends with Tiffany Dickson about 12 years ago as a fellow nurse at Regional Hospital, told The Times-Tribune. 'He was all about it. He was a stand-up guy. He wanted to provide for his family. It's just awful. She spends her life taking care of people, and she's really good at what she does. Now people have to help her.' Earlier in the day, police said they were questioning . a man about the shooting. The so-called person of interest was later identified as Jeffrey Hudak, 48, Trooper Connie Devens said, according to the AP. Devens emphasized that Hudak was not under arrest or in custody. During his news conference, Noonan stressed that police will be questioning 'hundreds of people' in their investigation, and there is currently no specific person that is a suspect. 'I don't want anyone to be unfairly tarnished,' he said. The shooting occurred at the Blooming Grove barracks around 11pm on Friday, Noonan said earlier. The incident promped a manhunt by police from . Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey. Blooming Grove is a township of roughly 5,000 people near the New York state border.The barracks is in a wooded area, surrounded by state game lands, and runs along the Delaware River. SWAT teams were in full force as police hunted for the shooter or shooters behind the ambush, which left a trooper dead and another injured . The Pennsylvania State Police are questioning Jeffrey Hudak about the shooting but emphasized that he is not under arrest or in custody . 'I know a lot of people are wondering if the threat is . resolved. It is not,' Noonan said at a morning news conference. 'The individual who perpetrated . this heinous crime is still at large.' Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett released a statement expressing sympathy for the family, friends and colleagues for the trooper who was killed and urging citizens to remain patient and vigilant. 'Every attack on an officer of the law is an attack on our state, our country and civilized society,' he said in the statement. 'The incident in Blooming Grove shows, once again, that our first responders face constant danger in order that the rest of us may live in peace and safety.' Noonan said police do not have a description or any . information on the identity of the shooter or shooters. Noonan said the troopers were ambushed but would not share . details of the incident because it was still under . investigation. 'This has been an emotional night for all of us,' Noonan said. Douglass, the wounded trooper, underwent surgery and was in a stable . condition, according to Noonan. Police did not believe the general public was at risk but asked that everyone remain on the lookout for anything suspicious. 'People in the area can come and go freely but should be alert,' Noonan said. This is the third killing of a state trooper in the area over the last 35, according to the Pocono Record. Pennsylvania State Trooper Joshua Miller was shot in, 2009 by a father who had kidnapped his nine-year-old son, the paper reported. After taking the boy from his home in Nazareth, the father led police on a chase before he was cornered. An in 1981, an 11-year veteran of the New Jersey State Police was killed by members of a radical environmental group known as the United Freedom Front during a traffic stop.","Authorities say whoever was behind the attack remains at large as hundreds of police from Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York engage in a massive manhunt .

"Proud of her job: Rebekah Brooks leaving the Phone Hacking trial at the Old Bailey in London . Rebekah Brooks spent £159,000 to buy the story of a prostitute caught performing a sex act on Hugh Grant, the phone-hacking trial heard yesterday. Divine Brown was paid $100,000 (£64,000) directly by the News of the World for her sordid story and the tabloid lavished another £95,000 flying her and her entire family by private jet to a luxury resort in the Nevada desert. Brooks, then the features editor, said this was to prevent rival newspapers spoiling their exclusive story about Grant. But she denied there was a ‘dark arts department’ for phone hacking at the News of the World, which she later edited. Brooks, 45, told the Old Bailey she knew nothing of the illegal interception of voicemails by the tabloid’s private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and had never heard his name mentioned when she was editor. It was her first chance to defend herself after four months of prosecution claims that she was central in a conspiracy at the News of the World and The Sun to hack phones and to corrupt public officials. While recounting her rapid rise through the ‘old school misogyny’ of the newspaper world, Brooks told how as the News of the World’s features editor, her speciality was buying up celebrities for exclusive stories. When Four Weddings And A Funeral star Grant was arrested with Miss Brown in a car on Hollywood’s Sunset Boulevard in June 1995, the paper’s US editor and a colleague managed to track down the prostitute after she was released from custody. Brooks said she spent her entire weekly budget of £60,000 chartering a plane for Miss Brown – real name Estella Marie Thompson – and her family. ‘Miss Brown had been traced to her family home by one of the paper’s reporters, a former private investigator, after her arrest with Mr Grant in Los Angeles. Divine Brown: Flown into hiding . Hugh Grant: Arrested in LA in 1995 . ‘We flew them to a place in Nevada – the desert’, she added, breaking into laughter. ‘It seems silly now, but it was really important. ‘She was very smart. She wanted all her family relocated so we had to hire a plane because there were so many of them... it ended up costing around $200,000... $250,000. It was probably one of the biggest expenses I had done, which is why I have a relatively clear memory of it.’ She later had to explain the ‘huge cost’ to the paper’s editor and managing editor. Brooks moved to The Sun in January 1998 and said she brought her contacts with her. One was Spurs footballer Paul Gascoigne, whom she paid £50,000 to £80,000 for an exclusive interview about his domestic violence towards his former wife Sheryl. She also ‘dealt a lot’ with PR guru Max Clifford, who ‘brokered stories’ to her. Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie Brooks leave the court . Brooks – one of the most influential women in Britain until her arrest over the hacking allegations – had smiled as she entered the witness box, moments after hearing one of the charges against her had been dropped. Dressed in a demure cream cardigan with pearl buttons and a knee-length royal blue shift dress, and with her red curls pinned back off her face, she spoke softly and hesitantly of how her career began sweeping newsroom floors and making tea but took her into the corridors of power by the age of 29. It included meetings with Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson before they entered Government and careers advice from Rupert Murdoch. The media tycoon entered her office when she was appointed deputy editor at the News of the World and told her: ‘You’ve got a long career ahead, take your time and learn on the job.’ He told her to avoid publicity and that he did not want her ‘spouting forth opinions’ on current affairs programmes. She said: ‘He gave good advice – you are a newspaper executive, it’s hard work, keep your head down.’ Initially faltering and hesitant, Brooks had been warned she was likely to spend a long time in the witness box. She appeared to grow in composure as she was challenged directly about the phone-hacking allegations. The jury has heard that Mulcaire has admitted targeting dozens of celebrities on the orders of former News of the World journalists Greg Miskiw and Neville Thurlbeck. The three have admitted conspiring to hack phones. Jonathan Laidlaw QC, for Brooks, asked her if she had ever heard any of her journalists talk about Mulcaire while she was editor, between May 2000 and January 2003. ‘No,’ she answered immediately. She said she had known the tabloid used private detectives – as did  other newspapers, City firms and lawyers – but insisted she had never heard Mulcaire’s name mentioned, nor had any knowledge of his involvement in phone hacking. Mr Laidlaw said the prosecution had alleged she had established an investigations unit dubbed the ‘dark arts department’ specifically to hack phones. ‘That’s not true,’ Brooks replied, adding: ‘I don’t recognise that description.’ Brooks said she was proud of the undercover work carried out by the News of the World, which had been in the public interest. She told the jury it was ‘impossible’ for an editor to know the source for every article in their newspaper. She described the ‘incredibly competitive’ atmosphere inside the tabloid – once Britain’s best-selling newspaper – and said her rapid promotion had exposed her to sexist jibes. ‘There was probably a bit of old school misogyny added into the competition there would have been if I was a bloke,’ she said. ‘The competitiveness was engrained into the News of the World... It was a tough world.’ Brooks denies four charges of conspiring to hack phones, commit misconduct and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Her husband, racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, and her former lover, ex-News of the World Andy Coulson, watched from the dock as she gave her evidence. They also deny all the charges against them.

"Great expectations: Bake Off is making Lorraine's children expect perfect cakes at home (posed by models) My son, aged six, is furious with me. The gingerbread men are a 'flippin’ disaster', he says, hand on hip, accusingly. It's raining, it’s Sunday, what are we doing? We're cooking, of course. He's right. They're one-legged, burnt at the edges and as inedible as polystyrene. Mabel, aged two‑and-a-half, regards them suspiciously. 'Idiots,' she says. It's her new word, which is oddly appropriate on this occasion but was wholly inappropriate in the queue at Morrisons earlier (I don't know where she picked that one up). Frankly, the boy doesn’t understand the pressure I'm under or he wouldn’t be so harsh. I blame the bloody Great British Bake Off - it's making parenting even harder. This is a generation of children who know what the word 'consistency' means. My son expects me to throw a few bits in a bowl and pull a star-baker souffle out of the oven. The gingerbread men - who look like escapees from the broken biscuit factory - are a let-down, but worse still, they make him question all my parenting skills. I can see him thinking: 'Why should I go to bed on time for a woman who can't make biscuits?' Once upon a time, you just made jam tarts (with pre-prepared pastry) with your kids. But because every other TV show is a cook‑off, now they expect Mum (and Dad) to have culinary super-powers. I think my son would be more impressed if I managed to cook a firm meringue than if I beat Mo Farah in the 5,000 metres (the latter is more likely). TGBBO is doubling my maternal stress - I am not equipped to deliver the expectation it has created - and unless The Great British Hand Print Painting Off becomes a hit TV series some time soon, I will continue to fail in the eyes of my 'kid critics', as they have dubbed themselves. Queen of cakes: Mary Berry . At meal times the four of them have started to 'mark' their tea out loud, like mini-Masterchef judges: my roast potatoes got nine out of ten on Sunday, but the homemade gravy got a grim two (what can I say - we'd run out of Bisto). The eldest even wants to start a cooking blog. If she does that, people will start to question if we really are related given my lack of expertise. She's been inspired by a girl who started critiquing her Scottish school dinners at the age of nine. Martha Payne's blog became an internet sensation and she won Human Rights Young person of the year in the 2012 Liberty Awards. Our 11-year-old wants a piece of that pie, but apart from setting up the blog - which I can do - there's nothing more I can contribute (I am the woman who once grilled a frozen chicken leg). And cooking brings out the worst in me. I'm impatient, hot-tempered and illogical. It was only when I had the third child that I realised I didn't have to do all the things I hated just because they wanted to do it. I won't play Monopoly (it's boring) or computer games (they can do that with Dad). But I love sticking, gluing, glitter and drawing. I love a swimming pool or an indoor play centre. Swings and roundabouts, as they say. However, on Sunday I broke my 'can't cook, won’t cook' rule for the gingerbread men - we'd run out of films to watch and games to play and, annoyingly, we had all the necessary ingredients. We followed the instructions, and apart from the chilled ball of dough dropping on the floor and being nosed around by the dog for a few seconds, I have no idea why they turned out to be mutants. 'We would never win anything with those,' the children chorused. 'Idiots,' Mabel concluded. Lorraine Candy is editor‑in-chief of ELLE.","TV baking guru is making parenting harder .

"He was the first Pakistani to win a Nobel prize in physics after he predicted the existence of the so-called 'God particle', but in his home country Abdus Salam's achievements have been written from the record books. Despite being a leading figure in Pakistan's space and nuclear program Salam was shunned by Muslim fundamentalists when they took control of the country in the 1970s. Although he was a Muslim, the physicist, who died in 1996, belonged to the Ahmadi sect, who believed Hadrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was their spiritual leader as opposed to the prophet Muhammad. Ignored: Abdus Salam was the first Pakistani to win a Nobel prize in . physics after he predicted the existence of the so-called God particle, . but in his home country his achievements have been written from the . record books . As a result Salam along with Pakistanis from other religious minorities, such as Shiite Muslims, Christians and Hindus were pushed into the wilderness and attacked by militants from the Sunni Muslim majority. Today all Pakistani passport applicants must declare on their passport application that they believe the prophet Hadrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmed was an 'impostor' and that his followers are 'non-Muslims.' Today Ahmadis face prison or even death if they pose as Muslims, practise their faith publicy, describe their places of worship as mosques or take part in the sacred Muslim call to prayer. Breakthrough: The groundbreaking work by professor Salam, left, on subatomic particles was proved by the discovery of the Higgs-boson particle at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, pictured right . Salam received a string of international prizes and honours for his groundbreaking work in the world of subatomic physics. In 1979, he was joint winner of the Nobel Prize for his research on the Standard Model of particle physics, which theorized that fundamental forces govern the overall dynamics of the universe. Salam and Steven Weinberg, with whom he shared the prize, independently anticipated the existence the 'God particle' which later became formally known as the Higgs boson after the British professor Peter Higgs who said the particle was responsible for endowing other particles with mass. Pervez Hoodbhoy, a Pakistani physicist who once worked with Salam, said the way his colleague had been treated was a tragedy. He added: 'He went from someone who was revered in Pakistan, a national celebrity, to someone who could not set foot in Pakistan. If he came, he would be insulted and could be hurt or even killed.' Physicists in Switzerland stoked worldwide excitement on Wednesday when they announced they have all but proven the Higgs boson particle's existence. This was done using the world's largest atom smasher at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, near Geneva. 'This would be a great vindication of Salam's work and the Standard Model as a whole,' said Khurshid Hasanain, chairman of the physics department at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad. Discover: A computer generated image of a collision between two protons. The discovery of the so-called 'God particle' proved Salam's theory correct . Atomic level: Salam received a string of international prizes and honours for his groundbreaking work in the world of subatomic physics - pictured a 'typical candidate' event measured in the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland . In the 1960s and early 1970s, Salam wielded significant influence in Pakistan as the chief scientific adviser to the president, helping to set up the country's space agency and institute for nuclear science and technology. Salam also assisted in the early stages of Pakistan's effort to build a nuclear bomb, which it eventually tested in 1998. Salam's life, along with the fate of the 3 million other Ahmadis in Pakistan, drastically changed in 1974 when parliament amended the constitution to declare that members of the sect were not considered Muslims under Pakistani law. Salam resigned from his government post in protest and eventually moved to Europe to pursue his work. In Italy, he created a centre for theoretical physics to help physicists from the developing world. Although Pakistan's then-president, General Zia ul-Haq, presented Salam with Pakistan's highest civilian honour after he won the Nobel Prize, the general response in the country was muted. The physicist was celebrated more enthusiastically by other nations, including Pakistan's archenemy, India. Despite his achievements, Salam's name appears in few textbooks and is rarely mentioned by Pakistani leaders or the media. Professor Higgs, 83, wiped a tear from his eye as the findings were . announced, and later said: 'It's really an incredible thing that it's . happened in my lifetime.' Acknowledged: Salam and Steven Weinberg, with whom he shared the prize, independently anticipated the existence the 'God particle'. The Super Proton Synchrotron tunnel at the Large Hadron Collider is pictured . Find: Physicists in Switzerland stoked worldwide excitement when they announced they have all but proven the Higgs boson particle's existence using the world's largest atom smasher . By contrast, fellow Pakistani physicist A.Q. Khan, who played a key role in developing the country's nuclear bomb and later confessed to spreading nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya, is considered a national hero. Khan is a Muslim. The president who honored Salam would later go on to intensify persecution of Ahmadis, for whom life in Pakistan has grown even more precarious. Taliban militants attacked two mosques packed with Ahmadis in Lahore in 2010, killing at least 80 people. 'Many Ahmadis have received letters from fundamentalists since the 2010 attacks threatening to target them again, and the government isn't doing anything,' said Qamar Suleiman, a spokesman for the Ahmadi community. For Salam, not even death saved him from being targeted. Hoodbhoy said his body was returned to Pakistan in 1996 after he died in Oxford, England, and was buried under a gravestone that read 'First Muslim Nobel Laureate.' A local magistrate ordered that the word 'Muslim' be erased.","Abdus Salam predicted the existence of the Higgs-boson particle in 1970s .

In a televised address, the 76-year-old, who has ruled since 1975,  said he wanted to herald in a ‘new era of hope’ and ensure a ‘younger generation… with new energies’ could take over the helm.

Messi has made a habit of breaking records recently and he has achieved this feat at just 27 years old. In November, Messi became the outright top scorer in the history of the Champions League, also leapfrogging Raul, after he scored a fine hat-trick against APOEL Nicosia. That took him to 74 for the tournament and he finished this season's group stage with another goal against Paris Saint-Germain. Lionel Messi is awarded a trophy by La Liga for setting a new scoring record . Messi, Luis Suarez (left) and Neymar (centre) all scored in the win against Atletico Madrid . The Barcelona star also reached 100 La Liga assists in the Atletico win and became the second player to achieve this feat in the last 25 years, after Luis Figo. Messi, who is in Zurich but is expected to lose out to Cristiano Ronaldo for the Ballon d'Or award, celebrated the win that moved Barcelona to within one point of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga, by committing his future to the club. The Argentine hit out at 'lies' linking him with a move to the Premier League. Messi started following Chelsea on Instagram last Monday - the day he failed to turn up for training complaining of a stomach bug. Stories have circulated in the Spanish press in recent weeks of Barcelona being in crisis with claims that many players, including Messi, were unhappy with Luis Enrique's tactics and coaching methods. He said: 'I've heard stories I've spoken to Chelsea or City, that's all lies. 'I've heard so many things. There have been things said in the past that I have bad relationships with (Pep) Guardiola, (Samuel) Eto'o, Bojan (Krkic), Ibra (Zlatan Ibrahimovic), that's not true. 'I never asked for them to get rid of the coach or anybody. That's not true, I would never do that.' Raul and Messi both scored an impressive number of goals for Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively . On March 16, against Osasuna, he passed Paulino Alcantara to become Barcelona's all-time top goalscorer (371) A week later he overtook Alfredo Di Stefano as the outright El Clasico top goalscorer (21) with a hat-trick in a 4-3 win against Real Madrid . He scored his 400th career goal in a 6-0 win against Granada on September 27 . He passed Telmo Zarra's 59-year-old record to become La Liga's all-time top goalscorer (253) on November 22 . Three days later he overtook Raul by scoring a hat-trick to become the outright top goalscorer in the history of the Champions League (74) - he now has 75 .","Barcelona beat Atletico Madrid 3-1 at the Nou Camp .

"The Islamic State has threatened a fresh wave of violence against the Yazidi religious minority in Iraq, saying they will execute 300 families whom they have surrounded in northern Iraq. It came after the jihadist militant group took hostage hundreds of Yazidi women in their stronghold city of Mosul yesterday, amid warnings that they had 'vicious plans' for their captives. Fighters for the Islamic State (IS), formerly known as ISIS, continue to lay siege to a mountain near the Turkish border, where as many as 50,000 of the minority - considered apostates and devil-worshippers by IS - have been holed up without food or water. They today received aid from Kurdish and American forces, who have intervened to protect the embattled minority group after an international outcry. Scroll down for video . Desperate masses: Stranded Yazidi men, women and children rush towards a Kurdish helicopter carrying aid today, as IS fighters surround mount Sinjar . Tearful: Some children were carried off to safety, but thousands of the religious minority remains stranded on the mountainside . Under fire: The film crew, embedded with the Kurdish fighters, also saw a firefight between the helicopter gunner and IS forces with anti-aircraft weapons . Persecuted: Yazidi children (pictured) have taken to sheltering in the holy valley of Lalish, while others trapped in the Sinjar Mountains were flown renewed supplies by the U.S. today. The religious minority is not alone in being threatened by the militants, who also say Christians and Shia Muslims are heretics and should convert . Plight: Left, a Yazidi woman and a young baby shelter in Lalish, the religion's holy valley in northern Iraq. Right: A Yazidi girl who has escaped to the city of Sirnak, Turkey . Masses of desperate, crying Yazidis were filmed today by a crew from Rudaw news perched in a Kurdish helicopter as water and supplies were dropped, while the chopper came under fire from IS troops below. American plans also dropped supplies, and RAF helicopters were today dispatched to do the same. The latest threat to the three hundred families - who live in the villages of Koja, Hatimiya and Qaboshi - came after the Sunni militant group surrounded them, according to a Yazidi politician. It came as U.S. President Barack Obama said more air strikes were likely around the Sinjar Mountains where the Yazidis are trapped - and refused to give a timetable for how long the offensive might take. The U.S. and Iraqi governments have stepped up our military assistance to Kurds as they wage this fight,' he said. 'American aircraft are positioned to strike IS terrorists around the mountain to help forces in Iraq break the seige and rescue those who are trapped there.' He insisted he was pursuing a 'broader strategy' aimed at 'preventing an act of genocide'. 'Ultimately only Iraqis can ensure the stability and security of Iraq', he said. 'The United States can't do it for them.' But he added: 'We will protect our American citizens in Iraq whether they're diplomats, civilians or military. If these terrorists threaten our facilities or our personnel we will take action to protect our people. Threat: Islamic State fighters have continued their relentless sweep through Iraq, causing refugees to flee and carrying out brutal executions on their enemies . 'Long-term project': President Barack Obama said today that American involvement, which began yesterday with targeted air strikes, could prove protracted . How events unfolded: Yesterday marked a landmark campaign by the U.S., its first incursion into Iraq by air since troops pulled out of the country in 2011 . 'We will continue to provide military assistance and advice to the Iraqi government as they battle these terrorists so they cannot establish a safe haven. 'This morning I spoke with Prime Minister Cameron of the UK and President Hollande of France and I'm pleased that both leaders agree with our strong support. Once again America is proud to act alongside our closest friends and allies.' The haul on the C130 Hercules aircraft includes clean water, tents and tarpaulins for up to 75,000 people. A second plane left this afternoon - but the Ministry of Defence has been keen to stress there are no desires to enter another war. A spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We're talking about a humanitarian mission, not a military one'. And Britain has Special Forces in the region working with US counterparts, identifying potential targets for further air strikes aimed at stopping the advances of Islamists towards Kurdish areas or Baghdad. Many SAS men speak Arabic and know Iraq's mountains and cities well after a decade of missions. An MoD spokesman said: 'We do not comment on the movements of Special Forces'. Strikes: This images show the moment American fighter jets dropped their 500lbs payload on Islamic State outside Irbil yesterday . Smoke rising: There were two strikes launched less than two hours apart yesterday, which targeted mortar emplacements and a convoy . Yesterday extremists captured hundreds of Yazidi women in Mosul and held them in schools while thousands of other civilians fled in fear, according to officials. Kami Amin, a spokesman for Iraq's human rights ministry, said: 'We think that the terrorists by now consider them slaves and they have vicious plans for them. 'We think that these women are going to be used in demeaning ways by those terrorists to satisfy their animalistic urges in a way that contradicts all the human and Islamic values.' Escorted by two Navy fighter jets this morning, three planes dropped 72 bundles of supplies for the refugees trapped in the Sinjar Mountains in northern Iraq, where they are trying to escape to Turkey. The extremists' 'campaign of terror against the innocent, including the Yazidi and Christian minorities, and its grotesque and targeted acts of violence bear all the warning signs and hallmarks of genocide,' said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. 'For anyone who needed a wake-up call, this is it.' To the rescue: An RAF C130 Hercules is pictured above taking off from Camp Bastion in Iraq, laden with aid for the stranded Yazidi refugees . London calling: Britain also joined in the aid efforts in Iraq - pictured above is an RAF Hercules being loaded with drinking water and tents for the beleagured Yazidis . Locked in: An aid worker piles the packages into the Hercules - they are due to be dropped from the skies above Iraq, where as many as 50,000 are stranded . The U.S. bombing yesterday was followed up by a second round of airstrikes near Irbil, the city where officials said the artillery would have been used. According to the U.N., more than 500,000 people have been displaced by the violence in Iraq since June, bringing the total this year to well over a million. Expanding from their stronghold of Mosul, Islamic State have captured a string of towns and Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam and reservoir in recent weeks. The group captured Mosul in June then launched a blitz towards the south, sweeping over Sunni-majority towns almost to the capital, Baghdad. It already holds large parts of western Iraq and neighboring Syria, and Iraqi government forces crumbled in the face of the assault but have since been able to prevent the militants from advancing into Shiite-majority areas. In the north, Kurdish fighters have been the main line of defense against the radicals but they are over-stretched and under-resourced. In contrast to Washington's decision to invade Iraq more than a decade ago, both the airdrop and the authorization of military action against the Islamic State group were widely welcomed by Iraqi and Kurdish officials fearful of the militants' advance. 'We thank Barack Obama,' said Khalid Jamal Alber, from the Religious Affairs Ministry in the Kurdish government. The International Rescue Committee said it was providing emergency medical care for up to 4,000 dehydrated Yazidis, mostly women and children, who survived without food or water for up to six days hiding in the Sinjar mountains before fleeing to a refugee camp in Syria, where a civil war is raging. Officials in Britain, Germany and elsewhere pledged financial aid to support humanitarian efforts in Iraq, and several top European officials supported Obama's decision to intervene with airstrikes.

"An unemployed graduate claims she was stripped of her unemployment benefits because she attended a job interview. Ceri Padley had been receiving Jobseekers' Allowance since returning from 18 months travelling around the world. As part of the process, the 26-year-old was required to attend her local Job Centre to receive advice on how to find work and to qualify for the £71.70-a-week payment. And when the qualified teacher heard she had a second-stage interview for a job at a school which clashed with one of the twice monthly appointment, she assumed she could count of the full support of Job Centre staff. But she claims that despite attending a rescheduled meeting to sign-on the following day, she was stripped of her benefits. An official letter, posted on her blog, says that the decision to dock a month's worth of payments - a total of £286.80 - was because attending a job interview was not a 'sufficiently' good enough reason for not attending her long-standing appointment. Ceri, from Port Talbot, South Wales, . said: 'Going to a job interview is not good enough reason to miss a signing-on appointment. The clash occurred when the teaching . interview fell on June 5 - at exactly the time she was meant to see the . Job Centre adviser. But having agreed that she could come in the . following day, she was told she had breach the rules and would forfeit . her benefits. She added: 'I could completely understand their reasons if I hadn’t told them I had . an interview and just missed signing-on without warning anyone. 'I can also understand their reasons for looking at the time my job . interview finished (1.00pm) and thinking, “Hmmm, she can probably make . it back from Cardiff and sign on on time at 2.30pm”. 'But they told me NOT to come in on my regular signing-on day and to go in the following day for my new scheduled appointment. Out of work: The qualified teacher, 26, claims staff said her attending a job interview was not a 'sufficiently' good enough reason for missing a meeting at the Job Centre. (File picture) 'Not only that, but I’ve been sanctioned and left without money for a month. A whole month. 'Never mind the fact that I have job interviews coming up and no way of . getting to them now. Never mind the fact that my phone is due to go out . of service from lack of payment and every employer who has my CV has no . way of contacting me.' She added: 'I must be punished. I have been too productive with my time in . trying to get employed and, as a result, I must learn what life without . money is really like. Ceri, . who has eight years experience in customer services, call centres and . retail, is so desperate to get back into work she is applying for . everything she can.' She is considering leaving the country in order to find work but needs to save the money for a plane ticket.

"A coroner attacked the cosmetics industry yesterday for ‘grossly underestimating’ problems caused by a hair dye chemical. Geoff Fell called for action after an inquest heard how Julie McCabe, 39, collapsed and died from an extreme allergic reaction to the L’Oreal colour she used every month. It was only the third known death in the world and the second in the UK caused by the chemical para-phenylenediamine (PPD). But Mr Fell told the hearing that inadequate reporting meant the industry was hopelessly unaware of the scale of non-fatal allergic reactions. After the hearing, Mrs McCabe’s widower Russell said the tragedy may have been prevented if labels had clearer warnings of severe reactions. Her family is now hoping to sue L’Oreal. Julie McCabe, 39, died after suffering an extreme reaction to L'Oreal hair dye, inquest hears . The coroner also warned parents not to let children have popular black henna tattoos on holiday due to their dangerously high concentrations of PPD. The skin decorations by ‘artisan tattooists on the beach’ were ‘extremely dangerous’, he said. ‘These people need to be avoided like the plague - in fact, they are the plague,’ warned Mr Fell. Estate agent Mrs McCabe, 38, went into a coma in October 2011 after she suffered a massive allergic reaction to a chemical in her L'Oreal dye. She had a heart attack and died a year later. The inquest into her death heard that she had a black henna tattoo in Dubai in 2007 and her regular reactions to hair dye had increased after this. Expert evidence said the tattoos contained massive amounts of PPD - the chemical in the hair dye which is thought to have caused her reaction - and that the tattoos increased susceptibility. Returning an accidental death verdict, Mr Fell said he would be writing to the Department of Business Innovation and Skills to ask it to look into increasing public awareness of this danger. He said: 'People think it's a good idea to let their children have a black henna tattoo. 'That child could go through life 10, 15, 30 years and the first time that child dyes its hair there could be an anaphylactic reaction.' The mother-of-two suffered a severe reaction to L'Oreal Recital Preference hair dye in Shade One, also known as Naples Black (file picture), left, after having a black henna tattoo (stock picture), right, in Dubai which triggered regular reactions to the hair dye . Colouring products contain a variety of chemicals but PPD is the prime cause of allergic reaction to hair dye. It is needed for most shades of permanent colour, especially dark shades. There is a strict limit on the concentration of PPD at a maximum of 2 per cent in any substance applied to the hair. The dye used by Julie McCabe had a 1 per cent strength. There must also be clear warnings and usage instructions on all packaging. PPD is often used illegally in black henna tattoos offered at tourist spots. The inquest heard Mrs McCabe had a reaction from such a tattoo on holiday in Dubai in 2007. Mr Fell also called on the cosmetics industry to do more to find out how many customers have adverse reactions to their hair dyes, saying it had 'grossly under-estimated' the scale of the issue. PPDs are know to cause allergic reactions in a small number of cases but the industry had not found a replacement, the inquest in Skipton, North Yorkshire, heard. The coroner said there was a massive gap between industry figures, which suggest four customers in a million suffered such a reaction, and academic research which suggests it was as many as 14 per cent. Mr Fell said L'Oreal did not encourage customers to report such problems to it and urged the company to reconsider this position, and the industry as a whole to proactively commission more research. Mrs McCabe's family blames paraphenylenediamine (PPD) - a chemical found in hair dyes - for her extreme reaction. Pictured: Her parents Keith and Brenda Miller of Shipley, West Yorkshire . The coroner decided that Mrs McCabe, of Cowling, near Keighley, was aware of her allergy to the hair dye as she had gone to her GP at least 16 times to get treatment for much less severe reactions. But he said he was aware of only one other death in the UK due to an anaphylactic reaction to hair dye. North Yorkshire Coroner Geoff Fell warned that the cosmetics industry has 'no idea' of the extent to which customers are allergic to hair dye after the tragic death of Jule McCabe. Mr Fell said the number of people allergic to hair colourant had been 'grossly underestimated' and there was a 'massive disconnect' between allergy figures quoted by cosmetics firms and those found in academic research. One  study revealed 140,000 people suffered a reaction to hair dye for every million with half of those reporting problems continuing to use the dye. The industry said it was four in a million. 'Nobody has any idea how many customers are adversely affected by hair dye,' he warned. 'The industry is aware of the risk of anaphylaxis but the industry, it seems to me, has no idea of the incidents of non-fatal anaphylaxis due to hair dye.' The coroner now urged the industry to do more to encourage customers to report adverse reactions and to research the problem. 'L'Oreal do not actively seek feedback,' he added. 'I think L'Oreal need to revisit that approach.' Mr Fell said he would also be writing to the Department of Business Innovation and Skills to ask for more public awareness about black henna tattoos- which contain massive amounts of paraphenylenediamine- thought to increase susceptibility to reactions to hair dye. The three-day inquest heard how Mrs McCabe was a regular user of the L'Oreal Recital Preference product and between 2005 and 2011 she visited the doctors up to 20 times to report rashes, itches and other problems. One of her GPs told the hearing there was no record she had been told stop using the product but it was 'inconceivable' this advice would not have been given. Doctors do not have to report allergic reactions to hair dye as it is not a substance they prescribe, the inquest heard. Last year £327million of hair colour products were sold in the UK with ten million people colouring their hair every four to eight weeks. Mrs McCabe's husband Russell said in a statement to the inquest that he heard his wife scream and then say to him: 'I'm struggling to breathe, I think I'm going to die,' before lapsing into her coma in October 2011. After the inquest, Mr McCabe said: 'Julie was a wonderful wife and fantastic mother to our two children. We miss her every single day and her loss has torn our family apart. 'To lose any loved one is devastating enough but to lose someone in these circumstances at such a young age has been too much to bear. We will never recover from this loss. 'But we hope that some good can come of this tragedy and that people are now more aware of the potential dangers of these sorts of products. Had there been clearer warnings about the severe reactions on the labels it may have prevented this from ever happening.' Carol Hopwood, of the law firm Slater and Gordon, representing the family, said: 'Mrs McCabe could never have expected that a routine part of her beauty regime would have such devastating consequences. 'This tragedy highlights how common products contain potentially lethal chemicals and illustrates how important it is that clear warnings are placed on packaging to alert customers of the risk of serious injury or even death from the use of these products. 'It is also vital that doctors are fully aware of the warning signs, what advice they should give patients and when patient should be referred to hospital. 'I would urge anyone who is using products like this and have had any adverse reactions to stop using them immediately and to speak to their doctor.' A L'Oreal spokeswoman said: 'Our thoughts are with Julie McCabe's family. We welcome the coroner's recommendations and will work with the CTPA (Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association) and rest of industry to look at ways to improve gathering of information. The devastated relatives of Julie McCabe arrive at her inquest in Skipton Magistrates' Court . 'We fully support his decision to send a report to BIS (Department of Business, Innovation and Skills) highlighting his, and the industry's, concerns about black henna tattoos. We will support increased industry efforts to build awareness of the allergy risk black henna tattoos can cause. 'Sadly, this tragic accident highlights how important it is to follow safety instructions. 'We strongly recommend consumers read and follow safety and usage instructions clearly printed on our packs and notices. 'As stated on our pack, it is extremely important to do an allergy alert test at least 48 hours before use, each time the hair is coloured. If you have ever experienced any reaction after colouring your hair or any reaction after temporary tattooing with black henna, you should not proceed.' The firm said anyone wanting advice on colouring hair safely should visit becoloursafe.com or contact its consumer care team on 0800 0304 031.","Julie McCabe slipped into a coma after severe reaction to L'Oreal hair dye .

"Suffering: Girls were sold for £600 a time. This picture is posed by a model . During her primary school years, Katie was considered academically gifted and dreamed of becoming a forensic scientist. At home, her loving parents read her bedtime stories and would at times remind her to feed her giant African land snail. But when she turned 12 her life changed forever. Sitting on some steps with a friend in Oxford, Katie was approached by two Pakistani brothers who befriended her with alcohol and cigarettes. She was flattered by the attention they paid her, completely unaware she was being groomed for sexual exploitation until it was too late. For almost three years she was violently and sexually abused by a gang and then sold for sex on hundreds of different occasions to a network of child abusers across Britain. Shockingly, during her ordeal she told police and social services she was being abused, but nothing was done to help her. As some of her abusers started long jail sentences yesterday, Katie spoke for the first time about her three-year nightmare. She told the Daily Mail: ‘By all accounts I was a bit of a geek at school,’ she said. ‘Then six months later I become somebody who went missing all the time, coming back days later, filthy and dirty. 'The sudden change is scary to think about, even now.’ Katie still struggles to comprehend how a girl with upstanding parents – her father is a civil engineer – could fall prey to such abuse. ‘At the start they made out like they wanted to be your friend. Then the intensity crept up. They would put you off everybody. They would say your family was your enemy, your friends were your enemies. Scroll down for videos of police statements . Abuse was carried out at the Nanford Guest House in Oxford. Pictured is a room at the guest house . ‘By this point I thought my teenage . friends wouldn’t like me any more. They would say if you go back to . school no one is going to like you because you’re a slag.’ After several months, the Pakistani men began to ask her for sex, pretending to want a loving relationship with her. But soon they were threatening violence if Katie refused to do what she was told. Brothers Akhtar Dogar (left) and Anjum Dogar (right) were each given a . life sentence with a minimum of 17 years at the Old Bailey . Mohammed Karrar (left), 38, was given life with a . minimum of 20 years for the 'dreadful offences' he committed against . the girls. His brother Bassam Karrar (right), 34, was also handed a life . sentence with a minimum of 15 years . ‘It’s something I felt I had to do,’ she said. ‘Although I knew what sex was, there’s a difference between . having sex as an adult and as a child. This was people taking advantage . of a child.’ As her ordeal intensified, Katie was . taken to rooms in guest houses and flats in the backstreets of east . Oxford. ‘I was taken to parties,’ she recalled. ‘By party I mean everybody coming and having sex with me. If I said I didn’t want it, it would just happen anyway.’ Kamar Jamil (left), 27, was jailed for life with . a minimum term of 12 years while Assad Hussain (right) , 32, was . sentenced to seven years in prison . Zeeshan Ahmed, 28, was jailed for seven years for two counts of sexual activity with a child . On some occasions there were up to ten . men were in the room, waiting to have sex with her. Katie said: ‘They just thought they could do what they wanted with me, no matter how disgusting. It got to the point where I just went along with things. 'Mentally I shut down and just did it.’ Aged 14, and by now in a care home, she alerted her carer to the abuse but was ignored. A month after her 15th birthday, she told police that one of her abusers, Akhtar Dogar, was forcing her to have sex with him and other men. But instead of following up these allegations, she said officers threatened to arrest her for wasting police time. ‘My behaviour and appearance should have been sending alarm bells,’ she said. Although Katie is now in a long-term relationship, memories of her past still haunt her. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder at the age of 15 and suffers from severe bouts of depression and OCD.","Katie was academically gifted and dreamed of becoming a forensic scientist .

"The sultan of Brunei has rejected foreign criticism of the countries impending introduction of a form of strict Islamic Sharia law, saying it is not a backwards step. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah said all races should unite under Sharia law and that the new penal code was a 'great achievement' for the small Southeast Asian nation. Starting in April, Brunei will begin implementing a version of Sharia that allows for penalties such as amputation for theft and stoning for adultery. Islamic law: Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, pictured with his wife at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, said all races should unite under Sharia law, and that it is a great achievement for Brunei to implement it . Under limited circumstances, punishments can be applied to non-Muslim residents of the oil-rich country, according to those who have seen the law. Public criticism of the government is extremely rare in the country, but some citizens have turned to the Internet to express alarm at the law. Around one-third of Brunei's 440,000 people are non-Muslims, mostly Christian or Buddhist Chinese. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah told legislators Thursday that all races should unite and support the laws, which he said were a 'great achievement for the country, and not a backward or old-fashioned step.' The Sultan, with Prince Charles, is implementing a version of Sharia that allows for penalties such as amputation for theft and stoning for adultery . The plans have alarmed international human rights groups, but Bolkiah said 'people outside of Brunei should respect us in the same way that we respect them.' Brunei is a conservative country where alcohol is banned and Muslim courts already govern family affairs. Officials have said that punishments under the new laws will not be carried out until around 2017. Muslims in next door Malaysia are subject to a limited form of Islamic law that does not include amputation or capital punishment, as does Aceh province on the western tip of Indonesia. In general, the interpretation and practice of Islam in Southeast Asia is more liberal than in parts of the Middle East and South Asia.","Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah said all races should unite under Sharia law .

It was the third day running this week Mr Burns has gone to work by train after being railroaded into not using his chauffeur-driven car. There was an outcry after a Sunday newspaper reported it cost the taxpayer £80,000 a year. Mr Burns, a Tory Minister of State with responsibility for ‘rail strategy’ and ‘fares policy’, denied his journeys into London from his home cost that figure.

Rough and tumble: Mr Burns was unable to get a seat on the train so was forced to stand up and he is pictured battling through the crowds at a busy Liverpool Street Station . Mr Burns appeared to feel the cold as he stepped out at Liverpool Street Station . He uses a Department for Transport . pool car, he said, which, because of ‘flat rate’ charges which apply . regardless how many journeys are made, would cost £80,000 even if he did . not make the 35-mile commute in it. But after mounting pressure from . commuters and fellow politicians, he decided to ‘adjust’ his working . practices and how he travels to and from work. ‘My previous arrangements were not intended as a snub to hard-pressed rail travellers,’ he added. Mr . Burns claimed he took the car from his Chelmsford home only because he . was barred from working on his Red Box of official Ministerial papers on . the train for security reasons, the Mail on Sunday reported. But he was contradicted by the Cabinet . Office, which said Ministers could work on papers in public as long as . they ensured sensitive material could not be seen. So where were Mr Burns’ Red Boxes were when he caught the train yesterday? His . spokesman said: ‘He has changed his habits more broadly than just how . he travels. He is working later in the office so not having to travel . with the boxes.’ The spokesman added that the boxes were not transported . by another means but stayed in the office instead. It . was unclear if Mr Burns has bought a season ticket, but his spokesman . insisted the change to his travel habits was ‘not just this week, but . on-going’.","Outcry when it was revealed Simon Burns was being driven to work .

"Just an average British girl: A photo of 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite taken from her fake South African passport released by Kenyan police . 'White widow' Islamist Samantha Lewthwaite was just an average British girl who was 'empty in confidence', a councillor who knew her as a youngster has said. But today suspicion is mounting that she was the ringleader behind a bloody massacre in a Kenyan shopping centre in which more than 60 unarmed victims have been slain. And it has emerged that her frail 85-year-old grandmother has been admitted to hospital because of the stress of her granddaughter's notoriety. Elizabeth Allen, from Banbridge, Co Down, was given a panic alarm to contact security services in case terror suspect Lewthwaite ever made contact. Family friends say the pressure of the situation and Lewthwaite's now-global notoriety have taken their toll on the frail pensioner's health and mental well-being. Joan Baird, a veteran Ulster Unionist councillor in Banbridge who knows the family, said: 'This is so distressing for everyone. Mrs Allen is 85 and she is in and out of hospital. It is just so distressing. 'Certainly, everybody in the town is shocked and distressed by the news.' Lewthwaite from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, who converted to Islam age 17, was married to Jermaine Lindsay before he blew himself up in the July 7 terror attacks in London in 2005, killing 26. The 29-year-old mother of three is already wanted by Kenyan police over alleged links to a terrorist cell that planned to bomb the country’s coast. Moody: Lewthwaite from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, who converted to Islam age 17, was married to Jermaine Lindsay before he blew himself up in the July 7 terror attacks in London in 2005, killing 26 . Now it is suspected that she was the mastermind behind the four-day gun and bomb attack on Westgate Shopping Centre in Nairobi, which has led to a continuing siege in which more than 60 people have lost their lives. Born to English soldier Andy . Lewthwaite - who met and married Irish Catholic Christine Allen while . serving in Northern Ireland during the 1970s - she enjoyed an . unremarkable childhood on Banbridge's Whyte Acres estate. Lewthwaite was still at primary school when her family moved to Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. In 1995 her parents split. Councillor Raj Khan, whose family knew Lewthwaite’s family socially in Aylesbury, said he is surprised at speculation she is involved in the attack in Kenya due to how he remembers her. Read all about it: A Kenyan vendor sells a newspaper with an article on its front page about Lewthwaite's alleged involvement in the terror attack which began on Saturday in Nairobi and has claimed more than 60 lives . 'She was an average, British, young, . ordinary girl. She had a very great personality. She didn’t have very . good confidence,' he said. Lewthwaite at school aged 16 or 17: She is the daughter of a British soldier father and an Northern Irish Catholic mother who split up in 1995 . After . becoming a Muslim, Lewthwaite changed her name to Sherafiyah and . married suicide bomber Lindsay, who she had met on an Islamic internet . chatroom. Mr Khan recalled a meeting with . Lewthwaite and Lindsay regarding a housing issue which took place three . or four weeks before the July 7 bombings, and he said she was just as he . remembered her. 'Certainly when I was around her, she was the same person, lacking in confidence. 'She . was not strong-headed. And that’s why I find it absolutely amazing that . she is supposed to be the head of an international criminal terrorist . organisation,' he said. Mr Khan said he was 'perplexed' that . someone he knew, who was so 'empty in confidence', was being linked to . international terrorism. He . said he prays that she is not involved, adding: '...and of course my . worry is that if she in involved, is she under some kind of duress? Is . there other factors involved? 'Or indeed, is it Samantha? I mean there are so many questions to be answered at the moment before one can make a view.' Mr Khan said her family will be 'very upset' if she is involved. 'Of . course like anyone else, they will be very hurt, very upset, very, very . upset, but I think they too will be waiting for proof, not . speculation,' he said. Suspicion . that Lewthwaite was in the attack in Nairobi were raised after the . Kenyan foreign minister claimed that a British woman who has has . allegedly been involved in terrorism 'many times before' was among the . militants. The Aylesbury home of Andy Lewthwaite, Samantha's father: Lewthwaite was still at primary school when her family moved from Banbridge, Northern Ireland to to Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire . Amina Mohamed . said the woman acted alongside 'two or three' Americans as security . forces began a fourth day of fighting at the shopping centre where at . least six Britons are known to have died. A British policeman has testified in Kenya in the trial of a Briton accused of plotting attacks and who has ties to al-Shabaab, the Somali group behind a weekend attack on the shopping mall. Jermaine Grant (pictured below today in court), of East London, was arrested in December 2011 in a raid by Kenyan anti-terrorism police on his apartment in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa, along with a female accomplice, Warda Breik, who police said was his wife. Police said a third suspect, believed to be Samantha Lewthwaite, escaped in that raid. Grant and Warda face charges of being found in possession of explosive material recovered from their apartment, and a conspiracy to commit a felony, charges they both deny. Robert Garric, a detective constable with New Scotland Yard police, working in the forensic management team under the counter-terrorism command, told the court he had been part of a team deployed to assist Kenyan police. Mr Garric said he and his team were told by Kenyan police that ‘they were looking at a plot to detonate explosives in parts of Kenya.’ He said he had been informed that a Briton, Grant, had been arrested using a false Canadian identity. The detectives were led to a government laboratory where they were conducting tests on chemicals recovered from Grant's apartment, Mr Garric said. Mr Garric, a bomb scene examiner, manager and counter-terrorism investigator, said the kind of chemicals found, if mixed for a short time, could make explosives that ‘could detonate easily when exposed to shock or flame.’ Earlier this month, Grant was acquitted by a Nairobi court of robbery with violence, charges that could have carried the death penalty, but remained in custody because of the trial in Mombasa. Prosecutor Jacob Ondari said three detectives from Scotland Yard were among his witnesses. However . there was confusion over Ms Mohamed’s comments - made while attending . the United Nations General Assembly in New York - with no confirmation . either from the authorities in Nairobi or the Foreign Office in London. They . directly contradict the Kenyan interior minister Joseph Ole Lenku who . yesterday told a news conference that all the attackers were male - . although he suggested that some may have been dressed as women. The Foreign Office said only that it was aware of the foreign minister’s comments. 'We . continue to liaise very closely with the Kenyan authorities and to . support their investigation into this attack,' a spokesman said. After . her husband Lindsay detonated his suicide bomb at on a Piccadilly line . tube train between King's Cross and Russell Square stations in 2005, . Lewthwaite had told how she was horrified by the massacre. But the Jamaican-born Muslim convert, who grew up in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, had never made a secret of his extremist views, alarming teachers by attempting to radicalise younger pupils. In 2009 Lewthwaite disappeared with her three children but resurfaced two years later after travelling to Kenya on a false passport. The Kenyan authorities issued a photograph of a white woman in a veil who they said was wanted for questioning about a bomb factory in the coastal resort of Mombassa. The woman was Lewthwaite. It is understood she has had little contact with relatives in Northern Ireland since her conversion to Islam. Mr Khan said he does not think the speculation surrounding Lewthwaite will cause divisions in Aylesbury due to the community’s maturity. 'Of course if it is Samantha indeed, of course they’ll be very hurt, very upset, as indeed any human being would be, but in terms of causing any differences in our community I think the community is far more mature for that kind of thing,' he said. Stuart Osborne, who was until recently the Met's Head of Counter Terrorism Command, told ITV News that any role Lewthwaite has with Islamist militant group al-Shabaab is unclear. He said: ‘Lewthwaite has obviously been involved in terrorism or connected with terrorists for some considerable time now. Her role in al-Shabaab is very unclear or even if she has a role within (it). ‘She is currently wanted by the Kenyan authorities in relation to an investigation for those who have committed acts of terrorism. But as yet she is untried and unconvicted for those offences. ‘Traditionally she would be seen to be somebody as a sympathiser, a facilitator or an instigator of terrorism. ‘She has certainly got a large media profile, certainly in the British media press in relation to her activities and her involvement in terrorist activities is still yet to be proven, but as I said she is still wanted for terrorist offences.’","Samantha Lewthwaite's 85-year-old grandmother in hospital with stress .

"Held: Faruq Khalil Muhammad 'Isa, 36, pleaded not guilty after being extradited to the United States on Friday to stand trial charges of providing material support to terrorists . A Canadian citizen pleaded not guilty Saturday to charges he wired money and provided support to Tunisian extremists who committed a 2009 suicide attack in Iraq that killed five American soldiers. Faruq Khalil Muhammad 'Isa, 36, entered the plea in federal court in Brooklyn after being extradited to the United States on Friday to stand trial on terror charges. The Iraqi national was charged in connection with a 2009 suicide bombing in Mosul that killed soldiers outside US Army Forward Operating Base Marez, Muhammad 'Isa's indictment stated. Muhammad 'Isa confessed to speaking with two of the men believed to be involved in the attack over email while they were in Syria, according to his extradition request. The request also alleges that he talked with others who acted as 'facilitators' working to get the jihadists access into Iraq, sending one $700. The New York Daily News reports that another jihadist arrested shortly after the bombing admitted in an interview that Muhammad 'Isa 'regularly communicated' with him about killing Americans in Iraq. 'Did you hear about the huge incident yesterday? ... He was one of the Tunisian brothers,' the indictment states Muhammad 'Isa wrote to a collaborator a day after the attack, according to court documents. A wiretap caught Muhammad 'Isa referring to the terrorists in code as 'farmers (who) plant metal and harvest metal and flesh,' according to the indictment. Authorities arrested Muhammad 'Isa in Canada on a US warrant in 2011 after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, assisted by US, Canadian and Tunisian authorities. After being extradited to the US, he was indicted on seven counts of providing material support and murder by a Brooklyn grand jury. The charges carry a life sentence if he's convicted. US Attorney Loretta Lynch said the arrest 'demonstrates to those who orchestrate violence against our citizens and our soldiers that there is no corner of the globe from which they can hide from the long reach of the law.'","Faruq Khalil Muhammad 'Isa is charged with providing material support and murder after allegedly wiring money to a terrorist group .

"As she stepped on stage at the finals of the Miss Great Britain pageant last weekend, few would have guessed that winner Shelby Tribble, 21, lacked confidence. But Miss Tribble, who describes herself as 'painfully shy', says she not only had to overcome a lack of confidence, she also had to deal with the legacy of being bullied at school. According to the glamorous 21-year-old, from Plymouth in Devon, cruel school bullies taunted her about her shyness and left her feeling less confident than ever. Scroll down for video . She suffered bullying throughout school due to her intense shyness and lack of confidence . But all that changed when she was pulled out of a crowd by a talent spotter while visiting the Clothes Show Live with her mother. Then 15, the shy youngster was persuaded to enter the Teen Queen beauty pageant - and was amazed when she came second. Miss Tribble, of Plymouth, Devon, says that was enough to turn the tables on her tormentors and begin the journey to her Miss Great Britain crown. 'I was painfully shy when I was younger and used to get bullied until one day I decided that I wasn't going to put up with it any more and decided to prove the bullies wrong,' she explains. ''I never used to stand up for myself but now I would not allow it any more because I'm a lot stronger.' The 21-year-old was spotted when out one day with her mother and says modelling and competing in pageants has help rebuild her confidence . Shelby, here competing in Miss Great Britain as Miss South West before she won, has not always been so self confident . The model originally wanted to become a Team GB diver and joined her local team on the same day as future Olympic hero Tom Daley. As a child she suffered a collapsed lung and needed emergency surgery, before turning to diving in a bid to boost her recovery. Miss Tribble, who now lives in London, also modelled part time for fashion student friends and squeezed in assignments at weekends. Eventually, she decided to move to London to pursue modelling full-time but even then, her mother Karen, 50, says she was still inexplicably shy. 'It was to do with her confidence again because she's quite a perfectionist and never thought she was good enough so she would stress over it,' she explains. 'After a bad night out when she came home upset, I said to her that everyone was always saying that she should go to London and do some modelling and why didn't she give it a go. Shelby, third from right, was crowned Miss Great Britain 2014 at a glittering award ceremony this weekend . 'So she moved to London, worked full time and started doing the modelling on weekends. It was really difficult at first because she was up there on her own and it's a big place.' But the blonde has never looked back and has since won Miss Great Britain and Miss Hippodrome, as well as completing modelling assignments for men's magazines. Miss Tribble has also appeared on The Only Way Is Essex, has starred in several TV ads and has been signed up with two modelling agencies. Now dating Barnsley footballer Conor Hourihane, a delighted Miss Tribble added: 'If you know what you want to do you've just got to go chase it and even though it's hard work and sometimes takes a long time to get there, you can do it. 'I've worked so hard and sometimes things haven't worked out but I don't let it get me down, I just carry on to the next thing and keep going.'","Shelby Tribble, 21, was crowned Miss Great Britain at the weekend .

"China and Russia are considering building a high-speed rail line thousands of kilometres from Moscow to Beijing that would cut the journey time from six days on the Trans-Siberian to two. The project would cost more than $230bn (£144bn) and be over 7,000km (4,350 miles) long - more than three times the world's current longest high-speed line, from the Chinese capital to the southern city of Guangzhou. The railway would be a powerful physical symbol of the ties that bind Moscow and Beijing, whose political relationship has roots dating from the Soviet era and who often vote together on the UN Security Council. The new proposed high-speed rail line would cut journey time between Moscow and Beijing by four days . The £144bn construction would mean trains wouldn't have to travel through Mongolian capital Ulan Bator . There are various routes along the Trans-Siberian railway that link Russia with the Far East . They have strengthened their relationship as Western criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin mounts over Ukraine and other issues. The two signed a memorandum of understanding earlier this week during Premier Li Keqiang's visit to Moscow in which Beijing expressed interest in building a fast rail link between the Russian capital and Kazan in the oil-rich Tatarstan region, state broadcaster China Central Television reported. The 803-kilometre line would be the first stage of the route to Beijing, CCTV said. At present, trains between the two run along the Trans-Siberian railway that links Moscow and Vladivostok, before switching to a branch line heading south through the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator. The Trans-Siberian route connects Moscow with Beijing - but takes at least six days to travel . As well as cutting journey time between Moscow and Beijing, the service would miss out remote locations . The current Trans-Siberian route takes six days between Beijing and Moscow . Relations between China and Russia are strong, so a new rail link is very much a possibility . Direct passenger trains between Beijing and Moscow went into operation in 1954 and there are still two services per week, CCTV said. The new link would cut the train travel time from six days at present to under two days, the Beijing Times quoted Wang Mengshu, a tunnel and railway expert at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, as saying. 'If the funds are raised smoothly... the line can be completed in five years at the quickest,' he added. The paper cited a research report that put the cost of one kilometre of Chinese-built fast rail at $33 million. In two days passengers will be able to take on board a whole new culture . Direct passenger trains between Moscow and Beijing went into service in 1954 . The new rail link symbolise the unity between Russia and China (Pictured is Russian President Vladimir Putin and China Premier Li Keqiang) The country has the world's largest high-speed rail network, built from scratch in less than a decade, relying on technology transfer from foreign companies, including France's Alstom, Germany's Siemens and Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries. Its reputation was tarnished after a bullet train collision in July 2011 near the eastern city of Wenzhou that killed at least 40 people and injured hundreds. But China is now keen to promote the export of its technology, and has been building high-speed rail networks in Turkey and Venezuela. The Tran-Siberia route is an important one for trade as well as commercial . There is no train which is named the trans-Siberian Express. The Moscow-Vladivostok route is served by the Rossiya, whereas Moscow-Beijing routes are usually achieved by using a combination of sectors on different trains. All of the routes are working trains and travellers journey with locals, according to Trans-siberian.co.uk. At 9,216km (Moscow-Vladivostok) it is the longest direct rail route in the world, and entirely within Russia. The Moscow-Beijing route is shorter, at 9,001km. The original Trans-Siberian railway was built from Moscow to Vladivostok on the orders of Tsar Alexander III. Despite the appeal of following the original route, in practice most people are dissuaded from Vladivostok by three factors: poor availability of onward connections to Asia or return flights to Europe; the greater tourism possibilities of Beijing (pop 15m) compared to Vladivostok (pop 600,000); missing the chance to visit Mongolia en-route. The route more favoured today is from Moscow to Beijing on the historic Manchurian route and takes a week. The alternative Trans-Mongolian route via Ulan Bator to Beijing saves 16 hours (and 1,136km). The route to Vladivostok was built between 1891 and 1916. The 'first rivet' was ceremonially hammered home by the future Nicholas II, the last Tsar. Under Communist rule he would later be taken to House Arrest as a prisoner on board the Trans-Siberian. The journey spans eight time zones. The Trans-Siberian is longer than the Great Wall of China and US Route 66. Since Russia and Mongolia use broad gauge railways while China uses the standard gauge, there is a break-of-gauge, meaning that carriages to or from China cannot simply cross the border, and each carriage has to be lifted in turn to have its bogies changed. The whole operation, combined with passport and customs control, can take several hours.","Current journey time on Trans-Siberian route takes six days .

"St Petersburg is only three-and-a-half hours by express train from the Russian capital, Moscow, but it could be a different country. In a city of Italian, not Stalinist architects, it would be easy to forget you are in Russia. Peter the Great, it is said, hated Moscow. And when he founded his modern capital at the mouth of the Neva River in 1703, he looked to the West for inspiration. In the course of the next 100 years, his court built the city's magnificent baroque and neo-classical palaces. Colours and shapes: St Petersburg boasts grand landmarks such as the Church of the Saviour on Spilled Blood . Today, visitors flock to the Peter and Paul Fortress, with its sombre Romanov tombs, the massive St Isaac's Cathedral and the Hermitage Museum, that treasure trove of European art (look out for its army of cats, introduced by Empress Elizabeth in 1745 to keep the resident rats at bay). The Yusupov Palace should not be missed. From 1710 to the Revolution, it was home to four generations of this colourful family. They included Nicholas, one of Catherine the Great's art buyers; Dimitri, a lover of Coco Chanel (the shape of the No.5 perfume bottle is said to be based on his hip flask); and Felix, who once gave the ballerina Anna Pavlova a silk dress studded with rubies and diamonds for her performance in Swan Lake. It was the same Felix who fed Rasputin cookies laced with cyanide. Art of the matter: The Hermitage - the former Winter Palace of the Tsars - is one of the world's great galleries . Above all, St Petersburg - built on 42 islands and spanned by hundreds of bridges — is best experienced on foot. Lewis Carroll noted on his visit there in 1867: 'I feel as if I could and should be content to do nothing for many days but roam about it.' Stroll along the pastel-coloured Neva Embankment as days lengthen into White Nights (where from around May to the end of July, it never gets darker than twilight), and watch the bridges open to allow ships through to the Baltic. Then, the city is rent in two, making access to the other side impossible - 'and providing a convenient excuse for errant husbands', my guide says wryly. By day, enjoy vistas that inspired Pushkin ('I love thee, Peter's bold creation'). St Petersburg is undergoing a beautification process, with restorations and smart new apartments constructed behind old facades. It boasts the fabulous Mariinsky II opera house, a new concert hall, Russia's largest privately-owned contemporary art museum and, in the 19th century General Staff Building, a natty new wing for the Hermitage. An imperial wonder: The decor and fittings within the Hermitage are as impressive as the art on its wide walls . Meanwhile, Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich has bought Peter the Great's historic navy warehouses on New Holland island and, with girlfriend Dasha Zhukova, plans to restore them for use as a multi-purpose cultural complex, slated for completion in 2018. On the bling front, St Petersburg remains some way behind Moscow. But that, too, is being addressed. Designer shops fill the former market of Gostiny Dvor, and expensively elegant department stores, such as the new DLT, tempt the average citizen with goods he or she couldn't possibly afford. Meanwhile, hip restaurants and bars with names such as Meat Head, Mansarda, Berlin Season and Tao are mushrooming in lofts and the old court stables area - our own Jamie Oliver was one of the first foreign celebrity chefs to make his mark in the city with his Italian-themed eatery. This is where you can find the fabled New Russians, elegantly draped and heeled, their Porsches double-parked outside. Snowy splendour: The city's buildings - such as the Alexander Nevsky Monastery - look even grander in winter . How different from my first visit, in the bad ol' days of Communism. In the Eighties, I was billeted in the dour Leningrad Hilton. Today, visitors can enjoy quasi-imperial opulence. Belmond (Orient Express) has taken over the Grand Hotel Europe and created a magnificent Heritage wing; and Rocco Forte has given the Astoria (where Hitler had planned, somewhat prematurely, to hold his victory dinner) a facelift. Driving along the Neva, I passed what looked like a 19th-century warehouse, romantically lit by moonlight. Sated by so much grandeur, I thought it would make an industrial-chic alternative to the lavish hotel scene. 'That?' said my guide, incredulously. 'It is the oldest-serving prison in Russia!' Such is the charm of St Petersburg that even its prison exerts a certain allure. From the outside, at least. Regent Holidays (020 7666 1244, www.regent-holidays.co.uk) has four nights at the Grand Hotel Europe B&B from £970pp, including BA flights and private transfers.","Russia's second city is increasingly alive with chic bars and fashion stores .

"Anthony Waters, 48, killed himself moments after British Gas workers turned up and switched off the electricity at his store . A shopkeeper struggling with debts killed himself moments after British Gas workers turned up and switched off the electricity at his store. Anthony Waters, 48, told the workmen he could give them £1,000 of his £5,000 debt. But despite him warning he would hang himself, and telling them he ‘had the rope ready’ they insisted they must ‘de-energise’ the store, an inquest heard. He then closed the shutters and locked up his shop. The . British Gas team dismissed his comments as an ‘idle threat’ but called . the police from outside the store just in case, the inquest in Bradford . was told. Mr Waters was later found dead inside by police officers. Yesterday the energy giant was condemned by Mr Waters’s father for ‘bullying’ his son into committing suicide. Keith . Waters said: ‘I think Anthony felt he had let us down. He was pushed to . the point of desperation by a big corporation bullying him because it . couldn’t give a bit of leeway to a single man struggling and he was . pushed over the edge. I think it is disgusting. ‘I’m . sure they could have arranged for another payment scheme if things were . getting that bad. I don’t understand why British Gas had to send three . men to his shop without any warning. It was a bit heavy-handed and these . companies forget the human side of things. Where is their humanity?’ Mr Waters senior, 87, set up Waters Mini-Mart in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 1969. The family built up a commercial property portfolio using a £300,000 bank loan. But they hit financial problems and three of their shops had to be closed. Anthony reopened the general store last February and ‘things were on the mend’, until the bank called in the loan and British Gas demanded payment for the electricity bills. The firm said that although Mr Waters was not told the date supplies would be cut off, there had been two years of discussions before their visit. Mr Waters would also have been told they were getting a court warrant to disconnect his electricity. Keith Walters stands inside his son's shop, Waters Mini-Mart in Bradford, while holding a bill from British Gas . David Pickard, a British Gas warrant officer, arrived with a locksmith and an engineer at 9am on July 22. Mr Pickard said he discussed the situation with Mr Waters before the electricity was cut off, adding: ‘He clearly felt he should have been given more time to pay.’ Referring to Mr Waters’s threat to hang himself, he said: ‘I thought it was just a throwaway comment, an idle threat. In my line of work I hear people say it quite regularly and think nothing of it.’ He added that he believed the shopkeeper was ‘trying to make us feel sorry for him so we would not go ahead’. The British Gas workers waited until police arrived, who asked the locksmith to pick the lock so they could get inside. Mr Waters, middle, with his father Keith, who has accused British Gas of 'bullying his son, and his mother Beryl . Sarah Bland, who runs a hair salon next to the shop and rented her property from the family, saw Mr Waters as he locked up the shop, looking flushed and holding a green bin bag. ‘I said “are you shut” and he said “yes, shut for good.” I believe there must have been a rope in the bag when I saw him,’ she said. Recording a suicide verdict, coroner Oliver Longstaff said Mr Waters had been ‘put on the spot’ by the British Gas team. ‘He was a man who had done his best for a long time to keep the family business, which he took great pride in, in good health,’ he said. ‘He realised he couldn’t do that for any longer and took a view that all that was left was to end his life.’ British Gas spokesman Leonie Edwards said: ‘We were very saddened by the death of Mr Waters and we would like to express our sincere sympathies to his family.’","Anthony Waters was visited by British Gas workers at his store .

"The fiancée of a father-of-two who drowned after being swept into water trying to rescue his dog has told of the moment she frantically tried to save her partner who could not swim. Joanne Wardle and Alex Hardy were walking his pet on Hendon Beach in Sunderland when the 32-year-old fell on a slip way where his dog was chasing a pebble in September. A poor swimmer, the security guard was struggling in the water when Miss Wardle jumped in to try to save him. Joanne Wardle recalled the frantic moment she tried to save partner Alex Hardy as he drowned in the sea . But she too was overpowered by the current and was unable to keep her partner from drowning. She said: 'There was this awful crack as his head hit the ground and for a few seconds he just lay there. 'Then another massive wave came crashing in and swept him in.' 'When I saw he was in the water I didn't even have to think about what to do. 'I knew he couldn't swim but I am a strong swimmer. I just thought if I could get to him and get hold of him everything would be fine. 'But as I jumped in, the current took my legs away and I tumbled in the water, coming up near Alex. That’s when I knew it was really serious. 'I got to Alex, he was conscious but not responsive. I got hold of him but I know the fall had incapacitated him. The couple were then separated again and the dog, Fudge, tried to reach his owner. 'We then got separated again. I tried to hold on to him but the waves just separated us.

He was shouting to me to time the waves. That really helped but I couldn’t reach it. I got very light-headed and shouted to the fisherman ‘I can’t do this.’ Ms Wardle, who had planned to marry Mr Hardy in 2016, was rescued by an RNLI crew shortly afterwards. Mr Hardy, however, could not be reached for hours. Michelle Taylor said she missed her son every day . At an inquest into his death, Ms Wardle described her late partner as 'the love of my life'. 'Alex was such a loud, lovable character. From the moment we first met we just looked at each other and  knew we were going to be together. 'He was so caring. He was my world, the love of my life.' Mr Hardy was an NHS security guard with two sons, aged 12 and 11, from a previous relationship. Miss Wardle said: 'Fudge and I are the same, I don't think either of us can quite believe he has gone. 'Every time a car pulls up in the street his ears prick up.' Describing his death, coroner Vicky Ross said: 'He was swept into the sea. Alex wasn’t a swimmer. 'Miss Wardle herself bravely went into the sea herself. Unfortunately Alex couldn’t be rescued. Recording a verdict of accidental death by drowning, the coroner told Miss Wardle:  'You did everything you could to rescue him.' Later, his mother said drowning had been one of Mr Hardy's biggest fears. 'His biggest fears of death were drowning or fire but it was the drowning that took him.' 'He was a fun loving man who lived for his boys. He loved his family - it meant the world to him. 'I miss him every day.'","Alex Hardy drowned trying to save his beloved pet dog Fudge in the sea .

"Paddling directly towards a great white shark would be a surfer's worst nightmare. But these two paddle boarders were completely unaware of the potential dangers lurking just metres from them when they took to the surf on the NSW Central Coast last Friday. Footage shot by drone pilot Tom Caska captured the moment a huge shark started following a sea of fish 50 metres off the shore at Killcare Beach. Scroll down for video . Drone pilot Tom Caska captured the moment a huge shark started following a sea of fish 50 metres off the shore at Killcare Beach on the NSW Central Coast last Friday . Mr Caska's brother Andrew was on one of the three-metre long paddle boards when the shark started circling. But remarkably, no one was fully aware of how close he came until they looked back on the drone footage. 'Andie had a heart attack when he saw this... Scary stuff,' Mr Caska wrote on Facebook. The shark, believed to be a great white, and the school of fish are clearly visibly in the aerial photo just metres from several surfers. Mr Caska's brother Andrew was on  the red three-metre long paddle board (top) when the shark started circling, but was completely unaware of his close call until he saw the footage . Mr Caska said his brother was paddling over a wave and only saw 'a bit of a swirl', but no sign of the shark. 'Came in after that big school of fish. Must be careful in the water this time of year as the whites migrate south again,' he wrote. It comes after a 50-year-old man was killed after a suspected great white attacked him at Byron Bay earlier this month. Paul Wilcox was swimming 15-metres from shore on the main beach when a shark mauled his leg.

"Million pound holiday: Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud has allegedly booked up three whole resorts for his official visit . Tourists looking forward to a dream holiday in the Maldives have had to change their plans after a Saudi prince reportedly booked out three entire island resorts exclusively for himself. The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud is understood to have taken over the five-star paradise resorts for nearly a month. It is believed the 78-year-old heir to the Saudi throne paid £18million ($30million) for the  resorts of Anantara Veli, Naladhu and Anantara Dighu from February 19 to March 15. According to a report on the website maldivesfinest.com, the Saudi prince was due to arrive in the Maldives with a floating hospital, a luxury yacht and more than 100 bodyguards. But the last minute booking has upset ‘normal’ holidaymakers who have had their reservations cancelled. Posting a review on the travel website Trip Advisor, one disgruntled holidaymaker who was due to stay at the Antantara Veli resort, wrote: ‘Our reservation was cancelled with NO notice and we were informed only AFTER we contacted them. ‘Back in December we booked the Anantara Veli in an overwater pool villa for a four night stay in early March. ‘Three weeks prior to our departure we emailed the Anantara Veli to confirm our airport pick up and a few other details. ‘As a result of our email to Anantara and a call to our booking agent we finally learned that the hotel had simply cancelled our reservation and, I assume, those of many others. They did this without apprising us of this cancellation. ‘Here's what Anantara finally told us: In essence they said they now have a booking for the period including 19 February until March 15 which, after negotiations, developed into a request for total private island buyout of Anantara Veli and Naladhu. 'Not ""I'm sorry"", not ""we should have notified you"", now ""how can we make it up to you"". Just ""this is now the situation"".’ Royal guest: The Anantara Naladhu Hotel on Veliganduhuraa Island, South Male Atoll, is now 'fully booked' according the the hotel chain's website . The holidaymaker, going by the name Buford33, said he was offered a ‘less desirable resort’ as an alternative, but he turned this down. He wrote: ‘The message we took away . was ""to hell with clients who took the time to book in advance if we can . make more money through a single group, total island booking"".’ A . spokeswoman for the Anantara resorts insisted all their guests were . happy with the alternative accommodation they had been offered. She . said: ‘At Anantara Hotels, Resorts & Spas, the wellbeing of our . guests is always our primary concern and we consistently seek to address . and allay any queries or concerns that are brought to our attention. All the bungalows at the hotel Anantara Veli Island which can be seen in this photograph has allegedly been booked up by the Crown Prince and his entourage . ‘Whilst we are not at liberty to discuss individual reservations or visits, we would like to share that on the rare occasion that a change occurs in the status of a booking, we try our utmost to ensure the guest's satisfaction throughout the process.’ Attempts to book rooms in any of the three Anantara hotels during the period of the Crown Prince's stay were met with a 'fully booked' message on the hotel group's website. Prince Salman is visiting the Maldives in an offical capacity at the invitation of Abdulla Yameen, president of the Republic of Maldives, the Saudi Arabian Foreign Ministry confirmed earlier this month. The Saudi Arabian Embassy has been contacted by MailOnline for comment.","Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud allegedly booked three Maldives resorts .

"A girl aged seven was taped to her chair in class during a humiliating bullying campaign by her teacher and classroom assistant, a court heard yesterday. The pupil is also said to have been shut in a store room and had Post-it notes attached to her thumbs to prevent her from sucking them. Other children in the class laughed as the girl was subjected to the supposedly ‘good-humoured’ pranks by teacher Deborah McDonald, 41, and classroom assistant Rachael Regan, 43. Teaching assistant Rachael Regan, 43, (right) and teacher Deborah McDonald, 41, (left) are accused of taping a seven-year-old pupil to a chair and shut her in a storeroom during a five-month campaign of bullying . Police investigated the child’s treatment after she ran out of the school crying and her mother complained. The prosecution said she was ‘singled out and bullied on a regular basis’ over a five-month period by both members of staff at the primary school in Calderdale, West Yorkshire. The court heard Regan used Sellotape, which was wrapped around the girl more than once, to fasten her to the chair for around ten minutes, with her arms by her sides. Simon Waley, prosecuting, told the jury: ‘She said that Mrs Regan put it all around the chair and it was hard breathing. She said that she couldn’t get out to reach her things. She said that the whole class were laughing.’ The girl came out of school at home time in a distressed state before telling her mother she had been tied to a chair with tape by a teacher and she could not move. She said the other pupils laughed at her and she was the ‘class clown’. The teaching assistant later said that she did it for ‘a bit of fun’ because the girl had been ‘fidgety’ the court heard. Bradford Crown Court heard that the girl told the police Regan (right) taped her to a chair, while McDonald (left) made a calendar  which included a number of comments and photographs of the girl . Mr Waley said the girl also told police of an incident in which Regan had bound string to her legs and feet to keep her shoes on. He added: ‘She said it was horrible and that, again, everybody had been laughing.’ Other alleged incidents included Regan and McDonald goading the girl with biscuits. Other children had been given biscuits for good homework, the court heard, but she was left out and the defendants told her how delicious they were. Regan is said to have pulled a photograph of the seven-year-old off the wall and ripped it to pieces in front of her. And McDonald allegedly kicked the girl’s chair when she was swinging on it, causing it to ‘jerk forward’. The teacher is said to have dropped the victim’s doll into a drawer before kicking it shut. She also made a calendar to give to colleagues, which allegedly included comments and photos of the girl. The court was told that both Regan (rightt) and McDonald (left) 'were playing their part in this course of conduct, even if they did not each play a physical role in each of the acts complained of' McDonald, from Halifax, and Regan, from Illingworth, went on trial at Bradford Crown Court after denying child cruelty. The alleged bullying took place between September 2012 and January last year. The court heard the women were jointly to blame. Mr Waley said: ‘The prosecution say that they wilfully ill-treated her, in that they pursued a course of conduct in which their systematic treatment of her amounted to bullying. Both were playing their part in this course of conduct, even if they did not each play a physical role in each of the acts complained of.’ Simon Waley, prosecuting, told Bradford Crown Court the defendants gave the children biscuits for good homework but did not include the girl as she had not completed hers . The women were arrested in February last year after the mother complained to the school and the police were called in. Mr Waley said that Regan was questioned about the taping incident and told police that in ‘hindsight’ she ‘shouldn’t have done it but thought it was going to be a bit of fun’. He added: ‘The defendant said that she thought she had a really good relationship with the girl. She said she was a cheeky monkey. She denied that she and McDonald had ever bullied the girl.’ Mr Waley said the defence accepted that some incidents took place, but argued they were fun rather than malicious and the girl ‘had been a participant in the humour’. The prosecutor added: ‘These were not episodes of fun but rather a course of conduct amounting to cruelty.’ The girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, is now aged nine.The trial continues.

"The deteriorating crisis in Iraq has raised fresh questions over President Obama’s plans to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan by the end of 2016. Fears that the hard-fought gains in Afghanistan could be wiped by a resurgent Taliban, came as early this morning four Taliban militants struck a Nato post . in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar, destroying . dozens of trucks and sparking a gun battle with police. But Obama's administration insist the population is far more receptive to a continued U.S. presence, and a top American general says Afghans are better fighters. Scroll down for video . An Afghan policeman stands guard near the scene of an attack in Torkham, Nangarhar province. The deteriorating crisis in Iraq has raised fresh questions over President Obama¿s plans to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan by the end of 2016 . Smoke rises from Nato fuel trucks following an attack in Torkham, Nangarhar province . Afghan officials say three Taliban suicide bombers targeted Nato fuel trucks at the border with Pakistan, setting off a gunbattle with police guards . However the officials could offer no assurances that Afghanistan will not devolve into chaos after Americans leave, as Iraq has. 'There's no guarantee,' Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told a Senate panel Wednesday. 'It is up to the people of Afghanistan to make these decisions, their military, their new leadership that will be coming in as a result of their new government.' The U.S. military mission in Iraq ended in December 2011 after eight years of war that cost hundreds of billions of dollars and more than 4,400 U.S. lives, a conclusion welcomed by a war-weary nation.

U.S. soldiers investigate the scene of an suicide attack in the Torkham, Nangarhar province . The Obama administration had proposed keeping a residual U.S. force in Iraq to continue training Iraqis, but Baghdad rejected Washington's demand that its troops be granted immunity for prosecution while in the country. In the absence of the Americans, the fast-moving Sunni insurgency of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has prevailed over Iraqi security forces, conquering several cities, and is threatening the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described for Congress on Wednesday how some Iraqi security forces abandoned the fight against the ISIL. 'Two divisions and part of two, and one national police organization did in fact throw down their arms and in some cases collude with (ISIL) and in some cases simply desert in northern Iraq,' Dempsey said. . Last month, Obama announced that about 10,000 troops would stay in Afghanistan at the end of this year but be fully withdrawn by the end of 2016.

US Soldiers and Afghan security officials inspect the scene of the suicide bomb attacks . At least two women were killed and six persons were injured in the explosion . In a private White House meeting Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pressed Obama about his definitive timetable for drawing down American troops, especially in light of the crisis in Iraq. The president defended his plan as the right approach, according to a congressional aide familiar with the talks who wouldn't discuss it publicly by name because the meeting was private. At two separate hearings on Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats pressed administration officials about whether history would repeat itself and whether Afghan forces could defend the country after the U.S. leaves. The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., asked whether the timeline 'emboldens militants in the country to wait (us) out.' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., predicted a reconstituted Taliban will threaten Afghanistan as the ISIL has done in Iraq. President Hamid Karzai insists that history is not likely to repeat itself - he cites the 'Afghan people' as the reason that Afghanistan will not succumb to radical Islam . 'We've seen this movie in Iraq,' McCain said. James . Dobbins, the State Department's special representative for Afghanistan . and Pakistan, countered that in Iraq 'people didn't want us and not a . single Iraqi politician was prepared to advocate our staying. In . Afghanistan, the people overwhelmingly want us to stay, and every . single contender in the presidential election said they would sign the . (bilateral security agreement).' Western . powers are counting on a peaceful transition in Kabul, but last . weekend's runoff vote has prompted allegations of election fraud. Candidates Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai hope to succeed . President Hamid Karzai, who was prevented from seeking a third term. At . the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee hearing, Sen. Dick . Durbin, D-Ill., wondered what the U.S. had learned from Iraq that could . be applied to Afghanistan and whether its forces could defend . themselves. Last month, Obama, left, announced that about 10,000 troops would stay in Afghanistan at the end of this year but be fully withdrawn by the end of 2016.  But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., right, predicted a reconstituted Taliban will threaten Afghanistan as the ISIS has done in Iraq . Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., expressed concern about a collapse in Afghanistan undercutting a nuclear-armed Pakistan. Dempsey said he was concerned about Afghanistan's future and said the U.S. military would continue to work on building a resilient Afghan force. 'But at the end of the day, a security force is only as good as the instrument that wields it, and that's the central government,' the general said. He added that Afghans are 'more tenacious fighters than their Iraqi counterparts.' The Afghanistan war has lasted more than a decade, cost billions of dollars and killed more than 2,100 members of the U.S. military. Obama has public sentiment on his side in taking steps to end the conflict, while a number of lawmakers are resistant to keeping U.S. troops in the country beyond 2016. 'I don't think we want to be the permanent occupiers of Afghanistan,' Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in an interview. 'At a certain point, with our help, it's up to the Afghan government to earn the support of its people. And if they can't do that, I don't want American troops simply to be there in harm's way with a recalcitrant government.' President Barack Obama meets with, from left, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nev., in the Oval Office of the White House to discuss Iraq .

The outgoing premier told the BBC: 'Not at all. Not all all. We are a united country.' Today's attack took place in the parking compound of a Nato base near the Torkham crossing on the Pakistani border, near the Khyber Pass and a main supply route for Nato-led forces in land-locked Afghanistan. Militants on both sides of the border have for years been attacking supplies bound for Nato-led forces in Afghanistan. Ahmad Zia Abdulzai, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said one attacker blew himself up while police killed the other three. He said 37 trucks containing fuel and other supplies were destroyed in explosions set off by the attackers. One Afghan driver was injured, a witness told Reuters. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid confirmed that the militants, fighting to expel foreign forces and bring down the U.S.-backed Kabul government, were behind the attack. Taliban fighters killed scores of people in attacks on Saturday on a second-round, run-off presidential election. Afghanistan's allies hope the election can usher in a strong, stable government but accusations of cheating have raised fears of a deadlock between the two rival candidates, both of whom support a security pact with the United States. The Taliban dismissed the vote as a U.S. ploy.","Fears the gains in Afghanistan could be wiped out by a resurgent Taliban .

"Australian supermodel Robyn Lawley has accused the modelling industry of setting impossible standards for women, and is refusing to be called 'plus size'. The 25-year-old beauty said that she has seen too many of her fellow models starving themselves to meet the industry's standards. ‘I’ve seen so many models starve themselves. It’s not up to them, they get told they have to, otherwise they’re fired.’ In an interview with Marie Claire, the 25-year-old beauty revealed the struggle to maintain her weight and the high expectations of the culture of fashion. ‘When I started modelling, I knew that half the models were about half the size I was’. ‘At first I was totally fine to be labelled as plus size, because I was getting work. But then I realised it was a tool for manipulation’. ‘My body is the national average.’ Scroll down for video . In an interview with Marie Claire, the 25-year-old beauty revealed the struggle to maintain her weight and the high expectations of the culture of fashion. Australian supermodel Robyn Lawley has accused the modelling industry of promoting starvation, calling the pressure to be thin 'messed up'. At 188cm, Lawley was introduced to the modelling world early on, pushed into auditioning for an agency by one of her three sisters. 'When I became a teenager... everyone started suggesting it because I was tall and that's what tall girls do, I suppose,' Lawley said . Lawley says that the pressure to be thin is 'messed up', revealing that it was hard for her to maintain the expected weight as she was playing sport competitively and enjoyed eating. ‘I’m a person that loves food,' said Lawley. 'It’s my favourite part of the day.’ 'I just see no reason in any labels really, I just want women [to be] happy with their bodies.' The Aussie beauty has recently launched a book called Robyn Lawley Eats, as a spin off of her blog of the same name, which features recipes and Lawley's food adventures. Lawley was signed last year to brand Mango to front their plus-size range Violetta, but is irritated that the modelling industry labels her and other 'plus sizers' as niche. 'People say, ""How is she a plus-size model?"" and I'm like, ""Exactly, this is the point, how am I a plus-size model?', Lawley told Clique Magazine. 'There's no size diversity - just none. So there's a whole no-man's land of models who are in between the 'straight size' and the 'plus-size' and they are not working, yet they've got these amazing bodies that are completely in proportion.' 'I don't think anyone should be called plus-size,' she adds. 'I think it's derogatory to anyone - it's a label. 'I just see no reason in any labels really, I just want women [to be] happy with their bodies,' Lawley said . Unwilling to compromise her health, Lawley quit the industry. It took her many years to realise she could model without harming her physical or emotional health. 'I'm a model; I don't think I need 'plus-size' in front of it.' At 188cm, Lawley was introduced to the modelling world early on, pushed into auditioning for an agency by one of her three sisters. 'When I became a teenager... everyone started suggesting it because I was tall and that's what tall girls do, I suppose,' she said. 'When you first consider the idea of modeling, you automatically think you have to be really skinny,' she said. 'I was really into fashion, so I knew models were about half the size I was. When I went to see the agencies, my weight was always an issue so I took it upon myself to start losing it.' After a few years, the size 12 model began to realise the detrimental effect the industry standards were having on not only her, but her friends. 'I had a moment when I was about 16, one of my Russian model friends was painfully thin and we went to a cafe after a casting. I was trying not to eat at the time, but I was really struggling,' Lawley said. 'I just got a salad [but] she didn't eat anything. I thought it was just so messed up. I was worried about her health.' Unwilling to compromise her health, Lawley quit the industry. It took her many years to realise she could model without harming her physical or emotional health. 'It was really hard to have that extra pressure to lose, not just a little amount of weight, but a lot. I had a lot of issues with it,' she said. '[Many models] get measured when they go into an agency, and if they gain weight, they are out. People don't understand what starvation can do to you, it wreaks havoc with your brain.' Lawley was the first 'plus size' model for Ralph Lauren, but isn't comfortable with the term, and is passionate about promoting healthy body image among young women. 'I can see the ramifications on young women if their body is similar or larger than mine and they see a 'plus size' label,’ she recently told Daily Mail Australia.

"Britain's Disasters Emergency Committee is launching an appeal over the Ebola crisis - the first time it has ever called for donations in response to a disease outbreak. The committee, made up of 13 of the UK's major aid charities, said it took the decision because the effects of the killer virus is threatening to become 'a humanitarian catastrophe'. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the government would match the first £5 million of donations from the public because the outbreak demands 'a huge global response'. The DEC described the spread of the disease, which has killed almost 5,000 people, as 'explosive' saying it is devastating communities, health services and people's ability to support themselves.

The UK's main broadcasters are due to screen the appeal tomorrow. DEC chief executive Saleh Saeed said: 'This appeal is completely unprecedented and that is a sign of just how serious the situation in West Africa has become.

"Asda has removed a 'rogue online offer' after customers discovered they could get a £50 discount on anything over £50. In a 'system glitch', hundreds of shoppers were able to buy luxury items such as electrical equipment, crates of alcohol, chocolate and DVDs for as little as 1p. All they had to worry about was the cost of delivery. However, hours later Asda bosses got wind of the blunder and texted the bargain-hunters to say their orders had been cancelled.

A spokesman said they will not honour the 'rogue' offer . It comes just weeks after the store was attacked for offering 'mental patient' Halloween costumes to their online shoppers. Today, the groceries giant faced criticism by announcing it will not honour the deal promoted last night. A spokesman said: 'We're aware of a glitch with our e-vouchering, and are in the process of addressing it. 'No-one has lost out as a result of it, but a small number of savvy customers have taken advantage and got more money off than they should have.

Others called BBC Radio 4 to complain. Nick Devine, 23, from Leeds, told the You & Yours programme he was sent the code by a friend. He said: 'I bought two-and-a-half litres of vodka and three bottles of mixer, checked out and it came to zero. 'I said I'd pick it up from Asda so I didn't have to pay the delivery costs, but I've woken up to a text message this morning to say it's been cancelled.'

Sash Nemphos, described as a 'shy and talented artist', was originally arrested on suspicion of a series of vehicle break-ins on York Road in Monkton, Baltimore County, last Saturday. But during a police interview, he allegedly revealed that he had explosive devices at his home and wanted to kill people at the George Washington Carver Center for Arts and Technology. He reportedly told officers he planned to carry out the shooting spree on Monday - in just two days' time - and had even practiced taking a handgun to the school, hidden inside his backpack. During a search of Nemphos's house in Monkton, Baltimore County Police apparently found three crude, homemade explosives, hazardous materials and a gun, according to the Baltimore Sun.

A force spokesman tweeted: 'Boy who was arrested after explosive devices and a gun found in his home Saturday is now charged as an adult.'

'It is recognized that every individual in the school is worth something, and is a person and is as important as anyone else in the community. No one is ever put down in the school.' Meanwhile, a woman who has lived across the street from Nemphos and his family for nearly 20 years described the suspect as a 'sweet and kind-hearted' boy who was a gifted artist. 'That's why this is difficult, because it's just kind of hitting everybody - it's just not expected. I just hope that whatever's happening, he's going to get what he needs,' Regina DeSantis told WBAL-TV. Stanley Dukes, an employee at the Monkton Grill near Nemphos's home, added: 'He's a little guy.

'At this point, nothing has been shared with us [from the school] to give us any indication that this could have happened,' said Maria Lowery. 'We had no reason to suspect we had an issue.' Parents of students at Carver - a premier arts school that is considered one of the top-performing insitutions in the country - were notified of the suspect's charges on Monday.

"Two 15-year-old boys have been praised for their survival skills after they found shelter and started a fire in subzero temperatures when their snowmobile became stuck in deep snow in the Maine wilderness. Ty Howard-Gotto and Jonah May, both from Rhode Island, took a wrong turn as they traveled 15 miles from Mexico, Maine, to Howard-Grotto's grandfather's home in Andover at 7.30pm on Monday. The duo accidentally headed down a trail that had not been cleared and their 2007 Arctic Cat Firecat snowmobile became stuck in deep snow, according to the Maine Warden Service. Stranded, the boys walked a short distance before discovering a shed with a golf cart inside and used the cart's gasoline to start a fire, WCSH reported. Survivors: Tyler Howard-Gotto, left, and Jonah May, right, sought out shelter and made a fire after they became stranded in snow in Maine while snowmobiling. This image shows them after they were found . As temperatures plunged below zero, they made sure to bundle up before sleeping inside the cart. 'I had my clothes bag with me,' Howard-Gotto told WCSH. 'I stuffed my T-shirts, whatever, underwear, as insulation and zipped it up.' The youngsters said they helped each other through the ordeal. 'I was a little scared,' May said. 'Started thinking about my mother and that stuff, but Ty kept me in line, told me we gotta make a fire and push through this.' Wardens began looking for the missing due early on Tuesday after Howard-Grotto's family alerted authorities. But their search was called off around 10am after a motorist came across the boys, who had started walking to look for help, and drove them to their grandfather's home. Stuck: The snowmobile, pictured, got stuck after they failed to take a turn. But luckily they found a shed and used gasoline from a golf cart to start a fire. They next day they flagged a motorist down for help . Both boys were hungry but otherwise healthy, and had no signs of hypothermia. Howard-Grotto said he believes his survival skills saved them. 'Anyone else in those woods that didn't have the set of mind and the skill set, they wouldn't have made it out there,' he told WCSH. Ty's mother, Tracy Howard, added: 'I'm quite impressed with those two kids.'","Ty Howard-Gotto and Jonah May took a wrong turn as they made their way to Ty's grandfather's home in Maine on Monday and became stranded .

"Admission: Michael Johnson, the nephew of Jimmy Savile, has revealed today he was sentenced to four years in custody in 1986 after admitting five counts of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl . The nephew of disgraced television star Jimmy Savile has today revealed that he is a convicted paedophile who abused a teenage girl. Michael Johnson was sentenced to four years in custody in 1986 after admitting five counts of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. The former nightclub owner today revealed that he had served two-and-a-half years of the  sentence and claimed he had been completely 'rehabilitated.' He also expressed his own 'self disgust and shame' at the crime. Mr Johnson, now aged 67 years, was among family members who decided to remove the headstone from the former Radio 1 star’s grave after the allegations of sex abuse came to light. In a family statement they said they were 'reeling' with shock about their uncle’s past. Today he said: 'As a member of Jimmy Savile’s family, I too shared . their feelings of disappointment and was appalled at the level of . allegations made toward him after his recent death. 'This . has been a burden for me and my own immediate family since that time . and have had to deal with the circumstances and devastating affects in . my social domestic and business life and notwithstanding the more . devastating affects on those that have been victims of Jimmy Savile. 'My . and my family burden now continues, in having to prepare this statement . which refers to my own past of nearly 30 years ago when I served a 2.5 . year sentence for a sexual offence against a 14 year old female. 'I cannot stress my own self-disgust and shame together with the huge sorrow I have for that person. 'Since . my release I have been properly rehabilitated and with my forgiving . family, have continued to live my life socially and from a business . perspective, to the best of my ability whilst attempting to draw an . underscore in that period of my life. 'I . sincerely hope that I am allowed to continue my life in peace in the . community and not have to face the traumas of the past anymore and the . family connection with Jimmy Savile which has devastated us, and those . who admired him, prior to the allegations of the past.'

Mr Johnson, now aged 67 years, was among family members who decided to remove the headstone from the former Radio 1 star's grave after the allegations of sex abuse came to light . Mr Johnson’s own wife claims she was kept . completely in the dark about her husband’s convictions until they became . embroiled in a custody battle. 'Social . services carried out an assessment and, to my horror, their report . revealed Michael had gone to prison in 1986, before I knew him, for . sexual offences against a child,' said 54-year-old Karen Davison, who . lives in Loughton, near Milton Keynes, Bucks. She said that she had visited 'Uncle Jimmy' with her husband a number of times during their marriage. 'Uncle Jimmy always gave me the creeps. 'Once he kept asking me to sit on his knee and he was grabbing me. It was disgusting.' Mr Johnson is a director of city property company. He once ran the Talk of the Town nightclub in The Point in Milton Keynes. Ms Davison said she met Mr Johnson in 1995 and that he actively pursued her while still married to another woman. They married in 2004 before separating just two years later after Mr Johnson walked out in 2006. She claimed she only learned of her former husband’s history of sexual offending after their relationship had ended. As a result she called social services who carried out an assessment on her former partner and this later concluded that he was a low risk.

"A navy SEAL who was shot 27 times by Al Qaeda has shared the story of his miraculous survival as he fought to defeat four terrorists and get back home to his wife and daughters. Mike Day was serving  in Iraq’s Anbar Province in April 2007 when he came face-to-face with four heavily armed Al Qaeda leaders inside a 12 x 12 foot room while searching for a high-level terrorist cell. Despite being shot 27 times at close range, Day was able to fight off the men, clear the rest of the house and walk under his own power to a medevac helicopter. Scroll down for video . Mike Day was serving in Iraq’s Anbar Province in April 2007 when he came face-to-face with four heavily armed Al Qaeda leaders inside a 12 x 12 foot room while searching for a high-level terrorist cell . He told Fox News that he opened the door on the night of April 6 and the terrorists beat him to the trigger, shooting his rifle out of his hands and hitting him 16 times in the arms, legs and abdomen. The remaining eleven shots hit his body armour, which amazingly absorbed multiple strikes despite not being designed to withstand that level of force. After the first round, the body armour he was wearing is expected to deteriorate and fall apart. 'Anywhere you can put your finger on me, I was shot, except for my head,' he said. 'And here I am today, to tell the story. 'I was there, and I don't believe it.' He said that once he realized he was actually being shot, he 'asked God to get me home to my girls,' which he noted was the first time he had ever said a real prayer. The navy SEAL then used his pistol and muscle memory to  fight his way out of the room. He said: 'I just did what I was trained to do.' The navy SEAL plans to compete in the Ironman 70.3 triathlon in Florida to raise funds for the care and treatment of wounded warriors and dependent children who have suffered severe brain injuries . Mike Day said that once he realized he was actually being shot, he 'asked God to get me home to my girls,' which he noted was the first time he had ever said a real prayer . Day revealed that another navy SEAL died that night from just a single gunshot wound. After spending two years recovering in hospital, Day is devoting himself to raising funds for the Brain Treatment Center through Mike Day's Tri Challenge. He will compete in the Ironman 70.3 triathlon in Florida to raise funds for the care and treatment of wounded warriors and dependent children who have suffered severe brain injuries. The funds will provide customized treatment programs to individuals at the Carrick Brain Treatment Center, a non-profit organization in Texas. He has already raised more than $33,000 on his CrowdRise page but hopes that the figure will rise to at least $75,000. 'My life's mission now not about me,' Day added. 'Rather, it is to care for and lead my wounded brothers and sisters. My fellow warriors deserve the best available treatment for their injuries.'","Mike Day was serving in Iraq when he came face-to-face with four terrorists .

"Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey, whose letter revealed the truth about the turbines . A least 1,000 more onshore wind turbines will be built than are needed to meet Whitehall energy targets, according to official estimates. Britain will exceed the capacity needed to meet EU renewable energy targets by 15 per cent and all projects in the planning system are surplus to requirements, it is claimed. The details are revealed in a letter from Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey to Labour MP Mary Creagh. The figures show the country is on course to have onshore wind farms with a capacity of more than 15 gigawatts, compared with the 11 to 13 gigawatts Mr Davey says is needed by 2020 to meet EU targets. The figures appear to back Tory claims there is no need for any more wind farms, amid concern from MPs that turbines blight the countryside. The party has vowed to cap the number of onshore wind farms by ending subsidies for those that have not yet been approved if it wins the next year’s election. According to the Sunday Telegraph, the letter by Mr Davey says that 7.8 gigawatts of onshore wind capacity has been built and 1.5 gigawatts is under construction. There is a further 5.3 gigawatts with planning consent and 6.4 gigawatts applying for consent. Scroll down for video . Mr Davey says ‘not everything in planning will get planning consent and not everything that is consented will be built’. But he adds: ‘On average, our models assume that around 50 per cent of projects in the planning system receive consent and around 70 per cent of consented projects are built.’ If seven out of ten approved projects are built, none of the 6.4 gigawatts still in the planning system would be needed to meet the targets. A least 1,000 more onshore wind turbines will be built than are needed to meet Whitehall energy targets . And if planned projects are approved and built at the predicted rate, the UK would exceed the upper range of targets by 1,000 turbines (2.2 gigawatts). The Renewable Energy Foundation, a group critical of subsidy costs, has called for the Government to stop supporting planned onshore wind turbines and focus on other areas. A spokesman said: ‘The presence of this needless 6.4 gigawatts of onshore wind in the planning system is causing undue cost to local authorities and widespread planning blight to affected communities.’ A fracking company has been accused of offering people bribes of 6 per cent of its profits for letting it drill under their homes. Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of chemicals firm Ineos, said the offer meant landowners and communities could get £2.5billion over the next two decades. Landowners would get 4 per cent of the profit from fracking – in which natural gas is extracted from underground rock by blasting it with water, sand and chemicals – while 2 per cent was for local projects such as parks. Announcing the offer, Mr Ratcliffe claimed: ‘It means the rewards are fairly shared by everyone.’ But Simon Clydesdale, of Greenpeace, said it was a bribe, adding: ‘People have legitimate concerns that won’t be easily assuaged by cash sweeteners.’","A least 1,000  will be built than needed to meet Whitehall energy targets .

"The Islamic State's 'emir of suicide bombers'  raised a staggering $2million for 'military operations' from a mystery Qatari donor, U.S. officials have said. Tunisian-born Tariq bin al-Tahar al-Harzi, 32, one of the terror group's most senior commanders, allegedly arranged to receive the funds from a Gulf-based 'financial facilitator'. The unnamed donor told him the cash must be used for 'military operations' and also enlisted the terrorist's help with 'fundraising efforts in Qatar', according to the U.S. Treasury. The revelations have sparked calls for the Gulf state, the richest per capita in the world, to prevent its citizens from aiding the flow of funds to Syria-based terror groups, such as ISIS. Scroll down for video . Terrorist: Tunisian-born Tariq bin al-Tahar al-Harzi (pictured), 32, the Islamic State's 'emir of suicide bombers', has raised a staggering $2million for 'military operations' from a mystery Qatari donor, say U.S. officials . Calls for action: The revelations have sparked calls for the Gulf state, the richest per capita in the world, to prevent its citizens from aiding the flow of funds to terror groups like ISIS. Above, Qatar's capital, Doha . But despite increasing criticism, Qatar, which has an extensive London property portfolio including luxury department store Harrods, is now 'working together' with the U.S. against ISIS. The Gulf has contributed two Mirage jet fighters to President Barack Obama's air campaign against militants, which are being controlled from a headquarters outside Qatar’s capital, Doha. Al-Harzi, who is believed to be one of ISIS's first ever terrorists, is among a number of jihadists to be recently added to the Treasury's list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists. Other named jihadists include a middleman between al-Qaeda’s leadership in Pakistan and Gulf financiers and another ISIS senior commander who is believed to oversee a prison where foreign hostages are held. Accused: Tarkhan Batirashvili (left) allegedly oversaw an ISIS prison facility in al-Tabqa, close to al-Raqqah, where foreign hostages were held, while Amru al-Absi (right) is reportedly the group's 'kidnapper-in-chief;' Militants: Al-Harzi,  believed to be one of ISIS's first ever terrorists, is among 11 jihadists and one terrorist group newly added to the Treasury's list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists. Above, ISIS militants in Syria . In addition to 'raising funds', Al-Harzi allegedly serves as ISIS's 'emir' of the border region between Turkey and Syria and works to 'recruit and facilitate the travel of fighters' for the terror group. In this capacity, he has reportedly received 'new foreign fighter recruits and provided them light weapons training before sending them to Syria'. He has also 'facilitated the movement of Europeans to Turkey' (including fighters from the UK, Albania and Denmark), organised suicide attacks in Iraq and helped ISIS to develop its fighters' abilities to build car bombs and improvised explosive devices, the Treasury said. British MP Stephen Barclay said the allegations against al-Harzi's - in particular, the $2million he has reportedly raised - underlined the need for Qatar to 'clamp down' on the flow of money to ISIS. Property portfolio: Despite the calls for action, Qatar, which has an extensive London property portfolio including Harrods (pictured), is now 'working together' with the U.S. against ISIS (also known as ISIL or IS) 'These further revelations underline the need for Qatar to demonstrate clearly its commitment to clamping down on the clear flow of money that has helped to facilitate the grip of Isil,' the Conservative MP told The Telegraph, using another name for the group. 'Specifically, there needs to be action against those who have been complicit or directly involved in delivering this funding.' Daniel Byman, of the Brookings Institute, added that the country had 'not put significant barriers in the way' of such monetary transfers. 'A lot of people believe the government has, in fact, allowed it to happen,' he said. Among the other jihadists named as 'global terrorists' by the Treasury was Tarkhan Batirashvili, who has reportedly held a number of top military positions within ISIS. Known as 'Omar the Chechen', Batirashvili allegedly oversees an ISIS prison facility in al-Tabqa, close to al-Raqqah, where foreign hostages may be held. In late 2013, he led around 1,000 foreign fighters to attack the Syrian regime at Jabal Shuwayhnah in Rif Aleppo, Syria, said the Treasury. Abd al-Aziz al-Fadhill, a Kuwait-based facilitator who allegedly provides support to al-Nusra Front, was also named in the Treasury's list, released on Wednesday. He has reportedly co-ordinated the transfer of 'hundreds of thousands of dollars' to the terrorist group, as well as facilitating travel for individuals seeking to join it. President: The Gulf has contributed two Mirage jet fighters to President Barack Obama's (pictured) air campaign against militants, which are being controlled from a headquarters outside Qatar’s capital, Doha . Meanwhile, Ibrahim al-Bakr, 37, has been listed as a key link between al-Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan and financiers in the Gulf. He is 'responsible for collecting money for both al-Qaida and the Taliban', as well as playing a 'key role in a terrorist cell that was plotting to attack U.S. military bases and personnel in Qatar'. Other jihadists named by the Treasury include Ashraf al-Salam, Umar al-Qatari, Fatih Hasar, Hamad al-Shammari, and Bambang Sukirno, as well as the terrorist group Hilal Indonesia. It comes as the British Parliament has voted to approve the UK's participation in U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS. Prime Minister: It comes as the British Parliament has voted to participate in U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS. David Cameron (pictured) told members of Parliament that the group was plotting terrorist attacks in Britain . Six RAF Tornados were expected to join US, French and Arab air strikes – their first in Iraq for six years – today after MPs voted overwhelmingly to go into a third Gulf War. Warning that the fight to crush IS could last for years, not months, David Cameron told an emergency session of Parliament that as well as murdering Western hostages with ‘staggering brutality’ the group was plotting terrorist attacks in Britain. ‘This is about psychopathic terrorists trying to kill us,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘We do have to realise that whether we like it or not, they have already declared war on us.’ MPs authorised military action by 524 votes to 43, one of the biggest Commons majorities since the last general election.","Tariq bin al-Tahar al-Harzi, 32, is 'one of ISIS's most senior commanders'

"Hundreds of British Muslims have travelled to Iraq to fight for the extreme jihadist group ISIS, terror experts have said. The Government believes more than 500 British citizens have left the UK and gone to join rebel fighters in Syria, with many of them feared to have crossed the border to join the uprising in Iraq. The ruthless ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) extremists control large areas of land in Syria and are now turning their attention to Iraq and particularly Baghdad, having already taken the cities of Mosul and Tikrit. Meanwhile, British security experts are also looking at the possibility that home-grown extremists trained by the ultra-violent group may bring terror back to the UK. Scroll down for video . Britons are leaving the UK to fight with the ultra-violent ISIS group in Syria and Iraq, it was claimed today . Bloodshed in Iraq: This video grab shows violence on the road to Baghdad as ISIS marched south today . Carnage: Isis fighters, who took Mosul, pictured, earlier this week, are known for their violence and ruthlessness . One terror expert told MailOnline today: 'There is a fairly high chance that someone will attempt it.' More than 500 British Muslims are believed to have already travelled to Syria to fight against President Assad, and it is feared many more will join them.  Many of them are now feared to have crossed the barely-existent border into Iraq with the ultra-violent ISIS militia. Charlie Cooper, researcher at the anti-extremist think tank, Quilliam Foundation, said: 'People are going from Britain and the EU . to fight for ISIS - the estimate is more than 500 and that number will . probably rise. 'If you want to go and fight jihad, ISIS, which holds a particularly extreme view of Islam and wants to create an extreme Islamic utopia, is a very . attractive group to fight for.' He added: 'Britons are going from Syria into Iraq because of this utopian promise.  It is the only group in the world that has come close to establishing its version of an Islamic state, which is a big thing for people - including the British - who feel drawn to this kind of Islamic extremism. 'People who are starting to go out to . Syria from Britain will see the huge gains that ISIS has made in Iraq in the last few days and they will . be keen to join them because they see the potential.' ISIS is cash rich, having looted hundreds of millions of dollars from the Mosul Central Bank when it took Iraq's second city earlier this week, and is helped as a force by its terrifying reputation. Attractive to extremists: ISIS fighters preach an extreme form of Islam and want to create an Islamic utopia . Terror: Footage reportedly taken by ISIS shows Islamist fighters randomly shooting pedestrians and motorists . Mr Cooper said: 'They took Mosul with 800 soldiers - against a reported 30,000 Iraqi soldiers.  Their reputation precedes them.' He said he believed the next week was crucial in establishing what ISIS' aims were, with the possibility that the group may try to secure its position in Iraq and stage a tactical retreat from Syria, or vice versa. Today ISIS continued its march south towards Baghdad, shooting civilians alongside Iraqi soldiers, according to the UN.  A video purportedly taken by ISIS militants emerged this morning showing gunmen carrying out indiscriminate drive-by shootings. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it was . 'very concerned' with the escalating violence and was 'not going to take its . eye off the ball'. Mr Cooper warned that once the ISIS position was secure, there was a danger they may look to the west, with the possibility of British-grown, ISIS-trained extremists bringing their terror tactics back home. He said: 'It's estimated that one in nine jihadists return home from jihad wanting to try to commit terror offences at home, and I would argue that they would look to the west. 'In ISIS they fight in battalions organised by nationality, the French together, the Belgians together, and so on, which is a clever tactic as it means when they return home they have an organised network of people to coordinate. 'I think what's happening out there is really, really worrying.' Territory so far : The map shows the areas of Iraq and Syria currently controlled by ruthless ISIS forces . David Cameron's official spokesman acknowledged fears British citizens could be among the ISIS fighters in Iraq, saying: 'Our security services and all the relevant agencies will be monitoring those types of risks very closely. 'Clearly there is a very porous border between parts of Syria and parts of Iraq. 'As the Prime Minister has said, the greatest extremist activity and jihadist threats to the international community are in Syria. 'We need to keep these things under very close watch.' Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said: 'The police and security services are working to detect and disrupt terrorist threats from Syria and will take the strongest possible action to protect our national security. 'The Serious Crime Bill would extend the reach of the Terrorism Act 2006 so that UK-linked individuals and those who seek to harm UK interests, who travel overseas to prepare or train more generally for terrorism, can be prosecuted as if their actions had taken place in the UK. 'Syria is a dangerous place and the UK advises against all travel to the country. Even people travelling for well-intentioned humanitarian reasons are exposing themselves to serious risk, including being targeted for recruitment by terrorist groups. The best way to help Syrian people is by donating to UK-registered charities.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Even people travelling for well-intentioned humanitarian reasons are exposing themselves to serious risk, including being targeted for recruitment by terrorist groups. 'The police and security services are actively working to detect and disrupt any terrorist threat from Syria and individuals who travel there. 'People who are thinking about travelling to Syria to engage in terrorist activity should be in no doubt that we will take the strongest possible action to protect our national security, including prosecuting those who break the law.' Mr Cameron has spoken to the secretary general of Nato about the security situation in Iraq, Downing Street said today, stressing that Mr Cameron's conversation with Anders Fogh Rasmussen did not relate to any possible Nato deployment of military resources. ISIS flag: Khawaja is accused of attending a training camp linked to ISIS . A British Muslim reported to have been killed in Syria appeared in a London court today charged with training to be a terrorist with an extremist Islamic group linked to ISIS. Imran Khawaja, 26, of Southall, west London, who is accused of spending up to six months training with ISIS, appeared in court alongside his cousin, Tahir Bhatti, 44. Bespectacled Bhatti, of Watford, Hertfordshire, is accused of driving to Bulgaria to colleck Khawaja, helping him buy an AK47 assault rifle, and other offences relating to aiding or abetting the alleged terrorist. Khawaja, who was thought to have been killed in action when the terrorist group Rayat al Tawheed announced his death last week, appeared before Westminster Magistrates' Court today. He was accused of attending a Syrian terrorist training camp run by Rayat al Tawheed, and of buying return tickets to Kurdistan, from where he is believed to have entered the war zone, on a compromised credit card.

"Parents have accused an inner-city headteacher of turning a blind eye towards violent gangs of Roma pupils for fear of being labelled a racist. More than 1,600 people have signed an online petition claiming ‘children have been stabbed, mugged and nearly kicked to death’ at the school. It urges the head not to ‘be afraid’ to tackle the issue – and suggests he is failing to do so for fear of appearing racist because the majority of the perpetrators are of Slovakian Roma origin. Scroll down for video . Attack: Three boys believed to be of Roma Slovak descent have been expelled from a Sheffield school after an attack on Rhys Larkin, left and right, who needed hospital treatment . Defence: Hinde House School says it has dealt with the incident swiftly and takes safety of students seriously . Referring to the child-abuse scandal involving Asian taxi drivers in Rotherham, the petition says: ‘We have all seen what happens when those in authority turn a blind eye for fear of being labelled racist from what has been happening in Rotherham and throughout the country. 'It is not good enough to pretend that the school is running smoothly when our children are coming home in fear having being intimidated by gangs or indeed having been assaulted. ‘Children have been stabbed, mugged and nearly kicked to death in his school in which he claims everything is ok and we have had enough.’ Parents passed the petition to Mr French through the bars of the school gate today, and were due to meet with him this afternoon, but said the group meeting had been cancelled. The petition was launched after an attack last Thursday that left pupil Rhys Larkings, 14, battered and bruised with a broken nose after being allegedly punched to the ground by three Roma Slovak teenagers. Police have arrested two 15-year-old boys on suspicion of assault and public order offences, and the pair have been bailed pending further inquiries. Officers are still looking for a third boy, who has yet to be questioned. Rhys's mother Lorraine Larkings, 46, said parents are now being invited to smaller meetings for each year group, saying the school had wanted to 'avoid trouble' by having 'too many people' turn up at once. Angry parents claim the head of Hinde House School in Sheffield has shown too much tolerance towards the Roma group blamed for a ‘gang-like culture’. Response: Rhys' mother Lorraine has launched a petition now signed by 1,500 demanding his school tackle tensions she blames on Slovakian pupils . There are around 1,200 children aged three to 16 at the school and up to 200 from the large local Roma Slovak community. More than 38 per cent of pupils do not have English as a first language. Rhys said he was beaten after being falsely accused of kicking a ball at a Slovakian child. His mother Lorraine Larkings, 46, said: ‘I’m upset and disgusted. You send your children to school to be educated not to be assaulted. ‘Something needs to be done about this and quickly.’ Parents were due to stage a protest march after the meetings earlier today. Mrs Larkings said she had been 'absolutely thrilled' by the support she received from other parents following the attack on her son. 'People are telling me they are not prepared to allow their children to be attacked and abused in this way,' she said. 'The hope is that if a decision is made to permanently exclude the offenders then things may calm down. But at the moment feelings are running high.' She added that Rhys had to be taken to hospital after the attack to have stitches, and said he is currently recovering from a broken nose and cuts to his ear and eyes at home. Mrs Larkings said she would be keeping Rhys at home until the problem had been resolved. A boy of 13 also suffered a serious assault at the school in September last year. The teenager walked away from a ‘minor altercation’ with a Roma boy, only to be ‘pushed down a flight of stairs and assaulted’ by three pupils moments later. His 46-year-old mother, who wants to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, said he suffered a swollen eye and was badly shaken. The three boys responsible were said to have remained at the school after being given a caution by police. The mother said she was not racist but simply concerned about the safety of the school. ‘There have always been many different ethnic minorities at the school but we have never had anything like this before,’ she said. Tension: Last year MP David Blunkett said his Sheffield constituents were 'on the edge of an explosion of feeling' because of tension with the Roma community in the city, pictured here after a street brawl . ‘There is real anger. Parents have decided enough is enough. The school has been playing the problem right down.’ Two weeks ago a 13-year-old pupil was left with cuts and bruises after being ‘tripped and punched’ outside the school by two Roma Slovak youths who were not pupils. The main attacker was quickly identified, but police told the victim’s family he’d returned to Slovakia so no action would be taken. His mother said: ‘I feel on edge sending my son to school. If pupils are being attacked at school it’s scary.’ Headteacher Chris French said: ‘Tensions between a small number of children in year ten have been apparent at school for a couple of weeks but staff have been working with students, staff and the wider community to resolve these.’ He added in a letter to parents: 'This was clearly a serious incident, but was dealt with swiftly and school returned to calm quickly. We are currently investigating this seriously so that we can take appropriate action including permanent exclusions if necessary. 'Tension between small numbers of children in Year 10 has been apparent for the last few weeks. Staff had been dealing with this day to day.

"A conservative Republican congressman released a bumper sticker that infuriated his opponents by connecting the debate over abortion with that of gun control. Campaign staffers working on the re-election team for Texas Congressman Steve Stockman released the bumper sticker today prompting an immediate backlash. 'If babies had guns they wouldn't be aborted. Vote Pro-Life!' the bumper sticker read. Fire starter: The bumper sticker was released via Twitter by the Congressman's campaign staff . Right wing: Congressman Stockman, who invited rocker Ted Nugent as his guest to the State of the Union, sells himself as the most conservative member of Congress, though he has not been ranked as such . The slogan was deemed 'outrageous' by the masses on Twitter, many of whom stopped to think about the physical impossibilities implied, but few missed the political implications. The statement is obviously intended to prompt outrage from critics and serve as a rallying cry from supporters, but a day after posting it to his Twitter feed, it apparently helped fund his campaign war chest for his 2014 re-election bid. His campaign managers are trying to position him on the far right of the party, appointing him the 'most conservative Congressman in Texas!' in his Twitter bio. The bio goes on to boast of his '100% lifetime NRA, GOA, NAGR, Right to Life rating'. Newsworthy: Stockman connected the bumper sticker to the ongoing trial of an abortion doctor who allegedly killed live babies and at least one mother in Philadelphia . Support: Stockman received campaign funds from pro-life and anti-gun control groups . In spite of his own assertions, he is not listed among the top 16 most conservative congressman by the National Journal in their annual rankings. Though the bumper sticker was released by his campaign staff and not by the Congressman himself, he found a way to make the move timely by tying it into the case against abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell in Pennsylvania who allegedly murdered seven babies in his 'house of horrors' clinic. 'Funny how all it takes is a bumper sticker for Democrats to finally start talking about the unborn like they're people. Hypocrisy exposed,' the Congressman tweeted Friday afternoon. His strong allegiance to pro-life and anti-gun control groups comes as little surprise when looking at his campaign finance reports. In the 2012 election, the National Association for Gun Rights, Gun Owners of America, and the National Pro-Life Alliance were among his top 20 donors. Stockman represents a district of southeast Texas that was created as a result of the 2010 census, so he is the first to serve as its representative. He previously served as a congressman from 1995 to 1997.","Campaign staff of Texas Congressman Steve Stockman selling the bumper stickers to raise money for his 2014 re-election bid .

"A father who had separated from his wife was yesterday suspected of starting a fire that killed him and his nine-year-old son. Darren Sykes and his two children were discovered by firemen as flames engulfed their semi-detached home. Nothing could be done to revive the 44-year-old and his youngest son Paul. Nine-year-old Paul Sykes and his father Darren (pictured) died in a fire at their home, while 12-year-old Jack (right) survived but remains in a critical condition in hospital . Twelve-year-old Jack survived the blaze but was said to be in a critical condition in hospital. His mother Claire Sykes, 42, was at his bedside yesterday. Detectives probing the tragedy said evidence pointed to the fire ‘being started deliberately’ and were treating it as ‘suspicious’. However police stressed they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the inquiry. Neighbours said flames suddenly swept through the house in Penistone, South Yorkshire, at around 6.30pm on Wednesday. The boys were staying with their carpet salesman father, and firemen found all three occupants on the first floor after they entered the building wearing breathing apparatus. Police revealed they were not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident which they described as 'suspicious' Flowers were attached to nine-year-old Paul's school gates with the message: 'You will be sadly missed' Neighbours added that they heard no screams or cries for help from inside. Post mortem examinations are due to be carried out today, but police said the victims’ injuries were ‘consistent with being involved in a fire’. Barrie Hall, 73, a retired security officer, said he was returning from a nearby park when he saw ‘acrid smoke coming out of the house’. He said the ‘fire brigade came and started sorting it out’ and police told local residents to go inside. ‘We didn’t know until later that anybody was in there,’ he added. ‘It was a shock. It’s terrible. It just blows you away.’ Mr Hall said the family had lived there together until the boys left with their mother at some point in the past few months. ‘Mr Sykes lived there on his own, I believe they were separated,’ he said, adding that Mr Sykes adored his children. ‘He loved his kids. You’d hear him playing with them all the time. I would say was he was a bigger kid than his kids.’ People arrived at the scene in Penistone in South Yorkshire to leave flowers for Darren and Paul Sykes yesterday . Police officers had cordoned off the quiet cul-de-sac yesterday morning as an investigation into the fire was launched . Neighbour Alan Shaw was returning from walking his dog when he saw ‘smoke everywhere’. He said: ‘I thought it was coming from a garage and then I realised the house was on fire. It was a big fire and soon fire engines turned up. It’s unbelievable.’ He added that the family had had a ‘domestic problem’ recently. Andy Platt, headmaster at Springvale Primary School, paid tribute to the nine-year-old victim, describing him as ‘an outgoing, popular boy’ who ‘will be greatly missed’. His brother Jack is said to be suffering from ‘life-threatening injuries’, although no further details have been released. Relatives were too upset to comment yesterday. Chief Inspector Debbie Mahmood, of South Yorkshire Police, said inquiries were under way but were at ‘a very early stage’. She added that her thoughts were with the family.

"When Alison Morales found out her three-day-old son Ryan had severe haemophilia, all she could think about was how much pain she watched her father go through when she was growing up. Mrs Morales, from Quakers Hill in Western Sydney, always knew there was a risk she would pass on the rare and incurable bleeding disorder to her children because her dad suffered from it his whole life. But the 37-year-old couldn't help but burst into tears when she thought about what it would mean for her baby. Scroll down for video . Ryan Morales and his grandfather Gerard Carson, who died in 2009 aged 64, both suffered from haemophilia . Ryan has learned how to administer his own injections to help him cope with the rare bleeding disorder and is now a fit and active 10-year-old who loves to be outdoors . 'All I could think of and see was my dad, who was 60 at the time, riddled with arthritis,' Mrs Morales told Daily Mail Australia. 'You can see in photos he just looks frail, he still had a good life and he had a wife and kids but he did suffer a lot of pain. 'When I found out with Ryan I thought it would be the same thing, that I've brought this baby into the world and he's not going to be able to play sport and he'll have all this trouble.' Because her father - who died in 2009 at the age of 64 - had haemophilia, Mrs Morales is a carrier and her children have a 50-50 chance of suffering from the disorder. Almost all people with haemophilia - including about 2800 Australians - are male. Men with haemophilia transmit the gene to their daughters, but not their sons.

Alison Morales (second from left) is a carrier of the disorder because her father had it. Her youngest son James (third from left) doesn't have it but her 12-year-old daughter Lara (third from right) may carry the gene . Women who carry the gene may transmit the gene to their son, who will have haemophilia, or their daughter who can also carry the gene. Ryan, now 10, and Mrs Morales' two-year-old son Thomas both have haemophilia, but her five-month-son James doesn't. Her 12-year-old daughter Lara doesn't suffer from the disorder but they have yet to test whether she is a carrier. Mrs Morales says Ryan is, thankfully, able to do most things boys his age can do. Treatment has advanced greatly since the days of her childhood and Ryan is able to receive a factor VIII injection – which adds a protein that helps the blood to clot – every two days. 'He's a sporty, active kid and he loves to be outside,' Mrs Morales said. Ryan has recently learnt how to do the factor VIII injection himself – something that has proven very helpful when trying to teach Thomas (pictured) about his own injections . Mrs Morales' father Gerard and mother Jan Carson . 'He's energetic, he plays soccer, he plays tennis, he does triathlons, likes riding his bike, riding his scooter, jumping on the trampoline. 'Thankfully there is this factor replacement, he would be tearing his hair out if he wasn't able to do those things.' But there are still risks. It is a myth that he could bleed to death from a tiny cut, but if Ryan were to have a big fall he would suffer immensely from internal bleeding. 'When they cut themselves or fall over and things that type of bleeding isn't a concern,' Mrs Morales said. 'The problem for severe haemophiliacs is the bleeding on the inside of your body. The Morales children. Almost all people with haemophilia - including about 2800 Australians - are male. Men with haemophilia transmit the gene to their daughters, but not their sons . Ryan is a sporty, active kid who loves to be outside and play sports like soccer and tennis . 'The biggest fear is any head bleeding, with a bad fall they could have bleeding on the brain which could cause a world of problems and could potentially be fatal.' At 10 years old Ryan already suffers from arthritis in his ankle because it has had so many internal bleeds at that spot. Ryan has recently learnt how to do the factor VIII injection himself – something that has proven very helpful when trying to teach Thomas about his own injections. 'Even for Ryan, Ryan grew up seeing my dad have to have factor sometimes, and we would say ""You can be brave like Poppy"",' she said. 'Now that's the same for Thomas, we say ""Ryan's having his factor, Ryan's brave, he doesn't cry"". After winning a competition at the Children's Hospital at Westmead he is starring as the lead character in a new comic book aimed at helping kids better understand the disorder . 'As much as you don't want to have two sons have haemophilia in some ways it's nice they can go through it together.' But his little brother isn't the only haemophilia sufferer Ryan is set to help. After winning a competition at the Children's Hospital at Westmead he is starring as the lead character in a new comic book aimed at helping kids better understand the disorder. 'He loves it, he was so excited,' she said. 'He took it straight to school to show his friends and teachers. 'Which is nice because he would never have so much to smile about in terms of his haemophilia otherwise.'

"This is the man named as an alleged serial child abuser 13 years ago by victims of the Rotherham grooming scandal. Yet despite being accused of vile crimes by 18 young girls, Arshid Hussain was never questioned by police. Now, though, officers are investigating Hussain, who these days is confined to a wheelchair following a shooting. Scroll down for video . Named: 18 girls allegedly named Arshid Hussain as their 'boyfriend' in interviews with social workers in 2001 . The girls, some as young as 12, all allegedly named him as their ‘boyfriend’ in interviews with council workers in 2001. But Hussain was not questioned about the allegations and police are only investigating the 39-year-old father in the wake of last week’s report into the Rotherham scandal by Professor Alexis Jay. Yesterday one alleged victim said it was ‘unbelievable’ young girls had not been protected. Katie – not her real name – got into a relationship with the violent man she knew as ‘Big Ash’ when she was 14 and he was 24. She claimed he was controlling and aggressive but police dismissed her concerns and those of her parents. They did not question him even after she made an official statement. She said: ‘I just think it is disgraceful. It wasn’t just me, there were so many of us and nothing was ever done.’ For two years she believed she was in love with Hussain, who had been married twice by the time she met him. Her parents did everything they could to stop the relationship. They even put her into care in a bid to separate them – but carers openly allowed him to see her and she twice became pregnant by him. She went to police aged 16 after realising she ‘couldn’t take’ any more, but said she was treated with derision. Victim: Katie (left), not her real name, thought she was in love with 'Big Ash' (right) when she was just 14 . On one occasion, she claimed, she called police saying she was scared because Hussain was sat outside her house in his car but was told because she lived on a main road he was allowed to be there. Katie said: ‘He should have been arrested and questioned and taken to court. To not even question him is just unbelievable.’ The former deputy leader of Rotherham Council, Jahangir Akhtar, is a cousin of Hussain and lives a few doors from his family home. Mr Akhtar was accused in a report in The Times last year of helping to arrange a deal where Hussain returned one of his young alleged victims who had gone missing from home to police. Crime tsar Shaun Wright defiantly repeated his refusal to quit yesterday in the wake of the Rotherham grooming scandal. The South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner insisted he will complete his term of office – but announced that he will not seek re-election to the £85,000-a-year post in 2016. Mr Wright, Rotherham Council cabinet member for children’s services between 2005 and 2010, apologised again for his role in the ‘systematic failure’ which allowed the scandal to go undetected for so long, adding: ‘I wish I knew then what I do now.’ The 46-year-old has faced calls to step down from David Cameron, Theresa May and the Labour Party, and faces questioning by the Commons home affairs select committee over the scandal in the next few days. He had refused interviews in the days after Professor Jay’s damning report but broke his silence to tell the Mail: ‘If I stepped down now, it would take two months to elect a successor and a by-election will cost £1.5million. ‘Somebody will be elected without the knowledge I have. I came into public life to make a difference and I am still in a position where I can make that difference. 'I genuinely think I am the best person to take this forward. When I took over, there were just two or three officers working on child sexual exploitation. There are now 50.’ Mr Akhtar has denied protecting Hussain or knowing about any inappropriate relationships. Hussain was named as a ‘boyfriend’ by up to 18 girls who spoke to social workers as part of the Risky Business outreach group, aimed at youngsters who were at risk of being lured into prostitution. The council-funded project, which has since been absorbed into the council’s safeguarding team, allegedly passed his name to police in 2001. Professor Jay’s report said Risky Business was often the only agency to take victims seriously but was ‘too often seen as something of a nuisance, particularly by children’s social care’. Hussain was shot in the stomach in 2005 and now uses a wheelchair. He and his wife Fatima moved to a council bungalow near Goole, East Yorkshire, around a year ago. Hussain refused to speak to the Mail and his solicitor Riyaz Shaikh did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the allegations. South Yorkshire Police said: ‘A number of investigations looking at historical sexual offences in Rotherham are currently ongoing. ‘These are large-scale investigations and are very much live and dynamic. We would be compromising those investigations if we were to provide any details at this stage.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","18 girls allegedly named Arshid Hussain, 39, as their 'boyfriend' in 2001 .

"A Pittsburgh man was 'screaming in pain' after he set himself on fire  while drinking moonshine and trying to light a furnace in his basement, according to police. The man, who has not been named by authorities, was standing outside his North Side home when fire crews arrived at at 2:45 a.m. Tuesday. Neighbors identified the man only as 'Tony' and said that he was screaming in pain because his legs had been burned so badly. Scene: The unnamed man was standing outside his North Side home, pictured here, when fire crews arrived . Moonshine: The man admitted that he was making the booze in his house . The neighbors said they knew the 30-year-old through family and that he was highly intoxicated. Pittsburgh Police Spokeswoman Sonya Toler said: 'He told a neighbor that he started the fire when he was drinking moonshine and trying to light his furnace.' Firefighters worked quickly to extinguish the small blaze and the man later admitted that he had been making the illegal booze in his house. The man is being treated at UPMC Mercy hospital's burn unit for third-degree burns to his legs. UPMC Mercy is a main hospital facility of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center located in the Uptown section of the city of Pittsburgh. Arson Investigators are still looking into the exact cause of the fire. But no charges are expected to be filed, according to KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh.

"New rules: George Osborne said yesterday that a basic command of the language would be a condition for receiving out-of-work payments . Benefit claimants who cannot speak basic English will see their handouts docked. George Osborne said yesterday that a basic command of the language would be a condition for receiving out-of-work payments. Announcing the new language requirements to MPs, the Chancellor said: ‘From now on, if claimants don’t speak English, they will have to attend language courses until they do. This is a reasonable requirement in this country. ‘It will help people find work. But if you’re not prepared to learn English, your benefits will be cut.’ Around 100,000 people on jobseeker’s allowance and related benefits have worse English than the average nine-year-old, according to official statistics. They will have to take classes to get up to ‘entry level two’ – the standard expected of the nine-year-olds. The £100million annual cost of the scheme will come from the anticipated £250million a year saving from making claimants wait seven days – rather than three – before they can receive unemployment benefits. Lessons to improve the language skills of the workless already cost £50million a year. The Chancellor’s move in his spending review was the centrepiece of a huge shake-up of the welfare state. The unemployed will have to attend a job centre every week instead of every fortnight. And jobless single parents will have to start preparing for work once their youngest child turns three. Treasury officials said they wanted to ‘change the entire mentality’ of job centres. Claimants will have to write a CV and start looking for a job before signing on – rather than the other way round. Mr Osborne also confirmed a strict cap on welfare payments from April 2015 that will cover housing benefit, tax credits, disability benefits and pensioner benefits. The state pension will be excluded. Scroll down for video . Crackdown: Jobseekers will have to attend the job centre once a week instead of once a fortnight under new rules (file picture) The Chancellor called the cap a ‘limit on the nation’s credit card’ and ‘proof that Britain is serious about living within its means’. Future governments will have to comply with the cap by cutting benefits – or explain to Parliament why not. The Chancellor also said the Government was considering further restrictions on the right of foreigners to claim benefits. He said ministers were ‘hemmed in’ by European rules which do not allow them to stop new arrivals claiming handouts. 'Too liberal': Akosuah O'Ansah, with daughter Na'ima, criticised job centres . Akosuah O’Ansah from Ghana fully supports the move to force immigrants claiming benefits to learn English, saying the UK is ‘too liberal’ to foreigners. The law graduate, who has been living in London since July 1994, was forced to give up her job in banking to take care of her daughter in October 2011. She said she reluctantly signed up for benefits after finding it was more financially viable than working and paying for childcare. Now her daughter Na’ima Akansurum is one-year-old, she is keen to get another job. But she said job centre staff had told her ‘not to worry too much’ about returning to work until Na’ima is three. Miss O’Ansah, 35, said she thought making job seekers visit the job centre once a week was a good idea because it might persuade them to get a job. And she said it was important for immigrants to learn English to get their benefits because it would help them to integrate into their community. She said: ‘Why would you stay here and not want to speak English? ‘England is too liberal, it is like Ghana, it is open to everyone. ‘As an African myself it is quite shocking when you go to the GP and people can’t speak English.’ Former Tory former cabinet minister John Redwood urged Mr Osborne to go further. He asked: ‘On the welfare reform, would you look at the idea that any non-British citizen coming to our country should have to work for a period and pay taxes before being eligible for any welfare benefits?’ Mr Osborne replied: ‘One of the challenges, and one of the debates we find in this country and other European countries, is about the eligibility to benefits for people who move here. ‘That’s something where we are hemmed in by European law but there may be opportunities within European law to make some adjustments and we are looking closely at those.’ John Cridland of the CBI business group said: ‘It is encouraging to see that Government will have greater control of the welfare budget through the new cap. 'The Chancellor has carefully walked a tightrope of protecting growth, while making sizeable savings to pay down the debt.’ Richard Hawkes, of the disability charity Scope, said: ‘Disabled people will be extremely concerned about the cap on welfare. ‘After £28.3 billion of cuts, disabled people can’t bear any further squeezes on their living standards.’","100,000 on jobseeker's allowance have worse English than average nine-year-old .

"There's a well-quoted 'Wintourism' that goes: 'It’s always about timing. If it’s too soon, no one understands. If it’s too late, everyone’s forgotten.' However it seems Anna Wintour may have forgetten to live some of the joys of Christmas this year, with that timing obsession seeing Vogue's famed neat freak tossing out her tree before Santa had arrived. Bee Shaffer, daughter of the celebrated perfectionist, posted a photo on her Instagram on Christmas Day showing a bunch of presents and designer shopping bags sitting all of their lonesome. 'My mom threw out our tree before Christmas Day because ""it was too messy""' Shaffer posted. So ... where do we hang the stockings?: Anna Wintour's daughter Bee Shaffer posted this photo on Instagram on Christmas Day showing a heap of presents piled in a corner because her mom decided to get rid of the Christmas tree early . Anna Wintour and her daughter Bee Shaffer, seen here in a photo from Paris Fashion Week 2012, enjoyed a Christmas without a tree this year . Anna Wintour's 19th century townhouse, in an exclusive block of Sullivan Street, Greenwich Village, has become known for its intimate events and celebrity soirees . The holiday snap was presumably taken inside Wintour's Greenwich Village townhouse in New York City, although she also has a home on Long Island. Shaffer, 26, moved back to Manhattan earlier this year from LA, where she had been working for Glee creator Ryan Murphy, to take a job as a segment producer for Seth Meyers at NBC. Just last week, Wintour - who is also Conde Nast's artistic director and reportedly earns over $2 million a year - hosted her annual Christmas party at the Greenwich Village townhouse. Perhaps the tree had already served its festive function when Wintour decided it was to be taken down. Wintour, 64, lives at the house with her long-term partner, Texas-born billionaire and telecommunications pioneer Shelby Ryan. Besides Bee - real name Katherine - the magazine maven has another child, Charles, 28, both with ex-husband David Shaffer. Her home has become known for its elegant events and celebrity soirees. Anna Wintour has built her reputation on precision on taste, so the fact she threw out her Christmas tree before Christmas should not come as a surprise to many . In 2010, neighboring streets such as McDougal and Thompson were closed from 9AM in preparation for an evening soiree that was to be attended by Barack and Michelle Obama, among other celebrities and Manhattan movers and shakers. Wintour's house is 3,960 square-feet and, along with every home in the block, opens up onto an exclusive residents-only park locked within the hollow middle grounds of the building. A nearby townhouse was recently listed for sale with an asking price of $8.8 million, while onetime neighbor Richard Gere sold his place for $12.8 million in 2007. While the tree situation seems a little extreme, Wintour's reputation is based on nothing if not her taste. Anna Wintour and her daughter Bee Shaffer attend Celine fashion house show during the Paris Fashion Week Fall-Winter 2011/12 Ready-to-wear collection in 2011 . Most recently, she cancelled a scheduled Vogue cover featuring twerking 20-year-old pop starlet Miley Cyrus after seeing her infamous VMA performance with Robin Thicke. According to reports, the editrix decided Cyrus would be a bad look for her beloved fashion bible. ‘Anna found the whole thing distasteful,’ a source said. ‘She decided, based on Miley’s performance, to take the cover in a different direction.’","The Vogue editor's daughter, Bee Shaffer, posted a photo to Instagram on December 25 showing a pile of presents in a corner, saying her mom had decided the tree was 'too messy' and got rid of it .

"David Bowie sharing a cigarette with Elizabeth Taylor in  1975. This was the first occasion  the pair - who had an 'amorous friendship' - had met . David Bowie was a sex fanatic who became obsessed with bedding as many partners - men or women - as possible, a new book claims. Bowie's colourful, gender-bending sex life has included rumored relationships with Elizabeth Taylor and Bianca Jagger as well as ones - which the women have themselves confirmed - with Marianne Faithfull and Susan Sarandon. But he has also been linked with a string of men including Mick Jagger - rumours that were encouraged by Bowie's past claims to have been both gay and bi-sexual. In a new book, Bowie, author Wendy Leigh spoke to the singer's friends, ex-lovers, business associates and industry insiders to ask whether he was a sex addict or a show business star who was keen to make himself seem more exciting to fans. Nowadays, Bowie, 67, is a father and lives in conventional matrimony with his Somali supermodel second wife, Iman. However, according to extracts of the new book published in the New York Daily News, Leigh believes that Bowie was only ready to settle down after satisfying a voracious sexual appetite. Leigh describes how Bowie and his first wife, Angie, ‘were notorious about weaving a sexual web around those who took their fancy’ and met while they were having an affair with the same man. Bowie, born in Brixton and raised in modest circumstances in the London suburb of Bromley, was determined to break into London’s music scene. According to Leigh he became ‘adept at playing London’s gay elite’. A Bowie acquaintance from those years put it more bluntly, saying: ‘I said he would either be a gigantic star or make a lot of money in the Piccadilly men’s loo.’ Scroll down for video . Wild: Bowie is believed to have had orgies with his wife and Stones frontman Mick Jagger, the book claims . Angie, a former model, worked for the music executive Lou Reizner, boss of Mercury Records, who helped make Bowie a star. But according to Leigh, Reizner couldn't stand Bowie and helped him only because he feared losing Angie if he didn't, says Leigh. But Angie - who has been credited with playing an instrumental role in moulding Bowie's flamboyant images in his heyday - was desperately keen to become the girlfriend of an emerging rock star. In 1969 - the year of his first hit song Space Oddity - Angie helped Bowie move into a crumbling mansion, Haddon Hall in Bromley. There she catered to his every need, treating him as ‘a pampered prince’ and even running him a bath every morning. According to Leigh, American-born Angie had an ‘uncanny ability to bring home the most free-spirited girls’. They weren't ready just to hop into bed with the bisexual couple but even with others visiting the house, she says. The couple married and had a son named Zowie - derived from the Greek word for life - on May 30, 1970. When he met Iman at a party in 1990, Bowie revealed: 'I was naming the children the night we met' At the same time, Bowie and Angie were working together on his next on-stage and recording persona, the sexually-ambiguous Ziggy Stardust. Bowie insisted to an interviewer at the time that ‘I’m gay and always have been'. A former member of staff at Bowie's record company told Leigh that Bowie had bedded pretty much everyone who worked there, sometimes repeatedly. But at least one of Bowie’s male lovers wondered whether Bowie was actually gay or bisexual - or hankering for attention. The book examines the question whether Bowie was merely a sexual adventurer or an actual sex addict . ‘When we were in bed together, he was more sensual and narcissistic,’ said Tony Zanetta, Bowie’s ex-assistant. ‘To him, it was about being adored... I don’t think sex mattered to him.’ On a US tour in 1972, Angie started a relationship with her husband’s Jamaican bodyguard. But, says Leigh, Mrs Bowie would also join her husband for threesomes with any of the groupies - male or female - who crowded around him. In their new London home in Chelsea, Angie attempted to enclose her wayward husband in a ‘sexual cocoon’ that kept him close to her while allowing him to indulge his appetites for other sexual partners. Their home in Oakley Street boasted what they called 'the pit', a four-foot-deep bed covered in fur in the living room, where they would entertain guests. ‘Angie and David used to have the most amazing orgies at Oakley St. Everybody f****d everybody in the pit. Mick Jagger used to come there and be involved with sexual things,’ a source told Leigh. As Bowie spiralled into a cocaine addiction and became painfully thin, the drugs fuelled his sex drive and he became ‘dedicated to having sex with as many partners as possible’, says Leigh. Bowie has himself admitted as much, once telling a BBC interviewer: 'I was hitting on everybody. I had a wonderfully irresponsible, promiscuous time.' While the singer's relationship with Angie was never mutually exclusive, she reveals that she felt more comfortable about some of his lovers than others. And so while Faithfull had been part of their orgy-pit scene, she was suspicious about his relationship with Bianca Jagger and was upset to see them photographed together shortly after her marriage to Mick ended. To her, the former Stones wife represented a serious threat to their marriage. As for Bianca's ex-husband, Angie famously claims she once found Jagger and Bowie naked in bed together. David Bowie is currently a stay-at-home dad and is so rarely in the public eye now that some call him a recluse . Although an ageing Elizabeth Taylor - 15 years his senior - was rumoured to be one of Bowie's most famous conquests, Leigh merely describes their relationship as ‘an amorous friendship’. She wasn't the only older woman with whom he was linked. Bowie was rumoured to have started an affair with Oona Chaplin, widow of Charlie and 20 years older than him, when he was playing The Elephant Man on stage in 1980. Leigh also describes how the guitarist Slash was just eight-years-old when he walked into a room at home and found Bowie naked with his mother, Ola Hudson. Sixties singer Ronnie Spector, ex-wife of record producer Phil Spector, recalled how she was taken to see him after he performed in New York in 1976. She was led directly to his hotel suite where he was waiting for her, naked. In the late 1970s, Bowie began denying that he had ever been gay or bisexual, insisting it was an image concocted by his managers. His affair with actress Susan Sarandon which lasted three years, after a daliance Oona Chaplin - widow of Charlie Chaplin - who was almost 20 years older than Bowie. Bowie, who split up with Angie in 1980, has admitted he has an addictive personality and Leigh speculates whether it applied not only to drugs but also to sex. If so, he shook the habit. He certainly seemed to have slowed down considerably in the bedroom department by the time he met Iman at a party in Los Angeles in 1990. He said later: ‘I was naming the children the night we met. ‘It was so lucky that we were to meet at that time in our lives, when we both were yearning for each other.’","New book by Wendy Leigh claims David Bowie was a sex fanatic .

"President Barack Obama will make his first appearance on the campaign trail this fall  when he headlines a rally for Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy next week. The Associated Press reported today that Obama will stump for Malloy next Wednesday, Oct. 15.

President Barack Obama hugs Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy upon his arrival at Bradley Air National Guard Base in Hartford, Connecticut during an April 2013 visit. Obama will return to Connecticut next week to campaign for Malloy . Other Democrats up for reelection have avoided President Obama like the plague this fall, but Malloy will appear with him at a rally next week. The two men are pictured here grabbing lunch at Cafe Beauregard restaurant in New Britain, Connecticut, last March . The time Obama did agree to campaign for a Democratic lawmaker, Colorado's Mark Udall, the senator ditched on the day of and Obama had to attend a fundraiser for Udall's campaign alone. Obama has consistently earned approval numbers in the mid-to-low 40s throughout the last several months, and Democratic candidates for statewide and federal offices are fearful of how photos of them standing side by side with the president will play with voters who are unhappy with his policies. Instead, they've invited other top Democrats, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden and First Lady Michelle Obama, to their home states to campaign with them. 'The president is dealing with a lot of crisis in the world right now. I think it's important for him to continue to address what's happening with ISIS and continue to address the Ebola scare. I expect him to be in Washington,' one endangered Democrat, New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, said today when asked by MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell if she'd like Obama to join her on the trail. Malloy doesn't seem to mind affiliating with Obama in public, however, having lunched with him earlier this year during one of the president's trips to his state and inviting him back for an official campaign event next week. The incumbent Democratic governor is locked in a dead heat with his Republican challenger, retired businessman and former U.S. ambassador Tom Foley. Foley ran against Malloy for the state's top executive position in 2010 and lost by just half a percentage point. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday has Foley tied with Malloy at 43 percent. 'It looks like we're heading for another photo finish - just like in 2010,' Douglas Schwartz, director of the Quinnipiac  poll, said of the rematch in a statement. President Obama won Connecticut by 17 points in 2012, making Democrat Malloy's reelection a seemingly forgone conclusion just months ago. But even Connecticut residents have grown tired of Obama more than two years out from the end of his presidency, and they could end up taking their frustrations with the nation's leader out on Malloy. A poll of the state conducted by Quinnipiac in March, when Obama last visited the state, found that just 45 percent of the Connecticut residents viewed Obama positively. The majority, 51 percent, had a negative opinion of the way the president was doing his job. According to Quinnipiac it's the worst Obama's ever polled in the state. No surveys of the state have been taken since.","The president will headline a rally for Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy next Wednesday, Oct. 15.
The president has spoken at more than 50 private fundraisers this year but only one that directly benefited a candidate .

"Staff at the Ministry of Defence have spent £270,000 ringing directory inquiries for telephone numbers which can often be found for free on the internet. A Freedom of Information request has revealed that defence staff called to check a number 158,640 since the last election, at a rate of 186 times every day. The revelations will be embarrassing for Defence Secretary Philip Hammond who has forced soldiers into taking redundancy payments to fill a £38billion black hole in his budget. The MoD has spent £270,000 calling directory inquiries numbers which could have paid the salaries of 15 soldiers. It is not known which 118 service they used . For the same money the Ministry could have kept 15 squaddies in post, bought 270 sets of Osprey body armour, or bought new boots for an entire battalion. The MoD, headed by Philip Hammond (pictured), says it has banned staff from calling 118 numbers, but claimed some staff in isolated areas still used the services . Staff at the Department of Work and Pensions also called directory . enquiries 97,265 times over the same period, costing the taxpayer . £72,387, according to figures released to Sky News. Iain Duncan Smith has been trying to cut the £200billion-a-year bill for welfare and tax credits with changes to benefits. Smith is forcing those on incapacity benefit to undergo strict new tests, cutting payments to those out of work and charging council housing tenants for bedrooms they are not using. An MoD spokesman said: 'Calls to directory enquiries from the majority of the 260,000 MoD fixed phone lines are banned but some staff working in isolated locations, who do not have access to a military phone network or the internet, are able to call directory enquiries to obtain contact details.' A DWP spokesperson said the 118 numbers are used by jobseekers or their advisers when . looking for work, and that the costs of these calls have been cut by more than . two thirds since 2010. The news comes just two months after MoD . staff were outed for spending £40,000 calling the speaking clock 158,640 . times in just two years. Staff were also banned from calling 123 to check the time, but that hasn't stopped them running up a bill of more than £6,000 this year alone. They were even given a list of websites they could use to get the time free, but the final bill for 2012 was £18,804 and £15,162 in 2011. At the time an MoD spokesman said: 'A ban was introduced to our newest telephone network, but due to a technical error with some IT servers there has been some inadvertent spending on the speaking clock which has now been stopped.' Most of the numbers are believed to be available free online, while staff were given a list of websites to visit to get the time .","The £270,000 could have paid for 15 squaddies or a battalion of boots .

"This summer, I went on holiday to France, leaving behind (thanks to Ryanair's carry-on luggage restrictions) my two beloved possessions: my hairdryer and straighteners. For three weeks I did nothing to my unruly hair beyond washing it, putting it up in a bun and letting it dry naturally. It was bliss - as relaxing as not checking my emails. Writer Nora Ephron once said that the upside of death is not having to worry about your hair - it turns out it's the upside of a holiday in the middle of nowhere, too. But a very strange thing happened when I stopped 'doing' my hair - I found my natural hair didn't look that bad. Smooth vs wavy: Marianne after taming her curls, left, and more natural look, right . Left to their own devices for once, my locks became a mass of curls and waves. Some days the effect was chaotic, on others it was soft and natural. I grew to like it. So did my travelling companion, who couldn't understand why I'd been hiding my natural curls for so long. 'You should keep it that way when you go home,' she said. 'Seriously, it suits you. And you look less uptight.' A backhanded compliment, yes, but does she have a point? Back in London, trying to look professional and together, could I really let my hair out on the loose and spend two weeks of my real life without straighteners? My hairdresser thinks I can. 'You have pre-Raphelite hair, with a lot of texture and curl. You should do nothing to it,' says Lance Lowe, of Lancelot and Carmina salon in Marylebone, London. And though it seems like a terrifying prospect, I have to admit that it does hold a certain appeal. Fight the frizz: Marianne has been battling with her hair for years . My adult life has been spent in daily battle against my hair. Thick, wiry and frizzy - naturally the consistency of a Brillo pad - the only way I feel it looks respectable is when a professional does it or when I punish it at home with hair straighteners. I got my first pair of GHD ceramic straighteners in 2004. It seemed almost miraculous to me that with the flick of a switch I could transform my messy mop into something sleek and smooth. I fell in love. Soon I was using them almost every day, happily ignoring the damage being done to my split ends by the heat. Sometimes when, out of laziness, I straightened my hair while it was still damp (which you're not meant to do because it's so damaging) I could hear my hair sizzle. Steam would rise from my head. But no matter! Anything for smooth sleek hair. 'We've been brain-washed into thinking there's only one way to look good and that's with straight, smooth hair' And it's not just me. According to one survey, a third of women own a pair of straighteners and a quarter refuse to leave the house without first ironing their hair into Jennifer Aniston-like smoothness. But all this straightening comes at a high price. Trichologists are warning us that the damage caused by straighteners can make hair frizzier and curlier, setting up a 'straightener addiction'. 'Repeated straightening at high heat makes the smooth, protective cuticle that surrounds the hair fibres become flaky and rough,' says Iain Sallis, Britain's only hospital trichologist with seven private clinics around the country. 'This makes the hair appear more frizzy and less shiny. Women control this new frizz by straightening the hair more, which dries and damages it further, causing yet more frizzing, which requires more straightening and so on. Eventually hair becomes so damaged that it can break off.' What's more, I've found recently that I'm going off the straightened look. During the past decade, it seems as if 90 per cent of the female population has been walking around with straight hair. 'People have started to look like clones,' says my hairdresser, Lance. 'We've been brain-washed into thinking there's only one way to look good and that's with straight, smooth hair - but that's not true. 'We all look better working with what we've naturally got, instead of fighting against it.' New outlook: The writer thinks women should embrace their curls instead of banishing them to look like clones (posed by model) Lance, who does the hair for catwalk shows including Alexander McQueen, says he's starting to see women trying out fuller, curlier styles. In celeb-land, Rihanna and Nicole Kidman have been pictured recently with natural curls. While I'm apprehensive, the prospect of clawing back the hours I spend trying to tame it is irresistible. So, for a fortnight, I will subject the world to my mad, untamed hair and learn to love my curls. How hard can it be? Very, as it turns out. The first day I walk out with my natural hair, I feel like a mad woman. Maybe it's a damp day or being on the Tube, but my hair has not fallen into curls or waves - it is pure frizz. I catch my reflection in a shop window and think I look deranged. My hair is just so big. I realise that with straight, well-behaved hair I blend in, but with my own bushy hair I stand out. I don't like it. I lose my nerve and scrape my hair up into a bun. There's something liberating about just accepting what you've got; even if it is a giant, messy mop of ginger hair . The next day I go to a meeting with wild hair and feel like an unprofessional mess. I didn't appreciate how much I relied on straightened hair as part of my work armour. My colleagues were all kind - but I think they were being diplomatic. One said it looked 'Bohemian' in a way that didn't sound like a compliment. I realise that the natural look involves work and so start to experiment with different ways to make my hair less of a frizzy mess and more 'natural curl'. So far the techniques include putting mousse through damp hair and then twisting it into a bun or plaits before I go to bed. When I wake up in the morning I undo the hair and it comes out in nice waves. If I want it more bouncy and curly, I use Bumble and Bumble's Curl Conscious Calming Cream (£23.50, bumbleandbumble.co.uk). I run it through my hair when it's wet, then dry it for just a few minutes with a diffuser, which adds volume and curls my hair. By the end of the first week I'm starting to get compliments. Girlfriends tell me I look younger and a couple of the more fashionable ones tell me it’s 'cool'. The only people not won over are my male friends, who invariably prefer sleek and smooth, which they say is more 'sexy and sophisticated'. I see their point; there is something about a good blowdry or silky smooth hair that is very touchable and seductive. But the funny thing is that I don't care too much what anyone thinks. By the end of week two I've learned to love my natural look. There's something liberating about just accepting what you've got; even if it is a giant, messy mop of ginger hair. So could this be the start of a new me? What next? Ditching the make-up? I don't think so. But I won't go back to using straighteners every day. For the moment, the GHDs are staying in a box under the bed. The one-woman war against my hair is over.","Marianne's adult life has been spent in daily battle against her hair .

"A woman who developed anorexia after obsessing over stick-thin celebrities has beaten the illness - by being crowned Miss Toned Figure in a  bodybuilding tournament. Charlotte MacGill, 26, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, would pore over pictures of painfully thin models and celebrities such as Victoria Beckham. She would then starve herself and exercise to excess in a bid for an elusive 'thigh-gap'. But as her weight dropped below eight stone, her health deteriorated. She became depressed and suffered skin problems, thinning hair and bad breath. It was only when she started a job as a physiotherapist and took up weight training that she managed to turn her life around. Scroll down for video . Charlotte MacGill, now 26, says taking up bodybuilding saved her from anorexia. She is pictured above at her lowest weight, when she would starve herself and exercise to excess in a bid for an elusive 'thigh-gap' She has now been crowned Miss Toned Figure after swapping starvation for healthy food and weight training . Now Ms MacGill has become a muscly transformation of her former self, winning regional, national and global bodybuilding competitions. She said: 'I became really body conscious when I was 16 and started going to aerobics with my mum. 'Suddenly I was desperate to look like celebrities like Britney Spears who had washboard stomachs and Victoria Beckham with her slim thighs. 'But bodybuilding changed my life - I know how to exercise properly now and can't believe how unhealthy I was before.' As a teenager, Ms MacGill became influenced by airbrushed models and slim celebrities in magazines and strived to look exactly like them. In particular she craved a 'thigh gap' and washboard stomach. At 18 she joined a gym and became addicted to exercise. She said: 'I just wanted to run any excess weight off. I ran six days a week. 'My goal was always to stay below eight stone, so you could see my ribs and I'd have a 'thigh gap'. 'For more than two years, I worked out religiously at the gym but didn't know what I was doing or how to achieve what I wanted. I was desperate for the size zero body shape I saw in magazines.' Still not happy with the way she looked, she started dieting in the hope of gaining the 'perfect' figure. Ms MacGill (pictured centre in a green bikini) competing at the a global bodybuilding competition . 'I know how to exercise properly now and can't believe how unhealthy I was before,' Ms Mac Gill says, pictured left . Her addiction continued while she studied sport rehabilitation at the University of Bolton, with the added strain of the typical student lifestyle on her body. She said: 'When I went on nights out with friends, I'd binge on drinks as well as takeaways. That way, I could convince myself I wasn't anorexic. 'We'd get junk food after leaving a nightclub but I'd feel guilty afterwards and have to run even further on the treadmill. 'In fact, the takeaways were probably the only thing stopping me from becoming dangerously thin. I was so hungry sometimes that I would binge-eat on cakes and sweets. 'A couple of times, I made myself sick and that's when I realised I had lost control. 'It wasn't an eating disorder, but it was starting to become one.' Ms Mac Gill starved herself and exercised to excess from the age of 16. She suffered side effects like thinning hair, bad breath, spots and I sometimes became depressed about life. She is pictured (left and right) as a teenager when her eating disorder began . She added: 'I would just repeat the diet every day and I started to suffer side effects like thinning hair, bad breath, spots and I sometimes became depressed about life. 'Looking back, it's clear that I did have an eating disorder but I didn't see it then.' After graduating, Ms MacGill got a job as a physiotherapist in her hometown of Bolton and her obsession with exercise didn't go unnoticed by her boss. Worried that she had a warped body image and was in no position to help rehabilitate their clients, he asked her to write down her daily diet. She said: 'He said my diet was shocking and told me I should stop running. He gave me an eating plan to increase my calories and got me doing weight training four times a week. 'He introduced a lot more healthy carbohydrates into my diet and tripled the amount I was eating. 'I was really worried I was going to get fat but I knew he knew what he was talking about. I put all my trust in him. 'I had porridge or muesli for breakfast, lots of rice and chicken, sweet potatoes, low fat rice pudding and bananas.' She warns  success in bodybuilding competitions doesn't come easy - it requires months of strict dieting and training. Now, she hopes to inspire women to aim to be toned and healthy, not skinny . Ms MacGill began bodybuilding, as well as eating a lot more healthy carbohydrates tripled the amount she was eating. A year later she entered her first bodybuilding competition and won it. She is pictured holding outfits to wear in competitions . Within just two months, Ms MacGill was so pleased with the transformation in her body shape, she decided she wanted to try out for a competition run by the National Amateur Bodybuilders' Association (NABBA). She said: 'My boss was amazed when I got serious about bodybuilding so quickly, but I wanted something to focus on. 'I was building muscle as well as fat and I felt so much better in myself, so I entered my first competition eight weeks later. She won her first regional competition in May 2012, but after the losing the next one, took some time out from competing to train properly. In October 2014, she entered three competitions in the 'toned figure' category and was crowned champion in all three - including the global title. But she warns the success doesn't come easy - it requires months of strict dieting and training. She said: 'I eat lots of white fish and green vegetables, oats and rice cakes. I'm very strict with myself and don't have any treats at all. MsMacGill says she has the full support of her boyfriend, who is also a bodybuilder. Both plan to compete next year to add to the regional, national and globlal titles Ms MacGill has already won . In October 2014 she entered three competitions run by the National Amateur Bodybuilders' Association (NABBA) - and won all of them . 'But, when I'm not getting ready to compete, I pig out and eat whatever I like. I love pick'n'mix and chocolate and have such a sweet tooth.' 'Knowing you have a goal in mind makes it all worth it, though. You get a thrill from it - it feels amazing to build your own physique. I get lots of compliments on my figure and lots of requests for arm wrestles!' Ms MacGill has the full support of her boyfriend, fellow physiotherapist John Ramsay, 28, who is also a bodybuilder. 'We're like a normal couple and go out for meals together when we're not preparing for a competition, but when we are, we have to be careful about what we're eating. 'We cook each other meals and say, 'How many grams of protein would you like?' Both plan to compete again next year and Ms MacGill believes her transformation isn't over yet. She said: 'My family and friends are really supportive and follow what I do. They're so proud that I'm healthy now and I've changed my body image. 'Obsessing over unrealistic celebrity images was really damaging to me as a teenager so I hope that my new body shape will inspire teenage girls to concentrate on being toned and healthy rather than skinny.'

"A 50-year-old Arizona man who killed his stepdaughter's boyfriend after running over him twice with his Cadillac received a sentence of 20 years in prison for second-degree murder. Michael Anthony Rivera must also serve a 10-year sentence concurrently for attempted first-degree murder for also trying to run down Nicholas Gerenscer's father and brother. Rivera pleaded guilty in July to committing the acts, which occurred in November 2011 in front of the Gerenscer family's home in Kingman, Arizona. Nicholas Gerenscer, pictured at right, was killed in November 2011 after Michael Anthony Rivera ran him over twice in front of his own home . Authorities say there was bad blood between the families of Rivera and Gerenscer that extended back to California, the Kingman Daily Miner reported. Less than a month after the murder, Gerenscer's cousin, Jesse Camacho, and two accomplices assaulted one of Rivera's daughters and her boyfriend during a home invasion. Rivera received a 20-year sentence for second-degree murder for twice running over 23-year-old Nicholas Gerenscer in November 2011. The relatively minor sentence resulted from a plea deal he made just before a trial was set to begin in July . Camacho pleaded guilty and is serving six years in jail. The father, Nick Gerenscer Sr, admitted to being a gang member, but his son wasn't, his mother tearfully told the court. 'Somebody said he's a gang member. That's BS. Little Nick had a big mouth, but Little Nick was not a gang member,' Renee Ceniceros said. 'My son didn't want to hurt nobody.' While Ceniceros was hoping for a first-degree murder trial, Rivera accepted a plea deal in July, just days before the trial was set to begin. The sentencing feels like closure but won't bring back her son, she said. 'He's dead and we've got to keep marching, which is unfortunate for us,' she said. 'I'll never get to see the man my son might have been except for you.'

"The founder of a Mormon women's rights group faces being excommunicated from her church after leading a demonstration in Salt Lake City. Two months ago Kate Kelly defied church orders to led hundreds of people in a rally at Temple Square to highlight gender inequality in the Mormon faith. On Sunday, she received a letter from the bishop of her Virginia congregation telling her a disciplinary hearing had been set to discuss her being removed from the church. Removed: Kate Kelly may be excommunicated from her church over a rally to highlight gender inequality in the Mormon faith . Kelly, who founded Ordain Women, said she was shocked, dismayed and devastated by the letter, which informed her that a hearing had been set for June 22. She has been accused of apostasy, which was defined as repeated and public advocacy of positions that oppose church teachings. The church has also made similar moves to excommunicate John Dehlin, who created a website forum for Mormons who were questioning their faith. He received a letter on Monday from a church leader in Logan, Utah, that told Dehlin to resign from his faith by June 18 or face an excommunication hearing. The letter said church leaders were concerned by comments he had made recently about no longer believing fundamental teachings of the Mormon faith. The cases against the two lifelong members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints mark the most high-profile examples of excommunication proceedings since 1993, Armand Mauss, a retired professor of sociology and religious studies at Washington State University, said. That year, the church disciplined six Mormon writers who questioned doctrine, ousting five and removing a sixth temporarily. Change: Kate Kelly, right, founded the Ordain Women group that wants the priesthood to no longer be solely for men . Church leaders seem to be drawing a line between private or informal expressions of discontent with church teachings and public protests aimed at pressuring the church, Mauss said. 'The LDS Church is not a democratic institution, and has never claimed to be,' Mauss said. 'So such actions are interpreted by church leaders as attempts to displace or undermine their legitimate authority over church policies and teachings.' Singling out two critics of church policy who have made themselves very visible seems like 'boundary maintenance' by the church, Jan Shipps, a retired religion professor from Indiana who is a non-Mormon expert on the church, said. 'They are saying to folks ""If you go this far, you are risking your membership"",' Shipps said. Church officials said in a statement Wednesday that there is room for questions and sincere conversations about the faith, but that some members' actions 'contradict church doctrine and lead others astray'. In certain cases, local leaders step in to clarify false teachings and ensure other members aren't misled, the church's statement said. Disciplinary hearings come only after members are counseled and encouraged to change behavior. 'Some members in effect choose to take themselves out of the church by actively teaching and publicly attempting to change doctrine to comply with their personal beliefs,' the statement reads. 'This saddens leaders and fellow members.' Even if Kelly and Dehlin are kicked out of the church, the door will remain open for them to repent and return someday. Excommunication is not a lifelong ban. Nobody has solid numbers on how many church members are excommunicated each year, but the number is probably between 10,000 to 20,000, a fraction of the 15 million worldwide members, said Matt Martinich, a member of the LDS church who analyzes membership numbers with the nonprofit Cumorah Foundation. Removed: John Dehlin could also face excommunication after starting an online forum for Mormons who were questioning their faith . Kelly and Dehlin both hope to be allowed to continue to be members of a church that they love and that has been a part of their lives since birth. Both served Mormon missions and were married in temples. Kelly, an international human rights lawyer, said she stands behind everything she has done since forming Ordain Women in 2013. She said she has not spoken out against church leaders or church doctrine, saying only in public that men and women are not equal in the faith. The bishop's letter doesn't include precise examples of why they accuse her of apostasy. Her group drew the ire of church leaders in April when they marched in Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City and asked to be allowed in a meeting reserved for members of the priesthood, which includes most males in the church who are 12 and older. They had been told previously they wouldn't be let in, and warned by church leaders to stay off church property to preserve the sanctity of general conference weekend. Mormon church officials say the women's group views represent only a small fraction of church members. Kelly doesn't plan to attend the June 22 disciplinary hearing in Virginia, calling it 'both cowardly and un-Christ like' to hold the meeting after she had moved to Utah. She does plan to send in a package of letters from friends, families and other members of Ordain Women about how they've been inspired and their faith strengthened by joining the group. Kelly said the feminist Mormon movement won't die even if she's kicked out of the religion. 'Disciplining arbitrarily and unfairly one person is not going to stop this movement,' Kelly said. Dehlin, a doctoral candidate in psychology who previously worked in the high tech industry, said he believes he's being targeted not only for the website, Mormonstories.org, which he started nine years ago, but also for his outspoken support of the LGBT community. He said he has no plans to take down the website or back down from being an ally for gays and lesbians. But Dehlin said he worries about the effects the upcoming proceedings may have on his four children and wife, and Mormons everywhere who have misgivings. 'Excommunicating me sends the message to thousands of church members who are struggling with doubts and questions that they are not welcome in the church,' Dehlin said.","Kate Kelly may be excommunicated over campaign to have both sexes in the priesthood .

Miss Polizzi had tried to turn around the fortunes of the family's firms – Kettley's Furniture Store and Kettley's Funeral Directors – in Yeadon, West Yorkshire. But Butler had been resistant to the changes she made, the court heard. His eldest son David, 31, told Leeds Crown Court: 'Two years ago I noticed a significant change in my father in the shop, in what he was doing and saying. The biggest change was when we went on television. 'The show's makers wanted to change a lot of things in the shop. Me and my family wanted the changes, but he didn't.

'He was going off in a huff and people were coming in and ripping up the carpets. He had put a lot of effort into the business, and when you see someone coming from the outside world and doing that to your business it does have a profound effect on you.' Although the couple were not married, Miss Butler had changed her surname by deed poll. The court heard she had fallen out of love with her partner and felt aggrieved at his lack of support when she had battled breast cancer ten years ago. They began leading separate lives, watching television apart in different rooms of the family home, before Miss Butler moved out in March. On April 14, Butler, who denies murder, went to the nearby flat where she was living, believing she was seeing another man, the court heard. Prosecutor Michelle Colborne, QC, said: 'He lost his temper, old-fashioned good and simple. He picked up a knife and stabbed her in what the prosecution say was a sustained attack. 'It was done with the intention of killing Pauline Butler or causing her serious harm.' When the family's business was featured in the show, the BBC programme said: 'Kettley's Furniture has been run by John Butler and his family for 33 years, but it just hasn't moved on in that time' Miss Polizzi had tried to turn around the fortunes of the family's furniture store and funeral directors in Yeadon . The jury heard he then washed the knife, left it on the draining board, put her dog in the car, locked up and drove home. The couple's middle son, Richard, saw his father walk in with blood on his face, carrying a blood-stained orange towel. Butler told him: 'You need to call the police, I think I have killed your mother', the court heard. Butler wept in court as his eldest son gave evidence. David said: 'My father is emotionally a very private man, doesn't wear his heart on his sleeve. He's a born and bred Yorkshireman who doesn't say what he feels.' David added that he was never told his parents weren't married. The court heard the night before the alleged murder, David handed his mother £100 for maintenance from his father. David said Miss Butler 'went mad and said she wanted half the house', which was worth around £500,000. 'When she was given the money ... she said she thought it was an insult,' he said. Miss Butler was also visited by her youngest son Paul that evening, and she told him she felt her children were taking their father's side. David added: 'She expressed hatred of my father. She refused to even touch or give me a hug.' Commenting on his evidence, he told the jury: 'I'm not here to defend my father, I'm not on the side of my mother either. 'It's a tragedy and I'm here to tell the truth on both parts. What happens happens. I know I have lost both my parents.' Mr Justice Edis told the jury not to seek out the episode of the BBC programme featuring the family. 'It is undesirable for people who have seen it and remember it to serve on this jury,' he said. 'It touches on the defendant and his family life and you might get a view, favourable or unfavourable, if you watch him on the telly. So don't watch him on the telly.' Butler told police he had gone to his estranged partner's flat to mend her microwave. He said they argued and she pushed him, causing him to lose his balance and fall on to her with a knife.

"Ibrahim Hewitt, an Islamist fundamentalist who says homosexuals should be lashed . A school run by a Muslim hardliner was citing sharia in its child protection policies, it emerged yesterday. Ofsted inspectors found that Al-Aqsa school in Leicester operated on the basis that ‘Ulama’ – Islamic scholars – should be consulted in child abuse and welfare cases, as well as ‘relevant outside agencies’. The school – founded by Ibrahim Hewitt, an Islamist fundamentalist who says homosexuals should be lashed – declared ‘sharia and the law of the land will be the prime arbiters in child protection concerns’. This raised the prospect of a different level of protection for Muslim children, said critics. Ofsted made it clear only British law should be followed. The school then revised its protection policy to exclude references to sharia law. Ofsted had been sent into the £1,800-a-year independent school, which has 260 pupils aged three to 13, after the Department for Education ordered an inspection following the exposure of Hewitt’s extremist views by The Mail on Sunday earlier this year. Last night Maryam Namazie, of anti-extremist pressure group One Law For All, said: ‘It is an outrage when children of Muslim parents cannot have the same protections as other children.’ The Department for Education, which can shut the school, said it was keeping it under scrutiny. The school said it had always given priority to UK law and its action plan has been accepted by the Department.

"Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced today that he had approved a recommendation from a top general to quarantine all soldiers returning from Ebola-afflicted countries for 21 days in West Africa before allowing them to return to the U.S. Acting on behalf of the heads of all the armed services divisions of the military, Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Tuesday asked Hagel to instate the quarantine rules. The Army, acting on its own authority, had already announced  a mandatory quarantine for its soldiers at a base near Venice, Italy. The move has sparked intense outrage from Italian officials. 'They shouldn't have been sent here, they should do their quarantine for Ebola at home,'  the president of the region's assembly, Luca Zaia, said according to a local news report. Scroll down for video . Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said today that he has approved a recommendation by military leaders that all U.S. troops returning from Ebola response missions in West Africa be kept in supervised isolation for 21 days . Zaia said 'it would have been more respectful' of the U.S. if it had 'thought about the risks posed to local citizens.' Major General Darryl Williams, the commander of the U.S. military operation in Liberia placed himself and 11 members of his staff in isolation at the Vicenza, Italy base earlier this week. None of the military personnel are showing symptoms of Ebola, the news report said, but the hospital there has set aside a special wing with five beds just in case any of them do. Hagel said today at a conference in Washington, D.C. that all service divisions of the military will now have to abide by a similar quarantine. The Pentagon chief said Wednesday that it had approved the request after the families and communities of the roughly 1,000 service members working in Liberian and Senegal voiced concerns about the possibility of an Ebola outbreak. 'The fact is the military will have more Americans in Liberia than any other department,' Hagel said, today during an on-stage interview at the Washington Ideas Forum, an annual event hosted by the Aspen Institute and The Atlantic. 'Our people are younger, the cohorts are different, they are not volunteers,' he continued. Hagel said that the need for a new policy 'was discussed in great detail by the communities, by the families of our military men and women, and they very much wanted a safety valve on this.' The Defense Secretary also disclosed to the audience that he ordered the Joint Chiefs to provide him with a blueprint of how the quarantine will be implemented within the next 15 days and a progress report after 45 days have passed. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement that the 'review will offer a recommendation on whether or not such controlled monitoring should continue based on what we learn and observe from the initial waves of personnel returning from Operation United Assistance.' Kirby noted that Hagel felt the quarantine was necessary given the large number of troops in West Africa who are aiding Ebola health workers and the 'unique logistical demands and impact this deployment has on the force. 'The secretary's highest priority is the safety and security of our men and women in uniform and their families,' Hagel's spokesman said. The Department of Defense's announcement today was not unexpected. The White House confirmed yesterday that DOD was considering an service-wide quarantine. President Barack Obama also acknowledged the probable policy shift on Tuesday. After the Obama gave reporters a brief update on the administration's efforts to slow down the rate of Ebola infections in West Africa, he took a single question from the press. The reporter asked Obama if he was concerned there might be 'confusion' about why states are introducing different quarantine rules than the federal government. 'Well, the military is a different situation, obviously, because they are, first of all, not treating patients,' Obama said, whereas health workers being put into quarantine once they arrive in the U.S. do have direct contact with Ebola patients. 'Second of all, they are not there voluntarily, it’s part of their mission that's been assigned to them by their commanders and ultimately by me, the Commander-in-Chief,' he asserted. 'So we don't expect to have similar rules for our military as we do for civilians. They are already, by definition, if they're in the military, under more circumscribed conditions.' Members of the Department of Defense's Ebola Military Medical Support Team dress with protective gear during a training seminar at San Antonio Military Medical Center last week. States have introduced policies requiring the at-home monitoring of medical professionals who've recently traveled to Ebola-stricken countries. The military will require their personnel to undergo mandatory quarantines in West Africa . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest gave a similar explanation to reporters at his daily briefing on Tuesday. 'I don’t think it’s a particular surprise to anybody who understands that it’s not uncommon for the policy that’s implemented for civilians to be different than the policy that’s implemented for our military service personnel,' he said. 'That’s not unusual.' Earnest also pointed out that policies requiring the at-home monitoring of medical professionals returning from West Africa are different because 'we’re talking about a couple of dozen health care workers a week' coming back.' 'When we’re talking about military personnel, we’re talking about thousands of military service members who have been or will be deployed to West Africa to carry out the mission that the President ordered,' the White House spokesman said. 'And in order to monitor their health, it simply is easier to do that if their movements are restricted and they’re all co-located,' he stressed. Earnest told reporters that it's important to keep in mind that that the quarantine is not that dissimilar from the other 'kinds of sacrifices that our military service members make on a daily basis.' 'There are a wide range of sacrifices that our men and women in uniform make for the sake of efficiency and for the sake of uniformity and for the success of our military,' he said, and this is just one of them. The Obama aide also reasserted the administration's position that mandatory quarantines for civilians not showing symptoms of Ebola are undesirable and over the top. 'Implementing this military policy in a civilian context would only have the effect of hindering our Ebola response by dissuading civilian doctors and nurses from traveling to West Africa to stop the outbreak in its tracks,' he said. 'The only way that we can entirely eliminate the Ebola risk to the American people is to stop this outbreak in its tracks in West Africa.' Hagel, left, told National Correspondent of the Atlantic James Fallows Hagel said that the need for a new quarantine policy 'was discussed in great detail by the communities, by the families of our military men and women, and they very much wanted a safety valve on this.' The conversation took place at the Washington Ideas Forum, hosted by The Aspen Institute and the Atlantic, in Washington, D.C. At Wednesday's invite-only gathering in Washington, D.C. of top government and business leaders, Hagel also gave an assessment of the military's efforts to eliminate ISIS in Iraq and Syria. As the Obama administration and military leaders have said time and time again, defeating ISIS 'will require a steady, long-term effort,' Hagel said. Later he professed, 'I think we're in for a longer term challenge here,' maybe more than 'any of us' had hoped. 'But that's the world that we live in,' he added. 'We've got a monster out there. And we gotta be smart about it.' Hagel warned that 'each one of these issues' involving U.S. security 'regardless of where they are affects us now and will continue to affect us in the future.' And meeting them will require a partnership between the military and Congress, he said, because Congress the government's finances. 'So we need them,' he said. 'We can't do this any other way.' The upcoming midterm elections will hopefully 'self correct' the gridlock in Congress and allow for a closer partnership between the administration and lawmakers, the Pentagon chief said.","Army Gen.

"Manchester City booked their place in the knockout phase of the UEFA Youth League with a 4-2 victory over CSKA Moscow on Wednesday afternoon. A double from Brandon Barker, plus goals from Jack Byrne and Thierry Ambrose, ensured City preserved their 100 per cent record at Hyde and progressed to the round of 16. Patrick Vieira's men sit six points clear of closest challengers Roma and can guarantee top spot in Group E with a point in their next fixture, at home to Bayern Munich on November 25. Manchester City celebrate one of their goals in the 4-2 UEFA Youth League win over CSKA Moscow . Manchester City: Gunn, Smith-Brown, Maffeo, Adarabioyo, Angelino, Bryan, Ambrose, Ntcham, Byrne (Kongolo 87), Pozo (Buckley 84), Barker (Dilrosun 75) Substitutes not used: Albinson (GK), Bossaerts, Tattum, Oliver . Scorers: Byrne 7; Barker 32, 74; Ambrose 90+2 . Booked: Smith-Brown, Tasende .

Substitutes not used: Pomazun, Freapontov, Saraev . Scorers: Golovin 30; Zhamaletdinov 50 . Booked: Glukhov . Referee: Jens Maae (Denmark) City won 2-0 in freezing cold Moscow a fortnight ago, courtesy of two Jose Angel Pozo goals, and it was no surprise to see Vieira field pretty much the same team at Ewen Fields. With qualification at stake, City seized the initiative from the first whistle and gained the lead after just seven minutes. Barker saw his shot saved by CSKA goalkeeper Ivan Zlobin after cutting in from the left-hand side and Pozo set up Byrne for the simplest of far post finishes. Cheered on by a sizeable Wednesday afternoon crowd in the Manchester sunshine, City continued to surge forward with Angelino firing over the bar and Olivier Ntcham striking the crossbar with a long-range shot. City squandered two or three other presentable openings and paid the price when Alexander Golovin tucked away the rebound after his initial effort had been saved at point-blank range by City goalkeeper Angus Gunn. The Russian weren't on level terms for long, however, as Barker pounced on a loose ball and sprinted into the box to fire across the keeper and into the far corner. Zlobin was helpess to keep that one out but he saved at the feet of both Barker and Ntcham before half-time to keep the contest in the balance. Patrick Vieira's men have a 100 per cent record in the UEFA Youth League this season . CSKA started the second half brightly and levelled the game at 2-2 five minutes after the break. Timur Zhamaletdinov capitalised on a defensive slip by Gunn and Kean Bryan to score. City gradually reasserted their authority and retook the lead when Barker tapped home the rebound after Smith-Brown's effort was blocked by a defender. This time there would be no CSKA fightback and City made sure of the three points - and their passage to the next round - when Ambrose headed in a Javairo Dilrosun cross in stoppage time.","Manchester City beat CSKA Moscow to reach last 16 .

"Schoolgirl Charlotte Cutt is almost dwarfed by the pumpkin she has nurtured from a seed. However, it’s not only her green fingers which have helped it to swell to a 28-stone giant. The vegetable has been helped on its way by polyhalite, a super fertiliser from deep under the ground near her family’s home. Scroll down for video . Massive: Charlotte Cutt, eight, grew the giant pumpkin from seed and has sold it to a restaurant for £100 . Charlotte, eight, and her father Matthew, 40, wanted to test claims about the mineral’s potency – and the results were certainly dramatic. Polyhalite is a naturally occurring mineral, often found in potash mines, and makes for an excellent all-purpose fertiliser because it contains potassium, sulphur, magnesium and calcium. Tens of thousands of pumpkins are rotting in the fields, prompting warnings of a shortage for Hallowe’en. The recent heavy rain and humid conditions have caused ripening pumpkins to become scarred and mushy. It has also meant that the machinery used to harvest them gets stuck in the mud. Rot has claimed up to 50 per cent of some crops in the key pumpkin-growing region of Lincolnshire. One of the largest growers in the county said: ‘There will be a huge shortage. I’m afraid a lot of children will have to go without pumpkins to carve this year.’ Father-of-two Mr Cutt said: ‘It’s so big, it just doesn’t look real and it’s a fantastic colour. ‘The good summer we had helped and it just grew and grew and grew. It’s absolutely brilliant.’ After sowing the seed indoors in April, they moved it outside and sprinkled the compost with crushed polyhalite every ten days or so. Charlotte also watered the plant daily at their home in Sleights, North Yorkshire, but that’s all the help it received. Mr Cutt, a lobster fisherman, and his wife Gillian, 44, managed to get hold of some blocks of local polyhalite to begin the DIY experiment. The fruit began to form in July and grew...and grew. Mr Cutt said: ‘We didn’t know how big it was going to get – but it got bigger and bigger.’ It is Hallowe’en soon, however, and there’s no escape for the pumpkin. A restaurant has paid £100 for it and the money will go to a local school. Plans to mine the local polyhalite, the highest grade potash in the world, face opposition as the deposits are in the North York Moors National Park. A decision will be made next year. The world record for a pumpkin is 2,096 lbs (nearly 150-stone).

He is being represented by Manhattan family lawyers Cohen Goldstein, while Lauren’s attorney is marked as unknown. The couple have been married for 10 years and have a seven-year-old son called Adam. Cowell, 53, and Lauren, 36, are believed to have met while on vacation in Barbados some years ago through Mr Silverman. A friend of Lauren's told of .

Today, a source claimed there had . been issues in the Silvermans' marriage right from the start – claiming . that Mr Silverman’s parents Eleonora and Allen never attended their . wedding. A source said: . ‘Andrew’s parents boycotted their wedding because they had their doubts . about Lauren, she thought she was suspect.’ Andrew now believes Lauren started cheating on him with Simon during one of the many vacations they all shared together. The . pal added:‘They would organise these month-long trips and Andrew would . go for two weeks and then leave for business and Lauren would stay . behind. ‘And people talked when she left their little boy at home and stayed away for a month.’ Happy families: Lauren Silverman, Andrew Silverman, their son Adam and Lauren's sister Nicole Davis are all smiles at Bridgehampton Polo in August 2007 . The couple and their son have been living in a stunning apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a ‘white glove condominium’ aptly named The Savoy since 2000. The condo was actually bought by Andrew’s father, Allen, for $1,213,500 (£800k) in 1999 and remains in his name. The property, will, of course, now be worth considerably more. The building boasts a doorman, concierge, valet service, health club and a sundeck overlooking Manhattan – with superstore Bloomingdales just a block away. Andrew works alongside his father Allen, who founded property company The Andalex Group by combining his sons names, Andrew and Alexander, in the 1980s. The family own a string of Manhattan apartments as well as a $4.5million (£3m) country home in Stamford, Connecticut. The Silvermans have been firm fixtures on the New York social scene for many years and as they became firmly ensconced in Simon Cowell’s camp of close friends, Lauren became especially friendly with New York designer Rachel Roy. We are family: Simon Cowell is expecting a baby with his married lover Lauren Silverman, seen right. The couple are pictured on vacation in August 2011 with Lauren's estranged husband Andrew Silverman and Cowell's ex Sinitta . Friends before lovers: X Factor Svengali Cowell and Lauren Silverman met through her husband Andrew, a good friend of the star . The irony is such that stunning Rachel, 39,  was forced to deny that she was dating Cowell after posting pictures from aboard his yacht during a New Year jaunt around the Caribbean in January, with her spokeswoman telling Page Six at the time: ‘She is on vacation with Simon. They are just friends.’ The high-profile couple never made a secret of their friendship with Cowell and indeed when questions were constantly asked about the exact nature of Lauren’s friendship with the X Factor svengali, the reply would always be the same – an insistence that they were just close friends, and that Lauren was merely the wife of one of Cowell’s best friends. The couple were even mentioned in Tom Bower’s 2012 tell-all book on Cowell, Sweet Life:The Intimate Life Of Simon Cowell. Interestingly, Lauren handed over a picture to be published in the tome, taken on a New Year 2012 vacation on board the Slipstream yacht in St Barts. She hovers in a hot pink sundress above Cowell, while he sits next to his ex-fiancee Mezhgan Husseiny, whose enticing curves are on show in a bikini. Her husband Andrew beams up at the camera, sitting at the end of the group, which features Cowell’s best friend Sinitta. Fast forward a few months and Lauren turned up to the book launch at London’s Serpentine Gallery in April, smiling sweetly for the cameras – joining Cowell as he took Bower and friends to the trendy Arts Club for dinner and drinks after the bash, where he joked: ‘“Being invited here was rather like a cat inviting a mouse to a dinner party.’ The book ends as Cowell flirts with a ‘feisty’ Brazilian beauty called Ana Paula Junqueira – and invites her back to his yacht in Barbados. Luxury: Simon Cowell and his friends Lauren and Andrew Silverman enjoyed many vacations on board the Slipstream yacht .

'No one could suppress a smile as they saw it sailing past on its way to HMS Belfast.' Miss Windsor, who is patron of the FUNdation, said she hoped the duck stunt would encourage people to come up with their own ideas. 'We now want people to send us their own entries of wacky things they'd like to do, and we'll provide funding for the best ones.'

"A specialist team of rescuers have recovered the bodies of two men after a helicopter crashed at the bottom of a cliff in Yorkshire, Humberside police have confirmed. The AB206B helicopter was flying from Edinburgh to Humberside Airport when it crashed close to cliffs at Flamborough Head in Yorkshire at around 1.30pm. The aircraft was 30 mintues from Humberside where it was due to refuel before continuing to Retford, Nottinghamshire. A photograph on Twitter claims to show the aircraft, which is flying low over the sea, ten minutes before the accident. Scroll down for video . A photograph claiming to show the helicopter ten minutes before the crash was published on Twitter last night. The aircraft in the photograph is shown flying low beneath heavy cloud above the sea . The AB206B Jet Ranger II aircraft, pictured, took off this morning from Edinburgh and was due to refuel in Hull before continuing to Retford, Nottinghamshire before it crashed into a cliff in Flamborough Head in Yorkshire . Police confirmed that the bodies of two men were recovered from the scene of the crash at Flamborough Head, Yorkshire shortly before 5pm . Eyewitnesses said the pilot appeared to be heading for an emergency landing near a cliff top when the helicopter’s engine failed, causing it to plummet more than 200ft.RAF rescuers were on the scene within minutes. Both men on board were confirmed dead at around 5pm and their bodies recovered. Barry Rhodes, 71, was playing golf on a course just yards from the sea when he ‘spotted a helicopter that seemed to be in a bit of bother’. He added: ‘It looked as though it was coming in to land on the cliff top. But as it did, there was a loud screech and then the engine cut out. ‘The helicopter just dropped to the ground at speed ... it hit the bottom of the cliff that meets with the sea. It was the most horrific thing I have ever seen.’ Greenkeeper Scott Cooper said: ‘It started to splutter and sway, and I thought the pilot was trying to make a landing but it didn’t make it. ‘We couldn’t see a great deal over the cliffs but a few bits of the helicopter, and there was a very strong smell of fuel. It was awful.’ Brian Vickers, 68 from Selby on . holiday in Flamborough said: 'I saw the helicopter fly past our cottage . far too low. I knew it was in trouble. 'I . followed it to the edge of the cliff and saw it go on its side. It . disappeared below the cliff and I knew it had gone down. It all went . quiet. There was no noise from any impact. The rescue services were here . within minutes.' The . aircraft is a Augusta Bell AB206B Jet Ranger II. The single-engined . helicopter was built in Italy in 1978 and had flown for more than 14,000 . hours. It is . understood that the aircraft was flying under visual flight rules which . means the pilot must be able to see the ground at all times. The . wreckage  was found at the base of the 250 foot cliff. Volunteers from . the RNLI recovered parts of the helicopter from the sea near the crash . site. Air Accident Investigators will consider whether the low cloud base this morning in the area of the crash site was a factor in the crash. Searchers began the task of recovering the wreckage and trying to determine the cause of crash . Both victims, who have not yet been named, were recovered from the scene shortly before 5pm . The RNLI, pictured, assisted the RAF and Coastguard in today's rescue and recovery operation . Humberside Police said: 'The helicopter, which had two men on board at the time, was a private charter which had taken off from an airfield near Edinburgh earlier this morning heading to its final destination near Retford. 'Emergency services including the Air Ambulance, the Coast Guard and Air Sea  Rescue attended the area right away and a search was carried out which resulted in the helicopter being located in the sea off the coast of Flamborough near the light house. 'Two men were recovered from the aircraft shortly before 1700hrs. Both sadly deceased. 'The Air Accident Investigation Branch will be leading the investigation into the incident to establish the circumstances which resulted in the aircraft crashing into the sea. 'Again, members of public and the media are asked to avoid the area which is sealed off until further notice due to the site being close to dangerous cliff  edges and there also being a quantity of what appears to be aviation fuel in the water around the crash site making it potentially unsafe at present.' The bodies of the pilot and his passenger were recovered from the scene after Ministry of Defence firemen equipped with specialist cutters removed them from the wreckage. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) launched two volunteer crews from Flamborough and Bridlington to assist in the rescue and later recovery operation. Chris Feast, from Flamborough Head Golf Club, said a number of golfers had spotted a helicopter trying to land near the 17th green and then reported hearing a 'loud bang and crash' The aircraft, which was on a private flight from Edinburgh to Nottinghamshire, crashed close to cliffs at Flamborough Head, at around 1.30pm - sparking a major search operation . A spokeswoman said: 'Flamborough . RNLI’s Atlantic 85 inshore lifeboat launched at 1.45pm, followed soon . after by Bridlington RNLI all-weather lifeboat. The volunteer crews . spent some time searching an area in Selwicks Bay and later stood by at . sea to support coastguard, fire and rescue and other emergency service . colleagues in the rescue operation.' Flamborough . RNLI crew member Cole Ibbotson said: 'We could see the wreckage of the . helicopter at the bottom of the cliff and could see where it had hit. The swell was too big for the lifeboat to get in close so we were tasked . to undertake a search pattern for wreckage with Bridlington all-weather . lifeboat. We recovered a number of items which we have passed on to the . police. 'We are all devastated that this service didn't have a . positive outcome and that we couldn't help the people on board the . helicopter. Our thoughts and sympathy are very much with their family . and friends tonight.' It is believed a search has located the helicopter in the sea off the coast of Flamborough near the lighthouse . The two RNLI lifeboats crews were stood down at 5.45pm. The commercial director of Humberside . Airport, Paul Litten, said: 'At the time of the crash the aircraft was . just at the tip of our space and was just leaving Durham Tees. 'The . flight was still about 30 to 40 minutes away from our airport. The . helicopter was due here to refuel and then take off again on its journey . to his further destination. We do not know where the helicopter was . heading to. 'Over the course . of a weekend we do get a lot of flights taking advantage of the . Humberside coastline but we do not know whether the flight was business . or pleasure. 'Unless a flight is an external one we do not know who is onboard or how many are onboard. 'We can get flights coming in to us 30, 40, 50 times a day. This is not something unusual. Fortunately, . accidents like this in the UK are rare. Our thoughts are with the . families at this time, we can only hope for a positive outcome but it is . looking more like it may not be.' Lifeboats from Bridlington and Flamborough launched shortly after 1.30pm and the Yorkshire Air Ambulance has arrived at the scene . A fisherman who was in the area today said the weather was poor at the time of the crash. The . fisherman, who did not want to be named, said: 'I was out on the water . this morning and it was very foggy, bad conditions. I don’t know if that . played a part but the conditions were bad. 'All I’ve heard is that a helicopter went down this afternoon, about half a mile from the lighthouse, it’s right off the cliff. 'My . mate, who’s been talking to one of the lifeboat crew, told me there had . been two bodies pulled from the helicopter, with potentially a third.' Chris . Feast, from Flamborough Head Golf Club, said a number of golfers had . spotted a helicopter trying to land near the 17th green and then . reported hearing a 'loud bang and crash'. Police, Coastguard and ambulance service are on the scene as the rescue efforts continue . The AB206B aircraft was built in 1978 and had flown more than 14,116 hours . Paul Litten, commercial director for Humberside airport, said: 'This was a private flight from Durham Tees Valley and was due to arrive with our air traffic controllers later this afternoon. 'Police and the coast guard are dealing with the emergency. 'I knew it was due in and heard that an aircraft emergency had been called. Our  thoughts are with the people on board.' Leila Ann Evans said she saw the helicopter just 10 minutes before it crashed near Flamborough, Yorkshire . Lifeboats from Bridlington and Flamborough launched shortly afterwards and the Yorkshire Air Ambulance has arrived at the scene. Eye-witness Chris Palmer said he heard a loud 'crack' and the helicopter disappeared out of sight behind the cliffs. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'We heard the helicopter. It was like a white, private helicopter going along the coast. 'We all heard this really loud crack and looked up again. The helicopter started to descend, almost like a plane when it lands. 'It then went behind the cliff and that’s when I called the emergency services. I never actually heard it hit the sea.' Eyewitness Rod Marwood, course chairman at Flamborough Head Golf Club, said: 'I didn't see all of it as it was all over within 10 seconds. 'I only saw the helicopter disappearing below the cliff. 'We heard a change in the engine and it went. We thought it would reappear but never did. 'People who were closer said there was a flurry of engine activity in an attempt to try and get it back up in their air but it was futile. 'It's like a 250ft sheer drop from the cliff top straight into the sea with a few ledges on the way down.'","Helicopter crashed close to cliffs at Flamborough Head, East Yorkshire .

"The suspect has been identified as 31-year-old Eric Matthew Frein, of Canadensis, Pennsylvania . The suspect who shot two troopers outside a rural barracks is a survivalist who has expressed a desire to kill law enforcement officers and commit mass murder, according to Pennsylvania State Police. Matthew Frein, 31, of Canadensis, Pennsylvania was identified as the suspect by State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan. He lives about 20 miles from Blooming Grove Barracks in Pike County that were attacked on Friday, leaving one trooper dead and another wounded. Noonan says about 200 law enforcement officials are looking for Frein, but his whereabouts are unknown. He said Frein is considered armed and 'extremely dangerous.' 'He has made statements about wanting to kill law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder,' Noonan said. 'What his reasons are, we don't know. But he has very strong feelings about law enforcement and seems to be very angry with a lot of things that go on in our society.' Frein was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder, homicide of a law enforcement officer and other offenses. About 200 law enforcement officials are combing the rural area of northeastern Pennsylvania marked by dense forest, but 'we have no idea where he is,' Noonan said. Cpl. Bryon Dickson (right) was killed and Trooper Alex Douglass (left) was critically wounded outside a state police barracks in northeastern Pennsylvania on Friday night . A gunman killed Cpl. Bryon Dickson, 38, and critically wounded Trooper Alex Douglass outside the barracks during a late-night shift change, then slipped away. Authorities were led to Frein after a resident who was walking his dog in a wooded area two miles from the barracks spotted a vehicle slightly submerged in a pond and called 911. In the vehicle, police found shell casings that matched those found at the shooting scene, Noonan said. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett leaves the Geisinger Community Medical Center  after a brief visit with wounded Pennsylvania State Trooper Alex T. Douglass . Investigators also found Frein's Social Security card, a Pennsylvania Game Commission range permit, camouflage face paint, a black hooded sweatshirt, two empty rifle cases and military gear, Noonan said. The developments come as a nonprofit group offered a $50,000 reward for tips about Friday's deadly assault at the remote post in northeast Pennsylvania. Dickson, a seven-year veteran, had transferred to the region from the Philadelphia barracks several months ago. Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said the 'cowardly attack' was directed at state police and a 'very dangerous, armed criminal' eluded quick capture. A Pennsylvania State Trooper walks into a wooded area as investigators return to scour the woods across the street from the state police barracks . 'Our troopers were ... shot without warning and really had no chance to defend themselves,' Noonan told reporters Saturday afternoon. 'It has touched us to the core that such a thing could happen' 'Our troopers were ... shot without warning and really had no chance to defend themselves,' Noonan told reporters Saturday afternoon. 'It has touched us to the core that such a thing could happen.' Law enforcement officers from at least three states on Saturday searched state game lands surrounding the barracks in Pike County and beyond. 'There has been an exhaustive search conducted by hundreds of members of law enforcement,' said Lt. Colonel George Bivens. 'We have canvassed the wooded areas, neighborhoods. We are convinced this individual is no longer in that immediate area.' The slain trooper was married with two young sons. He was described by friends as devoted to work and family. They were a committed couple,' Melissa Contorno, a friend of Dickson's wife, told The Times-Tribune. 'They were raising a beautiful young family. It's not fair.'

"A  man thought to have died of Ebola in the middle of a Liberian street was discovered to still be alive when funeral workers arrived to pick up his body. The unnamed 37-year-old is said to have been dying from the virus in the open air for several days but ambulance workers in the capital Monrovia refused to treat him, local community leaders said. Finally, following days without medical attention, the man stopped moving and funeral workers were called - although while preparing to take him for burial they noticed he was trying to move his arms. The realistion that the man was still alive prompted cheers from the large crowd of onlookers, who then had to plead with paramedics to take the man for treatment at the hospital. Scroll down for video . Care: Thinking the man (pictured background, beneath blanket) had already died, ABC News reporter Dr Richard Besser was filming a piece to camera about the way the victim had not been given medical attention . 'He's alive': A burial team arrived and began spraying the unnamed man - who had been covered by a blanket - with  bleach. As they put hid 'body' on a stretcher, one worker noticed the man was moving his arms . Not dead: Although incredibly weak, the man could clearly be seen moving his arms to indicate he was still alive . Joy: The realistion that the man was still alive prompted cheers from the large crowd of onlookers, who then had to plead with paramedics to take the man for treatment at the hospital . The incident occurred earlier this week in an Ebola-ravaged section of the Liberian capital Monrovia and was captured on video by ABC News. Thinking the man had already died, reporter Dr Richard Besser was filming a piece to camera, having spoken to several community leaders about the way the victim had been abandoned without medical treatment for several days. While the item was being recorded, a burial team arrived and began spraying the man - who had been covered by a blanket - with disinfectant and bleach. Minutes later, as they started lifting him onto a stretcher to be placed in a mortuary vehicle, one of the funeral workers noticed he was still moving and a cry of 'He's alive' rang out. A large crowd of onlookers then broke into cheers and applause, although the realisation initially had little impact other than the burial team dumping the critically ill man back on the floor and driving off. An ambulance was called and this time arrived within 10 minutes, with locals pleading with paramedics to ensure the man was transported to a hospital in the hope he could be saved. Dying: The realisation that the man was still alive initially had little impact other than to convince the burial team to take the critically ill man off their stretcher and dump him back on the street . Reluctant: An ambulance  arrived within 10 minutes, but locals had to plead with paramedics through the vehicle's window to ensure the man was finally transported to a hospital . At last: Ambulance workers eventually put the critically ill man on a stretcher and took him to hospital . Hope: The reason it was difficult to get the dying man the medical care he so desperately needed is due to a chronic shortage of hospital beds for Ebola victims in the virus-ravaged Liberian capital Monrovia . The sick man's current state of health is not known, but Dr Besser said he appeared so ill that it seems unlikely he would have been able to cling on to life for much longer than a few more hours. He said the reason it had proven so difficult to get him the medical care he so desperately needed is due to a chronic shortage of hospital beds for Ebola victims in virus-ravaged Monrovia. On the other hand, there is still plenty of space at Liberia's cemeteries and crematoriums, which is why the burial team were more than happy to pick up what they thought was the man's corpse within a hour of him being reported dead. The news comes as an American woman was confined to her Dallas apartment under armed guard after a man infected with Ebola stayed at her home . Louise Troh said Thursday that she is tired of being locked up and wants federal health authorities to decontaminate her home, adding that she never imagined this could happen to her so far from disease-ravaged West Africa. Authorities say the circle of people in the U.S. possibly exposed to Ebola widened after the man - who arrived from Liberia last month - was discharged from hospital without being tested for the virus. An American cameraman helping to cover the Ebola outbreak in Liberia for NBC News has tested positive for the virus and will be flown back to the United States for treatment. NBC News President Deborah Turness said Thursday the rest of the NBC News crew including medical correspondent Dr. Nancy Snyderman will be flown back to the U.S. and placed in quarantine for 21 days 'in an abundance of caution.' The freelance cameraman has been working in Liberia for three years for Vice News and other media outlets, and has been covering the Ebola epidemic. He began shooting for NBC on Tuesday. The network is withholding his name at his family's request. He began feeling tired and achy Wednesday and discovered he had a slight fever. He went to a treatment center Thursday to be tested, and is being kept there, said Snyderman, who was interviewed Thursday night on 'The Rachel Maddow Show' on MSNBC. Snyderman said she believes his exposure to the virus happened sometime before he started working with the NBC crew, since it is usually eight to 10 days before the first symptoms are seen.","Unnamed 37-year-old had been left dying on a Monrovia street for days .

"After suffering a major decline during the recession six years ago, luxury air travel is taking off again as legacy carriers introduce extravagant ‘apartments in the sky’ and more first class seats to lure wealthy travellers. And it appears a new age of aviation glamour has arrived with a recent study revealing a sharp increase in the number of first class seats on flights in the wake of the economic downturn. An analysis by aviation data company OAG shows a 34 per cent jump in first class seats on planes departing in 2014 compared with 2009, when many analysts predicted the end of first class seating. Scroll down for video . Etihad Airways' fleet of Airbus A380 aircraft boast first class apartments that offer plenty of privacy for wealthy travellers . Lap of luxury: Etihad Airways' £12,500 high-end suite, known as The Residence, is sold out for the first ten flights . Comfort: Singapore Airlines is spending £200m to overhaul its first class cabins on its fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft . According to the study, the total number of first class seats has increased by 34 per cent, with huge growth in Asia . According to the study, which was carried out for the Financial Times, there has been a resurgence in Europe, where the number of first class seats in 2014 has doubled in the last decade. There were approximately one million in 2005 and the number has rebounded to more than two million after a sharp decline between 2005 and 2009, the study found. In Asia alone, the growth of first class seating has been enormous – from 8.5 million seats in 2005 to 12.6 million in 2009 and 26.7 million this year. Personal space: These first class seats feature a wall that can be raised for additional privacy . Each first class apartment on Etihad's A380 fleet is equipped with a 24-inch TV and a wide armchair and ottoman which open into a bed . China and the Middle East have seen the biggest gains, while there have been cutbacks in Europe, according to the study. Emirates, for example, has increased its first class seats by 32 per cent as British Airways has cut its capacity by 23 per cent. Worldwide, there are more than 86 million first class seats on all flights, up from 57.5 million in 2005 and 64.1 million in 2009. Seats in British Airways’ first class cabins fold into a fully flat bed that measures nearly seven feet in length . British Airways has cut its first class cabin capacity by 23 per cent since 2009, according to a recent study . First class is experiencing a renaissance as airlines launch the most luxurious cabins ever seen and well-to-do passengers are eager to splash thousands of pounds to fly in the lap of luxury. The Residence, a three-room flat with a Savoy-trained butler and in-flight chef on Etihad Airways’ new Airbus A380 fleet, is the most opulent of them all. Despite the £12,500 price tag for a one-way flight in The Residence, the super-rich are snapping up tickets. Earlier this month, the Gulf carrier announced that it has sold out for the initial ten flights between Abu Dhabi and London Heathrow Airport. Despite the £12,500 price tag for a one-way flight in Etihad Airways' The Residence, the super-rich are snapping up tickets . First of its kind: The Residence boasts a double bedroom, living room and an en-suite shower room . Modern travel: A look inside the first class cabin, which is divided into 'apartments' For those who find the one-way price of The Residence too steep, they can opt for a First Apartment in the first class section. Etihad’s First Apartments may not come with a personal concierge or chef, but they do offer privacy in a much smaller space. The compartments are upholstered with Poltrona Frau leather with a wide armchair and ottoman which opens into a bed measuring 81 inches. And each one is equipped with an adjustable 24-inch flat screen TV, a vanity cabinet with lighting and space for personal effects, a chilled mini-bar and a wardrobe. Worldwide, there are more than 86 million first class seats on all flights, up from 57.5 million in 2005 and 64.1 million in 2009 . In response to growing competition from the east, Air France launched its new first class cabin, La Premiere, two months ago . First class travellers are treated to fine dining and plenty of booze while relaxing in spacious cabins . Airlines are pushing the boundaries and spending heavily on new cabins amid rising demand and growing competition, and it’s a situation that no one could have predicted when the recession hit. In response to growing competition from the east, Air France launched its new first class cabin, La Premiere, two months ago. Nigel Goode, director of PriestmanGoode, which has designed first class cabins for Qatar Airways, Swiss, Lufthansa and Air France, told the Financial Times: ‘Everyone thinks first class must be diminishing, but it’s quite incredible how more and more airlines are renewing their first class offer and having more first class seats on board.

"It has been an exercise in diplomacy and stealth – a careful negotiation of appearance and reality which can only be revealed now. Over the past seven days the FBI, the law enforcement services of Dale County and Mobile, Alabama, the State Patrol and Sheriff’s office have combined to mount an operation under intense scrutiny – with intense secrecy. And for the past seven days the assembled media have abided by the FBI’s requests to maintain that secrecy and to leave unreported the movements of materials and manpower we have witnessed - to ensure that Jimmy Lee Dykes, who had access to TV and internet in his underground bunker, did not learn of their plans or get spooked by the growing force around him. FBI agents built a mock bunker nearby the scene to work out how best to conduct the raid. Military surveillance equipment - including a camera that was delicately inserted into the bunker - and personnel were used during the standoff. Ready to go: These heavily-armed agents with the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team gear up with equipment delivered in a Budget rental truck . Moving out: The federal agents were always at the ready and prepared to storm the bunker where little Ethan was being held . Heavy equipment: The FBI brought in numerous trucks, as well as helicopters, bomb detectors and sophisticated surveillance equipment . CNN correspondent Barbara Starr reports that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta personally approved the FBI using its gear and engineers during the operations. A citadel of surveillance has been erected – all unreported until now, all as negotiators hoped for a peaceful outcome. However, it was the FBI's elite Hostage Rescue Team, and not U.S. troops that, that stormed the bunker and recused five-year-old Ethan. Within hours of survivalist Jimmy Lee Dikes’ shooting of school bus driver Charles ‘Chuck’ Poland and his abduction of the boy, the FBI became involved. With their arrival came an abrupt shut down of communications. Safe: Little Ethan, age 5, is safe after he was taken hostage last Tuesday by Jimmy Lee Dykes and held in an underground bunker for several days . Dead: Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, the hostage-taker, died in the FBI raid on his bunker . On the first call to the scene on Tuesday afternoon the local officers called upon assistance from neighbouring Houston County. An . alarm went out to all local emergency services locally and, as one fire . officer speaking to MailOnline, said ‘It was like everything was lit . up. Then the FBI got involved and “boom” everything went quiet.’ For the first four hours on that first day a local police lieutenant spoke with Dykes. He lay on the grass and spoke down the PVC pipe that emerged from the ground as the only sign of the bunker beneath. As the situation dragged on, that pipe became the only means of passing supplies of medicine, toys and treats to the little boy below. Local officers remained the ones who made the perilous trip through Dykes’s compound to deliver Ethan’s medicine – he suffers from ADHD and mild autism – as, according to one Houston County source, ‘They figured that they’d managed to walk the path there before without getting blown up so they might as well keep doing it.’ In truth, it seems unlikely that the FBI’s reasoning was quite that casual. But they did fear that Dykes’s had rigged the bunker and the land surrounding it with explosives. As well as knowing that Dykes had a gun, neighbours told officers that they believed he had pipe bombs. On the second day sniffer dogs were brought in trained in detecting explosives. The land was x-rayed and a decision made not to lower any sort of wire, or camera into the bunker as a result. Among the first request made by Dykes was that a reporter be brought in to tell his story. MailOnline has learned that his repeated and particular request was for ‘four minutes on all the major TV networks’ to tell what Sherriff Wally Olson described as ‘a complex story.’ The side track leading to the small neighbourhood in which Dykes lived and in which he dug out his final resting place, was closed off to all but residents who were checked in and out by guards. Guarded: This is a glimpse of the property where Dykes was holed up in an underground bunker he had dug himself . Eyes in the sky: Helicopters circled the sky around the bunker as the FBI closed in on Monday . On Saturday there was a marked increase of agency presence. Two tactical vehicles arrived on the scene and parked in the dust across the road from the assembled press. The silver trailers bore the FBI emblem and initials. A large black mobile Crime Scene Unit was slowly driven up to the edge of the large barn at the crest of the hill behind which the bunker lay. Heavily armed Hostage Rescue Teams were seen moving up on either side of that barn – tracking round the back and out of view. The impression as each day passed was of a man well and truly surrounded and, though Dykes had access to television and Internet in his subterranean bunker, completely in the dark. As negotiators changed shifts, their . handovers visible between 3 and 4pm each day, no significant news . emerged other than the fact of their ongoing negotiations. Far and wide: Federal agents traveled to Alabama from across the country, and Alabama police came in from across the state . Working together: Law enforcement officials from the FBI, the Dale county Sheriff's Office and the Alabama State Police all collaborated on the standoff . On Friday evening a plane landed on the outskirts of the local airport and was met on the tarmac by a fleet of Budget Rental Vans. Equipment was unloaded. By Saturday morning those vans were parked up the sidetrack next to the barn. Bit by bit as the net closed – as firepower descended and electronic surveillance watched – the official message, which was delivered with the knowledge that Dykes was watching, was that authorities were grateful to him for caring for Ethan. But the moment they felt he no longer was, they were ready. For the first time in a long time Dykes, disturbed and paranoid, may have believed he was in charge. But at 3.12 on Monday afternoon that final delusion proved his undoing. Special Agent Bomb Technicians continue to clear the scene and only after their work is done will Evidence Response Teams move into process the scene.","FBI brought in its elite Hostage Rescue Teams and sophisticated equipment .

"Shy bladder sufferers have condemned a DirecTV advert that uses a 'painfully awkward' Rob Lowe who cannot urinate in public restrooms to encourage viewers to switch from cable. In the campaign, the 50-year-old actor plays two characters: a handsome Lowe in a slick suit who is a satellite customer and a goofy-looking Lowe who is a cable user. In one scene, the latter character is filmed standing awkwardly at a urinal with two other men. Unlike his doppelganger's formal attire, he is donning a fanny pack with his hair parted in the middle. In response to the other Lowe's remark that cable TV makes subscribers wait, he states: 'Fact. I can't go with other people in the room', before unsuccessfully trying to urinate.

DirecTV, a satellite service provider based in El Segundo, California, claims viewers should be able to take the advert in the humorous way in which it was intended. But a shy bladder group has lambasted the company, saying the advert ridicules a serious issue in America, where around seven per cent of people have some form of 'shy bladder syndrome'. Steve Soifer, CEO of the International Paruresis Association and a social work professor at the University of Memphis, said he didn't mind if 'people have a little fun' with the condition. But he added: 'It's a situation that a lot of people don't understand. In this particular case, the portrayal is making it look ridiculous, that this guy is a loser for having a problem.

Are you going to make fun of them?' Since the campaign's launch in late October, members of the Association have written to DirecTV asking for the advert to be removed. But Darris Gringeri, spokesman for DirecTV, said the service will not be fulfilling their request. 'The ads will continue to run for the vast majority of viewers who have told us they enjoy the spots and understand that, like all of our commercials, they take place in a fantasy world and are not based in reality,' he said.

"The boyfriend of murdered landscape architect Joanna Yeates has spoken of his heartache at losing her - nearly a year after she was found murdered on Christmas Day. Greg Reardon, 28, told for the first time how the couple would probably have married one day. Miss Yeates's body was found by dog walkers on a snowy verge in Failand, near Bristol, last Christmas Day. In October, the couple's neighbour Vincent Tabak was jailed for life for killing her. Happy together: Greg Reardon (left) faces Christmas without his beloved girlfriend Joanna Yeates (right) as the one-year anniversary of her murder approaches . Life partners: Mr Reardon said he and the landscape architect would probably have got married one day . During Tabak's trial, the jury heard he strangled Miss Yeates, 25, in a violent confrontation at the flat she shared with Mr Reardon in Clifton, Bristol. He then span a web of lies and deceit to cover his tracks - taking her body back to his flat, then going shopping in Asda with her in his car boot. Within an hour, he had dumped her partially clothed corpse on the verge and just 24 hours later was drinking champagne with friends. During the trial, it emerged Tabak was obsessed with images of women being strangled during sex. Mr . Reardon met Miss Yeates in 2008 after they both started working for the . BDP architecture firm in Bristol. He described her as modest, . conscientious and laid-back. Heartache: A policeman stands guard outside the flat Mr Reardon and Miss Yeates shared in Bristol at the height of the murder investigation last Christmas . Frozen in time: A cat bowl in the flat as it appeared on the day Miss Yeates was murdered. Mr Reardon found the property empty when he returned after a weekend away. He panicked when he called Joanna's mobile and heard it ringing in her coat pocket . In an interview with The Sun, he said: 'The thought of proposing had crossed my mind although it was probably some time off. 'It was more about taking things one step at a time and seeing where life took us than having a 'five-year plan' or whatever. 'My mum and dad were very proud of me for finding such a nice girl.' He said he and Miss Yeates, who was a landscape architect, were planning to spend Christmas with her parents David and Theresa in Hampshire. Mr Reardon was visiting his brother in Sheffield when Tabak murdered his girlfriend. Killer: Tabak strangled Miss Yeates and dumped her body on a snow-covered verge . He had said during the trial how he . was not instantly concerned when he came back to find the flat empty, . but started to panic when he called her mobile and heard it ringing in her . coat pocket. When he found her glasses, purse and keys, he realised something was seriously wrong. He said: 'At the first police press . conference on the Tuesday, when I saw all the cameras I just thought, . ""I've seen this type of story before. I know how it's going to end"".' He said he cursed 'the probability of the situation more than anything'. 'Why couldn't we win the lottery . instead?"" he added. 'It's probably just as feasible as getting murdered . by your next-door neighbour.' The 28-year-old was praised, along with Miss Yeates's family, by police for his dignity during Tabak's trial. He told The Sun he felt a huge release of tension after the trial and was glad of the result. Mr Reardon, who has returned to work and has bought a flat in Bristol, said he still visits Miss Yeates's grave. He said: 'I'm not sure specifically what I'll do to remember Jo in the future, but I'm certainly not going to forget her.'

"Australian supermodel Robyn Lawley has accused the modelling industry of promoting starvation, calling the pressure to be thin 'messed up'. In an interview with Marie Claire, the 25-year-old beauty revealed the struggle to maintain her weight and the high expectations of the culture of fashion. At 188cm, Lawley was introduced to the modelling world early on, pushed into auditioning for an agency by one of her three sisters. 'When I became a teenager... everyone started suggesting it because I was tall and that's what tall girls do, I suppose,' she said.

At 188cm, Lawley was introduced to the modelling world early on, pushed into auditioning for an agency by one of her three sisters. 'When I became a teenager... everyone started suggesting it because I was tall and that's what tall girls do, I suppose,' Lawley said . 'I was really into fashion, so I knew models were about half the size I was. When I went to see the agencies, my weight was always an issue so I took it upon myself to start losing it. After a few years, the size 12 model began to realise the detrimental effect the industry standards were having on not only her, but her friends. 'I had a moment when I was about 16, one of my Russian model friends was painfully thin and we went to a cafe after a casting. I was trying not to eat at the time, but I was really struggling,' Lawley said. 'I just got a salad [but] she didn't eat anything. I thought it was just so messed up. I was worried about her health.' Unwilling to compromise her health, Lawley quit the industry. It took her many years to realise she could model without harming her physical or emotional health. 'I just see no reason in any labels really, I just want women [to be] happy with their bodies,' Lawley said . Unwilling to compromise her health, Lawley quit the industry. It took her many years to realise she could model without harming her physical or emotional health. 'It was really hard to have that extra pressure to lose, not just a little amount of weight, but a lot. I had a lot of issues with it,' she said. '[Many models] get measured when they go into an agency, and if they gain weight, they are out. People don't understand what starvation can do to you, it wreaks havoc with your brain.' Lawley was the first 'plus size' model for Ralph Lauren, but isn't comfortable with the term, and is passionate about promoting healthy body image among young women. 'I can see the ramifications on young women if their body is similar or larger than mine and they see a 'plus size' label,’ she recently told Daily Mail Australia. Lawley was signed last year to brand Mango to front their plus-size range Violetta, but is irritated that the modelling industry labels her and other 'plus sizers' as niche.

"A 'glowing' Chelsea Clinton has shared the first picture of her baby daughter Charlotte after giving birth to her yesterday evening. She posted the picture of herself cradling newborn Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, with her husband Marc Mezvinsky standing lovingly behind her and staring down at his daughter. Chelsea's announcement was quickly followed by a photograph of Charlotte meeting her grandparents Bill and Hillary Clinton, who posted pictures saying they 'couldn't be happier' and were 'over the moon'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'We are in love': Chelsea Clinton posted this picture of her holding Charlotte with new father Marc Mezvinsky standing behind her . 'Over the moon': Proud grandmother Hillary Clinton shared this picture today to celebrate Charlotte's birth . New grandparents: A jubilant Bill Clinton posted this picture of himself, Charlotte and Hillary together shortly after Chelsea shared her first photograph . The former Preisdent had earlier spoken of his joy at becoming and grandfather and said his daughter was 'glowing'. Chelsea's post, shared with her 629,000 followers, also revealed that the time she gave birth to Charlotte was 7.03pm yesterday. She wrote: 'At 7:03 PM on September 26th, we finally met Charlotte. We’re in love.' Chelsea, 34, whose husband is investment banker Marc Mezvinsky, announced the news online at midnight on Friday - four days before the expected due date. She said: 'Marc and I are full of love, awe and gratitude as we celebrate the birth of our daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky.' It's a girl! Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky have celebrated the birth of their first child Charlotte . And hours after the news became public, President Clinton made his own announcement, describing the new parents as 'glowing' and 'bursting with pride'. He said: 'We are blessed, grateful, and so happy to be the grandparents of a beautiful girl, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, born on Friday evening, September 26, 2014. 'We are thrilled to be with our daughter and her husband as they welcome their daughter into the world. 'Chelsea is well and glowing. Marc is bursting with pride. Charlotte's life is off to a good start.' Bill and his wife Hillary, who have gushed at length about their excitement at a number of public speaking events in the past few months, both reposted their daughter's announcement, made on her Twitter page. Breaking the news: Chelsea said she is 'full of love, awe and gratitude' four days before her expected due date . Chelsea was last seen on Wednesday afternoon at the annual Clinton Global Initiative summit in New York's Sheraton Hotel, where she had been on her feet for three days straight. Despite resigning from her position as a specialist reporter for NBC in April, the former First Daughter, who was educated at Stanford, Oxford and Columbia universities, continued to work full-time for the Clinton Foundation up until she gave birth. News of the birth will come as welcome news to supporters hoping Hillary Clinton will run for president since the former First Lady said she would wait until she became a grandmother before launching a second nomination bid. A spokesman for the new parents, Kamyl Bazbaz, confirmed Clinton had the child on Friday. As a result of the birth, new grandfather Bill has bowed out of a scheduled appearance to lend a hand to a pair of embattled Democratic candidates in Colorado. Clinton was to speak at a fundraiser Saturday for Sen. Mark Udall. Gov. John Hickenlooper was also scheduled to be at the event. Both Democrats are locked in tight re-election battles with their Republican challengers. He has been travelling around the country to help the party this year. On Tuesday, Chelsea appeared on CNN with her growing baby bump as she revealed they had decided not to find out the gender of their first child until the birth as they wanted it to be a surprise. 'There are so few mysteries in life…any answer is a happy one,' Clinton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Tuesday. 'So my husband and I decided that we would enjoy this mystery for the nine-plus months that we're granted, and we are eager to find out what God will have given us.' The name Charlotte dates back to the 1700s, and means 'freedom'. It has long been a favourite among royals and political dynasties, and last year it was the 11th most popular girl names  in the United States. Surprise! Chelsea and Marc elected not to find out the gender of their first child advance . The couple, who married in July 2010, announced that they were expecting their first child in April. Chelsea and Marc never revealed the due date, sparking rife speculation in the last few weeks as her bump grew. On Sunday, Chelsea stepped out with her husband wearing a fitted white T-shirt that showed off her baby bump, accessorizing the look with a gold strand necklace. The parents-to-be held hands as they strolled down the street on their way to a political event at New York's Gotham Bar and Grill. And the rumour-mill was sent spinning when Bill Clinton, who served as the 42nd US president between January 1993 and January 2001, revealed to CNN that the baby would come by next month. During the television interview, the former U.S. President said: 'I hope by the first of October, I'll be a grandfather.' Last week, Hillary Clinton also excited fans as she told a crowd at political steak fry in Indianola, Iowa: 'Bill and I are on constant grandchild watch. So don't be surprised if we suddenly go sprinting off the stage. 'I want to babysit any chance I get,' she added. When Chelsea announced her pregnancy during a Clinton Foundation event devoted to empowering young women, she told guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year. 'I certainly feel all the better whether it's a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled with so many strong, young female leaders,' she added. 'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.' Aspirations: For Bill and Hillary Clinton, their dream to become grandparents has come true . Bill Clinton has achieved many of his political aspirations, while for Hillary, there are still more to come. But for the couple, one of the dreams they have never kept a secret has finally come true - they are grandparents. In recent years they have often gushed over their desire to have grandchildren while their daughter Chelsea has mentioned her need to reassure her mother she would one day have a child. The former president was the first to speak of his ambitions for an extended family. During a conference in Vienna in July 2010, where he spoke about his bucket list, he said: 'What I'd really like to do, if I could have my wishes, I would like to live to see my own grandchildren.' Two months letter during an appearance on the David Letterman Show after Chelsea's marriage to Marc, he added: 'Hillary wanted this marriage because she wants to be a grandmother more than she wanted to be president.' Speaking in the March 2011 issue of Harper's Bazaar, the ex-Secretary of State admitted that she'd probably be an 'unbearable' grandmother, but she'd 'love' her daughter to have children. She said of the suggestion: 'Well, no pressure, because I don't want to be one of those kinds of mothers. But obviously, someday, I'd love it.' However, in an interview in Davos the same year her husband suggested there may have been more pressure than first thought. 'I'd like to be a grandfather ... I would like to have a happy wife, and she won't be unless she's a grandmother,' he said. In September 2013, during an appearance on 'CBS This Morning', Bill was asked whether his wife would prefer to be a grandmother or elected to the White House. 'If you ask her, I think she'd say grandmother, but I have found it best not to discuss that issue. My goal is to be a grandfather. The rest is out of my hands.' During an appearance on the Racheal Ray show in 2003, Chelsea spoke about her diplomatic parents' 'unapologetic desire' for a grandchild. 'They would tell you without blinking an eye that it would make them the happiest thing on earth if I were to make them grandparents,' she said. She added that she and Marc had decided to make 2014 the 'Year of the Baby' and urged the presenter: 'Please, call my mother and tell her that. She asks us about it every single day.' Bill even became a vegan because he 'wanted to see his grandkids grow up' He adopted a 'plant-based' diet about five or six years ago, according to Dr Dean Ornish, a physician consultant to Bill Clinton and an adviser to Hillary Clinton for more than 20 years. 'I asked him why... and he said, 'I want to live long enough to walk my daughter down the aisle and to see my grandkids born and grow up,'' the consulting physician told the Huffington Post. When Chelsea announced the pregnancy earlier his year, the couple took to Twitter to share their excitement. Hillary wrote: 'My most exciting title yet: Grandmother-To-Be! @billclinton and I are thrilled that Chelsea and Marc are expecting their first child!' Husband Bill echoed her words, saying: 'Excited to add a new line to my Twitter bio...grandfather-to-be! @hillaryclinton and I are so happy for Chelsea and Marc!'","Chelsea Clinton, 34, gave birth at 7.03pm last night in Manhattan hospital .

"Passed: Nobel Literature laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, seen here in March as he greeted fans and reporters outside his home on his 87th birthday in Mexico City, died on Thursday at his home in Mexico City. Author Gabriel Garcia Marquez has died at his home in Mexico at the age of 87. The Colombian Nobel Literature laureate is considered one of the greatest Spanish- language writers of all time, best-known for his masterpiece One Hundred Years of Solitude. During his career he achieved literary celebrity which spawned comparisons to Mark Twain and Charles Dickens. Last night Barack Obama was among the many to pay tribute to Garcia Marquez – known as ‘Gabo’ to his friends. The US President said the world had lost ‘one of its greatest visionary writers’, adding that he  cherished an inscribed copy of One Hundred Years of Solitude, presented to him by the author on a visit to Mexico. ‘I offer my thoughts to his family and friends, whom I hope take  solace in the fact that Gabo’s work will live on for generations to come,’ he said. Garcia Marquez was admitted to hospital in Mexico, where he has lived for the past three decades, on March 31 suffering from lung and urinary infections. He spent eight days there before returning home to his family, who said in a statement at the time that his health was ‘stable’ but ‘fragile’. The cause of his death, however, was not known last night. Fernanda Familiar, a spokesman for his family including his wife, Mercedes Barcha, said last night: ‘Gabriel Garcia Marquez has died. Mercedes and her sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo, have authorised me to give the information. Such deep sadness.’ Scroll down for video . Legendary: His flamboyant and melancholy fictional works - among them 'Chronicle of a Death Foretold,' `'Love in the Time of Cholera' and 'Autumn of the Patriarch' - outsold everything published in Spanish except the Bible (pictured in 2007) Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos also paid tribute to the author on Twitter, saying: ‘One Hundred Years of Solitude and  sadness for the death of the greatest Colombian of all time.’ Former US president Bill Clinton said: ‘From the time I read One Hundred Years of Solitude more than 40 years ago, I was always amazed by his unique gifts of imagination, clarity of thought, and emotional honesty... I was honoured to be his friend and to know his great heart and brilliant mind for more than 20 years.’ Booker Prize-winning author Ian McEwan said: ‘One would have to go back to Dickens to find a writer of the very highest literary quality who commanded such extraordinary persuasive powers over whole populations. 'It really is an extraordinary phenomenon, his literary career.’ Cristobal Pera, editorial director of Penguin Random House in Mexico, said: ‘He is like the Mandela of literature because of the impact that he has had on readers all over the world. 'His influence is universal, and that is a very rare thing.’ Garcia Marquez has made few public appearances in recent years, and in 2012 his younger brother revealed that the author was  suffering from dementia and had stopped writing. Jaime Garcia Marquez said: ‘He has problems with his memory. Sometimes I cry because I feel like I’m losing him.’ The epic 1967 novel One Hundred Years Of Solitude sold more than 50 million copies in more than 30 languages – outselling everything published in Spanish except for the Bible. The story deals with the fictional town of Macondo, whose residents become infected by insomnia that shrouds them in forgetfulness. Political: Despite being denied U.S. visas for years over his politics, he was courted by presidents and kings and counted Bill Clinton (pictured together in 2007) and Francois Mitterrand among his friends . Controversial: Marquez, pictured with Fidel Castro in 2000, turned down repeated calls for him to run for president of Colombia . High point: Garcia Marquez won the Nobel prize in 1982 (pictured) He described Latin America as a 'source of insatiable creativity, full of sorrow and beauty, of which this roving and nostalgic Colombian is but one cipher more, singled out by fortune . His final breath: The author spent his last days in this hospital . Impish: Garcia Marquez married Mercedes Barcha, a neighbor from childhood days, in 1985 and they are pictured in 2007 returning to his hometown of Aracataca for the first time in 25 years .","Gabriel Garcia Marquez has died on Thursday and the cause was not immediately known but his heath had been in failing in recent years .

"CSKA Moscow officials have accused Manchester airport immigration officials of deliberately refusing their star player Zoran Tosic the right to play in the Champions League match at the Etihad Stadium. Former Manchester United winger Tosic is not in the team to face City after allegedly arriving at the airport on Tuesday with the wrong visa. The Serb was allowed in the country but not allowed to play in or even attend the match. Now directors of the Russian club have claimed the decision was a deliberate act aimed at sabotaging CSKA’s plans for tonight’s game in Group E. CSKA Moscow's Zoran Tosic was told he couldn’t play against Manchester City because of a visa issue . According to sources in Russia, the former Manchester United player was only in possession of a ‘transit visa’ rather than the necessary work visa. As such he was allowed in to the country but told he could not play in the game or even travel to the stadium for the game. It is understood that Tosic is currently at the CSKA team hotel in Manchester City centre. CSKA, meanwhile, are considering an official complaint, feeling that their player has been deliberately targeted because of the threat he carries on the field. City need to win after taking only two points from their first three matches. Tosic (left) apparently only had a 'transit visa' and so was forced to stay at the team's hotel during the match . CSKA general director Roman Babayev said: ‘Initially there was a discrepancy and he was issued not a tourist visa, but a transit visa. ‘The English consulate advised that Serbs do not really need a tourist visa, they may arrive as transit passengers without a visa and it is issued on the spot. ‘Nevertheless, the transit visa was issued, so he had the right to stay in the UK for 48 hours, that is enough. ‘But the English border guards showed some over-adherence to the rules and found on the internet that he is a CSKA player, and felt that he had come to England to work. ‘They demanded a wok visa, which is impossible and unacceptable. ‘After a long time of wrangling, he was admitted to the country because they had no right not to (let him in), as he had a visa. Sergio Aguero gives Manchester City the lead during the two side's clash at the Khimki Arena in Moscow . ‘However, they seized his passport, which is also the first time in our experience that a passport of a citizen of another country has been confiscated. ‘The English migration service has received several requests from the Serbian consulate in England and the Russian embassy in England. ‘They considered the matter at length and in the end, not only did he not go to the match, he was even forbidden to be a spectator at the stadium and they demanded that he leave the territory of Manchester before the match. ‘Will we submit a protest? English people still can’t calm down, but, I think there is already no sense in it, because it already won’t affect the result, but it’s not very pleasant. ‘I am sure that this would not have happened in any other European country.’","CSKA Moscow and Manchester City face each other in Champions League .

"The step-grandchildren of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels share a fortune worth at least £3.8billion from their family's wartime industrial success, it has been revealed. Four sisters and the two children of a deceased sibling are worth around £760million each, according to an investigation by Bloomberg. The family's wealthy history can be traced to two men who owed their success to the rise of the Nazi party -  Joseph Goebbels and a businessman named Guenther Quandt. Joseph Goebbels with his wife Magda and their children, Helga, Hildegard, Helmut, Hedwig, Holdine and Heidrun, 1942. Harald Quandt, his step-son, is in uniform at the back of the photo . Both were married at different times to Magda Ritschel. Harald Quant - the only surviving son from Magda's first marriage - joined the German Luftwaffe during the Second World War and was being held as a prisoner by Allied forces in the Libya when he received a farewell letter from his mother and step-father Joseph Goebbels. The pair committed suicide alongside their six children on May 1, 1945 in Hitler's bunker. He and his half-brother Herbert inherited their father's empire which produced Mauser firearms and anti-aircraft missiles for the Third Reich's war machine. Joseph Goebbels was one of the most important and influential people in Nazi Germany. Hitler put him in charge of the party's propaganda machine in 1929 and he played a key role in implementing the dictator's agenda. His limp and sharp tongue earned him the nickname among some as the 'Poison Dwarf'. He organized attacks against Jews, banned them from the world of the arts and media, censored the news and supported Nazi propaganda films. As the Second World War turned in favour of the Allies, he increased his propaganda in order to convince the German people of the idea of 'total war' and mobilization.

Billionaires: Herbert Quandt's widow Johanna pictured with her son Stefan, left, and her daughter Susanne Klatten, right,  have remained in the public eye as BMW shareholders . The four sisters inherited about 1.5 billion deutsche marks (£483 million) after the death of their mother, Inge, in 1978, according to the family’s official biography, 'Die Quandts'. They manage their wealth through the Harald Quandt Holding GmbH, a family investment company and trust named after their father. Fritz Becker, the chief executive officer of the family entities, told Bloomberg: 'The family wants to stay private and that is an acceptable situation for me. 'We invest our money globally and if it’s $1 billion, $500 million or $3 billion, who cares?' The Quandt family fortune can be traced to Germany's involvement in both world wars.

'There . was constant rivalry,' said Bonn-based history professor Joachim . Scholtyseck, author of a family-commissioned study about their . involvement with the Third Reich, in a telephone interview with Bloomberg. 'It didn’t matter that Goebbels didn’t like him. It didn’t have any influence on Quandt’s ability to make money.' From . 1940 to 1945, the Quandt family factories were staffed with more than . 50,000 forced civilian laborers, prisoners of war and concentration camp . workers, according to Scholtyseck’s 1,183-page study.

According to 'Die Quandts' the siblings try to get together a few times a year to discuss their investments. After Scholtyseck’s study was published in 2011, cousins Gabriele and Stefan Quandt acknowledged their family’s ties and involvement with the Third Reich in an interview with Germany’s Die Zeit newspaper. 'Magda killed her six children in the Fuehrerbunker. Our father loved his half-siblings very much. And when, like me, you have something like this in your family history, you think: It can’t be any worse,' Gabriele Quandt said in the interview. 'It’s a sad truth that forced laborers died in Quandt companies,' said Stefan. 'They have to live with the name. It’s part of the history,' said Scholtyseck.

There was no such luck for West Brom manager Irvine, though; his own supporters turned against him as they suffered a fourth defeat in five games. Wenger, however, still isn't out of the woods. Certainly not with a section of the club's support. Even as they celebrated victory, supporters made their feeling towards Wenger crystal clear. One banner had: 'Arsene thanks for the memories but it's time to say goodbye', emblazoned across it, another read: 'Enough is enough, Wenger out.' ‘I don’t want to comment on that,’ said the Arsenal manager. ‘I try to do my best for the club that I love. We are very united with the players and staff around the team, that’s all you can do.’ Nevertheless, the Frenchman will return to London with renewed optimism as his side recorded their first league win since November 1 and are finally seeing key players return to fitness. He was able to revert back to his preferred central defensive partnership of Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny, the France international fully-recovered from an Achilles problem to make his first appearance in two months. Likewise, Olivier Giroud made his first start since the end of August following a broken ankle at the Hawthorns, though keeper Wojciech Szczesny again missed out with a hip injury as third choice Damien Martinez made his second consecutive start. For West Brom, all eyes and hopes were pinned on Saido Berahino, who was making his first appearance since details of his drink-driving offence emerged earlier this week. Interestingly, Danny Welbeck started the clash out on the left with the fit again Giroud preferred as the lone striker. Following their morale-boosting win over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night, Arsenal started brightly - Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sanchez testing Ben Foster with efforts from the edge of the box inside the opening 10 minutes. After a run of one win in seven, Irvine's side were understandably tentative in the opening exchanges.

Santi Cazorla                90          11.6      7.2 . West Brom's hearts were in their mouths two minutes later when Giroud dispossessed Foster, who had gone walkabout near the left hand touchline, but the Frenchman failed to direct the ball into an empty net from a tight angle. Foster was smiling, his manager wasn't as amused, though, as Arsenal asserted their authority. Giroud and Welbeck combined to set up up Cazorla on the edge of the area, but, with time to steady himself, the Spaniard sent another shot straight at Foster. Arsenal were well on top at this point. But Wenger and the visiting support had seen this all before. Not turning domination in goals is becoming somewhat of an unwanted Arsenal trait of late. Wenger knew it, too, pacing anxiously along his technical area despite the fact his side were fully in charge. The chances kept coming - and being wasted; Ramsey this time firing wide from 16 yards after Mulumbu foolishly dallied on the ball on the edge of his own area. Had Stephane Sessegnon produced a better pass after easily beating Calum Chambers down the left on the stroke of half-time then Wenger would have had much more to think about at half-time. The second half started in similar fashion to the first, Welbeck showing indecisiveness in front of goal, choosing to pass to Ramsey when shooting would have been a much better option in the 51st minute. Mertesacker then fired wide from the edge of a crowded penalty area after Foster fumbled under pressure from Giroud. Then, in the 54th minute, came West Brom's best opening off the game, Berahino springing Arsenal's offside trap only to shoot into the side-netting with Martinez to beat.

It wasn't the finish the striker was looking for in front of England manager Roy Hodgson, who was at the Hawthorns yesterday. Nor was it the finish Irvine wanted, who knew full well a chance like that may not arrive again in the 35 minutes remaining. And just five minutes later, West Brom paid the ultimate price as Cazorla sped past Andre Wisdom down Arsenal's left before standing up an inch perfect cross for Welbeck to head past Foster. It was no more than Arsenal deserved, not that would have been any comfort to Irvine who would of had Berahino's miss still in the forefront of his thoughts.

West Brom supporters were just as frustrated, directing their anger at Irvine in the 76th minute, showing their displeasure at his decision to replace Sessegnon with Georgious Samaras crystal clear with cries of 'You don't know what you're doing.' But 10 minutes from the end their jeers nearly turned to cheers after Berahino hit the crossbar with a towering header from substitute Cristian Gamboa's cross. Craig Gardner then smashed a 20 yard effort narrowly wide of Martinez's left hand post as the Baggies pressed for an unlikely leveller. But Arsenal held on to secure a vital victory.

"Noel Hunt grabbed a debut goal in stoppage time as Ipswich snatched a dramatic 1-0 Sky Bet Championship win at Charlton. The striker, who only joined Town on loan from Leeds 48 hours earlier, came on as an 83rd-minute substitute and struck the winner with the last kick of the match. The goal condemned Charlton to a first home defeat of the season as Ipswich briefly climbed to second in the table.

Town threatened first in a lively start to the lunchtime encounter when Luke Chambers headed Stephen Hunt's corner narrowly wide, and from Charlton goalkeeper Nick Pope's clearance, Callum Harriott teed up Johann Gudmundsson - whose shot was well saved by Bartosz Bialkowski. Harriott's attempted curler was also kept out by Bialkowski, while the lively winger then superbly turned inside Tyrone Mings only to pull his shot wide from 15 yards. Pope, who comes from a family of Ipswich fans and was released by the club as a youngster, did well to keep out a fierce drive from Paul Anderson, made a bit of a meal of keeping out Daryl Murphy's effort but then got down smartly to divert David McGoldrick's header wide.

At the other end Bialkowski was also kept on his toes and made a fine diving stop to deny the overlapping Charlton right-back Chris Solly before half-time. With both sets of strikers misfiring, Ipswich left-back Mings also tried to take matters into his own hands just after the interval, striding forward and skipping past two tackles on the edge of the area before taking aim and firing inches wide. A curler from Murphy failed to trouble Bialkowski as it flew the wrong side of the post, and substitute Connor Sammon was denied by a superb last-ditch challenge from Andre Bikey. Things might have been different had Charlton's best chance of the match fallen to their top scorer, Igor Vetokele. Instead the Angolan striker created it, cutting the ball back from the byline to Harriott 10 yards out, only to see his team-mate take a swing and a miss in front of goal. And the hosts were made to pay at the end when McGoldrick's half-cleared cross fell to Hunt, who lashed it through a crowd of players and into the net.","Ipswich beat Charlton in the closing seconds at The Valley on Saturday .

"More than half of black Americans think Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson should be convicted of murdering Michael Brown - compared to just 17 per cent of white Americans. The results from a survey carried out by Rasmussen reveal a stark difference in attitudes towards the death of the black teenager, which has sparked riots in the Missouri city and across the U.S. Nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of the 1,000 American adults surveyed believe Wilson should be found guilty of murder, while another quarter (26 per cent) thought he was acting in self defense when he gunned down the unarmed teenager in broad daylight on August 9. But 57 per cent of black . adults think he should be convicted compared to only 17 per cent of white Americans and 24 per cent of other minority Americans. Scroll down for video . Divided: The results of a survey have shown that black and white Americans have different attitudes towards the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown, left, at the hands of Missouri cop, Dareen Wilson, right . Of those who are undecided about what should happened to Wilson, most - 56 per cent - are white. The survey results also show that black Americans are more convinced that the violent riots since the . killing are legitimate outrage rather than criminal . activity. Police have said they fired tear gas and rubber bullets in response to gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails over the weekend. Exactly a quarter of all those surveyed said they believed the protests have mostly been legitimate outrage, whereas 52 per cent think the riots have been carried out by criminals taking advantage of the situation. Protest: Residents of Ferguson show protest the killing on Sunday. A quarter of Americans believe the riots have been based on legitimate anger, but more believe criminals have been taking advantage of the situation . Among these, 54 per cent of white Americans and 53 per cent of other minorities think the violence is mostly down to criminals, compared to 35 per cent of black people surveyed. In addition, black Americans are more likely to think the protests are legitimate anger. As tension grows in Ferguson, the Missouri State Police and the state . National Guard have been called in to help deal with the violence. Of those who took part in the survey, 27 per cent believe the police have responded well, while a similar percentage - 28 - call their response 'poor'. The results also showed that black Americans were more than twice as likely as whites and other minority adults to rate the police response as poor. Gunned down: On Monday, one of the Brown family's attorneys indicates the location of the 'kill shot' And while 68 per cent of Americans say . they have been following the new reports very closely, black Americans . are far more likely to be following it, the survey revealed. The racial divide apparent in the survey results is reminiscent of the . trial of George Zimmerman, who shot dead an unarmed . African-American teenager in Florida in 2012. Zimmerman was found not guilty at . a trial last year. This latest survey shows that eight out of ten black voters believe the system is unfair to minorities. Brown, 18, was shot dead on August 9 and sustained six bullet wounds, including the fatal shot to the top of his head. His killer was identified as Darren Wilson, who has since been placed on paid administrative leave. The survey by Rasmussen Reports was carried out on August 15 and 16 and involved 1,000 people.","There is a stark difference in attitudes of white and black Americans towards the Michael Brown case, a survey has shown .
Black Americans are more likely to think cop Darren Wilson should be found guilty of shooting dead the unarmed teenager .
White Americans are more likely to think the subsequent riots have been carried out by opportunists rather than because of anger .
Black Americans have also been following the case more closely than white Americans, according to the results from Rasmussen ."
