"Colin Montgomerie is tipping bookies’ favourite Rory McIlroy to take advantage of Tiger Woods’ absence and win the US Open. The world No 6 celebrated his first-ever major triumph back in 2011 when he won the US Open at Congressional and his form of late, despite his high-profile break-up with tennis ace Caroline Wozniacki, has improved considerably. The 25-year-old showed his strength and class to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth last month and he shot six-under par to finish tied-15th at the recent Memorial Championship.VIDEO Scroll down for Rory McIlroy practising his swing ahead of the US Open . Prepared: Rory McIlroy talks with his dad Gerry at Pinehurst as he builds up to the US Open starting on Thursday . Chillaxed: Colin Montgomerie believes that McIlroy can storm the US open in the absence of Tiger Woods . McIlroy will begin his quest for glory on Thursday and Friday alongside two fellow former US Open champions in Webb Simpson and good friend Graeme McDowell, completing a field buoyed by the absence of former world No 1 Woods who remains sidelined with a back problem. And Montgomerie believes the Northern Ireland native will be in contention for a third major success come Sunday’s final round. ‘Pinehurst is a ball strikers course and he [McIlroy] being the best ball striker in the world has to start as favourite. ‘Without Tiger [Woods] there, Rory McIlory is the favourite and you’d expect him to be right there. 'Who can say he’s going to win because golf is one of these things. But Rory will be in contention. Definitely.’ McIlory has admitted he will be making some equipment changes to his bag this week, opting to put a three-iron in and go with a three-wedge system comprising of a pitch wedge, 54 and 59 degree clubs. And Montgomerie, who was McIlroy’s Ryder Cup-winning captain at Celtic Manor four years ago, has warned Pinehurst will be a difficult beast to tame. Absent: Tiger Woods will miss the even with a back injury . Victors: Montgomerie, McIlroy and their Europe team-mates celebrating their Ryder Cup win in 2010 . ‘The US Open is seen as the toughest to win.’ he said, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail at Gleneagles, venue for this year’s Ryder Cup extravaganza, where he launched the Johnnie Walker Blue Label limited edition whiskey on Monday. ‘Pinehurst is very different this year. They’ve cut back all of the rough - in fact, there’s no rough at all really. ‘Ben Crenshaw and his team have been asked by the USGA to put Pinehurst back to its original state. ‘So, on all of the greens, you may run off and there’s no rough to stop it. Instead of stopping short in the rough to give you a flop shot, the ball will now run 30 yards extra down a slope. ‘What is means is, you’ve got all sorts of options. Do you chip it? Do you putt it? It’s very difficult. If it’s at all breezy it could be near impossible. ‘This is a real, real challenge and the greens are firm too. A true test.’ Swinger: McIlroy hits his tee shot on the seventh hole during a practice round at Pinehurst on Tuesday . Balls: The Northern Irishman smiles on the practice range as he gears up for his tilt at the trophy . Justin Rose ended the 43-year hoodoo of an English champion when he became the first since Tony Jacklin in 1970 to win the US Open at Merion last year. Montgomerie, 50, reckons Rose has every chance of defending his title in North Carolina and claims it’s all thanks to the benchmark set by Padraig Harrington. Harrington won back-to-back Open championships in 2007 and 2008 before landing the PGA Championship in the same calendar year. And Montgomerie said: ‘Justin’s chances of retaining are very high. ‘I think that Padraig Harrington gave those types of players belief that, “Look, I can do this lads, I’ve won three out of four majors... and so can you”. ‘I think it’s helped Rory, it helped Graeme McDowell and helped Justin Rose in winning these major championships since. They all have a great opportunity again. 'Rory, I think, is one of the favourites. But Justin Rose is returning to form following his shoulder injury. ‘Going back to a championship that you’ve won, albeit at a different venue, as a defending champion you feel you’ve got a chance to do it again. And, obviously, Justin is up there with the favourites to win.’ Pointer: Rose points to the sky after his final putt of his US Ope triumph last year . Throwback: He was the first Englishman to do so since Tony Jacklin in 1970 . Montgomerie, who will be summarising the play for Sky Sports in North Carolina this week, is refusing to rule out the heavyweight American stars though. ‘Who could discount Bubba Watson?’ he added. ‘You never know what’s going to happen. He could just blast it round there and get away with it. ‘And then there’s Phil Mickelson. We’d all love for him to finally win the US Open. Six times runner-up in the one event he’s not won. ‘This time he’s playing a course that could suit him, especially with the short game wizardry that he has. ‘There’s a number of guys potentially who could win it really.’ So, what about the chances of a Scottish success in the States on Sunday? ‘Well, I like the look of Stephen Gallacher right now,’ he said. ‘It would be great if he gets in the Ryder Cup team at Glenagles for Scotland’s sake. He’s hitting the ball extremely well.’ Diamond in the rough: Two-times Masters champion Bubba Watson is a contender for his first US Open . Haunted: As is Phil Mickelson, who has come second six times in the event without ever winning it . Perhaps Gallacher will take inspiration from Montgomerie in his pursuit of a first ever major. Montgomerie, after all, was the last Scot to return home victorious from across the Atlantic after his stunning Senior PGA Championship victory at Harbor Shores last month. ‘It was wonderful,’ said Montgomerie. If you lead going into the last round and shoot a 65 you’d be unlucky not to lose really. ‘But at the same time, it was great to win in America. It has been a long time coming and I’m thrilled. ‘I guess it was a relief more than anything. 22 years I’ve been playing in America, playing in a 130-odd tournaments, so it was nice to finally win a stroke play event!’ Plug: Montgomerie poses at Gleneagles at a Johnnie Walker publicity event .","Colin Montgomerie backs Rory McIlory to win US Open at Pinehurst .

"The man charged with funding terrorism after Tuesday's early morning raids had been under surveillance for more than eight months. Hassan El Sabsabi was arrested at his home in Seabrook, Melbourne after AFP officers were tipped off by their FBI counterparts that he was allegedly sending money to an American fighter in Syria. The 23 year old appeared in Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday afternoon charged with six counts of intentionally making funds available to a terrorist organisation. Around 25,000 pages from social media accounts and 500 telephone calls and messages will have to be analysed as part of the case against the accused, the court heard. Scroll down for video . A 23-year-old Seabrook man has been charged with making funds available to a terrorist organisation . The man was arrested in Seabrook on Tuesday morning following terror raids across five suburbs in Melbourne - Seabrook, Meadow Heights, Flemington, Kealba and Broadmeadows . The 23-year-old Seabrook man appeared at the the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday afternoon . Police said earlier that about $12,000 had allegedly been provided to a man in the United States, allowing him to join terrorist militants in Syria some months ago, where he continues to fight there. Prosecutor Andrew Doyle was granted more time to prepare his brief of evidence against El Sabsabi because of the volume of material, a lot of which needs to be transcribed and in some cases translated. 'A substantial amount of material will be sourced from overseas,' Mr Doyle told the court. El Sabsabi's lawyer Trieu Huynh asked for his client to be transferred from the Melbourne Custody Centre to the Melbourne Assessment Prison as soon as possible. He is due to reappear on February 3. 'Given the nature of the charges (and) it's his first time in custody, it's extremely onerous on him,' he said. He also asked for a doctor to examine his client as soon as possible for his medical conditions, which Mr Huynh said he would not outline in open court. Police said the joint Australian Federal Police and Victoria Police counter terrorism raids in Seabrook, Meadow Heights, Flemington, Kealba and Broadmeadows on Tuesday were not related to last week's incident in Endeavour Hills in which an alleged terrorist was shot dead. Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said police took action because they believed more money was about to be sent to the US citizen, who has been fighting in Syria for several months. Federal police officers question members of the public outside a house as part of  raids in Seabrook . Federal police officers investigate a Seabrook home as members of the public look on . 'We are of the view that further funds were about to be transferred to this person in Syria, so today was about an overt action to resolve this matter,' he said. The 23-year-old man will appear before Melbourne Magistrates Court this afternoon. In parliament Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australians who fund terrorists are complicit in their 'dreadful deeds'. Mr Abbott said the anti-money laundering agency Austrac had been given an extra $20 million to help track down terrorist funding. Federal cabinet has yet to give final approval for a combat mission in Iraq to fight Islamic State. But Mr Abbott said that subject to cabinet consideration 'our objective is to support governments that don't commit genocide against their own people, nor allow their territory to support terrorism against our people'. ASIO will brief state and territory attorneys-general and police ministers at a meeting in Geelong on Friday on the national security threat. Australian Federal Police officers will also brief the meeting on recent raids. On Tuesday, more than 100 police officers executed seven search warrants simultaneously across Melbourne at 6.45am. It will be alleged the 23-year-old man paid $12,000 to support a US citizen who is currently fighting in Syria Pictured is  a member of the public and a police officer . A neighbour said the arrested man moved into the Seabrook residence with his wife in December . There is no intelligence to indicate the 23-year-old arrested man was planning a terrorist attack and police believe he was acting alone, Assistant Commissioner Gaughan said. Assistant Commissioner Gaughan said  police executed  six more search warrants at residences outside Seabrook to gain evidence in relation to the charges against the man. 'There is no suggestion at this stage that those people were involved in any criminality,' he said. A large amount of electronic evidence was seized, which will be analysed by investigators over the next few months. The searches that were conducted were done 'in a far more low-key manner' than other recent terror raids in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Graham Ashton said. 'This is a terrorism financing case, we didn't assess there being a significant community safety risk or a significant risk to our officers,' he said. The 23-year-old man was arrested on Point Cook Road opposite Seabrook Primary School. More than 100 police officers executed seven search warrants across Melbourne at 6.45am on Tuesday . There is no intelligence to indicate the man was planning a terrorist attack and police believe he acted alone . He is believed to be a pizza shop worker in his 20s, 3AW reported. Neighbour Sandeep Singh, 32, saw the man arrested and taken away in a car. 'I've seen him but never spoken to him,' Mr Singh told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was alright, says hello and that's it.' Mr Singh said it was 'a bit scary' to see counter terrorism activity on his street. Another neighbour Here Du Buisson Perrine, 71, said the arrested man moved into the home with his wife in December. 'He has an Aussie accent. I would think he was born in Australia,' Mr Du Buisson Perrine told The Australian. Mr Du Buisson Perrine added that the man was Muslim, and that the pair spoke almost every day. 'I've heard him praying once or twice, but only very quietly,' he said. 'He likes gardening. I've given him advice about his lemon trees. He's a very friendly, very nice guy.' Victorian Premier Denis Napthine said he was briefed by police as Tuesday's raids started and was told they were part of a long-running and ongoing counter-terrorism operation. 'They are not about a specific threat or there is certainly no immediate concern for public safety,' Dr Napthine told 3AW. The premier also urged the community to be tolerant and come together at this time, and said law enforcement was 'ahead of the game' in combating the risk of terrorism. 'It's a sad situation that we now face, but we can have confidence in the work of ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and the VicPol. They do a terrific job,' Dr Napthine said. This comes after the two police officers stabbed last week before the fatal shooting of an alleged terrorist at Endeavour Hills  released a statement. 'We would like to thank our family, friends, colleagues and everyone who has helped and supported us through this difficult time,' they said. 'We are both holding up well and appreciate everyone's kind thoughts and well wishes. We ask that our privacy is respected while we continue to recover.' Police fatally shot Numan Haider outside the Endeavour Hills police station where it was arranged they would meet the 18-year-old after conducting raids on his home Tuesday morning. It was agreed that Haider would greet a Victoria Police senior constable and a 43-year-old AFP officer cordially on Tuesday night. Seconds after meeting the 18-year-old he took out a weapon and repeatedly stabbed both officers. He was then killed by a single shot. On Tuesday, Deputy Commissioner Ashton said Haider's family received death threats in the days after his death, which was concerning. He stressed Haider's family had nothing to do with the incident involving the 18-year-old. 'Family, particularly the parents of the young man, received death threats over the weekend,' he told reporters. 'This is an innocent family. 'I think the fact they received those deaths threats last week is very disappointing.'

"The charity stunt has lured athletes, celebrities, politicians and rock stars and gone viral on the Internet, but don't look for U.S. diplomats to get in on the fun. Lawyers at the State Department have banned American ambassadors and other high-profile foreign service officers from participating in the ice-bucket challenge to raise money and awareness for Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. In a cable sent this week to all U.S. diplomatic missions, the lawyers say it runs afoul of federal ethics rules barring officials from using public office for private gain 'no matter how worthy the cause.' Former President George W. Bush took part in the ice bucket challenge this week (pictured) The unclassified cable, sent on Tuesday, was obtained by The Associated Press Thursday. The cable said public health and disease prevention are some of the State Department's highest priorities, noting U.S. funding for global programs to fight HIV and AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, smallpox and polio and recent efforts to combat the Ebola virus. And, it complimented the ALS Association on the success of its ice bucket challenge, which has raised more than $40 million and attracted a plethora of notable participants, including former President George W. Bush,  television hosts Martha Stewart and Matt Lauer and pro golfer Greg Norman. But it also pointed out that choosing among worthy charities can be a difficult personal decision that is made 'even more difficult when high-ranking State Department personnel with high-profile positions are asked to participate in charitable fund-raising, and concerns about preference and favoritism always arise.' 'There are firmly established rules preventing the use of public office, such as our ambassadors, for private gain, no matter how worthy a cause,' the cable said. 'Thus, high-ranking State Department officials are unfortunately unable to participate in the ice bucket challenge. 'We since wish the ALS Association continued success in its ice bucket campaign, and in its fight against Lou Gehrig's disease.' By the time the cable was sent at least one high-ranking diplomat, Ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro, had already participated and had challenged U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power to douse herself with ice water for the cause. But by then, Power and the other ambassadors got the memo.","Ice bucket challenge would go against ethical rules banning officials from using public office for private gain 'no matter how worthy the cause'

"Fake: Sneha Mashru, pictured right, best friend of Anni Dewani, left, told the court the Dewanis were pretending to be in love . Shrien and Anni Dewani pretended to be in love at their lavish Indian wedding, Anni's best friend and cousin this morning told Dewani's murder trial. 'Anni told me that Shrien and her had decided to act for the wedding', Sneha Mashru told Shrien Dewani's South African murder trial. 'She said ""Sneha, do we look happy together?"" because me and Shrien - we are acting'. The revelation came as Sneha Mashru - Anni's best friend - was asked about the previous day's witness testimony in which she laid out her suspicions Anni's husband. Sneha disputed the defence's suggestion that she may not have known everything about her best friend's life - and rejected as misleading a doctor's medical record which shows how Anni and Shrien had been trying for a baby. 'If Anni was trying to fall pregnant then she would have told me', Sneha - who is Anni's paternal cousin - told Shrien Dewani's murder trial . 'Also I know for a fact that Shrien and Anni's sex life was not good because Shrien was having problems getting an erection.' Anni Dewani was shot dead on her honeymoon on the evening of 13th November, 2010 when the taxi she and her husband Shrien were travelling in was hijacked as it passed through the dangerous Cape Town township of Gugulethu. While four South Africans - including the taxi's driver - have so far been convicted of carrying out the hijack, the country's police force has accused Shrien Dewani, a businessman from Bristol, of arranging and paying for his wife's murder. Dewani denies the allegation. Giving witness evidence for a second day, Sneha Mashru was challenged on her claims that Dewani had acted 'strangely' on his return from South Africa. 'I expected him to behave more grieving', Sneha told the court. 'I wanted to see the sadness in him. I couldn't see the love.' Dewani's lawyer, Francois van Zyl, countered that Shrien Dewani will not deny that he is a 'perfectionist, calculating, controlling' person. Not so happy: Mrs Mashru claims that Anni Dewani told her the she and Shrien had decided to 'act in love for the wedding' in 2010 (pictured) Killing: Anni Dewani, nee Hindocha, was shot dead on her honeymoon on the evening of 13th November, 2010 . Testimony: Swedish Mrs Mashru told Cape Town's high court that she knew the Dewanis' sex life was not good because Shrien was having problems getting an erection . Dewanis' actions, his lawyer said, ""are in keeping with his perfectionist traits"". Sneha Mashru did not demure. Cape Town's High Court also heard this morning from Sgt Cornelius Mellet, one of the first police officers to talk to Mr Dewani after the hijack. Sgt. Mellet said he had been surprised to notice that Shrien Dewani's 'appearance was clean' after the November 2010 incident. 'In my experience [...] this person was someone who was in a robbery, but without a struggle taking place', Sgt. Mellet told the court. Accused: Shrien Dewani arrives at the Western Cape High Court ahead of the trial on Monday . Cold: Anni's best friend, Mrs Mashru told the court yesterday that she did not feel Dewani grieved . Asked to elaborate, the policeman said: 'I am a married man who has been married for many years and I would have been very worried if my wife has disappeared. 'It was strange for me that Mr Dewani did not enquire what the police were doing within their powers to get hold his wife.' Under cross examination, however, Sgt. Mellet confirmed that he did not provide the detectives investigating Anni's murder with this information until almost a year after Anni's murder. Mellet's first official statement on his interaction with Mr Dewani, it was revealed today, was taken on the 12 October 2012 - just under eleven months after Anni's death, . Furthermore, Sgt. Mellet conceded that he had no written notes of Dewani's allegedly suspicious words or actions - and that the only notes he does have contain no reference to Dewani having acted strangely at all. The case continues.","Sneha Mashru gave evidence at Cape Town court for the second day .

"A woman has spoken of the moment she fulfilled her mother’s dying wish – by having breast implants. Carol Stapleton, 55, from Deal, Kent had dreamt of having breast surgery for more than 40 years. But her wish only came true after her terminally ill mother told her she must have the operation when she died and pledged to leave her enough cash to cover the £4,000 operation in her will. Carol Stapleton dreamt of having breast surgery for more than 40 years, the 55-year-old from Deal, Kent was left the money for an operation after her mother passed. She went from a B cup (left) to an E cup (right) True to her word, when brush maker Joan died aged 82, she left Carol more than enough to cover surgery to boost her from a B cup to an E cup. So in August last year - 17 months after her mother’s death, Carol went under the knife. Carol is convinced her mother has since visited her in spirit to give her new bust her seal of approval. She believes her new chest is a wonderful way to remember her mother and that the parting gift didn’t just buy her new breasts, but happiness and confidence too. Carol said: ‘Mum knew how much I wanted surgery but there was always something more important to spend the money on. ‘One day I was moaning about it as usual when she sat me down and told me when she was gone there would be enough money for me to get them done and that she wanted me to have the surgery.' Joan pictured with Carol's son-  Carol and her mother were extremely close until Joan's death in August 2013 . Carol continued: 'Mum's words to me were: ""You’ll not have to worry about no bust when me and your dad pop our clogs."" 'It was her way of telling that was how she wanted me to spend my inheritance. ‘Mum was always a very forceful person who liked to be listened to.' Carol recalls feeling self conscious about her bust from a young age. She says: ‘From the age of 15 I wished for bigger boobs, I didn’t feel very feminine and was envious of women with bigger chests. 'I kept hoping they would grow but they never did.‘ . 'Mum knew how I felt. In fact, I suspect she probably felt the same but in those days you just got on with it.’ Joan (left) told her daughter Carol (right) about her wish for £4,000 of her inheritance to be spent on a breast augmentation after she was diagnosed with life-limiting emphysema . As she grew older Carol always hoped to be able to one day afford surgery but divorced with a young son, she was diagnosed with MS and unable to work. So instead, she resorted to stuffing her bras and buying padded underwear, but always vowing to one day fund a way to have surgery. She was turned down for surgery on the NHS despite suffering depression triggered by her body insecurities. She says: ‘ I felt like a fraud. I looked OK in clothes but under the padding I felt there was nothing, it affected my self esteem terribly.’ Carol’s yearning for implants was no secret to second husband Dennis who she married seven years ago or her son, now aged 25. Carol said: ‘My whole family knew how much I wanted surgery - I’d been talking about it for years.’ Joan pictured with her grandson . But it was after lifelong smoker Joan was diagnosed with life-limiting emphysema that she sat Carol down and firmly told her what she wanted her to do when she died. Carol said: ‘Mum was far too practical to offer to pay for it while she was still alive. But she didn’t mince her words when she told me I must go ahead when she and dad died. ‘It meant the world to me that not only was she giving me her blessing, but she was actually making it possible. ‘Of course I hoped that wouldn’t be for a long time because I hated the thought of losing my mother, we were very close. 'But Mum was in poor health, relying on oxygen to get through the day and nobody knew how long she had left, so she wanted me to know her wishes. About that she was clear.’ So with her mother’s blessing, Carol began researching clinics offering breast augmentations and found the Transform cosmetic sugery group. She said: 'It felt odd researching the operation knowing I wouldn’t be going ahead until Mum and dad both died but Mum had told me what she wanted me to do and I couldn’t deny the inevitable.’ Since going from a B cup to an E cup, Carol is more relaxed about her appearance and feels clothes fit her better . It was another two years before Joan succumbed to the disease in March 2012, passing away from a chest infection just 24 hours after her former miner husband Sydney died of pneumonia. Carol said: ‘Mum had fought her condition for so long that I know she died of a broken heart. 'I was devastated to lose them both and the only comfort I had was that they were together.’ She says she took solace in being able to execute and later carry out her mother’s wishes by forging ahead with plans for surgery. She said: ‘I did a lot for mum and I missed her terribly. It was a small comfort to know I was doing something she wanted me to do. ‘I imagined her looking down on me and smiling because she had made it possible.’ Carol even claims that when she was taken into theatre at the Transform Hospital in Brentwood, Essex, she felt her mother’s presence. Carol believes her mother Joan (pictured) would approve of the way her confidence has grown since the operation . She said: ‘I hadn’t experienced anything like it before. ‘I felt a warmth and a comfort despite the fact I was going for surgery - I knew it was Mum looking after me. 'The sensation was in my throat, I had never experienced anything like it before, I felt she had come back to watch over me as I fulfilled her wish. 'Knowing what she was like I should think she also wanted to have a good look too.’ She recovered well from the surgery and was delighted with her new bust. Carol says she knows her mother would approve of the way her confidence has grown since the operation. She explains: ‘I’m more relaxed about my appearance, clothes fit me better and I feel much happier about myself - what mother wouldn’t want that for her daughter? ‘Now every time I look in the mirror I think about mum, what a great way to remember her by.’","Carol Stapleton dreamt of having breast surgery for more than 40 years .

"Found: Caleb Jacoby, the 16-year-old son of a Boston Globe columnist, has been found in New York's Times Square . The missing son of a newspaper columnist has been found after a multi-state search. Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby's 16-year-old son Caleb went missing from Brookline, Massachusetts on Monday afternoon. The teenager was found in New York City's Times Square Thursday afternoon but no further details about how he traveled there were released. On Thursday evening, Mr Jacoby announced the good news via Twitter to his more than 10,000 followers. 'Our prayers have been answered. We are thrilled to hear from the Brookline Police that our beloved son Caleb has been found and is safe,' he wrote. 'Words can’t express our gratitude for the extraordinary outpouring of kindness and support that we have received from so many people. 'All we can think of at this moment is how wonderful it will be to see Caleb again and shower him with love.' Mr Jacoby has been a conservative columnist for the Boston Globe since 1994 and is a member of the modern Orthodox synagogue Young Israel of Brookline. Caleb is still in the custody of the New York City police and travel arrangements are being made for him to be returned to his family in Massachusetts.

"Oscar Pistorius is 'coping' with his new life behind bars and managed to get some sleep during his first night in his solitary cell, according to a prison official who visited him today. The 27-year-old convicted killer was dressed in an orange prison-issue jumpsuit and seemed to be coping 'so far so good' when he was seen by Ofentse Morwane from the correctional services department. The Paralympic gold medallist  is undergoing a 36-hour 'comprehensive needs assessment' and orientation programme to inform him of the strict rules and regulations as a 'B' group inmate at the Kgosi Mampuru prison. Scroll down for video . Oscar Pistorius is seen in the back of an armoured police vehicle as he is transported away from the High Court. He is 'coping' with his new life behind bars and managed to get some sleep, says a prison official . He is starting a five-year sentence for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp – but could be out just ten months. His first night behind bars came as the model's parents told how they do 'not feel that justice has been done' but insisted they 'have to accept' the sentence imposed by the judge. Mr Morwane said: 'Once we have processed the inmate properly, we can draw up a ""sentence plan"" for him and make him aware of what programmes are available to him. 'I think he did get some rest over night and he looked to me like he was coping with his new situation. 'He has everything he needs. 'Upon arrival yesterday, all of his belongings were taken from him for safe-keeping until his release and he was allocated a cell, sheets, blanket, pillow, toothpaste and toilet paper.' Stark conditions: Prisoners are lined up inside the Kgosi Mumpuru 11 Management Centre during a surprise raid by prison officials checking for drugs and other contraband. The jail is the most likely one that Oscar Pistorius will be sent to if he is given a prison term for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . Grim: The athlete's lawyer has argued that there will be a risk from prison gangs if he is sent to jail . The hospital wing at the Kgosi Mampuru facility is heavily guarded round the clock and staffed by two trained nurses. The double-amputee's 'B' group classification entitles him to keep a small number of personal photographs in his cell, have two 'no-contact' visits at weekends and on public holidays – with a maximum of 45 visits per year. Once he has served six months of his sentence and proved himself to be a co-operative prisoner, Pistorius could be elevated to group 'A' - which would entitle him to more visits and and enjoy special privileges such as chocolate and Coca-Cola. The disgraced sprinter is one of nine disabled offenders, out of a total number of 7217, being held in the prison, which was formerly known as Pretoria Central and was notorious under apartheid rule for its brutal treatment of political prisoners. Stark: Prison officials in a guard hut along the perimeter fence of Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Facility, where Oscar Pistorius has spent his first night of a five-year jail sentence . The kingpin of one of its notorious 'numbers gangs' has already threatened to order 'a hit' on Pistorius if he is shown preferential treatment. Khalil Subjee, who is known as The General, leads the feared 26s gang which rewards acts of violence with promotion within the gang hierarchy. Mr Morwane insisted the prison's most famous inmate would 'certainly not' enjoy any special treatment during his incarceration. 'Every prisoner receives the same treatment here, Mr Pistorius will be no different.' Nevertheless, the South African runner was taken unshackled and alone from Pretoria's high court to the jail in an armoured police vehicle, with armed outriders. Remand and newly-sentenced inmates appearing at the court are usually transported together in the back of a large prison van. The athlete's legal team had argued that prison posed 'a danger' to him because of his disability and fragile mental state. But Judge Thokozile Masipa said she believed Pistorius's disability had been 'over-emphasised' and his 'excellent coping skills' would equip him to adapt to life behind bars. 'Justice has NOT been done - only Oscar knows the truth': Reeva Steenkamp's parents hit out as athlete faces just 10 months in jail for killing their daughter . The parents of the model shot dead by Oscar Pistorius say they do 'not feel that justice has been done' but insisted they 'have to accept' the sentence imposed by the judge. Pistorius, 27, known as the Blade Runner, was yesterday jailed for five years for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, 29, but could be out of prison in just 10 months. The sentence has been criticised by some as too lenient and sparked calls for it to be increased. Scroll down for video . 'Disappointed': Reeva Steenkamp's parents, June and Barry, do not believe justice has been served after Oscar Pistorius was handed a five-year jail term for killing their daughter - meaning he could be out in just 10 months . Miss Steenkamp's parents told ITV's Good Morning Britain they accepted the sentence and 'don't want revenge' or for the double-amputee to 'suffer with his disabilities' while prison. But they said their daughter's death in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year remained shrouded in mystery, adding that 'only Oscar knows' the truth. Miss Steenkamp's mother June told the programme: 'I think the law must take its course, we have to accept what has happened. 'If there is an appeal, well, there is an appeal. There is nothing we can change about that. But it will be difficult to go on even further, again. 'We may not feel that justice has been done, but we have just got to accept what the judge decided. Killer: Pistorius, 27, known as the Blade Runner, sits in the dock after he handed a five-year prison term at Pretoria High Court for shooting Miss Steenkamp dead on Valentine's Day last year . Disgraced: The Paralympian is led down to the cells before being driven off to prison. The sentence has been criticised by some as too lenient and sparked calls for it to be increased . 'That's the law, although it could have been completely different if her decision was different. 'Not everyone is entirely happy. But ... the facts that she had before her maybe weren't enough. But we have to live.' Mrs Steenkamp said the family had been 'disappointed in her (the judge's) judgment', but felt the judge was left with few options because 'she only had certain facts before her'. Mrs Steenkamp said the family are 'very settled with the sentence'. She added: 'He has got to pay for what he has done and it is not that we want vengeance or anything, or for him to suffer with his disabilities.

'We don't want revenge, we want a fair punishment under the circumstances of his disability. 'We wouldn't have wanted him to go to jail and be abused and I feel that it is fair. 'He will realise that he can't go around doing that. He can't kill somebody like that.' Her husband Barry said: 'We have gone along with the judge and her decision. 'Only Oscar knows whether that sentence is acceptable to him. I've got my feelings to the whole thing. 'But we do accept what the judge handed down.'","Paralympian coping 'so far so good' when visited by a prison official in jail .

"Australian triathlon legend Jackie Fairweather was always striving for perfection and didn't realise what a difference she made to the world of sport, according to Triathlon Australia CEO Anne Gripper. The Perth-born 46-year-old, who was grappling with crippling depression,  tragically took her own life on Sunday. Ms Gripper,  a personal friend of both Jackie and her husband Simon, said the Commonwealth Games bronze medallist and world champion, battled with her contribution to the sport and 'was always challenging herself to be better'.

Ms Gripper wanted to acknowledge Jackie's hard work within the industry and the huge influence she had on the world of triathlon. 'Like a typical athlete and as a world champion striving for perfection, she never really thought she had made a big enough contribution to the sport,' Ms Gripper said. 'She was very keen to do anything she possibly could,' Ms Gripper said. 'From a sport perspective, I just want to acknowledge the contribution she made, particularly when things weren't going so well for the sport,' she continued.

"Au natural: Clover Stroud sometimes showers as infrequently as twice a week . A girlfriend kept me waiting for coffee the other morning, eventually bustling into the cafe trailing a cloud of expensive-smelling body lotion and damp apple-scented hair, gushing apologies she'd had to 'jump in the shower' before she could leave the house. Sipping my lukewarm cappuccino, I resisted the urge to confide I hadn't had a shower for three days, and my blow-dry was a week old. If she was to sniff my hair she'd smell - well, my hair. Confessing I don't shower every day - in fact, why don't I admit that sometimes I can shower as infrequently as twice a week - feels like I'm breaking one of the last great taboos. Perhaps this is because daily, and even twice-daily showers, have become the norm for many. Smelling perfumed all over is seen as the ultimate expression of feminine allure. This, in my opinion, is a load of smelly hog-wash, because if you met me, you'd never guess I'm one of the great unwashed. I don't stink, people don't back away, handkerchief to nose when I walk in the room and neither do I look grubby. My hair always looks healthy and glossy and my skin crystal-clear, but a daily shower isn't something I slavishly factor into my morning ritual, even though I have many girlfriends who rise an hour before their family to scrub, blow-dry and chemically spritz themselves to a state of fragranced perfection. While you might raise your nose in disgust at the thought of sharing airspace with such an unashamed soap dodger, the dirty truth is I'm not alone. A whopping 41 per cent of men and 33 per cent of women don't shower daily, according to a survey this week by tissue manufacturer SCA, while 12 per cent have a proper scrub only twice a week. All of which is music to my less-than-squeaky-clean ears. I'm not an advocate of dirt, but there's a difference between keeping clean and covering yourself in gallons of water and products every day. Sometimes a good old-fashioned, stand-up sink wash is all you need to maintain basic standards of hygiene, and you'd be surprised how long you can go between hair washes if you put your mind to it. Every night I brush my hair with a natural bristle brush which removes the concentration of natural oil from the roots, where it tends to gather and make hair look greasy. I've also discovered that when I'm not exercising, if I simply splash water under my arms, I seem to produce less sweat than when I spray myself with endless antiperspirants. So, yes, some days I don't put any deodorant on at all. It took a bit of courage to try at first, but it really works. I noticed our obsession with feminine cleanliness in Boots. Gone are the days when a bar of Pears soap and bottle of Timotei counted as a passable cleansing regime, as it did for my mother's generation. I found myself assaulted by thousands of fragranced cleansers, gels and lotions designed to rid my body of the suggestion it was anything other than a perfumed, polished temple of loveliness. Women spend millions of pounds trying to get rid of - or at best mask - our natural aromas, as if being human and female is somehow dirty. From foot deodorisers and mouthwashes to 'intimate wipes', there is no part of our body allowed to smell as nature intended. Who knows the financial cost of all this preening. But the price to the planet is high, with the average person estimated to use 150 litres of water every day. I started cutting back on showers a year ago when I noticed my skin feeling dry after bathing. Initially, I compensated by slapping on moisturiser, but the problem only got worse. Soap dodgers: Both Prince Harry and Jessica Simpson are said to prefer using dry, rather than liquid, shampoo . I now know some dermatologists believe daily cleansing with hot water and chemical-rich soaps, rather than nourishing the skin, strips it of the essential oils that keep it soft. Without daily showers, my skin began to feel more supple, and my hair - which I now washed no more than twice a week - looked better than it had done in years. I'd been washing it every day since I was a teenager in the Eighties. I blame Wash & Go, which hit the market as I hit adolescence. With its combined cleanser and conditioner, it was so quick and easy to use it encouraged a generation to wash their hair daily. Little did I know that by doing this I'd also been depleting my hair's natural sebum - the oil our scalps secrete to fight bacteria - and it reacted by producing more of it. The result? A frustrating cycle of greasy hair however often I washed it. It wasn't until a camping trip last summer that my husband noticed my hair looked fresher and sexier now it was being washed less. 'Without daily showers, my skin began . to feel more supple, and my hair - which I now washed no more than twice . a week - looked better than it had done in years.' I decided to carry on with this approach once we got home and have saved a fortune on shampoo. It was then a natural progression to cut out some showers altogether. I spend the time I've gained every morning doing something I enjoy, like wallowing in bed. According to Elizabeth Shove, professor of sociology at Lancaster University, daily showering is a modern obsession. She points out that showers were only fitted into UK bathrooms in significant numbers in the Seventies. Prior to that, in most households bathtime came once a week. 'It's amazing how quickly daily showering became normal, even though it isn't about getting clean, because it takes more than 24 hours for dirt to accumulate,' she says. 'Instead, the daily shower has shifted in meaning from cleanliness to freshness and invigoration, so that showering's now a part of waking up rather than actually getting clean.' More worryingly, the water and products we slather ourselves with might be doing harm, she says. Alternative health practitioner Jo Kuszmar says: 'Water in cities is packed with chemicals, and hard water is harsh on the skin. 'Combine that with many of the chemical-heavy “cleansing products” on the market, and your daily shower could represent a toxic attack on the natural structure of your skin.' Kuszmar believes excessive showering and exfoliation could be linked to the apparent rise in sensitive skin conditions such as psoriasis. In hot water: 41% of men and 33% of women have revealed they don't shower daily, while 12% have a proper scrub only twice a week . 'The chemicals in water and cleansing products are relatively harmless used alone, but we don't understand their effects on health and wellbeing when they react with one another,' she says. It's even more sinister to learn researchers at the University of Reading have raised concerns about a possible link between parabens, the chemicals used as preservatives in many shampoos and cleansers, and breast cancer. Maggie MacDonal, of Environmental Defence, which educates people on environmental issues affecting their daily life, says: 'Parabens mimic human hormones, specifically oestrogen. Considering some breast cancers are tied to oestrogen exposure, it's advisable to avoid oestrogen-mimicking chemicals in cosmetics.' But my decision to ditch my daily shower isn't just about saving time, money and natural resources. I prefer being slightly unwashed. My skin looks tighter, and my thick and often unmanageable hair behaves better. I even skipped a wash on my wedding day last year, since squeaky clean hair is impossibly slippery to put up. I felt sexier and more myself. Smell also played a huge role in my initial attraction to my husband. I find the fresh scent of a real man far more attractive than the most expensive aftershave. I'd far rather snuggle up to him when he smells of himself, rather than of chemical cleansers, and he says the same about me. And let's not forget bed-head hair is considered sexy. Kate Moss, Kirsten Dunst, Chloe Sevigny, and Mischa Barton - none of these sirens have super-groomed glossy hair. Perhaps, like me, they are happy in their own skin. That's why I won't be going back to washing every day. In an over-processed world, I believe it's good to be a little bit human.","Like Prince Harry, Clover doesn't wash her hair very often .

'I love the smell of napalm in the morning’ from Apocalypse Now, ‘Love means never having to say you’re sorry’ from Love Story and ‘The stuff that dreams are made of’ from The Maltese Falcon, were not even up for consideration. 'He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy': The Life Of Brian quip, spoken by Brian's mother - played by Terry Jones - came in fourth in the top ten greatest movie quotes . Not even considered: Robert Duvall uttered the immortal line 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning,' in the Vietnam war classic Apocalypse Now, which didn't even feature in the Radio Times poll . Last out of the 50 was the famous line from Hitchcock’s thriller Psycho: ‘A boy’s best friend is his mother’, which picked up just one vote from the 2,500 cast in total. The other famous lines in the top ten were ‘He’s not the Messiah. He’s a very naughty boy’ from Monty Python’s The Life of Brian which came in fourth. It was spoken by Brian’s mother, played by Terry Jones, and is one of a series of jokes in which Brian is mistaken for Jesus. Next came ‘You’re going to need a bigger boat’ from Steven Spielberg’s Jaws and Gone with the Wind’s ‘Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn’. Carry On Cleo’s: ‘Infamy, infamy, they’ve all got it in for me’ came in seventh, beating Blade Runner’s ‘All those moments will be lost in time… like tears in rain’. ‘Nobody’s perfect’ from Some Like It Hot and ‘We want the finest wines available to humanity. And we want them here, and we want them now’ from Withnail & I came ninth and tenth respectively. Just missing out was ‘Bond. James Bond’, first uttered in 1962’s Dr No by Sean Connery. Film critic Barry Norman, who worked with the magazine on the poll, revealed his favourite quote to be ‘Daddy! My Daddy!’ from the end of The Railway Children, claiming it ‘always brings a tear to my eye’. However, even this didn’t make it onto the final list. Mr Norman, who hosted the BBC’s The Film Programme from 1972 until 1998, said: ‘For me the power of words in films is just as great as that of visual images and helps to stamp the movie in my memory. 'And certain lines have a potent effect on me, however many times I hear them. For instance, I have to confess that Jenny Agutter’s “Daddy! My Daddy!” at the end of The Railway Children always brings a tear to my eyes.’ He said the success of the Toy Story line suggests many younger cinemagoers voted and, ‘reflects the continuing popularity of films as emotional and intellectual entertainment’. He added: ‘Therein, perhaps, lies a message for television programmers: the audience – or at least the thinking part of it, which I believe is greater than most programmers seem to acknowledge – is just as interested in the content and quality of the films themselves as they are in interviews with the stars’.","Third place is Scarface's 'Say hello to my little friend'

"It was a stunning goal that will live long in the memory - Robin van Persie soaring through the air to head Holland level in their World Cup opener against defending champions Spain. Here, from Daley Blind's inch-perfect 50-yard ball from the flank to his exuberant high-five celebration with coach Louis van Gaal on the sidelines, here's the goal step-by-step. A routine ball out from the back comes to Daley Blind who controls the ball, takes another touch and looks up to Van Persie calling for the ball . The Manchester United striker spots an opportunity with Gerard Pique jeopardising Spain’s high line by dropping back to mark Arjen Robben, Blind’s most likely target . With Van Persie sprinting for space, Blind gambles and hits a 51-yard pass from the left-hand touchline in search of his side’s chief goal-getter . Van Persie knows by now that he is Blind’s intended target and he darts away from a surprised Sergio Ramos, who is left trailing in his wake . With Ramos’ marking now an afterthought, Van Persie is on his own as he reaches the edge of the area. But with Blind’s ball coming in a couple of yards ahead of him he recognises that he needs to improvise . Iker Casillas comes off his line to help deal with the danger of Van Persie running through, only to realise that the Dutchman is certain to get there first . Van Persie throws himself, head first, at the ball as it comes across him and makes contact that most would struggle to control from 15 yards out . The 30-year-old centre forward’s header brilliantly floats above the Spanish ‘keeper with van Persie watching on as he falls to the floor . Casillas can only watch on as the header drops beneath the crossbar and nestles neatly in the back of his net . Van Persie, by now sprawled on the ground, watches his wondergoal cross the line before jumping up to celebrate with Louis van Gaal on the touchline .","Daley Blind pinged a 51-yard ball from wide left to Van Persie .

"A respected California drama teacher stands to lose his job after appearing in a web series with some former students that showed him smoking marijuana. Christian Kiley, a teacher at Etiwanada High School in Rancho Cucamonga since 2005, played a homeless man in a teaser for the upcoming amateur pilot, called Skidz, and was seen dragging for a marijuana joint. After the trailer was posted to YouTube on August 20, the school started receiving complaints, and Kiley was placed on leave as the school district investigated the clip. However Kiley said the show was fictitious, the cigarette he smoked was herbal, and sees no reason why he can't have his job back. Scroll down for video . 'It shouldn't be an issue': Etiwanda High School drama teacher Christian Kiley says his decision to act in an amateur web series with some former students should not cost him his job . Write caption here . Fictitious: The creators of web series Skidz recast the role of a homeless originally played by their former teacher Christian Kiley with another actor (center) 'I'm mystified and perplexed by the way this has gone down,' Kiley told CBS Los Angeles. 'I think the example I'm trying to set for my students is to avoid artistic complacency and get out and do things.' 'I understand the need to have precautionary measures and the need to protect children but in this instance, and because it's former students and because it's within my right to freedom of artistic expression, I feel like it shouldn't be an issue.' The trailer at the center of the problem has been removed from the internet. According to The Daily Bulletin, it had been live on an age-protected YouTube channel for 15 hours and had been viewed 65 times before it was pulled down. The creators of the 'comedic' series - who hope it will be picked up by a cable network - re-shot the scenes that featured Kiley with another actor. Resolution: Christian Kiley, seen here in an interview with a CBS reporter, said he misses his students and just wants his job back . Support: A Facebook page set up to help Kiley get his job back has been gathering supporters . Riley has been off work for five weeks. The school district has not commented on the incident, which they say remains under investigation. A Facebook page called Reinstate Christian Kiley at Etiwanda High School had 702 supporters as of Thursday. Kiley's attorney, William Trejo, said it is an infringement of Kiley's free speech. 'If he had done the same thing in a popular TV series, like Breaking Bad, would they be attempting to terminate him as they are doing so today?' Trejo told CBS. Skidz will be released on YouTube, without an appearance by Kiley, on October 2.","Christian Kiley has been a drama teacher at Etiwanda High School in Rancho Cucamonga since 2005 .

"Fred lit the fuse for another Brazilian victory as the World Cup hosts signed off preparations with a sturdy but certainly not spectacular 1-0 win over Serbia in Sao Paulo. Six days away from opening the World Cup on the other side of the city against Croatia, Luis Felipe Scolari's side endured a frustrating first-half that ended with the crowd on their backs. But a much improved showing after the break - with Chelsea's Willian shining after replacing the unimpressive Oscar - saw them narrowly home. To the rescue: Fred scored the only goal of the game in Brazil's final warm-up before the World Cup . Fred flicked the ball home in the 58h minute to open the scoring at Morumbi Stadium . Helpless: Branislav Ivanovic watches on but can't prevent the Brazilian forward from scoring . Brazil: Julio Cesar, Dani Alves (Maicon 71), Luiz, Thiago Silva, Marcelo (Maxwell 74), Gustavo, Paulinho (Fernandinho 64), Oscar (Willian 46), Hulk, Fred (Jo 75), Neymar. Subs Not Used: Jefferson, Dante, Henrique, Ramires, Hernanes, Bernard, Victor. Goals: Fred 58. Serbia: Stojkovic (Lukac 88), Basta (Tomovic 86), Ivanovic, Aleksandar Mitrovic, Kolarov, Dusko Tosic, Matic, Jojic, Tadic (Zoran Tosic 69), Petrovic (Mrdja 86), Markovic (Gudelj 81). Subs Not Used: Pejcinovic, Djuricic, Stefan Mitrovic, Ljajic, Bisevac, Vulicevic, Lazovic, Brkic. Booked: Petrovic, Matic. Att: 67,042 . Ref: Enrique Caceres (Paraguay). On a sodden Sao Paulo afternoon when a . subway strike crippled the metropolis of 20 million people, World Cup . cheer wasn't exactly flowing freely on the streets. But at Morumbi, the . 67,042 packed into the home of Sao Paulo FC formed a yellow wall of . noise to welcome their front-liners, six days before they begin their . quest for history. One of . the few criticisms of Scolari is that he can be loyal to a fault but . with this staring XI - the very definition of tried and trusted - it is . hard to criticise. Sculpted during last summer's barnstorming run to the . Confederations Cup title, Scolari could have named it for the opener a . full year out. The wonder is that the 2002 World Cup winning coach, who . has always had a lucky streak, has made it to six days out without a . single injury concern over any of his starters. Being . able to reunite Thiago Silva and David Luiz at the heart of the . defence, after the skipper missed Tuesday's romp against Panama, would . have been a relief too. Scolari's Brazil have never lost under the . pairing, winning ten of the previous 12 and keeping six clean sheets. On the move: Neymar (right) fights for the ball with Serbia's Dusan Basta . Challenge: Brazilian forward Neymar is closed down by Chelsea's Ivanovic . But . vital as captain Silva may be to the cause there was no doubting who . the near full house were here to see. Neymar left his home of Sao Paulo . after the Confederations Cup to try to do in Europe what he had done . here for five years previously with Santos - electrify. If his first . season at Barcelona only featured glimpses of that talent, his adoring . masses here didn't care. From . his first touch, the roars rolled around Morumbi's bowl. It took just . five minutes for him to make a first opponent look silly, Milos Jojic . hacking him down after being outfoxed. There . were to be only intermittent moments like that in the opening period as . the World Cup hosts struggled to find the rhythm and incision that . carved Panama to pieces. It was left to Manchester City's Aleksandar . Kolarov who fired the game's first shot in anger wide of Julio Cesar's . post 11 minutes in. Physical: Hulk (left) is brushed off by former Manchester United winger Zoran Tosic . Tactics: Brazil's coach Luiz Felipe Scolari gives instructions to Real Madrid left back Marcelo . Another . of the visitors' Premier League contingent, the giant Nemanja Matic, was . making his presence felt in midfield and when the Chelsea man crossed . for Aleksandar Mitrovic soon after the half hour, the lone frontman . should have done better instead of flashed his header wide. Save . for a nice turn and shot from Fred at the other end and and a David . Luiz free-kick that sailed high into the Sao Paulo sky, there was little . to cheer for a crowd that are notoriously fickle. The jeers that rung . around the arena at Enrike Kaseres' half-time whistle left Scolari's . crew in little doubt that six days before they face Croatia in the same . city, this was not good enough. Two . days after the birth of a baby daughter, the out of sorts Oscar was . withdrawn at the inter Willian on the other hand is a man in form, well . out of national team contention just 12 months ago, he now finds himself . the go-to guy off the bench. And he immediately added some much needed . spark to proceedings. The crowd were still not convinced though, . bizarrely chanting the name of Sao Paulo FC striker Luis Fabiano - long . since out of national team reckoning. Partisan: Brazilian fans in Sao Paulo cheer their team's last game before the World Cup . Passionate: The Sao Paulo crowd booed their team off at half-time after an uninspiring first period . Maybe . that was the spur for current No.9 though as less than five minutes . later it was Fred who finally broke the deadlock. Thiago Silva angled a . ball to the edge of the box where the Fuminense man outmuscled Branislav . Ivanovic and Dusko Tosic, controlled and in spite of losing his footing . and fired into the far corner. It . was a goal that was all down to strength and endeavour, what the . sometimes criticised frontman is all about. It was also the cue for a . festa in the stands, Mexican waves and chants ringing around the place . in the last half hour. Message: Serbia players held up a banner as the two teams lined up before the game . Jojic . almost broke up the party on 69 minutes but missed a great opening with . a poor header and Lazar Markovic tamely shot at Julio Cesar soon after. At the other end Hulk had a . second wrongly disallowed for offside after a superb through ball by . Neymar but it did little to delate the atmosphere. The biggest roar of . the night went up on 80 minutes as Neymar was withdrawn. It . might not have been a vintage night from him and it may not have been a . vintage night from his team but Brazil still got it done. They will . return here on Thursday with momentum.

"Luis Suarez has England in his sights and will be determined to condemn Roy Hodgson and Co to an early exit from the World Cup now he has recovered from knee surgery. He is one of the best I played alongside during my career and here’s why he could give England nightmares. ‘A’ for attitude . He is one of the most driven players in world football and his appetite for work is incredible. Luis has been involved in a tournament for each of the past five summers — two World Cups, the Olympics, the Confederations Cup and the Copa America — but a punishing schedule won’t slow him down. Luis constantly flies in the face of what you would expect to be normal and that has been shown by the way he’s fought to get himself ready for this contest. The operation he had on his knee should have meant a six-week lay-off but he has defied medics by shaving time off his rehabilitation . VIDEO All Star XI: Luis Suarez . Driven to succeed: Luis Suarez, in training with Uruguay, has an incredible appetite for work . Playing through the pain barrier: The way Suarez has fought to get himself fit is not normal . In the running: Suarez is expected to play against England - and he certainly looks up for it (right) We used to see players go into the . treatment room at Melwood with the slightest tweak but Luis will push . himself through the pain barrier time and again. All he wants to do is have a ball at his feet and be on the training ground. That approach is what sets him apart. Once he’s gone, forget it . I . wouldn’t say Luis has speed like Daniel Sturridge or Raheem Sterling . but he rarely gets caught when he gets on the wrong side of a defender . and he scored goals against Tottenham and Everton at Anfield last season . to prove that — leaving Phil Jagielka and Michael Dawson chasing in . vain. The thing that makes . him so difficult to pull back is his tremendous strength and the way he . uses his upper body as a shield to hold off defenders — you think you . can get a foot in on him but he is elusive and always has the edge when . he wriggles away. He is the best in the world at doing that. Up to speed: Suarez outpaces Phil Jagielka to score for Liverpool against Everton last season . The finished product . His . finishing has improved dramatically in the last three years. When . Liverpool signed him in January 2011, I thought we were signing a good . player but I was  cautious because scoring lots in Holland didn’t equate . to scoring lots in the Barclays Premier League. Dirk . Kuyt, for instance, did a great job for Liverpool but he didn’t score . as regularly as for Feyenoord. Afonso Alves went to Middlesbrough with a . massive reputation but couldn’t do on Teesside what he had done for . Heerenveen. There was a . feeling early on that Suarez might need three or four opportunities to . score. I remember in Brendan Rodgers’ first game against West Brom in . August 2012 he wasted a hatful, but since that day he hasn’t looked back . and his conversion rate last season was excellent. He . can score any type of goal from anywhere on the pitch at any time in . the game. One of my favourites of his was the sublime chest control and . deft finish against Newcastle in November 2012. Luis is so good now that . it actually comes as a surprise when he misses. Favourite finish: Suarez walks the ball into an empty net against Newcastle after a sublime piece of control . Genius at work . Luis . is in the top five or six players in the world as he does extraordinary . things. As soon as we started training with him, it was clear he was . the real deal and he did things that would take your breath away. He . has made an art out of nutmegs. You think you can stop him, you know . what he is trying to do, but in a flash the ball will go through your . legs and he is away. I have watched his dribble past four  Manchester . United defenders in March 2011 countless times but I still don’t know . how he did it. The game that . provided ultimate proof of his brilliance was a 5-2 win at Fulham in . May 2011. Maxi Rodriguez scored a hat-trick but Luis was unplayable and . man of the match. I said after that he was one of the best in the . Premier League. Now it is beyond dispute he’s one of the finest on the planet. How did he do that? Suarez is the King of the nutmeg and somehow beat four Manchester United players here . A glimmer of hope? The first thing Jagielka and Gary Cahill will have to be wary of is getting too tight to Luis. If . you try to do that, he will just hold off you and then run away with . the ball at his feet; if you try to close him down too quickly, he’ll . slip the ball through your legs. It . is best, then, to either power into him with a tackle as he is on the . half-turn when taking possession, or jockey him and run backwards. Concentration . is vital as one lapse and he will be away. Of all the players I watched . against him last year, West Ham’s Winston Reid coped with him best. It . would be pointless for England to think, though, that they can rough . him up. You can’t intimidate him with a kick and he thrives with a . physical battle. For a defender now, there is no more difficult task in football than marking an on-song Luis Suarez. Reid the game: England's defenders should look and see how Winston Reid coped with Suarez .","Luis constantly flies in the face of what you would expect to be normal .

"Uruguay striker Luis Suarez has urged fans to remain calm as they prepare for a crunch clash with England on Thursday. A surprise defeat by Costa Rica in their opening match - which Suarez sat out as he continues his recuperation from minor knee surgery last month - has left the South Americans in real danger of not qualifying for the knockout stages.

"A decade ago, executives at TK Maxx were informed that their bid to open a flagship store at London’s famous Piccadilly Circus had been denied. At that point, the discount clothing chain wasn’t deemed 'posh' enough for such a prestigious location. Five years later, though, TK Maxx secured a prime position on Kensington High Street — and now the firm’s executives must be patting themselves on their backs. For they have really hit marketing gold thanks to pictures of Prince Harry leaving the store with his own bag of cut-price bargains, which included a hoodie, a T-shirt and a mobile phone cover. Bargain hunter: Prince Harry leaves the High Street Kensington branch of TK Maxx with his discount haul . And he’s not the only one to give the cheap-as-chips chain the royal seal of approval — Kate Middleton has also been spotted in the Kensington branch, as has Harry’s ex Chelsea Davy. Former model Jodie Kidd and actress Tamsin Egerton have scouted for bargains there, too. On the surface, a TK Maxx store looks a bit like a disorganised jumble sale, but for those in the know, it can be a style mecca. For the shopper with time, patience and a discerning eye, thousands of designer brands can be found crammed inside. Savvy customers can snap up this season’s styles at up to 60 per cent off the normal retail price, if they know what they are looking for and when to look for it. The stock is diverse, ranging from old pieces from two to three seasons ago (a lifetime in the fashion world) to up-to-the minute excess stock from designer boutiques, from labels such as Chloe, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. Posher High Street favourites like French Connection, All Saints and Reiss can also be picked up at knock-down prices. TK Maxx also brokers deals to buy up excess factory stock — which, while including things that simply didn’t sell well in High Street or designer stores, also includes gorgeous must-have items in one-off sizes. New deliveries arrive at stores around the country every day, with one fifth of the total stock replaced each week. Fan: The Duchess of Cambridge is known to shop at TK Maxx . Discount: Despite her rich family, Chelsy Davy loves a bargain . Fan: Polo player and former model Jodie Kidd loves TK Maxx . There are no stock rooms — so what you see is what they’ve got. The daily delivery goes straight out on the shop floor. This is why the smartest shoppers queue patiently outside each morning. And the randomness of what’s delivered is half of the fun of shopping in these chaotic, brightly-lit warehouses. 'The store managers never know what is coming in until they throw open the doors of the lorry,' reveals the brand’s press officer Evelyn Morton. 'We lay our stores out very differently from other brands, organising everything by department, category and size — so a lady looking for a size 14 sundress should go to head for the dress rails and look through the selection of size 14s.' What she doesn’t mention is the fact that in the scrum to find a designer bargain, lots of stock ends up scattered all over the place. You have to be tenacious to be a TK Maxx shopper. The stores tend to be located in the less salubrious corners of town centres or on retail parks and have relatively spartan interiors, while separate departments all merge into one chaotic whole, and customer service can leave a lot to be desired. TK Maxx languished near the bottom of a recent Which survey on the best and worst customer service at the UK’s major retail stores. But it’s the no-frills experience that helps keep its prices incredibly low. So how can you make the most of TK Maxx? Turning up for a random rummage really isn’t going to cut it in TK land. First, you have to choose your location wisely. The stock is tailored to the demographic of the local area — only 24 of the 260 UK stores stock the much-coveted Gold Label line, for example. This includes high-priced designer brands such as Alberta Ferretti, Balenciaga and Calvin Klein. Visit the store’s website (tkmaxx.com) to find out if a store near you stocks it. Second, be smart about what you buy. Stylist magazine’s fashion director Alexandra Fullerton, who is a huge fan, snaps up designer denim like True Religion, 7 for all Mankind and James Jeans for £50 a pair — they cost around £150 in high-end department stores. Red and white Costume National dress, £349.99, (saving £1,150), pink and black Giuseppe Zanotti patent heels, £149.99, (saving £216) Tweed and Nude Alexander McQueen jumpsuit, £399.99, (saving £1,525), Giuseppe Zanotti nude patent heels, as before . Red Costume National Jacket, £349.99, (saving £449), Tommy Hilfiger jeans, £39.99, (saving £60), red Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, £159.99, (saving £278) Gold Diane von Furstenberg gown, £169.99, (saving £730), black patent Giuseppe Zanotti heels, £159.99, (saving £253) Sunglasses are also a smart buy as they generally have a large array of different brands — from Police to Prada — at a fraction of their original price. Childrenswear — and the toys section — can be a gold mine. Navigate your way past the gaudy fluorescent tutus and logo-heavy kidswear and you can pick up Stella McCartney Kids, Ralph Lauren and Armani pieces, as well as wooden toys from cult brand Melissa & Doug, for around £10. The store also stocks niche hard-to-find French brands such as Petit Bateau and Antik Batik —and as stock often arrives on its original hangers you can spot these treasures a mile off if you know what you are looking for. As a TK Maxx devotee, I would advise shoppers to avoid the accessories, shoes and leather goods departments, which all seem to be at the cheaper end of the spectrum and offer few designer steals. But do make a beeline for the beauty department, where luxury shampoos and conditioners are a quarter of the price you’ll pay in any High Street shop. The menswear departments have decent offerings, including good sportswear staples from Lacoste and Lyle & Scott, and stacks of underwear from Calvin Klein, DKNY, Pringle and Emporio Armani. But for many shoppers — myself included — it’s the home department that delivers the bargains you’ll love. Here, it’s easy to find fabulous named brands and classic design that will give friends the impression you’ve lavished thousands on your home. These pieces don’t date like clothes do, which makes it astonishing to find them so generously discounted. This week, in an impromptu visit to my local store in Wimbledon, I found crystal wine glasses from Dartington, stacks of Le Creuset roasting dishes and Denby china — all at half their normal price. The store is great for designer bedlinen too. Not all stores have brilliant homes departments but TK Maxx has 26 separate HomeSense stores across the UK, where home-loving bargain hunters can kit out their homes like an interiors magazine. But it’s still the womenswear which creates the biggest buzz at TK Maxx. Amanda Bellan, fashion director at InStyle magazine, says she was rewarded for her diligent shopping at TK Maxx recently with coats from Kenzo and Jil Sander, both discounted by up to £1,000. 'You need to shop there regularly to discover the gems as stock changes so quickly,' she says, adding that the store’s online shop (which also updates with new stock every day) is one way of snapping up a bargain without the slog of shopping in-store — and is also handy if there’s not a Gold Label store near you. One thing all TK Maxx fans agree on is that you must buy something when you see it: nothing hangs around for long. Like sifting for gold, you need time and patience to rummage through the rails, but there are amazing bargains to be found — just ask Prince Harry. All clothes were picked up at the High Street Kensington branch of TK Maxx.

"Michael Jordan has asked a Georgia court to dismiss a lawsuit filed against him by a woman who says the NBA hall of famer is the father of her 16-year-old son. Jordan's lawyer John Mayoue said in the document filed Monday in Fulton County Superior Court that the six-time NBA champion is not the father of Pamela Smith's son. Jordan accused her of making false claims against him. The NBA's Charlotte Bobcats majority owner said the paternity of the teen has already been 'conclusively established' in divorce filings between Smith and her ex-husband. Scroll down for video . 'Father and son': Mr Jordan with Taj, who claims to be the son of the former sports star, though his birth certificate has another man's name . Technicality: Pamela Smith, left, withdrew her paternity suit against Michael Jordan, right, while maintaining the truth of her claims . Jordan, 50, released a statement to . The Associated Press on Monday through his spokeswoman Estee Portnoy . saying, 'Public records show that the paternity of the child was . established in a prior case in this same court many years ago and that . Michael Jordan is not the father. 'He also filed a counterclaim seeking . sanctions for the false claims made against him. It is unfortunate that . well-known figures are the target of these kind of claims. Michael . Jordan will vigorously defend himself and his reputation.' Jordan's response to Smith's Feb. 6 lawsuit said her suit is a 'shameless, bad faith attempt to abuse the legal system.' Last week Smith claimed that she only decided to sue the star only after . her 16-year-old son, Taj, begged her to file the suit. The . teen, who uses the surname Jordan, has in the past taken to the . internet to insist that the former Chicago Bulls star is his father. According to TMZ, the woman was . hesitant to bring Jordan's name through the mud but her teenage son . begged his mother do everything she could to get Jordan to acknowledge . that the boy was his son. Questionable: The original suit against Jordan was dropped, but Pamela Smith has promised to refile after legal oversight . In . the legal documents, she claims that she and Mr Jordan had sex in 1995, . when he was married to Juanita Vanoy, with whom he has three children. She says her son Grant Pierce Jay Jordan Reynolds, known as Taj, was born in June 1996. Ms . Smith insists that Mr Jordan is the boy's father, and argues in the . court documents that he should be forced to undergo a paternity test and pay child support. She also requested the boy's last name be changed to Jordan, and for a judge to order the Georgia Department of Vital Records to issue him a new birth certificate. The lawsuit requests that any hearing or trial be conducted in closed court to protect the teen's privacy. However, Smith's publicist acknowledged that the teen posted a video to YouTube on Dec. 25, saying Jordan is his father and that he wants him to play a larger role in his life. Testimony: Taj, who uses the last name Jordan, has taken to Youtube to insist his father is the legendary athlete . Affection: The Georgia-based, 16-year-old aspiring rapper is pictured with his mother . Appeal: Taj has said he wants Mr Jordan to be more involved with his life . 'Pamela had no choice but to support . her son and his desire to forge a relationship with his father,' Smith's . publicist, April Love, said in a statement Friday. 'That's why she is . now speaking out and prompting Michael to do the right thing.' Love said Smith, 48, and Jordan met . in Chicago in the late 1980s. According to court documents, Smith does . not have an attorney. A court date is scheduled for Tuesday, March 12. Jordan is scheduled is marry fiancée Yvette Prieto next month . The star remains one of the most . recognized sports figures in the world nearly 10 years after his . retirement from the NBA and is considered by many to be the greatest basketball player of all time. Engaged: Jordan is pictured with his fiancée Yvette Prieto, whom he is set to marry April 27 . Heyday: The basketball legend is seen playing for the Chicago Bulls during his heyday in 1988 . He was a 14-time NBA all-star, won six championships with the Chicago Bulls and was named the finals MVP six times. On March 17, 2010, the NBA Board of . Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase of the Bobcats, making . him the first former NBA player ever to become the majority owner of a . league franchise.

"Morgan Schneiderlin feels Southampton can hang on to second place in the Premier League, and possibly even catch leaders Chelsea. Ronald Koeman's side have won seven of their last eight league fixtures and are just four points adrift of unbeaten leaders Chelsea in second spot. 'For a few games now there has been a lot of expectation and we responded well,' the 24-year-old told Southampton's official website. Southampton can catch Premier League leaders Chelsea, according to midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin . 'We are ready to kick on, we know that after Saturday we are going to have another break, the mood is very good but we know it can change very quickly. 'It is important to us before the international break to have a good result against Leicester so we are able to enjoy our national duties. 'Before whatever break it is important to get a victory, but we want to keep second place and to catch Chelsea.' Schneiderlin will be looking to pick up his seventh France cap in a friendly against Albania next Friday but is remaining focused on Leicester for the time being.

Saints manager Ronald Koeman congratulates the French midfielder after their victory against Hull City . Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama have formed a formidable partnership in Southampton's central midfield . 'We need to be on our toes to win the game. Deep inside, we know we have something good to do this season, but we know we have to work hard.' Victor Wanyama is likely to partner Schneiderlin in midfield on Saturday having scored crucial goals in recent weeks and, with a fully-fit squad to choose from, Koeman is pleased to have a welcome selection headache. 'It's always a difficult situation,' he said. 'I was a footballer, I understand that kind of problem because that's difficult for the players, but all of them are acting in a professional way. 'Wanyama has scored two times in 1-0 games. That means a lot. I'm happy about all the midfield players, but sometimes one is a little bit more disappointed as they will not start the game, but that is part of the job.'

"Germany midfielder Toni Kroos is no closer to committing his own future to Bayern Munich despite the new deals given to Thomas Muller and Philipp Lahm. Muller extended his contract until 2019 with Lahm committing until 2018 last week, but Kroos, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United, where former Bayern coach Louis van Gaal takes charge next month, is still far from agreeing new terms. Kroos has already turned down Bayern's first offer and suggested more acceptable terms, but the record German champions have yet to reach a compromise with the 24-year-old.

Kroos is still tied to Bayern until 2015, but should no new agreement be reached there may be a temptation to sell the former Bayer Leverkusen midfielder this summer rather than potentially lose him on a free transfer next year.

In the meantime, Kroos is focusing on helping Germany win their first World Cup since West Germany's 1990 triumph, saying euphoria is unlikely to distract them after the 4-0 win over Portugal on Monday. They face Ghana next, in Fortaleza on Saturday. 'We don't need bringing back down to earth because we've only won one game and that's nothing compared to what we have planned,' Kroos said.

"Ski champion Bode Miller's ex-lover - who gave birth to his child last month - has filed a police report against the Olympian's wife, claiming online attacks and threatening messages. Model Sara McKenna's filing against professional volleyball player Morgan Beck, who married Miller in October, is the latest salvo in a months-long catfight between the two women. McKenna claims that she was sent a series of online messages from Beck under different accounts that threatened her and insulted her with words like 'c***' and 'bitch.' War of words: Miller's wife Morgan Beck, left, . and his ex-lover Sara McKenna's vicious Twitter war has seen threats of . arrest and police involvement . Joy: Sara announced her pregnancy on Facebook and proudly revealed what he planned to call the child . Loss: Bode Miller, with wife and volleyball star Morgan Beck. The couple had a miscarriage in January . TMZ reported that the NYPD is taking McKenna's filing seriously, and is investigating. Miller, 35, launched his fight for . joint legal and physical custody of McKenna's child just days after Beck . suffered a miscarriage. McKenna's baby was born last month. The new claims comes months after Beck publicly branded McKenna a woman who lied about being on the Pill 'to lock down a man who doesn’t want to be with her.' McKenna responds, 'No Morgan, not even the pill is 100% effective when you are having unprotected sex.' She . told TMZ at the time: 'I will be fighting this in court and will not give up . my son to somebody who did not want him to begin with.'

But already the storm between the two women was brewing. Just weeks before the wedding, McKenna posted, ‘Go take your . paternity test already Bode. I’m over the way you have been treating us. You can’t hide DNA in court documents.’ On . the same day McKenna posted a message directed at 25-year-old Beck: 'If . you make a fake Twitter to ask me questions about your new ""fiance"" at . least be clever enough not to use your cat’s name #block.' War: Last week, McKenna, pictured, filed a police report against Beck, claiming online attacks and threatening messages on Twitter . McKenna, . who describes herself as a 'Firefighter, helicopter pilot, former U.S . Marine, model and Ivy Leaguer,' claims that Miller wanted . nothing to do with the child when she first became pregnant. Now she has made it clear that she has no intention of surrendering any rights to the child’s father. In . a clear show of solidarity with her husband earlier this month Beck . informed McKenna: 'You are stuck with BOTH of us for the rest of your . life.' Miller has also . filed for joint legal and physical custody as well as child support . payments for a child by another woman - Chanel Johnson. Johnson, . now married, is the mother of Miller’s four-year-old daughter Neesyn . Dacey. According to Miller, the two are friends and he was involved in . naming the little girl.

McKenna's tweets of her pregnancy progress - . she has tweeted from the moment of the pregnancy test - must be . particularly painful for Beck. She posted the news of her miscarriage on Friday in this very public play-by-play. The battle's impact on surrounding friendships is also clear.

"England landed back in New Zealand's north island armed with a strong Test line-up and a fervent desire to stop the All Blacks' 'phenomenal' run of success against all-comers. The host nation are targeting a 17th consecutive victory on Saturday, to draw level with the world record set by their predecessors in the Sixties and matched by the Springboks in 1997-98. Their opponents harbour considerable respect for the exploits of Steve Hansen’s team – who have lost just once since the last World Cup – but they are hell-bent on halting the Kiwi juggernaut. Watching brief: The injured Owen Farrell watches on as England train ahead of the third Test . Discussion: Chris Ashton talks to skills coach, Mike Catt (left) as Stuart Lancaster looks on . Stuart Lancaster has presided over largely impressive results during his two-and-a-half years in charge of England, but he saluted the astonishing consistency of the All Blacks. Asked about their 16-in-a-row winning run, he said: 'That feat is phenomenal. They have won 35 out of 37 as well (since the last World Cup). 'To play home and away at international level against the quality of opposition they’ve played is a phenomenal record and that’s why they are No 1 in the world. Ourselves, South Africa, Australia and Wales are all striving to emulate them.' While the series has already been won by New Zealand, their crusade to set new global records and England’s determination to finish a promising tour with tangible success means that there will be no shortage of motivation going into Saturday’s Test. Lancaster outlined just how much the match will mean to his squad. 'We’ve made quite a few changes, but definitely not on an experimental basis,' said the head coach. 'It’s certainly a very important game for us. We don’t see this third game as any sort of dead rubber whatsoever; it's a hugely important game for us and New Zealand. They want to build momentum heading into the Rugby Championship and we want to finish the season strongly. 'We've had a great season all round really. We’ve been close in these two games and we want to get that win so when we play New Zealand in November we're in a strong position. It would be huge to beat the All Blacks away. All smiles: Winger Chris Ashton went through some drills with skills coach Mike Catt in Christchurch . VIDEO I'm here to play Test rugby - Dickson . 'We were in a very similar position in South Africa two years ago. We lost two Test matches, the second one quite narrowly, but dug in in the third Test and produced a very strong performance. 'That enables everyone to finish the tour on a positive note and reflect all the hard work done.' Lancaster reacted to the announcement of the All Blacks’ line-up by describing it as a ‘pretty strong team’, which was a masterpiece of under-statement. The IRB’s reigning world Player of the Year, Kieran Read, is back for the home side at No 8 and Lancaster added: 'That is a huge boost for them, he’s a world-class player and they’ll be delighted to have him back. We’re aware of his threat.' Carrying: Chris Robshaw (left) and Ashton are hoping to stop the All Blacks winning their 17th on the spin . Chase: The Kiwis are looking to level South Africa's winning record, set in 1998 . Read’s threat is substantial, but the other grave threat to English ambition is that the visitors' collective intensity and composure dips at any stage, as it did in both Auckland and Dunedin, with grim consequences. Lancaster is demanding an effective mixture of physical ferocity and calm heads from his men, as they seek a consolation prize. 'We need the full 80-minute performance to beat them,' he said.

She didn't know where her son was from November until the . present day,' her attorney, Philip Lights, said. When . Myls' father, Okee Wade, was . arrested for failing to attend court on fraud charges, he called his . girlfriend, rather than turn to any of the relatives who have been . devastated by the boy's death. Relatives told the Daily News that he is now on suicide watch in the New Jersey jail because, 'he can't bear it. He is so overcome.' Kryzie King, a transgender performer whose . real name is Janaie Jones, told police that she had been dating Myls' father for just a few months when he was arrested on December 19.

Ashlee Dobsonn asked when she was asked to identify her . son's body, the Daily News reported. 'How could this happen?' Her lawyer added that Myles had been taken from her because they had been living in a shelter. Her weekly visitations abruptly ended in November and she had not known where to find the boy, he said.

Rafaella Gibbons and teammate Maddison Larabee were completing a four-mile run in Winter Park, Florida on Monday evening when they spotted a toddler in the middle of a busy road. The two girls, who attend Winter Park High School, didn't hesitate and ran into the middle of the road to rescue the little boy.

Miss Gibbons, a freshman, told the Orlando Sentinel: 'Fortunately, there was a break in traffic. I was surprised at first. 'I thought his mother was right behind him, but she wasn't. I ran out there as fast as I could to get the boy.' Miss Larabee, a sophomore, was close behind her friend, throwing her arms up in the air to halt traffic. The girls then went to nearby houses until they found the boy's mother and returned the toddler to the distraught woman who hugged the girls in relief, the Sentinel reported. The mother was unaware that the little boy had managed to get out of the house. Their coach Kristin McWilliams told the Sentinel that she was proud of the students for their bravery. The two girls are both cross-country runners who are regularly among the top ten at races in their district.","Rafaella Gibbons and teammate Maddison Larabee were completing a four-mile run in Winter Park, Florida ."
"Liverpool is the home of the Liver Birds, the Albert Docks - and the UK's most promiscuous residents according to a new survey. Research carried out by an online pharmacy specialising in sexual health found those from Liverpool were most likely to experience a one night stand. According to the results, Liverpool topped the charts as the 'most promiscuous' place, shortly followed by Oxford and Newcastle. Spontaneous passion: 61 per cent of those surveyed admitted to having a one night stand with a stranger . The study was conducted by www.UKMedix.com as part of research into the sexual health and preferences of Britons.

"New York is losing the rat race. Citizen complaints about pests to the 311 hotline plus online reports went from 22,300 in fiscal year 2012 to 24,586 the next year, city Comptroller Scott Stringer said Sunday. 'Rats are a daily, stomach-turning insult to New Yorkers — whether they're scurrying over people's feet on the sidewalks, invading homes where children sleep or swarming through restaurants,' Stringer said of the more than 10 percent increase in one year. Common occurrence: A rat scurries around in a New York City subway . Source: New York City Comptroller's Office . Stringer said an audit conducted by his office found that the city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene isn't managing its pest control program effectively. The audit said health inspectors didn't always follow on their own protocols, and in 160 cases, no field inspection was conducted. 'Without a vigilant and timely response by the city to citizen complaints, this problem will come back to bite us again and again,' he said. A health department spokesman told New York's Daily News that the agency 'strongly disagrees' with the audit, and is taking a proactive response to exterminating pests in the city. Auditors found that in 24 percent of the cases examined, the agency did not check out complaints within its own 10-day target, Stringer said. In addition, action was stopped prematurely on some citizen complaints before the required number of inspection attempts, according to the audit. And in fiscal year 2013, there was no indication that assessments were conducted in 44 percent of 386 instances where inspectors requested cleanup services. The comptroller also reported that the department failed to notify some property owners about city orders to eliminate rodent conditions, increasing the risk that rat infestations could spread through a neighborhood. The comptroller's office recommends that the health department identify complaints that have been pending a long time, ensure complaints are not closed after only one failed attempt to gain access to a site, and make sure problems in the field have been dealt with efficiently and completely.","Citizen complaints about pests went up by 10 percent in just one year .

"Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent. In Italy, the papers are dominated by the Azzurri's 5-3 friendly win over Brazilian club giants Fluminense on Sunday. The performance of Cesare Prandelli's side in their final World Cup warm-up match before Saturday's opener against England,  has left the Italian papers purring - especially over hat-trick hero Ciro Immobile. Loud and proud: Gazeeta and Corriere both hail Italy strikers Ciro Immobile and Lorenzon Insigne . La Gazzetta dello Sport leads with a picture of the 24-year-old striker - who recently moved to Borussia Dortmund for £15.6million - and the headline: Ciro of Italy. They are also full of praise for Immobile's strike partner Lorenzo Insigne, who scored twice in the rout. They boldly declare that after such an impressive performance, Prandelli has options up front and that there is now more to Italy than Mario Balotelli. It's not all good news, however, as La Gazzetta warn that the defence is still an area of concern for Prandelli. Corriere dello Sport also hail the partnership between Immobile and Insigne. They also declare that Manchester City and Chelsea are interested in Napoli strike Jose Callejon - who played for Jose Mourinho at Real Madrid. Moving on? Tuttosport say Alvaro Morota may join Juventus while Record claim Bryan Cristante will join Benfica . Meanwhile, Tuttosport splash on Juventus' interest in Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata - who is a long-standing target of Arsenal. The paper warn the Spanish giants that the 21-year-old striker is ready to join them and that they are just waiting for the signal . They also reflect on Italy's win over Fluminense and say Prandelli was pleased with the performance of Immobile and Insigne. Interestingly, they also reportat that Kaka is ready to say goodbye to AC Milan. In Portugal, Diario Record splash on Benfica's pursuit of AC Milan midfielder Bryan Cristante who, they say, could be tempted to leave Italy in search of regular first-team football. Reports in Italy have previously suggested that Milan are reluctant to sell the player, who made his professional debut for the club aged 16 in a Champions League match in 2011 - becoming the third youngest player to play for the club.","Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne starred in Italy's 5-3 win over Fluminense .

"When Sam Faiers stepped into the Celebrity Big Brother house last week, she showcased a toned new figure in a flattering white jumpsuit. The TOWIE star lost a staggering 23lbs in the build-up the the Channel 5 show - but not without hard work. The 23-year-old, who reveals she piled on weight by comforting eating when in a relationship, has lost almost two stone on a gruelling diet and exercise regime. Sam has slimmed from 10st 2lbs at her . peak to 8st 7lbs - losing three inches off her waist and shrinking from a . size 10 to a size 8. She's the biggest loser! Sam Faiers slimmed from 10st 2lbs to 8st 7lbs - losing three inches off her waist and shrinking from a size 10 to a size 8 - in preparation for her appearance in Celebrity Big Brother . Revealing new bikini pictures taken just before she went into Big Brother, Sam said she had piled on the pounds when she was with former boyfriend Joey Essex because she enjoyed the 'comfort' of being in a relationship. In an interview with Heat magazine, Sam said: 'He was super skinny and could eat what he wanted and not put on any weight. As she was: Sam, pictured (L) in March 2012 and (R) entering the house on Friday, said she comfort ate when she was in a relationship with Joey Essex and decided to lose weight after seeing bikini shots of herself . 'It was completely different for me because the weight does quickly show on me. I've always had chubby cheeks and when I put on weight, it goes to my face, neck and tummy. My face goes a bit puffy.' She revealed the trigger point that sparked her new healthier regime was the split with Joey and some bikini pictures of her taken in Marbella in the summer. She said: 'I looked so horrible and didn't feel comfortable about my body at all. I remember seeing one picture of me eating a cheese sandwich and I just cried. I thought: ""I want to lose that tummy."" I feel like I let myself go a little bit. 'It happens when you are in a relationship - they do make you put on weight. I was very comfortable in a relationship and I guess that affected my weight. 'We'd both eat the same things and I'd end up putting on weight and he wouldn't. Comfort: Sam said she and Joey (pictured together, left) would eat lots of takeaways but he'd never put on weight. She was speaking in an interview with Heat magazine, out now . 'My weak points were Chinese takeaways - particularly my favourite chicken chow mein - and crisps and biscuits. I could easily have three digestive biscuits with a cup of tea.' Sam's heartache diet combined no carbs, little alcohol and punishing interval training three times a week with her personal trainer. She switched to healthier meals such as porridge, chicken salads and prawn stir-fries. And she has also cut out all that damaging snacking by taking Forza Supplements’ Raspberry K2 diet pills. The 5ft 6in star said: 'If I start reaching for the biscuit tin or the crisps, I just take one of the Forza K2 capsules and it satisfies my craving. They give me that little bit of extra help in getting in shape - they are like a diet in a bottle. Popular housemate: Sam is 7-2 second favourite to win Celebrity Big Brother behind Made In Chelsea star Ollie Locke whose odds are 7-4 . 'They are great when you are feeling a bit peckish in the hour before lunch or in the middle of the afternoon.' Sam - recently voted Best Bikini Body - is thrilled with her new figure. Speaking just before she went on Big Brother, Sam said: 'I just feel so much better and have lots more energy. I guess there are some good bits about being single! 'I didn't need to lose a lot of weight - I just needed to tone up my body and put a bit of muscle on. I'll always be a curvy girl and I will never be skinny. I am quite happy with that.' But her waist isn't the only thing that has shrunk. Sam has revealed how her boobs have got smaller since losing the weight, shrinking from 32DD to a 32C.

VIDEO Scroll down to see 8/10 New Zealand captain Richie McCaw speaking after the match . England . Mike Brown - 7Helped drive England forward in the final 15 when it could have gone pear-shaped. Took try well . Manu Tuilagi - 6 Showed with last try what he could offer on wing but experiment over. An outside centre going forward. Luther Burrell - 6The game didn’t flow his way and not a huge factor. Will he suffer in a possible midfield reshuffle? Down and out? Luther Burrell is tackled by Richie McCaw and may be dropped for the third Test . Billy Twelvetrees - 6 Some good, and some not so good moments. Not to blame for turnover try by New Zealand . Marland Yarde - 7Still learning. Took his try very well and was busy throughout but needs to address his kicking game. Owen Farrell - 6Yellow card was harsh but not playing as well as in the autumn. Unusually tentative in a few tackles. Underwhelming: Owen Farrell kicks for goal and is stopped by Julian Savea (right) Danny Care - 6 Made Yarde’s try superbly but first match for three weeks and kicking game looked rusty in first half. Joe Marler - 6 Not as prominent around the park as usual, mainly because it was such hard going in the tight. Rob Webber - 7 Another very fine game by the Bath man. Were England any better when Hartley came on? No. David Wilson - 7 Much tougher in the tight but good to see the return of his handling and indeed kicking game! Joe Launchbury - 7 Has been a Trojan for England but was much more tested this week against improved Kiwi front five. Powerhouse: Joe Launchbury holds off a defender and passes in field . Geoff Parling - 7 Good lineout presence, hard working — Parling is making it difficult for Lancaster to drop him. Tom Wood - 8 Hard working and competitive. After the game he insisted defeat was simply not good enough. Chris Robshaw (capt) - 7 Found Richie McCaw back at his best last night so a much more challenging match altogether . Ben Morgan - 7 Strong in the tight going forward although exposed out wide defensively occasionally. New Zealand . Ben Smith - 9Exceptional in attack and defence. Wonderful try-saving tackle on Tuilagi, brilliant try of his own. Star man: New Zealand's Ben Smith was the best player on the pitch . Cory Jane - 7The occasional fumble, still not at his very best, but remains an accomplished all round player. Conrad Smith - 8 Exceptionally gifted rugby player, world class in everything he does for New Zealand. Ma’a Nonu - 8Roared back from a substandard performance last week. Took his try well, made another for Savea. Julian Savea - 8 Probably the world’s best wing on current form. Constant threat in attack, strong in defence. Wide boy: Julian Savea showed his class in attack and defence on Saturday . Aaron Cruden - 8 Clever game manager. Saves big plays for when they are needed — witness his break for Smith’s try. Aaron Smith - 7 Quiet first half but electric when New Zealand started winning the collisions after half-time. Tony Woodcock - 7 Very testing night at the office in Auckland, more comfortable at scrum-time in the ‘House of Pane’. Dane Coles - 7Was probably playing for his place after last week but much stronger in the tight. Good lineout throwing. Much improved: Dane Coles beats the tackle of Launchbury and Marler (right) Owen Franks - 7Another under pressure after Eden Park who answered his critics with a powerful all-court performance. Brodie Retallick - 7Developing a world class combination with Whitelock. Rock solid in the lineout, good in open spaces. Sam Whitelock - 7 Never has a bad match. At the core of the pack. Particularly effective in these high-tempo games. Liam Messam - 7 A quiet grafter in a team of stars. Provides the cement but always comfortable ball in hand. Richie McCaw (capt) - 8 Recovered from missed tackle on Yarde that cost a try to start really hitting his straps in the second half. Jerome Kaino - 7 Fiery and always formidable going forward, great hands and rugby nous to make a try for Savea.","Manu Tuilagi failed to shine on the wing and should be moved back inside .

"It turned out that all we were ever going to discover in Sao Paulo is who might be the better of two moderate World Cup teams. England almost claimed that modest accolade with a second-half performance born of desperation. Then that porous left side of their defence leaked yet again and the impossible comeback of Luis Suarez materialised into all too complete a resurrection. Yet it seems inconceivable that the winners of a tournament bursting at the seams with brilliant goals and dazzling football might come out of a match like this. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Suarez's emotional dressing room message to wife and kids . Deadly: Uruguay striker Luis Suarez celebrates after scoring the winner against England . Strange things do happen, of course. Like Italy starting like a broken down old van at Spain '82 and roaring through the finishing line like a Ferrari. But while champions do tend to grow the longer they last during a World Cup, they don't usually begin as short of stature as England or Uruguay. Despite this result it still remains unclear whether either of them will make it as far as the last 16. Roy Hodgson chose to shuffle the pack rather than change any cards. Clinical: Uruguay striker Luis Suarez heads past England keeper Joe Hart . That left us to work out whether the manager, along with most of the nation, had been reading too many positives into a losing performance. Maybe so, because we still don't really know how good are Italy. And with that wonderful gift of hind-sight I have to say they did not appear as potent as the Azzurri counter-attackers of World Cups past. But for sure Uruguay were hopeless against Costa Rica. Without Suarez they were not a patch on the other South Americans. With him, they gave Joe Hart some collywobbles in England's goal. Thanks to the miracle of the wounded knee he gave them the lead . Tormentor:  Luis Suarez celebrates scoring for of Uruguay against England in Sao Paulo . Finally, unbelievably, he scored their winner. How long and how far he might carry Uruguay on one-and-a-half legs is another matter entirely. The comparison with Wayne Rooney was close to becoming embarrassing for two thirds of the night. The awkward question of how soon, if ever, Rooney might score his first World Cup finals goal remained unanswered with more than another hour of endeavour elapsed. He hits the bar. He hits the keeper. He scratches his head. So close: Rooney shot straight at the goalkeeper when he found space in the penalty area . Hodgson had given him his rightful place in the middle, albeit without improving the balance in midfield. But it all seemed worth it when that tap-in came. Just 24 hours earlier Vicente Del Bosque had paid the penalty for excessive loyalty to his preferred players. There is an element of that now for Hodgson. But the difference here of course is that England, as they try to build for a better future while still trying to put on a good show in this World Cup, do not yet possess Spain's strength in squad depth. How did he miss? Wayne Rooney powers his header against the bar from point-blank range . Tussle: England's Steven Gerrard challenges Edinson Cavani of Uruguay . Was Adam Lallana as much of an improvement on Danny Welbeck as Ross Barkley might be? Would Frank Lampard be better than Jordan Henderson? And most citically and contentiously of all, if age is catching up with the captain, has the time come for Steven Gerrard to hand over the flag of experience to Frank Lampard? After this deathly struggle, we might as well find out against Costa Rica. After all, what more do Roy’s boys have to lose? Only another football match.","Hodgson had chosen to shuffle the pack rather than change any cards after Italy defeat .

"Enner Valencia scored either side of half-time to lift Ecuador back into contention in Group E and see off Honduras. Carlos Costly had given the Hondurans the lead in Curitiba with his country's first World Cup goal since 1982. But Valencia responded with a quick equaliser before heading home the winner in the second half. Relive all the action as it happened below. Click here for Sportsmail's brilliant World Cup Match Zone . Honduras: TBA . Ecuador: TBA . Host commentator . This match promised little, but delivered a lot. It was certainly entertaining, fast and physical... if not one for the purists. You can read Craig Hope's take on proceedings with our match report HERE. Ashley Clements will be here tomorrow for Argentina v Iran at 5pm, and I'll be back for the two late games Germany v Ghana at 8pm and Nigeria v Bosnia at 11pm. In the meantime, adios. That is that. Ecuador come from behind to get the three points and rise to second place in Group E ahead of Switzerland on goal difference. Enner Valencia was the man who made the difference, scoring either side of half-time in Curitiba. Ecuador play France in their final group game at the Maracana on Wednesday while Honduras must beat Switzerland to stand any chance of progression. Changes galore as Ecuador throw on Gruezo and the experiences Mendez in an attempt to see this out. Honduras have brought on Chavez in an attempt to force an equaliser. Just six minutes to go and I wouldn't bet my house on this finishing 2-1, it's still very open in Curitiba. Honduras throw on Mario Martinez in an attempt to get back into this game. Garrido is the man who makes way. A defeat would not be the end of the road for Honduras, but they would need a healthy win over Switzerland and hope France beat Ecuador on Wednesday. Still 20 minutes to get back into this. Valencia again! Ecuador lead! The South Americans come from behind to take the lead in Curitiba. The warning signs were there for Honduras from a couple of previous crosses into the box. This time, though, another free header for an Ecuador player and Valencia makes no mistake, guiding the ball into the far corner. It will take a big effort from Honduras now to get back into this. Another one for Honduras, and again the right decision. Costly was offside from the ball played through by Espinoza. No vociferous protests this time, though, from Honduras' players. It was a decent shout for Ecuador, but none of their players really appealed for it. Caicedo found himself in behind the defence and Figueroa came in at full stretch. The Honduras defender didn't make contact with the ball, and he definitely caught Caicedo. Corner kick given. In other news, Antonio Valencia went into the book. That's about all there is to report from a rather poor first 15 minutes in the second half. It's been nothing like the first. Both managers must have had a word with their teams because the start of the second half has been far more controlled with both teams looking to keep possession. Ecuador still coming forward and moving the ball fast, but so far Honduras holding firm. 51 mins played - 1-1. Right, time for the second half in Curitiba. One change for Honduras as Wigan's Garcia replaces Celtic's Izaguirre. Well that was a pleasant surprise – end to end, toe to toe, stud to stud, call it what you may, it was entertaining stuff. Honduras have fared better than anticipated and, to give air to one well-worn phrase, this one really could go either way. A breath-taking first half full of incident in Curitiba. There has been good football, mistakes, tough challenges, cards and goals... everything we need for an enjoyable game. Having said that, a draw isn't much good to both teams as it will leave them in 3rd and 4th place respectively in this group. Still, more of the same in the second half please. Honduras though they were back ahead then. Costly's header came cannoning back off the post to Bengtson, who tapped home from two yards and ran off to celebrate. The referee's whistle went, though, and the goal was ruled out. It was the right decision, Bengtson handled the ball, and he was offside for good measure. This has been one of the more enjoyable contests I've seen at this World Cup. You can see the fight in both teams desperate for a win and the energy and physicality has made this a gripping game, as well as the mistakes. Both goals were quite sloppy from the defending teams, but that's fitting of this game. Three minutes until half-time. That didn't last long. A goal from absolutely nothing. Paredes was running with the ball and there seemed to be nothing on. Paredes shot from the edge of the area and it took a deflection before finding Enner Valencia, who had gambled at the far post and earned himself a tap in. Honduras made a lot of mistakes in the first half hour, but Ayovi makes the most costly one of all and the Hondurans lead. Ayovi lost the ball just outside his own penalty area, and Carlos Costly picked it up before smashing home low and hard past Dominguez. Honduras' first World Cup goal since 1982 and they're loving it. Ecuador slightly on top, but it's very hard to tell as this game is so stretched and frenetic. Honduras making a lot of mistakes, but both teams playing with plenty of energy and physicality. I wouldn't bet on another goalless draw in Curitiba on this evidence. And Enner Valencia has blown it. Just a long ball over the top and the Ecuador striker was played on side by Izaguirre, but Valencia volleyed wide of the far post. Huge let off for Honduras and a big warning. Shock! Within three seconds of kick-off there are three players laid out on the turf after a meaty Honduran challenge. At least if it’s a spikey affair it will be an improvement on the tedium of 24 hours ago when Japan and Greece played out a predictable stalemate. A real stretched game this one and a lively first 15 minutes. Not may chances to report so far, but that's not down to a lack of trying. I sense both teams are desperate for a win to push themselves back into contention in this group. Those of you who bet on the timing of the first card, it came after six minutes. Honduras' Bernardez the man who goes into the book for a cynical foul just outside the area on Enner Valencia. Real end-to-end stuff to begin this match as first of all Caicedo's direct running and good cross causes problems for Honduras goalkeeper Valladares. At the other end, Costly led the counter attack and his low cross had Ecuador goalkeeper Dominguez scrambling. Good atmosphere in Curitiba for this one. Both sets of supporters sense that this is their best chance of a victory. Ecuador kick us off in Curitiba... and Honduras foul within five seconds. This could be a good match to bet on card markets. Two more passionate national anthems, in keeping with the South American (central in Honduras' case) theme, completed and we're ready for kick-off in Curitiba. Real incentive for the winner today to leap into second place ahead of Switzerland. Honduras and Ecuador met in a friendly in Texas last November and it finished 2-2 on that occasion. Carlos Costly scored twice in five minutes for the Hondurans on that occasion, and Ecuador needed an 89th-minute equaliser from Enner Valencia in Houston. Please don't shut your laptop down after this, but here goes. Before France's 5-2 win over Switzerland in Salvador, the previous two games at the venue were Spain 1-5 Holland and Germany 4-0 Portugal. On the other hand, the only other game to be played in Curitiba finished Iran 0-0 Nigeria. The late game last night between Japan and Greece also finished 0-0. Things can only get better. In the words of Kevin Hart - let me explain. Both these teams played England in warm-up games in Miami. Both actually earned draws that looked very credible back then, that was until England were eliminated after two straight losses. Honduras: Valladares, Figueroa, Bernardez, Izaguirre, Bengtson, Costly, Garcia, Espinoza, Garrido, Claros, Beckeles . Ecuador: Dominguez, Guagua, Erazo, Paredes, Noboa, Montero, Ayovi, Caicedo, E. Valencia, Minda, A. Valencia. Let's be honest, when the World Cup fixtures were announced, this is probably the game that most of us decided we wouldn't stay up for. But after France smashed Switzerland in Salvador just now, both these teams will feel they are back in the mix for second place in Group E.

"The daughter of a Conservative politician who was murdered in the Brighton bombing 30 years ago has said she is friends with her father's killer. Sir Anthony Berry MP was one of five people who died when the IRA explosion ripped through the Grand Hotel on October 12, 1984. His daughter Jo now travels the world promoting peace and reconciliation with Patrick Magee - the republican bomber who planted the deadly device. 'I would say he is a friend,' she said. 'It is an unusual friendship but I care about him.' Scroll down for video . Jo Berry, daughter of Conservative politician Sir Anthony Berry,  who was murdered in the Brighton bombing 30 years ago, pictured with Patrick Magee, who planted the device, in 2004 on the 20th anniversary . Although reluctant to say she has forgiven Magee for causing her father's death, Ms Berry claimed she understood why he turned to violence three decades ago. She added: 'I don't like to use the word (forgiveness). For me it is more about empathy and understanding. And the empathy is about understanding from his perspective why he did it. 'I am always going to be against any violence but if I understand why he, and others, chose to use violence then that can help me to look at how we can make the world a place where people are less likely to use violence. 'Forgiveness is such a difficult word. But he is my friend now. We spend a lot of time together.' Thirty people were injured in the attack on the eve of the Conservative Party conference but the terrorists' main target, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, escaped relatively unscathed. Sir Anthony Berry MP, who died in the Brighton bombing, pictured in 1966 with wife Sarah Anne Clifford-Turner . Then and now: Patrick Magee, pictured left in the 1980s and right, in 2001, was given eight life sentences in 1986 but was released just 13 years later . At the time of the bombing, Ms Berry, now 57, was a 27-year-old meditation student who had sympathised with the IRA hunger strikers' pursuit for political status in the Maze prison. She was about to jet off to Africa when the harrowing news of the bomb filtered through. 'It was a massive shock and we had a long, long wait before we eventually got the news in the afternoon that they had found my dad's body and that my step-mother was injured,' she said. 'I didn't just lose my father in that bomb -- someone I had become really close to -- I lost a part of me and I felt very strongly that I was now part of the conflict in Northern Ireland.' Magee was given eight life sentences in 1986 but was released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in 1999 after serving just 13 years. Shattered: The top four floors of the Grand Hotel, Brighton after the bomb exploded on October 12, 1984 . Fellow IRA members Gerard McDonnell, Peter Sherry, Martina Anderson and Ella O'Dwyer were also sentenced to life for conspiracy to cause explosions. They were also released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. A year after Magee's release, Ms Berry, who had deliberately stayed away from the court proceedings and distanced herself from media coverage, met him at a friend's house in Dublin. She did not tell her siblings about meeting which marked the beginning of a 'miraculous' journey. Since that first meeting, they have met to share a platform on non-violence more than 100 times. She said: 'It was very much 'we' talking rather than 'I'. He was talking for the group - for the IRA, or for Sinn Fein - rather than himself. But, I was very curious about what was beneath that. 'I didn't go into the meeting wanting to argue with him or prove points. It was really to listen and understand. 'He was disarmed by my giving him empathy and there was a second part of the conversation where he had taken off his political hat and was speaking much more as a human being.' Ms Berry, who now runs the Building Bridges for Peace charity, decided within two days of her father's death to extract something positive from the tragedy. In the past 13 years, the reconciliation talks have taken her and Magee to places like Palestine, the Balkans, Rwanda and Colombia. Patrick Magee and Jo Berry now travel the world together to give talks on peace and reconciliation . Patrick Magee walks with Jo Berry through Brighton city centre in 2004 on the 20th anniversary of the bombing . The extensive damage from the bomb inside the Grand Hotel, Brighton, planted by IRA member Patrick Magee . Ms Berry believes her father would have approved of her actions. She said: 'I hope he would have understood and given me his support. I think he would have. I am not a politician but, in my own way I think he'd understand that I am trying to change things. 'I never thought I would be planning two events in Brighton on the 30th anniversary with Patrick Magee. The pair will be taking part in a panel discussion at The Old Market in Hove to mark the 30th anniversary of the explosion. Ms Berry said it was important Magee attended. Patrick Magee's wife Eileen (third from left) outside the Old Bailey in 1986 where he was on trial for murder . There was heavy security outside the Old Bailey for the trial of IRA members accused of the Brighton bombing . She said: 'For me, inviting Pat to be there on Sunday is to show a living example of reconciliation and the power of empathy. It is really important to have him there to demonstrate that. 'Yes, some people will be upset but, I think, that for peace sometimes you have to take these risks.' Magee has declined to give press interviews ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Brighton bombing. Ms Berry believes he has changed considerably. She added: 'When he planted the bomb he wasn't seeing human beings. It was a strategy and now he sees human beings and wonderful human beings. It has been about him getting his humanity back. That has changed him, definitely. 'He regards me as a friend. He knows that my dad was a wonderful human being and he knows that some of the qualities I have came from my father and that weighs heavily on him.' Patrick Magee, pictured with Jo Berry in 2004, have met on more than 100 occasions to talk about non-violence . How the Daily Mail reported the attack on October 13 . It is 30 years since the Brighton bomb ripped through The Grand Hotel killing five people and seriously injuring 34 others. As well as Sir Anthony Berry, Eric Taylor, 54, chairman of the Conservative party's north west area, Anne Wakeham, 45, wife of the government chief whip, Jeanne Shattock, 52, wife of the chairman of the party's western area, and Muriel McLean, 54, wife of the Chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, were killed. The intended target of the IRA terrorist attack was Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Tory Cabinet, who were staying at the hotel during the Conservative Party conference. But while Mrs Thatcher and her husband Denis narrowly escaped injury, others who were caught up in the explosion at 2.53am on October 12 1984 were not so fortunate. Former Tory minister Lord Tebbit, the then trade and industry secretary, was severely injured in the blast and his wife Margaret was left paralysed from the neck down and needing 24-hour care. 'I think about it every day in the sense that I look at my wife who was sentenced to life imprisonment in a wheelchair,' he said. Fiercely protective of his wife, Lord Tebbit, 83, says the anniversary is 'just another day' as he and Lady Tebbit live with the injuries they sustained in the attack. He said: 'There is nothing really to celebrate, or mark, it just goes on.' Age has brought its own problems exacerbating the injuries he and his wife suffered, he said. He said: 'There are only two alternatives. You either live with it or you die with it, and that's the way it is.' 'It just goes on': Lord Tebbit with his wife Lady Tebbit who was left paralysed after the attack . Lord Tebbit also says he has nothing but contempt for bomber Patrick Magee who was handed eight life sentences at the Old Bailey in 1986, with a recommendation he serve a minimum of 35 years. He was released in 1999 under the Good Friday Agreement - having served 13 years for the crime. Lord Tebbit said: 'Magee is just a low creature and an object of contempt, particularly as he now tries to make something of a living out of talking about it. 'He was no more than a monkey on an organ grinder's organ.' Magee will be in the city on Sunday taking part in a panel discussion following a screening of documentary Beyond Right & Wrong at The Old Market in Hove. The programme follows the story of Jo Berry, whose father Sir Anthony Berry was killed in the explosion, and her reconciliatory journey with Magee. The Grand will also be marking the anniversary with a minute's silence at noon on Sunday. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was staying at the hotel for the Conservative Party conference but escaped relatively unscathed . Staff at the hotel will gather around a plaque in the lobby which was unveiled by Lord Tebbit on the 25th anniversary of the bombing. The flag on the roof of the hotel will be flown at half mast for the whole day and the flags on the front of the building will be taken down as a mark of respect to all those who lost their lives and were injured during the bombing. General manager Andrew Mosley said: 'It is an opportunity to remind the staff and ourselves of what happened 30 years ago on that day. 'To reflect on what it must have been like for our colleagues at the time and to remember those who lost their lives, those who were injured, the community in Brighton that was so badly affected, and members of the emergency services who were called to the blast. 'The message we want to send above all else is that we have not forgotten what happened here 30 years ago.'

"A well-known beauty editor has been accused of staging a 'full on' tantrum at a Manolo Blahnik sample sale after spotting some of her fellow attendees trying to cut the line at the VIP event. According to a witness at the sale, which took place at the Warwick Hotel in Midtown, New York, yesterday, Women's Wear Daily beauty editor Julie Naughton 'freaked out that people who had just walked in were getting queued up before her' and began lashing out at guests. 'She was screaming: ""I hope these people don’t ever want to work in publishing"",' the source told Page Six. 'And then [she] started trash-talking... She was being such a terrible bully.' Scroll down for video . Freak out: A witness at the event told Page Six that Julie Naughton, pictured left alongside 50 Cent and Peter Bjorn at an event in June, began screaming at people who were in the queue ahead of her . Pricey pumps: Manolo Blahnik shoes usually sell for upwards of $1,000 a pair . The Page Six witness claims that Ms Naughton said of one attendee: 'She looks like she’s from Long Island and her Chanel bag is fake.' The one-day Manolo sample sale is renowned among fashion lovers as one of the hottest tickets in town thanks to its impressive discounts and wide variety of stock. Luxury high heels which usually retail for more than $1,000 a pair are available at the sale for a fraction of the price, with some shoes going for as little as $100. VIPs and fashion editors were invited to attend an early preview of the event, which began at 9am, two hours before the general public were given access. According to a spokesperson for WWD, Ms Naughton arrived promptly at the hotel at 6.30am in order to secure her place in the queue and was merely 'defending' her space when she noticed that some people were trying to cut in. 'It was a crowded sample sale, and there were several line crashers,' the spokesperson told Page Six. 'Words were exchanged, but she was standing her ground, as she arrived earlier. She was defending her, and everyone else’s, place in line.' Celebrity must-haves: Sex and the City star Sarah Jessica Parker (left) and actress Jennifer Aniston are both known to be fans of Manolo Blahnik's designs . 'The characterization of this exchange is inaccurate and unfair,' a spokesperson added to MailOnline. 'Julie was defending her place in line as latecomers tried to jump ahead of others who had been patiently waiting their turn. 'We know sample sales of this kind are intense and if a snarky comment or two was exchanged…well, this is fashion after all…' While notable, Ms Naughton's tantrum was not the only incident which is reported to have taken place at the event. According to reports, a luxury handbag, which had been on display at the event, was stolen. It was also claimed that staff refused to open the windows for fear that would-be thieves might use the opportunity to throw shoes out of the building and into the arms of a waiting accomplice.","According to Page Six, beauty editor Julie Naughton 'freaked out' and screamed at other attendees at the VIP event ."
"Oscar Pistorius will have to wait . another day to discover if he will be granted bail as the hearing for . the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp went into a fourth day. Pistorius has admitted shooting 29-year-old model . Miss Steenkamp, but claims he did so thinking she was a burglar or burglars, . who were in the bathroom. He said he opened fire in the dark because he . was too scared to turn a light on. Realising his mistake, he broke the door down with a cricket bat and carried her downstairs, he said. As the hearing got under way, Nike confirmed that it has suspended its contract with Pistorius. Scroll down for video . Charged: Pistorius is alleged to have murdered Reeva Steenkamp . In . a statement, the company said: 'We believe Oscar Pistorius should be . afforded due process and we will continue to monitor the situation . closely.' The lead detective in the investigation has been dropped from the case after it emerged he is due to appear in court himself. Detective . Hilton Botha, who has given evidence against the Paralympian during his . bail hearing this week, is facing seven counts of attempted murder and . is due to appear in court in May. He has been replaced on the case by  Lt. Gen. Vinesh Moonoo. Botha . and two other police officers are accused of firing shots while trying . to stop a minibus in an incident believed to have happened in October . 2011. 'Blade Runner' Pistorius returned to court for the third day of his high-profile bail hearing. Allegations: Hilton Botha is facing seven charges of attempted murder . In court, where Pistorius' father Henke and brother Carl were present again, prosecutor Gerrie Nel said they did not know about the charges faced by Botha yesterday. Police Brigadier Neville Malila told Sky News that the charges only came to light late yesterday afternoon. He said: 'We were only informed yesterday that attempted murders charges against Hilton Botha have been reinstated. 'The . member is innocent until proven guilty. The member was chosen by the . station to do the investigation due to the fact that he is a senior.' The seven counts of attempted murder, dating back to 2011, relate to seven people in a minibus which was stopped and shot at, he said. On Wednesday Botha acknowledged the prosecution had no evidence challenging Pistorius's claim that he killed his girlfriend accidentally, as well as admitting a number of police blunders in the investigation. He said there was 'no way' he believed the double-amputee Paralympian's version of events, adding: 'I believe he knew she was in the bathroom and he shot four shots through the door.' Medupe Simasiku, of the National Prosecution Agency, previously said prosecutors were unaware of the charges against Botha when they put him up in court to explain why Pistorius should not be given bail. The court was told a witness heard 'non-stop shouting' coming from his home before he shot his girlfriend dead. Tragedy: Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead last week . The witness overheard the 'row' which is said to have come from the property at the exclusive Silver Lakes Golf Estate between 2am and 3am on Valentine's Day, the prosecution said. Shortly afterwards, Miss Steenkamp lay bleeding to death in Pistorius's bathroom. She was hit by three bullets - one in the head, the hip and arm, Pretoria Magistrates' Court heard. One witness reported hearing a shot, followed 17 minutes later by more shots, Botha said. 'One of our witnesses heard a fight, two people talking loudly at each other... from two in the morning to three,' he said, adding that the witness was about 1,000ft away. The runner has said he shot through the door while on his stumps. But the court heard the bullets' trajectory was through the top of the door and Botha claims the bullets were fired down, suggesting Pistorius was wearing his prosthetic legs when the shots were discharged. The court also heard that two boxes of testosterone and needles were found in Pistorius's bedroom. Allegations: Testosterone was reportedly found at Pistorius' home . His lawyer Barry Roux countered prosecution claims that testosterone was found, saying it was actually a herbal remedy, called Testocompasutium co-enzyme. Details were also released yesterday of a row Pistorius had with a man over a girl at Kyalami racetrack where Pistorius allegedly threatened to 'f*** up' the rival. It was also claimed he was involved in another shooting at a restaurant in Johannesburg in January and asked the gun owner to take responsibility for the accident. In an affidavit, Pistorius said he and Miss Steenkamp were in love and he thought she was in bed in the early hours of last Thursday when he got up in the dark and blasted through the door. Cross-examining Mr Botha, Mr Roux said a post-mortem examination showed Miss Steenkamp's bladder was empty, which he said is consistent with her getting up at 3am to go to the toilet. Mr Roux asked repeatedly why the police did not make simple checks - over the lighting and whether Pistorius had other phones after police said two seized iPhones were not used to call police or paramedics. Laughing stock: Botha was ridiculed in court for suggesting that Pistorius could jump bail . The lawyer said Pistorius phoned the housing complex manager for help at 3.19am, then Netcare hospital a minute later. The police discarded anything that might have been consistent with a defence, said Mr Roux. Officers found the victim covered in towels and wearing white shorts and a black top. The prosecution believe Pistorius, who won two gold medals and a silver at London's 2012 Paralympic Games, is a flight risk and is opposing bail. Pistorius, who had below-the-knee amputations when he was 11 months old, has offshore accounts and a property in Italy, it was claimed. Outside the red-brick building the Women's League of the ruling African National Congress yesterday protested, waving placards saying 'No Bail for Pistorius' and 'Rot in jail'. The case has stunned sports fans worldwide. In custody: Pistorius is escorted at the Boschkop police holding cells last week . But it has been felt most acutely in South Africa, where Pistorius was seen as a hero who transcended racial divides that persist nearly 20 years after the end of apartheid. He carried South Africa's flag at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics, and American magazine Sports Illustrated named him as one of the most inspiring figures of the year. As well as Nike, the sprinter's endorsements and sponsorships included, telecoms firm BT, sunglasses maker Oakley and French designer Thierry Mugler and were thought to be worth as much as $2million (£1.3 million) a year. Nike and Mugler both said they have dropped Pistorius from advertising campaigns, and the Clarins cosmetics giant said it was recalling its A Man perfume range out of 'respect and compassion towards the families involved'. The prosecution said they were unaware of the charges against the detective when they put him on the stand in court to explain why Pistorius should not be given bail. Brig Malila said that police learned yesterday, the same day that Botha appeared in court to oppose the bail application, that the charges against Botha and the two others had been reinstated by the Director of Public Prosecutions. They were initially dropped following the shooting incident. He said police were waiting for details from the Botha case file from the prosecutor. Medupe Simasiku, the spokesman for the prosecutors charging Pistorius with premeditated murder, could not say how the charges against Botha would affect their case against Pistorius. 'The (Pistorius) prosecutors were not aware of those charges (against Botha),' said Mr Simasiku, of the National Prosecution Agency. 'We are calling up the information so we can get the details of the case. From there we can take action and see if we remove him from the investigation or if he stays.'

"A right-wing group running a series of anti-Islamic ads in New York City's subway system is pulling a poster that shows captive journalist James Foley with the masked militant who decapitated him. The ads were bankrolled by the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI) led by blogger Pamela Geller. They are being yanked after criticism from the slain journalist's grieving parents. Geller's attorney, David Yerushalmi, said the Foley family were notified that the ads depicting Foley moments before he is beheaded by a masked ISIS militant dubbed Jihadi John.were being pulled. Incendiary: The American Freedom Defense Initiative had been planning to put up this anti-Muslim ad featuring an image of James Foley in New York City and San Francisco subways . Cease and desist: The group was forced to alter the ad after getting a letter from the Foley family expressing their opposition to the use of a frame from the beheading video . Yerushalmi added that he wrote their lawyer that 'Geller understands and feels intimately the pain' they are suffering. The attorney told the New York Post that other anti-Islamic ads, slated to appear in New York and San Francisco, will go forward this week. The original ad featured an image showing the alleged killer, described in the media as an aspiring rapper, in a recording studio accompanied by the caption: 'Executioner who beheaded reporter before he became Jihadist.' On the right-hand side of the poster there was a still from the infamous beheading video captioned: 'Executioner who beheaded reporter after becoming devout.' Above the photos a headline blared: 'Yesterday's moderate is today's headline.' A tagline printed in red at the bottom of the page read: 'It’s not Islamophobia, it's Islamorealism.' On her website, Pamela Geller shared an altered version of the ad with all references to the Foley beheading removed, along with his photo. The AFDI instead used another image of the alleged executioner holding someone else's pixilated severed head. Grieving parents: A lawyer representing Diane and John Foley sent a letter to the anti-Islam group informing them that the message expressed by the ad goes against everything their son stood for . The cease and desist letter informed the AFDI that running the ad will cause the Foleys 'profound distress' A lengthy blog post about the anti-Islamic advert included the letter sent to Geller by attorney Patrick Rowan from the firm McGuire Woods LLP representing Diane and John Foley. In his letter, the lawyer asked on behalf of James Foley's family to withdraw the ad and stop using it. 'Having lived in and reported from communities in which nearly everyone as of Muslim faith, he had great respect for the religion and those who practiced it. 'The advertisement you are preparing to run seems to convey the message that ordinary practitioners of Islam are a dangerous threat. 'This message is entirely inconsistent with Mr Foley's reporting and his beliefs.' Mr Rowan concluded his missive by warning the organization that using James Foley's image to draw funding and attention to the AFDI will cause his family 'profound distress.’ Firebrand: Right-wing blogger Pamela Geller is one of the founders of the controversial group behind the ads . Pamela Geller responded to the cease-and-desist letter by explaining that the aim of the group’s $100,000 campaign is to inform the public, not to cause harm. ‘The common thread that runs through the jihad in Syria, Iraq, Gaza, Nigeria, China, Thailand, Israel, Chechyna, Moscow, London, Madrid, Burma and ….. Oklahoma is a devout adherence to Islam,’ read the blog post. ‘So many Muslims now flocking to the Middle East were previously “moderate.” It is when they become devout that they engage in a bloody and vicious holy war. ‘Clearly, it’s not all Muslims, but there is a problem in Islam and we are prohibited from talking about it. Which is why our ad campaign is so essential.’ Ms Geller further said that the Foley ad was about stopping the next beheading by exposing the dangerous ideology of Jihad. Writing on the wall: In 2012, Geller's group put up ads in the New York Subway saying calling on the public to support Israel in the battle against Jihad . Last week, a coalition of politicians and religious leaders held a press conference in front of City Hall denouncing the anti-Muslim adverts, CBS New York reported. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams went so far as to compare the incendiary messages to yelling 'fire' in a crowded room. The American Freedom Defense Initiative has put up similarly controversial ads in subway stations in the past. In 2012, the group released a poster in support of Israel calling those engaged in Jihad 'savages.' The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said it had signed off on the latest batch of ads because under a federal court ruling, banning controversial viewpoints from being expressed in a public forum amounts to a violation of the the First Amendment to the US Constitution, .","The ads were bankrolled by right-wing blogger Pamela Geller's group American Freedom Defense Initiative .

"An Oregon dad of disabled children creates larger than life Halloween costumes for his children and with help from DreamWorks and generous donors, other disabled children can shine too. Whether he's making a medieval knight or a dragon, Ryan Weimer's unconditional love for his sons Keaton, 9, and Bryce, 2, has lead him to create sensational costumes for his children every year. Sadly Ryan and his wife Lana Weimer, who live in Keizer, lost two other children to the rare form of muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, the same disease plaguing Keaton and Bryce. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fire breather: Ryan Weimer started a Kickstarter to create a dragon costume for his son and after raising four times the amount he expected to he is starting a non-profit costume organization for disabled children . Movie character: Ryan's Weimer's son Keaton wanted to be Toothless from the film How to Train Your Dragon . Tragic: Sadly Ryan and his wife Lana lost two other children to the rare form of muscular dystrophy. Their daughter Addison (pictured) just days before her third birthday; and a third son, Eston, died at birth . Their daughter Addison just days before her third birthday; and a third son, Eston, died at birth. Ryan has now decided to create a non-profit organization called Magic Wheelchair to design costumes for children with special needs all over the world after quadrupling his fundraising goal on Kickstarter. He was also inspired after touring the DreamWorks facility that created the How to Train Your Dragon character that inspired his son's costume. Ryan had an original Kickstarter goal of $1,500 but when he reached the September 30 mark he raised $6,454 for a costume that later became his cause. This year Keaton will be Toothless, a character from the How to Train Your Dragon movies. When looking to design the costume, Ryan Weimer found the Stan Winston School of Character Arts website which shows web visitors how to build their favorite characters. Strong: Ryan Weimer makes his sons feel powerful and strong in costumes like this knight in shining armor . All aboard: In the past his son Keaton has wowed other kids when he dressed as a pirate on Halloween . Family affair: Keaton (left) Ryan (center) and Bryce (right) prep for a Halloween celebration . Their studio is responsible for the characters in Jurassic park and The Terminator. When the arts school caught wind of his inspiring idea for a costume following media coverage of his story, they invited him to tour the studio and DreamWorks Animation and Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment paid for a weeklong vacation in Los Angeles. 'That was absolutely once-in-a-lifetime visit,' Ryan Weimer said of the family's recent trip, which included tours of DreamWorks and classes at the Stan Winston School. 'It was truly amazing for all of us.' Ryan's costume making for his children began with a simple idea that turned into a huge creative project. 'It's just like the same thing anybody would do for their kids: dress them up for Halloween,' Ryan Weimer told TODAY.com. Feeling strong: Keaton loves the costumes his father makes him and will shine as Toothless the dragon on Halloween thanks to generous donors on his dad's Kickstarter . Animal instinct: Ryan Weimer has the creative urge to make costumes like this elephant for his disabled kids . 'For me, it's just what we do, but for other people, it's this really amazing thing,' he added. Ryan who describes himself as being a 'nerdy nurse with an imagination' first started the creative endeavor in 2008 when he created a wooden pirate ship for his son Keaton to wear. In 2009 Keaton was a dinosaur, in 2011 he was a Power Ranger, and in 2012 he was a Pokémon character. 'Every year, I ask my son what he wants to be,' Ryan Weimer told Today, . 'Immediately, I'm like, Holy crap. How am I going to make that?' Ryan Weimer said all donations beyond the $4,500 mark will be the basis for a new non-profit organization called Magic Wheelchair. 'I want people to look at my kids, not because they're different, but because they're amazing,' he said. 'And whatever I can do to try to create those opportunities [for other children] is what I want to do. And I'd love for other kids to be able to have that same experience. ... It's just an awesome opportunity for [kids] to be flying around on the dragon of their dreams.'","Ryan Weimer's unconditional love for his disabled sons Keaton, 9, and Bryce, 2, has lead him to create sensational costumes for them .

"A young Chinese worker struck down with leukaemia while working in a factory that makes Apple’s iPhones has died – days after his mother pleaded in The Mail on Sunday for Apple chief executive Tim Cook to help save her son’s life. Yi Long is at least the sixth worker to die of leukaemia after falling ill at the factory complex in Shenzhen, southern China, in a cluster of cases families believe may be triggered by the chemicals handled by workers. Yi, whose case was highlighted in a Mail on Sunday investigation, fell into a coma five days ago and was taken by his family from a hospital near the factory after doctors declared there was no hope. Yi Long, 25, (right) has become the sixth person to die of leukaemia after working at at an iPhone factory in China. His mother, Cheng Fuying, (left) appealed to Apple CEO Tim Cook days ago . He died in his family’s village home in rural Hunan province on Friday night and was buried yesterday on what would have been his 26th birthday. His distraught parents said they had been refused financial help by the factory, run by Apple contractor Foxconn, to pay for his cancer treatment and were unable to afford a bone marrow transplant. Apple said  that a four-month investigation into 22 final assembly facilities found ‘no evidence of worker health and safety being put at risk’ The Mail on Sunday revealed a fortnight ago how at least 13 workers in their late teens and 20s at the massive Foxconn complex employing 230,000 people had contracted leukaemia since 2010. Five had already died. Foxconn factories make electronic goods for a number of big international brands, including Apple. Sections of its operation are dedicated to iPhones and an Apple source said last week the Guanlan plant where Yi and four of the other five fatal leukaemia cases worked was a dedicated iPhone factory. Families and a labour rights group supporting them believe chemicals used in the production process may have caused the leukaemia. But Taiwan-based Foxconn insists blood cancer rates among workers are lower than the national average. Yi was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2011, 20 months after he started work at Foxconn. His mother Cheng Fuying protested outside Foxconn with the families of other leukaemia victims in 2012, pleading for help with medical bills, but said they were denied a meeting with factory managers and threatened with arrest unless they left. After her son’s funeral yesterday, she said: ‘I want justice for my son.’ A fortnight ago, she issued an appeal through the MoS to Apple CEO Tim Cook, saying: ‘If you have a conscience, Apple should at least make sure my son’s disease is treated.’ An Apple spokesman said yesterday that a four-month investigation into 22 final assembly facilities found ‘no evidence of worker health and safety being put at risk’. He added: ‘We care about every worker in our world-wide supply chain and work tirelessly to ensure their right to a safe and healthy work space. We were saddened to hear of the Yi family’s loss and wish to express our deepest condolences.’ In an earlier statement, Foxconn said the incidence of leukaemia among its employees across China was ‘significantly lower than the reported national annual rate’.","Yi Long, 25, fell ill with leukaemia while working at Apple iPhone factory .

"The controversial issue of same sex marriage could be heading for the Supreme Court, just a month after the body declined to rule on it. A federal appeals court on Thursday halted a run of rulings supporting same-sex marriage by the U.S. courts that are the last line for appeals just below the Supreme Court. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel instead upheld laws against the practice in four states — Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee. Halt of momentum? The rulling ran counter to a rapid string of victories for the gay rights movement. Pictured: Sean Lewrence, of Philadelphia, holds up a flag during a gay marriage rally, in Philadelphia last year . The ruling followed more than 20 court victories for supporters of same-sex marriage since the Supreme Court struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act last year. Lawyers for gay plaintiffs say they will ask the Supreme Court to hear their arguments, and the split created Thursday among the federal appeals courts makes it more likely they will agree to this time. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had explained in September that the lack of a split in the appeals courts made Supreme Court review of the issue unnecessary. But she said 'there will be some urgency' if the 6th Circuit allowed same-sex marriage bans to stand. One month ago Thursday, the Supreme Court turned away appeals from five states seeking to uphold their same-sex marriage bans. That action had the effect of further expanding gay marriage. 'Ecstatic': Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, applauded the ruling and said the other side was 'counting their chickens before they're hatched' (file picture) The 6th Circuit panel, in its 2-1 ruling, said changing the definition of marriage should be done through the political process, not by judges and lawyers. 'Surely the people should receive some deference in deciding when the time is ripe to move from one picture of marriage to another,' wrote Circuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton, writing for himself and a fellow George W. Bush appointee. The dissenting judge suggested that Sutton and Judge Deborah Cook might have wanted to push the issue on to the high court. 'Because the correct result is so obvious, one is tempted to speculate that the majority has purposefully taken the contrary position to create the circuit split,' Judge Martha Craig Daugherty wrote. The Clinton appointee added that the Supreme Court could put an ""end to the uncertainty of status and the interstate chaos that the current discrepancy in state laws threaten."" The ruling ran counter to a remarkably rapid string of victories for the gay rights movement over the past few months that have now made same-sex marriage legal in at least 30 states. Four other U.S. appeals courts in other regions of the country ruled in recent months that states cannot ban gay matrimony. 'This anomalous ruling won't stand the test of time or appeal,' said Evan Wolfson, president of the pro-gay marriage group Freedom to Marry, in a statement about the 6th Circuit ruling. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine's office, which argued in support of the voter-passed 2004 Ohio ban on gay marriage, said it was 'pleased the court agreed with our arguments that important issues such as these should be determined through the democratic process.' Brian Brown, president of the National Organisation for Marriage, said he was 'ecstatic' about the ruling. 'The other side was counting their chickens before they're hatched.' The Supreme Court would have to decide by mid-January whether to hear the case in time for a decision in June. Otherwise, the case would be pushed back to the following term and probably not decided until June 2016.","6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upholds laws in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, halting run of momentum for gay marriage movement .

"One extraordinarily lucky Massachusetts man took home $780,000 after winning the lottery twice in the same drawing. Kenneth J.

Strokes, of Norwood, Mass., had his name pulled twice in the state's Lucky for Life lottery . ABC 7 reports that shortly after lotto officials called to tell him he had a winning ticket, he remembered that his family had bought him another lottery ticket. When he found it, the second ticket had the same numbers as the winning one, which used his family's birthdays. 'For a game like this, where there's so many possible winning combinations..people rarely buy the same ticket with the same numbers...they have to be really confident that those numbers will come in,' said lottery spokesperson Christian Teja in an interview with The Boston Globe. Teja said Stokes was 'excited as most people are when they win a prize of this magnitude.' Strokes asked to be given the total lump sum of each winning, which comes to $39,000 per ticket. He says he'll use the money to cover his son's college education, pay off his daughter's car, then take his family on vacation.","Kenneth J.

"They say those who are bored of London are bored of life. But the latest craze to sweep the capital proves that even the most obscure - and gruesome - tastes are catered for. Taxidermy, or stuffing and posing dead animals, has become an unlikely favourite of the capital's trendiest residents. But you won't find retro stag's heads or large bears in the apartments of Dalston and Hoxton. Instead, taxidermy 2.0 is all about rodents. Cutesy: Taxidermy 2.0 involves posing mice and other rodents in sugary tableaux . Almost human: Most modern taxidermists also choose to dress their subjects in doll's clothes . Classes which teach you how to gut, clean, stuff and pose a mouse into a variety of ‘cute’ poses such as playing the trumpet, or dancing, have proved a sell-out success, with plans to roll them out across the rest of the UK already afoot. The brainchild of Muswell Hill resident, Suzette Field, 35, and New York tattoo artist Sue Jeiven, the macabre craft classes are based on traditional taxidermy techniques dating back to the Victorian period. Though originally envisioned as one-off pop up workshops, their popularity soon saw Suzette enlist the help of Margot Magpie, a member of the UK Guild of Taxidermists, to launch a regular class at alternative venue The Last Tuesday Society. Speaking to MailOnline, Suzette explained: 'At first I wasn't sure if there would be the demand but our first two classes sold out in just 24 hours.' The classes takes students through mouse taxidermy, from corpse to cute ornament in just four hours. Students can choose to pose their mount in a naturalistic setting but are also introduced to the art of anthropomorphism - the attribution of human characteristics to animals, plants or non-living things. DIY: Suzette also sells mouse-stuffing kits over the internet - ideal for budding taxidermists outside London . Self-help: Suzette also offers a manual to guide newcomers to taxidermy through the process . The anthropomorphism trend, which was last popular with the upper classes during the Victorian era, sees the taxidermist pose and often dress the animal in imagined scenes such as in a school room, playing in a band, or having a picnic. For those who find mice a little tame, extended classes, which cost £200 each, teach students how to tackle more complex animals such as rabbits in day-long courses. There are also DIY kits available for those who can't get to London, with prices starting at £25. Suzette adds: 'We had people saying they would come over from France to take the . classes, even interest from America, and that's what prompted me to make . it more transferable with the kits.' Each kit contains everything a budding taxidermist needs, from surgical gloves, long need nosed pliers, galvanised wire to Liquacure Tanning Solution and Borax (a powered mineral). Though the idea of gutting a mouse in your own living room may sound unappealing, over 500 of the kits have been purchased in just three weeks. In response to those who question the ethics of taxidermy, Suzette says: 'All the rodents we use were bred as reptile food. 'No animals die specifically for taxidermy and we take great care to only source the rodents from breeders who adhere to strict ethical guidelines.'","Taxidermy, or preserving dead animals, growing in popularity .

"Fishermen can be very protective over their favourite spot  as these brown bears showed when they got into a fight over salmon.

"On a flipchart inside the dressing room at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami, the FA made sure that England’s players were all on message. ‘We are ready for Italy!!!!!’ was scrawled across it in capital letters. They really believe they are. These are some of the FA’s secrets, one of the rituals Roy Hodgson and various FA officials agree on before the players leave the dressing room to speak with the media. On the left hand side of the chart, Leighton Baines, Jordan Henderson, Joe Hart and Phil Jagielka had been nominated to stop and speak after England’s laboured 0-0 draw with Honduras. On message: The briefing to players after England's draw with Honduras in Miami . Secrets revealed: The flip chart in the England dressing room gives instructions to the players . Before they left the dressing room area they were addressed by FA officials and reminded about the positive messages they were expected to hammer home as part of Team England’s propaganda. Hodgson had already spoken to the players about their performance against Honduras and then approved the various messages written in big capital letters. Most were written by the communications team, although England psychologist Dr Steve Peters presumably plays a part in the positivity. The chart was left by the entrance to England’s dressing room as the kit men were loading up vans to take to Miami’s international airport before the team flew overnight to Rio de Janeiro. Despite all the pressures of the World Cup and England’s opening group game against Italy on Saturday in Manaus, Hodgson is across everything. Fully covered: Roy Hodgson is aware of Argentina posing with a Fawklands banner . The heat is on: Hodgson speaks to the Media after landing in Rio de Janeiro . Briefed by the FA communications team that Argentina’s players had posed with a politically charged and powerful banner claiming the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands before their friendly with Slovenia, Hodgson reacted. He knows his history and the political implications. ‘Don’t answer questions on Falklands’, was written on the board, followed by three exclamation marks. Captain Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Rickie Lambert were the only three players in England’s squad who were born before the Falklands War in 1982 but Hodgson knows his history. There were other messages on the flipchart and most of them related to the sterile draw that had just been played. Hodgson was also pleased that the team travelled to Brazil without any further injuries as they wait for more news on the condition of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Controversial: Argentina's footballers pose for photographers holding a banner reading 'The Malvinas / Falkland Islands are Argentine' before a friendly against Slovenia . Touching down: Frank Lampard is one of few people in the England squad who was alive during the Falklands war . The information, which is written after every game for England’s players, also carried some interesting admissions. Included in the debrief was the message that the England team ‘could have been better with their use of the ball’. The FA were right. England had 67 per cent possession but had only three shots on target in their final warm-up game. Henderson had 102 touches of the ball, more than any other England player. The flipchart recorded that England had the ‘best chances’ and that Hodgson was ‘delighted with the workout’. This is all designed to be positive as England’s players prepare for the World Cup finals. They arrived in Rio on Sunday morning after a difficult couple of draws against Ecuador and Honduras. Talking things through: Steven Gerrard and Hodgson talk about the game as they leave the pitch . Still, the FA were pleased with the way they reacted against a combative Honduras side, although there is an admission that they were surprised by their approach to a friendly just days before the start of the tournament. Honduras, ranked 33rd in the world by FIFA, had five players booked and were down to 10 men when right-back Brayan Beckeles was dismissed in the 65th minute. The players were also instructed to tell the media that ‘we may face this in Brazil’, although the information did not speculate on whether group opponents Italy, Uruguay or Costa Rica will adopt similar, barbaric tactics. It seems unlikely. The area of discipline was also brought up and the players were reminded that they showed a ‘cool temperament’ in the conditions, particularly after a 45-minute suspension during an electrical storm. Good work out: England were given a tough test by Honduras in Miami . Getting use to the conditions: England players train ahead of the game in Miami . They also looked ahead to the World Cup when the players chosen for media duty were addressed before they walked out of the England dressing room. Despite three mediocre warm-up games, with victory over Peru and draws with Ecuador and Honduras, the players insist they are fully prepared. They were also ordered not talk about the individuals in Cesare Prandelli’s team during interviews with the media. Keeper Gianluigi Buffon, plus Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci, Andrea Pirlo, Daniele de Rossi, Marco Verratti and Mario Balotelli are the stars in the Italian squad. Italy  have won the World Cup four times and, despite seven games without a win in the build-up, they will be a massive threat to England in Manaus on Saturday.

Watching on: Hodgson and Sir Trevor Brooking look around the England team hotel in Rio . Staying on message, Henderson carried out Hodgson’s instructions when he was asked who would be given the job of marking Pirlo. Henderson said: ‘It’s up to the manager to decide. Obviously this week we’ll be looking at them on a more tactical level. That’s up to the manager to decide what tactics he personally wants.’ The next point on the England flipchart was to remind the players that their flight to the Urca military base in Rio meant that it was the start of the ‘real thing’. The final message to the players was not to mention the ‘Les Malvinas son Argentinas’ banner held up by the country’s players before their 2-0 victory over Slovenia in front of a 52,000 crowd on Saturday.

"Her fiery orange stare is certainly fearsome enough to scare off burglars. The problem is, it’s also frightening off potential owners. Bagheera – named after the amber-eyed panther in the Jungle Book – has been unable to find a home since she arrived at a rescue centre in Italy as a six-month-old puppy. People were put off by her striking eyes, which are the result of a rare gene. Scroll down for video . The black collie cross first went to a rescue centre in Italy as a six-month old puppy, but no-one adopted her - with many put off by her strange orange eyes, which are incredibly rare in a dog . Nervous: A combination of difficult behaviour and lack of training is putting Brits off adopting Bagheera . So Teckels Animal Sanctuaries in Gloucester has brought the black Collie-Belgian Shepherd cross, now eight, over to England in the hope of finding her her very first home. Alice Breaks, a senior kennel technician at Teckels, said: 'I love her, she is lovely looking and her eyes are this amazing orange colour. 'I have never come across a dog with eyes like hers before. Bagheera's orange eyes, which are incredibly rare in a dog, is thought to put prospective owners off . Bagheera the collie cross is named after the panther from Disney's The Jungle Book, pictured left . 'Bagheera is quite nervous and we are struggling to find her a home. She needs to go to a quiet, adult-only home which is ideally in a rural setting. The default eye colour for a dog is brown. Amber eyes in dogs usually occur when the uemelanin (natural dark pigment in an organism) produced is diluted by recessive genes. All liver, blue and isabella dogs have amber eyes. Very occasionally, dogs with a black pigment also have amber eyes. 'She has been in a rescue home since the age of six-months but she is now becoming more friendly. 'She will always have certain issues but I have taught her some English and she will sit and give her a paw when she feels comfortable. 'We think she is a Collie crossed with a Belgian Shepherd. Hopefully someone with experience will come forward and give her a home.' Phillip Robinson, Battersea Dogs & Cats Home's veterinary surgeon, said: 'Eye colour is genetically linked to the parent animals and it is exceptionally rare to see this type of pigmentation in dogs of this breed. 'Hopefully her eye-catching feature will help Bagheera find a new family and settle down into a permanent home.'

"Sam Robson grew up in Sydney supporting Australia but he became the latest new face to provide encouragement for England’s fresh start by repeating Gary Ballance’s feat at Lord’s of scoring a century in his second Test. There is no question that Robson is fully entitled to appear for his mother’s country after making his life in England and turning his back on overtures from Australia when it became clear last year that he would play at the highest level. Yet nationality is a perennially thorny issue in cricket and it will not go unnoticed that the two young,  talented batsmen who put England in a strong position in this second and final Test both played for other countries at Under-19 level. Only when cloud cover returned to Headingley after tea and suddenly the ball nibbled around did Sri Lanka puncture England’s day of dominance, taking four cheap wickets in the final session to keep themselves in the hunt for the second Test. VIDEO Scroll down for Sam Robson hit his first century in second Test for England . Milestone: Sam Robson hit his first Test century on his second appearance for England . Composed: Robson looked assured at the crease and his 127 helped England into a position of preponderance . Much has . been made of the need for ‘Englishness’ in the national team in this new . era, yet Robson learned his trade in the shadow of the Sydney Cricket . Ground while Ballance, his partner in a stand of 142 here, is from . Zimbabwe. Geoff . Miller, who resigned as national selector last winter, used to say he . would always look into the eyes of any dual-nationality recruit to make . sure they had the passion, desire and correct motivation to play for . England. Well, . if Miller had looked into Robson’s eyes he would have seen a . fiercely determined, old-fashioned opening batsman who is likely to be a . prolific, if not always entertaining, member of this England team for . years to come. To . be at Headingley was to almost step back in time to the days when Geoff . Boycott would have the locals in thrall to his accumulative methods and . a scoring rate of just under three runs an over would be positively . giddy. Robson . is a friend and contemporary of David Warner but he could hardly be . more different, both as a man and a batsman. His steady, unspectacular . style and under-stated manner are almost an antidote to the excesses of . the modern game. His . efforts were certainly appreciated by this knowledgeable Yorkshire . crowd as Robson’s 127 in an England reply of 320 for six to . Sri Lanka’s 257, a lead of 63 after two days, was greeted with rich, . appreciative applause. At the forefront of those who rose to  Robson . were his parents. Late drama: Shaminda Eranga took Ian Bell's wicket late on as England's middle order dropped like flies . Late drama: Angelo Mathews celebrates as Joe Root is dismissed to leave England wobbling . Born in New South Wales to an Australian father and an English mother from Nottinghamshire, the 24-year-old plays for Middlesex. Australia batsman Chris Rogers took Robson ‘for a few pints’ in a bid to persuade him to play for the Aussies rather than England. Played at Under-19 level for Australia before becoming eligible to play for England in 2013. In 2009, he hit a maiden first-class century in his debut season against Essex at Lord’s. In 2012, he became the first batsman in history to score a first-class hundred in England in the month of March with a ton against Durham MCC University. Was the leading run-scorer in the 2013 County Championship (933 runs at an average of 62.06). Made his England Test debut against Sri Lanka on June 12, scoring 1 and 19. His . dad ‘Jungle’ Jim coaches at the SCG and flew from Sydney ahead of the . first Test to watch his son’s first steps as a ‘genuine’ Englishman and . watch on intently at Headingley. How . England needed the graft and grind of Robson, who moved to . London six years ago and made his name with Middlesex before scoring . five centuries last winter for the England Lions to confirm his . allegiance. He . had seen his captain Alastair Cook, desperately in need of a hundred . with pressure growing on his captaincy, add just three runs to his . overnight 14 before falling to his old failing — a full delivery just . outside off-stump. England . could not afford any more cheap wickets if they were to build a score . that would define this decisive Investec Test and they had the perfect . pair in Robson and Ballance to steady the ship and chip away at Sri . Lanka. Paul . Downton, the England managing director, wants the team to be positive . at all times but, with the Headingley conditions still giving assistance . to the Sri Lankan attack, there was a need for good old-fashioned . digging in. That is Robson’s game and here he shrugged off the . uncertainty of his nervy debut last week to unfurl his favoured cover . drives and that strength off his hip that has raised, perhaps . prematurely, comparisons with Mike Atherton. Pulling rank: Ian Bell hit 64 after Sri Lanka wilted in the Yorkshire heat . In focus: Gary Ballance continued where he left off at Lord's, scoring 74 on his home ground . Robson . is hardly a product of the Twenty20 generation but he did show that he . could hit high and straight, notably when he lofted Rangana Herath for a . straight six and held his perfectly straight bat in a textbook pose. By . that time Robson had passed three figures and had also lost Ballance, . who was not as fluent as in his Lord’s century but again showed enough . quality to fully justify the faith of a new selection panel who are yet . to put a foot wrong. Ballance . was actually given out lbw on 31 to Herath but what appeared an . optimistic review against Billy Bowden’s decision was proved justified . when technology suggested the ball would miss the adopted Yorkshireman’s . leg stump. He . also could have been run out or caught at short leg before Angelo . Mathews, doing the job his frontline seamers struggled to accomplish, . put the ball in the right place to take the edge of Ballance’s bat and . dismiss him for 74. Caught wanting: Alastair Cook can only watch as Kumar Sangakkara competes his dismissal off the  bowling of Dhammika Prasad . At sixes and sevens: Since scoring a century against New Zealand at Headingley last summer, Cook has scored 585 runs in 23 innings at an average of 25.4 . When . Robson followed him, bowled through the gate by Nuwan Pradeep, the . stage was set for Ian Bell in his 100th Test and he did not disappoint . initially as he raced along to 64 to take England beyond Sri Lanka’s . below-par total. He . looked certain to celebrate his landmark in the grand manner until . Shaminda Eranga strangled him down the leg side. When Joe Root quickly . followed a window of opportunity had suddenly opened for Sri Lanka. Moeen .

"Mr Justice Moylan (pictured), sitting in the Family Division of the High Court in London, said his 'paramount consideration' was the girl's welfare . A couple have been given the go-ahead to adopt a three-year-old girl despite separating during the adoption process. The couple, who are in their 40s and were married for several years before separating, have been allowed to complete the adoption of the young girl after a court heard how she had developed a strong bond with them and viewed them both as her 'parents'. The youngster had been placed in the care of a local authority when she was born, Mr Justice Moylan heard during a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. Her father had died and she last had contact with her mother when she was five months old. She had been placed with foster carers and had then moved in with the couple who were aiming to adopt her. The couple had notified a local authority that they were going to separate shortly after making an adoption application. Since their separation last year, the couple have been living apart and the child has lived with the woman - her prospective adoptive mother. Mr Justice Moylan said he had considered ordering the woman to restart the process and make a fresh application to adopt the girl herself. But the judge said both the man and the woman wanted to adopt the girl jointly. He said he had decided that it was in the girl's best interests for them to be allowed to adopt - even though they were no longer together. He said he had heard evidence from the man and woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and from a social worker. He said it was clear that both the man and the woman were committed to the youngster, that she had developed a strong bond with them and viewed both as her 'parents' and that they had managed to maintain good relations between themselves. 'My paramount consideration is [the girl's] welfare throughout her life,' said Mr Justice Moylan. The couple, who are both in their 40s and were married for several years before splitting, have been allowed to adopt the young girl after the High Court in London heard how she already viewed them both as her 'parents' 'There are a number of factors which lead me to conclude that in order to secure and promote welfare throughout her life, it is necessary for her position within this family itself to be secured by an order which makes both her parents.' The judge said the man was in 'practical, psychological terms' the girl's 'father' and she was his 'daughter'. In the same way, the woman was the girl's 'mother'. He added: 'Although the parties are separated, they have continued to co-parent by agreement and, importantly, without significant disagreement or dispute. 'The factors in this case weigh decisively in favour of my making a joint adoption order in favour of the couple.'","Couple, who are in their 40s, were married for many years before separation .

"As many as 30 Britons may now have died fighting for terror groups in Syria, it was reported last night. Researchers believe 24 jihadists have been killed fighting with Islamic State and other groups but think the true figure could be higher. Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of Britons are believed to have fled to Syria and Iraq to join radical Islamic groups such as Islamic State (ISIS) and the Al Qaeda affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra. But despite the deaths and the mounting political pressure on extremist groups both at home and abroad, there remains little consensus on how prevent radicalisation of more British nationals. Scroll down for video . A video released by the Islamic State shows hundreds of people at a jihad training camp. It's believed there have been at least 24 British jihadists killed in the fighting in Syria . The training video, reportedly filmed near Ninawa, Iraq, also shows members practicing hand-to-hand combat . Shiraz Maher, of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, at King’s College London, told the Daily Telegraph death reports were rising but it was hard to verify exactly how many had died because of the difficulty of getting information from Syria. He said: ‘The increasing reports of deaths will not dissuade people from going, because they regard it as martyrdom and a victory. ‘It is the ultimate prize for these jihadists and those around them celebrate their death.’ Raffaello Pantucci, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told the paper future converts may even be inspired by the killings. 'If you are going out there to fight and are motivated by the idea of jihad then you are not going to be put off by the deaths - some might even be inspired by them.' Most recently, a teenager from Brighton, Ibrahim Kamara, 19, is believed to be among four radicalised Brits killed in an air strike in the Middle Eastern country last month. A Foreign Office spokesman said last night: ‘We are aware of reports of the deaths of British Nationals in Syria. ‘The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, where all UK consular services are suspended. ‘As we do not have any representation in Syria, it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British Nationals there are extremely limited.’ Ibrahim Kamara, also known as Khalil al-Britani, from Brighton, was reportedly killed in U.S. air strikes . Kamara, 19, ‘met the wrong people’ and was quickly radicalised, vowing never to return to Britain . Kamara, who called himself Khalil al-Britani, had recently completed a resit of his GCSEs at Varndean College in Brighton. But the football-loving teenager ‘met the wrong people’ and was quickly radicalised. He is said to have recently vowed to a fellow fighter he would never return to Britain. Following his death, his 35-year-old mother, Khadijah Kamara, said: ‘He called me in February. He said: “Mum, I’m in Syria”, and I hung up. Smoke rises following an airstrike by the US-led coalition in Kobani, Syria, where intense fighting between ISIS and Kurdish resistance forces has taken place in the past few weeks . The ruins of the neighbourhood Dakhaniyeh, southeast of the Syrian captial Damascus . Turkish soldiers defend their country's border as the battle for Kobane continues  hundreds of metres away . 'He rang again and I said: “Don’t ever call me.” The first we heard about his death was when my younger son got a Facebook message from one of the boys he went out there with. ‘He sent a photo of Ibrahim dead and the message read “Congratulations, your brother has become a martyr”. My son told him to delete the picture but he refused.’ Kamara was a member of Jabhat al-Nusra, an Al Qaeda affiliate which has fought with, and sometimes against, Islamic State. The group has also fought against the forces of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in the country’s civil war. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Reverend Justin Welby, has warned against fuelling more extremism through the use of violence . The group were part of a 500-strong contingent of radicalised Britons who are believed to have made their way to the Middle East. Although political pressure on the groups has escalated in recent months, there remains little consensus on how to prevent further radicalisation. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Reverend Justin Welby, has said the use of force to stop the extremists can be justified in some instances but warned it also  fuels radicalisation. Writing for Prospect Magazine, he said: 'Used only in the Levant (the eastern Mediterranean) and despite the involvement of five Islamic countries in the current US-led coalition, military force is inevitably seen as yet more “crusader” violence and increases support for what it seeks to subvert.' He went on to criticise the 2003 Iraq War, led by George Bush and Tony Blair, for creating new networks of international terror and said violence should only be used when absolutely necessary. 'It needs to be integrated as a temporary aspect into the global response, playing a part in preventing groups such as ISIS or Boko Haram from changing the facts on the ground so drastically that all help to terrorised populations becomes impossible.'","At least 24 British radicals believed to have so far died fighting in Syria .

"Cristiano Ronaldo was warned by his doctor that he risks threatening his career by playing on for Portugal at the World Cup. The Real Madrid superstar is struggling with a knee injury but is under pressure to lead his team into Sunday’s crucial clash with the USA after the 4-0 opening defeat to Germany.

"CLICK HERE to view our brilliant Match Zone service including Lee Keun-Ho's goal... Fabio Capello would have pictured Rob Green in Rustenburg as Igor Akinfeev treated the ball like a bar of soap to gift South Korea a goal remarkably similar to Clint Dempsey’s for the USA four years ago. For a second World Cup in succession the Italian’s plans for an opening game were undone by a goalkeeping clanger. This time it came in Cuiaba when substitute Lee Keun-Ho advanced without challenge and struck a shot that should have been gathered easily only for Akinfeev to horribly misuse his hands and allow the ball to topple over the line. The Italian, who turned 68 as this match switched from Tuesday to Wednesday in Britain, acted quickly and sent on veteran striker Alexander Kerzhakov, who rescued a point almost instantly by tapping in a rebound after a brilliant run and shot by fellow substitute Alan Dzagoev 16 minutes from time.

Daniel Sturridge posted a group shot of Roy Hodgson's men on the team bus in Manaus before Saturday night's showdown as the squad travelled to a local shopping centre. However many players soon left after being mobbed as fans attempted to get autographs and take snaps of the players.

I see you baby lol.' Meanwhile, Steven Gerrard posted a photograph on his Instagram account from the 'Manaus jungle' overlooking the Arena da Amazonia. And judging by the caption accompanying the picture, the 34-year-old is itching to kickstart England's bid to lift the Jules Rimet trophy for a second time as he wrote: 'A view of the stadium through the jungle. The wait is almost over.' The footballing showpiece in Brazil will be the third World Cup for the midfielder with the quarter-finals the furthest Gerrard has reached with his country back in 2006. The Three Lions midfielder is expected to start for Roy Hodgson's side against the experienced Azzurri in a midfield match-up against Italy duo Andrea Pirlo and Daniele de Rossi.

"Wayne Rooney has hit back at critic Paul Scholes after ending his eight-month England goal drought - insisting he is fit and hungry to play in Saturday’s final World Cup warm-up game against Honduras. Scholes claimed that Rooney is a fading force who faces being dropped for the World Cup. But Rooney has pointed out that his former Manchester United team-mate has been little more than a peripheral figure at the club recently - only returning to the coaching staff when Ryan Giggs was made caretaker boss in April. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney in super slo-mo action during England training . Angered: Wayne Rooney (centre) has hit back at criticism from Manchester United legend Paul Scholes . ‘He’s been a team-mate but he’s been away from the first team for a long time,’ said Rooney. ‘I’ve seen a lot of people saying he’s coached me and been around the team but he hasn’t. ‘I’m not really going to react. I’m not interested. He’s got his opinions so let’s leave it at that. To be honest I’m not really interested in what anyone else has got to say. ‘I’m interested in what Roy Hodgson and the coaching staff here and the people around me say. People have their opinions but I don’t agree with them.’ Doubt: Scholes (left) has questioned whether Rooney is still the force he used to be . Scholes’ comments opened a debate which was fuelled when Roy Hodgson decided to play Rooney on the left wing against Ecuador on Wednesday. Rooney, who missed the end of the Barclays Premier League season with a groin problem, is the only outfield player to start both of  England’s warm-up games. He scored their opener in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador in Miami, his first international goal since October. ‘I can play in different  positions,’ said Rooney. ‘I’ve proved I can play on the left over the years. The manager didn’t have to tell me what to do. I know how to play that role. I’ve played it many times and I’ve no problem doing that. He didn’t have to explain it to me. ‘It is down to the manager. It’s not about me, it’s about the team. If the manager wants to play me up top, in behind, left, right, I’m happy to do that. ‘I’m ready to play. I hope to play against Honduras. I’ve trained hard, I have no  injuries or any recurrence of the groin strain I had at the end of the season. ‘I always needed game time. I felt really good, especially in the heat. I’m sure the  manager will have a tough decision but I’m ready.’ Together: Scholes (left) and Rooney have been team-mate for both England and United . Opener: Wayne Rooney (right) scores England's first goal against Ecuador on Wednesday . Rooney and Daniel Sturridge may need to refine their partnership if they are to play in tandem, as they did in the 3-0 win against Peru on Saturday. But the Manchester United striker pointed out: ‘I think in every game we’ve played together, one of us has scored.’ His facts are slightly skewed. The strikers have scored five between them in seven appearances together. Sturridge, rested against Ecuador, has scored in his last two England games — against Denmark and Peru. Rooney said: ‘Daniel’s a fantastic player. He can score goals from anywhere, like he did at Wembley. ‘We have trained a lot together so hopefully we can take that form into the tournament.’ Wide boy: Rooney (left) played on the left of midfield against Ecuador . Dangerous duo: Daniel Sturridge and Rooney have scored five goals in seven appearances together . David Moyes yesterday added his voice to those calling for Rooney to start in the World Cup. The former United manager said: ‘He has to play. He has the ability to score, he has the mental strength to handle the games. In those games you look to your big players and Wayne will be a big player for England. ‘But there is an awful lot of pressure being lumped on him, which isn’t right. England haven’t done particularly well in a lot of competitions, so no one should be expecting great things from them. 'To be a stand-out and make a difference in World Cup games is very hard. For me, Wayne would definitely start. He has the experience of past tournaments.’ In charge: England boss Roy Hodgson must decide where is best to play Rooney against Italy . ‘I think he is in a better place than he was this time last year. ‘He is playing well and his form has been good and I do think he has already come out and said he wants to have a good World Cup - you have to trust him and go with that. ‘He will be determined to do well. He knows how important this is for him. Wayne will be desperate to show everyone what he can do. ‘In his mind, he is strong and he will be determined to go out and show how good he is, with a determination to do the job. But you have to remember that the opposition can make it difficult for players as well. ‘He will also need good service and good players around him. Wayne cannot make it happen all on his own.’ Backing: Former Manchester United boss David Moyes has called for Rooney to start at the World Cup .","Wayne Rooney claims he is 'not interested' in the criticism from Paul Scholes .

"Young men aged between 16 - 24 are the most likely to shave, wax and 'manscape' their body hair . Record numbers of the nation’s men are turning to manscaping, which involves shaving, plucking and even the ‘boyzilian’ – the male version of the painful Brazilian wax. The pressure is felt particularly by young men – aged 16-24 – with some six in ten saying they now routinely groom their body hair, according to research by retail analysts Mintel. However, older men are also falling into line with a trend that was apparently started by sportsmen and style icons such as David Beckham, Christiano Ronaldo, Tom Cruise and Jake Gyllenhaal. Mintel suggests the trend may have been triggered by elite athletes, such as professional cyclists or swimmers, who remove their body hair to improve their performance. In a study published today, Mintel said: ‘Whilst once it was the preserve of elite athletes, it seems that more men are plucking up the courage to achieve a hair-free body. ‘Half of all Brits admit there is more pressure nowadays for men to remove or groom body hair. Indeed, for today’s modern man, hair removal has extended past a simple shave of the face.’ It found that over the last 12 months, some 55 per cent of men say they have removed hair from their head, this is followed by the pubic region at 29 per cent. For generations, the idea of having a hairy chest and body was considered a sign of virility and masculinity. However, the Mintel study found that some 13 per cent remove their chest hair. Its survey also found that 12 per cent trim their underarms and back, six per cent their bottoms, five per cent the arms, four per cent the legs and two per cent their feet. Additionally, Mintel’s research highlights how Britain’s men are giving Cara Delevingne and her famous eyebrows a run for her money, with one in four shaping their eyebrows. Charlotte Libby, senior beauty analyst at Mintel, said: ‘It is becoming increasingly commonplace for men, particularly the under-30s, to remove hair from their body as behaviours once described as metrosexual are becoming increasingly mainstream. ‘Major sporting events such as the 2014 Commonwealth Games and the media attention given to the swimming team and their hair-free bodies in particular, drew focus to male body hair removal.’ Overall, one in five men claim they feel expected to remove hair from their torso, while around the same number say they feel the pressure to remove hair from their underarms and 13 per cent from their legs. She said: ‘It is younger men in particular who are feeling the pressure to achieve a hair free body, with some six in ten 16-24-year-old men agreeing they feel pressure to remove or groom body hair, compared to 22 per cent of over-65s. Men are increasingly shaving off much more than just their facial hair, the research showed . ‘And while 42 per cent of Brits believe it is fashionable for men to have beards, almost the same number say they feel pressure from others to keep their facial hair neat and tidy.’ The trend towards hair removal for men is following something that has become a normal part of the beauty routine for the nation’s women. The Mintel figures show 82 per cent of women remove hair from their legs, while a further 78 per cent shave under their arms and 57 per cent do so around their pubic region. Miss Libby said: ‘The shaving and hair removal market is benefiting from the social norm for body hair to be removed.’ However, she said some women are trying to mount a backlash through initiatives such as ‘Armpits 4 August’ and the ‘Hairy Legs Club’ which is advocating a return to a more natural look. Mintel said the new enthusiasm for getting rid of body hair is driving a market in razers, creams and potions worth £624million in 2014, which is up by 2.1 per cent on last year.","Record numbers of  men are grooming their body hair, new study shows .

"In just a few decades they have escaped total extinction after being saved by breeders. The Hucul horses are pictured frolicking in the meadows and forests near Odrzechowa in southeastern Poland. The Hucul is a small primitive breed of sturdy pony which were used as pack horses to carry heavy loads over treacherous paths in the Carpathian Mountains in Eastern Europe. In the 19th century, the Huculs were used by the Austro-Hungarian Army and in Czechoslovakia in World War Two. However, the numbers of ponies rapidly declined and by the 1970s there were only around 300 horses left. But breeding programmes were put in place and the horses are now thriving and it is thought there are now thousands living in Eastern Europe. The horses are often used now by tourists and keen equestrians for trekking into the mountains. Scroll down for video .

"A grandfather choked to death in his hospital bed on a meal he should never have been given to eat. Roddy MacDonald died after staff served him the wrong meal. The 84-year-old had Parkinson’s Disease, making it difficult for him to chew or swallow. All his meals needed to be mashed and soft to prevent him choking but he was given a plate of beef goulash. Grandfather Roddy MacDonald, 84, died after staff served him the wrong meal. Here he is pictured with his wife Margaret, who died in 2012 . Mr MacDonald's son Craig said his father was a 'great dad and a great granddad - my kids adored him'. He is pictured here with his grandchildren before his death . Mr MacDonald's daughter-in-law Elizabeth (left)  and son Craig (right) launched a compensation claim against the hospital trust and were awarded £20,000 . The pensioner, who had been due to go home from Glasgow’s Gartnavel Hospital after recovering from a urine infection, tried to eat the dinner and choked. A doctor reportedly broke some of his ribs trying to resuscitate him but Mr MacDonald, a war veteran, could not be saved. His death certificate gave the main cause of death as ‘choked on food’. Yesterday his family, who have just received £20,000 in compensation for his death in 2011, spoke out. His son, Craig MacDonald, said: ‘My dad was a proud man who served in the army during the war. He had many good years ahead of him and it's such a shame his life ended the way it did. ‘It would have been easier to take if he had died of a heart attack but to think he was killed by the neglect of the people who were supposed to be caring for him is hard to take.’ Mr MacDonald’s family printed out a laminated diet sheet with his food requirements on it to prevent any mistakes from happening. His Parkinson’s put him at severe risk of choking by weakening the muscles in his jaw and face, making it harder for him to chew and swallow. He was put on a ‘pre-mashed’ diet, meaning food should be soft, tender and moist with little chewing required. Relatives said they first complained to nurses when he was instead served ‘fork-mashable’ food, which needs more chewing than was safe. His daughter-in-law, healthcare assistant Elizabeth MacDonald, said: ‘We found out the diet sheet we had made for Roddy had been lost, along with his notes, and turned up in a drawer. ‘Feeding someone the right food should be one of the most basic things to get right in hospital. It should never ever have happened. Mr MacDonald suffered from Parkinson's Disease, which meant he had problems chewing and swallowing. He was put on a 'pre-mashed' diet but doctors mistakenly fed him goulash. Here, he is pictured with wife Margaret . Mr MacDonald with his granddaughter (right, and alone, left). He had been in hospital for three weeks when he died, surrounded by his wife, son and daughter-in-law . ‘When he was given the beef goulash, we don’t know how long he was choking for. ‘A doctor tried to resuscitate him and we later found out broke a few of his ribs. They put him on a breathing machine and he died the same day.’ The pensioner had been in hospital for three weeks when he died, surrounded by his wife, son and daughter-in-law. A report from an expert witness found, the family said, that he was also given the wrong dosage of a Parkinson’s drug. He lost 10 per cent of his body weight in hospital but was not referred to a dietitian. They also say he was given an adult pad, even though he was not incontinent, because staff would not take him to the toilet. Mr MacDonald’s death was reported to the Procurator Fiscal and his family launched a claim for compensation, which was settled for £20,000. A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, which runs Gartnavel, said: ‘This is a tragic case and our sympathies remain with the family. Craig McDonald said of his father: 'My dad was a proud man who served in the army during the war. He had many good years ahead of him and it's such a shame his life ended the way it did' ‘We accept that there were failings in the care of Mr MacDonald. These were highlighted during our own Significant Incident Review process and a range of lessons were learned and improvements put in place.’ Since the tragedy the health board has improved labelling of texture-modified meals on patient menus and help for people eating them. But his son Craig is demanding an apology from the health board. He said: ‘The way my father was being treated was horrendous. ‘Staff were given a diet sheet with instructions because of his Parkinson's but gave him goulash and he choked to death. ‘He was a great dad and brilliant granddad - my kids adored him - and they killed him. I will never forgive them for that.’","Grandfather Roddy MacDonald, 84, died after choking on hospital goulash .

"Simon Perfitt, 58, went from a £50,000 job to living on benefits after he started playing fixed odds betting terminals . A former gambling addict has revealed how he blew £200,000 in 10 years after becoming hooked on gambling machines. Simon Perfitt, 58, went from a £50,000 job to living on benefits after he started playing fixed odds betting terminals (FOBT) - blowing up to £3,000 per day. The businessman had led a lavish lifestyle back in 2001, enjoying well-paid jobs in e-commerce which allowed him to own a Porsche. He had also just moved in with a new girlfriend. But Mr Perfitt, from Dudley, West Midlands lost it all after becoming addicted to playing roulette on the controversial machines, dubbed the crack cocaine of gambling and which rake in £1.5 billion-a-year in profit for bookmakers. Surprisingly, he didn't start betting until he was 45, but 10 years later was a broken man both financially and emotionally. Simon said: 'These fixed odds betting terminals destroy you. I became addicted instantly after a friend who played the machines asked me to pop into a bookies one day and have a go. After that, all I thought about all day was gambling. 'I worked to go on these machines and could spend up to 12 hours a day in there. I used to get up early and go in to the bookies before I went to work, at lunchtime and would go straight into one after work. 'Within 10 years I had lost £200,000, a relationship and my home as well. 'My whole personality changed. I became very introverted, made excuses not to see family and friends.' Scroll down for video . 'Crack cocaine of gambling': Mr Perfitt said 'FOBTs are so dangerous. You can lose hundreds of pounds in a matter of minutes with a few spins' File picture . Mr Perfitt finally sought help after moving from Cambridge to live in Dudley in 2011 after getting in touch with the Gordon Moody Association, which helps gamblers break the habit. He said: 'They helped me with my cognitive behaviour, helping to try and sort out my distorted thought patterns. Going there probably saved my life and I haven't gambled for three years.' The machines, of which there are 33,000 in betting shops across the country, have been blamed for a rise in problem gambling and have also been linked to money laundering. They account for around half of bookmakers’ profits but betting shop managers have anonymously told the Mail of the toll they take on customers and staff. Regular players are ‘like zombies’, the managers said, giving examples of how customers could attack staff and vandalise shops when they lose money. A recent poll found that three in four voters wanted a ban on the machines. Mr Perfitt has now set up a charity called Rethink Gambling to raise awareness of the dangers of gambling and to campaign against the FOBT terminals. His charity, which launches in November, will campaign for a reduction in the maximum stake on the machines, currently set at £100 every 20 seconds. The charity is also behind UK National Gambling Addiction Awareness Week taking place between December 1 and 7. He said 'FOBTs are so dangerous. You can lose hundreds of pounds in a matter of minutes with a few spins. 'Bookies have taken advantage of a loophole in the tax system. Bookies have been able to argue that feeding money into a FOBT is like betting on a horse race since the 'event' you are gambling on is happening on a computer server elsewhere. 'This allows them to set a maximum stake of £100, as opposed to the £2 maximum on machines in arcades.'","Simon Perfitt, 58, had a home, sports car and girlfriend before addiction .

"A husband and wife have admitted cooking up a large batch of marijuana butter and supplying it to four corrections officers. Timothy Scherzer 48, and Alyssa Scherzer, 43, from Kent County, Michigan, claim they are both medical marijuana caregivers and that the officers are their patients. Longtime Kent County corrections officers Michael Frederick, Todd VanDoorne, Timothy Bernhardt and Brian Tennant were arrested in March after a late-night interrogation by police. Timothy Scherzer 48, and Alyssa Scherzer, 43, from Kent County, Michigan,have admitted supplying corrections officers with a large amount of marijuana butter . Post office employees had tipped-off Kent Area Narcotics Enforcement Team officers about a suspicious package being sent to an undisclosed address. Investigators said they do not believe any of the substance entered the jail or that any of the inmates were involved. Cannabis butter is made by cooking ground cannabis buds before straining out the plant matter and allowing the liquid to set. THC, the active ingredient in cannabis binds with the fat, to create a product that can be easily used in cooking or as a spread. Cannabis butter is made by cooking ground cannabis buds before straining out the plant matter and allowing the liquid to set . A search warrant affidavit in Kent County Circuit Court files reveals Timothy Scherzer told police he is a patient as well as a caregiver. He said his patients were Michael Frederick and Todd VanDoorne as well as Christine Tennant, the wife of Deputy Brian Tennant. Alyssa Scherzer said she was the caregiver of Timothy Bernhardt, of Rockford. Mr Scherzer is facing up to four years in prison after pleading guilty to delivery of marijuana and maintaining a drug house. He admitted growing cannabis plants in a building next to his home in Plainfield Township and supplying pounds of the butter to Bernhardt, who is said to have distributed it among the other officers. While his wife Alyssa Scherzer admitted being aware of the operation and allowing it in her home, she said her involvement was limited to occasionally watering the plants. She pleaded guilty to maintaining a drug house, which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison.

Corrections officers Mike Fredrick, left and Brian Tennant, right. Investigators do not believe any canbnabis butter entered the prisons where they worked . Under the Michigan Medical Marijuana Act, patients are allowed to smoke marijuana but those eating cannabis-laced food such as marijuana butter are not protected from prosecution. Lawyers representing the corrections officers tried but failed to have the case thrown on on the grounds that the questioning of the officers was invalid. Frederick, Tennant and Bernhardt are charged with charged with delivery and manufacturing of a controlled substance, four-year offenses. VanDoorne is charged with the two-year offense of maintaining a drug house and the one year offense of possession of marijuana.

'This . operation could be pushed forward by the technical sponsor, who . Balotelli shares with Arsenal. To have Balotelli in the Premier League . for Arsenal would be an important investment.' Arsene . Wenger has an admiration for Balotelli but remains keen on Mario .

Another target, Alvaro Morata of Real Madrid, is in discussions over a possible move to Villarreal. Blade Harry could cut it for Tigers as Davies talks continue . Hull City are showing interest in Sheffield United defender Harry Maguire and will open talks with Curtis Davies over a new contract. The 29-year-old Davies has been outstanding this season and that has attracted interest from Newcastle and Everton. It is a pivotal contract for Davies who has rebuilt his reputation under Steve Bruce's tutelage after an inauspicious time at Aston Villa which was hampered by poor form and injury. Bruce has made a new centre-back his priority for the summer along with the signing of Jake Livermore. Tiger time? Sheffield United's Harry Maguire is being tracked by Premier League Hull City . Sportsmail reported last month that Crystal Palace have an interest in Livermore too but the player is keen to return to Hull if they can negotiate a suitable fee with Tottenham. That is not easy and will have a bearing on Bruce's other targets Michael Dawson and Joleon Lescott. Dawson is keen to see whether he has a future at Tottenham first. Maguire, 21, has been the subject of two failed bids by Wolves and League One Sheffield United want more than the £2m that has been discussed so far. Pepe is too pricey for Napoli as Spaniard returns to Liverpool . Napoli will struggle to take Pepe Reina back to Italy because of his wages. The Spaniard has returned to Liverpool and is waiting for talks with manager Brendan Rodgers about his future. Rodgers has been looking to bring in a second goalkeeper to give competition to Simon Mignolet and was looking at Swansea's Michel Vorm until the Welsh club valued him at £8m. Spot on: Pepe Reina saves a Balotelli penalty during his loan spell at Napoli this season . The belief is that Liverpool will look to strike a compromise and maybe subsidise Reina's departure to help him reach agreement with a new club over his salary. Atletico Madrid did hold an interest but have signed Miguel Moya from neighbours Getafe and may look at Petr Cech in negotiations with Chelsea over Thibaut Courtois. Arsenal have also been contacted although they have spoken to Cardiff about David Marshall too among several others. Ole eyes Dikgacoi with former Palace midfielder set to join Bluebirds . Cardiff City are in discussions over a deal for South African midfielder Kagisho Dikgacoi. The 29-year-old turned down a new contract at Crystal Palace and is a free agent. He is poised to sign for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and will become the Norwegian's fifth summer recruit. From Eagle to Bluebird: Kagisho Dikgacoi is poised to sign for Cardiff from Crystal Palace . Bouremouth have made a second bid for Coventry striker Callum Wilson after having a £1million offer turned down earlier this month. Millwall have made an improved offer for Halifax Town striker Lee Gregory. They had an initial bid of around £150,000 rejected for the 25-year-old. Joao's going nowhere for now as Atletico dig heels in . Atletico Madrid are refusing to negotiate over the transfer of centre-back Joao Miranda insisting clubs meet his buy-out clause of £24.2million if they want to buy him. The Spanish champions are wary that coach Diego Simeone is growing frustrated at the sales taking place with Diego Costa and Filipe Luis heading to Chelsea with free agent Tiago. Midfielder Koke is also the subject of fevered interest but all interested parties are being referred to his buy-out clause of £48m. Tight grip: Atletico Madrid are keeping on to defender Joao Miranda (riight), pictured with Roberto Soldado, then of Valencia . Simeone wants to build on the success of last season but with his squad being dismantled to pay off debts he is concerned at what will be left. Miranda turns 30 in September and has reached an impasse in talks over a new contract. Manchester City, United and Barcelona have all shown an interest although United insist they have not made any offer. City have Eliaquim Mangala and Roma's Mehdi Benatia at the top of their wishlist and will open talks with Porto over a deal for Mangala after the World Cup despite his public declaration of love for Chelsea and also admitting he was partial to United. Atletico meanwhile are considering Mateo Musacchio of Villarreal to replace Miranda should he eventually go. It's no Shaw thing but United are still Luke-ing to Saints star . Manchester United remain determined to conclude a deal for Luke Shaw. The final sign off has been delayed while Southampton search for a new manager. The south coast club are keen to get the optimum price should they sell their players after initially intimating that around £27m would be enough. They are also looking at options of players in return although may struggle to attract some as they continue to lose their own big names. Arsenal remain keen on Morgan Schneiderlin and Calum Chambers and Liverpool will re-package a bid for Adam Lallana but will only go so far. Dejan Lovren, Dani Osvaldo, Victor Wanyama and Jay Rodriguez are also looking to leave. Saint is no Devil, yet: Southampton and England left-back Luke Shaw remains a target of Manchester United . Will Pape put pen to paper at Loftus Road? Pape Souare is being considered by Queens Park Rangers as they weigh up potential recruits for left-back. The Senegal international who figured for his country at the Olympics currently plays for Lille in France. The 24-year-old has also had a spell on loan at Reims. Souare was linked with Arsenal earlier this season after their scouts watched several Lille games. Arsene Wenger was also asking for reports on Belgian starlet Divock Origi, 19, who plays up front at Lille. Charley's got the Edge as he signs up to World Football agency . Everton youngster Charley Edge has signed up to Monaco-based agency World Football. The promising 17-year-old from Aberystwyth is a Wales U17 international and joined Everton at 14 after initially signing with Swansea then Stoke City. He can play across the front line and has caught the eye with performances for the club's U18s.

"Claims by a former senior Victorian government adviser that he provided pornography for coalition MPs have been described as bizarre by Premier Denis Napthine. Don Coulson was an adviser to former premier Ted Baillieu and was sacked in March last year just days after Dr Napthine became premier. He has reportedly launched a County Court action claiming $67,000 and costs in redundancy payments he alleges he is owed. The government has countersued, reportedly alleging Mr Coulson must return $30,000 in severance pay because he had pornography in his office. Scroll down for video . Former Victorian premier Ted Baillieu (left), who's advisor claims he provided pornography for coalition MPs. However Premier Denis Napthine (right) has described this as bizarre . Mr Coulson claims he ran a 'porn ring' that lent adult movies to coalition MPs and advisers from his office, the Herald Sun reports. 'These are bizarre and absurd allegations by a disaffected, sacked employee,' Dr Napthine told reporters on Thursday. 'They are not worth the paper they are written on.' Mr Napthine said he was advised the material was inappropriate but not illegal, and said Mr Coulson had been sacked for other matters not related to this. 'Mr Coulson is lashing out as a disaffected, sacked employee and he is making bizarre allegations,' he said. Mr Coulson, 59, was a former public servant who had worked with Mr Baillieu in opposition and was in charge of the government's Freedom of Information strategy before he was sacked, the Herald Sun reports. It is also believed that some of the sexually explicit material included animal pornography. But Mr Coulson has told the Herald Sun and ABC radio he will vigorously defend the allegation that he accessed pornography on any government system. He told the ABC that he used USBs in his office to circulate 'hardcore' porn because staff were prohibited from acquiring such material on government computers. The Age reported that Mr Coulson had 'at least three memory sticks'. Deputy Labor leader James Merlino described the allegations as shocking and needed to be investigated by police. 'This would be breaking every rule, every code of conduct, common sense, decency,' Mr Merlino told Fairfax Radio. 'This needs to be referred and investigated immediately by Victoria Police and federal police in regards to allegations of illegal pornographic material. 'Denis Napthine can't sweep this under the carpet. He needs to make a full and frank explanation to the parliament today. What did he know? How long has he known it?

"It's the horror wedding story which  turned a couple's perfect day of celebrations into a horror story. Matt and Laurie Young had returned home to celebrate their Canadian wedding with their Australian friends, inviting them to a guest hall reception at Narabeen, on Sydney's northern beaches, where they asked for cash and vouchers as gifts, instead of presents. But during the celebrations - when they were joined by up to 100 guests - thieves ransacked their wishing well and stole thousands of dollars donated to them by loving friends and family. Scroll down for video . Matt and Laurie Young are putting a call out to others to be wary of opportunistic thieves at weddings . The money was to be the helping hand the couple needed to start their new life together and put it towards a new home. But instead the Youngs have been left shattered by the thought that someone close to them could have potentially taken the cash. Now they are warning of  others celebrating their special day of opportunistic thieves thinking of doing the same. 'We were in complete shock and disbelief,' Mrs Young told The Sunday Telegraph. The pair had left their money in the hall overnight where they presumed it would be  safe until they re-visited the following day. 'We were in complete shock and disbelief' Mrs Young and her husband were shattered by the thought that it could have been someone close to them who took the money .

"Finally, after 22 minutes inside the Sun Life Stadium, the combination of Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge crackled into life. Sadly, after a lightning storm interrupted England’s final friendly before the World Cup, we only ever got to see flashes of the pairing’s potential. On Saturday evening, when England face Italy in the opening group game of the World Cup in Manaus, it will have to come together. Room for improvement: Daniel Sturridge (left) failed to find the back of the net against Honduras . Going for goal: Wayne Rooney (left) bends a free-kick towards goal during the first half . Rooney was substituted at half-time on Saturday night, but the duo will still be paired against Italy. Rooney and Sturridge haven’t played nearly enough football together and this was the last chance before the team flew overnight to their Rio de Janeiro training base. Sturridge really should have scored when Danny Welbeck and Rooney broke through the Honduras defence midway through the first half. The Liverpool striker, who turned neatly inside the penalty area, skewed his shot wide of the target. Sturridge has scored four times for his country and will know that he could have easily added another. It will come and he doesn’t care who his partner is. He’s in top form, flush full of confidence after scoring 21 goals for Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League. There is a maturity about his game — he is a willing team player in Hodgson’s disciplined and organised 4-2-3-1 formation. It feels as though he is England’s main goal threat — the most likely to change a game in the same way that Gary Lineker did in his country’s colours. Frustrated figure: Sturridge kicks out at a post after a save from Honduras goalkeeper Noel Valladares (left) Dejected: Rooney trudges off the pitch after England's disappointing 0-0 draw with Honduras . There were bursts from Rooney, too, after England’s head coach restored him to his favoured position for this final work-out. The Manchester United striker is the only player to start all three friendlies ahead of the World Cup. He didn’t finish this one, however, and was replaced by the livewire Ross Barkley for the second period. Next week, Rooney must turn it on in tournament football. That was his promise in Portugal when he arrived in Vale do Lobo a full week ahead of schedule to make sure that he was in shape this summer. He owes England at a World Cup, particularly after his subdued performances in 2006 and 2010. This is his chance.

Pressure: Rooney (left) has failed to score a World Cup goal for England despite making the squad in 2006 and 2010 .

They were forced into a campus gym because of the hurricane season and on Saturday, with the score 0-0, the teams had to leave the field of play. England were well aware of the risks when they booked their week-long stay in Miami and went ahead with the plan. Hodgson remains convinced that his squad are ready for the challenges ahead when they arrive at base camp in Rio. What they will need now is some positive forward thinking.","Rooney and Sturridge failed to score as England drew 0-0 with Honduras .

"American Jason Millard has been disqualified from next week's US Open after belatedly calling a penalty on himself in qualifying. Millard, who qualified in Memphis, Tennessee on June 2, was playing his third shot on the 18th hole of Colonial Country Club's North Course - his 27th hole of the day - when the penalty occurred. Out: Millard's mistake in Memphis was a costly one . 'I'm pretty sure I grounded my club in the bunker,' said Millard, who was not disqualified until June 7. 'I didn't see anything for sure but I felt something and I saw a small indentation. 'It happened so fast I really don't know 100 per cent, but deep down I believe I did. I couldn't find peace about it. For five days I practised and I couldn't get it off my mind. 'It's heart-breaking but what I was feeling in my heart didn't feel right.

At this time we have no recourse but to disqualify him under the Rules of Golf and specifically Rule 34-1b.' Rule 34-1b effectively states that a competitor must be disqualified after the competition has closed if he has returned a score which failed to include a penalty which, before the competition closed, he knew he had incurred.

"England were put through their final paces on Friday while coming to terms with a slapstick setback, as Danny Care was ruled out of the first Test against New Zealand following an ‘hilarious’ training-ground accident that soon turned sour. The Harlequins scrum-half was officially withdrawn from Saturday’s series opener against the All Blacks at Eden Park once it became apparent that he had failed to recover from a shoulder injury in time to play. His removal means that Ben Youngs of Leicester will join forces with Freddie Burns in an untried half-back combination, while Lee Dickson comes on to the bench. It emerged that Care’s injury stemmed from an incident on Monday that initially prompted much amusement among team-mates and management. Asked how the 27-year-old had hurt his shoulder, defence coach Andy Farrell said: ‘It’s his own fault actually. Tradition: The England team walk onto the pitch during the Captain's Run at Eden Park . Put your back into it: Rob Webber pushes a weights sled . Grappling: The England team warm up during the training session . Pulling: Kyle Eastmond, the England centre, pulls a weights sled during the training session . Hard at work: Tom Johnson pushes a weights sled as England train for the final time . The All Blacks haven’t lost at Eden Park since 1994. They were beaten by France 20 years ago but have since won 31 Tests in a row. ‘It was a . s**t kick. He actually stubbed his foot on the floor, missed the ball . completely and it was absolutely hilarious. He fell over and hurt his . shoulder. I burst out laughing but then realised it wasn’t too funny. ‘It . was a little grubber through on the floor, which he mis-kicked. He . won’t be doing it again. I’ve got it on tape. I showed it to all the . lads the next day; it was hilarious. But it wasn’t quite as good two . days later when he wasn’t playing in the Test match. Anyway, we’ll get . over it.’ The . joke lost its appeal very quickly, as the loss of Care is another . grievous blow to English hopes of causing an upset in the opening clash . with the world champions. He was an integral part of the team’s . attacking development during the Six Nations and his vibrant presence . will be sorely missed. Yet, . Farrell suggested the coaches are optimistic that the Yorkshireman will . be available for selection in Dunedin next week. ‘He was very close,’ he said. ‘He's a couple of days off and we expect him to be fully fit . for next week, but his strength wasn't quite there. Lookout: Stuart Lancaster runs the rule over his England charges at Eden Park . Faster! Chris Pennell takes a sprint test as England prepare for the All Blacks . Where's the pass? Marland Yarde takes control of the ball during training . ‘He's . settling down nicely, but the player has to be mentally right that he's . 100 per cent fit. We have good replacements in Ben and Lee. Danny will . rest this one out and start training again on Monday and Tuesday next . week. ‘He's been in great form, not just throughout the Six Nations when he was outstanding, but he finished the season really well at Harlequins. In general he was in very confident mood coming over here and was looking forward to the tour.’ England have been beset by the absence of so many leading lights for this first Test, due to a pile-up of injuries and fixtures. But the tourists are refusing to be demoralised and accept a grisly fate against Steve Hansen’s experienced, outstanding Kiwi team. Farrell claimed that the visitors will take heart from some rousing performances and results on the road in the last two years. ‘We’re not frightened of the occasion – of going to these places and giving it a good crack,’ he said. 'For some of these guys, it’s new to come here, it was new to go to South Africa and for some of them it was new to play in Paris. Everything is new to us but we don’t shirk it. There is always a fighting spirit there. The fighting spirit has been in this team since the start.’ Sitting it out: Danny Care (right) will miss England's first Test with New Zealand on Saturday .

Tough task: England are preparing to face New Zealand but will be huge underdogs . Breather: James Haskell takes a break after the training session . Preparation: England face a daunting challenge in New Zealand . The All Blacks haven’t lost at Eden Park since 1994. Their imperious record in their Auckland lair and their dominance of this rivalry over the decades is a grim omen for England, but they are determined to ignore it. ‘We know we’ve only won twice here,’ said Farrell. ‘We know we’ve only beaten the All Blacks seven times. ‘We are aware of the history, but we’re more aware of our own history of late and that’s a side that started two years ago and guys are averaging 20-25 caps. They’ve been through a journey together and we’re seeing the improvements. There’s still a long way to go, but we need to come to places like New Zealand, to test ourselves and see where we’re at.’","Danny Care will miss New Zealand Test after falling in training .

It is without a shadow of a doubt that Martinez has two real gems to prowl his flanks – Baines and Coleman are both competent in defence and exquisite going forward. Yet, until Everton’s mini-revival in recent weeks, they were the lone bright sparks in a campaign in which Everton were jammed in first gear and struggling to find the clutch pedal. Coleman has scored three goals for Everton so far this season, picking up one assist along the way . Former Wigan defender Baines has grabbed an impressive eight assists in all competitions . The first season honeymoon at Goodison is well and truly over for Martinez and the Spaniard has found his second campaign a heck of a lot tougher. Kick-off: Thursday, November 6, 8.05pm . TV: ITV4 from 5.30pm . Primarily the heart of his defence has been found wanting. With 14 games played in all competitions Everton have leaked 22 goals – including 12 on their own patch in just three matches against Swansea City, Chelsea and Crystal Palace. Unfortunately for the Toffees, Phil Jagielka has looked every bit his 32 years too often during those matches, frequently being beaten for pace or out-foxed by clever movement. Antolin Alcaraz – although unfortunate with injuries – has never quite looked an Everton player since his switch from Wigan Athletic and, at 36, even Slyvain Distin is understandably now losing his seemingly endless powers of longevity. Baines celebrates scoring a penalty during Everton's 4-1 Europa League win against Wolfsburg . And, just to compound Martinez’s problems, the extremely promising John Stones has found himself on the treatment table just when he was showing what a class performer he could become. Martinez was beginning to build his whole side around the 20-year-old England international until an ankle injury cruelly robbed him of the versatile defender out until at least the New Year. But he still has two very big reasons to be positive – and their names are Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman. For while Everton may have been conceding far more frequently than they would like this season, they are also scoring at a rate of two goals per game – a ratio helped tremendously by their marauding full backs. In 15 appearances this season, Baines has scored twice and assisted on an incredible eight occasions. Coleman, meanwhile, has bagged three goals and contributed an assist in 10 appearances. Samuel Eto'o is tackled by Simon Kjaer during Everton's 0-0 Group G draw against Lille in October . However, the Irishman’s real importance to Everton can be highlighted by their results during his month-long absence between the middle of September through until October due to injury. In the four games Coleman missed, Everton failed to win once and conceded seven times. Since his return against Aston Villa on October 18, the Toffees have won twice, drawn one and conceded just once. Martinez’s assessment of Coleman and Baines as ‘the best pair of full backs in England’ may be contested by the likes of Manuel Pellegrini – who has Gael Clichy, Aleksandar Kolarov, Bacary Sagna and Pablo Zabaleta at his disposal at Manchester City – but few sides rely so heavily on players tasked with defending the flanks. Everton’s success is based on their full backs having the freedom to roam up and down the touchlines as they please – and they will be the key to defining the success of the season. Phil Jagielka (left) has been part of an Everton defence which has leaked 22 goals this season . Expectations have risen and a trophy is desperately craved by the Goodison faithful. Supporters narrowly missed out on the Champions League last term having finished outside of the top four, but the Europa League could in fact be the Toffees’ gateway to taking on the continent's very best in the future. For the first time ever, the winners of the Europa League will automatically qualify for the Champions League – either through the play-offs, or, a likely scenario in Everton's case, straight into the group stage should the victors in Europe's top competition gain entry via their league position. Everton will be hoping to keep Liverpool-bound striker Divock Origi quiet at Goodison Park . With Everton having battled to a 0-0 draw at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy two weeks ago, the Toffees know they are capable of shutting out Liverpool’s on-loan Divock Origi and Co when Lille come to town. But it is up the other end of the pitch where they must impress upon a side sitting a lowly 12th in Ligue 1 at Goodison on Thursday, live on ITV4 (8.05pm kick-off). And, as Martinez will tell you, it is Everton’s top-class full backs who hold the key to Europa League success this season – both against Lille and hopefully beyond. It is Martinez’s full backs who can march Everton through the gateway towards the promised land of the Champions League by leading the Toffees on the Road to Warsaw this season.

"A beloved Standard Oil heiress who drove an old station wagon and wore jeans has shocked her former high school by leaving them $40 million in her will - and nothing to her relatives. Ruth Bedford, the last surviving grandchild of Standard Oil director Edward T. Bedford, was two months shy of her 100th birthday when she passed away in her sleep at her Greens Farms, Connecticut home on June 15. Bedford, who lived humbly despite her fortune, had told Foxcroft School, a small all-girls school in Middleburg, Virginia, that she was going to leave them money, but they only learned of the sum after her death. Humble life: Ruth Bedford, pictured left as a student at Foxcroft School in Virginia and right in her later years, left $40 million to her alma mater. She passed away in Connecticut in June, aged 99 . The $40 million bequest is likely the largest gift ever made to an all-girls school and one of the largest gifts to a secondary school from a woman, school officials told the Washington Post. 'Our students will directly benefit as we expand the experiential learning that has always been a hallmark of a Foxcroft education, refresh our physical plant, and strengthen our scholarship offerings,' Cathy McGehee, Foxcroft's head of school, said in a statement. Staff at the school, which has just 157 students, said some of the gift will be set aside to establish a scholarship in Bedford's name and some will be used to commemorate her love of theater. Bedford attended the small countryside school between 1928 and 1932. The institution, which has an equestrian program, had a lasting impact on Bedford, who was a talented rider and active on the basketball and cheerleading teams, her grandniece, Libby McKinney Tritschler, said. Accomplished: Bedford, top left with her basketball teammates, was a natural athlete who enjoyed horse riding, cheerleading and sailing. She later worked as a volunteer during WWII and a Broadway stage hand . Loved: Bedford, pictured right during her school days, also learned how to pilot a sea plane . She added that it was not surprisingly that Bedford, who was never married and had no children, did not leave anything in her estate for family members. Wealthy: She was the only surviving grandchild of Standard Oil's director Edward T. Bedfor . 'It was never about the money for my family,' she told the Washington Post. 'Money wasn't what they lived off of. They really gave back to their community.' Bedford was one of three surviving children of the son of Edward T. Bedford, who served as director of Standard Oil in the early 1900s, and grew up on her family's 17-acre estate in Westport. She grew up seeing her father, industrialist, farmer and philanthropist Frederick T. Bedford, and mother donate large sums to local hospitals and charities. After Bedford left Foxcroft, she served with the Red Cross during the London Blitz before moving to New York to work on Broadway as a Rodgers and Hammerstein production hand. She also raced thoroughbreds that won stakes at Saratoga and Belmont, and became a skilled pilot after she had been inspired to take up the hobby by the man she loved. She never married but she was known to have fallen for Briggs Cunningham, a millionaire race-car driver who later featured on the cover of Time. Bedford took up flying, hoping she would get to spend more time with him because he often flew to Long Island on business, the Post reported. Good life: After leaving school, she volunteered with the Red Cross and then moved to New York City . Strong: She had fallen in love with a millionaire race car driver Briggs Cunningham, pictured right, as a teenager and took up flying to impress him. But her sister married him and Bedford never wed . Thrill-seeker: Friends remembered Bedford as a skilled sailor, pilot, golfer and tennis player . But Cunningham's attentions were elsewhere - with her sister Lucie. The pair married in October 1929 and went on to have children. Lucie was known as a successful yachtsman. Bedford never had a love interest after losing 'her one true love', her grand-niece said. For the past five decades, she instead devoted her life to her community, her local hospital and her animals; she tended to pigs, llamas and thoroughbred horses. She lived a humble life; she drove an Oldsmobile station wagon and donned jeans to muck out her horses. She also enjoyed drinking scotch. She was also a skilled sailor, golfer, tennis player and aviatrix, and friends remembered her as 'generous, unpretentious, with a zest for life, a beautiful smile and laugh, and an interest in everybody around her no matter their position in society', Leesburg Today reported. Thankful: Foxcroft School is in the countryside in Middleburg, Virginia and has just 157 students . The countryside school has 157 students - a quarter of whom are from 15 foreign countries - and yearly tuition us $50,900 for boarding and $42,900 for day students. Its alumni include women from the Rockefeller, Carnegie, Mellon and Astor families. Students will be informed of the gift on Tuesday.","Ruth Bedford, the last surviving grandchild of Standard Oil director Edward T.

"Andy Murray made a comfortable start to the grass-court season in front of new coach Amelie Mauresmo as he beat Paul-Henri Mathieu in straight sets at the AEGON Championships. The Brit took one hour and 26 minutes to beat French world 92 Mathieu 6-4, 6-4 in his first match at the Queen's Club as he prepares for the defence of his Wimbledon title. Click here for full match report . Host commentator . Well that's it from me here. Andy Murray cruises through in style at Queen's as his grasscourt season under the coaching of Amelie Mauresmo begins in style. Thanks for following and cheerio. 'The ideal 86-minute match for Murray to kick off his grass-court season in terms of rhythm. Impressive performance from the Wimbledon champion who was on top throughout. 'His next match will likely be much trickier against Czech Radek Stepanek, who likes to serve and volley and charge forward at any opportunity.' Serving for the match, Murray begins by delivering an ace out wide, before edging 30-0 head. A crosscourt forehand winner into the corner brings up three match points, but Mathieu delays the seemingly inevitable before Murray serves out to 15 to record a comfortable victory . Murray's being made to wait, but Mathieu twice blows the chance to serve out a hold at advantage. Another ace from the Frenchman gives him advantage, before an excellently judged drop shot from the Frenchman is followed by a perfect baseline lob to hold out in style. And the heat is on now for Mathieu. Murray edges 0-30 in front but Mathieu fights back, including an ace out wide to level. Murray regains momentum to move into match point, but can only fire into the net to bring up deuce. Mathieu attempts to stay in a rally with a blind lob played between his legs, but the ball just bounces out and Murray easily serves out thereafter to leave Mathieu serving to stay in the match. Mathieu goes against the script to move 0-30 in front after punishing the Murray second serve. Murray gets his first serve back into gear to hit a wide ace, but a double fault from the Brit gives the Frenchman two break points. The Scot survives the first as Mathieu can only return a serve way off court, while a 132mph serve is un-returnable and brings up deuce. Well saved, Andy. While Mathieu can't get to the Murray serve, the Scot threatens to break again as he gains two break points. Mathieu survives the first by forcing an error from the British No. 1, but an error from the Frenchman enables Murray to get the break. Oh Goran, always breaking British hearts. I still haven't forgiven him for beating Tim Henman in the 2001 Wimbledon semi-final. Meanwhile, Murray's ears must be burning from the debate, as he blitzes through another service hold to love - although this isn't quite 38 seconds. 'Currently some debate as to whether that 38-second hold from Murray in the second game of this set is one of, if not the fastest game ever. 'I certainly can't recall seeing a quicker game, although one expert reckons Goran Ivanisevic held serve in 35 seconds against Pete Sampras in the 1998 Wimbledon final.' Astonishing point. Murray and Mathieu exchange in a battle involving net shots and lobs, but the Scot comes out the loser as he is left eating the grass at Queen's desperately trying to return a cross court return. It's the boost the Frenchman needs, as he serves out with ease. Straight forward hold for Murray to 30. Mathieu has troubled the Scot at times but cannot do it often enough to really leave the British No.1 in any bother. Mathieu unearths the box of tricks again with a disguised drop shot but follows up with a return out wide to reset deuce. A Murray backhand to the baseline sees Mathieu powerfully fire into the net but at break point Murray can't see the game out as the Frenchman gradually takes control of a rally which ends with another delicate drop shot out of the Scot's reach. It's as close as Murray gets to breaking, as Mathieu takes the next two points to keep this set on serve. Mathieu tries the quick service game tactic himself as he too eases 30-0 but Murray soon draws level as the Frenchman double faults. Murray takes the next point to gain a break point, but Murray is left fooled by a disguised serve as Mathieu goes down the T to grab an ace and deuce. Wow - in 38 seconds Murray holds! Two aces and two poor returns from Mathieu see that service game done and dusted. Have we ever seen a service game end as quick as that? Murray challenges a call out to his shot out wide without success, falling 30-15 behind, before a superb forehand baseline winner from Mathieu sees him edge closer to a hold. Murray attacks the net with purpose to cushion a volley winner for 40-30 but Mathieu then leaves Murray rooted to the spot firing another winner to hold. 'Very comfortable first set for Murray after Mathieu threw away the break in the opening game. The Brit strong on serve and moving well. 'If Murray comes through, he'll take on wily Czech veteran Radek Stepanek who has just defeated Aussie bad boy Bernard Tomic in two tiebreak sets.' The match might be slipping away from Mathieu, and his feet are following as he again loses his balance trying to return a Murray serve for 15-0. The Scot meanwhile moves into two set points with ease. Mathieu hits a neat backhand winner to the baseline but can only return wide on the next point as Murray takes the first set. Mathieu takes advantage before Murray pegs back for a second deuce, before the Frenchman gradually sneaks to the net to hit a simple winner before holding out. But how long for? Murray now serves for the set. Mathieu is serving to stay in the set and is soon under pressure at 0-30 down, only to respond be winning the next two points for 30-30. Murray attacks a second serve with the backhand, and it leads to Mathieu returning into the net to bring up set point, one which Mathieu holds out to bring up deuce. Fortune favours the Frenchman as he clips the net cord leaving Murray helpless to respond at 15-15, but Murray soon presses on, holding out to 15 with a delicate lob. As Murray runs side-to-side to stay in a rally, Mathieu puts him out of his misery with a half volley, only for Murray to respond on the next point with a winner. Deuce two sees Mathieu edge ahead again before he sends an ace out wide to hold. And Mathieu is staring down the barrel again. An attempted forehand winner down the line is narrowly out for 15-30 but the Frenchman responds with an ace down the T. A Murray return sees Mathieu cushion a volley over the net, but a double fault from the Frenchman brings up deuce. Blink and you'll miss it. At 15-15, Murray moves 30-15 ahead before rifling another wide ace and forcing an instant error out of Mathieu on the next point to see out his serve. 'Solid start from Murray, already showing the deft touch which makes his game so strong on grass. 'Murray hasn't lost on grass since the defeat to Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final in 2012, and a win today would be his 19th consecutive win on the surface.' Murray is still finding his feet on grass, making a few basic unforced errors. Mathieu's having a few issues himself as he is slipping all over the place but manages to hold his serve. And that's the last Mathieu sees of Murray's service game, as the Scot takes advantage before serving an ace out wide to hold. Bold from Mathieu, who turns up the heat with a stunning lobbed topspin volley... only to be met by a Murray ace for 30-15. Murray then hits a rather simple forehand into the net before he returns wide to hand Mathieu break point. It's survived though as the Frenchman rifles into the net. Deuce. More carnage on the way for Mathieu who double faults for 0-30, before we finally see some skill from the Frenchman who hits a neat cross court backhand winner. Mathieu then levels at 30-30, before somehow hitting a winner at the net despite slipping while running to get there. Impressive. The recovery is complete as Murray's attempted lob is met by a neat drop shot which the Scot just cannot reach. Murray also easily skates 40-0 ahead, but he too shows an inability to serve out to love as Mathieu ends an eight-point losing run to pull a point back. Murray's in no mood to mess about too much though as he serves out. The Mathieu capitulation is complete as Murray wins five points in a row to break serve straight away. The Mauresmo factor? Probably not, and the French woman shows barely flicker of emotion courtside. Away we go then, it's Murray's first match in the UK since winning Wimbledon last year and he faces Paul-Henri Mathieu's serve to begin his Queen's Club title defence. It's certainly not an easy start as the Frenchman shows no sign of nerves to skate into a 40-0 lead. But after firing into the net and being beaten by a cross court winner, Mathieu is soon pegged back to 40-30, before he smashes an overhead shot straight into the net. Deuce we go - when it really should have been a straight forward hold. 'It feels like the beginning of a new era here at Queen's as Amelie Mauresmo takes her seat in Andy Murray's courtside box. 'It may only be an ""era"" which lasts for four weeks, though, as the groundbreaking appointment is only initially for the grass court season as both parties figure out whether it can work long-term.' Yes, Andy Murray is back on these shores and is now out on court to defend his Queen's Club crown which he won last year (it wasn't just Wimbledon folks). All the second round action against Paul Henri-Mathieu will be coming up very soon.","Murray playing won 6-4, 6-4 second round after being given first round bye for Wimbledon warm-up tournament .

"As the woman to finally tame the world’s most eligible bachelor, Amal Alamuddin has been the subject of much discussion among George Clooney’s family. But his relatives were left disappointed when work commitments kept the stunning human rights lawyer in the UK when the Oscar winner, 53, made his annual trip to Augusta, Kentucky last week - while his parents Nick and Nina had even painted their house in preparation. However, many of the Clooney clan will soon have their chance to meet Amal, 36, as the star's aunt Starla Clooney today exclusively confirms to MailOnline the couple WILL wed in Italy in September.

Starla lives in Hamilton, Ohio, with her husband Joe, 60,  who is George’s uncle, where she works as a non-denominational minister, officiating events including weddings in prisons at the nearby Lebanon and Warren Correctional Institutions. And asked about the wedding, she said: ‘I did hear Cincinnati, since it’s not that far from Kentucky - that’s one of the places they were considering - but apparently Cincinnati didn’t win, it's not going to be the place. ‘I do know that Nick and Nina are planning a trip over to Italy in the next week or so to, I guess, scope out some stuff.' Starla also thinks the actor and producer will choose one of his Hollywood friends over a family member when it comes to picking a best man, saying: 'I would say he’d choose Brad Pitt for his best man. They are good friends, I would think that’s who he’d choose.’ But she offered her services to preside over a local service if Clooney and Amal decided to have another ceremony in case family can't travel to Italy, adding: 'Sure, I'd do it in a heartbeat!'

"Joel Campbell has proved himself in the Champions League, La Liga, Ligue 1, Greek Super League and now, on the biggest stage of them all, the World Cup. But the forward, having spent three of his five-year deal with Arsenal on loan to other clubs, is yet to be given a chance in the Premier League by Arsene Wenger. The 21-year-old put in a commanding performance for Costa Rica in their 3-1 win over Uruguay, scoring one and setting up another, but will that be enough to make it on to the Arsenal manager's radar or will it go unnoticed for another year? VIDEO: Scroll down to see Arsenal's Joel Campbell score a belter for Costa Rica . Goal: Joel Campbell scores for Costa Rica in their surprise 3-1 win over Uruguay in the Group D opener .

His strike in the 54th minute brought Costa Rica level, having taken a moment to control the ball, set himself and beat goalkeeper Fernando Muslera with a superb half-volley. They went on to score two more, securing a surprise win over a Uruguay lacking striker Luis Suarez. The third and killer goal by substitute Marco Urena was set up by an inch-perfect through-ball by Campbell, too. Even towards the dying minutes, the youngster was winning corners to eat up time and, albeit inadvertently, was fouled by a frustrated Maxi Pereira, who saw red for the ugly challenge. Chance: Campbell scored one, assisted another, killed time towards the end and was fouled in the red card . Missing: Campbell couldn't find himself in Panini . Joel Campbell may have struggled to find a sticker of himself before the World Cup began but he certainly made himself known to those unaware of his talents with a superb display against Uruguay. The Arsenal striker infamously bought 100 packs of Panini World Cup stickers in April – and failed to find a single one of him. He posted an image including a pile of what he says is 100 opened packets, each of which include five stickers so 500 in total, and lamented that none of them included him. On loan at Olympiacos last season, the 21-year-old shone in the Champions League last 16 round against Manchester United, and his latest match-winning performance in Brazil will not have gone unnoticed by Arsene Wenger. Campbell's five-year contract with Arsenal in 2011 has seen him go largely unnoticed at the Emirates. He was shipped out on loan to Ligue 1's Lorient and La Liga's Real Betis, before becoming instrumental in Olympiacos winning the Greek Super League by a landslide 17 points. Campbell is eligible to play for Arsenal, having tweeted his joy at receiving a work permit in July 2013. The World Cup can often act as an audition for players, and Campbell made his chance count. The extent, though, is down to Wenger.

"Jean-Francois Hauteville, 47, was found in his car with a single bullet wound to the head, which police believe was fired from close range . A hunter was arrested today  after a French building contractor was found dead with a bullet in his head on an isolated country road in the French Alps. The horrific murder took place just 50 miles from where three members of a British family died in eerily similar circumstances two years ago. Jean-Francois Hauteville, 47, suffered close-range bullet wounds to the head as he sat in his Peugeot Boxer van in a wooded area near Neuvecelle, close to Lake Geneva in eastern France. The vehicle’s engine was still running when a passer-by found his body slumped behind the steering wheel, with the driver’s window open, early on Wednesday morning. Mr Hauteville was a keen hunter, and French police confirmed tonight that they had arrested and ‘placed under investigation’ a fellow gun enthusiast, who has not been named. It was on September 5th 2012 that Surrey engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, and his wife, Iqbal, 47, died alongside her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74. All suffered bullet wounds to the head as they sat in a BMW estate car, following an attack by a mystery gunman shooting outside, and at close range. The killer, who has never been found, also murdered a French cyclist called Sylvain Mollier, 45, whose body was found next to the estate car. It still had its engine running when the bodies were found by a British cyclist soon after the killings. The Al-Hilli’s daughters, Zainab, seven at the time, and Zeena, four, survived the savage attack close to Lake Annecy. Eric Maillaud, who is leading the investigation into the so-called Alp Murders, has now been tasked with the Neuvecelle killing, which police are certain was a 'murder'. Mr Hauteville was found along an Alpine road near Neuvecelle, 50 miles from where the Al-Hilli family were found in their car near Annency . While refusing to discuss a possible link between the two, Mr Maillaud said: ‘It seems that he was killed by a shotgun after a shot at very close range. 'The van he was driving was stopped in the middle lane, and partially blocking the road. The victim had a face wound.’ He said the arrested man was not a formal suspect, but ‘someone who had a severe dispute with the victim, in relation to the hunt. He had issues with the victim, and because he died, we had no choice but to talk to the suspect, but don’t get carried away.’ Mr Maillaud said Mr Hauteville came from nearby Lugrin, and was a ‘popular member of the community’. An autopsy was due to be carried out on Thursday in Grenoble. Lugrin mayor Jacky Burnet said Mr Hauteville was a ‘well known figure, a dynamic worker who was heavily involved in the local community.’ Police that Mr Hauteville had ‘spoken to the attacker’ before the shooting, which is believed to have happened overnight on Tuesday to Wednesday. Mr Hauteville had a ‘bullet in the temple,’ said a police source. He said he ran a successful business specialising in painting and decorating, and was also a keen hunter. In September, Mr Maillaud said whoever was responsible for the 2012 killings may have got away with the ‘perfect crime’. ‘The further we advance, the less conviction we have,’ he said, saying the enquiry ‘lacks the element of a witness which allows everything to be opened up. On a number of occasions we thought we were on the right track.’ Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife, Iqbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, all died after being shot from close range in their car (pictured) two years ago. The gunman has never been caught . Mr Maillaud said that ‘after two years’ hundreds of people had been interviewed, thousands of documents read, and numerous forensic tests carried out ‘but there is no priority line of investigation that stands out.’ Conceding that the enquiry could go on for years to come, Mr Maillaud said: ‘We have tried everything possible, but we’re perhaps we’re in the presence of the perfect crime.’ There have been claims that Mr Al-Hilli was involved in a dispute over a family inheritance with his brother Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, of Chessington, Surrey. Zaid was last year arrested under suspicion of conspiracy to murder but then released because of a lack of evidence. Investigators say that whoever carried out the crime is likely to be a trained marksman, and to know the local area extremely well. This has led to well-sourced theories that Mr Mollier, the cyclist, may have been the principal target. He had recently left his wife and two children two live with a multi-millioniare heiress, with whom he had just had a baby, and there were said to be tensions in the relationship. The 2011 killings took place in an isolated layby on a mountain road not far from the tiny village of Chevaline. A detective involved in the case said: 'The reality is that whoever did it left no forensic evidence, and disappeared without trace. It is sadly quite possible that this will never be solved.'

"The recession has not only left many Britons worse off financially, it has also damaged their sex lives, according to a survey. It says the average Briton has sex four times a month, compared with seven in 2008 when the years of economic boom gave way to bust. And one in three Britons now does not have sex at all in a typical month. Scroll down for video . The survey suggests that women are increasingly getting their thrills from erotic literature while men are turning to online porn . This is a significant increase – by eight percentage points – since 2008, says the poll of more than 1,000 adults published yesterday. The decrease in regularity of having sex may be one of the reasons why the proportion of Britons saying they are satisfied with their sex life – 63 per cent – has decreased considerably since 2008, when 76 per cent were content. It also seems that the tougher economic times may have had an impact on men’s self-confidence. In 2008 more than half of the men questioned for the poll, carried out by The Observer, said they rated themselves above average in the bedroom. Today, only a third can claim the same confidence. The survey suggests that women are increasingly getting their thrills from erotic literature while men are turning to online porn. Some 53 per cent of women admitted to reading erotic novels such as Fifty Shades of Grey, compared with just 36 per cent of men.

"Roy Hodgson has the third most valuable squad at the World Cup at his disposal, yet they are only joint eighth favourites to win the trophy. Despite having an estimated insurable value of £550million, more than top favourites Brazil (£448.3m) and Argentina (£355.2m) and almost three times that of Group D rivals Italy, not many people think England have a realistic chance of winning the tournament. Lloyd’s of London, who conducted the study with the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr), predicts the most expensive team, Germany, will lift the World Cup at the Maracana on July 13.

They used players’ wages and endorsement incomes to estimate career earnings and calculate the value of each player in the 32 World Cup squads. It showed England’s players are worth on average £23.9m – which is more than the whole of Group D rivals Costa Rica’s squad combined (£18.3m). Mario Balotelli and his ageing Italy team-mates come in at 10th on the list, while Chile, who many tip to be the tournament’s surprise package, are 23rd with a group value of £72m. Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney is England’s highest paid player after signing a new contract worth £300,000-a-week earlier this year.

"Senior Conservatives yesterday lashed out at Ukip defector Mark Reckless for having ‘lied and lied and lied again’. Mr Reckless became the second Tory backbencher in a month to quit the party for Ukip and trigger a by-election – making his announcement on Saturday, just hours before the start of the Conservative conference. His decision provoked a furious backlash in his own constituency – where locals called him and Ukip leader Nigel Farage ‘beer-swilling racists’ when they visited yesterday. Scroll down for video . Tory party chairman Grant Shapps today tore into Mark Reckless who defected to UKIP, claiming he wanted to 'get our country back' Things appeared tense as Mr Reckless was joined on a walkabout with UKIP leader Nigel Farage today . And Mr Reckless was left squirming in an interview as he was played a voicemail he left for Tory HQ promising he would be ‘very, very happy’ to campaign for the party – just hours before he jumped ship in a manner that seemed calculated to do maximum damage. The turncoat MP was unrepentant about his defection, insisting the Tories had broken promises on immigration and reducing the deficit. He told the BBC: ‘What I’m doing is keeping faith with my constituents and keeping my promises to them. ‘You heard the Prime Minister just now say the Conservative-led government was dealing with the deficit and cutting immigration. 'The reality is we’ve increased the national debt by more in five years than even Labour managed in 13 and immigration is now back up to the levels we saw under Labour.’ But Mr Cameron said the MP’s defection, and that of Douglas Carswell last month, were ‘senseless and counter-productive’ – adding that voting Ukip would simply increase the chances of Ed Miliband winning the election. And party chairman Grant Shapps used the opening speech of the conference to mount a sustained attack on Mr Reckless. Mr Shapps declared: ‘He lied and lied and lied again.’ He said the MP had accepted the donations and time of supporters while plotting treachery. ‘We have been betrayed,’ Mr Shapps told Conservative activists. ‘We all know individual MPs don’t succeed on their own. They do so by standing on the shoulders of others. Your shoulders. 'People who volunteered for Mr Reckless, they supported him as a Conservative. People who pounded the streets, they supported him as a Conservative. The pair posed for the cameras in a pub, but Mr Reckless faced increasingly hostile questions from the media . There was some UKIP support on the ground, but it is far from clear that Mr Reckless will hold the seat in the forthcoming by-election . ‘Today, your trust has been abused. You have been cheated. But worse; the people of Rochester and Strood have been cast aside. 'As your party chairman, I share your deep sense of betrayal and anger. We have been let down by somebody who has repeatedly lied to his constituents, and to you: Who said one thing, and then did another.’ Embarrassingly for Mr Reckless, just last month he argued against defecting to Ukip, claiming only Mr Cameron could deliver an in/out referendum on the EU. Mr Reckless was also confronted during a TV interview about a voicemail he left, promising to campaign for the party this weekend. Prime Minister David Cameron today insisted defecting to UKIP was 'senseless and counter-productive'. In the voicemail, he said: ‘It’s Mark Reckless, I’ve just picked up your email about the Birmingham Northfield event. Yes, and I’m very, very happy to do a photo or speak to a coach.’ Eurosceptic Tory MP Mark Pritchard said he had cornered Mr Reckless in the Commons last week and demanded to know whether he was planning to defect, and was told he was not. ‘I would say that Douglas Carswell has been dishonourable with a small d, but Mark Reckless was a capital D,’ he said. Three days before last week’s emergency vote on air strikes on fanatics in Iraq, Mr Reckless sent a message to the Government whips’ office saying: ‘Thanks for your message. I would be happy to support UK action with IS in Iraq e.g. air strikes.’ He then voted against the Government. Mr Shapps said: ‘He lied and lied and lied again.’ Mr Farage yesterday scrapped plans for a ‘WAG tax’ on handbags and shoes – less than 48 hours after it was announced at his party conference. On Friday, the Ukip leader welcomed the idea of raising the rate of VAT to 25 per cent on designer handbags, expensive shoes and sports cars. But yesterday he admitted the policy was ‘dead’ and would not be introduced by the party. He said the tax was no more than a ‘discussion point’ that ‘isn’t going to happen’, adding: ‘As far as I am concerned, it’s dead.’ Mark Reckless abandoned a walk in his constituency with Nigel Farage yesterday – after a rather hostile reception. The Ukip leader and his Tory recruit spent 45 minutes in The Crown pub in Rochester, but made a hasty exit pursued by members of the public. Mr Farage drank his usual pint as Mr Reckless – who earned the nickname ‘Legless’ after a Parliamentary drinking session – nursed an orange juice. Preparing for a hasty exit: Mark Reckless and Nigel Farage at The Crown pub yesterday . Mr Farage left in a car, flanked by security staff, but Mr Reckless used a side door, Sky reported. Tory supporter Mary Prouse, 31, said: ‘I’m disgusted with them even being in Rochester. They are beer-swigging racists in my opinion and I can’t stand them.’ Matt Junes, 44, said: ‘I’m quite surprised by his decision. I personally don’t think it’s right.’ Clair Bishop, 67, said: ‘I think it is a very silly decision. ‘I wasn’t surprised when I heard where they were all meeting today – they spend most of their lives in a pub.’ Mr Reckless, 43, represented Rochester and Strood for the Tories for less than five years before switching to Ukip on Saturday and taking the stage at their party conference in Doncaster. He was dubbed ‘Legless’ after admitting he was too drunk to vote on the first Coalition Budget in 2010. In the pub, Mr Reckless said: ‘I am very proud to be alongside Mr Farage. My ambition now is not for a Tory victory.’ He defected despite assuring colleagues he would stay – but Mr Farage denied that he was dishonest. He said: ‘He finally made his mind up yesterday that he was going to do it. There’s no problem with that . . . He hasn’t changed his policies.’ As he walked down the high street later, Mr Reckless denied the visit had been cut short and claimed he had done the walkabout before visiting the pub.","Furious Conservatives condemn defector who denied he was jumping ship .

"A West Australian man has infuriated local police after he allegedly taxied a plane down to his local pub. Officers from the small town of Newman, in West Australia's Pilbara region, were called to the Newman Hotel Purple Pub at 2pm on Friday where the small yellow plane had been parked outside. The small two-seater aircraft, which had no wings, was seen driving down to the pub with its propeller running, according to witnesses. A small two-seater plane, with no wings, was found parked outside a local pub in West Australia's Newman by police officers on Friday . 'The driver had gone into the pub and police conducted an interview, but he wasn't very forthcoming about telling us what was going on,' Sergeant Mark Mckenzie told Daily Mail Australia. 'People could say it was funny but one gust of wind or a circumstance where kids run out onto the road and it would have been very dangerous. 'There was a busy service station outside the pub, the pub itself and kids leaving school at the time. 'The plane doesn't have a steering wheel, it's directed by foot pedals and it didn't have any wings, but the propeller was going. That's how he was propelling his way through and that's where the danger would come from if anyone ran into it.' A bar tender at the Newman Hotel (pictured) said  customers cheered the man on through his interview with police and had dubbed him a 'legend' A bar tender at the Newman Hotel told Daily Mail Australia that the 37-year-old driver of the plane entertained pub patrons by 'playing dumb' when being questioned by police. She said the customers were cheering the man on through his interview with police and had dubbed him a 'legend'. Despite the local man's popularity, officers are hoping to charge the man for his reckless behaviour. 'He hasn't been charged yet but we are trying to work out what the appropriate offence is because it's something bizarre,' Sergeant Mckenzie said.

'What he did was dangerous and could have endangered people.' However local officers have not entirely failed to see the humours side of the incident.

"After Hurricane Isaac made landfall over areas of Louisiana and Mississippi in 2012, emergency response vehicles emblazoned with the logo of the Red Cross rolled in. According to one former field supervisor, dozens of those vehicles had no destination and no supplies, useless for anything but providing the appearance of disaster relief. A joint investigation by ProPublica and NPR showed that in spite of massive funding, relief efforts from the American Red Cross were disastrous, forcing smaller organizations to step in. Arrival: A Red Cross vehicle distributes foodstuffs in January 2013 to Sandy victims in the Rockaways, months after critics blasted the organization, which raised over $300million during Sandy, for failing to aid victims . On the second anniversary of Sandy, the report states in the aftermath of the hurricanes, aid distribution was 'politically driven' and the Red Cross set aside resources for PR purposes. It also detailed the disastrous state of on-the-ground relief efforts, with volunteers wasting thousands of meals, and failing to track sex offenders or allowing them into children's play spaces. Richard Rieckenberg, 62, worked coordinating food and aid distribution as a 'mass care chief' for the Red Cross in both storms, and the empty trucks he saw deployed during Isaac made him 'furious.' Rieckenberg, who served as a Navy nuclear officer during the Cold War, detailed how one official dispatched 80 Red Cross vehicles with little to nothing in the way of food and supplies inside. Volunteers were told 'to drive around and look like you’re giving disaster relief' to bolster the image of on-the-ground aid to a visiting group of Red Cross executives, said Rieckenberg. Before the storm hit, Rieckenberg had issues with coordinating relief efforts with upper-level planners that were either poorly informed or more concerned with optics. Destruction: A resident wades through a Staten Island neighborhood where houses collapsed on themselves and roads became rivers . Chief executive: Representative Susan Brooks talks with American Red Cross CEO Gail McGovern, who is criticized for having an organization better suited for fundraising than relief . Abandoned: Homes throughout the mid-Atlantic region were torn apart by the force of Hurricane Sandy, forcing families into shelters run by the Red Cross and other organizations . In an email sent to Red Cross officials, he stated that '90% of incoming DRO [Disaster Relief Operation] staff were sent to Tampa Bay (over 460 mass care workers),' in spite of forecasts showing other areas of Florida would be harder hit. Rieckenberg now believes the motive was to give the organization significant visibility for the Republican National Convention, which was being held at the time in Tampa. His analysis of disaster relief provided in Mississippi was bleaker. There 'we were unable to open a single shelter with proper staff, materials and food resources prior to landfall,' he emailed national headquarters. 'We had trouble getting food to our kitchens.' He added that aid efforts were 'marked primarily by internal political wrangling, power struggles and ineffectiveness.' Though the organization promised reforms, an even more destructive disaster would hit about two months after Isaac. Two weeks after Sandy made landfall, Chief Executive Gail McGovern described the Red Cross's performance as 'near flawless' to NBC. For Rieckenberg, who was again coordinating aid efforts, the problems of Isaac had returned intensified in the wake of Sandy's massive destruction. In early November, officials noticed that ERVs, emergency response vehicles, both a symbol of Red Cross aid and a vital resource for disaster relief, were being diverted to press events. On November 2, as lines for food and water snaked through the Rockaways, Rieckenberg noted 15 of New York's active ERVs were working events tied to public relations for the Red Cross. Steve Ade, another mass care chief, emailed a vice president to complain that 'I can’t afford to have my ERVs sitting around all morning.' 'Stop right there,' came a response. 'These are not your ERVs. They belong to Gail [McGovern] and she’s going to do whatever she wants with them.' The Red Cross said 15 ERVs were delivering aid in Staten Island where Janet Napolitano, Homeland Security chief, was speaking, but that was 'not the reason that ERVs were sent to Staten Island.' Debris: Scenes like this one in Belle Harbor were replayed in numerous neighborhoods on the south shore of Queens and Long Island after Sandy struck . Photo Op: Heidi Klum posed with boxes in one Red Cross ERV leading one official to later grouse it took a 'Victoria's Secret model five hours to unload one box off a truck' In December, an ERV was tied up for a tour of storm-stricken areas of Long Island with supermodel Heidi Klum, angering aid workers. 'Did you know it takes a Victoria’s Secret model five hours to unload one box off a truck?' an official who requested anonymity said. 'I was so mad.' The Red Cross provided figures, saying it distributed 17 million meals and snacks, hosted 74,000 overnight stays at shelters and gave more than 7 million relief items like blankets and flashlights. A PowerPoint presentation claimed, though, the 'sheer size' of disaster relief areas left by Sandy 'crippled our ability to count.' It also showed how unprepared the volunteer force actually was. At Red Cross-run shelters, ill-prepared volunteers 'didn’t know/follow procedures' for handling of critical issues like sex offenders and infirm storm victims. The same PowerPoint, titled 'Lessons Learned from Sandy and Isaac' detailed volunteers sheltering sex offenders without tracking them or notifying police. 'Sex offenders were placed in a special place off of dorm, but they weren't there, they were all over, including playing in children's area,' the report detailed. After raising more than $300million in the wake of Sandy, Red Cross shelters lacked proper cots to accommodate handicap storm victims, who instead 'slept in their wheelchairs for days.' Sofía Gallisá Muriente had been working in one community in the Rockaways for weeks when the Red Cross finally arrived. She said that a volunteer arrived at her emergency center only to beg for batteries from Occupy Sandy, the group Muriente volunteered for, to put in flashlights it planned to distribute. Even where the Red Cross had supplies and funding, reporters found that excessive waste was being documented. In the face of news that Sandy victims were going hungry, in early November Red Cross officials began pressuring coordinators in New York to step up meal production. Rieckenberg, who was tracking meal delivery, estimated that 3 of every 10 meals produced was already being thrown away because volunteers were not finding those in need. The Red Cross overruled him, contracting a catering company to deliver 200,000 more meals per day over the 20,000 already being produced. The result, the day after the order was given, was a delivery of 70,000 danishes, half of which were discarded because volunteers were not given information about where hungry victims were. Because the catering company was also unable to produce lunch or dinner that day, volunteers were left with cold pastries to hand out for the remaining meals. Now, Rieckenberg states, after years of service, 'I don’t donate to the Red Cross.' As the Red Cross drew criticism in the early weeks after Sandy, the organization did respond, but Rieckenberg said the changes were only to make it 'look the best to the local politicians.' One town remembers the Red Cross as being a permanent absence. Bergen County in New Jersey opened their Emergency Operations Center, where officials met at all hours of the day to coordinate disaster relief in the wake of the storm. When the center was activated, explained police lieutenant Matthew Tiedemann, a chair was set aside for the Red Cross. It remained vacant through the entirety of Sandy response efforts. 'They were the only major player not there,' he said.","A joint investigation by ProPublica and NPR found the Red Cross often failed to plan and provide adequate relief in the aftermath of both disasters .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's Australian tour earlier this year cost Australian taxpayers a fraction of what it cost for the Queen to visit in 2011. Kate, William and Prince George's whirlwind 10-day trip around the country cost a total of $474,137 excluding security – less than one fifth of the $2,688,819 it cost for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh to make a similar trip. The majority of the money spent by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet ($251,338) was to cover transport costs, including for the RAAF to fly them from New Zealand to Australia and then interstate once they arrived, The Australian reported.

"Clara McKinty, 90, was left to sit on a plastic chair in A&E for more than eight hours after suffering a suspected stroke . A 90-year-old was left to sit on a plastic chair in A&E for more than eight hours after suffering a suspected stroke. Clara McKinty, known as Joan, was told it was a 'usual day' after her long wait to receive treatment at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. She was struggling to talk and complained to doctors of a pounding headache – both common stroke symptoms – but was not given priority. A stroke is a life-threatening medical emergency and urgent treatment is essential because the sooner a person receives treatment, the less damage is likely to happen. The 90-year-old arrived at 5.30pm, but she was not seen until seen by a doctor until 11pm. She then returned to her seat to wait until 2am and was placed on a trolley bed for the night until her diagnosis in the morning. 'I think it's disgusting and ridiculous. I got in there at 5.30pm and just sat, and sat, and sat,' she said. 'There were quite a few other people who were also waiting just as long as me, maybe even longer. 'But nobody came up to us to explain why it was taking so long. My son went up to the nurses four times, but they just said it was a 'usual' day. 'They said there were people the other side of the wall who were also waiting just as long. I was just relieved to be seen in the end.' Her son Kevin drove for an hour from his Swansea home to escort her to A&E after Mrs McKinty was told it would take three hours for an ambulance to pick her up and make a 30-minute journey. She was told it was a 'usual day' after her wait to receive treatment at University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff . She was given a brain scan the following morning and a consultant confirmed she had not suffered a stroke and was free to return home . Mr McKinty said an elderly potential stroke sufferer should not be left waiting in such conditions. 'Nobody offered communication or anything to eat or drink,' he said. 'I got the impression from nurses that this was an average night and just ""one of those things"" you put up with. 'To sit on a plastic chair for an hour or so is hard, but she was on one for more than eight.' She was given a brain scan the following morning and a consultant confirmed she had not suffered a stroke and was free to return home. New NHS guidelines say that 95 per cent of patients should be seen within four hours of arriving at A&E. A spokeswoman for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said: 'The Medical Assessment Unit can be extremely busy and we aim to treat all patients as soon as possible, with priority given to patients with the most urgent need. 'We are sorry to hear about the family's concerns and would urge them to contact us to discuss further.' Strokes occur when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. If you suspect that you or someone else is having a stroke, phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Face – the face may have dropped on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth or eye may have dropped. Arms – the person with suspected stroke may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm. Speech – their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake. Time – it is time to dial 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms.","Clara McKinty, 90, was told it was a 'usual' day after eight-hour wait at A&E .

"Regular selfie-takers may be more narcissistic than their photo-shy friends, according to a new study being conducted at the University of Georgia. Researchers working on the study are trying to determine whether some people’s constant desire to snap pictures of themselves suggests that they are more self-absorbed. Keith Campbell, a psychology professor at the University of Georgia leading the selfie study, told the Today show that previous research suggests three reasons people take selfies: 'self-absorption, a social connection and art.' Scroll down for video . Self love: Researchers at the University of Georgia are trying to determine whether selfie-takers, such as Kim Kardashian, are more narcissistic . He has called upon volunteers with a particular penchant for selfies to take one while in his lab so that he can study the effect that the image has on others. ‘We’re going to have people rate those selfies to see if we can detect narcissism from some of those selfies,’ he explained. And it’s not just narcissism that selfie takers need to worry about. Career experts are now saying that the rise in selfie taking could lead to the more regular snappers losing out on jobs. Picture perfect: Keith Campbell, a psychology professor at the University of Georgia leading the study, cited 'art' as another reason people snap selfies - calling to mind Lindsay Lohan's recent snap of herself with her Marilyn Monroe-inspired self-portrait hanging in the background . Popularity contest: Dr Campbell says 'social connection' is another popular reason for taking selfies, as might be the case in Ellen DeGeneres's crowded Oscar selfie . '[Employers may wonder] do you get the line between private versus public and might you share something about their company if you worked there that was inappropriate?' career coach Hallie Crawford recently told KMOV. 'In a career sense, it can really impact your brand.’ The news will no doubt come as a blow to prolific public selfie takers such as Kim Kardashian, Lindsay Lohan and Miley Cyrus, who are all famed for their seemingly non-stop stream of selfies. Dr Campbell, the author of The Narcissism Epidemic: Living in the Age of Entitlement, said he's interested in studying selfies because 'It's a form of communication with simple self-expression.' 'It's just something we've never seen before, at least at this massive scale,' he added.","A new study currently underway at the University of Georgia suggests fans of the self-portrait are more narcissistic .

"Holidays with your spouse are supposed to be relaxing. Unfortunately, these trips are all-too-often soured by arguments, especially during potentially dire long haul flights. New research suggests most Australians agree there is an easy step you can take to alleviate this problem: booking a stopover. A new study from  the Singapore Tourism Board found that stopovers can be a valuable way for couples to avoid conflict . Almost three million Australians have experienced a negative impact on their relationship after long flights (stock image) The study from the Singapore Tourism Board found that almost three million Australians have experienced a negative impact on their relationship after travelling on a flight for over 10 hours. Nearly half of all Australians featured in the study said the stopover would alleviate this effect. Dr Melissa Keogh, one of Australia's leading psychologists, told Daily Mail Australia 'having something to look forward to at the tail end of a holiday can be very helpful psychologically.' 'It breaks things up and allows you to keep a positive outlook. A trip after a long flight can be tainted by a long flight.' 'A stopover is one way for couples to break up their journey back home and thereby reduce the impact of conflict on their relationship. 'By doing so the holiday, which should be a happy and positive time, can remain just that as opposed to being overshadowed by other issues,' she said. The study found that nearly half of all Australians said the stopover would alleviate this effect . Jay Edmondson, 32, and Louise Heesom-Smith, 30, are an Australian couple who travel together several times a year, and say 'the pros of stopping over definitely outweigh the cons' 1. Try to keep the positive to negative ratio of comments at five to one. 2. If you're agitated, try to cool down before you says something confrontational. 3. Communicate clearly what you both want  out of the trip before hand. 4. If possible, spend some time apart during the trip where you do your own thing. 5. Stay well rested before and during the holiday. 6.  Plan the trip thoroughly. This will reduce stress and allow you more leisure time. 'Since planes are a confined space, there's nowhere to escape if you grow irritated.' Dr Keogh says our brains don't function as well on flights, which can give rise to anxiety and frustration. 'A stopover gives you something to look forward too, which keeps you optimistic. 'A good holiday is very underestimated for your psychological well-being. I've had patients with severe depression go on a great holiday, and they no longer require medication afterwards.' Jay Edmondson, 32, and Louise Heesom-Smith, 30,  are an Australian couple who travel together several times a year, and are adamant that stopovers are a wise idea. 'The pros of stopping over definitely outweigh the cons,' says Mr Edmondson. Dr Keogh says our brains don't function as well on flights, which can give rise to anxiety and frustration (stock image) 'Don't get me wrong, after our recent visit to London we were both ready to get home and unpack out suitcases, however had we not stopped over I don't think we would have looked back at our holiday with such positive memories.' 'We were both tired and irritable having been so busy in London that having a stopover meant we could relax and enjoy each others company before getting back into our daily routine.' 'Having that mini-break enabled us to continue our holiday for longer.'","New study found couples experience a negative impact after long flights .

"A self-styled lingerie model has been hit with an Asbo banning her from speaking to her neighbours for five years after a campaign of 999 calls and harassment. Tanya Pascolini, 42, was ordered not to talk to anyone who lives on her street in the village of Thames Ditton, Surrey, or face jail for breaching the order. Ms Pascolini was also told not knock on her neighbours' doors and windows or use 'abusive or threatening language and behaviour' outside her home. One neighbour said Tanya Pascolini, 42, as 'full-on' and always 'shouting the odds' at her Surrey neighbours . The Surrey woman, who claims on her Facebook page to work for lingerie chain Ann Summers, was also told to keep her dogs on a lead when outside. One local, who asked not to be named, said today: 'Tanya has lived here a few years now and is known for being a bit, how should I put it, full-on. 'I don't think she means anything bad, but she's always causing problems knocking on doors and shouting the odds at her neighbours.' She added: 'It is going to be nigh on impossible for her not to breach the Asbo unless she walks about with gaffer tape over her mouth. 'How can you go five years without speaking to any of your neighbours? It's impossible.' The Asbo was issued on October 30 and will run until the same date in October 2019. Ms Pascolini faces being arrested and jailed if she breaches any terms of the order. Tanya Pascolini claims on her Facebook page she works for the lingerie chain Ann Summers . Last year, a total of 1,349 ASBOs were issued - a 2% increase from the 1,329 the year before. The orders can be given out for any number of nuisances or offences from falling over while drunk and for being noisy neighbours. Last week, tenants who terrorise their neighbours by making them feel intimidated or causing lots of noise with endless parties were told they could be evicted in two weeks under a new fast-track process for landlords. New powers are being introduced by the Government which mean private and social landlords will be able to evict nightmare tenants more quickly, rather than leaving them in properties for months or even years while lengthy court proceedings take place. The fast-track process will work by allowing previous convictions for serious anti-social behaviour. This will include those who have taken part in riot-related offences, to trigger eviction proceedings. The powers are contained in the Anti Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, which gives landlords five ways in which they can apply to evict their tenants.","Tanya Pascolini told to phone emergency services only for 'genuine reasons'

"Greg Dyke took a public stand against Sepp Blatter on Tuesday, joining the chorus of calls for the FIFA president to resign and describing his accusation that the British media is racist as ‘offensive’. Dyke was one of only two leading football officials who challenged Blatter after the 78-year-old Swiss had delivered a speech to UEFA Congress here in Sao Paulo. Blatter sparked fresh controversy on Monday when he claimed allegations of corruption around the Qatar victory to host the 2022 World Cup was being driven by the ‘racism and discrimination’ of the ‘British media’. Eyes on the prize: Sepp Blatter on stage with Brazilian model Fernanda Lima at a FIFA gala on Tuesday evening . On stage: Lima - presenting at the FIFA Congress - alongside under-fire Blatter (right) Tough crowd: Blatter and Linda Barras attend the Opening Ceremony of the 64th FIFA Congress . Rolling out the red carpet: Blatter (arriving with Barras on Tuesday) has come under siege this week . Football Association chairman Dyke . said he found the remarks ‘completely unacceptable’ and stood up to the . FIFA president in an auditorium at the city’s Renaissance Hotel. ‘The . only reason I did it was because of what Mr Blatter said yesterday, . which I found, as I’m sure many of you found, offensive,’ he said. Dyke . shared his response to Blatter with the media. ‘I said: “Could I say . that I regard the comments you made yesterday about the allegations in . the British media in which you described them as racist as totally . unacceptable. I have read the articles in the Sunday Times in great . detail, and the allegations being made have nothing to do with racism. They are allegations about corruption within FIFA. ‘These . allegations need to be properly investigated and properly answered. We . need to know from Mr Garcia (Michael Garcia, the independent FIFA . investigator) tomorrow if he was aware of the material in the Sunday . Times before it was published and, if not, whether he will now extend . his investigation to consider these allegations. ‘Mr . Blatter, many of us are deeply troubled by your reaction to these . allegations. It’s time for FIFA to stop attacking the messenger and . instead consider and understand the message.’ Dyke . said Blatter did not react as he stood at a lectern on the stage. ‘He . said it would be addressed tomorrow in FIFA Congress,’ said Dyke. David . Gill, the former Manchester United chief executive and current member . of the UEFA executive committee, echoed Dyke in a press conference after . the European governing body’s meeting had finished. When Dyke was asked if Blatter should now stand for re-election next year, he replied: ‘Dave Gill has real concerns. Opposition:  Blatter addresses the room during a meeting of UEFA federations in Sao Paulo . Fury: Both FA chairman Greg Dyke and England's UEFA vice-president David Gill are unhappy with Blatter . ‘Obviously there would have to be a decision made by the FA board but I think that we all accept that four years ago he (Blatter) said he was only standing for one more term. ‘We were asked at a meeting fairly recently and our view was that among the British public there wasn’t any doubt that brand FIFA is severely damaged. And I suspect that’s the same throughout large parts of Europe. ‘I suspect there is a view within the FA that we would support that position (that Blatter should stand down) but we will decide that at the board, which is the proper place.’ Pressed for his personal view, Dyke then said: ‘It’s certainly Dave Gill’s view and we all accept that four years ago he said he would stay on for one more term and he should probably stick to that . ‘In these circumstances, when a third of the FIFA ExCo has already resigned due to corruption allegations, I think what you want … there have been serious allegations that need to be investigated. Should he stay or should he go? Blatter has indicated he plans to run for another term as FIFA president . ‘If they turn out to be true then it’s difficult for a chief executive figure to continue in most circumstances.’ It was a courageous stance for Dyke to take, particularly when Europe’s opposition could prove futile given the widespread global support Blatter has appeared to retain this week. There was no standing ovation at the end of UEFA Congress – indeed he needed the protection Sao Paulo’s Shock Battalion riot police to enter the UEFA hotel - but from continents like Africa and Asia that has been the reaction, and at the end of the day Europe have just 53 of the 209 votes for the president. Gill, also the vice-chairman of the FA, nevertheless backed Dyke. ‘That statement made by Mr Blatter was, from our perspective, totally unacceptable and factually incorrect,’ he said. ‘To attempt to portray it as a racial or discriminatory attack is totally unacceptable. ‘What is important is we test that information. We should be saying we’re not happy about it, what are we going to do about it and let’s investigate it fully. ‘We can’t have football being the number one game in the world , growing year by year, without having that responsibility around it.’ Time to go? Gill has urged FIFA president Blatter, 78, not to stand for a fifth term . Asked for his view on 78-year-old . Blatter’s decision to stand for a fifth term, Gill said: ‘I’m surprised. I think the very fact that in 2011 he was clear that it was for four . years, I  think that should have been the situation. ‘To see he has changed his mind is disappointing.’ Asked . whether Blatter should go, Gill then replied: ‘Personally, yes. I think . we need to move on. But that's just my personal opinion. There are 209 . countries voting for the new president. ‘But . if I was the chief executive and I had these allegations and these . concerns, I wouldn't look at them negatively and blame people for . bringing them forward. ‘I . think FIFA would benefit significantly from a change. If you look at . what happened at the IOC, the IOC is now a much more respected . organisation.’ Before Dyke stood up to challenge Blatter, Dutch federation president Michael van Praag tore into the under-fire FIFA president. Van . Praag might yet emerge as UEFA’s choice to stand against Blatter next . year and the fact that he is a FIFA ExCo member was certainly . significant. Way back: Gill with Blatter at the Champions League game between Man United and Inter Milan in 2009 . In the . behind-closed-doors UEFA Congress it is understood he told Blatter: ‘In . the last eight or nine years, FIFA has built an ugly reputation, not . only in the press but you only have to look at Twitter - #FIFA #Blatter . #FIFA Mafia. ‘There are . reasons – bribery, money and corruption are so often linked. FIFA has a . bad reputation. FIFA has an executive person and if you like it or not, . you have a responsibility.’ To . the media Van Praag then said: ‘I took the floor and I said that if you . look at the reputation FIFA has built over the last 7 to 8 years, with . accusations of corruption, bribery and all kinds of old-boy network . things, FIFA has an executive president and that means you are . responsible. ‘You don't make . it very easy on yourself because what you said on Qatar was the wrong . choice, which means you blame your executive committee. ‘All these problems occurred when you were president so I believe that you should not run anymore.’ Responding to Blatter’s accusations of racism, Van Praag said: ‘I was not happy because this has nothing to do with racism.’","Blatter claimed on Monday that racism was behind corruption allegations .

"The internet has allowed us to take a closer look at each others' lives in a way that has never before been possible. And now a new website has taken that ethos to an extreme, by providing a live feed of every single picture uploaded to photo-sharing service Instagram from five major cities. The effect could be chillingly invasive - but instead, the stream of colourful images combine into a beautiful art project. A snapshot of London: The site takes images uploaded from the capital and shows them as a giant photo mosaic . The site, called This Is Now, hosts Instagram feeds from New York, London, Sydney, Tokyo and Sao Paulo. Each of the five versions shows a non-stop stream of the pictures taken by users of the app in the relevant city. They use the geographical identification feature of Instagram to narrow down the appropriate pictures, only showing you picture from your chosen city. The . result is a unique window into the lives of some of the world's most . vibrant cities, described as a constantly changing portrait of how residents see . their world. London: This image shows what residents of the UK's capital were taking pictures of early on Friday morning . By Thursday night, 50,000 people had visited the site as it went viral. However, . notwithstanding the aesthetic appeal of the site, which was created by . Australian company Lexical Gap, some will surely have privacy concerns. Though . the site is only taking information previously submitted publicly to Instagram, . some users may not realise their photographs are so easily visible to . the whole world. Instagram fans may think they are only . sharing pictures with their friends, but by using the app they are . entrusting their personal information to a corporate giant - and . publishing it to the web. Sydney: Australians share an interest in fashion and the Olympics, according to the Instagram feed from This Is Now . The site also gives a fascinating insight int the activities of each cities residents -for instance, London's stream is filled to the brim with Olympic pictures at the moment, while Japanese residents seem to prefer self portraits. The Sydney firm behind the site described it as 'a visual composition which uses real-time updates from the ever popular Instagram application based on users geo-tag locations'. 'The tool streams photos instantly as soon as they are uploaded on Instagram and captures a cities movement, in a fluid story,' the firm said. It also promised that more cities are coming to the service soon. Tokyo: It must be lunchtime in Japan, as smartphone users eagerly upload photographs of tasty-looking meals . Instagram hit the headlines earlier this year when it was sold to Facebook for an astonishing $1 billion - although it has now emerged that Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom initially wanted $2billion for his start up. According to an article in The Wall Street Journal, the major acquisition was handled in a markedly start-up way, with Mr Zuckerberg calling Mr Systrom on April 5 and asking for a meeting. The two proceeded to spend 12-hour days ironing out the financial details not in a formal conference room of a corporate headquarters but in the comfort of Mr Zuckerberg’s $7million, five bedroom home in Palo Alto. The move was a risky one: Instagram has generated zero profit in its two years of existence, but the 27-year-old billionaire saw it as filled with potential because of the rate at which it has grown. Mr Zuckerberg raised the question of whether Facebook would eventually become a company like Google- which is valued at $200billion- or would it stick closer to the projections that place Facebook’s initial public offering valuation at $100billion. At the end of the three day negotiations, Mr Systrom agreed to a deal that amounts to roughly $1billion in Facebook stock. By day three, when they were about to sign off on the final details, the two men alerted their respective boards and investors. The troops rounded up quickly, and in the case of Facebook they held a vote. Sao Paulo: The beautiful people of Brazil happily share pictures of themselves - and their pets - while they are using Instagram . Despite of the seemingly democratic method, the vote was largely symbolic because Mr Zuckerberg has enough clout to make it go through with his voting shares even if he did not have their support. Mr Zuckerberg was clearly happy with his investment and, appropriately, he decided to share his satisfaction. ‘This is an important milestone for Facebook because it's the first time we've ever acquired a product and company with so many users,’ he wrote on his Facebook wall, referencing Instagram’s approximate 35 million users. ‘We don't plan on doing many more of these, if any at all. But providing the best photo sharing experience is one reason why so many people love Facebook and we knew it would be worth bringing these two companies together.’ A day after posting about the deal on Facebook, he took to Instagram, displaying a photo of his Hungarian Puli puppy Beast.

"CLICK HERE FOR ALL THE STATS AND FACTS FROM THE GROUP B FIXTURE WITH OUR MATCH ZONE SERVICE . The world champions are out. History. Kaput. Spain are gone. Tied first in departing this tournament, with Australia. Not in body, because there is still the matter of a meaningless final group game in Curitiba on Monday, but mathematically and in spirit. They trooped off the pitch in the Maracana Stadium last night, heads bowed, all resistance spent. After two games they have no points and a goal difference that reads 1-7.

And that was before they took a two . goal half-time lead against the world champions. Spain . had too much to lose, while Chile played like a team that could only be . heroes. The exclusion of Xavi and defender Gerard Pique – but, . fatefully, not goalkeeper Iker Casillas – spoke of the trauma suffered . in the five goal defeat to Holland. Chile’s players, by contrast, spent . the previous night socialising with friends and family at their . beachfront hotel in Barra. It showed. In the second minute Gonzalo Jara . headed an Alexis Sanchez corner just wide to roars of approval and the . pattern was set. Chile were not in the least intimidated by this . occasion. There were here to destroy some serious reputations. Dejected: Casillas prepares to walk back onto the pitch after a poor first 45 minutes . Argument? The under-fire keeper tries to reason with his disappointed team-mates . Out on their feet: The Spanish team looked tired in the second half, and were outrun against Chile . Play acting? Pedro is unhappy with the referee after Gonzalo Jara rolls on the floor . Sloppy: Fernando Torres came off the bench but failed to inspire once again . Incredible, . really, considering two of their starting line-up might have been . looking out for next season’s Championship fixtures earlier in the day, . to see who they would be playing on the first day of the new season. Jara of Nottingham Forest is at home to Blackpool, Gary Medel of Cardiff . City away at Blackburn Rovers. No wonder they played like men possessed . in the Maracana. What a moment, what an opportunity, what a possible . escape if they can grab the world’s attention here. They certainly did . that last night. Rugged, committed, but highly skilled in attack, Chile . matched Spain’s possession statistics in some periods of the match and . stretched a beleaguered back four to breaking point. Del . Bosque had brought in Javi Martinez, a holding midfield player by . nature, to the heart of defence, but he was hardly convincing. Alonso, . equally, was finding it hard to get to grips with Chile’s movement as a . defensive screen. Upfront, Spain fluffed their lines – none more so than . the apple of Jose Mourinho’s eye, Diego Costa. He . had a good chance in the 27th minute, put through by a headed flick . from David Silva, but buried the ball into the pitch and the . side-netting. Indeed, the only time Chile’s goalkeeper Claudio Bravo was . needed in the first-half was in the 15th minute when Spanish aggression . forced a goalmouth scramble and he fell on an Alonso shot from close . range, much like Superman smothering a grenade. Blow: The Spanish players leave the pitch after crashing out of the 2014 World Cup . Unsuccessful: Javi Martinez could not inspire a stronger defensive performance . Stopper: Claudio Bravo does well to keep out Santi Cazorla's late free-kick . Unhappy return: Costa snubbed playing for Brazil in favour of starting for Spain in his home country . It . was soon after this incident that Chile took the lead, by no means . against the run of play. Alonso lost the ball and a swift counter . attacking move saw Charles Aranguiz play a lovely square pass into the . path of Eduardo Vargas. He took a touch to control it and, at first, it . appeared as if the delay was costly. In fact, he was merely moving the . ball from his left to his right, and finished with a low shot that gave . Casillas no chance. In the . 44th minute, Chile went two clear. Sanchez curled in a free-kick which . Casillas should have taken, but chose to parry instead – the ball flying . tamely out to Aranguiz who swung a right foot and sent it on a return . path to goal. Goodbye: The Spanish press report on Spain's shock defeat (left) as a Spanish fan reacts at the final whistle . Form: Chile took another step closer to qualification after their impressive 2-0 win . The . second-half followed a predictable pattern, Koke on for Alonso and Spain . fighting for their lives. Even so, there was an excellent chance for . Mauricio Isla in the 69th minute, when he almost got a foot on a . crossfield shot by Eugenio Mena. For Spain, Costa missed another fine . chance, and then set an equally good one up for Sergio Busquets, with an . overhead kick, which was scuffed wide. We . all know what event the Maracana is waiting for but, until that day . arrives on July 13, it is hard to believe there will be bedlam louder . than the final whistle here. Chile had torn down the temple of . tiki-taka; or maybe Xavi Hernandez had just turned 34; or maybe a bit of . both. Pre-match buffet: A sneak peak inside the Spanish dressing room before the game .

"Wayne Rooney has hit out at claims he trained with England's back-up players during training on Monday, insisting he was just putting in extra work ahead of the do-or-die clash with Uruguay. As Sportsmail's Neil Ashton reported on Monday, rather than Rooney training with reserves as an indication of his selection for Thursday's match the Manchester United forward was doing an extra session.

Talking tactics: Rooney receives instructions from Roy Hodgson as England prepare for the Uruguay game . Rooney has never scored at a World Cup and missed a wonderful chance in Saturday's promising, if ultimately frustrating, 2-1 defeat to Italy in Manaus. The Manchester United forward stayed on for extra shooting practice after training on Monday, although he has hit back at suggestions it was down to desperation to prove himself to Roy Hodgson ahead of Thursday's match in Sao Paulo. 'Sometimes wonder what the press are getting at,' Rooney posted on his Facebook page. 'I said from the start I want to do everything I can to make sure I'm ready for these World Cup games and as part of that I was doing extra training a week before the squad joined up.

"Comedian John Cleese has blamed his troubled relationship with his late mother for his years of therapy and four marriages. The Monty Python star, who married his fourth wife Jennifer Wade in 2012, said his mother Muriel had 'utterly egotistical impulses' and that he lacked any affection for her during his childhood. Cleese, 74, also revealed in his new autobiography, So, Anyway, that he lost his virginity aged 25. Scroll down for video . Monty Python actor John Cleese says his fraught relationship with his mother 'dominated' his romantic liaisons . Cleese co-wrote Fawlty Towers with his first wife, Connie Booth, who he married in 1968. They had one child together, but had divorced by the time the second series aired. Cleese's second marriage, to Barbara Trentham, lasted nine years, with the couple remaining friends after their split in 1990. He then wed Alyce Eichelberger, a marriage he reportedly told close friend Michael Winner he regretted, but  nonetheless they stayed together for 16 years. Finally the Monty Python actor married Jennifer Wade, who is 31 years younger than him, in 2012. He told the Sunday Times magazine that his mother, who died at the age of 101 in 2000, 'dominated' his relationships, and that he had sought therapy because of his issues with women. 'It is said you shouldn't speak ill of the dead but it seems to me an ideal opportunity,' he said. 'I don't want to get too dark and depressing but she was emotionally difficult. She was a tyrant.' In an extract of his new autobiography, So, Anyway, published in the magazine, he wrote: 'It cannot be a coincidence that I spent such a large part of my life in some form of therapy and that the vast majority of the problems I was dealing with involved relationships with women. 'My ingrained habit of walking on eggshells when dealing with my mother dominated my romantic liaisons for many years.' Cleese had a child with each of his first two wives, Connie Booth (left) and Barbara Trentham (right) Cleese was married to Alyce Eichelberger (left) for 16 years, but has since married Jennifer Wade, who is 31 years his junior, at a ceremony in the Caribbean . Cleese's divorces took their toll on the comedian's finances too, with £12.5m reportedly paid out to Ms Eichelberger after their split. In 2011, Cleese embarked on his 'Alimony Tour', which he said would help pay the large settlement, which included £600,000 a year for seven years for his third wife. He is set to perform a number of theatre shows later this year following publication of his memoir on October 9. In the book, the Fawlty Towers actor also revealed he was almost 25 when he lost his virginity while touring New Zealand with the Cambridge Circus because 'girls just weren't around'. Meanwhile, despite the success of a string of sell-out comeback shows at London's 02 Arena in July, Cleese admitted he felt 'no trace of excitement' by the second show of their 10-night run. 'It was only our second night,' he said. 'I was waiting to start a sketch and a few seconds before the spotlight turned on me, I could see the huge packed arena and I felt no trace of excitement. 'If you're standing in front of 6,000 people and you're thinking ""this is perfectly pleasant but I'm not in the slightest bit excited"", then God, or possibly Richard Dawkins, is sending you a message that maybe you should be doing something else.'","Cleese says his fraught relationship with his mother 'dominated' marriages .

"Arsene Wenger is ready to give Joel Campbell the opportunity to establish himself at Arsenal. The Arsenal manager is here in Porto Alegre as a commentator for French television for Sunday evening’s game between France and Honduras. But Wenger confirmed that he planned to have the star of Costa Rica’s stunning defeat of Uruguay back in his Arsenal squad after sending the 21-year-old out on loan in 2011. VIDEO Scroll down for Costa Rica fans celebrate beating Uruguay 3-1 in Fortaleza . Stealing the show: Joel Campbell inspired Costa Rica to an impressive win over Uruguay on Saturday . Who's the daddy? Campbell celebrates after scoring Costa Rica's equaliser early in the second half . Bright future: Campbell looks set to be named in the Arsenal squad by Arsene Wenger for next season . ‘He will definitely come back to us for pre-season,’ Wenger told Sportsmail. ‘He is maturing well.’ Wenger missed the Costa Rica game because he was on a flight into Porto Alegre but on landing he received a message from former Chelsea manager Avram Grant, who is here in Brazil for Israeli TV and informed his friend and colleague how well Campbell was playing. Campbell scored once and created another as Costa Rica caused a major upset by beating Uruguay 3-1 in Fortaleza. Campbell signed for Arsenal three years ago but has spent the entire time out on loan, with Wenger feeling he was not ready for first team football at Arsenal. He sent him first to Lorient in France, then Real Betis in Spain and most recently to Greek champions Olympiacos, where he impressed against Manchester United in the Champions League. Curler: Campbell scored for Olympiacos against Manchester United in last season's Champions League . Kneesy does it: Campbell scored nine goals for the Greek side during his season-long loan spell . ‘Today was excellent for me but it would have come to nothing without the contribution of my colleagues,’ said Campbell after the game. ‘Everyone lived up to their responsibilities. I tried to do my best to score goals and my colleague supported me. ‘We have to take one step after another. We have difficult matches ahead but this will give us impetus.’ Wenger, meanwhile, was reluctant to give a lengthy interview - insisting with a smile that he was ‘not working’ - but he was happy to chat and he said he was thrilled by the quality of the football he had so far seen, stating that the tournament was of much higher quality than in South Africa four years ago. Of what he was able to see of the England game he said he thought Roy Hodgson’s team had played well. He also said he had not yet seen a bad game. What particularly impressed him, however, was the sheer athleticism of that astonishing header by Robin van Persie against Spain.

"Neymar laid down the gauntlet with two goals in Brazil's win on opening night. Now it's time for Lionel Messi to step forward and become the undisputed No 1 star of the 2014 World Cup, taking his place alongside Pele and Diego Maradona as an all-time great. It will be hard to escape the name of Maradona when Messi, 26, steps out into the Maracana to face  Bosnia and Herzegovina on Sunday. Step up: Lionel Messi will bid to emulate the World Cup triumph of Diego Maradona . Pele . World Cups 4 (1958, 1962, 1966, 1970)World Cup Wins 3 (1958, 1962, 1970)Games played 14Games won 12GoalsMaradona . World Cups 4 (1982, 1986, 1990, 1994)World Cup wins 1 (1986)World Cup runner-up 1 (1990)Games played 21Games Won 12Goals 8Messi . World Cups 2 (2006, 2010)World Cup wins 0Games played 8Games won 6Goals 1 . Maradona won the World Cup virtually single-handed for Argentina in 1986 and became the country's biggest idol since Eva Peron. Messi, who left his home town of Rosario for Barcelona at 13, does not receive the same adulation from fans who loved the passion and rags-to-riches story of Maradona, even though he has scored 38 goals in 86 caps since his debut in 2005. Named captain by coach Alex Sabella to try to inspire him to hit his best form, Messi sometimes speaks as if he is almost weighed down by talk of emulating 'El Diego'. Messi says: 'It is hard not to feel honoured when important people compare you with Maradona - he's the best there's ever been. My message, though, is please don't compare me with him yet. He won a World Cup for our nation, and until I've managed to do the same the comparisons are not something I welcome or accept. 'I know I have a responsibility, . especially as captain, to the people of Argentina but I try not to let . that pressure get to me. I approach every game - it doesn't matter if it . is a Champions League final or a World Cup game - as I did as a child … . and that is to have fun. On the ball: Lionel Messi dribbles the ball during a training session at Maracana stadium . 'I know the importance of the World Cup but if you approach games with a smile on your face and with the intention just to have fun on the field, then you often find things look after themselves.' It will please Messi enormously, given the pressure on his shoulders, that back in England, 1978 World Cup-winner Ossie Ardiles, who later became a team-mate and good friend of Maradona, thinks he has already proved himself as an all-time legend, regardless of what happens in Brazil. Ardiles never thought Maradona could be equalled, saying at the time: 'There is no point in anyone trying to be as good as him.' But he now thinks Messi deserves to be classified with Pele and Maradona among the greatest of all time. Relaxed: Messi clowns around with Pablo Zabaleta during a training session at Maracana stadium . 'He hasn't won a World Cup but look what he has achieved by the age of 26; Barcelona's all-time top scorer, three Champions Leagues, four times the World Player of the Year,' says Ardiles, now 61. 'He is already there in my opinion. If he wins the World Cup, he could be at a level all on his own! 'For me, it's a bit of myth that the people in Argentina don't love Messi. I think if anyone from Europe goes there, they will be amazed at the affection for him.' Ardiles won the World Cup on home soil, then secured a move to  'Tottingham' with pal Ricky Villa in one of the most stunning transfer deals of all time. Despite having to temporarily play his football elsewhere during the Falklands War in 1982, he stayed in England after retirement and still lives with his family in Hertfordshire. He hopes Argentina can win on enemy soil in Brazil - and believes they can. 'Argentina will have more supporters than any country except Brazil,' he says. 'And when people question the Argentina defence, I don't think it's as bad as people say. They only conceded 15 goals in 16 qualification games (second best behind Colombia) which is good for a very tough South American group. Glory: Diego Maradona lifts the World Cup trophy after Argentina won the 1986 World Cup . 'Argentina qualified for this World Cup easily compared to the last one when they brought in Diego Maradona as manager and only made it in the final game. They are all good signs and in my view, while Cristiano Ronaldo is a great player, Messi is better - the best in the world right now.' Argentina have the oldest squad in Brazil with an average age of nearly 29 and they brought  Manchester City defender Martin Demichelis, 33, in from the cold after he helped his club win the  Premier League. But to win the World Cup they need Messi at his best. He sometimes seems too modest, introverted and without enough of an ego to do what Maradona did. In the past 12 months, he lost his title of World Player of the Year to Ronaldo, and Barcelona lost La Liga. Former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson said in these pages last week this would be  Messi's last chance to dominate a World Cup. His style of leadership is to stay grounded and stress how difficult it will be for Argentina. 'There are about six or seven teams that will have a real belief they can win the World Cup,' adds Messi. 'Spain have set the standard in international football over the last six years. Brazil always step up, and playing in front of their fans will give them extra incentive.' Yet the fact Messi could shake the monkey of Maradona off his back offers all the incentive he needs.","Messi will seek to emulate Pele and Maradona .

"A graphic designer accused of poisoning her mother in a Breaking Bad-inspired murder plot fantasised about being Walter White or a 'Mexican drug warlord', a court has heard. Kuntal Patel allegedly became 'obsessed' with killing her mother Meena and bought deadly poison online after the 60-year-old 'forbade' her from marrying the man she loved. The 37-year-old, from Stratford, east London, contacted a dealer in the U.S through the 'dark web' and said she needed a 'tasteless' and deadly toxin to get her mother 'out of the way'. 'Plot': Kuntal Patel, 37, (left), from east London, is accused of trying to kill her mother Meena Patel, 60, (right) by lacing her Diet Coke with a deadly poison in a Breaking Bad-style plot . But, today, Breaking Bad-obsessed Patel told jurors it was all part of her 'fantasy' in which she imagined herself as a character in the American TV series. The series ends with teacher-turned-drug producer Walter White spiking a rival's drink with deadly ricin. Patel told Southwark Crown Court: 'It was like I saw myself to be some kind of Mexican drug warlord. I would think it through as if I was the main character in Breaking Bad. 'It was all a big mess. A complete and utter mess. 'I think in my mind, because I was living in my fantasy world, in my TV episode that I had created in my mind, I was just trying to find out what it would be like.' Patel, who worked for Barclays in Canary Wharf, is accused of trying to kill her mother by lacing her Diet Coke with a deadly toxin after the breakdown of her engagement to Niraj Kakad. During the second day of her evidence, the court heard how Patel had emailed the dealer after receiving the drug saying something had 'gone wrong' - because the 'target' was still alive. She wrote: 'Something has definitely gone wrong somewhere as it is now early Saturday morning and still everything is normal. 'Yes, target drank all of it. I made sure I watched her drink it all. I had to borrow money from friends to get this stuff from you because it's my last option. 'I can't be with the man I love because my mother doesn't like him. She is a bitter, miserable old woman and has been physically mean to me and my sister.' But speaking to the jury, Patel insisted the email was a 'fabrication'. Accused: Jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard how Patel (pictured in a court sketch) fantasised about being Walter White, the main character in Breaking Bad, or a Mexican warlord . She told the court how she initially ordered a batch of the deadly poison for £950 but 'panicked' and threw it away. But a few weeks later, the situation at home became too much for Patel to handle and she started having thoughts about killing herself and her mother again, she told jurors. The court had previously heard how her mother started beating her 'on and off' when she grew bitter about her daughter's new relationship with Niraj Kakad, whom she met online. Patel explained that she wanted more poison but did not want to pay for it. So she fabricated the story about feeding her mother the poison  so she could get another batch from the dealer for free, jurors heard. If he had known it was thrown away, the deal would have charged her another £950, she said. The prosecutor later labelled her version of events as 'one last roll of the dice' in an attempt to cover her tracks. She told jurors: 'I told him, I pretended that I had used it and I had watched my mother drink it. And I thought that by doing that it would pressurise him into sending another package. But she said emails sent to her dealer claiming she had poisoned her mother were a 'fabrication' 'I know how it appears, but the truth is I didn't do anything, it's all fabrication. 'It escalated and I had to go to work and pretend like everything was OK and I had to be at home and pretend everything was OK. 'But I was living this other life. This was my own way of coping - it was my coping mechanism. It was how I survived daily.' Wiping away tears from her eyes, she told the jury: 'I didn't do it, I didn't put anything in my mother's coke.' The court previously heard how Patel got poison sent to her hidden in a candle. It is alleged she slipped it to her mother's drink in December last year. But Patel claims she freaked out when she saw the candle and threw it away. Prosecutor Mr Polnay told the court that Patel was a 'liar' and not a fantasist and wanted her mother 'dead by Christmas'. He suggested she was buying the poison because she 'wanted it for murder'. But Patel replied: 'That's not true.' Mr Polnay continued: 'The truth is, to be with the man you loved you couldn't see any other way but to knock off your mum.' He added: 'I suggest this Breaking Bad fantasy is one last desperate roll of the dice. The last story after all the other lies had been uncovered.' But Patel insisted she was not lying in court, saying: 'The truth is, I could never hurt myself or my mother.' The former London Olympics volunteer said that when counter terrorism police raided her home in January she thought Jehovah's Witnesses were at her door. She was arrested and spent four days being questioned by officers at a police station. She told the court: 'I was told to quickly grab some clothing and leave the house. That was the last time I saw my mum and my sister. 'It was like a really bad dream. It just wasn't the real me. It was like me coming back to my senses and reality. 'It was a huge reality check, it was me coming back into the real world, real life, having to account for my actions.' In court, Patel admitted telling police 'a pack of lies' lying to police because she was terrified they would discover her email exchanges with the dealer. She said: 'I know I lied, I told many lies. The reason I lied was because I was frightened and scared. 'I didn't want the police to know what I had done in relation to the searches. I was terrified about what I had done in relation to the searches.' Peter Rowlands, defending, told jurors that, during a phonecall from Holloway Prison, Patel told her mother: 'I was going to kill you and Ambama saw that, that's why she is punishing me.' In the call, Patel added: 'I have done everything bad and dirty and goddess Ambama has seen what this girl is doing to her mum and so she has sent me here.' The Hindu goddess Ambama is said to punish bad acts. But Patel said she did not mean her 'confession' literally. She said: 'I meant that Ambama the goddess saw that I had these kind of thoughts against my mother. Not that I literally had done anything, which I had not.' Jurors heard how at work and at home Ms Patel was living one life, but in her mind was living a second 'secret life'. Role: Meena Patel is a  magistrate at Thames Magistrates' Court in Bow, east London . She claimed that like every other girl she wanted her mother at her wedding, and could never kill herself or her mother. She also confessed to hating the magistrate for scuppering her chances of love. Jurors have been read a series of messages exchanged between Patel and two of her friends, Julie Wong and Darcia Babb, in which Patel expressed her desire for her mother's death. In one she wrote: 'I am stuck with that miserable f*** until she dies.' She admitted to the court that she felt her mother was responsible in part for a 'roadblock' ruining her one shot chance of getting married, having a family, moving out of Stratford and 'living happily ever after'. Jurors heard Patel also allegedly looked on Google for how to find a hit man in Mumbai. Her mother had travelled to the Indian city for a court case. The court previously heard how she combed poison websites and Googled 'How to murder someone and get away with it' after being 'obsessed' with thoughts about killing her mother and taking her own life. Patel told jurors she would watch stay up all night watching and taking notes on Breaking Bad, later planning to buy a poison. She also became fixated with taking her own life and spent hours scouring suicide websites, the court was told. Ms Patel admits two counts of attempting to acquire a biological agent or toxin, but denies attempted murder and a further charge of acquiring a biological agent or toxin. The trial continues.

"X Factor may be a singing competition but whether they like it or not, the contestants are also judged on what they're wearing. But they don't just throw on any old thing before they take to the stage; their whole look is carefully constructed with the help of a team of experts who work like a well oiled machine backstage. Heading up the style squad is Gemma Sheppard, who has worked with the likes of Dannii Minogue, and helps curate each and every look for the live shows. FEMAIL were keen to find out the entire dressing process, who her favourite judge is and how she copes with Simon Cowell's criticism so we grilled the stylist on all things X Factor. Criticism: Lola Saunders' outfit came under fire this week after Simon Cowell said she looked like she was 'wrapped up in tape' - so how does her stylist feel about that? FEMAIL grilled her on all things X Factor . On Saturday night's episode, Simon ticked off Cheryl Fernandez-Versini with his critique of her wildcard Lola Saunders, who took to the stage and performed Sam Smith's Stay With Me. 'I really don’t like what you’re wearing,' he frankly said afterwards. 'I'm gob-smacked. You just look like you're wrapped up in tape. It’s important that you dress how you want to and not how somebody else tells you to in order to become the artist you want to be.' Style statement: Gemma Sheppard, the show's lead stylist, hit back at Simon saying that Lola looked 'spectacular' for her performance. Talk to the hand: Simon Cowell and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini clashed over X Factor contestant Lola Saunders on Saturday night's episode of the show . So how does Gemma handle Simon's comments? 'The creative brief for Lola was a dramatic production to support her big song,' she told MailOnline. 'For her styling it was a case of fashion meets costume, the red dupioni silk gown with that 12ft train looked spectacular as she moved to centre stage, that was the money shot! I believe that statement dress empowered Lola for her performance. 'Criticism is part of the show, this is a contest, and I'm willing to take on board all the comments.

Muse: Gemma loves working with Chloe Jasmine and describes her as 'enchanting like a modern day Marilyn Monroe with her platinum hair and ‎rouge lips' Style guru: Gemma has worked with Dannii Minogue in the past and is honoured to be styling this year's X Factor contestants . Gemma believes that fashion is an 'emotional tool' and if you look good, you feel good. 'It's all about confidence and getting inside of the contestant's heads,' she said. 'It is their closest moment to becoming a pop star so I want that to be translated in what they're wearing.' She couldn't be happier with the group, who make her job all the more enjoyable. 'The contestants really are an amazing group, all very polite and from the beginning we have set a mutual understanding and respect.' Despite public opinion, she doesn't believe that Chloe Jasmine is a diva, instead explaining: 'It's absolutely true what the judges say about Chloe, she is enchanting and lofts about the studios like a modern day Marilyn Monroe with her platinum hair and ‎rouge lips. 'She is like my muse. On Saturday night she dazzled in a Quiz dress I customised for her. Inspired by the drawings Robert Cavalli did for Katy Perry, we cut the neck line into a deeper V, added mesh with beadwork and two petticoat layers to create the flapper vibe ‎she pulls off so well.' As well as the contestants, Gemma works closely with the judges to discuss how they think their acts should dress for the live shows and she hugely admires both Cheryl and Mel's style. She said: 'The girls are gorgeous, they ooze glamour and go for the less is more look with block colours and clean lines. 'Mel's make-up is exquisite but I simply couldn't choose between the two as they're both equally distinctive and stunning.'

Colin Kaepernick (pictured) will earn £240,000-a-week - only Rooney and Van Persie are paid more in the Premier League . 1) Wayne Rooney (Manchester United) - Reported weekly wage of £300,000 . 2) Robin Van Persie (Manchester United) - Reported weekly wage of £250,000 . 3) Yaya Toure (Manchester City) - Reported weekly wage of £230,000 . 4) Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) - Reported weekly wage of £220,000 . =4) Luis Suarez (Liverpool) - Reported weekly wage of £220,000 . Kaepernick will rake in £240,000-a-week in his new contract and, when this is compared to the salaries of the Premier League's top earner, only Wayne Rooney (£300,000-a-week) and Robin Van Persie (£250,000-a-week) take home more. Kaepernick's new deal includes more than £34m in guaranteed money, a person with knowledge of the contract said, speaking on condition of anonymity because terms weren't disclosed. The sides had made it a top priority to get a deal done before the start of pre-season training next month. 'They were able to get it done six weeks earlier than what I think everyone thought,' Kaepernick said. Money: He will get £240,000 a week - 125 times what he was earning before the six-year extension . 'I'm very excited to have it done at this point and we don't have to worry about talks or anything like that moving forward. 'I'm always striving to be in that group. An elite group in the NFL. Not necessarily pay, but as far as a player. Whatever comes along with that comes along with it. 'I'm very grateful for it. ... I don't think my motivation is money-driven.' Kapernick was a second round draft pick out of Nevada in 2011, but he quickly took over the starting berth from Alex Smith, leading the 49ers to their first Super Bowl in 18 years after the 2012 season - a match they lost to Baltimore by three points. He then guided them to the NFC championship game last season - and another a three-point defeat, this time to 49ers' rivals and eventual Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks. Going for the ring: Kaepernick's main goal in the coming years is to go to as many Super Bowls as he can . After signing the contract, Kaepernick declared: '(My next mission is) trying to win as many Super Bowls as I can.' Kaepernick has completed 382 of 639 passes for 5,046 yards and 31 touchdowns. He has also started all six post-season games in which he has appeared, earning four wins and passing for 1,374 yards and seven touchdowns.

"Virginia state Senator Creigh Deeds has come forward to reveal his final moments with his son Gus, nearly a year after the mentally-ill young man tried to kill him in a knife attack. On November 18, 2013 Deeds obtained an emergency custody order to admit his suicidal son to a psychiatric ward, but that order expired before they could find him a bed at any hospital . The following morning, Deeds was feeding his horses when his 21-year-old son approached and suddenly started stabbing him with a knife. Deeds, now 56, says his last words to Gus were 'I love you so much' and that after uttering the statement, Gus let up and he was able to make his escape. Happier times: Creigh Deeds (right) was nearly killed by his bi-polar son Gus (left) last year in a violent attack that ended with his son committing suicide. Pictured with his musically-talented son on the campaign trail during his failed gubernatorial run . Turned away: Gus was attacked by his son after failing to commit him to a hospital the night before. Deeds took out an emergency custody order for his son, but couldn't find a bed for his son in a psychiatric ward. Pictured above in October speaking at a mental health symposium in Richmond, Virginia . Deeds ran away from the house where he was rescued and taken to the hospital. Police later found Gus dead from a self-inflicted gun shot wound. His daughter Susannah and second wife Siobahn believe it was those words of compassion that saved Deeds' life. 'I like to believe what Susannah said - that when I said ""I love you,"" that broke through,' Deeds told the Washington Post. 'That he was still delusional, but that did break through, and the old Gus heard that. Not the old Gus — Gus. That those things that had taken over Gus were defeated.' Still, Deeds admits he may never know the real truth behind his son's  motivations that day and he's still haunted by what he could have done differently to prevent Gus' suicide. Gus first started showing signs of mental illness after his first year at the College of William and Mary, when he got dumped by a girlfriend after visiting her in her native Colombia. But he continued to do well in school, making the Dean's List. He took the fall of his junior year off to help on his dad's gubernatorial campaign. When that campaign failed, and his parent's broke up, Gus went on a cross-country road trip, writing bad checks along the way and getting baptized in Oregon. Scene: Deeds was attacked the morning of November 19, 2013. He escaped after telling his son how much he loved him, and ran to the main road where he was rescued by a neighbor and taken to the hospital. He suffered 10 stab wounds in the attack . His father found the trip strange, but figured it wasn't altogether unusual for a young person. Gus' parents became more concerned when he took of another semester in the spring of 2010 to work in Gary, Indiana.  His mother took him for a psychological evaluation and Gus was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. However, doctors were optimistic and believed he wouldn't need to be medicated his whole life. 'I believed in Gus,' Deeds said. 'I believed he would snap out of it.' 'I’m not sure I’ve met anybody like him,' Deeds remembers. 'He was all the things I wanted to be. I’m not smart, not good at anything, not coordinated, can’t sing, no musical-instrument ability, no gift for languages, and he had all that. I don’t have any of the confidence he displayed at every moment.' But Gus didn't get better, and eventually started talking about suicide with his dad. 'He’d say, ""I just feel like I’m going to end it,""' Deeds said. 'He’d say, ""Dad, I feel like I want to die.""' While Gus had supported his dad on previous occasions when he was committed to a hospital, Deeds could tell something had changed the night before the stabbing when he took out an emergency order again. Father and son: Gus Deeds started showing signs of mental illness after his first year at the College of William and Mary. Pictured above with his dad in 2010 . At the hospital, where Deeds failed to find his son a bed, Gus paced back and forth. And in the car ride home, he was completely silent. 'I know he felt I betrayed him when I went and got the order,' Deeds says. 'I don’t feel I had a choice. I did what I did to try to save him.' Deeds' wife told him to leave the house for the night, but Deeds decided he wanted to stay with his son. However, for the first time ever, he locked his bedroom door at night and even heard Gus rattling the door knob trying to get in. Still, Deeds never thought his son would actually kill him. The next morning, Deeds got up to shower before Gus woke up and started his day as usual, feeding the horses. When he saw his son approaching, Deeds asked him how he slept and Gus responded 'fine'. 'I turned my back and... had this feed thing in my hands and he was just on me... He got me twice,' Deeds recalled in a 60 Minutes interview earlier this year. Deeds doesn't remember much from the frenzied attack, in which he suffered 10 stab wounds all over his body. Life's work: Deeds is still a state senator, and has made mental health care reform his top priority, Pictured above last March speaking about mental health reform at the National Press Club in Washington DC . Shortly after telling his son how much he loved him, Gus eased up. Deeds still isn't certain that those words impacted his son. 'Maybe he figured he did the damage he needed to do to kill me,' he said. 'Maybe he’d seen enough blood.' Either way, Deeds escaped and ran down to the road where he was found by a neighbor and taken to the hospital. His son returned to the house and shot himself dead with a gun Deeds never feared he would use since he couldn't find ammunition to buy for it. He's still not sure how Gus was able to source the hard-to-find bullets. Still a state senator, Deeds has now made mental health reform his top priority, and has already extended the window of emergency custody orders from six hours to 12.","The Virginia state senator's son Gus attacked him with a knife on November 19, 2013, hours after he tried to get him committed to a psychiatric ward .

"A married high school teacher has announced that he no longer wants to be identified as male and is beginning the transition to become female. Robert Konrad, a social studies teacher at Mitchell High School in Pasco County, Florida, plans to present himself as female by August 2015, principal Jim Michaels said in an email to parents. 'As you can imagine, this is a very private decision, but Mr. Konrad has indicated that he will respond to appropriate questions you may have about the transition process,' he said, the Tampa Bay Times reported. Konrad has worked at the school since 2010. His wife, Jericho Konrad, also works at the school and teaches reading, school records show. They have a two-year-old daughter together. By his side: A Pasco County school teacher, Robert Konrad, left and right, has announced that he is beginning the transition to female. His wife Jericho, right, is also a teacher and supports his decision, students said . Michael Nguyen, a student of Konrad's wife, said she had been supportive of her husband's decision. 'She said about how she supports him and how they are doing,' Nguyen told WFLA. Pasco County School District spokeswoman Linda Cobbe told the Times that the decision to release information to parents, staff and students was Konrad's and has the full support of the district. He did not want to hear rumors when he started changing his appearance, staff said. 'We don't think the person's gender or the person changing their gender affects their ability to teach,' she told the Pasco Tribune. As well as sending the email and making automated voice calls to parents, Michaels made the announcement during a staff meeting and spoke to students in Konrad's classroom. Together: Mr Konrad has worked at Mitchell High School since 2010 and is well-regarded by students, who expressed their support for his decision to come out about his transition . The couple, who work together at Mitchell High School . 'From what I have heard, the students are very supportive,' said Betsy Kuhn, the school district's director of employee relations. The announcement was met with surprise but support from former and current students. 'It's great for him to feel comfortable enough to come out,' Kerry Archbold, a former student, told the Tampa Bay Times. 'Now he's just Mrs. Konrad instead of Mr. Konrad.' Taylor Hanlon, a current student, added to WFLA: 'I think there are a few against it but there are a lot of it that are for  it and happy for him.' Others expressed their support for the teacher on social media, with one football player writing on Twitter that if students didn't like the decision it was 'too bad' - and they could go to another school. School district staff worked with Konrad, who told the principal of his decision at the start of the school year, through every step of the process, Kuhn said. They could not find any precedent where a school district had handled a similar situation so instead they consulted with private companies that had guides on how to deal with gender transition. Workplace: The Pasco County School District completely supports Konrad's decision but struggled to find guidelines on how to share the decision with students and parents, so consulted a private company . 'There was nothing on point to students,' she said. 'We tried to tailor a plan to what would work for education and in Pasco.' Some parents have expressed concern, fearing that there will be disruptions in the classroom because students could be distracted by the teacher and unable to concentrate on the lessons. 'Teachers are supposed to be role models,' said Wendy Howard, a school choice activist who does not have kids at the school. 'They're supposed to leave their personal lives out of the classroom.' Konrad, who identifies as Cosette on social media, declined to be interviewed but expressed thanks on Facebook, saying: 'Thank you to everyone for kind words.' Speaking to WFLA, he said he would possibly speak out in the future if it would be beneficial to students who find themselves in a similar situation.","Robert Konrad will present himself as a female by August 2015, an email to parents of children at Mitchell High School in Pasco County said .

"An 80-year-old man has been found guilty of storing 38 dead cats in his freezer because he wanted 'their spirits to be with him forever'. When animal welfare inspectors turned up at Donald Cruickshank's Auckland home, in New Zealand, in 2010, they were horrified by the disgusting conditions they came face to face with. Masses of dead felines covered in bloodied newspaper and bags were discovered stored next to the pensioner's food in his freezer, the New Zealand Herald reports. Donald Cruickshank stored 38 dead cats in his freezer at his Auckland home in New Zealand . Meanwhile, the stench of faeces from 19 living cats running around his lounge and bedroom overpowered officers. The SPCA found 17 more cats locked in cages and another 23 were housed in squalid conditions in the man's locked apartment below. In total there were around 50 cats in his home, besides the 38 dead ones in his freezer. Cruickshank was charged with failing to care for his pets and was sentenced in the Auckland District Court on Friday by Judge Russell Collins. The grey-haired cat hoarder was handed 40 hours of community work and a $100 fine. Although he won't be able to own any more cats, he has been allowed to keep the three he currently owns with the condition that SPCA officers will continue to monitor their welfare.

"Julia Pierson, the first woman to helm the U.S. Secret Service, resigned on Wednesday following two embarrassing episodes over just three days that underscored the once-respected agency's struggle to protect the president and the White House. A bitter Pierson gave an exit interview in which she claimed resigning with her agency in tatters was 'the noble thing to do,' and blamed news outlets for the quick collapse of her job. 'The media has made it clear that this is what they expected,' she told Bloomberg News. Pierson faced a hostile panel of lawmakers on Tuesday who demanded a better showing from the nation's top bodyguards after a mentally ill veteran scaled the White House fence on Sept. 19 and scampered more than 100 feet into the building, with a knife in his pocket, before agents tackled him. 'It's unacceptable,' Pierson conceded, but even President Obama's allies would hear none of it. 'I wish to God you protected the White House like you protected your reputation here today,' Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch barked at her. Hot seat: Julia Pierson absorbed endless flak from Republicans and Democrats alike on Tuesday during a contentious Capitol Hill hearing . Guarded: Pierson had her own personal protection detail when she arrived to testify before Congress on Tuesday . Shortly after the hearing, news emerged that on Sept. 16 an armed private security guard was allowed on an elevator with President Obama during his visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. His Secret Service detail wasn't aware the man was carrying a gun. Julia Pierson told Bloomberg News that her ouster was in part driven by news outlets' demands for her head. 'The media has made it clear that this is what they expected,' she said, since 'Congress has lost confidence in my ability to run the agency.' But she concluded that 'it’s in the best interest of the Secret Service and the American public if I step down.' 'I can be pretty stoic about it, but not really,' the spurned forner Secret Service chief told Bloomberg. 'It's painful to leave as the agency is reeling from a significant security breach.' Pierson said she spoke to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson 'in person' at his office, and 'and after that discussion I felt this was the noble thing to do.' Her resignation, she added, will 'take pressure off the organization.' 'In any organization, people are going to make a mistake,' she added, talking about the specialized bodyguard service that protects the lives of presidents and their families. 'But it’s important for the public to know that this organization is going to maintain a high degree of standards.' Calls for Pierson's ouster began to filter out to reporters within hours, beginning with Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, who walked back that demand on Wednesday morning. By then, however, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi had jumped on a moving train and said Pierson should step down. Several other members of Congress, mostly in the Senate, had insisted on the formation of a blue-ribbon panel to probe the Secret Service's lapses. Those demands are not likely to quiet down even after Pierson's replacement is chosen. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee – the site of Tuesday's legislative bloodbath – said Wednesday that the resignation 'does not resolve' all the Secret Services's problems, some of which 'pre-date Ms. Pierson’s tenure as director.' 'Yesterday, the Committee called for an outside review by independent experts,' he said. 'Today, Homeland Security Jeh Johnson today agreed that such a review is critical.' Pierson told Bloomberg that it was 'in the best interest of the Secret Service and the American public if I step down. Congress has lost confidence in my ability to run the agency. The media has made it clear that this is what they expected.' 'I can be pretty stoic about it, but not really,' she said. 'It's painful to leave as the agency is reeling from a significant security breach.' That breach outraged Sen. Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat who chairs the Homeland Security Committee in the upper chamber of Congress. He said an 'obvious dissonance that exists within an agency' was apparent because it could 'secure an event with over 100 world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City for nearly three weeks without apparent incident, but simultaneously fail to keep an intruder from running into the White House.' Obama appointed Pierson last year as pushback against perceptions that the service was becoming a boys'club. About 90 per cent of the 3,500 agents are male, and some of them were caught engaging prostitutes during an advance trip before Obama's 2012 trip to the South American nation of Colombia. Having a woman at the helm was thought to be a salve for the agency's suddenly scandalized public image. A veteran with PTSD scaled a White House fence on Sept. 19 and made it 168 feet into the presidential mansion before an off-duty agent happened to see him and brought him to the ground . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday that the president and his inner circle were unaware of the elevator lapse at the CDC until 'just minutes' before the Washington Examiner broke the story Tuesday afternoon. Earnest wouldn’t say whether Pierson herself told Obama, or the White House learned of it from the media. But 'my only knowledge of this is based on public reports,' Earnest admitted. Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz claimed in an interview with The Washington Post that the man on the elevator was a convicted felon, but a Secret Service source later told the Fox News Channel that he was never prosecuted following an arrest for Assault and Battery. 'You have a convicted felon within arm's reach of the president and they never did a background check,' an angry Chaffetz said. 'Words aren't strong enough for the outrage I feel for the safety of the president and his family.' 'His life was in danger. This country would be a different world today if he had pulled out his gun.' The man, a private security guard, was stopped for questioning because he refused to stop taking a cell-phone video of the Obama during the elevator ride. His supervisors suspended him on the spot and demanded he turn over his firearm – shocking Secret Service agents who weren't aware he was armed. Better days: Obama had high praise for the first female Secret Service director when he appointed her less than 18 months ago . Jumper: Omar J. Gonzalez pleaded 'not guilty' Wednesday in federal court, despite video footage of him scaling the White House fence and eluding Secret Service as heran into the president's executive mansion while carrying a knife in his pocket . Earnest said Pierson met Wednesday with Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, who 'accepted her resignation, which she offered because it 'was in the 'best interest of the agency.' ‘The secretary agreed with that assessment. The president did as well,’ Earnest said. ‘The president concluded that new leadership of that agency was required.’ But he wouldn't directly comment on the scandal unfolding over the elevator incident. Having an armed man in an elevator with the President of the United States was a 'serious breach,' and ‘unwise and unacceptable,’ he said, but he said further comment would have to wait until after an investigation is completed. 'The president has nothing but the highest regard for the men and women of the Secret Service,' Earnest told reporters. Earnest also wouldn't say whether or not other heads would roll. But after the Homeland Security Department conducts its own probe, he said, 'the president believes that an independent panel should review the results of this assessment ... to determine what steps are appropriate moving forward.' In a statement, Johnson said: ''I salute her 30 years of distinguished service to the Secret Service and the nation.' Pierson told Bloomberg of her resignation that she had 'met in person' with Johnson, 'and after that discussion I felt this was the noble thing to do' because it would 'take pressure off the organization.' Earnest said there is no immediate timetable for Pierson's permanent replacement, which will require Senate confirmation. And in this corner ... Pierson (center) shook hands with House Oversight Committee chairman Republican Darrell Issa before her dressing-down, as ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings looked on; he would later call for her ouster and then withdraw the demand just hours before Pierson resigned . Joe Clancy, a retired Special Agent, is 'a good candidate for serving as acting director until a more permanent replacement can be found,' Earnest said. He also revealed that Clancy is taking a 'leave of absence from his private sector job' to run the Secret Service in the interim. 'The president is grateful that he has taken on that very significant responsibility,' Earnest told reporters. Pierson studied criminal justice at the University of Central Florida and served for three years with the Orlando Police Department. She was among the first female officers assigned to a beat on that force. She served on the Presidential Protective Detail for President George H.W. Bush, and was put in charge of overseeing protective details for presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Moving her up the chain of command made sense on paper in April 2013: Pierson was already serving as chief of staff to then-director Mark Sullivan. Her working life started in a less-serious way, however. As a teenager in Orlando, she worked at nearby Disney World as a parking lot attendant – and even did a stint in the theme park as a costumed character in parades. Pierson was still listed on the Secret Service's website as the agency's director as of 3:45 p.m. Wednesday.","September 19 fence-jumper got deep inside the White House despite heavy security surrounding the building, and entered through an unlocked door .

"Losing your opening game at a World Cup is a blow and Saturday night’s defeat leaves England’s hopes of progressing hanging in the balance. But I honestly think there are more positives than negatives to take from the game, with Roy Hodgson’s gamble on Raheem Sterling - and the teenager’s fearless performance - both reasons to be optimistic. I say this with my professional head on and as an England fan, and I’d be surprised if a lot of my fellow England fans disagreed. Sure, I would have liked us to win, and we came closer than many may have expected. But Sterling, still 19 and in an England senior shirt for just a fifth time, was a breath of fresh air, attacking without fear, taking people on, going for goal, playing like he’s enjoying trying to win. Reason to be cheerful: Raheem Sterling was superb against Italy, here taking on Andrea Pirlo . Gamble paid off: Sterling was a breath of fresh air and attacked Italy at every opportunity . His pass to Wayne Rooney that Rooney then crossed superbly to Daniel Sturridge for 1-1 was a peach. And his early shot on goal from distance that rippled the side netting rather than ending up in the back of the net was the kind of effort that makes you get out of your seat. Danny Welbeck was lively too, although perhaps slightly more cautious. Rooney, as I’ve said a number of times, should be playing in his preferred position. But given that he’s not, he still laid on England’s goal. The downside was the way England conceded two goals. The first was a training ground move, executed beautifully. Claudio Marchisio’s shot - after Andrea Pirlo’s insouciant dummy - went through legs and Joe Hart had no chance. But as with the second goal, when Mario Balotelli met Antonio Candreva’s cross, being completely switched on to all the possibilities of Italy’s options would have limited them. Lively: Danny Welbeck was good, if more cautious than the rampaging Sterling . The upshot is that in football your most important game is always the next one — and after Saturday night, for England that now means Uruguay in Sao Paulo on Thursday. There couldn’t be more at stake. England are capable of winning but there will be some major psychology at play because of Luis Suarez and his closeness to his Liverpool team-mates. I’ve been there and done that in terms of playing against a club-mate in a massively important World Cup match, never more so than in the 2006 quarter-final against Portugal. Alongside me in the England line-up that evening in Gelsenkirchen was fellow Manchester United player Rooney — and we were up against United’s Cristiano Ronaldo. We all know how that ended, with a draw and the heartbreak of penalties, again, for England. Ronaldo winked after Wazza was sent off. There were all sorts of suggestions that they hated each other, to the extent that when we all got back to United training we handed them both boxing gloves! They didn’t need them, they were fine. But it highlights the special tensions at play. On the one hand, there’s comfort in it because you know everything about them — their capabilities, moods and motivation. Team-mates: Steven Gerrard consoles Luis Suarez following the draw against Crystal Palace . Best of enemies: Gerrard must not show Suarez (right) any mercy when England face Uruguay . All smiles: Gerrard and Suarez celebrate the Englishman's goal against Sunderland in March . Double-edged sword: Gerrard and Suarez will know everything about each other . But there’s also a negative that falls somewhere between respect and fear, because they know you so well too, what you can do, and especially your weaknesses. So assuming Suarez is up against Stevie Gerrard and Jordan Henderson in England’s two-man defensive cover shield, he will already be armed with all the knowledge of how to take advantage. I’m certain there will have been no contact between England’s Liverpool players and Suarez in Brazil. You need a clinical emotional detachment at times like this, no hint of club camaraderie. On the pitch you are enemies with just one focus: winning. If this sounds extreme then it goes further. I was mates with Frank Lampard as we came through the West Ham youth system together in the nineties. We spent a lot of time together, were close friends, had all that shared experience. Special tension: Wayne Rooney (centre) and Cristiano Ronaldo (right) after the Englishman's sending off in 2006 . Change in relationship: Rio Ferdinand (right) and Frank Lampard grew apart after the defender's move to Leeds . But when I moved to Leeds in 2000 and he went to Chelsea not long afterwards, we grew apart. And it wasn’t organic, it was a deliberate mutual shedding of a friendship because that closeness is simply not compatible with our jobs. At the highest levels of sport there is an intensity and professionalism that means you don’t want to give any opponent any edge whatsoever, no insight into your thinking or your behaviour. And that’s why for the duration of this World Cup and for the Uruguay game, Suarez’s Liverpool team-mates will be blanking him emotionally as they do their job. The most obvious area for England to exploit is the heart of Uruguay’s defence. The 33-year-old captain Diego Lugano has 95 caps and is a decent player. But he spent last season with a mediocre West Brom side and is now unattached. England’s forwards will be licking their lips at the opportunity to test him.

"England captain Steven Gerrard is at the centre of the escalating row between Nike and adidas over the leisure kit being worn by the players in Brazil. Adidas are taking action over the way Nike have been allowed by the FA to deck the England squad in their gear with little or no FA branding, in addition to the official supply items for on and off the pitch. This has meant Gerrard and the other adidas ambassadors in the England camp - Leighton Baines, Gary Cahill, Luke Shaw, Phil Jagielka, Frank Lampard and Ricky Lambert - being photographed with only Nike logos visible, much to adidas’s considerable annoyance.

Adidas have informed the FA and their sponsored players that they will be in breach of contract if they wear any Nike apparel that doesn’t also showcase the Three Lions branding. The FA, who are revamping their commercial operation, are relaxed about Nike’s ambush  tactics but it puts Gerrard in particular in a tricky position when he wants to concentrate on the football. ........................................................................................................ During a World Cup in which the BBC have fielded their first ever all-black panel - Thierry Henry, Rio Ferdinand and Clarence Seedorf - at a major championship as part of a welcome diversity push, the FA parted company with Noel Blake, national coach for seven years and one of the few elite black coaches in the game. The split hasn’t gone unnoticed by the FA inclusion board charged with overseeing the campaign to increase the number of black managers and coaches in the game. Minister for Sport Helen Grant said in Sao Paulo on Thursday: ‘I do want to see much more done across football.’ Sir Tim Rice, who is far more likely to be seen at Lord’s watching the cricket, saw his first England football away match for 51 years in Manaus. The last time Sir Tim saw England play abroad was in 1963 while he was a student in Paris. He was invited to  England’s World Cup opener after bringing his Lion King show to Sao Paulo. .............................................................................

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who already has ambassador roles with Hublot, Yahoo, Jaguar and the United Nations World Food  Programme, has started talks with BT Sport about representing them as well. BT see Mourinho as their response to Sky  having David Beckham as their £4m-a-year ambassador, although Jose is expected to be cheaper for BT, who are also making overtures to Sir Alex Ferguson ahead of their Champions League coverage that starts in 2015-16. Mourinho used to be a Sky ambassador, describing their 2009 football coverage as ‘special’. Call up: Jose Mourinho, who already has an ambassador role with Yahoo, has started talks with BT . Phil Neville is not the only BBC co-commentator who has attracted criticism from inside the Corporation.

"If you want to use your phone in London stay out of St Pancras, while people who want to talk on the phone on the train are best off with Three. That’s according to new research that looked at popular commuting routes in the capital. And they found one in three internet tasks were dropped and one in seven calls failed during testing. Scroll down for interactive map . Engineers have tested voice and data connections in London (shown in map). They travelled back and forth on the ten most popular lines. All were found to be plagued by poor voice and data connections. One in three internet tasks were dropped during testing . The research was carried out by Global Wireless Solutions (GWS). They carried out high-level tests while travelling back and forth on the ten most popular commuting routes in and our of London. And they found that the lines were plagued by reliability issues for both voice calls and data transfers. When attempting to send data ‘packets’ while on the routes, one in four 3G packets and one in three 4G packets didn’t send properly. EE, O2 and Vodafone were all found to rely heavily on their older 2G networks. Vodafone customers got the best 3G data service, while EE offered the best 4G service. But GWS’ testing suggests that it’s not just the mobile internet that Londoners struggle to use while commuting: one in seven voice calls (14 per cent) made from trains fail too. Three was a clear winner for call quality and reliability here. The poor service from the other operators was blamed on their continued use of 2G and half-rate codecs. One in seven calls were also found to fail due to networks still using 2G, although Three was found to be the best. Meanwhile the worst station to get a connection was found to be St Pancras . Meanwhile, one in four of the data task failures (24.18 per cent to be exact) GWS’ engineers experienced occurred while they were on trains in stations, while one in five occurred when they were on trains on open stretches of track. However, voice calls are more likely to fail on open track than in a station; one in four of the voice ‘failures’ GWS’ engineers experienced occurred when they were in a station, compared to 1 in 3 when they were on open track. GWS found that voice and data failures are more likely to occur when a train is travelling from zero to five miles (eight kilometres) per hour than when it is travelling between speeds of five and 50 (eight and 80 kilometres) per hour. Failures are most likely to occur when a train is travelling above 50mph (80km/h). For stations, St Pancras has by far and away the worst connectivity of all of those tested by GWS. The engineers experienced an average of 99 voice and packet data failures (across the four operators) while testing in the famous station. Paul Carter, CEO of GWS, commented: 'Leaves on the track, the wrong kind of snow, having to stand up all the way to work and back - commuters have enough to contend with without the kind of mobile connectivity problems we’re revealing today. 'It’s hard to believe we’re in 2014 and in a situation whereby a trained wizard would have a tough time getting a signal on the Hogwarts Express while it’s sitting in St Pancras. 'Pressure from commuters makes it inevitable that trains won’t keep their status as mobile dead zones for much longer. 'It’d be great to see networks, rail operators and station-masters taking the lead on improving connectivity for commuters - rather than having to be dragged into the 21st Century kicking and screaming.'","Engineers have tested voice and data connections in London .

"One restaurant has launched a 'hate us on Yelp' campaign, rewarding diners who've left negative reviews with a discount. Botto Bistro in Richmond, California, which is in protest of Yelp's alleged practice of manipulating ratings, is hoping to prove that nasty reviews won't impact its success. The Italian eatery is offering a 25per cent discount on its pizzas to anyone who gives it just one star, and plans to share the funniest insults in its newsletter at the end of the month. Humble pie: Botto Bistro in Richmond, California, is offering a 25per cent discount on its pizzas in exchange for a one-star rating on Yelp . The author of the winning review will also receive a free ticket for its cooking classes. 'You can lie or tell the truth, make it hilarious, tell the world how horrible our establishment is, talk about the toilet seat temperature, the aliens in our bathrooms, how much you hate our food, and so on,' Botto Bistro's website advises. One tongue-in-cheek Yelp review reads: '1. They don't deliver to Los Angeles. It's only 6-8 hours away depending on traffic. 2. Brad Pitt doesn't work there :( was hoping to see him. 3. They asked what I wanted, I said ""world peace"" and they didn't deliver.' Funny business: The Italian restaurant is challenging customers to come up with tongue-in-cheek complaints to protest Yelp's alleged practice of manipulating reviews . Another complaint says: 'My boyfriend took me here for dinner the other night, and I totally thought he was going to propose... but he DIDN'T. Obviously this is the restaurant's fault, and not the fact that I purposefully killed his pet goldfish the other day and frequently read his emails in order to find out if he's cheating on me.' A third one reads: ‘My food arrived before I wanted it to come. It was too hot to eat. It brought back all kinds of terrible memories of eating in Italy.’ The restaurant explains its reason for encouraging the hilariously absurd feedback on its website. 'Our goal? We want to be the restaurant with the lowest score on Yelp, we want to be the worst! Why? We want to prove that low score and bad reviews don't impact us and any other successful restaurants,' it says. Feeding frenzy: The restaurant's Yelp page is now full of sarcastic grievances, such as 'It brought back all kinds of terrible memories of eating in Italy’ 'We have heard many stories about Yelp threatening businesses and forcing them to advertise with them. Over the last few years we have received some of those phone calls too. Botto Bistro's owner, Davide Cerretini, told ABC News that Yelp emailed him on Monday with the following message: . 'If you are offering incentives in exchange for reviews, we ask that you immediately discontinue such activity. If we learn that this type of behavior has continued, we may take action on your Business Account which could include suspending access to your listing. It may also result in a Consumer Alert being placed on your listing.' Cerretini said he sarcastically responded: 'I'm contacting you from the Botto User Support Team because we've received complaints from the community that you may be removing reviews in exchange of vague explanations to loyal customers.' Yelp has denied claims by small business owners that it manipulates ratings based on whether businesses are advertisers. Two weeks ago, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that even if the site did manipulate reviews to penalize businesses, it would not constitute extortion. The court said that Yelp has no obligation to publish positive reviews, and that the company can seek payments for its advertising.","Botto Bistro in Richmond, California, is protesting Yelp's alleged practice of manipulating ratings ."

"Scientists have created a map of the matter in a segment of the universe, which could reveal how the universe came to be. The incredible ‘pencil beam’ shows the distribution of the cosmic web across a slice of the sky 10.8 billion years ago. Amazingly it accurately predicts where galaxies will appear - and it could help us understand the evolution of the universe, both into the past and the future. Researchers led by the Max Planck Institute of Astronomy in Germany have observed a 'pencil beam' of the universe's cosmic web. This animation shows the slice of the night sky seen by the team. Denser regions of matter are bright, while the darker regions show the 'voids' between galaxies . The research was led by Dr Khee-Gan Lee from the Max Planck Institute of Astronomy in Germany. The three-dimensional map shows the ‘adolescent’ universe as it appeared just three billion years after the Big Bang, which occurred about 13.8 billion years ago. Using a technique similar to an X-ray computer-tomographic (CT) scan used in medicine, the researchers revealed the dense grid of light from background galaxies. The snippet we see here, though, merely predicts where galaxies will appear based on the density of matter and dark matter in certain areas of the universe - the cosmic web - before galaxies formed. 'The cosmic web is a nickname for the way in which matter is distributed on the largest scales of millions of light-years,' explains Dr Lee to MailOnline. 'This pattern has been seen in the nearby universe when astronomers plot the positions of a large numbers of galaxies. 'In the nearby universe, we see the galaxies arranged along the web-like filaments that intersect in 'galaxy clusters'. However, at greater distances it becomes progressively harder to measure large numbers of galaxy positions to do this kind of mapping, therefore our 'CT scan' instead uses the imprint of hydrogen gas, which also traces matter, to map out the cosmic web in 3D. 'The structures in our map represent the cosmic web at a much earlier stage of its growth, when the universe was merely a quarter its current age.' This is made possible as the light from background galaxies passes through hydrogen gas in the universe. In the map the lighter areas show regions of high-density matter where galaxies would ultimately form, while the black regions show ‘voids’ - the space between galaxies. The astronomers used the Keck I telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii to make the map. In total they managed to observe the segment of space for four hours, although they had been hoping for longer. However that was enough time to create the three-dimensional section of the universe almost 11 billion light-years away. Speaking to MailOnline, Dr Xavier Prochaska from the University of California Santa Cruz, who was part of the research team, commented on the significance of the 3D map. ‘At the top level it’s a test of our current theory of cosmology,' he tells MailOnline. 'It shows us how the universe forms over cosmic time.' He described the segment as a ‘pinhole through the universe’ or a ‘pencil beam’ showing its grand history. Lead researcher Dr Lee, meanwhile, adds: ‘This is the first time people have used light to map the universe in such a way in 3D. ‘They have used it in the past, but previously it has always been to study the cosmic web in 1D, directionally along the line of sight.’ The segment, seen here, was 100 million light-years in length, 2.5 million light-years wide and six million light-years tall. It was made using the Keck I observatory and peering further and further into space. The results reveal the density of matter in this region of the universe, with brighter regions containing more . The snippet of the universe seen here was taken 10.8 billion years ago, and predicts where galaxies will appear based on the density of matter and dark matter in certain areas - the cosmic web. This is made possible as the light from background galaxies passes through hydrogen gas in the universe . The astronomers used the Keck I telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory (shown) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii to make the map. In total they managed to observe the segment of space for four hours, although they had been hoping for longer. In December this year they will attempt to make longer observations . This is also the first time the cosmic web has been mapped at such a vast distance. Since observing to such immense distances is also looking back in time, the map reveals the early stages of cosmic structure formation when the universe was only a quarter of its current age. This was during an era when the galaxies were undergoing a major ‘growth spurt’. The map provides a tantalising glimpse of giant structures extending across millions of light-years, and paves the way for more extensive studies that should reveal not only the structure of the cosmic web, but also details of how it works. This includes the ways that gas moved around the web into galaxies, providing the raw material for the growth of galaxies through the formation of stars and planets. Dr Lee explains that the map should be able to predict the existence of these galaxies - and perhaps even some too small to see by other methods. And he also says it could help us understand the physics that govern galaxy formation, and even understand the future of the universe. ‘An understanding of the past will help us better predict the future of the universe,’ he says. The researchers add they will be hoping to repeat the experiment later this year, possibly in December, and map an even larger segment of the universe. This is the first time the cosmic web has been mapped (shown) at such a vast distance. Since observing to such immense distances is also looking back in time, the map reveals the early stages of cosmic structure formation when the universe was only a quarter of its current age .","Researchers led by the Max Planck Institute of Astronomy in Germany have observed a 'pencil beam' of the universe's cosmic web .

"Who needs airport bartenders when there's a perfect pint pulling machine to do all the hard work? This genius automated beer dispenser is quite the draw in the All Nippon Airways Alliance Gold Lounge at Japan's Kansai International Airport (KIX). The Asahi machine works exactly like a fountain drinks dispenser but with one very important extra: it has a tilt feature to help drinkers get the right amount of head on their drink, without spilling a single drop. Self-service: A man grabs a glass and prepares to use the automated draft beer dispenser . Thirsty travellers help themselves to a chilled pint glass and simply place it on the drinks stand, before pressing a button on the machine. With a soft, robotic whirr the back of the stand swiftly moves forward, gently tilting as golden liquid streams down from the overhead nozzle. Pour: The man places the glass in the machine and presses the buttons . Tilt: Moments later the machine tilts the glass at the required angle and pours in the beer . Head: The machine then straightens up the glass and a head is poured into the glass creating the perfect pint . As the pint glass gets filled, the stand reverts to its original position and a six-second spurt from the machine fills the rest of the glass with a perfect head. The perfectly poured suds are now ready to drink . The automated draft beer dispenser is one of only an estimated five in the country.

"This incredible footage shows a daredevil pilot holding on tight as he flies a replica of a 1938 Hitler Youth glider. The man, who is strapped to the seat of the wooden aircraft, soars hundreds of feet above German countryside - as pilots would have done before the outbreak of the Second World War. The pilot, wearing goggles and breathing apparatus, brings the glider down without a bump as he executes a textbook landing. Scroll down for videos . The pilot takes to the skies over Germany, just as gliders would during the 1930s under the rule of Adolf Hitler . Holding on to a video camera, the pilot soars hundreds of feet above the fields below while breathing through an oxygen mask and wearing goggles . The confident pilot turns as he begins his descent into the airfield from where he took off, pictured right . The modern day airman seems much more sturdy in the air than a Hitler Youth pilot appears in archive footage, shot in 1938 when the gliders were often used by the young military men. The video, from just a year before the outbreak of WWII, shows Hitler Youth members running down a hill, dragging a glider along the ground until it lifts off. A dozen shirtless boys are seen charging down a hill, with six pulling each rope until the aircraft soars into the sky. The pilot grips on to the glider's steering shaft as he prepares for take-off. His trousers flap in the wind as the craft soars into the air, wobbling slightly as it heads towards the camera. While some of the young men were too young to serve for the German army at the outbreak of the WWII, all members of the Hitler Youth were involved in the war effort, working for the fire service and helping with the recovery effort after Allied bombing raids. After bringing the fragile, wooden glider down with a textbook landing, the pilot smiles and gives a thumbs up . The Hitler Youth, aged between 14 and 18, were brainwashed into being part of Adolf Hitler's plans to form an Aryan super-race . Members went on to become soldiers for the German military machine, with skilled fighters joining the Waffen SS. The Treaty of Versailles - signed after the First World War by Germany, Britain, the U.S., France, Japan and Italy - prohibited Germany from having more than 100,000 soldiers. The nation was also banned from having a navy or air force. To get around this, pilots would be trained in gliders as they were not outlawed by the Treaty. In 1935, Hitler breached the agreement by introducing compulsory conscription and rebuilding the German armed forces. Despite this, the Nazis continued to use their glider squadron up to and including WWII. The amazing archive footage shows Hitler Youth members preparing for take-off in a glider in 1938 . The pilot grips on tightly as 12 shirtless boys start hauling it behind them as they run down a hill . Take-off: The craft, which has no engine, quickly lifts off as the boys let go of the two ropes . Before the two countries were at war, in May 1940, the German glider infantry landed at a Belgian fort. More than 80 soldiers used the gliders to launch a silent, surprise raid on the fort, suffering only 21 casualties. This led to the Allies forming their own airlanding infantry, which included large wooden planes which could carry up to seven tons of cargo. Britain's had 5,000 gliders by the end of the war, but they were quickly put out of service because of technological advances.","Pilot flies 1938 replica glider over Germany - just as airmen did before WWII .

"Uruguay are considering the option of resting Luis Suarez for their World Cup group encounter with England in Sao Paulo next week. If they kick off their tournament campaign with a win against Costa Rica on Sunday, they could take the decision conscious that Chile’s Arturo Vidal has struggled to recover from an almost identical knee injury. Sources in Uruguay already believe that Suarez is unlikely to face the Costa Ricans in the opening game for Oscar Tabarez’s team. Recovering: But Luis Suarez may not feature against England next week in Sao Paolo . Nutted: Suarez joins his Uruguay team-mates for a training session . Keepy ups: Diego Lugano controlling the ball at a practice session . Last hurrah: And the Golden Ball winner from the last World Cup, Diego Forlan, is also involved . Learning: Chile's Arturo Vidal has struggled to recover from an almost identical injury . But only if they failed to take three points this weekend would they feel it necessary to rush Suarez back for what would then be a key clash against Roy Hodgson’s side. The fact is there is an acute awareness in the Uruguayan camp of the crisis which has hit Chile after they brought back Vidal, the Juventus midfielder, too early. The 27-year-old underwent knee surgery in early May to repair a meniscus – the same knee condition which saw Liverpool striker Suarez break down in Uruguay training and require an operation. There were confident claims from Santiago that Vidal would be back for the World Cup. But a surprise 15-minute appearance in a friendly against Northern Ireland in Montevideo on May 30 proved disastrous. Vidal’s knee swelled badly and now his hopes of appearing for the Chileans here in Brazil are in serious doubt. Easing him in: Suarez has been taking part in some light ball work at training this week . Vidal is as important to Chile – who face a tough group with Spain and the Netherlands - as Suarez is to Uruguay. Uruguay coach Tabárez said: ‘We have no set deadlines with Suarez. I don’t know if we’ll have him for the first match, for the second, for the third. If it were up to me, Suárez would play tomorrow.’ Suarez has trained alone at Uruguay’s Belo Horizonte base this week. He has worked with the ball, taking soft shots and short passes with his right leg but as yet has not put his left leg under any real strain.","Suarez in light training after knee surgery, but is expected to miss out against Costa Rica .

"Clad in white jodhpurs and blinking in the bright Spanish sunshine, Athina Onassis looked every inch the showjumper as  the opening round of the Furusiyya FEI Nations Cup Jumping Finals got underway in Barcelona yesterday. Unfortunately, the heiress' bid for the Coca-Cola Trophy came to an early end, after she clocked up 12 faults and was placed 57th out of 63 riders. Onassis, 29, who is the only living descendant of Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, was riding grey mare AD Camille Z during the event, which is one of the most prestigious in world showjumping. Excitement: Athina and husband Doda were competing in the Furusiyya FEI Nations Cup Jumping Final . Relaxed: Athina, who is famously reclusive, looked relaxed as she chatted to a friend in the ring . Her husband, the Brazilian rider Álvaro de Miranda Neto, 41,  did better and with AD Nouvelle Europe Z, chalked up just two faults and managed a respectable 24th place. The winner of the Coca-Cola Trophy, however, was Canada's Eric Lamaze  who managed an almost perfect round on his horse Fine Lady. Veteran Brazilian rider Pedro Veniss took second place with his horse Amemoi O Sandor, while France's Pénélope Leprovost and Sultane Des Ibis came third. While Onassis might not always get what she wants in her riding career, she has long called the shots in her own life, shrugging off her family's fame and living a quiet life in Brazil's largest city São Paulo with her husband instead. Walking the course: Athina, along with the other competitors, spent some time inspecting the course . Top tips: Onassis gets some advice from husband Doda, who eventually managed a 24th place finish . The only child of Christina Onassis, the late shipping tycoon's daughter, she inherited 55 per cent of his fortune - which is believed to be worth billions - on his death. Since then, Onassis has dedicated herself to carving out an equestrian career, although an injury last year proved a serious setback. Onassis, who competes for Greece, is rarely seen in public but has made an unusually large number of appearances in recent months, as her showjumping career hots up. Most recently, she was spotted competing in London at the Longines Global Champions Tour in August, alongside fellow famous riders, Jessica Springsteen and Sofia Abramovich. Although she and her husband, who is affectionately known as Doda, failed to put in an appearance at the launch party, she did manage a clear round in the ring  on her bay mare, AD Rose du Valon.

"Former Spain midfielder Marcos Senna is backing Diego Costa to have a 'great World Cup' and to be as big a success with the reigning world and European champions as he has been with Atletico Madrid. Brazil-born Senna opted to play for Spain over the country of his birth and played a vital role in La Roja ending their international drought to win Euro 2008, their first major trophy in 44 years. Costa has followed in the former Villarreal stalwart's footsteps by choosing to declare for Spain, where he has lived since 2007, despite playing two friendly matches for Brazil in 2013. Ready to go: Diego Costa and his Spanish team-mates arrived in Brazil on Sunday ahead of the World Cup . Back in action: Diego Costa gets away from El Salvador's Xavier Garcia during Spain's 2-0 win on Saturday . Too strong: Costa holds off El Salvador's Jonathan Barrios as he stepped up his preparation for the World Cup . Costa made his second appearance for Vicente del Bosque's side in a 2-0 win over El Salvador on Saturday, proving he had recovered from the hamstring injury that forced him to be substituted after nine minutes of the Champions League final. The striker looks set to make his competitive debut for his adopted country in Spain's World Cup opener with Holland in Salvador on Friday and is expected to receive a frosty reception from Brazilian fans. However, Senna believes his compatriot will not be affected by the hostile atmosphere that could await him. 'Diego has such a big personality that makes him even stronger and he won't be daunted by the whistling in Brazil, quite the opposite,' the 37-year-old, now playing for the New York Cosmos, was quoted as saying in the Spanish press. Costa, who scored 36 goals in all . competitions last season as Atletico won the Primera Division title, . looks on the verge of a move to Chelsea later this summer. Leading the way: Marcos Senna, in action against Sweden at Euro 2008, chose to play for Spain over Brazil . But before he arrives at Stamford Bridge, Senna believes Costa will enjoy a successful World Cup. 'He is a star, and I have been telling him that he will do as well for Spain as he has done for Atletico,' he added. 'Diego is very prepared psychologically and he's going to have a great World Cup. 'There are some people who do not agree with what he has done [deciding to play for Spain over Brazil] but there are also people who support him. The most important thing is that he is focused and demonstrates what a great player he is.'","Costa and Senna both chose to play for Spain over Brazil .

"Click here for more from our brilliant Match Zone, including this map of Tim Cahill's stunning goal for Australia. This, even Louis van Gaal would have to concede, was not a game for sitting on a barstool. It was a game that had you on your feet. That had you wondering if the World Cup that keeps on giving really can get any better. The finest players on the planet will certainly do well here in Brazil to better Tim Cahill’s 21st minute strike; an equaliser that goes straight into the greatest volleys in history file alongside men like Marco van Basten, Tony Yeboah, Paolo Di Canio and Robin van Persie. It was Australia’s 10th World Cup goal and a perfect one at that. But it was more than just the quality of the goals. It was the sheer, unexpected drama of the encounter. The courage and determination of an Australian team, the lowest ranked side in the competition, that dared to dream and dared even to lead the beaten finalists of 2010 and most recent conquerors of Spain.

They did so because the Dutch were complacent, and defensively disorganised. Having beaten Spain 5-1, they clearly thought this was going to be easy. How wrong they were. Arjen Robben might have opened the scoring but after little more than a minute Cahill had levelled in spectacular style, and deservedly so. Australia had been the better team against their apathetic opponents, maintaining that momentum to the break. For Van Gaal it was proving most uncomfortable. More even than he imagined when he complained that a restricted view meant he might have to stand, or perhaps bring a barstool, to see from the sunken dug-outs. It seemed he did get the television cameraman moved, having also moaned about that. But the Australians were giving him a much bigger problem, so much so that Van Gaal abandoned the 3-5-2 formation he had employed for this tournament and switched to a back four. In fairness to Manchester United’s next manager, he had said a back four might work better against these opponents. Deadly: Holland winger Arjen Robben (right) drives the ball into the bottom corner to give his side the lead . Nothing but net: Robben's powerful effort eludes Australia goalkeeper Matthew Ryan .

It proved a smart move, even if his . side first had to overcome an Australia penalty before Robin van Persie . struck an equaliser and Memphis Depay produced a slightly fortuitous . winner. After that . thumping victory against Spain Van Gaal stuck with the same side, no . doubt in the hope of being able to rest players in their final group . game. Australia made just . two changes, bringing in Ryan McGowan and Matt McKay. But they employed . the same determined approach they demonstrated against Chile. Even . though they lost that game, their effort could not be faulted. Indeed . here they actually displayed more energy than the Dutch in the opening . exchanges. Van Gaal’s side were a little sluggish and disjointed. Perhaps even a touch complacent. But a goal for the Dutch nevertheless came, and far too easily for Australia’s liking. It was classic Robben, from the manner in which he escaped the clutches of Alex Wilkinson to the way he then accelerated away before driving a low, left-foot shot past Matthew Ryan. But it was the failure to close him down, in particular by Matthew Spiranovic, that would have disappointed Ange Postecoglou. On the spot: Mile Jedinak scores from the penalty spot to put Australia in front on 54 minutes . Perfect penalty: Jedinak's spot-kick is fired into the bottom corner of the Holland goal . All smiles: Jedinak celebrates his goal as his Australia team-mates run to join him at the Estadio Beira-Rio . Of course, Australia’s coach was on . his feet only 69 seconds later, courtesy of Cahill’s quite staggering . finish. It was brilliant, spectacular; the fashion in which he connected . with McGowan’s long diagonal ball just fantastic; a left-foot volley, . his weaker foot, crashing home off the underside of the crossbar. A . further opportunity would fall to Robben but to Mark Bresciano an even . better chance would come. He had the goal at his mercy but just when it . seemed he would send Australia into a most unexpected lead, he blasted . his effort over the bar. If Van Gaal’s view was less restricted, he would not have been happy with what he was seeing. Even less so when Cahill caught Bruno Martins Indi with a foolishly late challenge. Particularly foolish given it earned the former Everton midfielder a yellow card that rules him out of the final group game against Spain. It also marked the end if Martins Indi’s afternoon. He left the field on a stretcher, with Depay coming on to replace him. Lining it up: Holland striker Robin van Persie (centre) prepares to strike the ball at goal . Rocket: Van Persie smashes a powerful strike into the roof of Australia's net to make it 2-2 . Jumping for joy: Manchester United striker Van Persie leaps into the air to celebrate his goal . The half-time statistics said it all, . though. Australia had enjoyed 51 per cent of the ball and they had . managed five shots to Holland’s four. Van Gaal needed to make a change . and he did, switching to that back four formation. No . sooner had the second half started than Van Persie had also collected a . booking – for a naughty lash out at Matthew Spiranovic - that excludes . him from the next game. So that was both centre-forwards in the book. But Van Gaal’s mood would darken further still, with the sight of Mile Jedinak scoring the 54th minute penalty that put Australia ahead. The penalty, while it clearly struck Daryl Janmatt’s hands, was harsh given the arm was down and Oliver Bozanic’s cross was struck from close-range. But Djamel Haimoudi pointed immediately to the spot and the Australia captain converted with ease. Under pressure: Australia's Tommy Oar (right) attempts a pass as Robin van Persie (left) closes him down . Going down: Australia midfielder Mark Bresciano falls on top of Holland's Nigel de Jong during the first half .

Yellow: Cahill is booked after clashing with Holland defender Bruno Martins Indi (right) Game over: Martins Indi is placed on a stretcher and taken off the pitch after being injured . Four minutes later and the Dutch would . draw level, Van Persie turning brilliantly on a neat pass from Depay . before slotting his shot beyond the reach of Ryan. But . Van Persie was flirting dangerously with controversy too, a clattering . challenge on Jedinak serious enough for the Algerian referee to at least . consider a second yellow for the Holland skipper. In . the end, the Dutch just proved too strong, too technical good, for the . courageous Australians, even if McKay perhaps should have scored prior . to Depay’s 68th minute winner; a 30-yard shot that Ryan, on reflection, . is sure to feel he should have saved.","Substitute Depay completed Holland's comeback after Australia had led 2-1 .

"Ronny Deila has spent 38 years clinging to the notion mother knows best. Clutching a green and white shirt in the Number Seven Suite at Celtic Park it was time for a rethink. A qualified teacher, the Norwegian dovetailed his career as a defender at Odd Grenland with a full-time education. The assumption was the football would never amount to anything. ‘My mother said that I could never make a living from football,’ he explained. ‘So I needed an education. Up for the challenge: Newly-appointed Celtic manager Ronny Deila speaks during a press conference . Smile for the cameras: Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell (left) unveils Deila as the new manager . ‘She finally said to me when I was coming here yesterday “okay, I was wrong…""' His mother is not alone in being confounded by her son’s appointment as the 18th manager of Celtic. Former . coach of unfashionable Stromsgodset, Deila is an unexpected arrival. Former Parkhead striker Andy Walker describes the choice as . ‘underwhelming’. To . those who expected Henrik Larsson or Roy Keane to be standing on Celtic . Way yesterday, scarf raised, that is a view with some traction. Facing the media: Deila and Lawwell speak to journalists at a press conference at Celtic Park . Yet Deila cut an impressive and sure-footed figure, combining quiet confidence and conviction with humility. On social media and beyond Celtic supporters are broadly supportive. Many were uninspired by Larsson and Keane as options and praise their club for ‘thinking outside the box’. To others the new man is simply the ‘cheap option’. It’s undeniable that Deila ia a risky . choice. He has never managed in the Champions League but will be . expected to negotiate three rounds of qualifying within six weeks. Failure will place him under immediate and sustained pressure. How . a Scandinavian coach with no experience of British football will cope . with the demands and pressure of Celtic is the million dollar question. At Stromsgodset the average crowd was 6000. At Celtic they will be ten . times that on European nights. This is a club where managers with . greater experience than Ronny Deila have been chewed up and spat out . like old tobacco. ‘I have . been in football for many, many years,’ responded the new man. ‘I have . been a manager now for seven years in Stromsgodset. New man in town: Ronny Deila waves to the supporters as he arrives at Celtic Park . Driven in: Deila sits in the back seat of a car as he arrives at Celtic Park . ‘The difference here is the atmosphere and I can’t say how I’m going to react to that - but I know I am a quick learner and that’s the most important thing. ‘You have to learn from experiences, and develop, and that’s what I want. I have to be humble. ‘You can ask me questions about Europe - can I deal with it? - we’ll see. But I’m a quick learner. ‘I . just have to look around me and use my energy on the most important . thing and that’s the product, what’s happening on the pitch. All around, . if the product is good then good things will come from that.’ Unarguably, . he delivered a strong product at his last club. Appointed head coach of . Stromsgodset at 32, Deila took a club described as the Kilmarnock of . Norwegian football from 11th place in the league to their first title in . 43 years. But . in an insular landscape like Scotland people are already racking their . brains for examples of Norwegian managers succeeding in British . football. Revealed: A picture of the new Celtic third kit for next season was leaked on Twitter . Stale Solbakken failed at Wolves. Egil Olsen failed at Wimbledon. Henning Berg failed at Blackburn and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was unable to keep Cardiff City afloat in the English Premiership. ‘I don’t go around thinking that I am bringing all of Norway with me,’ shrugged the latest man to have a go. ‘But I know the Norwegian people want me to succeed. ‘I have my own way of thinking about the . job. I don’t know what other Norwegians have done. We are different . people. In Scotland not everyone is the same. I will do everything I can . to succeed and I hope that will help Norway as well.’ The . expectation is that a Swede would replace Neil Lennon. Henrik Larsson . met major shareholder Dermot Desmond. Roy Keane did as well. When the box office options ruled themselves out Deila emerged as a very different candidate. The . Norwegian is also a prototype of how people imagine Peter Lawwell’s . perfect Celtic manager. His salary will be manageable. He worked with a . budget at Stromsgodset, he developed young players and he understood the . need to sell. Big job: Deila (left) will replace Neil Lennon at Celtic after the Northern Irishman quit . Lawwell says he is a ‘good fit’ for the Celtic model and was always in the club’s thinking. Last winter Deila turned down Malmo because the job didn’t feel right. Celtic were different. ‘I had the feeling I was wanted, it felt different,’ he said. ‘It is the philosophy and the values and you feel you can be a part of it. I didn’t say Malmo was bad at that - but I felt ready here and that this is the right step.’ Deila also had the all-important Desmond seal of approval after a meeting early this week. ‘It was a very good meeting,’ said the Norwegian. ‘He sees things. ‘I could have left the room after three minutes because he had already read me. ‘He has unbelievable knowledge and how he’s putting things together, so I have big respect for him.’ At . first Celtic saw Deila as a possible assistant manager. Neil Lennon . confirmed as much in an interview yesterday, saying he was asked to . consider the Norwegian as a possible replacement when Johan Mjallby . left. No go: Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane asked not to be considered for the Celtic job . Some will ask how a coach regarded as a potential No2 can become the main man so swiftly, but it hardly matters now. Mjallby’s replacement will now be a Scot, with John Collins the leading candidate. Intriguingly, rumour has it that . Collins and Celtic skipper Scott Brown have an uneasy relationship from . their days at Hibernian. But . Deila sees the need for a Scottish assistant who knows his way around . Inverness without a sat nav and will meet other candidates as well. He . has no intention of importing his Stromsgodset players and staff en . masse. ‘It is really . important to have people who are from Scotland and from Celtic,’ he . admitted. ‘You never know what will happen, maybe foreign people or . players will come. But there are a lot of good people working in Scotland.’ He . speaks in flawless English, but also speaks German fluently. A father . of 14-year-old twin daughters he is a keen student of the game, touring . continental clubs – Dortmund, Liverpool, Rennes, Manchester City – to . enhance his coaching experience. Backing: Predecessor Neil Lennon has backed Deila's credentials after he came highly recommended . The Manchester trip proved pivotal. Celtic sources say the English club recommended the Norwegian and while in England he travelled north to take in his one and only Celtic match. ‘I was here for the Barcelona game. I went to see the Celtic-Barcelona under-19s and then I went to the main match, too,’ he revealed. ‘The day before I was at Manchester City-Bayern Munich, under-19s and the first teams. That was an unbelievable experience, to be here. The atmosphere and everything. ‘I almost never take pictures - but I filmed that. So many times I have looked at that film, when ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ was sung before the match. I showed my girls. ‘At that point I didn’t know that this was going to happen. I’ve been a Liverpool fan – but  I think the atmosphere is much better here. ‘When I’m driving the car home at night, I get goosebumps when I think about it. ‘That is football. It’s fun to win, but the way to win is the most fun thing. ‘I hope I can sit in my car driving to my apartment somewhere near here and feel that emotion many times.’","Ronny Deila named new Celtic manager .

"The Michelin Guide's latest roster of top New York City restaurants says Brooklyn and Queens are hot, but Daniel Boulud has lost a little sizzle. For the past three years, the same seven restaurants have held a virtual lock on the organization's coveted three-star rating: Daniel, Per Se, Masa, Le Bernardin, Eleven Madison Park, Jean Georges and Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare. But this year, only six maintained the honor for the guide's 10th edition, which goes on sale Wednesday. Daniel, Boulud's flagship Upper East Side restaurant, was bumped down to two stars. 'We obviously prefer to give stars than to take them away. Unfortunately, over numerous meals this year at Daniel he just wasn't firing on all cylinders to maintain a third star,' Michael Ellis, director of the Michelin guides, said by telephone Tuesday. 'There's not one thing that I could point out. There was just not that consistency over the meals.' Down to two stars: Daniel Boulud's Manhattan restaurant, Daniel, has been docked of a Michelin star in the latest New York guide . Stalwarts: Per Se (left) and Eleven Madison Park (right) have retained their three-star statuses . Michelin guides, which cover 24 countries, are considered among the premier ratings of the restaurant world. Based on the experiences of anonymous inspectors, the guides award ratings of one, two or three stars using criteria including quality of ingredients, mastery of technique, how the chef's personality is expressed in the food, and consistency. A total of 874 restaurants spanning 60 cuisines are included in the 2015 edition of the New York City guide; 73 of them got star ratings. Ellis said some of the most exciting cooking in New York is happening outside Manhattan. Twenty of the restaurants included in the guide added stars (including some that earned their first star). Of those, 11 were outside Manhattan, including eight in Brooklyn. 'This shows the exciting, vibrant cooking scene that is in the outer boroughs,' he said. Brooklyn has a total of 10 starred restaurants, including several new additions: California American-inspired Delaware and Hudson; Polo Dobkin's Meadowsweet; Andy Ricker's Pok Pok Ny; Take Root; La Vera; and Lucksus at Torst. Queens has four: Casa Enrique, Danny Brown Wine Bar and Kitchen, M. Wells Steakhouse and Zabb Elee.

"By . Donna Sawyer . and . Amy Ziniak for Daily Mail Australia . Former swimming star Grant Hackett has talked to police about the night he was allegedly seen walking through a casino semi naked, searching for his son. Hackett was photographed looking panicked in the foyer of the Crown Casino in Melbourne on February 22, allegedly shirtless and barefoot as he desperately searched for his four year old son that went missing. A witness told the Herald Sun the former Olympic champion was in the foyer of the Casino, asking if anyone had seen his son Jagger. Scroll down for video . Panicked search: Grant Hackett searches for his four-year-old son Jagger in foyer of Crown Casino, Melbourne . The Australian reports Hackett's manager, Chris White, confirmed that the swimming champion had voluntarily attended a Melbourne police station on Friday to answer questions about the incident. It's believed he was in Melbourne to spent time with his twins, Charlize and Jagger, 5,  and returned to the Gold Coast. 'There is little I can say at this stage,' Hackett told the Australian while at the airport. Police have confirmed they interviewed a 34 year old Queensland man regarding the Melbourne incident  and that he was released pending further inquiries. 'We cannot comment any further,' said a police media spokesperson. In February, Jagger had gone missing from the hotel room the family was staying in. He was later found safe and well by Crown Security within the casino complex, according to reports. It is unclear where exactly Jagger was found, but it is understood he was not on the gaming room floor or on any licensed premises. Hackett reportedly awoke in the early hours of Saturday morning when he realised his son had disappeared.

Marriage breakdown: Grant Hackett with ex-wife Candice Alley in November, 2010, at Melbourne Cup Day before splitting in April, 2012 . According to reports, Hackett was unable to locate the child in the room or the nearby corridors and ran into the foyer half-dressed asking for help. Hackett, who lives in Sydney, picked up Jagger and his twin sister Charlize and took them to Crown, where he regularly stays when in Melbourne. The former Olympic freestyle champion lives in Sydney following a nasty divorce with the twins’ mother, Candice Alley. The marriage ended in 2012, with Hackett later admiting in an interview he was rliant on Stillnox sleeping pills towards the end of his swimming career. Hackett also made headlines back in October, 2011 when he trashed the penthouse apartment he was staying in after Derby Day celebrations.

"Facebook has completed its purchase mobile messaging service WhatsApp for up to  $22 billion (£13.7 billion) in cash and stock in the firms biggest ever acquisition. This is an increase on the $19 billion (£11.8 billion) initially announced as Facebook's share price has risen since the deal was first announced. Facebook will pay $4.59 billion (£2.86 billion) in cash and 177,760,669 shares in the company, which have risen to $77 (£48) since February. Boom: The free instant messaging service created in 2009 has grown faster than Facebook in its five years, and now has more than 450 million monthly users around the world. Facebook has completed its purchase of mobile messaging service WhatsApp for up to $22 billion (£13.7 billion) Over 450 million people using the service each month. Firm has 50 employees. 70% of those people active on a given day. Messaging volume approaching the entire global telecom SMS volume. Service adds more than 1 million new registered users per day. 600m photos uploaded each day. 200m voice messages sent each day. The app's founders and employees will also be granted $3.5 billion (£2.2 billion) in restricted stock that they won't have access to for four years after the deal closes. European Union regulators approved the deal on Friday, clearing the way for the acquisition which some in the telecoms industry had opposed. But the EU said in a statement the two firms were 'not close competitors' and that consumers would continue to have a wide choice of communication apps. Facebook said it is keeping WhatsApp as a separate service, just as it did with Instagram, which it bought for about $715.3 (£447.3) million. 'The acquisition supports Facebook and WhatsApp's shared mission to bring more connectivity and utility to the world by delivering core internet services efficiently and affordably,' the social network said. WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly active users. In comparison, Twitter had 241 million users at the end of 2014. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said WhatsApp is on path to reach a billion users. 'The combination of WhatsApp and Facebook will allow us to connect many more people round the world,' Zuckerberg said. 'We want to develop more mobile experiences like Instagram and Messenger. 'WhatApp fits this vision perfectly, it has incredibly strong engagement and growth. It's the only app we've ever seen that has grown more quickly than Facebook itself.' 'Their product roadmap is very exciting and won't change. 'Overall, I'm very excited about this deal. WhatsApp had every option in the world, so I'm thrilled they chose us.' As part of the deal, WhatsApp co-founder and Chief Executive Jan Koum will join Facebook's board. European Union regulators approved the deal on Friday, clearing the way for the acquisition which some in the telecoms industry had opposed. WhatsApp is still growing and is predicted to have a billion users soon. It will continue as a separate service under Facebook . 'This is an incredible moment for . me,' Mr Koum said. 'Every day over 19bn messages are sent, with over 1 . million new users every day. 'We wanted it to be simple, and a better service than SMS.' 'We're . excited and honoured to partner with Mark and Facebook as we continue . to bring our product to more people around the world,' 'WhatsApp's . extremely high user engagement and rapid growth are driven by the . simple, powerful and instantaneous messaging capabilities we provide.' The sale of WhatsApp to Facebook for $19 billion has made its founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton billionaires overnight. But they are not your typical Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Success came to them late. The pair were well over 30 when they launched their messaging app in 2009. The duo stand out in Silicon Valley for their unusual approach. They both hate advertising and have paid for almost no marketing to make the five-year-old app a success. This may be because 37-year-old Koum and 42-year-old Acton had unusual backgrounds. Koum was born and raised in a small village outside of Kiev, Ukraine. Growing up, his home had no electricity or hot water. His parents, a housewife and a construction manager, avoided talking on the phone in case it was tapped by the state. Koum and his mother immigrated to Mountain View when he was 16. By 18, Koum had taught himself computer networking by buying manuals from a used book store and returning them when he’d finished. In 1997, Koum took a job at Yahoo sitting across a desk from Acton. They hit it off, because they enjoyed each others straight-down-the-line style. Michigan-born Acton studied engineering at the University of Central Florida and graduated in 1988. In May, 1992 he got a job at Rockwell International as systems administrator. Acton became Yahoo employee 44 in 1996, worked as software engineer, then senior software engineer, principal software engineer and director of engineering. The pair stayed with Yahoo for over a decade building their bond through games of ultimate frisbee.  In September 2007 Koum and Acton finally left Yahoo. They both applied to Facebook and were rejected. Instead they decided to set up their own venture, Whatsapp, now sold to Facebook for billions. According to reports, the success of Whatsapp hasn’t changed Koum or Acton. When a journalist visited the company's headquarters in July 2012, the Koum was barefoot and Acton was sporting flip-flops. The deal instantly makes WhatsApp cofounders Jan Koum and Brian Acton billionaires. Forbes estimates that Koum held about a 45 per cent stake in the company, while Acton’s stake was over 20 per cent. WhatsApp will remain based in . Mountain View, California, and Facebook said its own messenger app and . WhatsApp's core messaging product will continue to operate as separate . applications . Facebook was advised by Allen & Co, while WhatApp enlisted Morgan Stanley for the deal. The deal is the latest aquisition for Facebook, which last year bought Instagram. Proud moment: Jan Koum, pictured at a digital conference in January, described the deal as 'incredible'. Forbes estimates that Koum held about a 45 per cent stake in the company, while co-founder Brian Acton's stake was over 20 per cent . It also reportedly offered to pay close to $3 billion or more to acquire messaging service Snapchat, though that offer was spurned by the site's founders. Zuckerberg said WhatsApp would operate in the same way as Instagram, as a separate firm. 'It would be pretty stupid of us to interfere,' he said. He also said he was not planning to put ads on the service. 'Our strategy is to grow and connect people. Once we get to 2-3 billion people there are ways we can monetise. 'Now we want to focus on growing users. I don't think ads are the right way here.' Koum also pledged not to add adverts to WhatsApp, which makes money from a subscription model. 'We think advertising is not the way to go - we create a direct relationship with customers,' said Koum. 'We want to make the product better, faster and more efficient.' WhatsApp in numbers. The deal instantly makes WhatsApp cofounders Jan Koum and Brian Acton billionaires. Experts claim the deal could help Facebook attract teens . Experts claim the deal could help Facebook attract teens. Professor Will Stewart from the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) said: 'Obviously WhatsApp adds instant messaging to Facebook which must strengthen their position for the moment. 'Equally, all app types rise and fade, so established social media formats like Facebook will be overtaken by something new, and picking up candidates that might have ultimately replaced them may be a good survival strategy for a while. 'This does show the growing significance of mobile, though of course Facebook is on mobile anyway. 'But, Facebook has been around a while now so the real question is what comes next?'","This is an increase on the $19 billion (£11.8 billion) initially announced .

"Viewers will be able to catch up on their favourite shows online a month after they are first broadcast on TV, the BBC announced yesterday. Changes to the iPlayer service mean the current 'catch-up window' will be extended from the current seven days to 30 days. However it also means the BBC will come under even more pressure to close the legal loophole which currently allows half a million households to avoid the licence fee by watching only catch-up TV. Earlier this year, director general Tony Hall said he wanted to crack down on those who wait to watch on their tablets and computers for free. Scroll down for video . Changes to the iPlayer service mean the current 'catch-up window' will be extended from the current seven days to 30 days . Under current rules, only people who own television sets or watch TV as it is broadcast have to pay the £145.50 annual charge. The latest changes mean viewers will have even longer to download or stream programmes, making it even easier to avoid paying. The extension, which was formally approved by the BBC Trust earlier this year, has now come into force to coincide with the channel's autumn schedule. BBC chiefs expect dramas Peaky Blinders and The Fall will attract major demand for their iPlayer services. Commenting on the change, Lord Hall yesterday said: 'BBC iPlayer pioneered online viewing. It is recognised as not just the first but the best service of its type in the world. 'We have a fantastic autumn schedule and the public will now have more opportunities to watch the shows they love.' BBC chiefs expect dramas Peaky Blinders (pictured) and The Fall will attract major demand for iPlayer services . It will bring the BBC in line with ITV and Channel 4, which both give viewers a month to catch-up on their programmes. The Trust said in the space of just six months it had received almost 5,000 complaints from viewers who wanted programmes to be available for longer. BBC Trust vice chairman Diane Coyle said in April: 'It is important that iPlayer continues to evolve and meet the expectations of users. 'We have conducted a thorough assessment of these proposals, including taking independent advice from Ofcom, and concluded that this is a sensible move that will benefit audiences and provide a clearer and more consistent catch-up service.' In February, Lord Hall admitted the licence fee needed to be updated to cover iPlayer. He said: 'Our view is that there is room for modernisation so that the fee applies to the consumption of BBC TV programmes, whether live on BBC One or on-demand via BBC iPlayer.'","The availability of shows will no longer be limited to seven days .

"Alex Oxlade Chamberlain remains bullish about his chances of being fit for the World Cup, despite suffering a knee injury in England's draw with Ecuador on Wednesday. The Arsenal midfielder is expected to be sidelined for between 10 days and three weeks to leave boss Roy Hodgson with a difficult decision to make. Oxlade-Chamberlain has a slight strain in his medial ligaments and not a tear. It gives the 20-year-old – who was seen leaving the team hotel for training with his team mates in Miami, with a brace on his right knee. VIDEO: Scroll down for Sportsmail's Neil Ashton's England v Ecuador game report . Worry: Oxlade-Chamberlain was forced into an early exit against Ecuador after picking up a knee injury . Awkward: Ecuador midfielder Carlos Gruezo landed awkwardly on the knee of the midfielder . However, he has not given up hope of featuring in the World Cup. He tweeted: 'Gutted to have picked up an injury yesterday. I'm staying positive and getting to work with the medical team on recovery...Fingers crossed!' England’s first game is on Saturday week against Italy in Manaus but Hodgson must decide whether to gamble on the fitness of a player who has been beset by injuries this season. Concern: Roy Hodgson said it is too early to make a decision on what happens next with Oxlade-Chamberlain . Replacement? Michael Carrick is on the stand-by list for England . Exit: Oxlade-Chamberlain was seen on Wednesday leaving the Sun Life Stadium visibly upset . Despair: The England midfielder will hope his World Cup dream is not over . Blow: Oxlade-Chamberlain looks distraught after suffering an injury against Ecuador . In pain: England players look glum as they surround the hurt Arsenal midfielder . Hurt: Oxlade-Chamberlain will have a scan to check the full extent of the damage . Performed: The youngster put in a terrific performance in Miami before he was forced off . The official England Twitter feed posted: '@Alex_OxChambo sustained a medial knee ligament injury against Ecuador. The team medics are continuing to monitor and treat injury.' Oxlade-Chamberlain suffered a cruciate ligament injury at the start of the season and has been troubled by a groin injury during the final weeks of the season. The game against Ecuador in Miami was his first start for nearly two months but he has been able to complete all the intensive England fitness work since the squad assembled last month. He may lack match sharpness but looked in good touch during the 2-2 draw on Wednesday night. Hodgson may opt to take Oxlade-Chamberlain to Brazil and delay his final decision. The squad lists were lodged with FIFA earlier this week but teams are allowed to make changes if there is a new injury, up 24 hours before their first game. There is nothing to stop the England boss calling in a player who is not on the stand-by list but Hodgson may well turn to Jon Flanagan or John Stones because they have been with the squad for more than two weeks and have done all the acclimatisation training. There appear to be no plans to send him home at the moment.

"It is still more than a year away from a big-screen release, but interest in the new Star Wars movie is already seemingly having an impact on our travel plans. Back with a bang: The three big stars of the original Star Wars film will all feature in the latest movie . New travel figures reveal that a film lovers are apparently booking trips to Abu Dhabi, where portions of the seventh movie in the feted franchise are currently being created. Statistics released by holiday accommodation website LateRooms.com show a 19 per cent increase in hotel reservations for breaks to Dubai’s big Emirati neighbour. Desert delight: Star Wars movies have also been filmed at Ong El Jemel, in Tunisia .

Pieces of movie history: The Sidi Driss Hotel is still visible in Matmata, Tunisia . ‘As one of the biggest film franchises, it is not surprising that Star Wars fans are eager to sneak a glimpse of any filming action they can,’ says Lynda Matthews of LateRooms.com. ‘We would not be surprised to see the bookings continue to rise as fans flock to the desert to combine a short break with a glimpse of Hollywood action.’ The announcement, made in 2012, that three new Star Wars movies will be produced, has further invigorated interest in a franchise that is never short of devotees. Cinematic classics: Remnants of Star Wars sets also linger in the desert at Tozeur in Tunisia . The original Star Wars trilogy dominated cinematic release schedules between 1977 and 1983, and made celebrities of actors like Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill.

"A woman has accused a beauty salon of botching an eyebrow wax, leaving her with two layers of skin torn from her eyelids. Ashley King, from Glendale, Arizona, paid $10 for the wax, only to emerge from the salon with patches of skin missing from raw eyelids and 'bleeding creases.'

"More than 500 surgeries could close in England over the next year because so many GPs are about to retire, senior doctors warn. The Royal College of GPs says that thousands of patients will have to travel to the next town and waiting times at these practices will rise further. Figures from the college identify 543 practices where more than 90 per cent of the GPs are over 60 and likely to retire imminently. But there is a severe shortage of younger doctors to replace them as the career becomes unpopular. More than 500 surgeries could close in England over the next year because so many GPs are about to retire, senior doctors have warned . Earlier this week David Cameron promised everyone would be able to see their family doctor seven days a week by 2020, as long as the Tories are still in power. But senior GPs warned that the plans would not work as there are too few doctors to man surgeries at weekends. Tomorrow college president Dr Maureen Baker will warn that in future practices will have to ‘close their doors’ to patients. Addressing its annual conference in Liverpool, she is expected to say: ‘Every practice closed is a loss to a local community. ‘Not only do patients lose out, but it piles more pressure on neighbouring practices, swelling patient lists already bursting at the seams. ‘With a growing, ageing population, not to mention a baby boom, we need to increase capacity in general practice, not take it away. If this was a business it would be expanding to meet demand – not shutting down services.’ Figures from the college identify 543 practices where more than 90 per cent of the GPs are over 60 and likely to retire imminently; the problem has been worsened by younger GPs quitting to work abroad or re-training in different careers . Normal retirement age in the NHS is 60 but the average for GPs is 59 as many leave early due to the demands of the job. The problem has been worsened by younger GPs quitting to work abroad or re-training in different careers. GPs say they are not being given enough money by the Government to deal with the demands of a rising, ageing population. Some surgeries are so overwhelmed they have begun striking patients off their lists to ease the pressure. Last week Dr Baker admitted waiting times to see a GP were a ‘national disgrace’. Today she will compare GP services to a ‘dam’ that protects hospitals from becoming ‘flooded’ with patients. She will say: ‘So far much of the damage to the dam wall has been hidden from the public – they see the flooding downstream in accident and emergency departments and in hospital pressures, but they haven’t been aware that GPs, nurses and practice teams have been absorbing that pressure by trying to do more and more with less and less. ‘But if we let that situation continue we will see whole chunks of the dam fall apart when practices have to shut their doors.’ Earlier this week Steve Field, of the Care Quality Commission, warned that some surgeries were putting patients at risk due to basic failings. He said standards at 2 per cent of practices – equivalent to 160 surgeries nationwide – were ‘very worrying’.","At 543 practices 90 per cent of the GPs are over 60 and soon to retire .

"Tax cuts for millions of families were yesterday put at the heart of the Tory pitch to win next year’s election. David Cameron electrified his party conference with a dramatic pledge to raise the 40p income tax threshold by more than £8,000 to £50,000 by 2020. This would lift 800,000 out of the higher band altogether, reversing years in which it has sucked in more and more ordinary households. Those earning between £50,000 and £100,000 would pay £1,313 a year less in tax than they do now. Scroll down for video . Promises: David Cameron electrified his party conference with a dramatic pledge to raise the 40p income tax threshold by more than £8,000 to £50,000 by 2020 . Admitting action on the 40p rate was overdue, the Prime Minister also promised another huge increase in the personal allowance, helping 24million basic rate taxpayers. He said the amount on which no tax is paid, currently £10,000, would be increased bit by bit if the Tories stay in office, reaching £12,500 by April 2020. That would save every basic rate taxpayer £500 a year. In a direct appeal to the 30million families who would benefit from the £7.2billion tax commitment, Mr Cameron declared: ‘I want you to take home more of your own money.’ Pledge: Admitting action on the 40p rate was overdue, the Prime Minister also promised another huge increase in the personal allowance, helping 24million basic rate taxpayers .

Iain Duncan Smith, work and pensions secretary and a standard bearer for the Tory right, was seen punching the air in delight as Mr Cameron laid out his plans. Ridiculing Ed Miliband’s failure to mention the budget deficit at the Labour party conference last week, the Prime Minister insisted tax cuts could be delivered only if tough measures were used to bring down public spending. He denounced Labour as ‘this high-spending, high-taxing, deficit-ballooning shower’ and said it would be madness to expect a vote for them in May to end in anything but economic disaster. The tax pledges were the centrepiece of Mr Cameron’s final conference speech before the election – and what could be his last in charge if he loses to Mr Miliband. Applause: Senior Tories including George Osborne, William Hague, Theresa May and Philip Hammond applaud the Premier's speech, while Iain Duncan Smith was seen punching the air in delight . Highlight: The tax pledges were the centrepiece of Mr Cameron’s final conference speech before the election .

But it was the two tax-cutting pledges, which will cost £7.2billion, that were the most significant and audacious. In his 52-minute speech, Mr Cameron also said strong families, reward for hard work and a deep patriotism informed his politics. And he set out what he believed most families aspired to: ‘A good job, a nice home, more money at the end of the month, a decent education for your children, a safe and secure retirement.’ Labour accused the Conservatives of standing up for the privileged few and insisted the party must spell out where the £7.2billion would come from.

United front: Mr Cameron posed for photographs with his wife after his leader's speech went down a storm with the Conservative party faithful . Thumbs up: Mr Cameron appeared to be pleased with how his speech went when he gave this thumbs up gesture to the cheering crowds . Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘David Cameron’s speech showed no recognition that working people are £1,600 a year worse off under the Tories nor that the NHS is going backward on their watch. ‘Nobody will be fooled by pie in the sky promises of tax cuts in six years’ time when David Cameron cannot tell us where the money is coming from.’ Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, also raised doubts about tax cuts when most Whitehall departments are to lose a third of their budgets.

"The end of the Bathurst 1000 matched the day's drama when road repairs to the track halted the race for an hour following a number of high-speed crashes. Just two hours into the great Australian motor race, officials raised the red-flag just after 1pm as the new bitumen at turn two started breaking up heavily, causing a number of accidents at Mount Panorama in NSW on Sunday. Nissan co-driver Taz Douglas went into the wall twice at high-speed corner, with the Fords of Paul Morris and Scott Pye also crashing at the same spot. Lee Holdsworth in the Erebus entry overturned during the 133rd lap of the Bathurst 1000 . With 100 laps to go, the Bathurst 1000 was suspended for one-hour . Spectators took to Twitter to give their commentary on the stoppage at Mt Panorama . The area was filled and sealed with resin before the race resumed . The area was filled and sealed with resin before the race resumed an hour later. In 53 editions of the endurance classic, never has it been restarted after a red-flag. But the drama did not end there, with two more safety cars called in before the midway point of the 161-lap epic. V8 Supercars championship leader Jamie Whincup took out the Nissan of Todd Kelly on the first lap after the restart, for which he copped a drive-through penalty. The two cars were forced back into the pits for some quick repair work on the damage. Again Holdsworth crashed at turn two of the race after the bitumen was repaired by officials . The annual race was halted about 1pm just hours after it started at 10.30am . Whincup had produced the drive before the red flag, managing to climb from 23rd to fifth in just 15 laps and breaking his own race lap record. Soon after his collision with Kelly, Steven Johnson hit a wall and spun his Ford at the top of the hill. His retro-themed No.17 Falcon had to be towed back to the garage. Five laps later, Pye also crashed heavily and wrote off his car - triggering the day's fifth safety car. 'Man, that escalated quickly,' Garth Tander, who was forced to sit out of the race after his wrecked Holden Racing Team Commodore was withdrawn after practice on Saturday, said. In the 133rd lap of the race, Erebus' Lee Holdsworth overturned his car at turn two after clipping Repair Management Australia's Russell Ingall. Ingall was able to drive away while minutes later Holdsworth was seen emerging out of his car. Holden veteran Craig Lowndes had earlier predicted plenty of carnage in the endurance classic given what he had experienced on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The grippy new track surface bit several cars in nearly every practice and qualifying session, including Lowndes. Officials red-flagged the race when a patch of new tarmac at turn two was breaking up heavily . The Bathurst 1000 eventually lasted for seven hours and 58 minutes. This year's became the longest ever, with the previous record being set at seven hours and 50 minutes in 1974. The day came to another dramatic end when Ford's Chaz Mostert and Paul Morris clenched a victory over Holden's Jamie Whincup who ran out of fuel just one kilometre from the finish line. Mostert, 22, who failed to finish on his Bathurst debut last year, and co-driver Morris started last on the grid - the lowest-ever position to win the race. Morris, who started from the back after having been excluded from qualifying for passing a car under red flags, was among the victims of the accidents at turn two on Sunday after he crashed into the wall at high-speed. 'It was a bit scary but it kind of helped us a little bit - all the safety cars got us in position back up there,' Mostert said after the race, which saw a total of eight retirements and 10 safety car interventions. 'From 25th, I never even thought I'd get to the top 10 today. We got the 10 - just without the zero there. 'Who knew we'd go from 25th to first? Next year I might just not even qualify and just save our tyres for the race.' Despite a bright and clear start, a thunderstorm has been forecast for late Sunday afternoon .","Ford's Chaz Mostert and Paul Morris won the 1,000km race at Mt Panorama in NSW .

"Andy, the homeless man who was loved by his community, will forever be remembered as the 'gentle giant'. While his identity remains a mystery, residents were evidently touched by his presence as nearly 200 locals paid their respects at his memorial service on Saturday. The man of few words slept in front of Raine and Horne's real estate agency in Pyrmont but spent his days on a bench in Jacksons Landing - the northern tip of the inner-city surburb - overlooking Sydney Harbour. A homeless man, only known as Andy, died from a suspected heart attack about a month ago in Sydney's inner-city suburb of Pyrmont . This was Andy's favourite spot - Jacksons Landing, the northern tip of Pyrmont which is in Sydney's inner-city suburb . The community felt a sense of loss when Andy died from a suspected heart attack about a month ago . Children left their drawings of Andy at the very place he spent most of his days - his bench overlooking Sydney Harbour . Principal of Raine and Horne Pyrmont, John Ellis, helped fund the service which was held near Andy's bench. 'It was the obvious thing to do - he's human too,' Mr Ellis told Daily Mail Australia. 'He didn't bother the staff at all because he was polite and very respectful. He didn't ask for anything and didn't say much. 'He was a homeless person but he didn't act like one. He never drank, never smoked and just liked to keep to himself and draw in his notepad. He was a gentle giant. 'He didn't make much eye contact and he was quite shy.' Andy, believed to be in his 30s or 40s, died a month ago from a suspected heart attack. Locals will place a plaque at his bench in his honour while a basket hangs from a nearby tree where residents have left behind their tributes. They include children's drawings of Andy enjoying the views of the harbour from his bench. Mr Ellis says Andy had been sleeping outside the Raine and Horne office for about seven years while other locals speculated that he'd lived in the area for more than a decade. A shadow painted on the bench by residents so they can remember where Andy used to sit every day . A memorial service, also organised by residents, was held near Andy's bench on Saturday . Nearly 200 locals paid their respects to the homeless man, who's identity remains a mystery but is believed to be from Queensland . Some say Andy, believed to be in his 30s or 40s, lived in the area for more than a decade . A basket of ribbons hanging from a tree nearby Andy's favourite bench where residents have left tribute messages . Reverend Robin Davies, of Mustard Seed Uniting Church in Ultimo, says there was a huge sense of loss in the community when Andy died. 'There was a great outpouring of grief for Andy because he was part of our community,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'So the memorial service was an opportunity for the locals to express their thoughts. 'I guess some people even felt guilty because he was so young.' Reverend Davies says it is believed that Andy is from Queensland. 'But some people reckon he's lived in the area for 15 years,' she said. 'He seemed to feel at home and quite secure here. He was just quite happy with what he had and people respected and admired him for that. The community accepted him just as he was.' Andy's body remains at a morgue, waiting to be claimed by a relative. However if nobody comes forward, Reverend Davies says the community is willing to cremate him and scatter his ashes into the water in front of his favourite bench. A date for the funeral has not yet been set for Andy.","A memorial service was held for a man, only known as Andy, in Sydney's inner-city suburb of Pyrmont .

"North Korea says the remains of thousands of American soldiers killed during the Korean War are being moved due to construction projects and flood damage. The United States suspended efforts to recover war remains in North Korea over the country's plans to launch a long-range rocket in 2012. About 8,000 U.S. service members are listed as missing from the 1950-53 war. An unidentified North Korean military spokesman said in a statement Monday that American soldiers' remains are 'left here and there uncared and carried away en masse' because of building projects, land reorganization and flood damage. Analysts say the North's statement is aimed at pressuring Washington to resume the recovery project as a way to get money and improve ties with the U.S. Scroll down for video . Where's Kim? North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, 32, hasn't been seen in nearly 40 days, prompting much speculation about the stability of his regieme . North Korean leaders meet in Pyongyang . Meanwhile, South Korea on Monday said it had warned North Korea of a 'strong' response if it provoked an incident similar to one last week that sparked an exchange of machine gun fire across their border. The warning came as South Korean President Park Geun-hye reiterated on Monday her commitment to engage with the North, despite what she called 'the dual nature' of ties, saying the 'door was always open to dialogue.' South Korea said the North Korean firing was a 'provocative act' that had violated the truce suspending their 1950-53 war and the complaint was reiterated in a notice the South sent the North late on Sunday. 'It is a stern warning of a strong response in the event of further provocation,' South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok told a briefing. The exchange of fire on Friday began after North Korea fired shots at balloons carrying leaflets sent towards the North by South Korean activists critical of the North's leadership. North Korea has long criticised the leaflet drops as provocative and it has threatened to respond to them with force. But before Friday, it had never done so. No one was hurt in the firing. North Korea's state media said on Saturday that expected talks with the South to try to improve ties were in danger of being cancelled because authorities in South Korea had allowed the activists to float their balloons. South Korean President Park Geun-hye reiterated Monday her commitment to engage with the North, despite what she called 'the dual nature' of ties, saying the 'door was always open to dialogue' 'The leaflet-scattering operation ... was a premeditated and deliberate politically motivated provocation perpetrated under the backstage wire-pulling of the U.S. and the South Korean authorities,' the North's KCNA news agency said. North Korea sent a high-level delegation on a surprise visit to the South on Oct. 4 and the two sides agreed to reopen dialogue, which has been stalled since February, late this month or early next. Private groups in the South, often led by defectors from the North, cite their constitutional freedom of expression in releasing their balloons. The South's Unification Ministry, which handles relations with the North, repeated on Monday it had no legal justification to stop the leaflet drops but said authorities may try to step in to prevent them on the basis of ensuring public safety.

"Manchester United striker Robin van Persie has warned that recent injury problems will not stop him having a World Cup to remember. Van Persie has disappointed at recent major tournaments and heads in to tomorrow night’s opening Group B game defending champions Spain having recently suffered a groin problem and having escaped with minor cuts following a collision with a kite surfer on a Brazilian beach. But the Old Trafford star claimed today he is ready to go, saying: 'I shouldn't even mention my groin injury, frankly.

'I'm ready for it. Besides, I've been playing six years with aches. There is always something. I've had to learn to do that. 'I'm positive for everything that lies ahead and have faith in our team.' The Dutch are preparing for their final games under coach Louis van Gaal before he leaves to join Van Persie as his new manager at United. Playmaker Wesley Sneijder suggested this week that the Oranje are more together under Van Gaal than they were under Bert van Marwijk when they lost the last World Cup Final to Spain in 2010. And Van Persie struck a similar note ahead of Holland’s official pre-match press conference later today. He said: 'Do not underestimate us, even though Spain are a great team.

"Harvard University is under fire from faculty and students for secretly photographing about 2,000 undergraduates in 10 lecture halls last spring as part of a study on classroom attendance. The experiment was disclosed at a faculty meeting Tuesday and first reported in The Harvard Crimson student newspaper. Harvard computer science professor Harry Lewis asked administrators about the study during the meeting, saying he learned about it from two colleagues. 'You should do studies only with the consent of the people being studied,' Lewis told The Boston Globe on Wednesday. Candid camera: Harvard University has admitted to secretly photographing students in classes in 10 lecture halls, in which more than 2,000 students were enrolled, as part of a study of classroom attendance . Brett Biebelberg, a junior involved in student government, called the study's secretive nature 'strikingly hypocritical', given that the university recently adopted an honor code for the first time. 'Investigating': Harvard President Drew Faust says that she takes this matter 'very seriously' Students and teachers were not notified because researchers did not want to introduce potential bias into the study, Harvard administrators said. The cameras took pictures every minute and a computer program used them to count empty and occupied seats. The study was done by Harvard's Initiative for Learning and Teaching, overseen by Vice Provost Peter Bol, and authorized by the school's Institutional Review Board. Professors whose lectures were monitored were told in August and all gave permission for the data to be used in the study, he said. Students were not told and the images themselves were destroyed, he said. The university said they were not trying to track students. Neither was it meant to monitor the teachers. However it is unclear whether the controversial experiment was meant to do anything other than record attendance. Harvard in March 2013 was criticized for secretly searching the university email accounts of 16 deans to find out who leaked information about a cheating scandal to the media. That led to new privacy policies on electronic communication this past spring. President Drew Faust said she will have the latest case reviewed by a panel that oversees the newly established electronic communications policies. 'I indeed do take very seriously the important questions that this incident raises,' Faust said, according to The Crimson. Campus under fire: The study has drawn criticism from both Harvard students and faculty due to the secretive nature of the recordings . It is the second time in as many days that Harvard has hit headlines. On Wednesday it was revealed the school, which is number two in the nation, offered a seminar on anal sex on Tuesday aimed at promoting a holistic understanding of that specific type of intercourse despite the fact that it is widely considered taboo. The student run workshop called 'What What in the Butt: Anal Sex 101' is a part of Harvard's annual Sex Week, a week of programming meant to help students better understand all its parts, even those less discussed. The course description said that the class will delve into the misunderstandings of anal sex and will be an opportunity for students to ask questions in a safe, comfortable, and knowledgeable environment.","University set up secret camera in 10 lecture halls in spring .

"She's walked the runway for Marc Jacobs, showcased her curves for Agent Provocateur and is part of the new Primrose Hill set, so it comes as little surprise that Daisy Lowe has been snapped up to front a cool new beauty campaign. The young model has been unveiled as the face of Rodial's makeup range - the UK's first specific sculpting and contouring collection - and proves her worth in the campaign shots. The 25-year-old was chosen by the brand thanks to her 'modern, cool and quintessentially British edge.' So how does she feel about her new coup and what are the secrets behind her flawless look? FEMAIL caught up with the young star to discover her style and beauty secrets. New face: Daisy Lowe has been unveiled as the new face of Rodial's debut makeup range, which is dedicated to contouring and sculpting . 'I am so excited about my new campaign,' she told us. 'I have always been a huge fan of Rodial and I was lucky enough to be honoured with their Woman of the Year award earlier this year, which was a total shock and really surreal. 'I was flattered to be asked to get on board and I love the range so it was the perfect match.' The new makeup, which lands in Harvey Nichols on November 7,  is a capsule range of pieces designed to sculpt and define the face for a natural, flawless and radiant look. 'It's a fail safe range,' says Daisy. 'You just have to learn where to place the contouring. My top tip is: suck in your cheeks and make a fish face, which casts a natural shadow on your face. 'Then apply the bronzer over that shadow and then pop the highlighter above that.' Get the look: The new makeup is a capsule range of pieces designed to sculpt and define the face for a natural, flawless and radiant look, as showcased by Daisy . Hand-picked: Founder of Rodial, Maria Hatzistefanis, awarded Daisy with Woman of the Year at the Rodial Beautiful Awards earlier this year and loves her cool, edgy flair so asked her to front the new beauty campaign . After years on the modelling circuit, Daisy says the top tip she's picked up is using concealer around her nose to even the skin tone. 'Oh, and make your forehead and chin a lighter shade than the rest of your face for a more defined look,' she said. The model - who is the daughter of Pearl Lowe and Gavin Rossdale - cites Katharine Hepburn and Brigitte Bardot as her 'non fictional' style icons and Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With The Wind as her fictional one. 'Scarlett is amazing, the absolute dream. Her face of just ridiculous,' she said. Daisy, who describes her personal style as 'Parisian chic with a naughty London twist, says she loves toughening up a grown up dress with grungy Dr. Martens to 'stay true to her Camden roots.' Friends in high places: Fashion models Suki Waterhouse, Daisy Lowe, Clara Paget and Cara Delevingne attend Ambassador Barzun, Mrs Brooke Barzun and Alexandra Shulman's celebration of London Fashion Week . Inspired by the 30s and 70s, she loves creations by Christopher Kane, Erdem and Saint Laurent and says online shopping at Topshop and Reformation is 'lethal'. No wonder Daisy has such good style - she has best pal and fashion's darling Alexa Chung to share style secrets with. Whilst Alexa, who is known for her famous feline flick and recently unveiled her own eye makeup range, has never given Daisy any beauty tips, the model says her friend is 'amazing' at doing makeup. Fashion family: The model - who is the daughter of Pearl Lowe, pictured, and Gavin Rossdale - cites Katharine Hepburn and Brigitte Bardot as her style icons . Daisy may have just been named as the new face of Rodial, but she's also been very busy with other projects. Recently, the in-demand brunette was unveiled as the new face of US clothing brand American Eagle Outfitters. And, as well as her modelling duties, earlier this year the baking enthusiast released a recipe book entitled Sweetness and Light, a collection of recipes for 60 healthy sweet treats. By making simple changes to ingredients, such as using maple syrup rather than refined sugar, or discovering new ingredients like raw chocolate, Daisy promises that her recipes are transformed into something 'devilishly delicious' but 'angelically healthy'. 'I just love cooking,' she told us. 'In the future I want to do more cooking, shooting campaigns and see the world. 'In five years time I want to continue doing loads of fashion stuff and be happy with a big smile on my face.' Best friends: Daisy, pictured, left, with Alexa Chung and, right, with Nick Grimshaw, wants to travel the world and continue working in fashion . With such a positive attitude to life, it's no wonder founder of Rodial, Maria Hatzistefanis, snapped her up. She said: ‘I first met Daisy when she attended our Rodial awards where she won Woman of the Year. I was impressed by her effortless natural beauty, style and radiance. 'What Daisy can bring to the Rodial brand is a modern, cool and quintessentially British edge.’ From the £52 illuminating powder to the £34 eye sculpt, each of the new products have been designed to contour and sculpt your face. The powders are opalescent, which is designed to highlight facial features with an illuminating gleam and the universal champagne tone aims to add a candle-lit glow to the skin. The powders have micronization technology and fine pearls in the formula, which apparently gives the skin a silky texture and ensures even application. The eye products have been made with a mousse-like texture, which, say the makers, can be built from a natural enhancement to a deeper sculpted frame, creating looks from day to night. There's also a £24 tinted cream that adds a flush of colour to the cheeks to give a long-wearing healthy glow and is filled with hyaluronic acid, which promises to plump skin whilst the coral shade adds a subtle rosy colour to the apple of the cheeks. If you want to try before you buy, Harvey Nichols will be opening a sculpting bar, where beauty fans can test out the products.

"Alastair Cook stood in disbelief after . rocking back to play his favoured pull but only succeeded in bottom . edging Dhammika Prasad and seeing the ball cannon into his stumps. It . was the lowest point of the worst day of his captaincy. When . Cook was churning out hundred after hundred he would simply have . despatched the ball to the boundary but now, woefully out of form and . fighting for his captaincy life, even the shot that has earned him a . huge chunk of his 8,000 plus Test runs had badly let him down. VIDEO Scroll down to watch reaction to day four from Ian Bell . Day to remember: Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews celebrates passing 100 on the way to scoring 160 . Cook was gone for 16, Gary Ballance followed next ball and England began crashing in the most demoralised, shambolic manner possible to the unheralded talents of a 31-year-old journeyman in Prasad, who took four prime wickets. When nightwatchman Liam Plunkett tamely lobbed Rangana Herath to cover off what became the last ball of the day England’s misery was almost complete. At 57 for five chasing a massive 350 to win this second Test and the Investec series they face a humiliating and hugely damaging defeat. There were many dark days during a winter when England were taken apart by Australia but this is surely as bad as it can get for a captain who survived the mass cull that greeted a 5-0 Ashes whitewash. Disappointment: Captain Alastair Cook failed again as he was bowled for 16 in the second innings . A two-Test home series against Sri Lanka . was meant to provide a gentle start to the new era, a chance for England . to regroup and for Cook to prove that he can mould a team in his image . and lead England forward positively. Instead, barring a miracle even . beyond 1981 on this ground, it will turn into Sri Lanka’s historic . first Test series win in England to complete a clean sweep after their . victories in the Twenty20 international and the one-day series. That . will be a crushing blow for England’s new regime, not least a captain in . Cook who will now go into a high profile series against India under . enormous pressure. If he gets that far. It is not inconceivable, with . England a rabble under his leadership on Monday, that Cook will now fall . on his sword. Setback: England's Ian Bell was quickly sent back to the pavilion . England have invested hugely in Cook and will . unquestionably want to give him a lot more time than this but to be . outclassed by Sri Lanka and their supposedly pop gun attack at home will . seriously test the ECB's loyalty and belief. Remember, England . dominated the bulk of the first two days of this Test having come within . one wicket of winning the first but the transformation since England . were coasting at 311 for three in reply to Sri Lanka’s 257 has been . total. Sri Lanka, supposedly the warm-up for the main Indian act, . have been sensational under their highly impressive captain in Angelo . Mathews and have proved their quality and toughness here but there is no . excuse for England. Got him: England's Gary Balance was trapped LBW without scoring . They were pathetic from the moment . Cook allowed Sri Lanka to milk another 40 runs from the remaining seven . overs with the old ball without looking to take wickets to the bitter . end with Plunkett’s comical demise. There can be no sparing of a . captain who lacked any sense of tactical acumen in the field while his . opposite number scored his second consecutive hundred and then carried . on his long spell without a century of his own.

Most baffling was Cook’s refusal to . turn to Moeen Ali for the bulk of that stand between lunch and tea even . though he had taken the wickets of two key left-handers on Sunday and . was facing a third in Herath who has a history of swishing at . off-spinners. Instead Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, who will be . crucial when England face those five Tests in six weeks against India, . were flogged into the ground while Chris Jordan struggled to make an . impact in his second Test. Impressive: England paceman Liam Plunkett finished with math haul of nine wickets . England, who squandered seven chances . in the Sri Lankan first innings and another crucial one at the start of . their second, were again culpable in their own demise, . dropping three more chances and wasting their two reviews. Most . crucial was Plunkett spilling Mathews on 87 off his own bowling while . England’s lack of judgment over reviews was exposed when umpire Billy .

"This is the hilarious moment a polar bear cub belly flopped into icy water in a failed attempt to catch its lunch. Instead of diving gracefully, the two-year-old was seen suspended in mid-air before face-planting  with such force that his prey was scared into hiding.

Realising his embarrassing mistake, the polar bear then re-surfaced without catching any food and held onto an ice float . Polar bears are the largest land carnivores in the world, rivaled only by the Kodiak brown bears of southwestern Alaska. They spend much of their time on Arctic sea ice, so their fur is thicker than any other bears' and covers even their feet for warmth and traction on ice. A thick layer of blubber beneath their fur provides buoyancy and insulation. The long neck and narrow skull of the polar bear probably aid in streamlining the animal in the water while warming the air that they breathe, and their front feet are large, flat and oar-like, making them excellent swimmers. Polar bears feed almost exclusively on ringed seals and bearded seals. They are also known to eat walrus,beluga whale and bowhead whale carcasses, birds' eggs, and (rarely) vegetation.

"A teenager charged with stabbing 20 students and a security guard at his high school was motivated by the Columbine massacre, according to an expert witness today. Psychologist Bruce Chambers, who was hired by the defense team, testified on Friday that 16-year-old Alex Hribal  planned the stabbing for April 20, the 15th anniversary of the massacre, but school was out that day. Instead, Chambers said, the youth brought two 8-inch kitchen knives to Franklin Regional High School in Pennsylvania on April 9, the birthday of Eric Harris, one of the two Columbine shooters. Alex Hribal was led out by sheriffs after being placed under arrest for going on a stabbing spree at his Pennsylvania high school on April 9 - a day he allegedly picked as an homage to Columbine shooter Eric Harris as it was his birthday . The hearing will determine whether Hribal will be moved from a juvenile detention center to a mental health facility. His lawyer has acknowledged Hribal committed the crimes but said questions remain about his ability to recognize the seriousness and wrongfulness of his actions. The attack occurred minutes before the start of classes at Franklin Regional High School on April 9. Hribal is charged with 21 counts of attempted homicide and aggravated assault and one count of possessing weapons on school property. Students at Franklin Regional High School were evacuated after the stabbing on April 9 which left 20 students and security guard injured . His attorney, Patrick Thomassey, doesn't dispute that Hribal brought two eight-inch kitchen knives from his home and attacked others before classes began that morning. Hribal, 16, is charged with 21 counts of attempted homicide . But Thomassey maintains the boy has deep-seated mental health issues that would be better addressed in juvenile court. Thomassey has said he plans to ask a judge to move the case from Common Pleas to juvenile court, where the judge would be able to incarcerate or supervise Hribal only until he's 21. If he's convicted as an adult, he would likely face decades in prison. Prosecutors are expected to argue that Hribal should continue to be treated as an adult. Hribal's trial had been scheduled to begin October 6, but was postponed indefinitely to resolve some legal issues. During the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, Dylan Klebold and fellow senior student Eric Harris killed 12 students and one teacher and injured 26 others  before taking their own lives. The large-scale attack also involved a fire bomb used to distract fire fighters. At the time, it was the worst school shooting in the country's history before in 2012, shooter Adam Lanzo killed 20 students and six teaching staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

"A Lidl worker who was bullied out of his job after complaining about mouldy food on the shelves is set to receive more than £10,000. Matthew O’Donnell, 28, alerted managers after he spotted defrosted and ‘degenerated’ items on sale. He claimed the stock had been compromised after the fridges and freezers were turned off for more than four hours for maintenance during a heatwave. Scroll down for video . Matthew O'Donnell is set to receive thousands after a tribunal judge ruled he had been unfairly treated after reporting mouldy and defrosted food at Lidl in Hanham, Bristol . The chilled and frozen items were still on sale the next day at the store in Bristol, and Mr O’Donnell said customers were specifically directed towards them to ‘maximise consumption’. At work that day, he claimed he also spotted mouldy produce in the fruit and vegetable section. But when he complained, he was subjected to ‘a campaign of victimisation and harassment’ and forced to resign from his job. Mr O’Donnell took the company to an employment tribunal where a judge ruled he had suffered detriment or dismissal for exercising his rights. Yesterday, Mr O’Donnell hailed his win as a victory for the public and said he hoped it would encourage other whistleblowers to speak out. Mr O'Donell will receive damages of more than £10,000 to cover the loss of his job . He will receive damages of more than £10,000 to cover the loss of his job and the bullying he faced. He is also claiming for anxiety and depression, after representing himself against a top London lawyer in proceedings which dragged on for almost a year. The tribunal in Bristol heard Mr O’Donnell began working at the city’s Hanham store on June 8 last year. He described how, during a night shift on July 7, a contractor began upgrading the shop’s electrics and the power was switched off for more than four hours. When he went to work the next day he found products ‘seriously degenerated’ four days prior to their use-by date, and mould in the fruit and vegetable section. Mr O’Donnell sent a report to senior managers, believing he would be protected under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. He told bosses he felt he would be responsible if anything happened to customers. But Mr O’Donnell, from Kingswood, Bristol, said his initial complaints were dismissed by store manager Krzysztof Golanski, who threatened him about his job. He was warned not to ‘embarrass’ the store, soon finding himself taken off certain shifts. The situation became so bad he felt forced to hand in his notice on September 9. Judge Michael Ford QC ruled that he lost his job because he spoke out. The judge added: ‘The claimant, we consider, made an entirely proper and legitimate disclosure about a serious threat to health and safety.’ Lidl spokesman Georgina O’Donnell said: ‘We accept the decision of the tribunal and we will remain vigilant to ensure that the appropriate processes are duly followed in future.’ A spokesman for Lidl said it accepted the tribunal's decision and will work to 'ensure the appropriate processes are duly followed in future'","Matthew O'Donnell noticed mouldy vegetables and fruit on display July .

"Nasa is making final preparations for a once-in-a-million-years journey as a comet grazes the atmosphere of Mars on Sunday. Comet C/2013 A1, also known as comet Siding Spring, will pass within about 87,000 miles (139,500 kilometers) of the Red Planet on Sunday - less than half the distance between Earth and our moon, and less than one-tenth the distance of any known comet flyby of Earth. Researchers say it will provide an unprecedented opportunity to gather data on both the comet and its effect on the Martian atmosphere. Scroll down for video . An artist's concept of Comet Siding Spring (2013 A1) and Mars. Closest approach to Mars is on October 19, 2014. Spacecraft will collect in a 'duck and cover' move to avoid dust from the comet . Nasa's five robotic explorers at Mars - three orbiters and two rovers - are being repurposed to witness a comet named Siding Spring make its first known visit to the inner solar system. So are a European and an Indian spacecraft circling the red planet. The orbiting craft will attempt to observe the incoming iceball, then hide behind Mars for protection from potentially dangerous dusty debris in the comet tail. Shielded by the Martian atmosphere, the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers may well have the best seats in the house, although a dust storm on Mars could obscure the view. 'Think about a comet that started its travel probably at the dawn of man and it's just coming in close now,' said Carey Lisse, a senior astrophysicist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, in a NASA news briefing about Comet Siding Spring last week. 'And the reason we can actually observe it is because we have built satellites and rovers. We've now got outposts around Mars.' Siding Spring's nucleus will come closest to Mars around 11:27 a.m. PDT (2:27 p.m. EDT), hurtling at about 126,000 mph (56 kilometers per second). This proximity will provide an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to gather data on both the comet and its effect on the Martian atmosphere. 'This is a cosmic science gift that could potentially keep on giving, and the agency's diverse science missions will be in full receive mode,' said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. 'This particular comet has never before entered the inner solar system, so it will provide a fresh source of clues to our solar system's earliest days.' NASA's five robotic explorers at Mars - three orbiters and two rovers - are being repurposed to witness a comet named Siding Spring make its first known visit to the inner solar system. So are a European and an Indian spacecraft circling the red planet. The orbiting craft will attempt to observe the incoming iceball, then hide behind Mars for protection from potentially dangerous dusty debris in the comet tail. Shielded by the Martian atmosphere, the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers may well have the best seats in the house, although a dust storm on Mars could obscure the view. Nasa's Mars orbiters lining up behind Mars for their 'duck and cover' maneuver to shield them from comet dust that may result from the close flyby of Comet Siding Spring (C/2013 A1) on Oct. 19, 2014. 'We certainly have fingers crossed for the first images of a comet from the surface of another world,' said NASA program scientist Kelly Fast. Spacecraft farther afield, including the Hubble Space Telescope, already are keeping a sharp lookout, as are ground observatories and research balloons. 'We're getting ready for a spectacular set of observations,' said Jim Green, head of NASA's planetary science division. Named for the Australian observatory used to detect it in January 2013, Siding Spring will approach Mars from beneath and zoom right in front Sunday afternoon, Eastern Time. On Earth, the best viewing, via binoculars or telescope, will be from the Southern Hemisphere - South Africa and Australia will be in prime position. In the Northern Hemisphere, it will be difficult to see Siding Spring slide by Mars. The comet - with a nucleus estimated to be at least a half-mile in diameter - hails from the Oort Cloud on the extreme fringe of the solar system. It formed during the first million or two years of the solar system's birth 4.6 billion years ago and, until now, ventured no closer to the sun than perhaps the orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus or Neptune. It comes around every one or more million years. It will be the first Oort Cloud comet to be studied up close in detail. For comparison, the flyby distance of 87,000 miles is about one-third of the way from here to the moon. Siding Spring's tail could extend from Earth all the way to our moon. Its gaseous coma, the fuzzy head surrounding the nucleus, might stretch halfway to the moon. No comet has come anywhere near this close to Earth in recorded history. 'We can't get to an Oort Cloud comet with our current rockets ... so this comet is coming to us,' said Carey Lisse, senior astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University's applied physics laboratory. By studying Siding Spring's composition and structure, scientists hope to learn more about how the planets formed, according to Lisse. Comet Siding Spring comes from the Oort Cloud, material left over from the formation of the solar system. 'This comet is coming into the solar system straight from the Oort Cloud. It's likely this is its first time this close to the sun,' said space scientist David Humm, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. Oort Cloud material, including comets, is scattered through a vast region that begins outside the orbits of Neptune and Pluto and extends a substantial fraction of the distance to Proxima Centauri, the closest neighboring star. Oort Cloud comets can tell scientists about the materials - including water and carbon compounds - that existed during the formation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. The images above show -- before and after filtering -- comet C/2013 A1, also known as Siding Spring, as captured by Wide Field Camera 3 on NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Studying this close encounter will be the largest fleet of orbiting scientific observatories ever flown to another world, orbiting around (and rolling on the ground of) Mars. These instruments will, for the first time ever, have the chance to make close-up observations of a comet new to the inner solar system. And though it will not be the easiest task, the teams operating these instruments and spacecraft have developed plans to take advantage of this rare opportunity. Siding Spring is small (the nucleus is less than a mile in diameter) and fast (it will pass Mars at about 34 miles per second). CRISM, HiRISE, and CTX were built to study a slowly-moving planet, so they will use MRO's ability to rotate in order to capture images as the comet speeds by Mars. The instruments will observe the comet repeatedly for two and a half days as it gets closer and closer to Mars before it makes its closest approach. The peak density of comet dust at Mars is expected 98 minutes after closest approach of the nucleus, and the MRO spacecraft will position itself behind the planet at that time. How graphic shows the science observations that may be captured by NASA Mars spacecraft during the close encounter with Comet Siding Spring (C/2013 A1). Scientists also are keen to spot any changes to the comet or Mars due to the close approach. NASA's newly arrived Maven spacecraft, for instance, will compare the upper atmosphere before and after it passes. 'Think about a comet that started its travel probably at the dawn of man and it's just coming in close now,' Lisse said. 'And the reason we can actually observe it is because we have built satellites and rovers. 'We've now got outposts around Mars.' Scientists initially worried the spacecraft orbiting Mars would be at considerable risk from the comet's massive trail of dust. The nucleus itself poses no danger of impact. But the particles in the tail, hurtling through space at 126,000 mph could fry electronics, puncture fuel lines, or destroy computers, transmitters or other vital spacecraft parts. This graphic depicts the orbit of comet C/2013 A1 Siding Spring as it swings around the sun in 2014. As Siding Spring's path became clearer, the threat level was deemed minimal. Still, space agencies are taking no chances. They're employing the 'duck and cover' strategy. NASA's three orbiters - Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and newcomer Maven - will be behind the red planet at the time of peak danger. That's a 20-minute-or-so period approximately 1 1/2 hours after the closest approach by the comet's nucleus. The European Space Agency also shifted the orbit of its Mars Express as did India for its Mars Orbiter Mission, or MOM, the country's first interplanetary spacecraft that, like NASA's Maven, arrived last month. The precautions are prudent, said University of Maryland senior research scientist Tony Farnham, who led a hazard-analysis team. 'Comets are complex beasts and don't always live up to our predictions,' Farnham said in an email Wednesday. 'If you don't want surprises, then don't study comets.' It will take at least a few days to obtain and analyze the best spacecraft data; but images made from Earth should be forthcoming pretty quickly. Siding Spring should pass closest to the sun six days after its Mars flyby, then swing back out, bidding goodbye, for at least another million years. NASA's Mars orbiters will gather information before, during and after the flyby about the size, rotation and activity of the comet's nucleus, the variability and gas composition of the coma around the nucleus, and the size and distribution of dust particles in the comet's tail. On Oct. 19, the comet will have a very close pass at Mars, just 82,000 miles (132,000 kilometers) from the planet. Observations of the Martian atmosphere are designed to check for possible meteor trails, changes in distribution of neutral and charged particles, and effects of the comet on air temperature and clouds. MAVEN will have a particularly good opportunity to study the comet, and how its tenuous atmosphere, or coma, interacts with Mars' upper atmosphere. Earth-based and space telescopes, including NASA's iconic Hubble Space Telescope, also will be in position to observe the unique celestial object. The agency's astrophysics space observatories -- Kepler, Swift, Spitzer, Chandra -- and the ground-based Infrared Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea, Hawaii -- also will be tracking the event.","Comet Siding Spring, will pass within about 87,000 miles (139,500 kilometers) of the red planet .

"Neymar made a blistering start to his World Cup on Thursday night with a double against Croatia - but UK broadcaster ITV have been forced to apologise after their online service stopped as the 22-year-old scored his second goal from the penalty spot.

"A man has pleaded not guilty to the death and dismemberment of a stripper he knew in New Orleans' French Quarter. Terry Speaks, 42, and his girlfriend Margaret Sanchez, 30, are charged with second-degree murder after allegedly stabbing 22-year-old Jaren Lockhart in the back during a 'private party' at their apartment.

He is pictured returning to New Orleans to appear in court after serving a two-year jail term for an unrelated sex offense in New York . Today, Speaks appeared in Jefferson Parish court days after completing a two-year sentence in a New York federal prison for an unrelated sexual offense. Speaks spoke only to deny the charges of murder and obstruction of justice, which were brought against him by a grand jury three months ago, NOLA reported. He also is charged with failure to register as a sex offender in Jefferson Parish after being convicted in North Carolina in 2003 of having sex with a minor.

"Liverpool have been told they can sign Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno - as long as they meet the club's asking price. The club's president Jose Castro confirmed that Brendan Rogers' side are one of several teams interested in signing the highly-rated 21-year-old, but explained that serious negotiations were yet to begin while emphasising that Sevilla were under no pressure to cash in on the Spain international. 'It's true that there is interest from a number of clubs, above all Liverpool, in him, but we haven't had proper conversations about selling him,' Castro said in an interview with Spanish newspaper ABC.

'He's a player of such quality and importance to the club, the captain of the team, and when we meet with him we made a superhuman effort to keep him, offering him a contract that was unusual for a club like this one. 'He decided he wanted to go elsewhere, and it did not go the way we wanted it too, because the negotiations could have been done differently.

"A luxurious riverside mansion on the Sunshine Coast has taken out three national design prizes including the top award, the National Building Design of the Year. The River House at the Sunshine Coast in Queensland also won in two other national categories set out by the National Association of Building Designers, including Best New Residential Design – over $1 million construction cost and Best Residential Interiors Design. Gerard Smith, the two-storey home's principle designer from Gerard Smith Designs, said it was the cohesiveness of the layout plan that helped it win. Scroll down for video . The River House at Queensland's Sunshine Coast has been named the National Building Design of the Year . The luxurious house also won two other national categories set out by the National Association of Building Designers . 'It was a well-considered design for a complex building with meticulous detail and everything was well considered – that in its entirety appealed to the judges' Mr Smith told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's an open plan home that is designed to take full advantage of the beauty of the site and the river views - the conditions of the site and its own particular location really dictated the layout.' While the owners of the home have chosen to keep their name and address anonymous in order to avoid unexpected visitors, Mr Smith did confirm that the magnificent white household is owned by a family with three young children. 'The family home has been designed with the current family requirements in mind – they have young children, but also so that it can grow and cater for changing family needs,' he said. They included the Best New Residential Design – over $1 million construction cost and Best Residential Interiors Design . The five bedroom family home features an open-plan living design for its kitchen, living and dining areas . Its other features include an external fireplace, a scullery and internal courtyard, a spa and water feature . The five bedroom house with an open plan kitchen living and dining room includes a number of luxurious features including an external fireplace, a scullery, an internal courtyard, a 25 metre lap pool with an infinity edge that connects to the river as well as a spa and water feature. No riverside mansion would be complete without its own jetty and pontoon, both of which the contemporary home boasts. Among the more lavish features, the master bedroom has been designed with its own 'parents retreat' according to Mr Smith, who said it includes a concealed kitchenette, balconies with long water views and a raised bath tub that takes full advantage of the view. The 25 metre lap pool with an infinity edge runs straight up to the river, while the property also boasts its own jetty and pontoon . The master bedroom has been designed with its own 'parent's retreat' which includes a concealed kitchenette, balconies with water views . The 'parent's retreat' also has its own ensuite which includes a raised bath tub that takes full advantage of the view . For the children, a kid's play zone has been worked into the design with an external playground featuring a dry river bed and a sand pit made with natural stone. Designing a home deemed to have the best design in the country is not quick feat however, with Mr Smith revealing it took three years for the house to be completed. 'From the start of the conception to completion of the build, it took approximately three years, so it was quite an extensive project. With the design – you refine and start documenting everything,' he said.

"England have got to play keep ball . England played well on Saturday and it was good to see them going for it in attack, but I still worry that we don’t keep the ball well enough. The stats say England completed 91 per cent of their passes, but everything was done at 100mph. As a neutral that’s great because it makes for exciting, end-to-end stuff but it’s impossible to keep up that tempo in the heat. When you do lose possession against a side as good on the ball as Italy, you end up chasing shadows. By the end of the match England players were on the floor with cramp. You didn’t see any Italians going down exhausted. That’s because they know how to take the sting out of a game. When they need to they make simple passes so the players can grab a breather. Until England learn to do that, we will still struggle against the very best sides. Struggling: Giorgio Chiellini and Claudio Marchisio help Raheem Sterling after he goes down with cramp in the latter stages of England's defeat to Italy . Wilting in the heat: Wayne Rooney throws water over his face to cool down in the hot conditions of Manaus . England’s options for a perfect 10 . This week, Roy Hodgson will have to make the biggest managerial call of his England career: who should he play at number 10 against Uruguay? There will be a clamour for Roy to drop Wayne Rooney but Uruguay would be delighted if he was not on the team-sheet. They will have a second-string right back after Maxi Pereira got sent off so why not put Raheem Sterling out there? He is excellent in the middle but just as comfortable playing wide. Rooney’s best position is through the middle, not out on the left. Defensive duties: Rooney attempts to block a cross by the impressive Antonio Candreva but Italy held the upper hand on that flank for much of the match . In Sterling and Ross Barkley, England have two unique players. Sterling can play anywhere and even though he didn’t have many minutes, Barkley came on and did well cutting inside. Roy has plenty of options but Rooney is wasted on the wings. If he does change it, then Danny Welbeck could be the one to be sacrificed. There’s no doubt he works hard for the team but he doesn’t create enough. I’d like to see more from him if he still plays. Sacrifice: Danny Welbeck could be the one to make way when England play Uruguay on Thursday . Perfection from Pirlo . 95.4% - Pirlo's pass completion rate against England in Manaus, the best of any midfielder on the pitch. Andrea Pirlo is my kind of midfielder — he really is the conductor of the orchestra.  He might be 35 but Pirlo glides across the pitch and makes time stand still when he’s on the ball. He dominated England at EURO 2012 with 114 passes before killing them off with his chipped penalty. He was at it again on Saturday. In Manaus he ‘only’ managed 103 passes but it was always the right one. Wherever he is on the pitch Italy look to him because they know he will keep possession and give them all a breather. He is a joy to watch and you’d love to have an Englishman like him, but players like Pirlo don’t come along very often. Midfield masters: England captain Steven Gerrard congratulates Italy's Andrea Pirlo after the match . Sturridge showing a killer instinct . For 70 minutes against Italy, Daniel Sturridge was causing their defence all sorts of problems. He really he can scare opposition defences with his movement. He always wants to dribble at people with pace, which is terrifying for any defender but he gets into good positions, too. Just look at his finish for England’s goal. It was a great move, started by Sterling’s wonderful pass — he’s more than just a dribbler — and set up by Rooney. It was England at their very best. Better form: Sturridge continued his scoring streak this season when he converted Rooney's cross on 37 minutes . Inch-perfect: Rooney's cross was right on the boot of Sturridge to turn home and bring England level at 1-1 .

"Kim Jong-Un's recent weight loss came in handy at his latest public appearance, allowing him to squeeze into the cockpit of a fighter jet. The North Korean dictator was pictured being shown the controls of the aircraft during an air force drill at an undisclosed location. The tyrant was then pictured laughing jovially with officials, with the plane and a camouflaged military vehicle in the background. Scroll down for video . Kim Jong-Un was shown the controls of a fighter jet during an air force drill at an undisclosed location in the latest official propaganda released this week . The images mark a return to normal for North Korea's popaganda machine, which routinely features the despot visiting sporting and cultural events around the country and military and government installations meant to underscore the leader's control and show the country as prosperous and happy. Kim disappeared from the country's official media for about six weeks, triggering a frenzy of speculation among North Korea watchers who analyse the tiniest details for clues to what is going on in the isolationist state. South Korea's sky agency unveiled its theory for Kim's absence this week. The National Intelligence Service told legislators on Tuesday a foreign doctor had operated on Kim in September or October to remove a cyst from his left ankle, lawmaker Shin Kyung-min said. He said the agency also told lawmakers the cyst could recur because of Kim's obesity, smoking and heavy public schedule. After last being seen in state media on September 3, Kim reappeared on October 14 hobbling with a cane, but smiling and looking thinner. Jovial: The tyrant was pictured laughing with officials and carrying a walking cane at the air force drill . The speculation about Kim's absence was particularly intense because of the potential implications for the long-running standoff between the international community and North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. Meanwhile, it emerged that ten senior members of North Korea’s ruling party have been executed after they were caught watching soap operas. The officials were killed on the order of Kim, taking the number of senior government and military members executed this year to 50, South Korea's intelligence agency have said. The ten were ‘executed by firing squad for watching South Korean soap operas, bribery or womanising,' the agency said. The latest photo-op came as reports emerged of 10 ruling party members being executed for watching South Korean soap operas . Pirate copies of South Korean and Chinese television programmes are widely available and traded on the black market in North Korea, The Telegraph reports. Details on the executions were provided by the intelligence service in a report to the South Korean parliament on Tuesday, Yonhap News told the paper. Kim Jong-Un’s father, Kim Jong-Il and grandfather Kim Il-Sung, fiercely protected the population of North Korea from any foreign or modern influences. The family has ruled the country since it was formed in 1948 at the inconclusive end to the Korean War. Smiling dictator: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un attends a women's football match in Pyongyang . The women's football game took place just weeks after a key official for 'sport programmes' went missing . However, Kim has struggled to shield the North Koreans as mobile phones and the internet has blurred borders. Last week, South Korean media reported that six officials - including the minister of mail and telecommunications, the commanding officer of North Korea's air force and a key official in the North's sport programmes - have not been present at a series of important events in recent months. An intelligence source told South Korea's renowned JoongAng Ilbo newspaper that 'six minister-level officials were executed'. If true, it would be the third major purge since the dictator Kim assumed power in 2011. A view shows spectators at the remodelled May Day Stadium in Pyongyang, during the football . This comes a day after North Korea held talks with a UN human rights investigator for first the first time in ten years. UN human rights chief Marzuki Darusman said he was surprised and gratified that North Korean officials had raised the possibility of allowing him to visit their country during their meeting. But he said the prospect of such a trip remains deeply uncertain because leader Kim Jong Un was insisting that he drop moves in a UN resolution to prosecute the country at the International Criminal Court.over its human rights record. A U.N. Commission of Inquiry report, published in February, detailed wide-ranging abuses, including the use of prison camps, torture, starvation and killings comparable to Nazi-era atrocities.","North Korean dictator pictured being shown the controls of a fighter jet .

Lennon stepped down as Celtic boss in May after four years in charge at the Glasgow club. During his time in the Celtic Park hotseat he guided them to three league titles and two Scottish Cups. The SPFL triumph was the club's third in a row as they finished on 99 points - a staggering 29 ahead of second-place Motherwell. He also led them into the Champions League last 16, where they famously beat then champions Barcelona 2-1 at home in their group stage November 2012. As a player he joined the Bhoys in 2000 and was a key member of the side for seven years during a trophy-laden spell. Lennon's replacement Ronny Deila will hope to replicate his success with Norwegian outfit Stromsgodset at the club.

Liverpool thought they had thrashed out terms with the La Liga side, who have upped their asking price and are now demanding around £20million for the 21-year-old. That means Rodgers could turn his attention to Swiss international Rodriguez instead. The Reds were linked with the 21-year-old in January, but could reignite their interest if a deal for Moreno falls through.

"Spain's stunning early exit from the World Cup sent shock waves through the football world, and leading Spanish newspaper Marca have labelled it 'The End'. After winning Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012, Spain's reign at the top of world football came to a crashing halt after their second straight defeat in Group B in Brazil.

"From the Zara cornflower blue dress she wore after announcing her engagement to the vibrant pink jeans she wore to play hockey in ahead of London's Olympics, whatever the Duchess of Cambridge wears generally turns to retail gold. Her wardrobe choices used to send high street sales soaring with shoppers desperate to emulate her impeccable style. But is the 32-year-old losing her touch? Seemingly so, if the latest research is anything to go by. According to a new survey women are more likely to copy reality TV stars such as Made In Chelsea's Binky Felstead, TOWIE's Lauren Pope and Jersey Shore's Snooki than the once-favoured royal. Scroll down for video . Are we over her? A new piece of research reveals that the 'Kate effect' isn't as strong as it once was and women are more influenced by reality TV stars when it comes to fashion . So is the Kate effect over? Apparently so, according to Jeetendr Sehdev, a celebrity branding expert and University of Southern California marketing professor writing for WWD. He found that movie stars, musicians, models and reality TV stars yield greater influence when it comes to fashion than the former Kate Middleton. According to his research, women in both the USA and the UK claim to be more influenced by reality TV stars, including the Kardashians, as well as Taylor Swift, Sienna Miller and Michelle Obama. Kate who? The survey found that Lauren Pope, left, from The Only Way is Essex, and Binky Felstead, right, from Made in Chelsea, scored higher as fashion influencers . First lady of fashion: According to his research, women in both the USA and the UK claim to be more influenced by the likes of Michelle Obama, left, and Taylor Swift, right . So influential is the First Lady that she has 11 times more selling power than the Duchess. Speaking about his results, Sehdev said: 'Her influence is not what it’s being made to be and, in the eyes of the modern woman in both the U.S. and the U.K., she’s not heralded in that way. 'Does she even deserve the title of style icon? The answer is no, because she doesn’t measure on the criteria of the style icon.' So why has the new mother fallen out of favour? While 68 per cent of those surveyed believe her style has a certain timelessness, Michelle Obama is seen to be fives time as daring in her dressing. Sehdev also believes that Kate's move from high street offerings such as Reiss and L.K. Bennett to designer garments such as Alexander McQueen means her style resonate less with the masses. 'Style icons today have to be enormously sexy and they have to have a great sense of style and fashion and flair and individuality and they also have to be dressing for themselves and not others,' Sehdev added.

"Inside a circle of dancers wearing native costumes, Miroslav Klose stood out as he celebrated his birthday in unusual style on Monday. It wasn't a traditional 'Happy Birthday' rendering for the Germany striker, but neither was the setting: a training pitch on an isolated patch of land on Brazil's Atlantic coast. Klose had just finished a fast-paced training session in hot and humid conditions but he was a willing participant in the little show. Top guns: Podolski (centre) and Ozil (right) pose with one of the indigenous dancers after a training session . Birthday boy: Klose gets into the party atmosphere as he celebrated turning 36 on Monday . Loew down: The Germany coach Joachim Loew looks a little confused by the post-training celebrations . The striker turned 36 on Monday and even being in Brazil was a little surprise. Klose had said after South Africa in 2010 that he'd probably played his last World Cup. Four years later, Klose is not only in Germany's squad, he is coach Joachim Loew's only real traditional striker, a dying breed in the Bundesliga. Germany has produced a wealth of top-level talent in recent years, but most of them are midfielders. Foreign strikers dominate the Bundesliga and Klose himself plays in Italy, for Lazio. Klose could break the World Cup scoring record in his fourth tournament - if he gets to play. Loew has been favoring a 'false nine' system, with attacking midfielders taking on the role of scorers. Thomas Mueller is a prime example, Mario Goetze is another. But Germany have lost Marco Reus, perhaps the most dangerous of their attacking midfielders, who injured his ankle in the final warm-up match, a 6-1 romp over Armenia. Dancing defence: Philipp Lahm and Arsenal's Per Mertesacker get into the mood in Santo Andre . Time out: Arsenal forwards Ozil and Podolski looked relaxed ahead of Germany's first game next Monday . Goetze scored two goals in that match but Klose also found the net and set a record. His 69th goal for Germany - in 132 matches - finally surpassed Gerd Mueller's mark of 68. Klose needs one goal to equal the record of 15 World Cup goals held by Brazil's Ronaldo, and again leave Mueller behind. Germany's general manager Oliver Bierhoff, himself a former striker, bemoans the lack of traditional center forward such as Klose. 'Unfortunately, we don't have `real nines' apart from foreigners in the Bundesliga,' Bierhoff said Monday. Assistant coach Hansi Flick said he expects Klose to get playing time in Brazil. 'I think he will play a significant role,' Flick said. 'Our rivals play differently against us now, they crowd the defense and we also have to be more versatile and to use different options in attack. But I am sure Miro will be an important player for us.' Young fan: Podolski presents a Brazilian youngster with a World Cup ball after playing with the locals . Enthralled: Bastian Schweinsteiger looked delighted by the festivities at the Germany training camp . Striking rivals: Klose (left) is looking to pass Ronaldo's World Cup goal-scoring record of 15 . Klose has always been Loew's preferred striker. The Poland-born Klose can control and distribute the ball well, a skill valued by Loew for his team's quick-passing game. But Klose has had an injury-filled season behind him, and played only 22 games for Lazio, scoring seven goals. His fitness has been in doubt, but Klose is well known for peaking at the right time. 'The preparations have been good, the World Cup can start,' he said before the team's departure for Brazil. Klose used to have target practice by turning off the light switch at his home by kicking a ball at it. Two more goals and he will be the top striker in World Cup history.","Arsenal stars join Germany striker with dancers wearing native costume .

"Andrew Flintoff has been left out of Lancashire's squad for the NatWest Twenty20 Blast Roses match against Yorkshire on Friday. The news capped a disappointing day for Flintoff, who scored just 16 and took two wickets but leaked 39 runs in the second XI T20 defeat by Leicestershire at Arundel. It was the first time in five years that the 36-year-old had featured for the county after last week signing a deal to play Twenty20 cricket.

At a stretch: The 36-year-old got through his four overs easily enough as he continues his comeback . He . may not be as quick as back then, but there was still a reminder of the .

Howard, affectionately known as Timmy by those who know him, was a teenage sensation on the court. His basketball coach Eddie Breheney recently told CBS: ‘Timmy’s athletic ability as a high school student was really off the charts. His agility, his hand-eye coordination, his stamina and just his love and passion for the game.’ By the age of 15, though, Howard was in goal for the USA youth teams and emerged as the nation’s most exciting young player, wining the MLS goalkeeper of the year award in 2001 and then earning a move to Manchester United in 2003.

The first Kansas-born player to appear at a World Cup, Besler was one of the standout performers in the 2-2 draw with Portugal on Sunday evening at the heart of the defence. Besler’s first cousin Maureen Hillis admitted to a local newspaper that the family were still getting to grips with Matt’s World Cup fame: ‘It’s been a lot of fun to be a part of this. To be honest, none of us really know soccer. We were all American football. 'Topeka has some soccer, but let’s face it, it’s not a big soccer town.

"Aston Villa are in talks to sign free agent Joe Cole. The 32-year-old had a medical at Villa on Monday evening and hopes to agree terms on a two-year deal and complete the move on Tuesday. Manager Paul Lambert wants to add experience to his young squad and believes Cole's ability to retain possession could aid his side. Free agent: Joe Cole was not given a new contract by West Ham and will now join Aston Villa . Interested: Paul Lambert thinks that the former England playmaker still has something to offer in the top flight . Cole, 32, was released by West Ham last month and has offers abroad, particularly in the MLS.

"Should Ross Barkley start for England at the World Cup? Wayne Rooney dominates the headlines. After a rusty display against Peru, followed by Roy Hodgson’s decision to use him out wide against Ecuador, a debate has started: will he — or won’t he — start alongside Daniel Sturridge when Italy stand in front of England in Manaus? Even if Rooney was on top form, I wouldn’t play him in the second striker’s position. It’s a supporting role to Sturridge but, more importantly, it includes the job of nullifying Andrea Pirlo. Rooney was given that task in the Euro 2012 quarter-final, alongside Andy Carroll, and could not lay a glove on the veteran playmaker. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Fabregas denied superb lob by last-gasp Pique clearance . Side by side: But what roles will Wayne Rooney (left) and Daniel Sturridge fill for England? People talk about Rooney’s best role being off the front, but I’ve never gone along with that theory. Of course, he can do it. He’s done it to great effect for club and country over the years, but when I think of the best I’ve seen Rooney, it was the 2009-10 season. Then, he scored 34 goals and won the PFA Player of the Year award as an out-and-out striker. Don’t forget, Sir Alex Ferguson used Danny Welbeck as a second striker, rather than Rooney, to stop Xabi Alonso against Real Madrid in the Champions League the season before last. Alonso is Madrid’s Pirlo. It’s not a . matter of a lack of workrate from Wayne. In fact, I think he actually . works too hard at times. And I’m not jumping on the ‘drop Rooney’ bandwagon either, but for tactical reasons I’d rather see a midfielder . being asked to pester Pirlo. Trophy boy: Rooney scooped the PFA Players Player of the Year Award in 2010 after scoring 34 goals . Having Adam Lallana, say, or Ross Barkley in there, with a midfielder’s mentality, would be more solid than having a striker dropping off from deeper. They would normally have Pirlo in front of them so they can see him — Rooney would be checking over his  shoulder — and both have the  ability to run past the Italian. Don’t forget, also, that the gifted young Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti will also be looking to cause problems for  England. Neither he nor Pirlo can be given space to create. A striker will, at times, be 20 to 30 yards away from Pirlo with a lot of ground to make up — and has Wayne got enough fitness to do that job in these conditions? Chasing shadows: Rooney couldn't get near Italy's Andrea Pirlo in Euro 2012 . It may seem harsh when Rooney is the fifth highest goalscorer in England’s history after he scored against Ecuador in Miami, along with six goals in eight games in the qualifying programme, but Sturridge is currently the best option to play at centre forward. That means Wayne has to play wide. This, though, does not mean he is filling a limited, defensive role. Quite the opposite, in fact. He would be asked to attack from the left, like Luis Suarez does for  Uruguay. There is a big difference with that job compared to a left midfielder. Talk has been about Sturridge and Rooney creating a partnership similar to the Liverpool pairing of Sturridge and Suarez. I’ve watched them a lot this season and they have been lethal with their goals in the Barclays Premier League, but I wouldn’t say there was great  chemistry between them. Making history: Rooney's goal against Ecuador moved him up to fifth in the all-time England scoring charts . In the mix: Ross Barkley (left) should be deployed to thwart the inspirational Pirlo . They are two top strikers, but it is too simplistic to say they played as a pair all season. When Liverpool used a back three and a diamond formation, both systems give you the numbers in the centre of the park and allow you to play a front two. The diamond would be my choice against Italy, with Rooney and Sturridge supported by Barkley or Lallana to choke the space around Pirlo. I doubt Raheem Sterling will be included, given that he has played so little in the warm-up games. But it looks like Roy will deploy two sitting midfielders with three supporting a single striker (Sturridge) in a 4-2-3-1 system. Another question for the management would be: do they believe Rooney and Sturridge can complete those three group games in nine days and in these conditions? I don’t believe they can. Centre stage: Liverpool star Sturridge is set to spearhead England's attack in Brazil . Having worked with Daniel, he is prone to a niggle between games and that could mean missing vital tactical sessions or missing the next game. Rooney has been criticised for his performances in tournaments since Portugal 2004. I don’t think his ability is in question, more his adaptability to play in those  conditions at the end of a season. There have been plenty of times when I’ve seen him looking shattered as we’ve struggled to keep the ball, and he’s chasing shadows. With three games in quick succession, what would Sir Alex Ferguson, Jose Mourinho or Arsene Wenger do at club level towards the end of a season? They would rotate. We never do it, as there’s a fear that if it goes wrong, the manager will be hung out to dry. But the manager needs to make bold decisions. Plenty to ponder: Roy Hodgson must decide where best to use Rooney . Rooney and Sturridge with Welbeck as a front three gives versatility and unpredictability. They can all play from the flanks or through the middle, so there can be lots of interchanging, which would mean Italy could never relax. Rooney and Sturridge are two of the best players in the squad and I have no doubt they could be dangerous as a pair, but in the biggest games against top opposition I don’t think there’s room for both through the middle. Roy has a reputation for playing it safe but I feel this tournament is about being brave with selection and changes from the bench.","Liverpool star Sturridge should spearhead England's attack .

"Harry Redknapp is refusing to lift the lid on the England 'refuseniks' after Three Lions captain Steven Gerrard ordered the QPR boss to name and shame the players who he claimed have feigned injury to avoid international duty. Redknapp had told Radio 5 Live at the weekend that when he was Tottenham boss some players had asked him to pull them out of England squads. The claim, however, riled Gerrard after he admitted he was 'broken' by England's failure to get out of the group stages. VIDEO Scroll down for Steven Gerrard: The World Cup has left me a broken man . Staying quiet: QPR boss Harry Redknapp won't name the players who used to avoid playing for England . Not impressed: England captain Steven Gerrard wants Redknapp to name the players involved . ‘I tell you what, I’d be interested to find out who those players are,' said Gerrard. ‘If Harry is making a comment like that, he should name them and embarrass them. No one in this group wants to go home. No one wants to go home. ‘If he’s not naming them, I can’t answer that. If it’s the case, it’s disgusting. For me, if a player doesn’t want to be, he doesn’t deserve to be here at a World Cup. The comment is a comment, like ‘them’. ‘They’ didn’t want to play for England. Who? Name them? Is it Aaron Lennon, Kyle Walker, Andros Townsend? ‘I don’t know who he means. Five years ago? 10 years ago? I’ve spoken to Jermain Defoe and he’s devastated. ‘I can understand why you’ve asked the question, with Harry Redknapp a big coach in the game, but we need names. We need names. But it’s not here. I can guarantee it’s not here. ‘He should be embarrassed if there’s one player. When you go down into the younger age groups, they’re younger lads. ‘They might not want to be away from their families. But when you’re picked at this level and find any excuse not to be here, you don’t deserve to be here.’ Upset: Gerrard says former Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe is 'devastated' by Redknapp's claims . Tough night: Gerrard and Phil Jagielka look on dejected during England's World Cup defeat to Uruguay . Doubts: Redknapp has questioned the commitment of young English players to the national team cause . But Redknapp responded to Sportsmail, saying: ‘I understand Steven’s concern but I don’t want to get into naming names because it wouldn’t be fair to the players. Every Premier League manager past and present knows what I’m talking about. 'Probably even Roy Hodgson. But sadly this attitude is not unusual these days. You’ve only got to look at how many players pull out of an international game on Tuesday and Wednesday then are running about for their clubs the next Saturday to see that this is a very real issue.’ Hodgson also claimed it would be a major surprise if there were players involved with his squads who found excuses not to join up with the national team. Thumbs up: Hodgson believes there has been a greater interest in playing for England during his time in charge . England’s head coach added: 'We have to make clear to players: if you want to play for England, you commit yourself for England. ‘In the two years I’ve been here, I’ve seen a greater interest in playing for England, so Harry’s comments come as a bit of a surprise. ‘If you make comments like that, you have to name them. I could name a player with an educated guess but players? It’s unfair to ask people to look back historically. Let’s see how it will be moving forward. Let’s keep our standards high.’ Redknapp's nephew Frank Lampard, meanwhile, will captain England in the final game of the 2014 World Cup as Gerrard drops to the bench against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday.","Redknapp says he has dealt with players who asked to be pulled out of England squads .

"A footballer and two Far Eastern businessmen were jailed today for plotting to fix the results of lower league matches. Michael Boateng, 22, of Davidson Road, Croydon, south London, was found guilty alongside businessmen Chann Sankaran and Krishna Ganeshan, of conspiracy to commit bribery after a four-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court. Sankaran, 33, and Ganeshan, 44, described in court as the 'central figures' in efforts to influence the outcome of matches in League Two and the Conference South, were jailed for five years each. Imprisoned: Chann Sankaran, Krishna Ganeshan and Michael Boateng have been jailed . Subtle: The trio have been jailed for conspiracy to commit bribery . Boateng, a former defender with Conference South club Whitehawk FC, was sentenced to 16 months for his role in the plot. Sentencing the men, Judge Melbourne Inman QC, said: 'Professional football and sport play an important part in national life and individuals’ lives in this country. 'Those who make determined attempts to destroy its integrity for personal gain must expect significant prison sentences so when such acts are discovered a clear signal is sent to others.' The judge . told Sankaran he would be 'liable to deportation' to his home country . once he had served his sentence, but it would be a matter for the Home . Secretary to consider. He . told the co-conspirators the detail of their scheme had been laid bare . by covertly recorded conversations following an investigation initially . by the Daily Telegraph and latterly by the National Crime Agency, back . in November 2013. Playing days: Boateng during his time at Bristol Rovers in 2011 . To Ganeshan and Sankaran he said: 'I am satisfied you were at the head of this conspiracy, you two were the controlling minds. 'The . two of you came to this country in November last year, for the sole . reason of visiting clubs to find players you could corrupt to fix . matches.' He said they had clearly targeted lower division football clubs because the cost of bribing the players 'on their modest wages' was cheaper than approaching players from the higher leagues.Ganeshan and Sankaran had set upon 'a plan to corrupt professional footballers', according to Judge Inman. 'This was an, if not sophisticated, then well-planned and determined conspiracy motivated by the expectation of significant gain.' Caught: Ganeshan attempted to change large amount of euros into sterling at various money bureaux . Red handed: Sankaran and Ganeshan attemptng to change large amount euros nto sterling at various places . The judge said it was 'sad to see' Boateng in the dock alongside the two businessmen and who, it was heard, had been a valued church and charity group youth worker in London prior to his crime. Judge Inman told the former footballer: 'You allowed yourself to quickly be drawn in to this scheme' and said he had shown he was 'perfectly willing to corrupt other footballers' as part of the conspiracy. Among the players Boateng attempted to recruit was one of his oldest friends, Hakeem Adelakun, who was acquitted of any involvement in the conspiracy. Adelakun, 23, of Thornton Heath, south London, told the jury he had known nothing of the bribery scheme. Judge Inman told Boateng his behaviour towards Adelakun showed he had been 'perfectly willing to bring an innocent young man into this scheme if you could.' 'It is, sadly, pure greed that allowed you to become involved in what Sankaran and Ganeshan were doing,' he added.","Footballer Michael Boateng found guilty of conspiracy to commit bribery .

His Uruguay teammates have already been lifted by the news and senior players have been talking about a new buzz in the camp ahead of Thursday's game. Suarez warned though: 'There is not one player that is going to be the saviour. We all have to work together to carry on.' Waiting game: The Uruguay striker was forced to sit out of their opening 3-1 defeat to Costa Rica . He also thanked Liverpool for not interfering and allowing Uruguay to take care of his recovery. He added: 'There was never a moment when Liverpool said to me ''don't play''. The club have complete trust in Uruguay's team. 'I know all the English national-team players, both because they are team-mates or because they are rivals.

"Former England skipper Terry Butcher has been sacked by Hibs after less than seven months in charge of the Edinburgh outfit. The Easter Road club were relegated to the Championship – the second tier of Scottish football – after an atrocious run of results culminated in them losing a relegation-promotion play-off with Hamilton. Hibs chairman Rod Petrie and chief executive Leeann Dempster met with Butcher on Monday, with the board then unanimously agreeing to dispense with his services today. Gone: Former England skipper Terry Butcher has been sacked following Hibs' relegation to the Championship . Dempster said: 'I have to say that we all regret that this decision had to be made, but during conversation it became clear that a different approach was needed. 'Sadly, for a variety of reasons and perhaps including unfortunate timing, it hasn't worked out for Terry here. That is disappointing for all concerned. I am genuinely saddened that we have had to take this tough decision. 'It may have taken longer than we all would have liked but I felt it was appropriate that we met properly and had a full discussion before any decision was made. 'Now we need to move forward and act to bring in a new manager with the aim of getting us promoted back to where Hibernian belongs, in the top league of Scottish football, from a uniquely competitive Championship. Moving on: Hibs will now bid to find a successor to Butcher who was sacked after just seven months in charge . 'Our first aim must be to try to win the league and gain promotion automatically. 'The search now begins to find and appoint the next manager, and while we will try to keep supporters updated regarding the process as much as we can, I know they will understand that we need to be professional in all that we do. 'Unfortunately, assistant manager Maurice Malpas is abroad on holiday at present and I want to meet him on his return to explain the situation at the club.'

"A host of ridiculous Victorian inventions so strange they were never made it into production have been revealed for the first time. The quirky designs, which include a corset with inflatable bust, a portable bath and a ventilating hat, have been held at the National Archives in Kew, Richmond, for 150 years. Known as the ‘age of invention’, the era welcomed breakthroughs  from the likes of Robert Stevenson, who was famed for his construction of lighthouses, and engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel - who designed the first propeller-driven transatlantic steamship. Scroll down for video . A design for a corset with an expandable bust, invented by F.Parsons in 1881. It works by inflating the cups with a tube to make the breasts appear larger . The Bonafide Ventilating Hat, invented by John Fuller & Co. in 1849, was designed to stop gentlemen's heads overheating while wearing top hats, a big problem at the time . And everyday people began coming up with their own creations in the hope that they would hit on a big idea that could change their lives. The inventing craze was kick-started when laws allowing ideas to be copyrighted quickly and cheaply were introduced in 1843. Each design, such as the Anti-Garrotting Cravat and a portable hair brushing machine, was logged in enormous books which were then archived. It also includes designs for a moustache protector, a pair of glasses with two sets of lenses and a gadget that doubles up as a knife and fork, as well as a device to get shoes on and off. The inventions have been collecting dust at the National Archives until record specialist for registered designs, Julie Halls, sifted through them. She has now complied them into a book called ‘Inventions that Didn’t Change the World’. Described as a useful new design the portable bath, which is set upon wheels, was designed by Thomas Simmons and Ann Street in Birmingham in 1861 . The Desideratum Combined Knife and Fork, invented by, Messrs Arnold and Son in 1881 was designed with the intentions that people would be able to eat with one hand . Mrs Halls said: ‘These designs were registered in the mid-1800s following the introduction of the Utility Designs Act which protected “useful” inventions under copyright. ‘It was much cheaper and quicker for smaller inventors to register their designs this way rather than go down the long, expensive patenting route. ‘There was a rush of inventors wanting to copyright their ideas.’ She explained that the designers had to take their inventions to the New Designs Registry at Somerset House in London where they would be given a registered design number. ‘Designers had to provide two identical drawings of their designs, one of which was stuck into a huge leather-bound volumes and the other would be returned to the copyright holder,’ she added. ‘Gradually these volumes of designs built up and because they belonged to the Government they eventually ended up at the National Archives for safekeeping. A design for a 'jack' for putting on and pulling off boots, invented by, Edward Fox, in 1846. It features in the new book complied from the National Archives . A design for an Anti - Garotting Cravat, invented by Walter Thornhill in 1862 - the same year an MP was the victim of a robbery by garrotting . A moustache protector, designed by Alfred Arculus in 1867, is among several designs that never made it into production from the Victorian era of inventions . ‘These enormous tomes are full of the most amazing inventions, a lot of which never saw the light of day. ‘At that time there was such a culture of entrepreneurship and a real interest in how things worked, partly thanks to the success of inventors like Stevenson and Brunel. ‘It’s surprising how many designs were submitted by people inventing things to do with their own line of business. ‘Surgeons would register designs for surgical instruments and cooks would register designs for kitchen products. ‘The designs seem humorous or inexplicably strange now but a lot of them made sense in the context of the period of time. A Portable Rotary Hair Brushing Machine, invented by James Beckett, in 1864. Everyday people of the time hoped their designs would take off and change their lives . This figure shows the design for a 'breast reliever', which was invented by Alexander Robertson, in 1849. It never made it into production and collected dust elsewhere . ‘A lot of the problems these inventions set out to solve have been lost in the mist of time but back then they were real issues. ‘For example, the anti-garrotting cravat was designed in response to a real scare at that time when convicts who would have normally been sent to the colonies were being pardoned. ‘It was registered in 1862, the same year an MP was the victim of a robbery by garrotting. ‘The Bonafide Ventilating Hat was designed to stop gentlemen's heads overheating while wearing top hats, a big problem at the time. ‘My favourite is the corset with an expansible bust. Obviously body image was as big an issue for Victorian women as it is for us nowadays and this design allowed for the bust to be inflated using a tube. ‘The Victorian period was known as the age of invention and most people only know about the big inventions like trains, the telegraph and the telephone. ‘But there was a whole sub-culture of inventing going on which we never get to hear about. ‘These designs are little known about and have never been published before. We wanted to show people what a productive time it was.’ Designs reflected things that were possibly needed at the time like this one for an 'Invalid's Exercising Chair', invented by Robert Kerry, in 1852 .

"Argentina will need to improve in their next World Cup games despite having 'genius' Lionel Messi, coach Alejandro Sabella has admitted. Messi's scored a last-gasp winner to give Argentina a 1-0 win over Iran on Saturday and guarantee them progress to the knockout stages from Group F. That was the four-time Ballon d'Or winner's second goal of the tournament, after he also scored the winner against Bosnia in Argentina's opener. 'Genius': Messi was Argentina's matchwinner again, but Sabella is looking for improvement . Challenge: Sabella wants more from his players after they only just managed to beat Iran 1-0 . Messi's ability to drag Argentina to victory despite average performances in their first two games has drawn comparisons to Diego Maradona in 1986. And Sabella praised his matchwinner from both games - but said Argentina's other players must improve if they are to have any chance of realising their dreams of lifting the World Cup in the Maracana. 'We want to improve obviously,' Sabella said. 'There are many things we have to think about and improve. 'All players who played today have contributed to this victory but of course we have a genius who is called Messi. Fortunately he is Argentine. Everybody would have liked to have Messi but it is us who have him.' World class: Messi brilliantly curls home the winner with his left foot to save Argentina's blushes . Wonder strike: Sabella said two goalkeepers couldn't stop Messi, so no wonder Alireza Haghighi struggled . After a frustrating 90 minutes against the gutsy Iranians, Messi broke the deadlock with a delightful curling shot in stoppage time to the delight of tens of thousands of Argentine fans at the Estadio Mineirao. 'It was a very difficult match and Iran played a great World Cup match. But that last play from Lionel, no one could have stopped it. Not even two goalkeepers could have stopped that Lionel shot,' Sabella said. Argentina, among the title favourites in Brazil, played below par for the second consecutive game after narrowly winning their opener against Bosnia 2-1. They may have secured qualification to the round of 16 but Sabella, who had fielded an attacking formation with Gonzalo Higuain, Messi, Sergio Aguero and Angel Di Maria, said they would analyse what had not worked that well, including breaking past the Iranians down the wings. Leaving the rest behind: Messi celebrates his goal, but Argentina were underwhelming in Belo Horizonte . 'This sort of thing can happen, it shouldn't but it does,' said the Argentine, who won the Copa Libertadores in the Belo Horizonte stadium with Estudiantes in 2009. 'Of course we always want to win, obviously, so we will try to strike a balance in the next games but it is not always easy,' he said. 'Sometimes during counter-attacks we decide a match but today things got a little difficult with our counter-attacks, I want to congratulate Iran because they played a brilliant game.' Team game: Messi and his team mates look relieved as they secured qualification from the group late on .","Not even two goalkeepers could stop Messi, Sabella says .

"Della Callagher, 46, died two days after eating a reheated festive lunch on Christmas Day 2012 . A chef who worked at a pub where a customer died from Christmas Day dinner poisoning admits he did not test whether the turkey was cooked properly. Mother-of-one Della Callagher, 46, died two days after eating a reheated four-course festive lunch at the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch, Essex on Christmas Day 2012. None of the meals, which left 32 other people seriously ill, were probed with a thermometer at the point of serving to ensure they were safe to eat. The pub’s former landlady, Anne-Marie McSweeney, 40, and head chef Mehmet Kaya, 37, along with the brewer Mitchells & Butler, are accused of serving unsafe food. McSweeney’s lawyers insist she could have had no idea what temperature the turkey was and blame kitchen staff for the lethal mistake. Andre Paxi, a junior chef, admitted that the turkey meat, which had been cooked the day before, was not tested before it was served. Mr Paxi, who had worked at the Railway Hotel for four years, said about half the turkey meat had been heated in a food warmer, while the rest was blasted in the microwave if it seemed too cool. Yannick Fielding, defending McSweeney said: ‘In an ideal world, all of the turkey should have been put in the microwave before being served to customers, is that right? ‘Yes’ Mr Paxi replied. Mr Paxi added: ‘If they are not sure the food is hot enough [kitchen staff] have to use a probe, but if they are sure they don’t have to use a probe.’ Asked how he would make the decision if the food was hot enough without the probe, Mr Paxi replied: ‘We would look at the steam.’ He agreed that anyone who had not actually been in the kitchen would have had no idea whether the lethal turkey would have been in the microwave. More than 30 diners fell ill with food poisoning after the meal at the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch, Essex . The meat-based gravy had not had its temperature probed and recorded either. Mr Paxi was sacked by senior managers at Mitchells & Butler but he said he had been made a scapegoat. Kaya and McSweeney are accused of contaminating the meat on Christmas Eve by failing to follow proper cooking and cooling procedure. The pub's former landlady, Anne-Marie McSweeney, is accused of serving unsafe food to diners . Kaya, who had spent eight years with the chain, told investigators that he had cooked the turkey meat on the 24 December, and begun the cooling process between 3 and 4pm. He gave a detailed account of how he had checked the temperature of each breast, and recorded the results in the kitchen’s records. Kaya then said he had placed the containers over a chiller for one hour before checking and recording the temperature again, before placing them in a walk-in fridge at about 8pm. But CCTV footage showed him leaving the pub at 4pm and he did not return for the rest of the day. McSweeney, who had worked for the company for 24 years, then claimed she had checked the temperature of the cooling meat herself, and had remembered the figures so that he could write them in the log on his next shift. The pub’s CCTV footage showed she had not left the front of house for more than two minutes for the remainder of the shift, allegedly not giving her enough time to check the turkey in the kitchen. In an earlier hearing, Mrs Callagher’s husband John told the court his wife’s death was ‘horrific’ and described the moment she began shaking and rolled her eyes back while lying in bed next to him. He told the court that his wife began to feel unwell at around 5:30am on Boxing Day and he started to feel unwell about an hour later. Mr Callagher said: 'We both had the same symptoms, but Della got progressively far worse than me as we went throughout the day, with vomiting, diarrhoea and stomach pain. 'I was getting increasingly concerned as the day went on. The vomiting and diarrhoea wouldn't stop and Della was a very private person, and it was horrific to see what was going on. 'My mother-in-law called NHS Helpline first and that didn't seem to work, whatever that was, and then the paramedics were called by 999.’ He added that because of the food poisoning, which was later attributed to a bacteria known as Clostridium perfringens, he was too unwell to go to hospital with her. She later returned home after doctors believed she had norovirus and paramedics gave her an injection in the ambulance. Mother-of-one, Mrs Callagher, who tragically later died, was initially seen at Queen's Hospital in Romford . Mr Callagher said: 'She got far, far, far, worse. It was horrific.' He added: 'Something changed. I felt her physically shake and her eyes rolled, as if she was having a cardiac arrest.' He claimed that the ambulance took more than 45 minutes to arrive, as somebody instructed his brother how to do CPR. He said: 'We had someone on the line who was instructing us to do CPR. My brother-in-law was giving her CPR and trying to save her, but there was no sign of life.’ Mrs Callagher was pronounced dead at the hospital on December 27, 2012 at around 8:15am. The pub company, based on Fleet Street, Birmingham, denies two counts of placing unsafe food on the market by failing to enforce food hygiene standards in its outlets. McSweeney, of Suttons Avenue, Hornchurch, and Kaya of Purfleet, Essex, both deny a charge of placing unsafe food on the market, and a further charge of doing an act to pervert the course of justice by allegedly falsifying their food safety records. McSweeney further denies obstructing an officer in the course of their duty for allegedly handing the falsified documents to food safety inspectors. The trial continues. The bacterium Clostridium perfringens is widely distributed in the environment and food. It is the third most common cause of food poisoning in the UK. If spores of the bacteria survive cooking, they can germinate to form growing cells. Spores cannot grow in a refrigerator or freezer but thrive at room temperature. In optimal growing conditions, the organism has a generation time of 10 to 12 minutes. When a large number of the vegetative cells are consumed this will more-likely-than-not lead to gastroenteritis. Food poisoning from the bacteria most often occurs when foodstuffs, usually red meat or poultry, is prepared in advance and kept warm for several hours before serving. The illness, with diarrhoea and abdominal pain the main symptoms, generally lasts for less than 24 hours but elderly people may be more seriously affected. The bacteria is also responsible for 80-95 per cent of gas gangrene cases, a rare but severe form of gangrene.

"Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has projected that Argentina will be the most likely opponent if the hosts can make it all the way to the World Cup final. Scolari says he and his staff analysed the tournament's bracket and predicted the two South American powers will meet in the July 13 final. While Argentina is one of the chief threats to Brazil winning the tournament, Scolari wants them to do well, as a final between them would match 'great players' and two teams with 'a lot of quality' against each other.

'I hope we can make it a Brazil-Argentina final, a South American final, with players that have great technical ability. 'I don't want Argentina to drop out beforehand. I want them to play their best football. If they lose, it's not my problem. 'My problem is Brazil. I have to take Brazil to the final, taking on whoever stands in our way.'

"David Villa struck twice to extend his record goal tally for Spain to 58 as the champions eased to a 2-0 win over El Salvador on Saturday in their final warm-up game before the World Cup in Brazil. Spain dominated the Central American minnows at the FedEx Stadium and barely broke into a sweat in securing a comfortable victory ahead of their opening Group B match against Netherlands in the city of Salvador on Friday. Vicente Del Bosque's team squandered a chance to take an early lead when Diego Costa was felled in the penalty area by goalkeeper Henry Hernandez and Cesc Fabregas smashed his fourth-minute spot kick over the crossbar. Cheeky: David Villa celebrates after scoring the opening goal for Spain against El Salvador . No hard feelings: Diego Costa (right) was quick to congratulate his strike partner . Target: Costa (right) brings the ball down on his chest during Spain's friendly win . Villa, whose goals helped propel Spain to their maiden world title in South Africa four years ago, came off the bench at the break and was in the right place to nod in a Sergio Ramos knockdown in the 60th minute. Another substitute, Sergio Busquets, crashed a long-range effort against the crossbar in the 80th minute before goalkeeper David De Gea made his debut for La Roja when he replaced captain Iker Casillas for the final 10 minutes. David Silva floated the ball into the area three minutes from time and Villa chested it down and fired into the corner on his 96th appearance.

"Roy Hodgson refused to join in the widespread praise of Ross Barkley despite the young Everton midfielder's sparkling performance in Miami. Speaking to reporters after the 2-2 draw with Ecuador, Hodgson also said he would not address the 'obsession' to start the 20-year-old against Italy in Manaus. Hodgson said: 'I thought Wayne Rooney played very, very well and I think Ross Barkley had some good moments. I think he needs to learn when he can . turn with the ball and when he has to keep the ball. Dazzling: Ross Barkley was brilliant in the 2-2 draw against Ecuador, but Roy Hodgson wants him to improve . 'Obsession': Roy Hodgson would not be drawn on the question of Barkley's involvement in Manuas . 'But that's quite . normal for a player his age. He'll be quite happy to have played so long . on his first start.' Asked whether Barkley would be among the starters against Italy, Hodgson then added: 'There always seems to be an enormous obsession with one player. 'I will be prepared to start any of the players in any game, but I'm not prepared to address your obsession with Ross Barkley. 'If he's going to be the player we want him to be, he has to make better decisions of when he turns with the ball. Effortless: Barkley, 20, was in complete control and comfortable in his first England start . In front: Lambert lashed a powerful shot into the corner after a driving run by the Everton youngster . 'That's not a criticism, but there were . other performances out there today. Oxlade-Chamberlain and Phil Jones . were outstanding, as was Jack Wilshere in the middle of the park, while . Rickie Lambert scored a magnificent goal.' In an entertaining game, England found themselves a goal down, then a goal in front before being pegged back by a Michael Arroyo thunderbolt that flew into the top corner. Raheem Sterling and Antonio Valencia were both sent off after the Manchester United winger overreacted to a hard challenge from the young Liverpool flyer - Sterling got the ball but will now miss the final World Cup warm-up against Honduras on Saturday. You're off: Raheem Sterling will miss the friendly against Honduras after he was sent off . Worry: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was forced into an early exit after picking up a knee injury . 'I thought it was a very good game,' Hodgson added. 'I was disappointed with the sendings off, and the potential injury to one of our players (Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who suffered possible ligament damage) - but as a friendly, a warm-up match for our players, it was good. 'They tested us but we dealt with them very well for long periods, and caused their defence many problems. We could have been several goals up before they scored their goal. 'If the players cope with things as well as these players on Saturday, we'll go to Brazil and Manaus very confident.'","Roy Hodgson was impressed with Barkley but says he has things to learn .
