The former general, who arrived home in Pakistan earlier this week after four years exile, is seen lifting weights and doing aerobics with the caption 'Starting my day with a workout. Feel very energized'. In another shot, one of Musharraf's security men is pictured standing guard outside a building alongside a caption reading: 'Taliban threat? NOT ON MY WATCH!!!'

Tough customer: Musharraf's security man is pictured standing guard at . night with the caption 'Taliban Threat? NOT ON MY WATCH!!' The 69-year-old is hated by militants . for backing America after the attacks of 11 September, 2001 and his . return to Pakistan was immediately met with death threats from the Taliban. He ruled Pakistan from 2001 to 2008 after seizing power in 1999 coup and is now intending to lead his party, the . All Pakistan Muslim League, in the May elections.

Yesterday an angry lawyer threw a shoe at Musharraf as he headed to court in southern Pakistan on Friday to face legal charges. Musharraf, who seized power in a military coup in 1999 but was forced to step down nearly a decade later, is disliked by many lawyers throughout Pakistan because of his decision to suspend the chief justice of the Supreme Court while he was in office. The lawyer tossed his shoe at Musharraf as the former military strongman was walking down a hallway in the court building in the city of Karachi surrounded by a mob of security, supporters and journalists, said police official Nasir Aftab. The shoe did not hit Musharraf, and the lawyer was not detained because no charges were filed against him, said Aftab.

The politician tweeted this picture on the flight into Pakistan after four years in exile in the UK . Another of the personal pictures the former Pakistani president posted on his Twitter and Facebook pages . Throwing a shoe at someone is an especially potent insult in Muslim countries because the sole is considered unclean. Local TV channels showed video of the incident, but it was impossible to identify the shoe thrower because he was hidden behind part of the corridor. Following the incident, judges granted Musharraf an extension of pre-emptive bail in three cases against him, meaning he cannot be immediately arrested. Two of the cases involve the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the killing of Akbar Bugti, a Baluch nationalist leader who died in August 2006 after a standoff with the Pakistani military. Musharraf was granted an extension of 21 days in those two cases. He was granted a 15-day extension in connection with a third case, in which he is accused of illegally removing a number of judges at the time, including the Supreme Court chief justice, said Shahadat Awan, the prosecutor general for surrounding Sindh province. Musharraf was also restricted from leaving the country during the period that his bail was extended, Pakistani state TV reported.

Michael Jackson's personal physician branded the star's family 'bottom dwellers' and said he was a made a scapegoat for his death in a bizarre prison cell interview in which he burst into song. Dr Conrad Murray's unexpected rendition . of Nat King Cole's The Little Boy That Santa Claus Forgot came as Michael Jackson’s mother and children begin a legal battle for a staggering £26.5billion in a case . that could shed new light on his death. The family claim the promoter AEG . Live, which was behind his planned UK comeback shows, was negligent in . its alleged hiring and supervision of Dr Conrad . Murray. Murray who is . serving a four-year prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter over . the 50-year-old star’s death, gave a lengthy interview to CNN in which he discussed the star's death, their friendship, his court case and his relationship with the singer's children. Scroll down for video . Trial: The family of Michael Jackson (left) are seeking £26.5 billion in compensation from his last concert promoter AEG Live for the alleged negligent hiring and supervision of Dr Conrad Murray (right) Compensation: Prince Jackson (left) Blanket Jackson (centre) and Paris Jackson (right), pictured in 2011, want the record payout from AEG Live for its alleged negligent hiring and supervision of Dr Conrad Murray . He did not give evidence at his own trial in . 2011, but he is on the witness list in the case . that was scheduled to begin with jury selection in Los Angeles . yesterday, raising the prospect that he may be called from prison to . testify. When asked if he would, he said: 'If I testify, I will testify very honestly,' he told CNN. 'It is a sad thing when I look at . what's going on in television because Michael would be absolutely upset, . he would be so unhappy with what is happening. Michael said to me 'I no . longer want to be a bank for my family .All we see is the continuation . of that.' As he began singing he said that he and Jackson both 'experienced pain.' Jackson’s daughter Paris, 14, is also . expected give evidence about his death, and his son Prince Michael, 16, . about a conversation he allegedly had with his father about the concert . promoter. Murray claimed he has 'a beautiful, blessed . relationship—an extremely good one' with Jackson's children. Hearing: Michael Jackson's mother Katherine Jackson leaves the sentencing hearing of Dr Conrad Murray . 'Prince Jr., Paris and Blanket are like my own kids,' he said. 'They are . my children. I love those children. I worry about them.' He made a barbed comment towards the rest of the late pop star's family saying 'I am pretty sure there are a number of bottom dwellers right now who . are sucking up for anything they can, but I do hope the children will . not fall victim of that.' In the rest of the interview with CNN, he continued to protest his innonence saying 'I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.' At times his lawyer Valerie Wass stopped Murray from saying more that might relate to his criminal case, which she is appealing. Lawyers acting for Paris, Prince . Michael, their brother Blanket, 10, and their grandmother Katherine, 82, . contend that pressure from AEG led to Jackson’s death from an overdose . of surgical anaesthetic in June 2009, two weeks before his This Is It . concerts were to begin at the O2 Arena in London. Manslaughter: Jackson's personal doctor Dr Conrad Murray is serving a four-year prison sentence after being found guilty of manslaughter in 2011 . Friends: Michael Jackson with his chimp, Bubbles . Ruling: Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos ruled in February that the Jackson family lawyers had shown enough evidence to warrant a trial . After a judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence to warrant a jury trial, the family’s lawyer Kevin Boyle said: ‘The truth about what happened to Michael, which AEG has tried to keep hidden from the public since the day Michael died, is finally emerging. ‘We look forward to the trial where the rest of the story will come to light.’ The family are demanding £6.6billion for loss of future earnings by Jackson, and nearly £20billion in other damages. AEG, which denies any liability for the star’s death, says the huge figure is based on speculation and that Jackson’s career was on a downward spiral. Legal analysts say the billions being claimed are unlikely to be awarded and are a legal tactic to get publicity for the case. A senior AEG lawyer said the company would argue at the civil trial, which is expected to last two to three months, that Jackson’s addiction to prescription drugs made him responsible for his own death. The company is also likely to bring up Jackson’s ‘shopping’ for doctors to prescribe him drugs, as well as his acquittal on child molestation charges. In a TV documentary to be broadcast on Friday, AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam says: ‘I don’t know how you can’t look to Mr Jackson’s responsibility. He was a grown man. ‘Mr Jackson is a person who was known to doctor-shop. He was known to be someone who would tell one doctor one thing and another doctor something else.’ He said Jackson’s 2005 child molestation trial was  relevant because it ‘resulted in an incredible increase in his drug intake’. ‘We’re talking about Michael Jackson,’ adds Mr Putnam. ‘This is a man who would show up in pyjamas. ‘This is a man who would go to public events with a monkey named Bubbles.’ At Murray’s trial it emerged that the doctor was paid £100,000 a month to help Jackson get enough rest to perform at the O2. But AEG will argue that Murray was hired by Jackson, not the promoter.","Family seeking payout for promoter's alleged hiring of Dr Conrad Murray .

Bishop of London Richard Chartres said: 'After the storm of a life led in the heat of political controversy, there is a great calm¿ at Baroness Thatcher's funeral . The Bishop of London paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher yesterday by saying that ‘after the storm of a life led in the heat of political controversy, there is a great calm’. He added: ‘Lying here, she is one of us, subject to the common destiny of all.’ The funeral address by the Right Reverend Richard Chartres was the centrepiece of a simple service; at Lady Thatcher’s own request there were no eulogies. His words delighted the former prime minister’s allies and prompted tears and laughter as he applauded her strength of character and Methodist faith. He also debunked controversy over  the most provocative quote of Baroness Thatcher’s career – that there is ‘no such thing as society’. In an address deemed perfectly pitched by her closest friends in politics, the bishop hailed her as a ‘mythological figure’ and went out of his way to draw a line under the comment that has been a millstone around Tory necks since she delivered it in 1987 – setting it in its proper context. He said the former premier had referred to the Christian doctrine, ‘that we are  all members one of another, expressed  in the concept of the Church on earth as the Body of Christ’. ‘From this we learn our interdependence and the great truth that we do not achieve happiness or salvation in isolation from each other but as members of society,’ he quoted her saying. ‘Her later remark about there being no such thing as “society” has been misunderstood, and refers to some impersonal entity to which we are tempted to surrender our independence,’ he explained. ‘She was very aware there are prior dispositions which are needed to make market economics and democratic institutions function well: the habits of  truth-telling, mutual sympathy, and  the capacity to co-operate. These dispositions are incubated and given power by our relationships. ‘In her words, “the basic ties of the family are at the heart of our society and are the very nursery of civic virtue”.’ The Bishop of London Richard Chartres paid tribute to Lady Thatcher's ¿courtesy and personal kindness' at her funeral on Wednesday . Bishop of London Richard Chartres (left) stood with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby (right), behind Thatcher's children Mark, right, and Carol, left . Conservative MP Ben Wallace, an aide to minister without portfolio Kenneth Clarke, said: ‘The Bishop of London chose to dispel one of the Left’s many smears that Mrs Thatcher didn’t believe in society. It is a long overdue correction.’ The bishop paid tribute to Lady Thatcher’s ‘courtesy and personal kindness which she showed to those who worked for her, as well as her capacity to reach out to the young, and often also to those who were not, in the world’s eyes, “important”.’ He added that it was important to debate Lady Thatcher’s policies and legacy and to assess the impact of political decisions on the everyday lives of individuals  and communities. But he insisted: ‘Parliament held a frank debate last week – but here and today is neither the time nor the place. This, at Lady Thatcher’s personal request, is a funeral service, not a memorial service with the customary eulogies. At Lady Thatcher's request the service did not include eulogies and instead featured an address from the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, left, pictured with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby . ‘At such a time, the parson should not aspire to the judgments which are proper to the politician; instead this is a place for ordinary human compassion of the kind that is reconciling. ‘It is also the place for the simple truths which transcend political debate. Above all it is the place for hope.’ He said she described her religious upbringing in a lecture she gave in the nearby church of St Lawrence Jewry: ‘Her upbringing, of course, was in Methodism to which this country owes a huge debt. When it was time to challenge the political and economic status quo in 19th century Britain, it was so often the Methodists who took the lead.’ The Bishop pointed out it was the Methodist tradition that inspired the Tolpuddle Martyrs, who, in protest at wage cuts, formed the first trade union.","Bishop praised Baroness Thatcher's courtesy and personal kindness .

The Liberal Democrats snatched a victory from the jaws of defeat yesterday after their most torrid week since coming to power. But Nick Clegg had to rely on Labour voters to do it after polling suggested he had benefited from tactical switching to try to stop the Tories winning. He hailed it a ‘stunning victory’, although the Lib Dems saw their majority cut in half. It came as the seat’s disgraced former MP Chris Huhne faces jail, former Lib Dem chief executive Lord Rennard is accused of molesting women and the party’s poll ratings nationally are their at lowest in years. Scraped through: Mike Thornton, pictured with his wife Peta Thornton at the Eastleigh by-election count, won his seat by just 1,771 votes . But analysis of the Eastleigh poll showed Lib Dems relied heavily on a lacklustre campaign by Labour. Twenty-three per cent of those who voted Labour at the last general election – around 1,800 voters – instead backed the Lib Dems, according to exit polling by Lord Ashcroft. Tactical voting was not encouraged by Labour, unlike in 2010 when senior figures hinted that people in marginal southern seats should vote Lib Dem where Labour had little chance . But the Lib Dem candidate, tax specialist Mike Thornton, clearly found Labour voters’ support crucial as he scraped through only 1,771 votes ahead of UKIP. UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Eastleigh candidate Diane James celebrates the party's second place finish in the by-election . All smiles: UKIP leader Nigel Farage emerged as one of the big winners of the night, claiming the result had 'stunned the establishment' Lib Dem president Tim Farron admitted that defeat by any margin would have been an ‘unspeakable catastrophe’ and would have fuelled critics who said the party was ‘going down the plughole’. He took the opportunity to attack claims that Lord Rennard made unwanted advances to a number of female activists as a ploy by the Press to derail the party’s chances. Mr Clegg said it showed his party was still able to win elections, even in ‘exceptionally difficult circumstances’. Mr Thornton said he was ‘absolutely exuberant’. Mr Farron said that up to 30 Tory seats were now vulnerable in the 2015 General Election. Gloomy faces: David Cameron admitted the defeat of Tory candidate Maria Hutchings, pictured at an event during the campaign, was 'disappointing' Against the odds: Mr Thornton's triumph came despite the resignation of ex-Cabinet minister Chris Huhne, who faces jail for perverting the course of justice, and the Lib Dems being caught up in sexual harassment claims against Lord Rennard .","Polls suggest Lib Dems benefited from tactical voting to stop Tories winning .

New guidelines from the General Medical Council say they can pursue such a romance as long as they use their ‘professional judgment’ to decide if it is appropriate. Until now, the watchdog has banned doctors from having relationships with any patients, even those they have not treated for some time. The General Medical Council's new guidelines allow doctors to start relationships with former patients . A number of senior doctors had warned that such partnerships were ‘flawed’ and risked under- mining the public’s trust in the profession. The guidance, issued yesterday, tells doctors they cannot initiate ‘sexual’ or ‘improper’ relationships with current patients. But it tells them they can date former patients, as long as they give ‘careful consideration’ to  certain factors. These include the number of  consultations they’d previously had with the patient and the length of time since their last appointment. It states: ‘If you are considering whether to pursue a personal relationship with a former patient, you must use your professional judgment. ‘Although it would not be possible to specify a length of time after which it is acceptable to pursue a relationship with a former patient, it is reasonable to expect that the more recently a professional  relationship ended the less likely  it is to be appropriate to begin a  personal relationship with the patient.’ The updated guidelines are contained within the doctors’ handbook, Good Medical Practice, and will come into force next month. Doctors should only start a relationship with a former patient if they have used their 'professional judgement' to decide if it is appropriate and are still banned from 'improper' relationships with current patients (file picture) Patient groups welcomed the change saying it was about time the watchdog moved into the 21st century. Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern,  said: ‘I don’t see any problem  with it if they are no longer their doctor. ‘I think it was all a bit of an old-fashioned idea quite honestly. ‘It seems sensible. They are getting into the 21st century and it’s a good updating.’ Some senior GPs, however, have previously warned that such  relationships are always ‘flawed’. Dr Surendra Kumar, a GP who practises in Widnes, Cheshire,  said: ‘Consider the powers of the doctor. This is the only profession of which a member can ask a  person to take their clothes off and find the request usually met with few questions and no resistance.’ In a previous interview with GP magazine Pulse, he said: ‘A proper emotional and sexual relationship is a partnership of equals, both  parties enjoying the same rights, privileges and limitations. ‘Any other basis for a relationship is flawed and needs to be criticised and resisted most vehemently. ‘It is vital proper boundaries are  maintained in relationships between doctors and patients.’ But Dr Tony Grewal, a senior  GP who practises in West London, said the watchdog ‘should not limit the capacity of two consenting adults to explore a relationship’.  Speaking to Pulse at the time, Dr Grewal added: ‘An absolute ban on sexual relationships with patients or former patients is an unfair  limitation on the right to pursue happiness for doctors and patients alike. ‘We need new, authoritative  public guidance which acknowledges the changes of the last 20 years, maintains the necessary safeguards for the vulnerable against exploitation or coercion, but gives a framework for those who wish to develop proper relationships.’ In 2011, a poll of 282 GPs by  Pulse found that half wanted the rules to be changed allowing them to have relationships with former patients. Some 2 per cent admitted they had begun relationships with patients they were still treating.","General Medical Council has issued new guidelines to doctors .

A suspected drink driver groped a policeman while offering him and a colleague a threesome as they tried to give her a breath test. Celina Hodge, 41, groped the officer’s genitals and buttocks after she was allegedly seen drinking vodka behind the wheel of her car. The two policemen were attempting to give her a breath test when she touched the officer and made a series of suggestive comments, Bristol Magistrates' Court heard. Hodge, of Hambrook, Bristol entered a guilty plea to one count of sexual assault but denied failing to provide a sample breath test. May Li, prosecuting, told the court that Hodge was ‘clearly drunk’ so police officers got her out of the car to perform the breath test. She said: ‘The officers received reports of a female drinking from a bottle of vodka at the wheel. ‘They located the vehicle where Mrs Hodge was sat in the driver's seat, with the engine off but the keys in the ignition, with a male passenger in the back seat. ‘Mrs Hodge told one officer: “You've got a good ass”. She rubbed her hands over the officer's buttocks and she told him she liked him.’ As she was being arrested, Hodge made sexually suggestive comments to the officers, including offers of sex, the court heard. Ms Li added: ‘She asked the officers: “Can't we go somewhere just the three of us?” 'She told the Pc he would be a good f*** and repeatedly attempted to rub his groin.’ Later, when officers attempted to get Hodge to give a breath sample at a police station, she began pleasuring herself during the incident on April 25. Ms Li said: ‘She took hold of the mouthpieces, looked at the CCTV camera, put her leg up on the counter.' The driver then started to touch herself while blowing into the alcohol tester, she added. Hodge spoke only to confirm her name and pleas during the ten minute hearing. She was granted unconditional bail to appear before the same court for the breath test trial on July 11. She will be sentenced for the sexual assault at a later date.

Bush was released from a Houston hospital and went home Monday after spending nearly two months being treated for a bronchitis-related cough and other health issues, a family spokesman said. Bush, 88, the nation's oldest living former president, was admitted to Methodist Hospital on Nov. 23. His stay included a week in intensive care last month. 'I am deeply grateful for the wonderful doctors and nurses at Methodist who took such good care of me,' Bush said in a statement released by spokesman Jim McGrath. Former President George HW Bush was released from hospital today after a two-month stay. He spends winters in Texas and watched the Houston Texans play the Buffalo Bills on November 4 2012 . 'Let me add just how touched we were by the many get-well messages we received from our friends and fellow Americans. Your prayers and good wishes helped more than you know, and as I head home my only concern is that I will not be able to thank each of you for your kind words.' Bush had been in the hospital for about a month before his office disclosed in late December that he was in intensive care because physicians were having difficulty controlling a fever that developed after the cough improved. His office said on Dec. 29 that he had been moved back to a regular hospital room. Since then, his condition has continued to improve and he has been undergoing physical therapy to rebuild his strength. George HW Bush (right) built a political dynasty. Here his son George W Bush (left), also a former president, helps his father during a ceremony aboard the aircraft carrier USS George HW Bush in June 2012 . 'Mr. Bush has improved to the point that he will not need any special medication when he goes home, but he will continue physical therapy,' Amy Mynderse, the doctor in charge of Bush's care, said in Monday's statement. Bush's office said he was treated for a bacterial infection, along with the bronchitis and cough. Bush and his wife, Barbara, live in Houston during the winter and spend their summers at a home in Kennebunkport, Maine. On Jan. 6, they celebrated their 68th wedding anniversary. They are the longest-married presidential couple. 'The problem now is he's no longer going to be hampered by all these nurses and health care providers in the hospital; now his caregiver is Barbara Bush,' Bush's son, Jeb, the former governor of Florida, joked Monday at an education forum in Nashville, Tenn. George HW Bush and Barbara Bush celebrated their 68th wedding anniversary in January. They are the longest-married presidential couple . 'Now I'm going to have to call my mother and apologize,' he quickly added. Bush had served two terms as Ronald Reagan's vice president when he was elected in 1988 to be the nation's 41st president. Four years later, after a term highlighted by the success of the 1991 Gulf War in Kuwait, he lost to Democrat Bill Clinton amid voter concerns about the economy. Bush has a long record of service, beginning with his enlistment in the Navy in World War II. At one point, he was the nation's youngest naval aviator. He was shot down in the Pacific and rescued by an American submarine. He's also been a congressman from Texas, U.S. ambassador to China and CIA director. He suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease that has forced him in recent years to use a motorized scooter or wheelchair to get around.","Former president was admitted to Methodist Hospital in Houston on November 23 .

'The first time I saw it I couldn't quite believe it - I thought I might be imagining it. 'But then I saw it again and again over the space of about a week. 'It seemed the Shetland mare had adopted the orphaned lamb and was letting it feed from her.' Ms Hirst said Shetlands are not normally amenable creatures and often struggle to rear foals. Equine vet Georgina Hirst said the lamb must have learned how to suckle from its adopted sibling, the foal . The family were broken up when the mother could not provide enough milk for both youngsters . She said: 'The lamb was obviously hungry and it's quite amazing that it learnt to suckle from the mare. It might have just copied the foal. 'Trying to get mares to adopt foals can be very challenging so it's incredible the mare was so receptive of the lamb. 'She would even stand guard while the foal and the lamb slept cuddled together.' However, despite the developing friendship, the vet decided to step in as it was clear the pony could not produce enough milk to sustain both her foal and the lamb. The lamb had an identity mark on it and Ms Hirst was able to track down the farmer. Ms Hirst said: 'After a while it became pretty clear that the deal wasn't really working. 'Both the lamb and the foal weren't looking as healthy as they should be due to a lack of food. 'The mare simply wasn't producing enough milk to feed the both of them. 'In the end we decided to flag up the problem to the farmer who took the lamb off the bluff to be bottle fed.'","The unlikely duo were spotted together in the Black Mountains in Wales .

"Many managers will get six-figure payoffs when they are made redundant . By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 19:39 EST, 19 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:30 EST, 20 March 2013 . NHS executives facing the axe are in line for bumper redundancy payoffs – and could walk back into Health Service jobs within a month, it has emerged. Sir David Nicholson wrote to staff whose posts will go as part of the health reforms explaining that they can be rehired by the NHS after four weeks. Many managers are set for six-figure payoffs when they are made redundant next month. Some are expected to receive more than £450,000. Sir David Nicholson wrote to staff whose posts will go as part of the health reforms explaining that they can be rehired by the NHS after four weeks . However, Sir David has urged them to wait at least six months before returning to work to avoid ‘reputational damage’ to the NHS. Yesterday it also emerged that 400 managers currently employed by the NHS earn more than the Prime Minister, who is on £142,500. Tory MP Nigel Ellis, who obtained the figures, said: ‘I accept that a person in a position of responsibility will need to be properly remunerated. ‘But for 400 managers to be paid more than the Prime Minister who has responsibility for running the country is ludicrous.’ But the revelation that those being made redundant could walk straight into new jobs – at a time when the NHS is under unprecedented financial pressure – is sure to fuel anger among patients. The letter is also further evidence that Sir David is presiding over a culture of secrecy within the NHS. It states: ‘I would ask these individuals to be mindful of this and of the possible reputational damage to themselves and to the NHS should they seek to gain paid employment or consultancy work in the NHS soon after they receive their redundancy payments.’ Already Sir David is suspected of presiding over a regime whereby hospitals routinely fiddle their figures and whistleblowers – such as Gary Walker, who said he was sacked as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust because of a row over an 18-week non-emergency waiting list target – are discouraged from speaking out. Last night Tory MP Charlotte Leslie said: ‘The tone of this letter does very little to persuade anyone who has concerns that Sir David is encouraging a culture of cover-ups. ‘It confirms exactly what has been behind all the problems we have seen with the Mid Staffordshire scandal. The reaction is always to try and bury bad news.’ Gary Walker, former chief executive of the United Lincolnshire hospitals NHS trust. He claims he was sacked because of a row over an 18-week non-emergency waiting list target . On April 1, thousands of managers and staff employed at Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities will be made redundant when these bodies are axed as part of the NHS reforms. Yet many will be re-employed by new, GP-led groups or recently-formed organisations such as the NHS Commissioning Board or Public Health England. Even so, the NHS is expected to spend more than a £1billion on their redundancy packages, with thousands of staff in line for six-figure sums. This is despite the fact the Health Service is trying to save money, with hospitals rationing non-urgent treatments and slashing nursing posts. Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It speaks volumes of the culture embodied by Sir David Nicholson that senior staff at the NHS are handed such huge pay-offs even if they may return only months later. ‘The NHS is overly bureaucratic with too many pen-pushers handed jobs for life. Cutting this bloated bureaucracy is vital but unnecessarily generous pay-offs will undermine efforts to trim the fat. ‘Ministers have forced the NHS to spend millions on managers’ pay-offs at the same time as thousands of nursing jobs are being axed. It’s a shameful waste of resources.’ Under NHS rules, managers will be given one month’s redundancy pay for every year they have worked. One, Sir Neil McKay, the chief executive of Midlands and East Strategic Health Authority, is reportedly set for a package worth £465,000.","Sir David Nicholson wrote to staff whose .

Single again: Ralf Little as Clint and Miranda Raison as Abbey, when they starred side by side in Married Single Other . She has already been in a relationship with one on-screen partner and dumped him after four years. Now history is repeating itself for former Spooks actress Miranda Raison, who has split from another co-star – Ralf Little – after another four years. The couple met on the set of ITV drama Married, Single, Other in 2009, where the actress played a model who captured the heart of Little’s character Clint, a serial womaniser. But now it appears that Miss Raison is back in the ‘single’ category after she ended the relationship last month. Last night spokesmen for both stars declined to comment on the break-up – which mirrors almost exactly Miss Raison’s previous relationship with her Spooks co-star Raza Jaffrey. The couple met in 2005 when Miss Raison was cast as journalist Jo Portman in the BBC spy drama. They formed a close bond as Mr Jaffrey’s character Zafar Younis, an undercover operative, fell for Miss Raison’s character after she was kidnapped, rescued and then recruited by MI5. The couple were married in September 2007 in Miss Raison’s home town of Aldeburgh, Suffolk, at the same time as Mr Jaffrey left Spooks. But by November 2009, the couple had separated, with sources claiming they found it difficult to adjust to life working on different shows. ‘When they spent all day and all night together on Spooks their relationship was fine, but after Raza left the show it all started to go terribly wrong,’ said one friend. Soon after the separation was revealed by The Mail on Sunday, Miss Raison was spotted out with Little. The couple were believed to have moved into his £500,000 North London home. In an interview in 2011, Little, 32, who got his big break playing dogsbody Antony in the BBC sitcom The Royle Family, spoke of his love for Miss Raison, also 32. Asked what was most important to him, fun, love or money, he replied:  ‘I have to say love, obviously – I’d land myself in hot water with my other half if I didn’t. If you’re having fun, you can love each other for ever.’ Before his relationship with Miss Raison, Little also dated TV presenter Lisa Rogers and actress Sarah Churm. Miranda Raison also dated and then married former Spooks co-star Raza Jaffrey .","The star of Spooks and Married, Single, Other has split with boyfriend Ralf Little after four years .

David Cameron is warning Nick Clegg he will get the blame if he blocks a temporary withdrawal from the European Convention of Human Rights to enable the deportation of Abu Qatada. Sources close to the Prime Minister made clear he would expect the Liberal Democrat leader – who has insisted he will not countenance any suspension of the ECHR – to explain to voters why the hate preacher remained in Britain in such circumstances. Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs yesterday that she has signed a new treaty with Abu Qatada’s native Jordan which, she believes, will mean the courts finally allowing his removal. Hate preacher Abu Qatada has been the subject of an on-going battle between the government and European Convention of Human Rights . But she said the Government was also examining a temporary suspension of the ECHR if all else failed. ‘I believe we should look at all the options and that should include leaving the jurisdiction of the court altogether,’ she told MPs. ‘The Prime Minister is  looking at all the options.’ Mr Clegg was kept in the dark about a ‘council of war’ ordered by Mr Cameron on Wednesday, as the Court of Appeal refused the Home Office permission to take Qatada’s case to the Supreme Court. The Premier told the Home Secretary, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Attorney General Dominic Grieve that it was ‘intolerable’ that Qatada remained in Britain. Today Mr Clegg ruled out changing the law to accelerate the process. He told LBC 97.3: 'No one’s proposed and certainly no one’s put to me this idea that we . should somehow suddenly start, I don’t know, pulling out of this or that . international agreement. He insisted: 'I want to get rid of Abu Qatada. I am as . impatient as anybody in the Government to do so. 'Of course this Government is not going to act illegally.' However, he added that he was 'quietly a little bit more optimistic' that Britain would kick Qatada out and praised Mrs May for doing a 'fantastically good job'. Tussle: Nick Clegg, pictured today visiting the Stockwell Park Estate in Brixton, was kept in the dark about a 'council of war' ordered by David Cameron . Mr Grieve is also nderstood to be . fiercely opposed to any move to leave the ECHR, and Kenneth Clarke, the . Cabinet Office minister, publicly dismissed the idea. Mr Clarke, a former Lord Chancellor, . said: ‘It’s not the policy of this government to withdraw either from a . short period or for a lengthy period from the European Convention on . Human Rights.’ Even if the UK did withdraw, he added, it would have little impact on the Qatada case because English common law would prevent his deportation if there was a risk of torture. The Home Secretary said a treaty containing a 'fair trials guarantee' had been struck with Jordan . ‘You’re not going to get a British court to deport anybody for trial to a country where torture is going to be involved, you never have, you never will,’ Mr Clarke said. A Downing Street source, however, insisted Mr Cameron was ‘deadly serious’ about a temporary withdrawal from the convention if the courts refused to accept the new treaty. The source added: ‘The Prime Minister is willing to see every  avenue pursued. This is a priority for him and for the British people. ‘Frankly, if anyone wants to be the person that keeps Abu Qatada in this country then they will need to stand up and make that argument.’ In the Commons, the Home Secretary said a treaty containing a ‘fair trials guarantee’ had been struck with Jordan and would reassure UK courts that torture evidence would not be used against the terrorist suspect. But she warned: ‘Even when the treaty is fully ratified, it will not mean that Qatada will be on a plane to Jordan within days. ‘We will be able to issue a new deportation decision, but Qatada will still have legal appeals available to him, and it will therefore be up to the courts to make the final decision. That legal process may well still take many months, but in the meantime I believe Qatada should remain behind bars.’ Several Tory MPs suggested that the Government should simply ignore the Strasbourg and British courts and deport Qatada anyway. Mrs May said: ‘The answer I give is the same as I have given in the past – I believe the UK Government should abide by the rule of law.’ Qatada is accused of plotting a terrorist atrocity in Jordan to coincide with the Millennium. His removal to stand trial there was originally approved by the British courts, only to be overruled by the European Court of Human Rights last year. Strasbourg judges said they feared he would not get a fair trial because evidence obtained through torture might be used against him. The Home Secretary then sought assurances from Jordan that there would be no use of torture, but an immigration tribunal ruled the assurances were not reliable and halted his removal. Qatada, who has been resident in the UK since September 1993, was returned to jail earlier this month after he was arrested for alleged bail breaches.","Home Secretary says treaty with 'fair trials guarantee' has been struck with Jordan .

Concerns: Schools minister Elizabeth Truss claims half of all stay-at-home mothers want to work . Half of all stay-at-home mothers want to go out to work and the government is right to target tax breaks at working women, the education minister said last night. Elizabeth Truss said two-earner families were ‘now the norm’ and said she was concerned mothers were ‘made to feel guilty’ when they had no choice but to go out to work for financial reasons. Miss Truss, a 37-year-old mother-of-two, said Margaret Thatcher was ‘the original working mum’ and would support the Government’s efforts to enable more women to go into work by helping with the cost of childcare. ‘I think it is a problem where 50 per cent of stay-at-home mums say that they want to go out to work and can’t afford the childcare,’ she told the BBC’s Newsnight programme. ‘Two-thirds of mums in Britain go out to work - for economic reasons, and this is a trend across the world. Dual income families are now the norm. ‘I’m very concerned those mums are made to feel guilty about a choice they don’t really have. In a country like France, with very high quality early education, parents do feel less guilty, it’s more of a normal thing.’ Some Tory MPs and a new pressure group, Mothers at Home Matter, have criticised the Government’s policies on tax and childcare and risk the ‘cohesion of society’ by undermining the one earner family. Last month’s Budget confirmed the Government’s plans to reduce child benefit from families with a single earner on £50,000, and axe it altogether for those with one on £60,000. Two earner couples who each earn just under those thresholds will be able to keep on claiming. While the Government has set out plans to offer tax breaks worth £1,200 per child for working couples, to come into effect from 2015, a long-promised tax break for marriage, which would benefit both single and dual earner families, has yet to materialise. Juggling act: MissTruss said many mothers were 'made to feel guilty' when they had no choice but to go out to work for financial reasons . Miss Truss insisted the Government was . not discriminating against stay-at-home mothers by reducing child . benefit for the top 15 per cent of earners. ‘What we’re saying is, why should someone who works at Tesco on a shift, why should they pay to support people who are very well off? That’s not right. What we’re doing is we are targeting resources on where it is needed most,’ she said. The minister said Baroness Thatcher was ‘the original working mum and she introduced independent taxation for women which was a massive reform in its day’. ‘Rather than saying married women should be taxed according to their husband’s income, [she] actually said women’s income is valuable in itself. And that was a major change. She was very supportive. Margaret Thatcher pictured with her children Mark and Carol in 1959. Miss Truss described the late former Prime Minister as 'the original working mum' ‘It is obviously true that having a higher maternal employment rate does help a country’s GDP. That’s a decision Germany made when they had one of the lowest maternal employment rates. They were educating a lot of women and finding that they were dropping out of the labour force simply because the school day was half as long as in Britain such that they were not able to go out to work. Germany has now changed its system.’ Miss Truss repeated her criticism of pre-school education in Britain, insisting more nurseries should adopt the more formal French model where children have structured sessions led by a graduate-level teacher.","Elizabeth Truss said half of all stay-at-home mothers want to go out to work .

Twenty-three teenagers have died in the past nine days at initiation ceremonies that include circumcisions and survival tests, South African police said Friday. Police have opened 22 murder cases in the deaths in the northeastern province of Mpumalanga, according to spokesman Lt. Col. Leonard Hlathi. He said an inquest is being held into the 23rd death, of a youth who complained of stomach pains and vomited. Initiation ceremonies are common in South Africa, where youths partake in various activities as a rite of passage into adulthood, usually over the course of three weeks. Some 30,000 youths signed up for initiation this year. Rite or wrong? Initiation ceremonies are common in South Africa, where youths partake in various activities as a rite of passage into adulthood, their faces are painted with red or white clay and they also are given herbal concoctions to drink . In addition to being circumcised, the boys and young men are put through a series of survival tests which sometimes include exposure to South Africa's chilly winter conditions with skimpy clothing.

Spiritual: Nelson Mandela described the experience in his autobiography as 'a kind of spiritual preparation for the trials of manhood' Mathibela Mokoena, chairman of the House of Traditional Leaders in Mpumalanga, says the Department of Health was alerted before the initiation ceremonies began, but only showed up after the first few deaths were reported. He said the department has now agreed to have officials present for the remainder of the ceremony. It was not immediately possible to get a response from the department. The department spokesman was on a plane, an assistant said. The minister's spokesman did not answer his phone or respond to a telephone message. The deaths are the highest recorded in Mpumalanga, surpassing the previous highest toll of eight some years ago, Mokoena said. He said early investigation by the House of Traditional Leaders showed some schools were negligent, leaving the youths in the care of young men instead of experienced adults. Mokoena said some of the initiates were not in ideal health when they enrolled. He said new legislation is being introduced outlining procedures to be followed, and including a punishment of a life ban for those found negligent. The suspected causes of the deaths were not released pending the results of post-mortems. Most deaths in the past have been caused by infection and loss of blood after circumcision. Government spokeswoman Phumla Williams said the government is sending condolences to the families and urged creation of 'better and safe initiation schools that will ensure the safe passage of young initiates to manhood and prevent the unfortunate loss of lives.'","Police have open 22 murder cases in northeastern province of Mpumalanga .

Doctors from the Dent Neurological Institute have tested the teenage victims for paediatric acute-onset neuropsychaitric syndrome, or PANS, which they singled out as a solution. One specialist, Dr Rosario Trifiletti, has already ruled this diagnosis out, however, saying instead that it is a case of mass hysteria and conversion disorder or walking pneumonia though that is extremely uncommon over the age of 11. Psychological .

School . administrators do not agree, and have insisted it is not a case of mass hysteria and that none of the . girls are making the illness or symptoms up. They would not disclose any other possible explanation. Environmental . The geographic specificity of the case and rapid spread piqued the interest of environmental campaigner and lawyer, Erin Brockovich, who made her name from a case involving a cancer-causing oil leak in California. She has suggested that a . chemical spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the . school may be the cause. Critics have said that Brockovich's involvement will only serve to increase the mass hysteria. The disease, once called PANDAS (paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection), first manifested in children who developed OCD after having a bout of strep throat. According to WIVB.com, doctors from the Dent Neurological Institute have met with some of the students. Dr Rosario Trifiletti will be running tests for PANS, the results of which will be ready in one to two weeks. He . is a specialist in PANDAS and says walking pneumonia may be to blame, . though the disease is extremely rare in patients over 11, as WGRZ . reported. The neurologist . who has been treating the teenagers ruled out PANDAS soon after . examining them and diagnosed them with conversion disorder. Dr . Trifiletti calls the diagnosis ‘absolute garbage,’ but adds if they do . have a form of walking pneumonia, the infection is treatable with a . simple antibiotic, like a Z-Pack. Earlier last month, it was reported . that 12 female students, who all attend Le Roy High School, in New York, . had been diagnosed and were being treated for the unexplained illness. That number has now risen to 15 teenagers and they are all reportedly suffering from verbal outbursts and involuntary twitches. One of the teenagers affected, . 16-year-old Lori Brownell, posted a video on YouTube discussing how her . symptoms started last August and looking for help from anyone who might . explain her condition. She has not been able to attend school since the tics started and the seizures were becoming more frequent. Thera Sanchez, 17, has had the symptoms for months and is constantly plagued by the immobilizing tics. 'I’ve . had psychological treatment. They say this is stress induced. My . psychological treatment …. That’s all they do is stress me out more,' she said. Campaigning lawyer and environmental activist Erin Brockovich is now looking into the case. In . 1996, Brockovich fought and won a mass lawsuit for an estimated $333 . million dollars against Pacific Gas and Electric, who allegedly . contaminated drinking water in the town of Hinkley, California. Examined: A team of Brockovich's non-profit team took samples from the area to test it for environmental toxins . Worrisome: The outbreak has turned national attention on the small upstate New York town . Brockovich, who was the inspiration . for the eponymous film starring Julia Roberts, has already started investigating. 'We don’t have all the answers, but we . are suspicious. They have not ruled everything out yet. The community . asked us to help, and this is what we do.' -Erin Brockovich . She has suggested that a . chemical spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the . school may be the cause. She has sent scientists to . collect soil samples around the high school. 'When . I read reports like this that the New York Department of Health and . state agencies were well-aware of the spill and you don’t do water . testing or vapor extraction tests, you don’t have an all-clear,' she . said. According to a . 1999 report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, almost one . tonne of cyanide crystals spilled to the ground in the derailment, along . with 130,000 litres of trichloroethene. The crystals were removed but the trichloroethene was absorbed into the ground. Brockovich said she has received more than one hundred emails about the school. Trying to understand: Thera Sanchez, 17, has had the mysterious symptoms for months and all of the treatments he has received have not helped to clarify any options for her or her family . She . said: 'We don’t have all the answers, but we are suspicious. They have . not ruled everything out yet. The community asked us to help, and this . is what we do.' Critics of . Brockovich say that she is only hurting the cause by instilling more . fear and mass hysteria in the area which is already filled with a bevy . of questions and no answers.

Earlier this month, the school held a . forum for concerned parents. About 150 people attended, demanding to . know what was wrong with the students. Dr . Greg Young, with the NYS Department of Health, said: 'I can assure you . these children have all been seen by professionals that have come up . with answers and they are all being treated and they're actually doing . pretty well.' He revealed . that tics like this can be caused by a number of factors such as . genetics, head trauma, drugs for ADHD and OCD and antihistamines. Through . tests over the last few months, they have been able to rule out a . number of environmental factors, infections, illegal drugs and carbon . monoxide poisoning.

Every family will be up to £3,500 worse off if Britain leaves the European Union, business leaders including the heads of BT, Shell and Eurostar warned today. Euorsceptic Tories calling for withdrawal from Brussels are accused of putting ‘politics before economics’, with EU membership worth between £31billion and £92billion a year to the UK. Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, Sir Win Bischoff  chairman of Lloyds Banking Group and Sir Martin Sorrell of global advertising firm WPP are among 20 business chiefs who signed an open letter on the need to ‘promote the cause of EU membership’. Making the case: Leading business figures including WPP's Sir Martin Sorrell (left) and Virgin's Sir Richard Branson accused Eurosceptics of putting 'politics before economics' and argued Britain should stay in the EU . David Cameron’s leadership has been thrown off course by the issue of Europe. Having once told the Tory party to stop ‘banging on’ about Brussels, he has since promise to renegotiate a new deal for Britain for staging an in-out referendum if he is PM after the next election. But two Cabinet ministers – Michael Gove and Philip Hammond – went public last week with their view that Britain should leave the EU if a referendum was held now. And 114 Tory MPs defied the party leadership last week to back an amendment to the Queen’s Speech expressing ‘regret’ at the absence of legislation on holding a referendum. David Cameron's leadership has been rocked by the issue of Europe . Now 20 business leaders, including the current and next presidents of the CBI have hit back at the growing tide of Euorscepticism, insisting more must be done to put the case for remaining in the EU. In an open letter to The Independent they argue that the ‘economic case to stay in the EU is overwhelming’. Membership of the EU is estimated to be worth between £31billion and £92billionn per year in income gains, or between £1,200 to £3,500 for every household, the letter adds. ‘What we should now be doing is fighting hard to deliver a more competitive Europe, to combat the criticism of those that champion our departure. ‘We should promote the cause of EU membership as well as defend our position. ‘The benefits of membership overwhelmingly outweigh the costs, and to suggest otherwise is putting politics before economics.’ Along with Roland Rudd, the chairman of Business for New Europe, the letter has also been signed by senior figures from UBM, Centrica, Nomura, Deloitte, Corsair Capital, ASA International, Scottish Power, 3i, Rothschild, Key Safety Systems Inc, Clifford Chance and Renshaw Bay. Mr Cameron’s position on Europe was criticised by former Tory Chancellor Lord Howe who said the Prime Minister was in danger of losing control of his party as the Conservatives' long, nervous breakdown’ over Europe continued. But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted that the Tory party was absolutely united’ on the issue of Europe and Lord Howe's views did not ‘represent the reality’ of the situation.","EU membership worth up to £92billion to Britain, open letter claims .

Unhappy: Embattled Tory chairman Lord Feldman has angrily denied making the comments and hinted that he may sue over newspaper reports . Embattled Tory chairman Lord Feldman is to avoid a party investigation into claims he described grassroots activists as ‘mad, swivel-eyed loons’. The peer, one of David Cameron’s closest friends in politics, has angrily denied making the comments and hinted that he may sue over newspaper reports. Today the Conservative Party Board rejected calls from senior backbencher Brian Binley for an internal investigation into the claims. Downing Street has weighed in behind him, saying the Prime Minister accepts his assurances that he did not make the comments to journalists he encountered in a Westminster restaurant last week. But some senior Tories last night cast doubt on his denials, and he faced close interrogation over the affair when the Conservative Party board held its monthly meeting in London this afternoon. Ahead of the meeting Mr Binley said: ‘I simply do not believe that senior journalists would make up such a remark. ‘I’m afraid that among the leadership there has been a disdainful view of the voluntary party. I have made that complaint again and again. ‘I am certainly going to be raising it at the party board meeting – it is so insulting. I want answers.’ Former Conservative Cabinet minister David Mellor said Lord Feldman should follow through on his threat to sue if he genuinely did not use the contemptuous phrase. Mr Mellor said: ‘He strenuously denies it but, if so, I have to say as a former lawyer . . . sue them. Where is the writ? I think we will find the writ will not appear.’ Newspaper accounts on Saturday did not name Lord Feldman, but said the source of the story had ‘strong social connections to the Prime Minister and close links to the party machine’. Lord Feldman is reported to have dismissed last week’s Tory rebellion on Europe, saying: ‘It’s fine – there’s really no problem. The MPs just have to do it because the associations tell them to do it, and the associations are all mad, swivel-eyed loons.’ Hours later Lord Feldman issued a statement denying he had made the comments, after he was named on Twitter as the likely source. 'Where's the writ?': Former Conservative Cabinet minister David Mellor said Lord Feldman should follow through on his threat to sue if he genuinely did not use the contemptuous phrase . He said: ‘This is completely untrue. I did not nor have ever described our associations in this way or in any similar manner. Nor do these alleged comments represent my views of our activists.’ Lord Feldman, 47, is one of the Prime Minister’s closest political allies. The pair met at Oxford and have remained friends and tennis partners for years. Lord Feldman was made co-chairman of the party in 2010 and handed a peerage later that year. Downing Street said Mr Cameron backed his friend and believed his denials. A No 10 source said: ‘We absolutely believe Andrew. It is completely untrue that anyone in Downing Street has made those comments or held those views.’ Another senior figure close to the discussions about Lord Feldman acknowledged he could be a ‘bit of a blabbermouth’, but insisted he would not lie. The source added: ‘Did he say something a bit injudicious? Possibly. Did he say what’s been ascribed to him? Nobody thinks so. ‘He insists that he did not say those words. Andrew is nothing if not honest. The Prime Minister has known him for years and he believes his account.’ Friends: Lord Feldman is one of the Prime Minister David Cameron's closest political allies . The Times and the Daily Telegraph, which both reported the story on their front pages on Saturday, said they stood by their stories. Ben Harris-Quinney, director of the organisation Conservative Grassroots, said there was now a ‘crisis of conservatism’, with the leadership disconnected from the party on issues like gay marriage and Europe. Mr Harris-Quinney said: ‘It doesn’t matter who made these comments, the problem is that it comes as no surprise and is representative of a wider malaise in the party – the disconnect between the leadership and the grassroots, between conservatism and the leadership of the Conservative Party. ‘The tail cannot continue to wag the dog. We need to drop or heavily amend policies like gay marriage that aren’t conservative.’ Senior Tories last night said there was unlikely to be any action against Lord Feldman. One said: ‘Even if he did say it, which he denies, the fact is Andrew is the Prime Minister’s friend and confidante. He also raises a lot of money for the central party and keeps the Cameron operation afloat. ‘We literally cannot afford to lose him, which is what makes the whole thing so complicated and difficult.’ Mr Mellor suggested the Prime Minister was wrong to appoint a personal friend to such a senior role. ‘I am old enough to remember the days when the Tory Party chairman was a serious political figure and  chosen because they were a serious political figure,’ he said. ‘If it was him – as newspapers suggest – then this has been a disaster waiting to happen because you cannot elevate  tennis-playing friends to be chairman of the Conservative Party without there being a political price to pay.’","Lord Feldman angrily denied making comments and hinted he may sue .

While the East Coast basks in relatively warm weather for mid-January, California is being hit with a blistering cold front. The unusually frigid weather has brought snowstorms and temperatures below 30 degrees to the Pacific Coast state, alarming motorists, farmers and zookeepers, among others. The California Highway Patrol on Friday partially reopened a 40-mile stretch of Interstate 5, north of Los Angeles, that was closed by snow as the cold snap sent temperatures plummeting throughout the state. Unexpected snowstorm: Snowy, foggy weather in the Southern California mountains has closed an inland road and briefly slowed traffic on a major north-south freeway . Traffic jam: Southbound Interstate 15 traffic comes to a near stand still near Oak Hill Road on Thursday January 10, 2013, after a winter storm brought snow and freezing rain to the Cajon Pass, Califorina . More on the way: Forecasters say an inch or two of snow is possible in the mountains, with the level dropping to 2,000 feet. There will be overnight frosts and freezes in colder valleys through the weekend . The CHP began escorting southbound cars through the Grapevine section of the major north-south route after a 16-hour shutdown that prompted hundreds of truckers and other motorists to pull over and spend the night by the side of the road. ‘There must have been 1,000 Mack trucks lined up,’ one motorist, Heidi Blood, 40, said early Friday.Blood and her three youngsters had been visiting Orange County and set out at 4.30am Friday to head back north to their home in Kentfield, California, when they found the road shut down. ‘I usually watch the news but I went to a spin class instead. I learned my lesson,’ she said. Blood had to give an insulin shot in the car to her 13-year-old blind, diabetic dog, Barney. To pass the time, the family watched movies and read on their iPads, turning on the car every 30 minutes to use the heater.

The highway through Tejon Pass rises to 4,100 feet in the Tehachapi Mountains and frequently is shut down in winter by blowing snow and treacherous black ice on the roadway. California remained in the grip of a cold snap that's expected to last through the weekend.Morning temperatures fell into the 20s and 30s in many areas, and much lower in the mountains. A low of 12 degrees was recorded in the Big Bear mountain resort east of Los Angeles. Strawberry growers covered their crops, while San Diego zookeepers turned on heaters for the chimpanzees.

Napa, in the wine country, and Sacramento, farther north, both recorded 27. High temperatures in the Central Valley over the weekend were forecast for 50 degrees, 3 degrees lower than normal for mid-January, according to the National Weather Service. In the south, forecasters warned that a low pressure trough sinking over San Diego County and parts of neighboring Orange County could keep nightly temperatures below the freezing point in coastal areas, the low deserts and inland valleys, threatening orange and avocado orchards and other sensitive plants. The coldest nights were expected to hit Friday and Saturday.

Isabelle Barrett, the clerk of Newmarket Town Council, in Suffolk, has been off work since March with an 'ongoing neck complaint' A town council has come under fire for spending £7,000 of taxpayers' money on a private neck operation for its clerk. Isabelle Barrett, the clerk of Newmarket Town Council, in Suffolk, has been off work since March with an 'ongoing neck complaint'. But instead of asking the deputy town clerk to replace her, the council voted to pay £6,900 for Mrs Barrett to have specialist surgery on her neck. Council leader and mayor Councillor George Lambton argued that Mrs Barrett, 45, would have had to wait six weeks to have the operation on the NHS. Three Labour councillors voted against the decision and said taxpayers' money should not have been used to get Mrs Barrett priority treatment. They accused the council of attempting to cover up the cost of the treatment by holding secret meetings to discuss it. And they said it was unfair for one employee to receive private healthcare when others do not. Local resident Sally Wilsoncroft, 67, of Newmarket, Suffolk, said: 'How dare councillors vote to spend our money on private healthcare for an employee? 'No doubt Isabelle Barrett is very good at her job - probably better than many of the councillors are at their job of running our town. 'If she has a painful problem she should use the NHS or, if she can afford to, use private medicine if she chooses.' Fellow resident Ted Landymore, 63, added: 'Would it not have been nicer and more appropriate to dip into their own pockets to aid their colleague, and not those of the over-taxed householders and rate payers?' The three Labour councillors who voted against paying for the treatment have called for the council to publish a full report on the issue. Mayor Lambton has since announced that the issue will be brought before the next full council meeting on May 23 where residents can voice their opinions. He said: 'We did it in order to give us the best chance of the town clerk returning to work as soon as possible. King Edward VII Memorial Hall, the home of Newmarket Town Council .

'We would have had to get in a replacement on a consultancy basis which would cost a considerable amount of money. 'Obviously there are a lot of unknowns in this. The operation has been a success but we have not heard when she will be back at work.' Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It's important that council staff are fit for work so that taxpayers are not paying a hefty amount of sick pay. 'However, taxpayers are right to question why exactly the council has forked out thousands for this private surgery. 'Local residents want to know that the money they pay in tax is being spent in the most cost effective manner so the town councillors have a lot of explaining to do as to why they splashed out on costly medical procedures.'","Town council clerk has been off work since March with neck complaint .

A new Earth-sized planet has been discovered orbiting a star just 352 light years away, but there’s very little chance of it hosting life because the surface is a toasty 1627C (2960F). Found lurking in the Kepler star field, it has been named Kepler-21b and its parent star – the snappily titled HD 179070 – is so close it can be viewed with a home telescope. This latest addition to our star charts was spotted by Nasa’s Earth-orbiting Kepler probe, which has found hundreds of new planets since its launch in 2009. Unblinking eye: This is Kepler's field of view superimposed on the night sky . Hi-tech: Nasa scientists working on the Kepler probe, which was launched in 2009 . As UK astronomer Dr Heather Couper acknowledges, the discovery of Kepler-21b is one more reason why these are such exciting time for star gazers. She told MailOnline: ‘The technology is getting really cool and the Kepler mission has been incredibly successful. ‘We’re now detecting lots of super-earths and Kepler-21b is one of them.’ Although similar in size to Earth, it only lies 3.7million miles from its parent star, so the chances of finding life there are incredibly remote. By comparison, Mercury is 35million miles from our Sun, and even that is too close for life. Dr Couper said: ‘Kepler-21b is only 1.6 times the radius of the Earth, so it’s probably a rocky planet. The problem is that it’s far too close to its parent star to sustain any life. ‘It goes round the star in 2.8 days, so it’s going to be be searingly hot. Mercury goes round in 88 days and that’s also searingly hot.’ Although Kepler-21b is a close neighbour in cosmic terms, it’s still difficult to spot. Dr Couper explains that the Kepler probe – along with ground-based telescopes to back it up – can't actually see planets, but works out they are there by looking for tell-tale blips in light from stars. Heavens above: The Kepler probe has found hundreds of new planets, with Kepler-21b the very latest . She said: ‘Kepler looks at the diminution of a star’s brightness when a planet passes in front it. If it’s regular you can work out its orbit.” There are now 704 confirmed exo-planets – bodies outside our solar system - and another 1,000 or so unconfirmed bodies. Dr Couper believes it’s only a matter of time before we find life. She added: ‘We’ve got every chance of finding a planet like Earth. When we find a new planet we ought to be tuning in to the star and listening to the radio signals from that planet. ‘If there are people on that planet they will probably be using radio waves to communicate. ‘The other crucial thing to do is to analyse the atmospheres of these planets. You can do this with spectroscopy, to see if there’s water present, which you need for life.’ The result of this week’s discovery will appear in the Astrophysical Journal.","Kepler-21b is 352 light years away and has surface temperatures of over 1,600C .

A former Army helicopter pilot is to become the first British astronaut to travel into space in more than 20 years. Details of Major Tim Peake’s five-month mission to the International Space Station will be released today by the European Space Agency. The 41-year-old is expected to be blasted into space on a Russian Soyuz rocket from Baikonur in Kazakhstan in November 2015. Tim Peake has been selected to go to the International Space Station for five months . The married father of two, who was . born in Chichester, West Sussex, will take part in spacewalks and . complex scientific research and experiments in the Columbus laboratory . module, which is attached to the front of the 400-ton space station. Major Peake is the only Briton ever . to be accepted into the European Astronaut Corps. His mission will make . him the first UK national to travel and work in space, under the Union . Jack, on a British Government-funded mission. Other British astronauts have either . secured private funding – such as Helen Sharman, who flew on a Russian . rocket in 1991 – or taken dual citizenship, such as Michael Foale and . Piers Sellers, who flew missions on the US space shuttle. Major Peake’s appointment is a major boost for the British space industry, which is experiencing something of a renaissance. Peake was one of six people to be chosen to be trained as astronauts in 2009 . He attends a video conference during his 12-day stay underwater as he trained . The UK is now the European Space .

Nick Spall, of the British Interplanetary Society, welcomed the news of Major’s Peake’s appointment. ‘The UK can now take its rightful place and join in with important . microgravity research work on the ISS, win industrial contracts for . future human space flight projects and forge new links via ESA with . Nasa, Russia and hopefully China – and, one day perhaps, India – in . space,’ he said. ‘With exciting potential mission . opportunities coming up for exploration across the solar system to . asteroids, the Moon, Mars and beyond for the future, many young people . will be inspired by Tim and his achievement. This will really help boost . the UK’s technical employment potential for jobs and industry. Human . space flight is a win-win initiative for the UK.’ Major Peake, who has been training . for the expedition since 2009, beat more than 8,000 hopefuls to be . selected along with five other colleagues from across Europe. It was thought that peake would have only a small role due to the UK's modest contributions to the Esa manned space programme . His 14-month training programme . included visits to Nasa’s astronaut base in Houston, the Russian . astronaut training centre in Star City outside Moscow, Tsukuba Space . Centre in Japan, and a two-week survival course in Sardinia. He has also . had to complete mock emergency exercises to see how he copes under . stress. Last year it emerged that he was one . of a team being trained to land on an asteroid to explore the surface, . search for minerals and even learn how they might be able to destroy it . should one pose a threat to the Earth.

The wife of Mick Philpott is to appeal the length of her 17 year sentence for killing her six children in a house fire, her lawyer said today. Mairead Philpott, 32, was jailed alongside her husband at Nottingham Crown Court last month after being found guilty of the manslaughter of children Jade, John, Jack, Jesse, Jayden and Duwayne. At the sentencing hearing, Mrs Justice Thirlwall told Mairead Philpott she had ignored 'obvious' risks to her children's lives by going along with a plan to set fire to her home in Allenton, Derby. Appeal: Mairead Philpott (left) was jailed for 17 years for killing her six children in a house fire . Speaking to BBC Radio Nottingham earlier today, defence barrister Shaun Smith QC confirmed that lawyers were planning to take the case to the Court of Appeal. Mr Smith, who represented Mairead Philpott during her trial, said of the 17-year jail term: 'We think it was too long and we are going to the Court of Appeal to see whether or not we can persuade the Court of Appeal to reduce the sentence. 'She was instrumental in killing six children, but we feel as though her role in the killing of the six children was not as substantial as the trial judge has assessed. Community in grief: The six dead children are carried into St Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Bridgegate, Derby, as they are laid to rest . Tragic end: Kind-hearted locals raised £15,000 for the funeral of Mick Philpott's six children (top row, l-r) Jayden, five, Jessie, six, Jack, eight, (bottom row, l-r) John, nine, Jade, 10, and Duwyane, 13 . 'We'll have to wait and see what the Court of Appeal say. It may well be that the Court of Appeal give us short shrift.' Mick Philpott was jailed for life with a minimum term of 15 years after being branded a 'disturbingly dangerous' man. His wife, who is likely to be released after serving half of her 17-year term, took part in a plan to set fire to the couple's home in Victory Road in an effort to frame his former mistress. Following the trial, Derbyshire Police said none of the defendants had shown any remorse for killing the children, who were aged between five and 13.

During his radio interview, Mr Smith described Mairead Philpott as being 'very scared' and 'very vulnerable'. The barrister told the BBC: 'She was clearly someone who had been in a horrendous relationship, as the court heard. 'She was someone who quite frankly was in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'It was a very upsetting case for everybody involved and I think it took a little piece out of me at the end of the day.'","Mairead Philpott was jailed for 17 years for killing her six children .

History remembers brilliant men who developed the atomic bomb that forced the surrender of Japan and won the Second World War. But, history seems to have forgotten the women of Atomic City. Without them, no atomic weapon would have been possible. Tens of thousands of young women from across the nation - white and black, college educated and high school dropouts, wealthy and poor - moved to a muddy boom town in the Appalachian Mountains in 1942 to work on the top-secret project of refining and enriching uranium. None of them knew exactly what was happening at Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. They were purposely kept in the dark about the nature of their work. They only knew that it was something that would help win the war. Shift change: These are the women who worked at the Y-12 plant, which used electromagnets to separate Uranium-235 from natural uranium ore . Anything you can do: Women performed a wide variety of tasks that were previously done only by men. Here, a woman fits pipe into a valve with a welding torch . Empowering: Women from poor and rural areas of the South and Midwest found good-paying jobs in Atomic City . Author Denise Kiernan offers the first comprehensive history of these pioneering workers of the Manhattan Project in her new book, 'The Girls of Atomic City: The Untold Story of the Women Who Help Win World War II.' It is published by Touchstone Books. For most women, Atomic City was empowering. Inspired by images of Rosie the Riveter and a shortage of men on the home-front, they were given jobs in hard labor, as well as math and science. More...

They wielded blow torches and Geiger counters and were taught skills that would have been nearly unimaginable before the war. Atomic City was a boom town unlike any seen before. In 1942 there were 3,000 residents living in the mountainside hollers and woods. By 1945, more than 75,000 workers toiled day and night. Top secret: Signs around the compound warned workers not to talk about what they hear and saw at the nuclear facility . Separate and unequal: Black women were also recruited to work in the plant, though they were forced to live in huts and were not allowed to live with their spouses or bring their children - unlike white women . Atomic age: Women worked in the same labs and factories as men - often doing many of the same jobs. Here is the exterior of one of those plants . Untold story: Denise Kiernan's new book offers an in-depth tail of the women who helped win the war . Shops and bunk houses, homes and roads sprang out of the Tennessee clay mud. By war's end, the town had one of the largest bus systems in the nation - ferrying workers to their top-secret jobs. But it wasn't on any map, . Kiernan tells the story of the secret city through the eyes of nine living Atomic City girls who watched the town grow and unfold in front of them. Celia Szapka was a Polish Catholic girl who fled a coal mining town in Pennsylvania in search of good work. She rose to become a personal secretary for some of the top leaders of Oak Ridge. Kattie Strickland left her three children in Alabama so she could make money to send home. Katie and her husband were not allowed to live together because they were black. And her black babies were not welcome on the compound either. Jane Greer is the daughter of a wealthy Tennessee businessman who, when she tried to apply for an engineering degree at the University of Tennessee, was told that the school 'did not matriculate girls for engineering.' She studied statistics instead and eventually led a team of women who tracked uranium production. 'It was the others, the great and often unseen, who made the theories of scientists a reality,' Kiernan writes. 'Tens of thousands of individuals - some still reeling from the Depression, others gripped by anxiety and fear as loved ones fought overseas in the most devastating war any of them had known - worked around the clock on this project, the details of which were not explained.' Despite the empowerment and the high-paying jobs, the women couldn't entirely break out of the 1940s gender roles. The leaders of the base were all men and men called all of the shots. Toni Peters, whose family was kicked off a farm in Oak Ride they had owned for generations to make way for the new facility, remembers being barked at by her 'big 'ole Yankee' boss when she first approached the base for a job. When she tried to take dictation from him, she recalls, she 'couldn't understand who words he said.' Her dictation pad included numerous blank words as she tried to understand his northern dialect. When the boss realized this, he admitted that he could hardly understand her, either. Peters got the job anyway. Secrecy was most important. Signs like 'What you see here, what you do here, what you hear here, when you leave here - LET IT STAY HERE' dotted the compound. Workers were forbidden from speaking about what work they did. Instead, the common question was 'Where are you from?' Indeed, it was not until August 1945 - after the atomic bomb Little Boy . was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, killing 166,000 - that the workers . found out what their efforts had made possible. When she found out, Peters remembers exclaiming: 'It's a bomb!' Home comforts: It wasn't just nuclear physics being done at Oak Ridge. Here the women are pictured during a home economics class . Boom town: The military built Atomic City from the ground up. In 1942 is was home to 3,000 rural farmers. By 1945, more than 75,000 worked in the factories .

Foul language and inappropriate themes on Britain’s Got Talent and other pre-watershed programmes are robbing children of their innocence, headteachers have warned. Adult issues including prostitution, rape, alcoholism and murder are now commonplace on screens before 9pm. This is having a ‘detrimental effect’ on children, according to a motion passed overwhelmingly at the National Association of Headteachers conference in Birmingham. Britain’s Got Talent, which featured . 71-year-old pensioner Kelly Fox earlier this month singing a song . shortly after 8pm called ‘Kiss My Ass’, was singled out for criticism. Music mogul Simon Cowell also kissed the bottom of fellow judge Amanda Holden. Controversial: Simon Cowell plants a big kiss on Amanda Holden's bottom during during an episode of Britian's Got Talent earlier this month . Amanda Hulme, the head of Claypool Primary School in Bolton, told delegates children are being forced to grow up too quickly. Lyrics: Sandra Broadbent, 71, who performing under the name Kelly Fox, sang the words 'you were lying there butt naked with a woman between your thighs' on BGT . ‘Completely inappropriate’ material that no person ‘with an ounce of morality’ would want their child to see were being shown too early. Speaking about the 'Kiss My Ass' incident, she said: 'The producers of Britain’s Got Talent obviously think it’s okay. They made a conscious decision to air that performance before the watershed last Saturday,’ she said. The programme had already been criticised recently for featuring a lap dancer and an 11-year-old singing a sexually charged song called One Night Only, both seen by 13 million people before the watershed. Popular soaps were also a bad influence, Mrs Hulme said, with Emmerdale character Cain Dingle using bad language in an episode broadcast at 7.20pm. Referring to a recent Netmums survey which found parents believe childhood now ends at age 12, she added: ‘It’s even lower than that for some children. ‘The toxic combination of sophisticated marketing, the media ratings war and added peer pressure linked to social media, means that not only are children being put under pressure to conform to idealistic nonsense but they are also being subjected to adult themes at a much younger age.’ She described having to speak to 11-year-olds about making crude language in the playground. ‘What does seem to be new is the freedom that the media have to introduce themes to our children that are completely inappropriate - rape, murder, domestic abuse, child abuse, self-harming, bulimia, alcoholism, prostitution, drug abuse - all on television in the last 12 months and all before the watershed,’ Mrs Hulme warned. ‘Surely an easy way to judge if a theme is appropriate would be to ask the question “Is this something I would like my child to know about?”’ Another headteacher described how children as young as eight are putting themselves at risk by setting up Facebook pages. Risks: Headteachers also described how children as young as eight are putting themselves at risk by setting up Facebook pages . Stephen Watkins, head of Mill Field Primary School in Leeds, revealed more than two-thirds of 11-year-olds at his school had set up accounts on the social networking site - despite under-13s supposedly being banned. Many were placing sensitive details online, including their names and addresses - which could be seen by predatory paedophiles. Others are being subjected to cyber-bullying, leaving them suicidal or with eating disorders, he said in a briefing prior to the conference in Birmingham. ‘We had a purge just before Christmas when we wrote to the parents telling them their children were not old enough,’ said Mr Watkins. ‘We told them “Do something or we will”. Then, a couple of months later, we found they had set up new accounts under a different name.’ Facebook did remove under-age accounts when alerted to them, he said, ‘but they don’t make it difficult to set them up’. Mr Hobby confirmed the problem was ‘rife’, saying a ‘majority of schools’ were now having to tackle the problem. A Facebook spokesman said: ‘Ultimately, we believe that communication between parents and young people about their use of the internet is vital.’","Teachers complain prostitution, rape, and murder is common before 9pm .

Local authorities said Paul Towning, 51, was with a group of six divers taking part in a week long programme involving several deep water explorations on ships that had been sunk during World War Two. Coastguard officials said that Mr Towning had been diving at a depth of around 90 metres when he got into difficulty. He died shortly after reaching the surface of the water. Deep water exploration: The Bengasi attracts divers such as this one - not a part of Mr Towning's group - from around the world . The wreck is about a mile from the uninhabited Isola dei Cavoli and is described as 'one of the most beautiful wrecks in the Mediterranean' Paramedics were immediately called to the scene near Villasimius on the south east coast of the Mediterranean island of Sardinia. Stefano Bianchelli, director of Prodive, said: 'It looks like he had some sort of attack while underwater and tragically he died as a result. The coastguards and police have impounded the tanks he was using but that's just a technicality as it looks like he had a heart attack. 'He was an experienced diver but this was his first time out here. He was in a group of other divers from France and his wife Jacqueline was on the mainland. She's very upset as you can imagine. 'When he came to the surface he was already out cold. We dragged him onto the boat and I carried out a heart massage and gave him oxygen but sadly there was nothing we could do.' Mr Towning, who was originally from Bolton but lived in South Yorkshire, arrived in Italy last week and he and the rest of the group were with instructors from a local firm called Pro Dive. The week long expedition involves diving on eight wrecks. The ship he was diving in was a steamship called the Bengasi, which was torpedoed by the Royal Navy's HMS Truant in May 1941 and sank within ten minutes of being struck. It was primarily used as a troopship but at the time was empty and sailing between its home port of Naples and the Sardinian city of Cagliari. Divers are drawn to the wreck because at the time it was sunk it was carrying a large cargo of glassware products. Idyllic: Crystal clear waters at Villasimius in Sardinia, Italy . The wreck is about a mile from the uninhabited Isola dei Cavoli. Pro Dive's website says: 'It is one of the most beautiful wreck (sic) in the Mediterranean sea: the holds loaded with glasses, the majesty of the screw and the poop cannon remain engraved on the diver's memory. It is a fascinating dive, but only for the very experienced divers.' Today, a coastguard spokesman in Cagliari said: 'We were called to an incident involving a group of divers who had been at the wreck of the Bengasi. 'It appears that one of them, a British man, was in difficulty and when he got to the surface he was already unconscious. 'The paramedics tried to save him but he was declared dead at the scene. It looks like he suffered a heart attack.' Mr Towning's body is expected to be moved to Cagliari, where a magistrate will decide if a post mortem should be held. A British Embassy spokesman in Rome said: 'We are unaware of this but will look into it.' A man who answered the phone at Pro Dive said: 'I can't really say anything at the moment.' The Bengasi has been at the centre of controversy before when three Italian divers were charged with stealing items of a historical nature - glasses from the hold - but they were later cleared.","Man is named by local authorities as Paul Towning, from South Yorkshire .

A leafy idyll nicknamed Britain's Beverly Hills, which is home to Elton John, Gary Lineker and Jenson Button, pays more income tax than any other area of the UK, it was revealed today. The tax man receives £1.18billon a year from residents of Elmbridge, twice the amount drawn from Cardiff and Newcastle combined, and 200 times more than from Google. Its nearest rival is Glasgow, whose 600,000 residents pay £220million less in income tax than the 130,000 people living in the 37.2 square mile area south-west of London. Tax yield: Elmbridge's 130,000 residents pay exceptional levels of tax even when compared to Britain's major cities . Luxurious: The riverside homes in Elmbridge, which is west of London, has attracted Britain's richest people and pays more income tax than any other area of the UK . Stars: Gary Lineker and his wife Danielle, as well as musicians like Ronnie Wood have made Elmbridge borough their home . Elmbridge's famous residents moved along the Thames to get away from the capital, and live in and around its principal towns of Esher, Walton on Thames and Weybridge. Those include Jamie Redknapp and his wife Louise, Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, broadcaster Chris Tarrant, tennis player Andy Murray and footballers John Terry and Frank Lampard. Their income tax bills help put Elmbridge at number one in the UK, followed by Glasgow on £898million, Sheffield on £812million, oil and gas-rich Aberdeen's £728million, Cardiff's £589million and Newcastle's £443million, according to accountancy group UHY Hacker Young. Couples: Former Liverpool star Jamie Redknapp, pictured with wife Louise, and Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard, pictured with partner Christine Bleakley, are both said to own property in Elmbridge borough . The figures show the scale of the north-south wealth divide, with the top ten all in the south-east of Britain. 'There is a growing . regional mismatch, with wealth and tax bills . becoming concentrated within a handful of cities home to lucrative . industries, or a collection of leafy suburbs,'  Head of Private Client Services Mark Giddens said. 'Governments have attempted to boost the . attractiveness of other regions in the UK to top earners, even . encouraging some public sector organisations to relocate to different . parts of the UK. However, the pull of the South East, culturally, . politically, and financially is still very strong for the highest . earners. 'People assume that foreign High Net Worths live exclusively in . Knightsbridge and Chelsea, but actually the figures suggest many have . moved out into Surrey.' Different picture: Residents of cities like Stoke-on-Trent (pictured), are among those who are paying the least income tax . Struggling: The average person in Hull (pictured) pays around £2,500 in income tax, when Elmbridge residents pay £16,100 . Elmbridge's residents pay an average of £16,100 in tax per year, £11,702 higher than the UK average of £4,398, says UHY Hacker Young, the national accountancy group. At the bottom was Blackpool, whose population pay £2,490 annually, which is on a par with Stoke-on-Trent and just behind Kingston-upon-Hull on  £2,560. On average people moving to Elmbridge pay £378,823 for a home, twice the national average of £164,000, and has 11 streets in the most expensive places to buy a house in the UK. Even the weather is better with less rainfall than the national average and also more sunshine than most of the UK. John O'Reilly, the Tory leader of Elmbridge Council, said: 'This is a good community, a diverse community and, like every resident in the country, we should pay what is due. 'And if we are doing our bit, it is not unreasonable to expect Google to do its bit. 'As a Conservative, I favour lower rates of tax, but what rates there are should be adhered to.

"She was found hanged at her home this month . By . Liz Hull . PUBLISHED: . 19:33 EST, 19 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:33 EST, 19 May 2013 . A leading barrister yesterday claimed he had been forced to stop working on cases involving the RSPCA because the charity tried to ‘ruin’ his life with spurious complaints. Cambridge-educated Jonathan Rich, who defended hundreds of people against the RSPCA over 20 years, said he has spent almost £1million defending professional allegations made by the charity about his conduct. He was a friend of Dawn Aubrey-Ward, 43, an RSPCA inspector turned whistleblower who also accused the charity of destroying her character. Cambridge-educated Jonathan Rich, who defended hundreds of people against the RSPCA over 20 years, said he has spent almost £1million defending professional allegations made by the charity . She was found hanged at her home this month. Yesterday Mr Rich, 46, said times had been ‘very tough’ and he might have suffered the same fate, were it not for his resolve and the love and support of his family. ‘I think the RSPCA were probably working on the basis that I wouldn’t be as strong as I proved to be,’ Mr Rich told the Daily Mail. ‘My insurers and I have spent a lot of money defending their claims and I’ve been through some very, very tough times, but I’ve got a  fantastic wife who has been very supportive and my family have got me through. ‘Other people faced with what I have had to contend with might well have killed themselves. ‘I am not ashamed to say I have been treated for reactive depression as a result of my ordeal. Two years ago I nearly died from a stress-related condition.’ Mr Rich, a contemporary of the Prime Minister at Eton and a Tory councillor, said problems began around 2003 when the  charity made the first of several formal and informal complaints linked to cases he was defending. ‘For two decades I had a superb track record, I won a lot of cases against the RSPCA, but it started to get vicious in the noughties,’ Mr Rich, a father of three, added. ‘I really believe everybody has the right to a defence and targeting a lawyer really is not a legitimate strategy. They set out  to ruin me. ‘While I would love to carry on I am very, very tired of fighting them. I felt I had no choice but to stop taking cases involving the RSPCA for my own well-being and that of  my family.’ Mr Rich’s comments will put further pressure on the charity, which has been criticised for recent high-profile, expensive legal cases and an aggressive publicity campaign. It is currently being investigated by the Charity Commission over its stance against badger culling and live animal exports. Last November Gavin Grant, chief executive of the RSPCA, wrote a Twitter message to Mr Rich, saying: ‘Please remind me why you no longer defend animal abusers against RSPCA prosecutions? We’ve +98% success rate as you know.’ The barrister, who also practises property and commercial law, said the tweet was indicative of an organisation that was concerned with animal rights ‘but has little regard for humanity’. In the past ten years the charity has made two direct complaints of professional misconduct against Mr Rich to the Bar Standards Board, while another nine have been made by people working on cases involving the RSPCA. The charity claims it played no role in these. Mr Rich, who has never had a  single complaint made about his conduct by any other organisation or individual in 24 years at the  Bar, said all had been dropped,  dismissed or struck out and he had never faced a full hearing. Three remain active. He and Miss Aubrey-Ward, whose character was publicly attacked  by the charity after she accused it of putting healthy dogs to sleep because they were deemed not suitable for rehoming, became friends because of their treatment by the RSPCA. ‘We were both going through the same sort of nightmare with the same assailant,’ Mr Rich said. ‘It was a relief for me to find  someone like her to talk to and she told me she felt the same. I feel a terrible sense of loss.’ A spokesman for the RSPCA said it made complaints only in ‘extreme circumstances and following established processes’. She added: ‘The RSPCA has secured nearly 10,000 convictions in the magistrates’ courts in the past three years alone and, to our knowledge, Mr Rich is the only  barrister the RSPCA has ever  complained about in terms of professional conduct.’ Last December the RSPCA was criticised by a judge after it emerged it had spent a ‘staggering’ £326,000 on a magistrates’ court prosecution against the Heythrop Hunt, David Cameron’s local hunt in Oxfordshire. Earlier this month another judge said it had wasted court time in a case concerning a hunt linked to a pro-hunting Tory councillor. The legal action cost the charity £50,000 but resulted in two fines of just £300.","Jonathan Rich, defended hundreds of people against RSPCA over 20 years .

A simple sign outside Sandy Hook Elementary School declares warmly: ‘Visitors Welcome.’ It was put up long before the school decided this year, in a flurry of concern about security, to lock all external doors to the outside world at 9.30am every morning. Not that Adam Lanza took any notice of the new protocol on Friday. Police say he ‘forced his way’ across the threshold, apparently smashing a glass door. Inside, 575 children aged from five to ten were excitedly preparing for a day of Christmas-themed activities. Scroll down for video . 9.10am: Adam Lanza shoots his mother Nancy dead at their £1million home in Newtown, Connecticut, and then takes her car . Pale and dressed in black, Lanza was closing in on them. From where he left his car to their classrooms is roughly 100 yards, and he covered the ground quickly. Before he could reach the children he first had to negotiate the entrance, and the staff sitting in meetings in rooms leading off it. In the normal way, they would not have been unduly disturbed by his appearance; many knew him as the ‘mild-mannered’ son of popular supply teacher Nancy Lanza. But on this occasion he was carrying four semi-automatic pistols, among them a Glock  and a 9mm Sig Sauer. And as  soon as he set foot inside the foyer he began firing. By 9.35am the worst school massacre in American history was over. In all, the shooting had lasted barely three minutes, but it left 20 children and six teachers and school staff dead. 9.32am: Adam Lanza arrives at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where his mother works and forced his way in . When the children had begun filing into school on Friday, Lanza had already murdered his mother at their four-bedroom home five miles away on hilly Yogananda Street, Newtown. Nancy Lanza  is also thought to have been shot. Afterwards, Lanza took the keys to her black Honda Civic and packed a .223-calibre Bushmaster rifle, often favoured by snipers, and the four pistols in the boot before driving to the school.  He set off at about 9.10am. In the event, for unknown reasons, he left the rifle in the car when he reached Sandy Hook. Once inside the main building, he cut down all who crossed  his path, shooting them, said surviving staff, ‘execution style’ from close range. At first, witnesses reported hearing a ‘pop pop pop’ sound from a hallway near classroom number nine. 9.35am: The shooting stops at the Sandy Hook Elementary School after only three minutes . Principal Dawn Hochsprung, 47, and school psychologist Mary Sherlach, who were in a meeting in a room just off the main foyer, bravely went to investigate. Others simply hid under desks. Probably known to Lanza, Mrs Sherlach had provided succour to generations of children, but at 56 was due to retire in a few months. He shot her dead without saying a word. In fact, he said nothing throughout the killing spree. Next, he turned his gun on Mrs Hochsprung, a widely admired leader and inspirational teacher. The two women – described  as the ‘very soul of our school’  – were later found lying over each other in a pool of blood. Within seconds the first call  to the emergency services was made by an unidentified female member of staff. After bursting through the door of a kindergarten class, Lanza,  in an act of unimaginable horror, began executing child after child. 9.45am: Armed police surround the school as the first SWAT team arrives on the scene . Youngsters hid in cupboards, barricaded themselves in toilets and huddled together in nooks and crannies as far from the shooting as they could reach. After Lanza wiped out one class, he moved on to the one next door. There he did the same before turning the gun on himself. By 9.45am, when the first SWAT team arrived, the shooting had been over for several minutes, though terrified children and teachers were still in hiding and had to be coaxed out by police. One teacher, Maryrose Kristopik, 50, was praised by parents for saving the lives of 15 children by hiding them in a closet. Outside, officers swarmed with dogs and roared overhead in helicopters. There were armoured cars and ambulances and, at nearby Danbury Hospital, doctors and nurses braced themselves for an onslaught  of wounded victims. But such was Lanza’s brutal efficiency that the influx never came. Only three people were admitted to hospital. Two of them died, a third was said to be doing well last night. 10.20am: Teacher Maryrose Kristopik who saved the lives of 15 children by hiding them in a closet while Lanza went on his rampage, leads them to safety .","Adam Lanza, 20, killed his mother at their home in Newtown, Connecticut .

The woman accused of gagging a whistleblower who was raising concerns about patient safety has been given one of the most powerful roles in the NHS. Dame Barbara Hakin has been made interim deputy chief executive of the new body in charge of the health service, second only to its head Sir David Nicholson. She is said to have helped authorise a payment of £500,000 to silence the chief executive of a hospital trust where 670 patients are feared to have died needlessly. Dame Barbara, a former GP, is also being investigated by the General Medical Council for allegedly quashing a report into high death rates at the trust, United Lincolnshire. The move comes amid mounting concern that senior NHS managers are not being brought to book for their failings. Her promotion was almost certainly overseen by Sir David, who is himself facing growing calls to resign over his role in the Mid Staffordshire scandal. Yesterday Gary Walker, the whistleblower allegedly gagged by Dame Barbara, said: ‘It shows a blatant disregard for public concerns. ‘It also shows the board has deep contempt for any investigations and processes that are under way. Calls to resign: Sir David Nicholson, Chief Executive of the English National Health Service is facing strong criticism himself over the Mid Staffordshire scandal . ‘She’s been under investigation for the General Medical Council for four months now for putting patients at risk. It also shows contempt for public concern over her action in gagging me.’ Mr Walker was chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals until 2010 when he was sacked after warning Dame Barbara that targets were being put ahead of patients. He was later given a £500,000 payoff on the condition he keep quiet about shocking standards at the hospital. Last month he broke his silence to claim that Dame Barbara, then head of the regional body supervising the hospital, had ordered him to prioritise targets. He also claimed he had warned Sir David about the hospital in 2009 but had been ignored. The GMC has yet to decide whether Dame . Barbara should face a disciplinary hearing. But next week she and Sir . David will come under renewed pressure when Mr Walker gives evidence . about his gagging order to MPs. He claims he has evidence showing the pair were involved in the contract to silence him which he will show to MPs on the health select committee. Last week when Sir David appeared before the same MPs he insisted he would ‘never sanction’ such gagging orders. Dame Barbara, 55, currently earns £70,000 a year as the national managing director on the NHS Commissioning Board, the new body in charge of GPs and hospitals. From next month she will take up the combined role as interim deputy chief executive as well as chief operating officer. As the promotion is only temporary, she will remain on the same salary.

Six babies died and 300,000 became ill after drinking formula milk found to have been laced with industrial chemicals to boost protein levels. Demand for foreign-made brands has since soared. Chinese mistrust of local manufacturers was heightened when last month a firm was found to be selling milk that was five years out of date. Danone said the restrictions should not cause huge problems for British customers as they tend to buy one tin at a time. There is also nothing to stop parents going to a second supermarket for two more tins. Formula: Security guards have been hired at some stores to check customers do not return later that day for another batch of milk for babies (file picture) But security guards have been hired at some stores to check customers do not return later that day for another batch  of milk. Parenting groups accused the manufacturer of scaremongering and said the restrictions would cause unnecessary anxiety for mothers. 'Even talk of shortages will worry British mums. Not being able to feed your baby hits at the most primeval fears of every mother. And if there are shortages of specific brands, this will cause problems as children get used to the taste of a formula and can be fussy if it is switched for another' Siobhan Freegard, founder of Netmums . Siobhan Freegard, founder of Netmums.com, said: ‘Even talk of shortages will worry British mums. Not being able to feed your baby hits at the most primeval fears of every mother. 'And if there are shortages of specific brands, this will cause problems as children get used to the taste of a formula and can be fussy if it is switched for another. ‘Baby milk firms get a lot of bad PR so this is an opportunity for them to be straight with consumers and let mums know what is going on. ‘Rising demand in China has been blamed for a whole range of shortages and price hikes from cotton clothing to petrol and diesel. 'While there is no doubt that huge demand could push up the price of milk powder, it is scaremongering to suggest the shelves of British supermarkets will be stripped bare of formula. Shipped to Shanghai: Many Chinese families do not believe their locally-made powdered milk is safe following a scandal in 2008 (file picture) ‘If demand in China is up as much as is being claimed, it’s an opportunity for formula firms to take on extra workers and create jobs in the UK and around the world to meet demand.’ In February it emerged that mothers were paying four times the price for Aptamil and Cow & Gate milk on eBay because shops had run out. At the time Danone blamed a ‘production delay’ and there was no mention of products being exported to China. 'We would like to apologise to parents for any inconvenience caused by this limit. We know that most parents only buy one pack at a time, so we hope that the impact of this limit on UK parents will be minimal' Danone spokesman . There are presently no plans to limit other popular brands such as SMA and HiPP. Danone does not know how long its restrictions will last. Earlier this year Australia and Hong Kong introduced restrictions after Chinese customers and tourists were found to be sending large quantities of formula milk back home. A spokesman for Danone said: ‘We understand that the increased demand is being fuelled by unofficial exports to China to satisfy the needs of parents who want Western brands for their babies. 'We would like to apologise to parents for any inconvenience caused by this limit. 'We know that most parents only buy one pack at a time, so we hope that the impact of this limit on UK parents will be minimal. ‘If parents are unable to find their baby’s usual brand of milk, we recommend they try another local store or revisit the store on another occasion.’","Parents can buy a maximum of two 900g tins of Aptamil or Cow & Gate .

An NHS worker who defrauded the taxpayer by claiming two salaries was caught after she boasted to colleagues about buying a ballgown for her daughter and a hot tub. Telephone operator Ann Barnes was today spared jail after a court heard she had agreed to pay back the £13,000 she was mistakenly paid thanks to a payroll error. Her manager became suspicious when the 47-year-old went from struggling financially to bragging about her wealth, including an extension she was having built on her house. Barnes was claiming £33,000 a year for 16.5 hours of work a week at the out-of-hours GP service, when she should have been paid £19,954. Manager Ann Poyner said Barnes seemed to go from 'rags to riches' - claiming she was once in such dire straits she thought she would lose her home, before her problems 'seemed to disappear'. 'I offered her a bank holiday shift, thinking she would need the money because of her previous financial problems,' Ms Poyner told Cardiff Crown Court. 'I was a bit shocked when she said she couldn't work the shift because she was going for a meal with her husband. 'She said she was then going to a garden centre to look at buying a hot tub. 'After 2009 she started talking about buying an expensive ballgown for her daughter's graduation, a holiday, and having an extension built on her house.' Barnes was subsequently arrested after Ms Poyner contacted payroll staff to check whether a mistake had been made. The court heard that the error started in 2009, when Barnes was given a promotion and pay rise which led to two sets of salary being paid into her account. A payroll manager spotted the double pay and queried it with Barnes, but she insisted she had two NHS jobs, and was able to carry on claiming the extra money for two years. Convicted: But Barnes escaped jail after agreeing to pay back the money she wrongfully claimed . Luxury: Barnes used her money to go shopping for an expensive hot tub (file photo) Barnes, of Crumlin in South Wales, admitted stealing £13,326 from the Aneurin Bevan Health Board between April 2009 and January 2011. Robert Hawkins, defending, said Barnes had paid back all the money she took using her husband's redundancy payment, and described her as 'a woman of previously good character'. Judge Stephen Hopkins said: 'You were clearly very highly thought of at work. 'Initially the double payment was an administrative error - but your vice was that you didn't correct it. The fact you will repay the outstanding sum is good but you cannot pay your way out of it. Barnes was given a five-month suspended jail sentence with 80 hours of unpaid work, and ordered to pay £1,600 investigation costs.","Ann Barnes, 47, paid £33,000 a year for part-time job as telephone operator .

"By . Michael Seamark . UPDATED: . 03:41 EST, 12 July 2011 . Close: Robert Peston, BBC Business Editor, is known to associate with senior News International man Will Lewis . At the height of the 2008 economic crisis Robert Peston became known as the man who moved markets. A new crisis, and again it seems to be Mr Peston, the BBC's business editor, who is making the running with another series of scoops, this time broadcasting or blogging a relentless succession of dramatic developments in the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. And once again, questions are emerging over quite who is providing the enthusiastic journalist with the 'inside track' that has placed him at the vanguard of the story. Media commentators have highlighted the close personal and formerly professional relationship between Mr Peston and Will Lewis, the very senior News International troubleshooter, amid suggestions that the BBC man is being used by the Murdoch machine. There are certainly links between Mr Peston, the son of Labour peer and economist Maurice Peston, and Mr Lewis. They are friends and neighbours living in North London and were former colleagues at the Financial Times. Mr Peston is also close to Simon Greenberg, News International's director of corporate affairs. A gossip column last week reported that Mr Peston was among the guests at a lavish garden party thrown by PR man Matthew Freud and his wife Elisabeth Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's daughter, at their Oxfordshire mansion at the beginning of July. According to the report Mr Peston, resplendent in a peach cotton scarf, was huddled together with Rebekah Brooks, his friend Mr Lewis, and their boss James Murdoch for a good part of the evening. Mr Lewis, former Daily Telegraph editor, was appointed group general manager at News International last summer and has been keen to portray himself as the new broom sweeping a clean path through the scandal-hit media empire. Pals: From left, senior News International executives Will Lewis, Rebekah Wade and James Murdoch all spent hours talking with Mr Peston at a recent party . Certainly, all the leaks have pointedly focused on the Murdoch regime of the past, particularly on former News of the World editor Andy Coulson who left the company some time ago. Equally usefully, the leaks have also sought to try to distance Mrs Brooks and James Murdoch – Mr Lewis's bosses – from the relentless tide of damning revelations. Who is feeding Mr Peston with a steady flow of exclusives remains to be seen and no one ever got to the bottom of the source of that 2008 exclusive. Back then, one of his morning radio reports for Radio 4's Today programme, breaking news of a private meeting between then Chancellor Alistair Darling and bank bosses, helped spark a tumultuous fall in UK bank shares. The BBC's exuberant business editor had already become known as the 'face of the credit crunch', claiming a string of exclusive stories, including news that Northern Rock was seeking emergency aid from the Bank of England – which was followed by the first run on a British bank in 140 years. Last night, Labour MP Tom Watson said it was 'not right' that Mr Peston appeared to be being 'spoonfed' internal News International documents that were being handed over to police.","'I was in tears': Gordon Brown reveals his agony after Rebekah Brooks told him The Sun had seen his sick four-month-old son's medical files .

James Bond is to unveil the brand new Range Rover Sport in New York next week, Mailonline can exclusively reveal. Skyfall star Daniel Craig is being ‘parachuted’ in to the USA  to  fly the flag and do his bit for British trade, having already helped  kick-start the Olympics in spectacular fashion  with the Queen last Summer. He is also to appear in a glitzy mini-movie specially shot with Craig in secret locations around Manhattan to showcase the Range Rover Sport and accompany its  unveiling at  a star-studded party on the eve of the New York Motor Show on Tuesday night. Photos were leaked this week of the new Land Rover Sport that will feature in a film with Daniel Craig . Daniel Craig, pictured in Skyfall, will reveal the car at the New York Motor Show on Tuesday . It is a major coup for the British car-maker which exports many of its vehicles to the USA and can now count on a home-grown Hollywood A-lister to sell even more. The new Range Rover Sport is the slightly smaller, lower-slung and sportier version of its ‘big brother’ Range Rover, and a big hit with celebrities and premiership footballers. Craig is already familiar with the bigger Range Rover after arriving in one at the Skyfall premier at the Royal Albert Hall. Land Rover bosses had sought to keep the car strictly under wraps for Mr Craig to reveal in the Big Apple next Tuesday night. The Sport is the slightly smaller, lower slung version of its big brother the standard Range Rover . The pictures were allegedly leaked by sources close to the firm who were prepping the car ahead of the show . But even Bond couldn’t stop the  top secret Range Rover Sport having its cover blown prematurely – nor his own role in its unveiling. Jaguar Land Rover hadn't reckoned on images of the undisguised car leaking out from an online forum, apparently from sources  close to the firm in the States commissioned to prep the car with special tints ahead of its starring role at the show. So proud were they of their work on the top secret car, that one of them even posed up with it, as the leaked photograph which hit the internet here shows. But even Land Rover itself has been dropping hints about the Bond connection. It said the Range Rover Sport unveiling to be broadcast  live to audiences around the world on Tuesday night  will feature the 4X4 ‘alongside an iconic British actor’ who is also  ‘a very special and very British Land Rover ambassador’. Long time fan of the brand Daniel Craig arrived for the premiere of Skyfall in London in a Range Rover . It said:’The all-new Range Rover Sport will be driven through the streets of Manhattan in a ground-breaking live event which will preview the new vehicle’s transformed on-road dynamics and unrivaled breadth of capability.’ A ‘unique film’ will form part of live reveal sequence, they add. A spokesman said: ‘Land Rover has also worked with a Hollywood director and production company to create a unique reveal – both to a live audience in New York and via a global online broadcast. ‘The dynamic, fast paced drive will feature the all-new Range Rover Sport – Land Rover's fastest, most responsive and agile vehicle ever – along with a very special and very British Land Rover ambassador. ‘It is fitting that the event takes place in New York City, as the New York metropolitan area is the largest Range Rover Sport market in the world.’ Land Rover global brand director John Edwards: said: ’The all-new Range Rover Sport is highly anticipated. The new Sport will not only be the most dynamic Land Rover to date but also the most technology packed and its new, all-aluminium lightweight architecture results in reduced CO2 and improved fuel economy.’ The New York International Auto Show will see Daniel Craig launch the new Range Rover Sport this week . Expect to pay around £55,000 and be shaken, if not stirred. In October last year Mailonline revealed exclusively how by stealth, and with all the low-key guile expected of a super-spy by Her Majesty's Secret Service, he effectively launched in Britain the brand new fourth generation Range Rover when he was chauffeured in it to the red carpet Skyfall premier  at London's Royal  Albert Hall. A Land Rover Defender also has a starring role  in the movie. Land Rover said of its New York unveiling: ‘The all-new Range Rover Sport will be revealed on the eve of the 2013 New York Auto Show at 19:30 EDT. ‘The event will be broadcast to audiences around the world via a special microsite.’ Guests must register on www.newrangeroversport.com to receive their ‘personal invitation’ to view the reveal ‘and be the first to receive news and information about 2013’s most exciting new vehicle.’ The car-maker said: ‘Those tuning into the live broadcast will be treated to ‘the best seats in the house’ and be able to select a range of camera angles and viewing points from which to watch the reveal.’ Join the conversation at facebook.com/LandRover or on Twitter via #NewRangeRoverSport .","Craig is to travel to the New York Motor Show for the unveil .

Three victims of what is believed to be the largest outbreak of hepatitis C in U.S. history have been awarded $24million (£15m) in compensation. A jury in Nevada found the state's largest health management organisation liable for damages after patients were infected during treatment at Las Vegas clinics. The outbreak became public in early 2008 when the Southern Nevada Health District in the city notified more than 50,000 patients to get tested for blood-borne . diseases including AIDS. Health investigators later traced . hepatitis C infections of nine people to procedures conducted in 2007 at . endoscopy clinics owned by doctor Dipak Desai.

A further 105 patients were found to have the disease, but they weren't conclusively linked to Desai's clinics. After the verdicts in the negligence lawsuit were read out, plaintiffs Bonnie Brunson, 70, sobbed as she clasped hands tightly with her . 72-year-old husband, Carl. A third victim, Helen Meyer, 76, whispered 'I'm in shock' to a friend at the end of the liability phase of what has been a . six-week civil trial in Clark County District Court. 'This country needs for people to know they can trust their health insurance company,' Mr Brunson said later. Accused: Health investigators traced hepatitis C infections of nine people to procedures conducted in 2007 at endoscopy clinics owned by doctor Dipak Desai (above) The Brunsons' attorney, Robert Eglet, . said he'll ask the jury of three men and five women today to hold Health . Plan of Nevada and Sierra Health Services responsible for another . $1billion in punitive damages for what he called 'reckless disregard' for patients' health and safety. 'This case is the example of what is wrong with health care in our country,' Eglet said after the jury was dismissed for the day. 'The insurance companies are making . hundreds of billions of dollars every year and yet the public is not . getting quality health care. 'And doctors aren't being fairly paid, so they have to take on too many patients to make a living.' Judge Timothy Williams asked them to reconvene for proceedings on the punitive damages question. Lead defense attorney, D Lee Roberts Jr., declined to comment. But . the two companies issued a statement promising an appeal and repeating . their lawyers' complaint that they were prevented from showing the jury . that company executives didn't know about allegations that Desai was . endangering patients with unsafe endoscopy practices at his outpatient . clinics in Las Vegas. 'We . are disappointed, but not surprised, by this verdict given the volumes . of essential evidence the jury was blocked from hearing during this . trial,' the statement said. 'We look forward to presenting our case on . appeal.' Since the civil lawsuit was filed, . Health Plan of Nevada and Sierra Health Services have become part of . United Heathcare, part of publicly traded UnitedHealth Group. Compensation: A Nevada jury found Health Plan of Nevada and Sierra Health Services (above) liable for damages after patients were infected during treatment at Las Vegas clinics . Roberts, . who argued that Desai was responsible for the hepatitis outbreak, not . the companies, is expected to ask the jury and the judge to limit any . damages to the Brunsons and Meyer. Meyer . and Bonnie Brunson were infected with hepatitis C during treatment at a . Desai clinic in 2005, according to evidence at trial. Hepatitis literally means the inflammation of the liver. It is usually caused by a virus, although alcohol excess can also be to blame. The most common types of liver inflammation and infection are Hepatitis A, B and C. Hepatitis C is a blood borne virus, which can be passed on through sexual contact, but is most commonly spread through the sharing of drug needles. There is no vaccine. It is known as 'the silent killer' because it often has no symptoms and goes undetected for decades. While most people recover from hepatitis A with no lasting liver damage, B and C can cause long-term liver disease, leading to cirrhosis and even liver cancer. In many cases there are no early warning symptoms until liver damage is advanced. Hepatitis A is spread by eating contaminated food or drinking water. It's most common in countries with poor hygiene standards. There is a vaccine. Hepatitis B is usually passed on by exposure to infected blood. In developing countries it is mostly passed from mother to baby. In developed countries it's spread through sex and sharing drug needles. It is 100 times more infectious than HIV, yet there is a vaccine to prevent infection. Source: The Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre . Carl . Brunson's claim for damages was for loss of consortium, which gives the . plaintiff the right to compensation for the deprivation of benefits of a . family relationship due to their injuries or impairment. During closing arguments, Eglet accused the companies of ignoring warnings before quitting a contract with a competent doctor to sign Desai to a low-bid contract. Eglet sought $20 million in compensatory damages for Bonnie Brunson and $5 million for Carl Brunson. Meyer's lawyer, Will Kemp, asked jurors to be 'fair and reasonable.' Bonnie Brunson was awarded $12 million, Carl Brunson $3 million and Meyer $9 million. One juror looked long at the Brunsons and Meyer as she was seated, and dabbed at her eyes with a tissue as the verdict was read. Desai, once a powerful member of the state Board of Medical Examiners, wasn't named in the civil lawsuit. He has denied wrongdoing, declared bankruptcy and surrendered his medical license, but faces trial in state court in April and federal court in May on separate criminal charges stemming from the outbreak. His lawyers have fought for years to prove that he is so incapacitated by strokes and other physical ailments that he is unfit for trial. State prosecutors accuse Desai of faking his medical conditions in an attempt to escape prosecution. Eglet and Kemp also won hundreds of millions of dollars in civil judgments in 2011 against pharmaceutical companies they blamed for supplying recklessly large vials of the powerful anesthetic propofol to Desai clinics. Jurors were told in that case that the large vials were unsafely reused from patient to patient. Desai and his clinics reached undisclosed settlements with plaintiffs before trial in those cases.","Patients infected during unsafe endoscopy practices at Las Vegas clinics .

Her words came on the same day that the judge conducting the case received a bullet in the post accompanied by a death threat. Jean-Michel Gentil has been subjected to numerous insults since deciding to prosecute the  58-year-old former French president. While Sarkozy faces up to the prospect of a trial, his 45-year-old pop singer wife is promoting a new album. In an interview with Le Parisien newspaper, she said a few words about Sarkozy, who is accused of taking millions from the frail l'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, 90. Testing times: Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy with his wife Carla Bruni, who described her pain at accusations that he took advantage of frail L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettancourt to secure political donations . 'He's calm and combative,' said Ms Bruni, who was said to be wiping away a tear as she spoke. 'We will do everything to ensure that the truth comes out. But I really can't talk about it. It's as painful to talk about it, as it is painful not to talk about it. It is painful for the family.' Referring to Ms Bettencourt's advanced years and poor mental state, Ms Bruni said : 'It is unthinkable to imagine that such a man could abuse the weakness of a woman who is the age of his mother.' On Monday, Sarkozy himself spoke about the charges, which could see him spending up to three years in prison. Last week he was placed under formal investigation for abusing the weakness of Mrs Bettencourt, who is the richest woman in the world. Allegations: Nicolas Sarkozy, left, is on corruption charges for taking advantage of elderly Liliane Bettencourt, who is the richest woman in the world, to bankroll his 2007 election campaign . In a highly emotional post on Facebook, Sarkozy said: 'At a time where I have to deal with an unfair and unfounded indictment, I want to thank from the bottom of my heart all those who wanted to show me their trust.' He said: 'I want to say that at no time in my public life, have I betrayed my duties,' adding that he wanted to devote all his energy to 'demonstrate my integrity and my honesty. The truth will prevail. I have no doubt.' The principal claim is that Sarkozy took advantage of the frail state of Mrs Bettencourt to persuade her to donate millions to his election campaign in 2007. Promoting her new album: Carla Bruni performing during the Echo music awards ceremony in Berlin this month . As well as prison, Sarkozy faces a fine of more than 300,000 pounds if he is found guilty of exploiting Mrs Bettencourt's weakened mental state. Interviews with Ms Bruni, who still uses her name in her professional career despite being Sarkozy's third wife, currently dominate the French media because her new album of songs comes out shortly. It is called 'Little French songs', and features references to a number of characters, including Sarkozy himself.

The giant cone-shaped cairn, which is made of basalt cobbles and boulders up to one metre long, has left archaeologists baffled as to its purpose and age. Heavier than most modern-day warships, the structure is nearly ten meters high and 70 metres wide. The structure, which is more than 200 meters below the surface of the water, is made from rocks stacked on top of each other . A 60,000 tonne stone structure has been discovered at the bottom of the Sea of Galilee in Israel . The Sea of Galilee is the largest freshwater lake in Israel - it is approximately 13 miles long and eight miles wide. It has a total area of 64 square miles and a depth of 141 feet at its deepest point. It is the lowest freshwater lake on Earth and it is fed partly by underground springs and partly by the Jordan River. It was first discovered in 2003 by researchers carrying out a sonar survey of the sea, but divers have now been down to investigate further and have published their findings in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology. They believe that the structure, which is more than 20 meters below the surface of the water, is made from rocks stacked on top of each other which could indicate that it was design to mark a grave. It is thought that it was made on land and then submerged as sea levels rose. However, there is also a theory that it could have been created below the water as a fish nursery -similar smaller structures have been discovered in the past which were built for that purpose. The researchers will now carry out underwater archaeological excavations in an attempt to find associated artefacts that could tell them more about it. Researcher Dr Yitzhak Paz, of the Israel Antiquities Authority and Ben-Gurion University, told LiveScience that it could date back more than 4,000 years making it an Early Bronze Age artefact. The giant cone-shaped cairn, which is made of basalt cobbles and boulders up to one meter long, has left archaeologists baffled as to its purpose and age (the map shows where it was found) He said: ‘The most logical possibility is that it belongs to the third millennium B.C., because there are other megalithic phenomena [from that time] that are found close by.’ If it does prove to be from this era, then it could be connected to the city Bet Yerah which was one of the biggest sites in the area at the time.

Many . of Jesus's sermons were preached on the shores of the lake at a time . when there was a string of villages around the water's edge. In the time of the Byzantine Empire the lake's significance in Jesus's life made it a major destination for Christian pilgrims. Its importance declined when the Byzantines lost control and the area came under the control of the Umayyad Caliphate. At this time all of the major cities in the area, other than Tiberias, were abandoned. In . 1187, Saladin defeated the armies of the Crusades at the Battle of . Hattin, largely because he was able to cut the Crusaders off from the . valuable fresh water of the Sea of Galilee . Dr Paz told LiveScience: ‘It's the most powerful and fortified town in this region and, as a matter of fact, in the whole of Israel.’ While details about the structure remain sketchy, the researchers are confident that it was created by a well-organised society and that it’s building was a community effort.

The Welsh actor, who turns 75 tomorrow, spent at least 90 minutes each morning being turned into the director – dubbed the Master of  Suspense by fans – with the aid of two make-up artists, £50,000 of prosthetics and a ‘fat suit’ to replicate Hitchcock’s 21-stone frame.

Award-winning makeup artist Howard Berger said: 'It was vitally important that Tony had to be convincing as Hitchcock' Award-winning make-up artist Howard Berger said of the £50 million film, which also stars Dame Helen Mirren as Hitchcock’s wife Alma: ‘It was vitally important that Tony had to be convincing as Hitchcock. We had what we called a “horseshoe” piece – a flesh-coloured prosthetic which added flesh to the nose, cheeks and chin. ‘It is a lengthy process because you glue the piece on and then you have to carefully “paint” on the flesh tones to make it match. We also had to bulk him up while still making him utterly believable.’ Despite the ordeal, Sir Anthony was ‘a delight’ to work with. ‘Tony was great because he would come  in every morning totally prepared,’ Mr Berger said. ‘He would shave his head and his face. The make-up would go on and his transformation would be complete. Comparison: Sir Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock, left, and the director himself, right . ‘His voice, tone and manner of walking would change. It was a sprinkle of magic. ‘Tony would not leave the trailer until he was 100 per cent. He didn’t want to walk on to the set and be Anthony Hopkins. ‘The greatest compliment that Tony paid to me was that he looked at his reflection on that first day  and said, “I don’t think I even need to act, this just does it for me.” ’ The film, due to be released in February, focuses on the British-born director’s strained marriage at the time of his 1960 hit Psycho.

Holidaymakers today staged a demonstration outside a French police station to protest against the arrest of a British ski instructor. Alex Casey was accused of providing lessons without a licence in the alpine resort of Megève, where he spent last night in custody. It is all part of an escalating ‘piste war’ which last month saw a British teenager claim she was assaulted by police clamping down on foreign instructors. Ski professionals from the UK believe the French are trying to drive them off the slopes – ruining peoples’ holidays in the process. Mr Casey, 40, who is originally from Folkestone in Kent, has worked as an instructor in Megève for more than a decade, but is now officially banned from doing so because he lacks a French qualification. He claims he was filming a group of British skiers on Tuesday when he was arrested by four gendarmes accompanied by government officials. Now he faces up to three months in prison for the offence of instructing without qualifications. ‘The police surrounded Alex and then escorted him away,’ said Pauline Foster, from Hull, one of around 100 protesters including parents with children massing at the Gendarmerie in Megève. ‘We were all deeply shocked to see Alex arrested, and decided to join the demonstration outside the police station. They should not be allowed to get away with this.’ Ms Foster, who is in Megève with a party of six family and friends, is staying in the Chalet d’Antoine, which is run by Englishman Simon Butler. Mr Butler, himself a highly experienced instructor, was arrested last year for illegal instructing and is currently appealing a three-month suspended sentence. Protest: Around 100 holidaymakers gathered today to demonstrate against the Briton's arrest . ‘I was led off the slopes in handcuffs – it’s pure persecution,’ said Mr Butler, 50. ‘If this kind of thing happened to French workers in Britain there would be an absolute outcry. It’s scandalous. ‘Alex is a hugely popular instructor, and that’s why so many people decided to protest about his arrest. Our initial aim is to get him freed.’ Lianne Purvis, an 18-year-old student at Chichester University in Sussex, lodged a criminal complaint in Megève after allegedly being assaulted by a gendarme on February 27. Mark Gibbs, her instructor, said he was ‘astonished’ when Ms Purvis was pushed over violently because she was taking photographs of him being questioned for illegal teaching. ‘The gendarme leapt on her, twisting her arm back,’ said Mr Gibbs. ‘She was screaming and crying with pain.’ France’s employment market is a notoriously protectionist one, with everything from hard-to-get training qualifications to strict social security rules used to keep foreign workers out. This has made it hugely difficult for UK instructors to get jobs in France, the second biggest ski holiday market in the world. The country expects instructors to have passed the ‘Eurotest’ – a qualification which requires completing a tough downhill slalom at racing speed. In January a decision by a court in Albertville to ban British ski hosts – those who simply accompany holidaymakers on the slopes – outraged the UK alpine sports industry. A spokesman for Megève police confirmed that Mr Casey had been arrested on suspicion of illegal instructing, and was being questioned while in custody.","Alex Casey, 40, from Kent, arrested at alpine resort for filming British skiers .

'When the door opened it went down quickly and we pulled him out just in time before his head went under. 'He was in shock and I guess his foot must have slipped on the accelerator.

Quintessentially British pottery designer Emma Bridgewater has revealed how in her darkest moments - following the horse-riding accident that left her mother severely brain-damaged aged 53 - she would go to the cinema alone and drink neat vodka to numb the pain. The mother-of-four, whose pretty polka-dot teapots and plates speckled with little pink hearts are stocked in middle class kitchens all over the country, says she used the fiction of film and theatre as an escape. Speaking in a new book by ad-man Charles Vallance titled The Branded Gentry: How A New Era of Entrepreneurs Made Their Names, Bridgewater - who founded her eponymous earthenware company based in Stoke-on-Trent in 1985, and in 2011 turned over £15m of profit -says: 'I've built a switch-off mechanism, otherwise I'm not sure I'd have survived. 'I can remember the horror of sleepless nights I've had. Sometimes, you have to sort of use an escape like fiction; theatre is very good; cinema is brilliant; cinema and alcohol are very, very effective. 'I can remember going to see Gosford Park, at a very hard time, sitting in the front row having had two large vodkas, feeling absolutely no pain at all.' Bridgewater, 51, who was one of eight siblings and now has Elizabeth, Kitty, Margaret and Michael with designer husband Matthew Rice, continues: 'I think a tragedy like this fires you up. I don't exactly understand why, but in some strange, probably quite simple way, what you're doing in your career, you're doing it for her. 'It's often unfocused and there can be anger, but there's a real longing to put it right - even though you can't really.' Bridgewater discusses the stress of having to put her mother into care while juggling two young children and a business, and how when she turned 40 she was on the verge of a breakdown. Emma Bridgewater began designing earthenware when she was looking for a birthday present for her mother but couldn't find any designs she liked . She says: 'Whatever it was, I was . exhausted. And I started finding the work pretty ghastly... And lonely. But then you think that it's very selfish on the other people who are . struggling for me to be failing on not one, but two counts: the business . isn't growing and I'm personally finding it exhausting as well. 'You feel there must be something . very badly wrong with you personally. You've got to be ready to admit . that things have to give. It's a little bit like making your house look . impeccable for a magazine, which I've always been very careful not to . do. 'You can make yourself extremely . miserable trying to do everything perfectly. No one is perfect, but . women get forced into thinking they have to be.' Emma Bridgewater at her pop-up Shop in the Fulham Road in London . Bridgewater developed rheumatoid arthritis which left her incapacitated, and was told she would only rid herself of it when she cut the stress out of her life, so Matthew began helping wit0 the company's administrative work. 'I think he'd seen how tough it had been for me,' she says. 'But it . turned out that he could do it just as well as me; better in fact. I'd . tripled the size of the business and then he more than doubled.' Explaining how her childhood influence her business, Bridgewater says: 'I think that the brand is very informal and I think that, luckily, I am as well. 'I think it's what my mum was. Mum's influence is very pervasive; strangely, probably more in the business than in my family life. 'I feel that I'm trying to capture the spirit of what she made my home life like as a child; what was unusual and special about it. And then turn that into a business. It’s a strange thing to want to do really, isn't it? 'Mum is still alive, so I can't mourn her because she's alive, but I want to explain her. I sort of feel that when we get this business right - in any aspect of the business - it's explaining her and what she stood for. And that feels very necessary - strangely.'

Matthew and I, you just couldn't find a couple who have less desire to . stay in fancy resorts or hotels or drive fast cars. For him, money means . land to do something beautiful with; to me, it's about trying to make . some lovely things happen here.

Live footage on NASA TV showed the Soyuz TMA-07M capsule slowly descending by parachute onto the steppes under clear skies. Russian search and rescue helicopters hovered over the landing site for a quick recovery effort. Rescue teams moved quickly to help the crew in their bulky spacesuits exit through the narrow hatch of the capsule.

The capsule touched down exactly as planned, and rescue crews were soon on site to help the astronauts emerge . The three astronauts smiled as they chatted with space agency officials and doctors who were checking their condition. Hadfield, who served as the space station's commander, gave a thumbs-up sign. They then made quick phone calls to family members and friends. NASA spokesman Josh Byerly said by telephone from the landing site that the three returning astronauts were doing very well.

He relinquished command of the space station on Sunday. 'It's just been an extremely fulfilling and amazing experience end to end,' Hadfield told Mission Control on Monday. 'From this Canadian to all the rest of them, I offer an enormous debt of thanks.' He was referring to all those in the Canadian Space Agency who helped make his flight possible. Hadfield bowed out of orbit by posting a music video on YouTube on Sunday - his own custom version of David Bowie's 'Space Oddity.' It's believed to be the first music video made in space, according to NASA. Superstar: Chris Hadfield has developed millions of adoring fans for the YouTube videos that he has posted in his five months as commander of the International Space Station .

Please scroll down for video . Dream date: Dwyane Wade surprised high school senior Nicole Muxo by turning up to be her date to prom . Appearance: The star posed for pictures with the high school senior and her friends . You can watch the full Youtube video here . Despite his knee injury and it being a rare night off the court, he decided to surprise her - turning up to the delight of the teen and her senior year. Writing about his night out on Twitter this morning, Wade wrote: 'I had a blast at Prom. Never be 2 scared to ask.' Ms Muxo, a senior at the South Florida school, is a huge fan of the Heat but particularly Wade. 'I was so surprised. I didn’t expect it at all,' Nicole told CBS Miami. The next day she took to Twitter again to thank the player adding: 'You made my dreams come true.' The 31-year-old father of two, whose on court nickname is Flash or D-Wade, called the high school student while she was in the dance at La Jolla Ballroom in Coral Gables - making her think he was just telling her to have a good night. But then he walked in, greeting her with a hug as she put her hand to her mouth. He said it was the persistence of the young lady, who tweeted him numerous times as well as posting the video, that won him over. Ms Muxo made the proposal film with her sister and best friend. Dance: The shooting guard stayed to dance with his date. He said he admired her persistence . Delighted: The 18-year-old was overawed by the star's appearance. He is her favorite basketball player . In it she poses in front of a Wade poster and says: 'Hi Dwyane Wade, my name is Nicole and my senior prom is coming up. I have everything set for a perfect night except for the perfect date, as you're my favorite basketball player I wondered...' The video then shows her posing with signs saying 'Will you go to prom with me?' This isn't the first time she's approached Wade, having asked him to go to her homecoming too. However, this time her use of the video and refusal to say no paid off. 'She continued to go for it no matter how many times I told her I’m going to be busy she continued asking if I’m going to come,' he told the broadcaster. Basketball fan: The Miami Heat fan wouldn't take no for an answer . Proposal: Ms Muxo asked the player through a Youtube video, pictured . He danced with the teenager and posed for pictures with her and her friends before making his exit. 'You wanted me to be your date, I appreciate it so much,' he told her. Thinking the star could well be a no-show, Ms Muxo had a back-up date in Laurent Chaumin but the fellow senior took the star's arrival well. And he was delighted at the fact that Wade complimented him on his suit. Wade joked he was 'the third wheel' and then left the teenagers to it. He has an ongoing knee problem which is being treated ahead of Wednesday's Eastern Conference finals.","Shooting guard surprised 18-year-old by turning up at her prom in Coral Gables last night .

Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group on the London Assembly, claimed Baroness Thatcher caused 'great harm' to London . Boris Johnson yesterday led calls for a statue of Baroness Thatcher to be erected in Parliament Square. The Major of London suggested a permanent memorial to Lady Thatcher should be placed alongside other prominent figures, including Winston Churchill. His comments came after Ken Livingstone said the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square – the previous forerunner for the site – was being reserved for the Queen. Mr Johnson said that ‘it is right that she should be properly commemorated’. He added that he has instructed City Hall officials to find ‘the right kind of place’ in the capital to erect a statue. He said: ‘People say put it on the fourth plinth – I think we’ve been around that a lot. Actually, there are better sites than that. I think we should look at Parliament Square. ‘There are other places in the heart of the capital that would do very well.’ But Labour today dismissed the idea of using the scene of poll tax riots as 'crass triumphalism', claiming Baroness Thatcher 'great harm to many people in London'. David Cameron today said he wanted to 'take some time' before any decisions are made on a permanent monument to the former Tory Premier who died on Monday aged 87. Mr Johnson's support of the idea of a statue has been publicly backed by former military personnel who served in the victorious Falklands campaign in 1982. The London Mayor has ordered staff to start looking for a suitable site in the captial. But Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group on the London Assembly, said: 'I don’t think it is appropriate to have a statue of Margaret Thatcher on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square. 'She was a significant figure, but she was a divisive figure. 'I would argue that Margaret Thatcher did great harm to many people in London, and to place a statue of her at the site of the Poll Tax riots, which symbolised just how divisive she was, would be crass triumphalism.' He went on: 'Boris needs to think carefully about this, rather than just jumping on a bandwagon. We all know he is trying to increase his standing within the Conservative Party, but abusing his position as Mayor of London for purely internal party political ends would demean him, the office of Mayor and our great city. 'This would also mean the fourth plinth would not be available for future artworks, which has been hugely successful and popular.' Supporters of Baroness Thatcher are calling for a permanent statue to be erected on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square . David Cameron said there would be 'lots of memorials' to Baroness Thatcher . Amid a growing clamour for a . statue to be placed in central London on public view, Mr Cameron confirmed there would be numerous tributes. He told Sky News: 'I think there will be lots of memorials. I think we should take some time and think about this to make sure we get it right.' Using the vacant plinth in the shadow of . Nelson's column in Trafalgar Square, at the opposite end of Whitehall . from the Houses of Parliament, has been backed by senior ministers. However, . there are concerns that any memorial could become the target of vandals . and protests, after police clashed with revellers at hate-filled street . parties ‘celebrating’ Baroness Thatcher’s death on Monday at the age of . 87. There is already a . statue of the former Tory leader in the member’s lobby outside the main . doors to the chamber of the House of Commons. London Mayor Boris Johnson (left) and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond have given their backing to the idea of a permanent memorial in central London . When the 7ft 6in statue was unveiled in 2007, Baroness Thatcher was the first living former Prime Minister to be honoured in such a way by the Commons . However, in 2002 a marble statue of the three-times election winner was decapitated after it went on show at London’’s Guidhall. Theatre producer Paul Kelleher was jailed for three months after attacking the £150,000 work of art. The court heard that when police arrived minutes after the vandalism, Kelleher said: ‘I think it looks better like that.’ Ministers backed the idea of a statue which could act as a long-lasting tribute to Baroness Thatcher. Mr Hammond said: ‘I think it would be very appropriate to have a memorial to Margaret Thatcher somewhere in London. ‘I haven’t personally given any thought yet to where that should be, but certainly the fourth plinth could be one of the options. Let’s look at that in slower time, I think these things are better thought about in slightly slower time after the event.’ Write caption here . David Cameron’s official spokesman yesterday said the Prime Minister thought it was a ‘good idea to think of ways of how in due course Lady Thatcher can be best commemorated’. The London Mayor’s office also revealed Mr Johnson’s office is now exploring options of a site for a statue. A spokesman for the GLA said: ‘The Mayor believes Baroness Thatcher deserves a prominent statue in a central London location and his team will assist with exploring suitable options.’ Lord Tebbit said that using the plinth in Trafalgar Square would enable Nelson to 'keep an eye on' Baroness Thatcher . The fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square has remained unfilled, but since 1998 has been used to showcase a rotating collection of artworks. Since Baroness Thatcher’s death from a stroke was announced on Monday, the plinth has become the focus of calls for a permanent statue. John Muxworthy, a Lt Commander on the SS Canberra during the Falklands War, said: ‘Let's have a full scale statue next to Nelson to recognise that she was at the heart of the nation. She was a great Briton, let's put her at the centre. Former Tory party chairman Lord Tebbit added: 'I think it would be appropriate for her to be honoured publicly in the centre of London. She could be in Trafalgar, where Nelson could keep an eye on her.' Tory MP Conor Burns, who visited Baroness Thatcher weekly, said the statue in the Commons already served to highlight her political impact. ‘I always say to young people when we go around Parliament, there are only two Prime Ministers of the twentieth century who are not wartime leaders who have statues in Members’ Lobby, they are Clement Attlee and Margaret Thatcher - arguably the only two Prime Ministers of the twentieth century to use their office to fundamentally try and change the country they governed, and I think that might inspire some young people.’","Boris Johnson and Philip Hammond lead calls for central London statue .

All smiles: Dancer Falah Hassan wowed judges and the audience with his cheerful routine - but today he revealed his heartbreak over the murder of his parents by Syrian government troops . As Britain's Got Talent star Falah Hassan wowed judges with his cheerful dance routine, little did they know his childhood was in fact one of heartbreak - after his parents were brutally murdered by government troops in Syria. Last night Falah, who has won a place in the next round, also told the Sunday Mirror how he was forced to flee his homeland and endured a dangerous journey hidden under a lorry to escape to Britain. Aged just 12 at the time, the tormented youth was quickly granted asylum. Speaking of his secret anguish, Falah, who is known by his stage name Poppin' Ron, broke down into tears as he described life under the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Fearing for his life every day, he said: 'I couldn’t just go out and play football, because you didn’t know when the government would start shooting people whenever they felt like it.' He revealed that he and brother Kovan would have died with their parents had they not been delayed getting home on that day in 2004 and says they were both 'saved by angels'. Falah recalled how his father would always try to help others, providing them with food or giving shoes to young children. But these acts of kindness towards his neighbours were frowned upon by the government. One day, he and his wife were taken outside and horrifically beaten to death. The soldiers then set the family home alight. When Falah and his brother returned home, they were tortured at the sight of their parents' bodies, before neighbours came along and hid them for three months. He said: 'My brother and I were saved by angels and I thank God every single day.' Falah eventually fled to neighbouring Turkey before embarking on a dangerous journey across Europe, hidden beneath a lorry. The journey took nine days and Falah only had a little water to sustain him. At Southampton, he threw himself off the lorry. People thought he had been hit by the vehicle because he was bleeding, but the young boy could not speak English and he only knew one word - 'police'. Apprehensive: The 22-year-old dancer appeared nervous before his performance on Britain's Got Talent . Thumbs up: Falah wowed all four judges, including Simon Cowell . Falah believed he would be deported, but was eventually allowed to settle in the UK. He was sent to a foster mother, Josephine Donovan, who enabled him to start a new life in Southampton. Two years later he was joined by his brother, who is now 20. With a talent for dancing, Falah became a teacher and decided to enter the ITV1 talent show as a tribute to his adopted mother and country. Paying tribute to her, he said: 'My foster mother saved my life and she is the most beautiful person on the planet.' He added: 'My heart is still broken, but Britain has given me the spirit to stay alive and continue fighting.' Master of moves: Falah, also known as Poppin' Ron, shows off his talent for dancing . Dancing king: Falah says he would love to help others achieve their dreams by setting up schools around the country . Defying gravity: The 22-year-old has mastered the most difficult of moves . The young talent revealed he has set his heart on helping others, like his father, and would like to open schools around the UK to help those less fortunate achieve their dreams. While he feels fortunate to live in Britain, Falah added he finds it hard to watch news reports about the violence in Syria and describes the place he once called home as 'destroyed'.","The 22-year-old, who wowed all the judges on last night's show, has revealed his heartbreak at discovering his parents' bodies .

"By . Elizabeth Sanderson . PUBLISHED: . 17:28 EST, 10 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:09 EST, 12 November 2012 . The grainy video footage reveals a woman frail yet unbowed. In a series of intimate scenes we see her in her dressing gown; moving with the aid of a walking frame; performing her daily exercises. We cannot see her face but the flaxen hair is instantly recognisable, certainly to the millions of Ukrainians who watched this footage first on YouTube and then on their television screens. For this is their former Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, in her cell in the Central Clinical Hospital No 5 in Kharkiv, known locally as the Ukrainian Siberia. Video grab from a Ukrainian TV station showing the jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko in her prison cell . At least six cameras record every minute of the opposition leader's day. Already a gross invasion of privacy, last month video captured by the cameras was uploaded on to the internet in a bid to humiliate her in the run-up to the country's parliamentary elections. Though in prison, she still forms the main opposition to the President, Victor Yanukoych. Last week, Tymoshenko's daughter Yevhenia, 32, travelled to Britain to meet with human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson to put together an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. She also came to plead for David Cameron's help, admitting that she wakes each morning terrified that this will be the day she learns her mother has died. Yevhenia is her mother's daughter, with the same blonde locks, penetrating brown eyes and determination. 'My mother is under 24-hour surveillance. It is like a mental torture. They're trying to break her morale, to get her to give in and say, “I'm out of politics.” ' Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko during a trial hearing at the Pecherskiy District Court in Kiev, in July last year . Tymoshenko, the heroine of Ukraine's Orange Revolution, was sentenced to seven years in prison in October 2011 for supposedly abusing her powers as Prime Minister when she forced through a 2009 gas deal with Russia. The charges are widely acknowledged to be politically motivated, a way of removing her from public life. But 51-year-old Yulia refused to go quietly. Still head of her Fatherland party, she denounces the president as a crook and a dictator. In jail, she has been refused treatment for a serious spinal condition, and was attacked by prison guards in May, provoking worldwide condemnation. It is for this reason that Yevhenia believes the authorities are trying to crush her mother. 'She's isolated from family, colleagues, friends: she's not given access to the phone. It's illegal to deny her phone calls but they do. All the time, in the cell, she has video cameras. She has done since her arrest, but the number of devices has increased exponentially.' Yevhenia says her mother has been denied every last vestige of privacy. 'We organised for her to have physio for her back. It meant she had to undress. The camera was over the bed. She asked if they would cover it during the treatment. They refused so she refused to have the treatment.' Yulia was first held in jail in Kiev, before being transferred to Kharkiv. Yevhenia says of the cameras in her mother's cell: 'Whenever she finds a spot where they can't see what she's doing, maybe where she can crouch down so she can't be seen, they put another one there.' Yulia's family and supporters learnt there were six cameras keeping watch on her at all times. 'We appealed to the court and the penitentiary said, “Yes we know about these six cameras but the other three we don't know who put them there.” ' The authorities deny putting the footage in the public domain, yet it has been used by her opponents to suggest that Yulia's medical condition is not as bad as she has suggested. Yevhenia is incensed by such doubts. 'This is outrageous. They're trying to say, “Look, here she is doing exercises, there is nothing drastic.” I tell you what is drastic. One guard showed her a hidden camera, above her shower. So they always see her, even in the shower, the toilet, everywhere.' Images of Yulia doing exercises have been used by her opponents to suggest her medical condition is not as bad as she has suggested . After the footage went on YouTube, all the TV channels in Ukraine, which are owned by oligarchs linked to the president, began broadcasting it. In another clip, Yulia bangs on a door. Yevhenia says the release of the video proved to be a mistake by her mother's enemies. She explains: 'She has the right to meet with her party colleagues every month. Before the elections it was very important but, when they arrived, the guards wouldn't let them in. So in protest she started banging. The people loved it, they said we see her spirit, she still has her strength and power to fight.' Yanukoych won the election amid allegations of flagrant vote-rigging. Yulia is determined to oppose the results, which were described by international observers as a 'backward step for democracy'. Many countries have spoken out against Yanukovych's regime, but Britain has been markedly silent. Yevhenia says: 'We're really trying to understand the position of the UK Government. Since her arrest my mother's political team have met so many people, so many prime ministers, presidents, from Spain, Greece, Italy, Germany, Sweden. They have all been so helpful. 'Maybe through this interview  I could appeal to Prime Minister  Cameron to meet Yanukovych or his foreign minister to talk about this. 'It would be a signal to the Ukrainian . government that we cannot accept this violation of human rights, these . election violations of everything democracy should stand for. 'We . would really appreciate it if the Prime Minister would give this case . attention and make his opinion public. That would really help us in our . fight.' The day after the . October 29 election, Yulia announced she was going on hunger strike and . has only had water since. Yevhenia says: 'I went to see her and asked . her to stop but she's determined. No one can talk her into giving up. At least six cameras record every minute of the opposition leader's day . After the footage went on YouTube, all the TV channels in Ukraine, which are owned by oligarchs linked to the president, began broadcasting it . 'For her it's the only thing she can do, to protest. She cannot talk, she cannot appeal, her voice is blocked. She said, “You understand if I don't do it, people who voted for me, the democratic opposition, will be disillusioned. By me doing this I am showing them I will fight to the end for their rights.” Sacrificing her freedom was one of the costs – really high costs – she paid for this.' But Yevhenia has paid too. Her father, Oleksandr Tymoshenko, had to leave Ukraine before he was arrested and was granted asylum in the Czech Republic. Educated at Rugby and the LSE, Yevhenia ran two restaurants in Ukraine but has rented them out so she can devote herself to the campaign. She never takes a break and can reel off articles of the Human Rights Act the way others might talk about books or films. Yevhenia Tymoshenko is appealin to David Cameron for help with her mother's plight . She travels the world, lobbying for her mother, but insists she will never go into politics. She's already lost too much to it. 'I try not to think deeply about this,' she says, her composure crumbling for a second. 'Because if I start then I will lose my hope, my power to go on. Our only dream is to have her back, for us to be left alone as a family. I want her to go back to being a mum, but she's always been, for as long as I can remember, fighting and choosing not easy roads.' Each day Yevhenia dreads it might be the day her mother dies. She says: 'Every morning I wake up with a feeling of horror. Until I – or somebody – goes to see her, that horror doesn't go away. 'At 12 o'clock, that's the earliest time we can see her. Until then, each morning, it's critical. She doesn't have any contact with us. 'If something was to happen to her, nobody would notify us, they would probably try to cover their tracks. 'That is why I'm appealing to David Cameron for help. 'Britain has stood for justice for centuries. We always aspire to their standards, especially on human rights. We need their help to release not only my mother but all political prisoners in Ukraine. Because their lives are in danger.'","Concerned daughter of former Ukrainian PM Yulia Tymoshenko is urging David Cameron to speak out about alleged human rights violations .

The Lumbia belt aims to remedy lumbago and, in particular, to prevent the need for surgery. Lumbago is thought to affect 80 per cent of people at some point in their life. Scroll down for video . A portable therapist? The Lumbia belt aims to train those suffering with back pain to sit up straight . The condition affects both young and old people. In many cases no cause can be found for . the pain, but age, arthritis, spinal damage and particularly poor . posture are usually to blame. According to Arthritis UK, lower back pain costs the UK £12 billion each year. Usually the discomfort is across the lower part of the back and sometimes radiates into the buttocks, the back of the thigh or to the groin. The pain is usually worse on movement and sometimes it is accompanied by sciatica (nerving tingling or numbness down one leg). Lumbago affects 80 per cent of people . Treatment typically involves painkillers and rest but in severe cases surgery to correct a spinal problem may be needed. In extreme cases bladder and bowel function can be affected with limbs becoming very weak. This is an emergency and usually means that spinal damage may be causing compression of the spinal cord and nerves. Early treatment is essential to prevent permanent damage. The new Lumbia uses a sensor to detect when a sufferer's posture is poor. In these cases, the belt vibrates to remind the patient that they must change posture.At the same time the sensor emits all the information it gathers to a computer so a therapist can help monitor the patient’s posture behaviour. By understanding when the patient tends to sit or stand poorly, relevant therapies and exercises can be prescribed. It is hoped the new technology will be on the market in 2014. ‘For perfect posture and to reduce back pain, interlink your fingers from each hand behind your back, just like Prince Charles does,’ advises physiotherapist Sammy Margo. ‘This will open up your chest and get your shoulders back and down, reversing the slumping posture many people have while sitting.’ And to prevent slumping, the mantra is BBC — bum in the back of the chair — she adds. Poor posture will throw the body out of its correct alignment, so certain muscles become overworked, while others, such as the stomach muscles, start to weaken through lack of use. This can cause undue stress and strain, especially on the lower back.","Lumbago or lower back pain affects 80% of people .

After a seven-year battle with anorexia and bulimia, starving herself some days and making herself sick up to three times on others, Kelly Sephton decided she'd had enough. But after deciding to regain control of her life, the 23-year-old from Chelmsford, Essex, was told by doctors that her road to recovery would be more difficult than anticipated. Kelly, now 31, was told that her behaviour had left her at serious risk of a heart attack and infertility. On top of which she was diagnosed with endometriosis, a painful gynecological condition which can cause infertility, and told that she could even be left bed-bound some days. Determining she would prove the doctors wrong, Kelly took up the most gruelling form of physical exercise she could think of: body building. Kelly Sephton during her struggle with eating disorders, left, and in 2012 competing in a Las Vegas body building competition, right . Speaking to MailOnline, Kelly said: 'All through my teens I suffered with eating disorders, switching between binging on food and making myself sick, to not eating much but strawberry lace sweets to keep me going for days at a time. 'My face would swell up from the binging, then go down and I would look skinny, then puff up again. 'I was always very active, going to dance classes every day of the week and playing sports, so the fluctuating in my weight was put down to my exercise levels and my eating disorder went undetected for years. My eating was what I feel I had control over - it was my little dark secret.' When she finally visited the doctor, Kelly admits his diagnosis that her life and fertility were at risk 'scared the life out of me'. 'I was told the extent that I had the endometriosis would leave me bed bound some days, and certainly unable to train. With regards to children, I was told to have a hysterectomy as there was no chance of me having any. 'I didn't feel anger or sadness, I was totally numb. Thankfully I ignored this advice.' Kelly had suffered a miscarriage during her eating disorder but didn't tell anyone, not even her partner . Kelly continued: 'During this stage in my life I was in a serious four-year relationship, and believing I would never be able to conceive left me feeling I wasn't a proper woman . 'I had already miscarried a baby at the beginning of our relationship but had been too ashamed to tell anyone, even my partner. I think about my unborn baby everyday of my life. 'I left my partner, feeling it was the best thing for everyone.' Kelly said: 'One of my aims is to educate people who . may be suffering in the same way about the positive effects proper . nutrition, training and an optimistic attitude can have' Kelly fell into a deep depression, slipping back into her old disordered eating patterns, until one day she leapt out of bed and decided to 'make something' of her life. She said: 'The mind is a powerful thing - and the magic of positive thinking should not be underestimated. So I decided I wanted to participate in bodybuilding competitions! 'This was the ultimate test of focus and hard training, and would ensure I gave my body the exact fuel it needed.' Kelly's old diet was a ramshackle mix of binging and starvation: . 'My old diet is difficult to determine because some days all I ate were a few strawberry lace sweets to curb my hunger. 'On other days I would buy huge amounts of crisps and chocolate and devouring them all throughout the day and then purging later. 'I didn't even like the taste of them.' Kelly now follows a strict, protein-rich eating plan: . Breakfast: Protein shake and oats . Snack: Chicken and fish with green apples . Lunch: Grilled fish or chicken with green beans and almonds . Pre-training: Protein shake . Post-training: Protein shake . Dinner: Grilled fish, turkey or chicken with green beans . Before bed: Tin of tuna, protein shake or raw egg whites . Kelly said: 'I was crowned number one . fitness model in Europe, and fifth the world! In the same month as Vegas . I married the man of my dreams in a beautiful beach wedding' In April 2012 Kelly won her first body building competition, eight years after deciding to cure herself of her eating problems, and was thrilled when LA Muscle And LA Tone decided to take her on as one of their sponsored athletes. She soon appeared in LA Muscle's brochures and website, and even presented on The Active Channel. She ended 2012 having competed six times, including once in Las Vegas in the largest all natural bodybuilding andfitness competition. Kelly said: 'I was crowned number one fitness model in Europe, and fifth the world! In the same month as Vegas I married the man of my dreams in a beautiful beach wedding, and I truly believe that one day we will be blessed with children. 'From my experiences I now devise online personalised food and training plans for individuals whatever their needs might be, and often take part in charity events for Endometriosis UK and B-eat, to help raise awareness of these organisations. 'One of my aims is to educate people who may be suffering in the same way about the positive effects proper nutrition, training and an optimistic attitude can have.'

The spurned wife of Great British Bake Off star Paul Hollywood returned to their family home yesterday, looking strained as rumours circulated about her husband’s relationship with his glamorous co-star. Dejected Alexandra Hollywood was pictured without her wedding ring as she returned to the 13th Century Kent mansion she shared with the baker, but declined to comment on the split. Meanwhile, her husband jetted back out to America to be reunited with his TV co-host Marcela Valladolid, who has been rumoured to be a factor in the collapse of his 15-year marriageIt was Alexandra’s first appearance since news of her marriage split was confirmed on Friday. Alexandra Hollywood arriving back home to marital home she shared with husband Paul before they split . Alexandra was spotted without (right) the wedding ring that she had previously worn (left) As she arrived at the marital house in the village of Wingham, near Canterbury, in a Mercedes 4x4, a male friend who accompanied her said: ‘She doesn’t want to talk, she is just going into her house.’ A neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘Alexandra is very upset and will not want to be talking to anyone about this. It’s all very sad.’ Mr Hollywood’s agent confirmed that the baker had left his wife and their 11-year-old son Josh in the family home and had moved into a rented studio flat nearby. Divorcee Ms Valladolid, 34, had been linked to the break-up after striking up a close relationship with the 47-year-old Wirral-born star as they filmed the US TV series, The American Baking Competition, on which they are both judges. A single mother-of-one, Ms Valladolid has described her co-star as a ‘handsome devil’ and the pair have exchanged numerous playful messages and photographs over Twitter. When Marcela was directly asked about her relationship with Hollywood yesterday, she smiled and shrugged, but declined to deny rumours of an affair.  She remained tight-lipped when questioned outside her brother Antonio’s £1.5 million mansion in Chula Vista, Southern California, speaking only to say: ‘Have a beautiful day.’ Alexandra at a film premiere with her husband last year wearing her wedding ring .

Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell became the latest cycling star to be hurt in a road crash yesterday. The hero of London 2012 was a ‘little shaken’ but her injuries were not serious, said her agent. ‘She is at home taking it easy,’ she added. Joanna, 24, who won team pursuit gold, was knocked down while road-race training in Manchester. She tweeted: ‘I am OK, no serious injuries just cuts and bruises.’ The rider, who suffers alopecia, added: ‘First time for everything. Been a cyclist for nearly 9 yrs & never been knocked off by a car until this morning. Bike came off worst. Take care out there people.’ Along with her Olympic team-mates, Rowsell has now switched her focus to road racing as part of a new women's race team. However, she is not competing with Trott and King in the current Energiewacht Tour in the Netherlands. Joanna’s crash follows a series of incidents involving Britain’s cycling heroes. Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins broke his ribs after being knocked down in Lancashire in November. The Olympic medalist collided with a van outside a petrol station during a training ride and was rushed to hospital. Less than 24 hours later, cycling head coach Shane Sutton suffered bleeding on the brain after an accident in Manchester.

Boisterous, mischievous and reluctant to heed their commanders, these young cadets hardly resemble a crack military unit. One chases rubber balls. Another plays tug-of-war with old rope. A third yelps excitedly. But next year they will be among an elite Army team sniffing out roadside bombs in Afghanistan. They are the latest eight recruits on the Ministry of Defence's new Young Military Working Dogs (YMWD) scheme - dubbed the 'Puppy Programme'. Scroll down for video . Brave: From left to right Lance Corporal Adele Wilkinson with Kiwi and Keith, Instructional Officer Mark Wiggins with Luther and Loki, Sgt Matt Jones with Joe and Jinx, and Private George Fort with Katana and Kevin . Give us a kiss: Private George Fort gets a kiss from Keith, the 13 week old Belgian Malinois puppy, after a training session . Puppy love: Lance Corporal Adele Wilkinson gives Keith a cuddle after the training session . The furry force will become highly-trained Army search dogs using their keen sense of smell to detect hidden Taliban IEDs, weapons and ammunition dumps in the dusty badlands of Helmand Province. The finest four-legged recruits join the Theatre Military Working Dogs Support Unit at Camp Bastion . Troops on patrol carry state-of-the-art electronic detection equipment. But old-fashioned sniffer dogs, each trained at a cost of £20,000, remain invaluable, saving the lives of countless servicemen. Major Steve Leavis, officer commanding the Army's Canine Training Squadron, said: 'Dogs have a proven track record. They can be quicker than technical solutions and don't go wrong. Give them food and sleep and you have a top-quality bomb disposal unit.' Playful: Private George Fort plays with 13 week old puppy Joe. Play and retrieve is one of the first lessons the dogs learn, so fetching a ball . Training: Lance Corporal Adele Wilkinson takes Kiwi through an agility exercise . Proud: Private George Fort with Joe, a Belgium Malinois who is on the puppy programme . But before deploying to war, the dogs must prove they can perform the vital task. The 'Puppy Programme' is run at the 110-year-old Defence Animal Centre (DAC), a 360acre facility surrounded by green fields in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. The Mail is the first newspaper to see the programme, started two years ago by the Royal Army Veterinary Corps. In the past, the MoD purchased older dogs - usually aged 15months. But military chiefs now believe it is more advantageous to buy pups at eight weeks' old. Katana runs forward during training at The Defence Animal Centre in Melton Mowbray . Duty: Sgt Matt Jones with Joe and Jinx, play during training . Learning the ropes: Lance Corporal Adele Wilkinson takes Kiwi, a 13-week-old Belgian Malinois puppy, through an agility exercise . 'They are blank canvasses,' said Maj Leavis. 'It's like building a high-performance racing car from scratch. 'We want dogs to jump on chairs, clamber on settees, climb over obstacles. That will be their job, to find what they are looking for. 'If they come to use having been told it is wrong, naughty or ""Get off"", we have to put in extra time and effort re-training them.' The latest litter-sized intake are Joe, Jinx, Katana, Keith, Kevin and Kiwi - all Belgian Malinois. The other two, Loki and Luther, are German Shepherds. Detection dogs are bought after stringent assessments. As well as medical checks, they take tough aptitude tests, including being startled by loud noises and 'find and fetch' games. Trainers look for boldness, character, agility, a desire to play and interact. Maj Leavis compares this to 'a school's 11-plus exam'. 'We look for robustness of body and mind,' he said. 'Are they investigative and curious? 'Throw a ball, and will the dog have the drive to fetch it? Or will it sit watching birds fly past? 'We want dogs for our most difficult task: detecting bombs. If they don't have the aptitude and concentration, they don't posses the right qualities.' To the dogs, the training programme, which lasts six months, is simply playing. Puppies: Keith and Kiwi take a break from training from the Young Military Working Dogs (YMWD) scheme . Old-fashioned sniffer dogs, each trained at a cost of £20,000, remain invaluable, saving the lives of countless servicemen . One game is hide-and-seek. A favourite toy is concealed and the dog must retrieve it. At first the object is stashed within a few feet. Then it will be several hundred yards away. Maj Leavis said: 'The puppy who searches for his toy shows an important trait of a bomb-sniffing dog. If he can't find his way out of a wet paper bag, no chance.' Later, pups learn to indicate or respond to odours. Once a dog sits by an object with a scent he has been taught, he has detected the 'bomb' and will be rewarded with a snack, toy or cuddle. Major Leavis said: 'We are trying to build-up their drive, their will to win. Finding the scent is winning the game. 'Eventually, the 'win' will be finding an IED and that will earn their reward. To the dogs it is playing.' Pups are encouraged to improve their dexterity by climbing over mini-obstacles, scampering through pipes, running up steps and delving nosily into dark corners. 'It's like having soft play areas for pre-school children,' said Maj Leavis. 'When they become soldiers, they will progress to assault courses.' Handlers also build up dogs' confidence so they are not spooked in unfamiliar surroundings. Walks among crowds of people on busy Melton Mowbray market days, rides along bumpy tracks in noisy vehicles or strolls near herds of cows help reinforce robustness. Later, they will be exposed to simulated explosions, gunshots and helicopters - the sounds heard regularly in Afghanistan.

Joe is at the start of his training, so his skills are limited . Maj Leavis said: 'They might have good noses for smelling explosives but can they continue to find them when scary things happen? 'We have to replicate as far as we can everything a dog will see and hear on operations. 'The last thing you want is for a dog to feel threatened on day one of a mission, to go to Afghanistan and suddenly discover it didn't like sand or someone shooting a gun.' Training is done by positive reinforcement. Find the hidden toy? The pooch gets rewarded. Undesirable behaviour is ignored and leads to a short period of 'time out'. At six months' old, the dogs are streamed into disciplines that suit their qualities - like school pupils choosing between maths, geography chemistry and English for their A-level. Some will specialise in protection - guarding defence facilities such as nuclear installations and Army garrisons. Others focus on detection. Sniffer dogs hunt drugs, smuggled currency, weapons and even poachers' trophies such as rhino horns and elephant tusks. But the ones who come top of the class get the priority task of hunting hidden explosives including roadside bombs. Maj Leavis said: 'As with soldiers, they won't all end up in the Special Forces. Some will be drivers, some will be engineers, but they're all important cogs in the machine.' At 15 months old, the dogs are ready to deploy. Currently, about a dozen 'puppy programme' graduates are in Afghanistan. Maj Leavis said: 'It's fantastic to know that what you are doing in your daily work is down the line helping to save the lives of soldiers on the ground.'","Eight puppies have become the latest recruits on the Ministry of Defence's new 'Puppy Programme'

Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has delivered some harsh criticisms to President Barack Obama over recent controversies surrounding his administration in a speech. Speaking to Virginia Republicans the Republican governor continued his push for punishments to be handed out to Internal Revenue Service officials that targeted conservative groups in the lead-up to the 2012 election. CNN says Jindal addressed the IRS’ extra scrutiny of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status, saying those involved in the targeting should 'go to jail'. Criticism: Louisana Governor Bobby Jindal is calling for jail time for members of the IRS involved in the targeting of conservative groups . Knowledge: The Obama administration knew about investigation into claims that the IRS was harassing tea party groups since June 2012 as the ousted head of the agency, Steven Miller , insists it was not illegal . 'Anyone who participated in this targeting of Americans for their political beliefs, anyone who knew about it, anyone who simply looked the other way, and anyone under whose watch this occurred needs to be fired,' Jindal said, noting that ordinary citizens who fail to pay taxes could face jail time. 'But in this instance, it is the IRS, people in a position of public trust, who have violated the Constitution of the United States of America. You cannot take the freedom of law-abiding Americans, whether you disagree with them or not, and keep your own freedom. When you do that, you go to jail,' Jindal iterated. Presidential aspirations:? Jindal has already visited New Hampshire this year and now he is in Virginia making some to wonder whether he has designs on the White House come 2016 . Fighting words: Mitt Romney has also been speaking out against the president, lambasting him for the Obama administration's handling of the IRS controversy . In a letter to the president on Tuesday, Jindal and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, chairmen of the Republican Governors Association, called for a special prosecutor to investigate the IRS. 'Anyone who believes that this White House, or this Justice Department run by Eric Holder, is willing or capable of investigating this scandal is unhinged from reality,' Jindal said. 'This president has grown the size, the scope, the debt, and the power of the federal government to such irresponsible proportions…that this is the inevitable result,' Jindal said of the IRS controversies. Jindal is among a handful of Republicans thought to have presidential aspirations in 2016. The various speaking engagements that he is undertaking include an event in New Hampshire last week are fueling speculation that he may be considering a run for the presidency. Former Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney said 'a special counsel should be appointed' to investigate the incident, putting some of the blame on Obama. 'The IRS reports to the Treasury Department, that reports to the president. The buck stops at the president's desk,' Romney said.

"By . Beth Stebner . PUBLISHED: . 15:38 EST, 20 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:57 EST, 20 April 2013 . A nation is questioning how intelligence agencies failed to stop the Tsarnaev brothers from allegedly launching a terrorist attack on Boston Marathon runners, even after they were outspoken on their extreme views on various social media platforms. Older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who was killed Thursday night in a shootout with police, was interviewed by the FBI in 2011 after a foreign government, later identified as Russia, alerted U.S. authorities that he could have possible ties to extremists and radical Islamists. The surviving ethnic Chechen brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is being treated at a hospital in Boston for critical injuries. A Twitter page identified by several news outlets to be his is full of cryptic messages like, ‘We try to find ways to kill time but time kills us.’ Brothers Tamerlan Tsarnaev, right, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, seen in a photo provided by the FBI on April 15 at the Boston Marathon, minutes before the bombs detonated . Dzhokhar's VK page, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, shows that it was seen as late as yesterday, when he was fleeing authorities . The Tsarnaevs, who have been named by the FBI as the two suspects for last Monday’s deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon, both had a fairly active social presence. Relatives said that Tamerlan was something of a ‘black sheep’ in the family and seemed to grow more radical and devout beginning around 2009. An avid boxer, he spent much of his time training in the gym. Despite working with other athletes, he said in 2010 that he had ‘a single American friend’ and didn’t ‘understand’ Americans. His YouTube page, which was created in August 2012, had playlists created on radical Islamism. Speaking with Reuters, a U.S. law enforcement source said that because the 2011 dealings with Tamerlan did not produce any ‘derogatory’ information, the matter was ‘put to bed.’ Certain statutes do not allow dead-end cases within the FBI to remain open, according to CBS News. The FBI, which first denied that it had spoken with Tamerlan, said yesterday in a statement: ‘In response to this 2011 request, the FBI checked U.S. government databases and other information to look for such things as derogatory telephone communications, possible use of online sites associated with the promotion of radical activity, associations with other persons of interest, travel history and plans, and education history. Friends told several media outlets that this Twitter feed was that of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; his last tweet was from April 17 . Dzhokhar, pictured bottom left, was part of an intermural soccer team at UMass, where he was studying marine biology . The two individuals believed to be responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings on Monday have been positively identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, now deceased, and Dzhokar Tsarnaev, now in custody. These individuals are brothers and residents of Massachusetts. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a legal permanent resident and Dzhokar Tsarnaev is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Charges have not yet been filed against Dzhokar Tsarnaev and he is presumed innocent. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, age 26, was previously designated as Suspect 1, wearing a black hat. Dzhokar A. Tsarnaev, age 19, was designated as Suspect 2, wearing a white hat. Both were born in Kyrgyzstan. Once the FBI learned the identities of the two brothers today, the FBI reviewed its records and determined that in early 2011, a foreign government asked the FBI for information about Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country’s region to join unspecified underground groups. In response to this 2011 request, the FBI checked U.S. government databases and other information to look for such things as derogatory telephone communications, possible use of online sites associated with the promotion of radical activity, associations with other persons of interest, travel history and plans, and education history. The FBI also interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and family members. The FBI did not find any terrorism activity, domestic or foreign, and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011. The FBI requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government. A YouTube channel belonging to Tamerlan Tsarnaev shows playlists and videos about Islam and terrorists . The title, which means, 'Ask a Muslim Woman,' shows a woman in traditional Islamic dress. The caption translates to, 'Do not trust polytheists' The YouTube channel also has playlists featuring Muslim extremist videos . ‘The FBI also interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and family members. The FBI did not find any terrorism activity, domestic or foreign, and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011. 'The FBI requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government.’ A spokesperson for the federal agency told MailOnline Saturday evening that the FBI is not releasing any further statements at this time. An Amazon Wish List, which was first unearthed by Slate, seems to belong to Tamerlan as well. Of the 23 items in the list, many are books on how to create fake driver’s licenses and IDs, as well as history books on conflicts in Chechnya. Among the titles are: ‘The Lone Wolf and the Bear: Three Centuries of Chechen Defiance of Russian Rule,’ ‘Organized Crime: An Inside Guide to the World’s Most Successful Industry,’ and ‘How to Win Friends & Influence People.’ It was also revealed that Tamerlan took a flight from New York to Russia in January 2012, and remained there for several months. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, left, was killed Thursday night; his brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, right, was captured Friday evening . In a 2009 interview, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, an avid boxer, said that he only had a single U.S. friend and didn't understand Americans . The FBI wanted poster released last night was updated to show that Dzhokhar was captured . An Amazon Wish List, believed to be that of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's, shows 23 items, including books on how to forge IDs, and history of political uprisings in Chechnya . Dzhokhar has a profile on VK, the Russian equivalent of Facebook. It says that he lives in Boston and lists his world view as ‘Islam.’ But as the Atlantic Wire notes, what people post as their beliefs on a site like Facebook or Twitter isn’t always indicative of one’s beliefs. Friends and classmates of the Tsarnaevs said they found few omens of radicalism in the brothers. Dzhokhar wrote on March 17: ‘See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil until the morning alarm goes off and all hell unleashes.’ His last tweet, written on April 17, reads: ‘I’m a stress free kind of guy.’ Dzhokhar’s tweets are an amalgamation of irreverent thoughts, blasé observations, and comments, from his thoughts on the TV show ‘Breaking Bad’ to re-tweets from ‘Condescending Willy Wonka.’ April 15: There are people that know the truth but stay silent & there are people that speak the truth but we don’t hear them cuz they’re the minority,’ he wrote at 11:34pm on April 15, hours after the bombing. He also tweeted last September that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job. ‘IDK (I don't know) why it’s hard for many of you to accept that,’ he writes. A tweet from March of last year reads: ‘A decade in America already, I want out.’ This comment was picked apart by other Twitter users following the bombings, with one person writing: ‘ProTip: Come here as a refugee, then blow up a public event…that’s a political statement. It’s terrorism.’ He writes on January 17, 2012: ‘some people are just misunderstood by the world thus the increase of suicide rates.’ In a detailed profile in the Boston Globe, Dzhokhar is described as the son who ‘thrived’ in America, coming to the country from Chechnya when he was either 10 or 11. A student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, he even won a scholarship and was pursuing a major in marine biology. Relatives across the globe speaking to reporters have expressed their grief that the brothers allegedly committed these acts of terrorism and seem baffled the two could do such a thing. Two separate explosions at the Boston Marathon struck as runners crossed the finish line on Monday, witnesses said, injuring up to 180 people and killing three .","FBI initially denied that they had spoke with bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, now deceased .

Doctors do not know what caused the condition, but said it could be genetic or it be related to stress after Alyssia's parents broke up last year . The condition usually develops in youngsters much older than Alyssia . Although JIA affects about one in every 1,000 children, it usually develops in youngsters much older than Alyssia. Doctors do not know what caused the condition, but said it could be genetic or it be related to stress after Alyssia's parents broke up last year. Ms Clayton said: 'I had to carry her from room to room and carry her into school - it was horrendous. 'She was that stiff that she was coming down the stairs on her bottom and she was in a lot of pain. 'Alyssia is quite tough and resilient, but it was frustrating for her because she is quite active and she wanted to be playing with her friends in the snow.' Ms Clayton, a beautician from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said everyone had rallied around and helped Alyssia, and she praised her daughter's school for their support. Staff at Ladybridge Primary School let Ms Clayton park next to the school office so she could carry Alyssia inside, and they organised a rota of staff and Year Six children to come and sit with the Year One pupil at break time. Teaching assistant Claire Acton and class teacher Gemma Bendelow even took it in turns to carry Alyssia in a class trip to Smithills Farm to make sure she did not miss out. Ms Acton said: 'She is a lovely little girl and we are so glad she isn't in pain any more.' Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic form of arthritis that affects children under 16. Idiopathic means that there is no known cause. In the UK, between 10,000 and 15,000 children are affected by juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The most common symptoms for all types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are swollen, painful and stiff joints that are usually worse in the morning. The joint areas may look red and feel hot to touch. The exact cause of juvenile idiopathic arthritis isn’t known, but it’s thought to be an autoimmune disorder - which means that the immune system attacks the body instead of defending the body against infection and other harmful substances.

Women live longer than men partly because their immune systems age more slowly, a new study has revealed. As their body defences weaken with the passing years, the increasing susceptibility of men to disease shortens their lives, it is claimed. Life expectancy in the UK is 79 years for men and 82 for women, according to the World Health Organisation. In Japan, where the research took place, the gap is wider. There, the average lifespan of men is the same as in the UK, but women live to 85.5. The study involved examining blood samples from healthy volunteers with a wide range of ages. Scientists tested the blood of 356 men and women aged between 20 and 90 and looked at levels of white blood cells and immune system signalling molecules called cytokines. In both sexes, the number of white blood cells per person decreased with age, but closer study revealed striking differences between men and women. The rate of decline of most T-cell and B-cell lymphocytes, two key elements of the immune system, was faster in men. Similarly, men showed a more rapid age-related decline in the two cytokines, IL-6 and IL-10. Two specific types of immune system cell that actively destroy foreign invaders, CD4 T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells, increased in number with age. In this case, the rate of increase was higher in women than in men. NK cells are believed to be one of the body's first lines of defence against cancer. The research, led by Professor Katsuiku Hirokawa, from Tokyo Medical and Dental University, appears in the online journal Immunity and Ageing. The scientists wrote: ‘Age-related changes in various immunological parameters differ between men and women. Our findings indicate that the slower rate of decline in these immunological parameters in women than in men is consistent with the fact that women live longer than do men.’ Immune system mechanisms not only protect the body from infection and cancer, but can cause disease when not properly regulated. In both sexes, the number of white blood cells per person decreased with age but the rate of decrease was quicker in men . Inflammation is a potentially damaging immune system response that contributes to heart and artery disease and could play a role in dementia. The cytokine IL-10 is an important regulator of inflammation, helping to put the brakes on the immune system to keep it under control. Its faster decline in men suggests that as men age they might more rapidly be affected by inflammatory conditions. Professor Hirokawa said: ‘The process of ageing is different for men and women for many reasons. Women have more oestrogen than men which seems to protect them from cardiovascular disease until menopause. Sex hormones also affect the immune system, especially certain types of lymphocytes. ‘Because people age at different rates, a person's immunological parameters could be used to provide an indication of their true biological age.’","Men are more susceptible to diseases that shorten their lives because their defences weaken quicker .

Price: From £39.99 / $69.00 (RRP) They have tackled the likes of Star Wars, Batman and Harry Potter, but now TT Games have tried their hand at The Lord of the Rings. And like the others that came before it, the result is a magnificent blend of authenticity with a delicate dusting of LEGO. The story follows the narratives from all three of The Lord of the Rings films, with TT focusing on the trilogy’s most memorable moments. One game to rule them all: This is by far the best LEGO game yet . Although fans may notice some omissions, particularly towards the end of the game, the overarching sense of one continuous quest runs true throughout LEGO Lord of the Rings. This is partly down to the audio and dialogue, which has been lifted directly from the movies. However, given this somewhat limited audio palette, astonishingly, TT still manage to bring a smile to your face – largely down to the cutscenes. Whether it’s watching Gandalf repeatedly bang his head on the lights in Bilbo Baggins’ house, or Frodo clumsily drop the ring in a mug filled with tea, they add a welcome comic element while respecting the source material. Gameplay follows the same structure as other LEGO games, although there is much more freedom. There are still an emphasis on plaforming elements, puzzle-solving and item gathering, but TT Games has created a world that encourages and rewards the player for exploration. The developers are rightly proud of the world they have created, too – the ample number of side-quests luring the player into every possible nook of the game’s map. Characters can carry up to eight items, but have a shared ‘Treasure Trove’ which houses an additional 84. Some can be found and others crafted from Mithril bricks amassed through your journey. Each character has a distinct ability – for example Legolas can use his bow to shoot targets, and Gimli can be thrown at larger foes. Although AI does a decent job in helping take down waves of enemies, this is a game best enjoyed with friends –  the drop-in co-op catering to those after a quick pick-up-and-play. Mind your step! Graphics look brilliant on console and PC - capturing the essence of the trilogy by cleverly blending LEGO with largely organic environments . The entire epic adventure is made all the more enjoyable by the wonderful graphics. Particularly impressive is the draw distance and the dynamic surroundings. Nothing is stuck on, so everywhere from the Misty Mountains to the far reaches of Middle-earth is available to explore. Instead of converting the environments into LEGO pieces, TT have opted to keep them largely organic – with LEGO making up the majority of the interactive items. Whether strolling through the leafy Shire, or battling orks in the Battle of Helm’s Deep, there’s a real sense of authenticity and scale. Sometimes, though, the more linear levels fall victim to the camera – making precise movement and jumping sections harder than they need to be. But this is a small gripe in what is otherwise a fantastic game – a fun-filled classic built for stardom.

When a beautiful young woman loses her breasts, the last thing you expect her to say is that she's delighted. But, believe me, I understand exactly why Angelina Jolie is overjoyed to have lost hers. I also completely understand why Brad Pitt claims it's a happy day for their family. Because I felt exactly the same when I became the first woman in Britain to have an elective mastectomy 20 years ago. Brave choices: Wendy Watson (left) with daughter Becky. Both have had double mastectomies to reduce the risk of breast cancer . The truth is that no woman would choose to lose both her breasts - particularly a woman as flawlessly beautiful as Angelina - without having the most compelling reason. But then, if you're like Angelina and know that you stand an 87 per cent chance of developing cancer in those very same breasts, your priorities change in a heartbeat. And I understand the trauma that lies behind her decision. Like Angelina, I saw my mother die of cancer. Like Angelina, I vowed I would do anything to stop my little girl losing her mother. And, like Angelina, I was just 37 when I elected to have a double mastectomy in April 1993. The terrifying truth is that one woman in 200 carries a faulty gene which  puts her at a high risk of developing breast cancer. However proud you are of your body, if you are faced with losing your life, your breasts suddenly stop seeming that important. And - as Angelina proves - a mastectomy doesn't stop you feeling feminine, looking beautiful or being loved by one of the sexiest men on the planet. Angelina Jolie bares all: The actress has revealed she has had an elective mastectomy . So while I suspect Angelina will be  taking time to come to terms with her new body, I believe she will never regret her decision. She may occasionally mourn the breasts she has lost. But her overwhelming feeling will be relief, because knowing you are carry a ticking timebomb in your body is almost unimaginably frightening. It's especially chilling when you know that you have every chance of passing it on to your own children. In my case, I haven't just experienced the surgery myself, I've watched my own daughter, Becky, endure the same operation. Becky was 23 when she was told she, too, carried the BRCA1 gene. Knowing the sense of relief it brought me, I encouraged her to have a double mastectomy. Now Becky, 31, is expecting a baby with her partner, Alex Menzies. Their child - they don't know the sex - is due in July. The whole family will be thrilled if she is a girl. But there will also be the unspoken knowledge that one day, unless there are massive strides in cancer prevention, she will probably face losing her breasts. But the fact that an A-list celebrity like Angelina Jolie is making that tough journey helps make it more acceptable. When I had my preventative mastectomy in the early Nineties, it seemed so extreme that even my closest friends thought I was totally mad. If I'd said I was planning to grow two heads, they wouldn't have been more stunned. And that made it all the harder. But my decision was born of the knowledge there was a scenario far worse than losing my breasts. I was nine when I watched my mother nurse my grandmother as she lay dying from breast cancer. I was 16 when I watched my mother, a teacher, die herself from the same disease. She was just 45. I had a bust that most women would be proud of (I was a 38C cup) but instead of pride, I felt loathing and fear. I was so paranoid I might find a lump that I even refused to check them. My fear deepened when Becky was born in October 1981. Would she be left motherless? I was convinced there had to be a genetic reason why so many women in my family were blighted by breast cancer but doctors dismissed the idea. 'The fact that an A-list celebrity like Angelina Jolie is making that tough journey helps make it more acceptable,' says Wendy . Everything changed in 1990. I had a chance meeting with a cousin, Jennifer Caudwell. My blood ran cold as she explained she had suffered two bouts of breast cancer in her early 30s. Her sister, Barbara Ayre, had died at the age of 38 and their mother, Lilian Holmes, had just developed breast cancer at 67. Sick with dread, I plotted a family tree. It showed that, over three generations, nine of the ten females contracted breast cancer. Six of them died. Often the gene had been passed through a male relative. When I showed my GP my bit of paper, he seemed as stunned as me and agreed to check my breasts every three months. Even so, I couldn't shake off the fear. I remember telling my sister, Diane, who later discovered she, thankfully, doesn't have the defective gene: 'I want to get rid of them right now.' I was only 37, but I felt I had a death sentence hanging over me. And then, to my great excitement, the Family History Clinic opened at the University Hospital of South Manchester's Nightingale Centre - not far from my home in Bakewell, Derbyshire - looking at genetic links in cancer. Because of my family history, I was referred to Tony Howell, professor of preventative oncology. When I suggested having my breasts removed, he didn't dismiss the idea out of hand. In fact - extreme as it seemed - he was incredibly supportive. So was my new husband, Chris, a policeman. We had married in 1990 after my first marriage, to Becky's dad, ended in 1986. And I knew that our love went so much deeper than whether I had breasts or not. It may sound strange, but the thought of losing them didn't worry me. I knew I wouldn't feel less feminine. Rather, just like Angelina I felt I was empowering myself, and that felt incredibly exciting. But friends were horrified. Their biggest concern seemed to be how Chris would cope, that he would drop me because I was no longer 'all woman'. They asked: 'Why not wait until you've got cancer?' How can you explain to someone who's never been there what it feels like to be stalked by fear every day of your life? I had the operation in Manchester. I can vividly remember coming round after the surgery, looking down at my flat chest under the bedclothes and crying, not because I was sad but because I was so relieved. The other women in the ward were recovering from surgery to stop their cancer spreading. Many had months of painful treatment ahead of them. All I had were a few scars and the knowledge that the danger had passed. I'd dodged the bullet. I felt incredibly lucky. I was offered reconstructive surgery six months later, but I turned it down. Although I am totally flat-chested, I don't mind a bit. At 58, it's who I am and I can't imagine life now with a full bust. I rarely even wear any prosthetics to give myself shape, and yet no one seems to notice. The Oscar-winning actress announced that she had a mastectomy in an op-ed she authored for Tuesday's New York Times under the headline, ""My Medical Choice."" I was so relaxed after the operation that I didn't try to hide my naked chest from Becky. And I know that my 'new look' never worried Chris at all. Things have changed since, however. Becky had a reconstruction at the same time as her operation. Indeed, Angelina says she is delighted with her own reconstruction which she had two months after her mastectomy. Her scars are so small, she says, she is happy for her children to see them. A year after my operation, the gene test for BRCA1 was pioneered. The blood test confirmed what I already suspected - I had the faulty gene. I had made the right decision. Becky Measures pictured with her mum, Wendy. Becky, 24, became the youngest woman in Britain to have an elective double mastectomy. I desperately hoped that Becky wasn't a carrier too. But it was a great comfort to know that, if the blood test proved positive, she, too, could elect to have a mastectomy. We agreed that it was best for her to wait until she was old enough to deal with the consequences of any bad news. In January 2004, when she was 22, she took the test. I held her hand as we sat in the consultant's room when she learned that, like me, she had an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer. Of course, we were upset. But Becky knew what she was going to do. She booked a double mastectomy for January 2006 - giving her plenty of time for counselling and to adjust to what lay ahead. I felt desperate I had passed this faulty gene on to her. But I was immensely proud of the way she coped: she refused to feel sorry for herself. Although they were so young, her friends were wonderfully supportive and three days before the operation threw a 'Saying Goodbye to Becky's Boobs Party'. When I saw Becky after her surgery and reconstruction, I burst into tears. The surgeon had built Becky new breasts, and they looked so lovely. Our shared experience has brought us even closer. As Angelina shows - losing your breasts isn't an end. For those of us who  carry BRCA1, it's the start of a wonderful new phase in our lives. Interview: Tessa Cunningham .

For the first time ever, sci-fi epic Defiance is boldly going where no game has gone before...and interconnecting a TV programme with an MMO shooter. Developed by Trion Worlds for the PC, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, the series takes place on Earth, which is war-ravaged and inhabited by humans and aliens. Gunning it:  You are able to select your species before kitting out customisable armour, weapons and abilities . It combines the intense action of a third-person shooter with the persistence, scale and customisation of an MMO, while its TV counterpart exudes the scope, story and character-driven drama of a classic sci-fi epic. Cleverly, because they exist in a single universe, the show (to be shown on Syfy) and the game influence each other – both evolving over time with actions in both mediums affecting the overarching narrative. Thankfully, the gameplay has a creative team behind the likes of RIFT, Everquest and Borderlands, working on it. The result is a wonderfully dark open world, capable of catering for thousands of other live players. Although MMO game are not renowned for state-of-the-art visuals, Defiance holds up well across all platforms - its impressive draw distance helping to emphasise the sheer scale of the planet and the monumental war that plagues it. There's also an impressive weather system in place. Often huge lightning storms can rip you and your vehicles to pieces, suddenly shifting priorities from death count to out-and-out survival. Target in sight: The game uses the perspective perhaps best known from the Gears of War series . As expected, you can customise your character. With each class comes different abilities, such as active camo for the Sharpshooter and speed boost for the Shock. You can pick to play as either a human or alien, modify your appearance and select and upgrade weapons. All weapons, vehicles and artistic direction have been developed in parallel with the series, and as a result, sound and look exactly the same across the mediums. Hit the road: The world is epic in scale so, thankfully, there are vehicles to make travelling a pleasure . Playing like a much more refined Brute Force with a dash of Halo, there is also a P-v-P mode, which can cater for battles of up to 32 players. Sadly, it will be next April when we find out if Defiance’s gamble pays off. But on this evidence, it looks like a sure bet.

More than half of Britons also admit not applying sunscreen frequently enough, and 60 per cent say it is too expensive, the Asda poll found. Nine per cent of Brits don't use sunscreen at all. In light of the findings the supermarket is calling on the government to drive down the price of sunscreen, which is classed as a 'luxury item' subject to VAT, rather than an essential health product. Almost two thirds of those surveyed said that the tax should be removed, and Asda plans to lobby the government to cut VAT on sunscreen.

Britain has leapfrogged Germany to take the number two spot in the world aid league table. As other countries scramble to slash their aid budgets, latest figures show we spent £9billion on overseas aid in 2012 – second only to the US, which spent £20.1billion. A year earlier, Germany was ahead of the UK in terms of aid but Britain overtook it as Berlin slashed its budget by almost £1billion in just one year, according to figures compiled by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Haiti flood victims carry sacks of grain sent from relief workers. Britain has leapfrogged Germany to take the number two spot in the world aid league table . Germany spends less on aid despite the fact it has a far larger population than the UK. There are 81.8million Germans compared to 63.2million Britons, meaning we spent £143 per person on aid in 2012 compared to just £106 per person in Germany. In addition, Britain’s GDP of £1.7trillion is far less than Germany’s of £2.4trillion. Our economy is on the brink of re-entering recession, with a triple-dip looming and many expecting output not to grow in the first three months of the year. Yet Germany is expected to grow its output throughout this year, with the OECD forecasting it will be at the forefront of a global economic recovery next to Japan and the US. In the first three months of the year, economists expect the Eurozone’s largest economy to increase by 0.6 per cent. In contrast, the UK will be lucky to see any growth. German inflation hit a two-year low of just 1.4 per cent in March, compared to the UK where inflation is running at 2.8 per cent. The OECD report shows that most member countries – 14 of them – have reduced the amount they spend on aid as a proportion of their national income as they struggle to deal with the global downturn. U.S. Army drops food over Haiti. Britain is second in the table behind America, which has 317million population . OECD chairman Erik Solheim praised the UKs for standing against the trend of cutting aid budgets. Angela Merkel's government cut foreign aid by £1billion in just one year . But Britain was one of just five countries which kept the amount it spent on aid stable over the two years – at 0.56 per cent of national income. This is set to rise to 0.7 per cent by next year, in line with a Tory manifesto promise. At the same time, other countries have slashed their combined aid budgets by £4billion – the largest fall since 1997. Many Conservative backbenchers are incensed the Coalition is planning to increase aid spending yet further at a time when public services are facing stringent cuts. Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘We keep being told that we need austerity and yet we can find money to pay for overseas aid. It makes no sense. ‘I despair when I think of the way politicians hand over billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to subsidise foreign governments, but cut back on local services. ‘This country has not had a budget surplus in 30 of the last 36 years. What makes us think we can afford this?’ The OECD expressed concern that most countries were slashing overseas aid – down by 4 per cent in the last year alone across the bloc. Plans to make Pakistan the biggest recipient of UK overseas aid are called into question in a hard-hitting report today. A cross-party group of MPs warn that taxpayers should not be made to foot the bill when wealthy Pakistanis refuse to pay taxes themselves. The International Development Select Committee says ‘corruption is rife’ in Pakistan and that the local elite ‘does not pay meaningful amounts of tax’. The Government has announced plans to end aid to India by 2015 but at the same time the amount going to its neighbour is set to soar from £267million now to £446million in 2014/15. The MPs demand that David Cameron pushes for action on corruption and tax evasion from Pakistan’s leaders and the International Monetary Fund. Erik Solheim, chairman of the OECD’s development assistance committee, singled out the UK for praise for standing against the trend. ‘Maintaining aid is not impossible even in today’s fiscal climate,’ he said. ‘The UK’s 2013/14 budget increases its aid to 0.7 per cent of national income, which gives hope we can reverse the falling trend.’ In terms of the percentage of national income spent on aid, Britain ranks sixth in the world, the same as last year. Ahead of us are Luxembourg, which spent 1 per cent of national income on aid, and Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands – all of which spent more than 0.7 per cent. The only other country whose aid budget approached Britain’s was Japan – £6.9billion. However, this was worth just 0.17 per cent of national income. Aid budgets across the OECD bloc fell for the second year in a row. Secretary general Jose Angel Gurria said: ‘It is worrying that budgetary duress in our member counties has led to a second successive fall in total aid.’ Oxfam’s head of development finance and public services, Emma Seery, said: ‘The UK government has shown it is possible to keep aid promises even in the toughest economic times. ‘Political will is crucial, especially as it is now clear that the eurozone crisis is having a devastating knock-on effect on some of the world’s poorest people.’","Britain is second on the world aid league table behind the U.S.

Experts estimate that one third of nine to 12-year-olds in the UK have a Facebook page despite rules that say only those aged 13 or over can sign up . Parents are responsible for the rise of young  children using Facebook, an executive from the website warned yesterday. Simon Milner, policy director for Facebook in the UK and Ireland, was joined by Sonia Livingstone, professor of social psychology of the London School of Economics, in warning that parents were flouting the site’s age restrictions by either helping their children create accounts or failing to be firm with them and stop them from signing up. As a result youngsters who use Facebook risk  being exposed to porn and online grooming. The site sets a minimum membership age of 13, however Mr Milner admits there is ‘no mechanism’ to stop youngsters lying about how old they are. Professor Livingstone said figures from two years ago show that 34 per cent of nine to 12-year-olds in the UK had a Facebook profile, adding it ‘can only have gone up since then’. She suggested the starting age was reaching school years five to six, or children aged ten to 11. Speaking at the Oxford Media Convention, Professor Livingstone, who researches children and internet use, urged parents to be stricter, saying: ‘If parents say “no, you’re too young”, young children will listen to that…Parents should say no.’ Blocked: Users must vouch that they are 13 or older to sign up for the website but many children simply lie about their age . Mr Milner, who was at the same event, . said: ‘I am well aware of research which shows there are a lot of 11, . 12, or even younger children who have Facebook accounts and lie about . their age. 'The research also shows that, in the great majority, parents . not only know about this but actually help their children do this. Just . to be clear, we don’t condone it.’ He admitted preventing under-age . children from signing on was a ‘tricky’ area: ‘We haven’t got a . mechanism for eradicating the problem.’ Spot checks and a reporting system are in place in an attempt to protect youngsters, he said. He told the Oxford Media Convention it cannot make every user prove their age . as it 'would get privacy advocates up in arms'. However, he said the company neither 'condones' nor 'condemns' parents but says it is their decision. Facebook rules state that anybody under . 13 cannot use the website but there is nothing stopping a young child . from lying when asked to enter their date of birth. Mr Milner told the event: 'You can't make everyone prove their age … that would get privacy advocates up in arms.' He added that the under-13s rule was in place not because Facebook is 'unsafe' but because of a US children's online privacy law. The site does have strict rules about . bullying and grooming and Mr Milner said policing Facebook would not be . given to an external company.","Facebook rules prevent children under 13 from signing up .

"By . Louise Eccles . UPDATED: . 21:04 EST, 9 November 2011 . In her heyday she helped destroy a German battleship, supported the D-Day landings and survived a blast from an enemy mine. But HMS Belfast sank without trace this week when she was airbrushed out of official London Olympic posters because she ‘got in the way’. Veterans expressed their disgust at the step yesterday, saying it insulted the memory of those who died in the war in the run-up to Remembrance Sunday and reflected embarrassment at our military past. Airbrushed from history: The poster at Camden Town tube station which has been doctored to remove HMS Belfast from the River Thames . The real thing: HMS Belfast can clearly be seen down river from Tower Bridge in this image . The Mail understands designers removed Britain’s largest historic vessel from an aerial photograph of London because it ‘obscured’ the white lettering on one of seven posters. But HMS Belfast was then deleted – accidentally, it is claimed – from all of them. It is thought as many as 200 of the posters were put up around London, including on the Tube, before being hastily removed. Falklands veteran Commander John Muxworthy said: ‘It is barking. The Navy helped develop the British Empire and HMS Belfast has contributed to that greatness. It cannot just be airbrushed out.’ Martyn Heighton, director of National Historic Ships, which advises the government on the preservation of such vessels, said: ‘It is unbelievable. HMS Belfast does not get in the way of anything, certainly not the design of a poster. Graphics should be worked around her.’ The posters were to promote the London 2012 Festival, which runs alongside the Olympic and Paralympic Games and will, ironically, celebrate Britain’s cultural heritage. The Olympic organisers Locog apologised last night but insisted  it was a ‘simple mistake in the advertising production process’. But Colonel Richard Kemp, former Commander of British Forces in Afghanistan and founder of the  UK National Defence Association, said: ‘You do not do that kind of thing by accident. ‘At best, this is very bad judgment, at worst, a deliberate decision to remove it because of some sense of embarrassment about Britain’s military history.’ Missing: The selection of posters were spotted at Camden Town Underground station just days before Remembrance Sunday . Popular: HMS Belfast attracts around 250,000 visitors a year who can its explore her nine decks . Proud history: HMS Belfast flies the Union Jack as it sails in Hong Kong in 1950 . Sir James Eberle, a former Supreme . Commander of Nato and Commander-in-chief of the British fleet who served . on HMS Belfast, said: ‘This shows complete contempt for veterans, . especially just days from Remembrance Sunday. ‘It is part of a worrying trend of trying to completely remove wars and fighting from our history.’ Fred Wooding, of the HMS Belfast Association, who also served on the ship, said the apparent removal of the ship was an ‘insult to the people who served their country’. He added: ‘Without HMS Belfast there wouldn’t be an Olympic Games in London. They would be in Berlin. Coming just days before Remembrance Sunday, it is particularly dreadful.’ HMS Belfast was launched in 1938 and played a vital role in the Second World War, taking part in the sinking of the battleship Scharnhorst in 1943 and supporting the Normandy landings. She also saw service in the Korean War. She was retired in 1963 and has been moored on the Thames as a visitor attraction since 1971. Outraged: Sir James Eberle, a former gunnery officer on HMS Belfast who then went on to become Commander-in-chief of the British fleet . Work . on HMS Belfast began in 1936 amid fears over the growing military . strength of Nazi Germany and she was launched in March 1938. Just . over a year later she struck a Nazi mine in November 1939 and spent the . next three years undergoing repairs. However when she was relaunched in . November 1942 the cruiser had been built up to be the Navy's strongest . warship. The following years she cemented her reputation as one the most feared ships in the conflict. She . obliterated the German warship Scharnhorst in the  Battle of North Cape . in 1943 and played a key role in the Normandy landings blasting the . defences of the German army's famed 'Atlantic Wall'. After . the war in Europe ended, Belfast was sent to join the British Pacific . Fleet in the Far East where Japan still posed a threat. She saw action . again between 1950 and 1952 in the Korean War. She . was entered into reserve in 1963 and following a campaign to avoid her . being scrapped by the Government a trust was created and private funds . ensured she was preserved as museum in 1971. The . ship was moored on the Thames and opened to the public in 1978. The . vessel is the last remaining major warship from the two world wars. Sir .

"By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 08:14 EST, 24 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:53 EST, 25 April 2013 . Enrico Letta looks set to become the new Italian Prime Minister after being asked to form a government by president Giorgio Napolitano. The 46-year-old nephew of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's long-time chief of staff Gianni Letta, would be the youngest Italian Prime Minister in 25 years. The formation of a government would bring an end to two months of political impasse in Italy after an inconclusive election back in February. The new government, which could take . office in a matter of days, would be backed primarily by the rival . centre-left and centre-right groupings, which had refused to cut a deal . in the wake of the election. Leader in waiting: Giorgio Napolitano, left, has called on Enrico Letta, right, to form a government in Italy . Letta, deputy leader of the Democratic Party (PD), is considered a moderate and is close to former party leader Pier Luigi Bersani, who resigned at the weekend after rebels sabotaged him in the voting for a new president, which ended with Napolitano being re-elected. Letta said yesterday that his party would back any government committed to tackling the 'social-economic emergency' and enacting serious political reform, including changes to a dysfunctional electoral law considered largely responsible for the two-month long political stalemate. In February's general election, the centre-left narrowly won a majority in the lower house but failed to win control of the Senate and was not able to form a government. Hopes that the deadlock would soon be over have given a further boost to financial markets, with the yield on 10-year Italian government bonds dropping below four percent and the spread, or risk premium, over German bonds narrowing. Breakthrough: Enrico Letta talks to the press after meeting with President Napolitano where he was asked to form a government and end the country's political deadlock . Italy's economy has been the most sluggish in Europe for more than a decade and mired in a deep recession since the middle of 2011, with no recovery in sight. Former Prime Minister Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PDL) party, Letta's PD and the centrist Civic Choice movement of outgoing premier Mario Monti have all said they will cooperate with whomever Napolitano chooses. Outgoing: Former Prime Minister Mario Monti has said that he would co-operate with whoever the President picked as his replacement . Mr Berlusconi said after meeting Napolitano: 'Given the crisis the country finds itself in, the country needs a strong, a durable government that can make important decisions.' Napolitano hit out at Italy's political parties on Monday when he was inaugurated for an unprecedented second term, berating them for their 'irresponsibility' in prolonging the political stalemate for nearly two months. He threatened to resign unless the parties agreed to cooperate and find some middle ground on reforms. Letta's party has been most hurt by the political impasse and the stability of the next government could be threatened given the hostility among many in the party to any deal with Berlusconi, their enemy for almost two decades. Deep internal divisions worsened when former PD leader Mr Bersani was unable to make a government deal with either Berlusconi's centre-right or the shock new third political force, Beppe Grillo's 5-Star Movement. And Mr Berlusconi has capitalised on the centre-left's woes. One poll gave the centre-right a clear lead of around eight points. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which won a quarter of the vote and speaks for millions of Italians disillusioned with an entire political class, told Mr Napolitano it would sit in opposition and may support specific reforms. The Left Ecology Freedom party (SEL), a partner of the PD in the February election, and Berlusconi's allies in the Northern League also said they would not join a coalition led by Mr Amato. All smiles: Silvio Berlusconi has capitalised on the damage the political impasses has caused to the centre-left with one opinion poll showing the centre right eight points ahead .","Democratic Party deputy leader Enrico Letta asked to form government .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:46 EST, 17 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:59 EST, 17 May 2013 . Labour MP John Healey unearthed the costs of calling government departments . Millions of people are being ripped off by government premium rate phone lines, it was claimed today. The Department for Transport alone raised £2.5million over two years from calls branded a ‘telephone tax’. Labour MP John Healey warned many of the premium-rate numbers were imposed on the ‘sick, elderly and vulnerable usually on fixed, low incomes’. Almost two thirds of the government’s 371 lines called by the public are high cost 0844 and 0845 numbers or premium (09) numbers. The numbers cost up to 41p per minute to call. Mr Healey has compiled a dossier of the huge costs charged by ministries to discuss benefits, travel queries and business advice. The National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee should now investigate the use of the numbers and the impact on the public, Mr Healey said. ‘We make millions of calls every year to government departments and agencies,’ he added. ‘People have no choice but to make these calls – to get information and help, change details, make claims – but they are being charged rip-off rates to do so. ‘Members of the public are subsidising the government’s phone bills to the tune of millions of pounds and phone companies are making a fortune. ‘Living costs are high enough already without the government hiking up phone bills through this telephone tax.’ The Department for Transport raised £2.5million revenue from 2010 to 2013, for lines operated by the DVLA for motor trade businesses. The Department for Transport raised £2.5million from high cost phonelines in two years . The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pocketed £ 10,000 in revenue from lines operated by the Rural Payments Agency. Other departments receive benefits in kind from phone companies. For example, HM Revenue and Customs receives £4.7million worth of free additional services from Cable & Wireless. The Department for Work and Pensions, which has 139 high cost lines, has had the cost of outbound calls reduced by BT. Helplines for the government’s new benefits – Personal Independence Payment and Universal Credit – will also be 0845 numbers. Mr Healey compiled details of 16 government departments and their agencies through parliamentary questions. He found that 61% were high cost and 39% free or geographic rate. The Home Office has 23 phone lines of which 22 are high cost, while 139 of 172 lines at DWP charge extra to call. Other departments also use high costs lines including Defra which has 24, Department for Business which has 19 and Transport eight. A DWP spokesman said: 'DWP does not earn any revenue from 0845 numbers. All claimants who need to use an 0845 number can do so for free from their local Jobcentre or can request a call back from an adviser.'","Department for Transport rakes in £2.5million in just two years .

When Angelina Jolie revealed that she had had a double mastectomy to lessen her chances of developing the cancer that killed her mother, she was praised across the world for her courage. But in some corners of the internet, her announcement was greeted only with cruelty. Trolls branded her a ‘drama queen’  and an ‘attention seeker’, with some  suggesting her decision was a publicity stunt and others making crude jokes about her breasts. Miss Jolie, 37, revealed she had had the surgery in an article for the New York Times, explaining she was making her decision public in the hope it would raise awareness and help other women. Angelina Jolie, left, went public with her decision to have a preventative double mastectomy, and was lambasted for doing so by Huffington Post columnist Brendan O'Neill, right . Her mother died of cancer at 56, and . Miss Jolie said she had had her breasts removed to reassure her six . children that the same wouldn’t happen to her. Tests revealed she had a faulty gene . which gave her an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer. Having . a mastectomy has reduced that to 5 per cent. She underwent three months of treatment, which ended with reconstructive surgery last month. While campaigners and charities praised her decision to go public, Twitter users soon began making vile jokes. One asked: ‘Can you buy Angelina Jolie’s boobs on eBay?’ Angelina with four of her six children, Maddox, Zahara, Pax and Shilioh .

He said: ‘The praise being heaped on .

More than eight million families admit their personal debts are ‘a burden’ as the country’s total debt mountain balloons to nearly £100billion, official figures revealed yesterday. The report, from the Office for National Statistics, highlights how debt problems have jumped sharply since the recession struck in 2008. To make matters worse, it ignores people’s mortgages, and looks only at other types of debt such as an unpaid credit card bill, an overdraft and a personal loan. Telling: How people feel about their debt has become more serious and stressed since the recession with eight millions families feeling it is a burden . An extra 420,000 families describe their debts as either a ‘heavy’ burden or ‘somewhat of a burden’, compared to 2006 when the same question was asked. Overall, one in two families who have debts find them a struggle, with a large chunk of their take-home pay wiped out by paying their debts every month. For those who cannot afford to pay off their debts, the situation gets worse and worse as the interest bill on their debts escalates rapidly. Of the 16.3million households who have debts, it says the average debt is £3,200, compared to £2,800 before the recession struck. This is the equivalent of two month’s take-home pay for a typical worker with a full-time job earning the country’s average salary of £26,000. Stress: The average household has £400 more debt on items like credit cards than before the 2008 recession . The ONS said the total debt - excluding mortgages - of households in Britain is £94.7billion, compared to £85.9billion before the recession began. The situation is most acute for people between the age of 25 and 34, an age at which the average debt burden peaks at £4,300. For pensioners, the average is just £1,100. This is because many people are having their first child at this age, an event which pushes many into debt with a long list of extra costs from a pram to a larger home. To add to the pressure, many couple’s see their earnings drop as one parent gives up work, to switch to a part-time job or they both continue to work but spend a fortune on childcare. Dr Howard Archer, UK economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: ‘Increased debt levels have been a major factor weighing down on consumer confidence.’ He said it has curbed people’s ‘willingness and ability to spend’ with a growing list of casualties on the high-street from Jessops to HMV going into administration. Picture: Says its latest survey has these findings, with the debt mountain in the UK approaching £100bn . Pressure: The ONS says it is the poorest households that feel the intense burden of debt far more than the richest . Worst off: Lone parents with children have higher financial liabilities but lower average debt than a married couple with no children . Delroy Corinaldi, a director of the StepChange Debt Charity, said: ‘Stagnating wages and rising living costs continue to push household budgets beyond breaking point. ‘The financial torture facing many households shows little sign of abating.’ For millions of workers, they did not lose their job during the recession but they have been hammered by the toxic combination of paltry pay rises or pay freezes and rising bills. A recent poll by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the recession had ‘a profound impact’ on workplaces from offices to factories. Around 22,000 workers were quizzed about their life at work, how they are treated and how it has changed since 2008, the year that the downturn began. More than one in four private sector workers have been hit by at least one annual pay cut or pay freeze, rising to 48 per cent in the public sector.","Pressure of debt has got worse since the 2008 recession, ONS survey finds .

Punishment: Whitehall¿s Forfeiture Committee has already stripped former RBS boss Fred Goodwin of his knighthood . Bankers who were in charge during the financial crash are set to be stripped of their knighthoods and other honours this year. Senior Whitehall sources have told the Mail that mandarins will have no choice but to recommend that the Queen removes gongs from the guilty men if they were handed out for services to banking. In a stark warning to City fatcats who have so far escaped censure, a source has confirmed that Whitehall’s Forfeiture Committee will meet later this year to consider which bankers should be punished for their role in sending the economy into freefall. The source said that it will ‘be practically impossible’ for the committee not to recommend that their honours are removed. The Mail has learned that it will meet ‘fairly soon’ formally to remove the knighthood from former HBOS chief executive Sir James Crosby, whose catastrophic mismanagement of the company helped lead to the taxpayer having to bail it out. The committee last year stripped former RBS boss Fred Goodwin of his knighthood. But while Sir James has requested that his honour be removed – and agreed to give up one third of his pension – mandarins will also hold a second meeting at which they will consider the fate of other bankers. That committee – chaired by civil service boss Sir Bob Kerslake – will consider evidence due to be published later this year by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and the Financial Conduct Authority into where the blame lies. Catching up with him: Sir George Mathewson ran RBS until Fred Goodwin took the helm in 2000 . For an honour to be removed a recognised watchdog needs to find against the individual. Honours are formally taken away by the Queen. A well-placed source with knowledge of the plans said: ‘Where someone has been criticised for their behaviour at a bank and where they got an honour for services to banking it is hard to see how the committee could do anything but recommend that it is taken away. ‘If the question is put, it will be practically impossible to say “No”, given the public mood and the politics of the situation. Where honours have not been given for banking it will be harder.’ That is bad news for Sir Victor Blank, the former chairman of Lloyds bank, who presided over its disastrous takeover of HBOS. He has always argued that the pitfalls of the deal were not foreseeable. But a recent report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking found that the deal was doomed from the start. It is understood that the Forfeiture Committee will consider his honour and that of Lord Stevenson, the former HBOS chairman. The Banking Commission ruled that responsibility for the near-collapse of the bank ‘lies particularly with Lord Stevenson’. While he cannot be stripped of his peerage by the committee, the knighthood he received in 1997 could be at risk. But insiders admit it will be ‘much more difficult’ to target him because the honour was not awarded for banking. So far Peter Cummings, head of HBOS corporate banking from 2006 to 2008, is the only man to have been punished over the HBOS scandal. He was fined £500,000 last year and banned for life from working in the City.","Whitehall’s Forfeiture Committee will consider which bankers lose titles .

Intern: Savader worked as a vice presidential operations intern for the Romney campaign. He is pictured here with Romney's running mate Paul Ryan . Federal investigators say that he knew each of his 15 victims, either from high school or college. Authorities say Savader, who worked as a vice presidential operations intern during Romney's 2012 bid for the White House, obtained the photos through hacked accounts that belonged to the women. Many of the women are college students who knew Savader from high school. The victims live in Michigan; Long Island, New York; and Washington, D.C. According to a criminal complaint filed in Michigan, a woman listed as 'Victim 1' called police to report that she had received text messages from a person who said his name was 'John Smith.' He claimed that he had nude photos of her and that he would send them to her family if she didn't send more. Arrested: Savader, pictured with Mrs South Carolina 2011 Sarah Farra, was taken into custody after a hearing on Tuesday in New York . Busted: Savader, who also worked on Newt Gingrich's campaign, was . charged with cyberstalking and extortion . through the internet . He then sent her a link to a Photobucket.com account, where she was stunned to find a a photo of herself intended for a former boyfriend, but never posted on the internet. It is alleged that Savader obtained the photos by hacking into her AOL email account and taking stealing the photos. The affidavit says that in another text, 'John Smith' asked her a series of personal questions about her sexual preference and preferred sexual positions. He also informed her that he was masturbating to her photos. Threats: Savader, pictured with Sen Al Franken, allegedly told his victims that he would send their nude photos to their parents, sororities or 'all over Washington' if they didn't comply to his demands . Getting political: Savader, 21, knew each of his 15 victims from either high school or college . In other cases, Savader allegedly threatened his victims, telling one: 'I swear to god don't be stupid. You don't want every1 (sic) including your parents seeing your t*** a** and p****.' Savader is now in custody after appearing in New York federal court on Tuesday. He appears with numerous politicians in photos posted to his Facebook account, including Newt Gingrich (whom he also worked for), Rep Michelle Bachmann and Sen Al Franken. His attorney, Michael Shoshnick, told the New York Daily News: 'I've known Adam his entire life and he has never behaved in a way that would lead me to believe these allegations are true.' The criminal complaint says Savader sent text messages over a Google phone service and identified himself as John Smith. Mover and shaker: Savander's Facebook page is loaded with photos of him with influential Republicans, including former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin .","Adam Savader, 21, charged with cyberstalking and extortion through the internet .

Prolific: Christopher Coulthard, 50, was jailed for four years at Hull Crown Court for stealing from church collection boxes . During his lifetime of sin Christopher Coulthard has crossed the country on his bicycle stealing from more than 630 churches. And after his latest arrest this unrepentant thief complained to probation workers that ‘collection boxes are not what they used to be’, a court heard. Churches may be struggling financially, but that has not stopped Coulthard continuing to burgle safes and collection boxes of cash donated by worshippers. Yesterday Coulthard, 50, was jailed for four years after admitting four burglaries and asking for 34 more to be taken into consideration. Passing sentence at Hull Crown Court, Recorder Julian Smith said the thief had remarked about the ‘poor return you are now getting compared to the good old days’. He told the defendant: ‘The churches you burgle are valued to their community. It matters not whether you are religious. They are treasure for their heritage.’ The Church has borne the brunt of his astonishing life of crime that began when he started committing burglaries at 13. Coulthard has spent about 30 of his 50 years behind bars. He has 26 convictions for 105 offences, with many hundreds more thefts ‘taken into consideration’ by the courts when passing sentence. Over the past 12 years alone Coulthard has admitted about 635 church raids in counties across the length and breadth of the nation. Caught out: Coulthard was finally arrested after worshippers at St Andrews Church, Ulrome, East Yorkshire, noticed him acting suspiciously and called police . Jailed: Recorder Julian Smith sentenced Christopher Coulthard to four years in prison at Hull Crown Court . Riding a bicycle and carrying maps and . an electric drill in his saddlebag, he targeted churches from London to . the Lake District as soon as he was released from his latest jail term . last November. Wendy Foster, prosecuting, said he was . caught by worshippers at  a Sunday service in the village  of Ulrome, . East Yorkshire, who noticed a man acting suspiciously inside the church. Police arrested him on his mountain bike. As on previous occasions, . Coulthard was quick to confess and told officers: ‘If this is about the . churches, I am pleased you found me.’ Richard Thompson, defending, said: . ‘There’s something inherently unpleasant about burgling churches, he . concedes that. There are some hints he plans a different lifestyle in . the future.’ Target: St Martin's Church, Burton Agnes, was one of 34 churches in East Yorkshire where Christopher Coulthard stole money . Criminal acts: He used knitting needles to pick ancient locks and scissors to remove notes from collection boxes (file picture) But he has said that before. In 2003 . Coulthard, of no fixed address, was jailed for four years at Swansea . Crown Court after admitting 15 church burglaries and asking for 502 . similar offences to be taken into consideration. He hid his burglary kit in a camera . case to pass as a tourist and stayed in hotels, committing an average of . two thefts a day. He used knitting needles to pick ancient locks and . scissors to remove notes from collection boxes. Three years later, at Ipswich Crown .

The Red Arrows famous diamond nine formation have been given the all clear to fly again after the deaths of two of their pilots. The display team had been grounded following the deaths of Flight Lieutenant Sean . Cunnigham due the failure of his ejector seat in November 2011 and that . of Flight Lieutenant of Jon Egging at the Bournemouth Air Show in August . 2011. However, they've now been given the nod to fly again after being handed a  Public Display Authority (PDA) by The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton. Scroll down for video . The Red Arrows finally had all of the members of the diamond formation back as they trained in Cyprus . The PDA, which it must get each year, . confirms that the display proposed for the year is safe and meets the . standards expected of a team that represents the Royal Air Force and the . UK. The team were spotted honing their skills on a training mission in Cyprus - training at RAF Akrotiri, in the Mediterranean, in preparation for a summer of displays. Sir Stephen said: 'The Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, the Red Arrows, have designed a display of precision formation flying that encapsulates the agility and demonstrates the pure flying qualities required in the Royal Air Force. 'The Reds are an iconic symbol of the United Kingdom and their displays are vividly demonstrating excellence in precision, teamwork and dynamic flying.' The Chief of the Air Staff , Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton and Air Officer Commanding 22 Group Air Vice-Marshal M Lloyd watch the display . The Red Arrows Display Team will be back in the skies after being awarded a 2013 Public Display Authority . The PDA is effectively a sign-off . that the display programme the Red Arrows are planning - practised . meticulously during the 'closed season' - is safe, an RAF spokesman . said. With changes to the nine-aircraft team, and new manoeuvres added to the routine, the display has to be checked each year. Earlier this year the team flew in . its world famous diamond formation of nine planes, over Lincolnshire, . for the first time in 18 months, then continued practice from RAF . Akrotiri in Cyprus for extra winter training, benefiting from the better . weather conditions. Flight Lieutenant Sean James . Cunningham, 35, was killed when he was ejected from his Hawk T1 while on . the ground at the Red Arrows base at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire. An . inquest heard that that Flt Lt Cunningham had completed ground safety . checks when the ejector seat of his Hawk jet was deployed. The main parachute did not deploy and . the pilot did not become separated from his seat during the incident, . the hearing was told. The Arrows had been suspended following the death of two of their pilots in 2011 . The Arrows perform some of their famous manoevres as they train in Cyprus . He landed on the ground still strapped into his seat. Lieutenant . of Jon Egging died when his single-engine jet went out of control as . they returned to Bournemouth Air Show on Saturday afternoon. Pictures showed how the plane smashed into the ground and then skidded along, gouging a deep crater in the field before finally coming to a standstill. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the . pilot steer away from houses to crash land, with the plane 'bouncing' across a farmer's field before grinding to a halt. The two men had joined the Red Arrows at the same time the previous year. The Red Arrows were formed in 1964 as an all-RAF display team. Since 1966 there have been nine volunteer pilots each year, with ten applicants for each place on the team. The Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton watches the Red Arrows perform from the coast . They must have completed 1,500 flying hours, completed at least one tour on a fast jet, or have been judged as above average as a pilot. Red Arrow pilots can experience forces up top five times the force of gravity and when performing some manoeuvres can reach seven times. In July 2004 there was speculation  that the Red Arrows would be disbanded, after a defence spending review, due to running costs of up to £6million but their role in helping develop business in the defence industry stopped this.","The team have flown with all nine members for the first time since 2011 .

He may only be small, but this one-eyed dachshund has a huge amount of love to give to the woman who saved him from certain death. Captain Morgan was reunited with Eva Armstrong, a director at Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue, a couple of months after she rescued him from a dog pound with a high-kill rate in Alabama. The touching moment Captain Morgan snuggled into the shoulder of the woman who saved him at a reunion block party on May 5, has melted hearts across the world. Dog's best friend: Cappy the dachshund hugs Eva Armstrong from Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue in New York . The picture has been viewed more than 160,000 times since it was posted on Buzzfeed on Friday. 'The look on his face says it all,' one reader commented on BuzzFeed's post. The New York rescue centre has rehomed more than 800 dogs from the South, where animals in rural pounds have a 90 per cent chance of being put down. 'Whenever any of us run into dogs . that we have fostered or rescued, they always recognise us and are so . excited to see us. Dogs remember the person who saved their life and . helped them on their way to a forever home,' Sara Cross, founder of Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue, told the Huffington Post. New lease of life: Cappy plays with other rescue dogs at Eva Armstrong's farm in Pennsylvania . Captain Morgan, who has been renamed Cappy by his new owner, was rescued by Ms Armstrong and a group of volunteers at Badass on their last trip to Alabama. Usually the rescue centre arranges to have saved dogs driven to foster homes in and around New York City, but Ms Armstrong was so taken with the tiny dog that she brought him back herself. 'We don't travel very often to the South,' Ms Cross said. 'But . we did a trip to visit the local volunteers at two of the shelters we . rescue from. When we were down there we met and of course fell in love . with Cappy and brought him back in our van' He was named Captain Morgan because of . his one good eye and the dog, who was initially rescued by Shannon Lynch, . spent his first night of freedom snuggled up on Ms Armstrong's hotel . bed. Cappy stayed with Ms Armstrong at her farmhouse in Pennsylvania until he was ready to be rehomed in Brooklyn. Forever home: After his near-death experience Cappy is settling into his new home in New York . Incredible journey: Cappy relaxes at his home after being saved from a dog pound in Alabama by volunteers . At the Alabama pound Cappy was saved from, 97 per cent of the dogs that find themselves there are killed. Some . of the dog pounds that Badass volunteers search, in the hope of giving . the healthy dogs a second chance, use methods such as gas chambers to . put the animals down. Ms Cross said: 'Cappy would not be alive were it not for a small group of dedicated volunteers in Selma, Alabama.' She added: 'We would not even know these dogs exist, let alone be able to rescue them, if it were not for amazing volunteers.' The dedicated volunteers devote their time and energy to photographing dogs in the county pounds, posting the pictures to Facebook, testing the temperament of the dogs and dealing with government officials and shelter directors to have the animals released. Puppy love: Cappy with Eva Armstrong after his rescue by volunteers in Alabama . Being freed from the pound is the just the first step in a long journey for the dogs. The volunteers who rescue them foster them in the South until they are physically and emotionally ready to move to New York to be rehomed. Unlike some rescue shelters, Badass does not have a rehoming centre. Instead, a network of volunteers are relied on to foster dogs and prepare them for living in a home environment, before suitable owners are found. As well as relying on a community of dedicated volunteers who vow to never give up on a dog in their care, Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue survives on donations. The group is always looking for volunteers and potential new owners. It posts updates on the dogs and their progress on its Facebook page at Badass Brooklyn Foster Dog.","Dachshund saved from Alabama animal centre by network of volunteers .

The mastermind behind a plot to smuggle over £200 million worth of cocaine has been jailed for almost 20 years. Stephen Brown, 46, organised a project to take the Class A drugs to Ireland over from the Caribbean in July 2007. Brown, of no fixed address, admitted two counts of conspiracy to supply a controlled drug to another country. Jailed: Stephen Brown has been sentenced to almost 20 years in jail after the attempted drug operation . Brown's 'mastermind' operation took a turn for the worse after his crew overloaded their inflatable boat when the drugs were being transferred from a catamaran at sea. The boat struggled to maintain balance in the nine feet waves as Brown's gang tried to land the cargo in the remote Dunlough Bay off Mizen Head in southwest Cork, July 2007. The boat eventually sank leaving 62 bales of high-quality cocaine floating in the water. Brown was jailed today after being extradited from Spain earlier this year, where he had been serving a six and half year sentence for drug smuggling. Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC said: ‘This was a large criminal enterprise which potentially had significant rewards if it had proceeded as planned. ‘Just over 1500kg of cocaine at a high purity, with a street value of over £200 million came from the Caribbean, destined for the Republic of Ireland. Clean up: A crew recovers the 62 bales of high-quality cocaine that were left floating in the water . ‘But they ended up in the sea before they could be brought here. ‘The Court of Appeal has described this case as one of the utmost gravity. 'You were an organiser of this project, influencing others, and were in charge of sourcing the drugs and must have been expecting a significant financial gain.’ Two years ago, former Scotland Yard drug squad officer Michael Daly, 51, was jailed for 22 years along with Alan John Wells, 58, for 14 years. Daly’s brother Joe was also sentenced to 25 years over the smuggling plot, as well as Martin Wanden, 47, and convicted killer Perry Wharrie, 52, who were both handed 30-year sentences after a trial in Cork, Ireland. Wharrie had previously served 17 years for shooting Pc Frank Mason in the back as he tried to stop a bank robbery in Hemel Hempstead, Herts, in 1988, and was released from his life term in 2005. Gerard Hagan, was handed a reduced 10-year jail term after alerting the coast guards to the sinking boat, which saved Wanden’s life in a dramatic helicopter rescue. Police suspect that as many as 10 people could have travelled from Britain to west Cork to take part in the pick-up. Daly was already serving eight years for masterminding an almost identical operation after smuggling £4million worth of cocaine on to a remote beach in Kent. Other alleged gang members yet to be caught include 49-year-old Robert Ferguson - dubbed ‘The Ferrari Fugitive’ - who is thought to be in hiding in the Spanish Costas. Another alleged plotter Lee Dryden, 48, has recently been arrested in Portugal and is set to be extradited to the UK. Brown was sentenced to 19 years and 360 days exactly -  taking into account the five days he spent in custody in Spain awaiting transfer back to the UK.","Stephen Brown jailed today for almost 20 years after being extradited from Spain earlier this year .

Russia's Federal Security Bureau has breached protocol to name the man they say is in charge of the CIA's work in Moscow. A spokesman for the bureau named the CIA's 'rezident' while speaking to Russian media about the capture of alleged spy Ryan Fogle. The diplomat's name matched that of a U.S. embassy counsellor in a recent directory of foreign officials in Moscow, reports the Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . Arrested: The US diplomat was pinned to the ground and arrested by the Russian agent he was trying to recruit . Claims: The FSB counter intelligence service said the envoy, a third secretary in the political section of the American embassy was caught red handed seeking to recruit a Russian intelligence officer . It is customary for Russia and the U.S. to tell each other who their top embassy officials are, and the move is likely to provoke anger in Washington. The two countries agreed to work together to share intelligence for the investigation into the Boston Marathon bombings. The alleged bombers, brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaevas, are said to have links to Russia's North Caucasus region. Embarrassment for the CIA's wig-wearing Agent Blond deepened this week as it was revealed he was detained by the very FSB officer he was seeking to recruit. Undercover diplomat Fogle has been mercilessly mocked on the web both in Russia and the West for his apparently amateurish Boy's Own approach to espionage in Moscow. But the FSB claimed that the Russian anti-terrorism expert he was hoping to lure to treachery wasted no time in personally apprehending him, pinning him to the ground, and handing him over to the authorities. Detained: The FSB said Fogle was in possession of two floppy wigs, three pairs of glasses, a map of Moscow and a folding knife when he was detained . Seized: After his arrest, he was taken to the FSB headquarters at the Lubyanka, in Moscow, and later handed over to the US embassy in keeping with diplomatic protocols . 'The man behaved like an officer . worthy of his name, detaining the recruiter and handing him over to . counterintelligence authorities' said an FSB source yesterday. 'He will continue to serve. There is no threat to his career.' The Russians have not named the . target of the CIA approach but he is believed to be a specialist in . terrorism linked to extremist Islamic groupings. Fogle called him seeking a meeting at which he intended to recruit him, it is claimed. Instead he ended up face on the . ground, and handcuffed, before being taken to the notorious Lubyanka HQ . of the secret services for questioning. FBI agents first came across the . Russian agent when they were given assistance by Moscow over the Boston . marathon bombings, it is understood. Fogle, 29, a third secretary in the . embassy's political department, was detained wearing a blond wig under . his baseball cap while on a mission to recruit the FSB operative on the . night of May 13. In his possession, Fogle had another . wig, a compass, a map of Moscow, sunglasses, and a 'Dear Friend' letter - . apparently translated into Russian on Google - which offered $1million . a year plus bonuses to the FSB man. Fogle has been ordered to leave Russia in the next few days following his return to U.S. representatives in the city. Statement: 'Recently, the US intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of Russian law enforcement agencies and special services,' according to the FSB .

Mission: The website of the American embassy in Russia informs that its Political Section is engaged in 'bringing to the attention of the Russian government the US position on the issues of foreign policy and security' Questions: A letter the agent carried suggested the US government was willing to pay up to $1million a year plus bonuses to his unidentified potential Russian recruit, if the letter released by the FSB is genuine . Release: Fogle was held overnight before being released to U.S. officials and expelled from Russia . The arrest of Ryan Fogle is just the latest twist in the long history of spying between the U.S. and Russia. Famously, 10 Russian sleeper agents were arrested in June 2010 and accused of pretending to be ordinary Americans while secretly plotting against the country. The best-known is Anna Chapman, above, who has become a major celebrity in her home country since being deported from the U.S. In the Cold War period, however, U.S.-Soviet espionage was often a matter of life and death - in 1985, military officer Arthur D. Nicholson was shot dead by a Soviet sentry while spying in East Germany. One of the war's major crises was caused by the shooting down of an American spy plane in 1960 and the subsequent capture of its pilot. The FSB stressed yesterday that the . US and Russia 'will try to avoid ratcheting up tension around the Ryan . Fogle case, focusing instead on the positive aspects of their . relations'. But Russian intelligence services say they have trapped a CIA ‘spy’ as he offered millions of pounds to a senior Russian agent. Diplomat . Ryan Fogle was thrown down and handcuffed in a night-time sting by the . FSB secret service – formerly the KGB. He had a rudimentary espionage kit . containing a compass, map of Moscow, knives, a microphone, two wigs, . three pairs of glasses, plastic bags containing thousands of euros and . an RFID Shield, which prevents passports with computer chips being read . remotely, Russian intelligence sources said. The ‘agent’, a third secretary in the . political section of the US embassy, was quizzed in the FSB’s feared . Lubyanka complex before being handed over to US officials. Unusually, the FSB made its coup . public at once. It released pictures of a man being arrested in a blue . checked shirt, dirty-blond wig and  baseball cap, along with images of . him in detention. Spy sources said Fogle was . caught after a lengthy covert operation. US ambassador Michael McFaul – . who refused to comment on the news – has been summoned to Russia’s . foreign ministry. Fogle was caught in Vorontsovski Park, an area in south-east Moscow, the FSB said. They implied that he wanted to contact a senior FSB agent who was snooping on Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the alleged Boston bomber. A letter in Russian which Fogle . carried suggests – if genuine – that the CIA hoped to reel in a big . fish. Addressed ‘Dear friend’, it states: ‘We are ready to offer you . $100,000 [£65,000] and discuss your experience, expertise and . co-operation, and the payment may go much higher if you are ready to . answer certain questions. ‘For long-term co-operation we offer $1million [£650,000] per year.’ The recruit is instructed to use an . internet cafe to ‘create a new Gmail mailbox which you will use only for . staying in touch with us’. The incident is the biggest spy . scandal since the arrest of glamorous agent Anna Chapman and nine other . Russians in the US in 2010.

So-called eco-friendly cars are facing a crackdown in London after a scheme to encourage motorists to switch to ‘greener’ alternatives has started to make air more toxic. Transport for London is to remove the Congestion Charge exemption for diesels and some Hybrids because soaring sales has increased pollution and traffic. Diesels now account for one in two sales, but emit 22 times more soot particulates than petrol cars. End of the road: Diesel and Hybrid cars are set to lose their London Congestion Charge exemption because booming sales has led to increased polution . The U-Turn has provoked an outcry from motoring organisations, who accused authorities of moving the ‘green goalposts’. And the move is also expected to cause anger among motorists who bought their cars to take advantage of the exemption. Edmund King, AA president, told the Evening Standard: ‘We do have real concerns about “green goalposts” being moved after drivers and businesses have invested in low-emission hybrid and diesel vehicles. We need to encourage the take-up of a range of greener vehicles.’ Out of favour: Toyota Prius is one of more than 50 'greener' cars which are set to lose their Congestion Charge exemption .

More than 50 ‘green’ models, which . includes the petrol/electric Toyota Prius — a favourite among . environmentally conscious drivers  - will no longer be exempt from the . £10 charge. The move will come into force in July if approved by Boris Johnson. It is understood the changes to the pricing will generate up to an extra £2 million a year. The additional revenue will go some way to plugging the £60 million lost since the abandoning the Congestion Charge’s western extension. About 70,000 motorists a day enter the congestion zone, with 2,500 qualifying for Transport for London’s Greener Vehicle Discount because they emit less than 100g/km of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. TfL wants to scrap this limit and replace it with a much tougher 75g/km maximum in a new scheme — which effectively rules out all hybrid and diesel vehicles now on the road. David Bizley, the RAC’s technical director, said that only pure electric cars are likely to meet those new rigorous pollution restrictions. Applications for the Greener Vehicle Discount would cease to be accepted from July. But drivers already registered would continue to qualify for the exemption until June 2015. TfL, which made a £136.8 million net profit from the congestion charge in 2011/12, believes the existing system ‘creates an incentive’ for owners of hybrid and diesel cars to enter the zone. It fears the number could more than double to 6,000 ‘free’ cars a day by the end of this year. The new rules would sit alongside a £10 increase in penalty fines — taking them to £130 — and the closure of C-charge payment points in shops and petrol stations. These changes would generate a further £2.5 million a year.","Soaring sales of Congestion Charge exempt eco-cars making air quality worse .

Ministers engineered a partial climbdown over plans to reform Britain’s libel laws last night amid claims that they are strangling free speech. The Ministry of Justice said it would listen to complaints that the plans will allow big companies to silence their critics. MPs rejected plans passed by the House of Lords which would have made it impossible for a company to sue unless they could show that they have suffered significant financial loss. But Justice Minister Helen Grant last night offered to look again at the issue of financial losses - hinting that the government would bring in a fresh amendment in the House of Lords next week to strengthen the safeguards. She said: ‘I am aware of the strength of the feeling that exists on this particular issue and whether or not there should be specific provision in the Bill requiring non-natural persons, trading for profit, to show substantial financial loss. ‘Such bodies are likely in practise to show some actual or likely financial loss anyway. 'But I can confirm that we are prepared to actively consider that aspect of the amendment further and we will of course listen very carefully to the views expressed in both houses.’ But ministers refused to give ground on another measure that critics say will gag the critics of big business. MPs voted by own plans which would have made it impossible for companies working for the government to sue. It is already illegal for Whitehall departments and councils to sue. That means that firms who perform government contracts or fun facilities like prisons can use the law to stifle criticism of their use of public money. The Conservative move to ban companies who do public work from suing was backed by the Liberal Democrats despite the fact the party specifically supported the reforms in its manifesto. Miss Grant said: ‘Although the provision focuses on criticisms in connection with the exercise of public functions, that criticism could of course have a wider impact on the reputations of a business more generally.’ Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan warning that move could 'chill free speech' because people would feel threatened by the financial muscle of big businesses.

'Just because a school, prison or hospital is run by a private company doesn’t mean it should be insulated from public criticism.' Sile Lane, of Sense About Science, which had also demanded changes, said: ‘We still need to see a hurdle for corporations to prevent bullying and a level playing field for those criticising public service providers.

A drug addict accused of chopping off a woman's head in a Tenerife shop was a 'ticking time bomb' who was let down by social services, a court heard today. Deyan Deyanov, 29, butchered Jennifer Mills-Westley, 60, with a nine-inch knife just weeks after being released onto the streets from a psychiatric unit, it was said. Mrs Mills-Westley, a grandmother-of-five, might still be alive today if the Spanish authorities had done their jobs properly, defence lawyer Francisco Beltran told the court. 'Sick': Deyanov was described as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and heard 'irresistable' voices in his head . Deyan Deyanov is accused of stabbing and beheading 60-year-old Jennifer Mills-Westley with a nine-inch knife . 'He might as well have been carrying a sign saying ""I'm a bomb and I could explode at any moment""', defence lawyer Francisco Beltran said. 'Responsibility must fall to some extent with the health authorities in the Canary Islands,' he added. 'My client is a sick man, not a criminal, and he should have been diagnosed and treated. 'Why was he not diagnosed and treated properly? He was suffering from acute paranoid schizophrenia. Why was he released?' Deyanov, a Bulgarian immigrant who took crack cocaine and LSD, was arrested several times for outbursts of violence in the months leading up to the murder. After one arrest he was admitted on January 18 in 2011 to a psychiatric unit at the island's Candalaria hospital. But he was released on February 4, despite suffering from serious mental health problems. Mr Beltran was summing up on the third day of Deyanov's trial for murdering Mrs Mills-Westley, from Norwich, Norfolk. She . was killed in a random attack in a Chinese-owned general store in Los . Cristianos, a resort in the south of the island where she owned an . apartment. Earlier the jury heard Deyanov killed her by slashing her throat from behind with the knife, meant for cutting Spanish ham. She died within seconds but he then spent up to five minutes removing her head, a pathologist said. Angel . Perez Martinez told the jury Deyanov used 'great force' to sever the . head with 'a practically uncountable number of cuts. It is very . difficult to remove a head with a knife of this sort,' he said. 'It . would have taken minutes - three, four, five minutes.' Mrs . Mills-Westley also had cuts on her hands where she had tried in vain to . fight off her attacker, he said. Jennifer Mills-Westley (left) was killed in Tenerife, her daughter Samantha (right) at court today . The daughters of deceased Jennifer Mills-Westley Sarah and Samantha listened to the defence lawyer today . Deyanov's DNA was also found under her fingernails, the court heard. The victim's daughters Samantha, 39, and Sarah, 43, sat quietly in the public gallery with her brother John Smith, 63, while the gruesome details of her death were heard in Spanish. Deyanov was overpowered and arrested after running out of the shop with the head in his hands, following the attack on 13 May 2011. Psychiatrists Julio Guija Villa and Pedro Garcia Gallardo, who treated Deyanov after his arrest, said he suffers from acute paranoid schizophrenia and hears 'irresistible' voices in his head ordering him to kill. He believed he was a 'prophet of God', they said, adding that his hallucinations were made worse by regular drink and drug use. Prosecutor Angel Garcia Rodriguez called for Deyanov to be convicted of murder and locked up for the maximum 20 years. The defence lawyer called for his acquittal, but said that if he is convicted of murder he should be sentenced to the minimum of 15 years. Deyanov, in handcuffs and wearing a beige jumper, black tracksuit bottoms and white trainers, was asked if he had anything to say in his defence. 'I am Jesus Christ,' he replied in Bulgarian. On Wednesday a British couple from Warrington, Cheshire, described the horrific moment Deyanov allegedly plunged a knife into Mrs Mills-Westley's neck. Susan Bennison said the Bulgarian looked 'wild, unclean and not human-looking' while carrying out the attack. Her husband Kenneth said he wanted to help but ran with his wife from the shop when they realised there was nothing they could do. Deyanov denies murder at the Provincial Court in the island's capital Santa Cruz. The jury of nine is expected to retire to consider its verdict tomorrow/this morning.

Control: Philip Davies MP says the EU wishes to punish media that is critical of its corruption . Brussels is pumping millions of pounds of public money into groups dedicated to stifling a free Press, it emerged yesterday. The European Commission is helping to fund groups seeking state-backed regulation of newspapers, including key allies of Hugh Grant’s Hacked Off campaign. One – called Mediadem – has a mission statement to ‘reclaim a free and independent media’ and is demanding tougher sanctions than ‘an apology or correction’. The EU has spent £2.3million on the previously unpublicised project. The commission says it wants to be a ‘moral compass’ against press misconduct and is seeking new national and Europe-wide regulatory powers against newspapers. But critics say it is only taking such a stance because of the unfavourable coverage that European institutions get in the Press. Philip Davies, a Tory member of the Culture Select Committee, said: ‘Given the scandals in the EU and revelations of its misappropriation of funding, it is no surprise that Europe wants to restrict the free press which can uncover its corruption. ‘And it shows up exactly the sort of body that Hacked Off is if it wants to ally itself with these sorts of people.’ A policy brief for Mediadem, co-authored by its lead British researcher, Rachael Craufurd Smith, says it is ‘simplistic’ to see state influence over the Press as ‘inherently stifling’. Mediadem recently produced ‘recommendations for the UK’ demanding the ‘imposition of sanctions beyond an apology or correction’ on errant media outlets and the ‘co-ordination of the journalistic profession at the European level’. Dr Craufurd Smith, from Edinburgh University, also called for further chilling action against the Press to ensure ‘that neither the media, nor those individuals who own or work for the media, enjoy an absolute right to freedom of expression’. Some of the organisations are key allies of Hacked Off, which has celebrity backers like actor Hugh Grant . The recommendations demand the Press be controlled by the same body and on the same basis as broadcasters, who currently face stricter regulations including statutory ‘balance’ obligations that do not apply to newspapers. Dr Craufurd Smith told the Sunday Telegraph that the EU funding may have been prompted by Brussels’ belief that the Press treats it unfairly. As well as Mediadem, there are at least five other initiatives backed by Brussels to increase its powers over the media. One, MediaAcT, has channelled about £100,000 of European cash directly to a key Hacked Off ally, the Mediawise campaign group. Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said last night: ‘It is ‘strange if the EU is investing in ways to set up bureaucratic interference with the free Press’.","Brussels flows money to organisations opposing press freedom .

Celebrating: Talhat Rehman gives the V for victory sign at Southwark Crown Court after he was spared jail today . A butcher Tasered by police outside Buckingham Palace as he held a carving knife to his own throat while demanding to deliver a letter to the Queen has been spared jail today. Talhat Rehman, 55, sparked terror among tourists after holding the eight-inch blade to his throat during the Changing of the Guard ceremony screaming 'I want to die'. Rehman then pressed a second knife to his chest while threatening to kill himself and this afternoon was given a year of mental health treatment instead of a prison sentence. He was heard to say ‘stay back, I will do it, I will do it’ before being Tasered with 50,000 volts and being disarmed by police on February 3 this year. Rehman, a father-of-five and grandfather of 18 was considering threatening the Queen and killing his own family in despair at an ongoing legal dispute, Southwark Crown Court heard. The former owner of Kassam Halal Meat in Kingsbury, north west London, wanted to appeal to Her Majesty directly over claims a solicitor stole £168,000 from him. But the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were at their Sandringham Estate in Norfolk at the time. Rehman admitted two counts of knife possession and was ordered to undergo mental health treatment. Judge Alistair McCreath said: ‘This is a man whose mental health has been shattered by life’s events. ‘I am perfectly satisfied that whatever impression he may have given through his movements and actions, he had no intention to harm anyone except himself.’ He continued: ‘You were genuinely convinced you have been denied justice by legal manipulation on the part of a person you believed defrauded you. ‘This belief has become almost obsessional with you to the point where it has driven you mad.’ Smartly dressed in a black suit, white shirt and red tie, Rehman bowed his head after sentence and simply said: ""Yes"" when asked if he agreed to a 12-month mental health treatment and supervision order. The judge added: ‘Just don’t ever do this again, it’s stupid so far as you’re concerned and it’s not great for the public having to see people doing what you were doing.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Onlookers watched as Rehman jumped the barricades waving an eight inch knife and a smaller blade . The halal butcher was Tasered by officers who then seized the knives . Rehman had crossed into a ‘sterile area’ cordoned off by police to members of the public before being Tasered, the court heard. ‘He placed a kitchen knife to his throat with his right hand, and had another kitchen knife in his left hand, which he had held to chest,’ said prosecutor Peter Zinner. ‘Mr Rehman was then heard to repeatedly shout that he was going to kill himself. ‘Officers were alarmed by the incident as were members of the public. ‘Officers were told by him “stay back, stay back or I will do it.” ‘At that stage, other police officers were alerted and observe the defendant repeatedly thrust the knives towards his throat and chest. ‘Police genuinely believed he wanted to kill himself. ‘He was shouting “I want to die.” ‘Police armed themselves with Tasers and tried to get the defendant to calm down and thrown down the knives. ‘He continued to make threats and one stage appeared to lunge towards one of the officers, slashing the knives in a slashing movement. ‘At that stage police had no choice but to deploy Taser.’ Rehman dropped to the ground before he was formally arrested and restrained. He admitted he had taken the enormous carving knives from a butcher’s shop owned by his son. Rehman has a history of mental illness and a background of ‘psychotic episodes’. After the incident, it emerged Rehman, who has a history of psychotic episodes, wanted to appeal directly to the Queen for help after he lost £170,000 in a botched business deal . The court heard how Rehman fell to the floor after being shocked and officers were able to retrieve the knives . Mr Zinner said: ‘He was admitted to hospital for treatment last year. ‘Discharge notes suggest he had been having difficulties in relation to a previous business arrangement he had with a solicitor who he blames for current or ongoing financial difficulties. ‘When he was discharged from Park Royal Hospital he was also having thoughts about killing his family, making threats to the Queen and taking his own life. ‘Delusions or not, beyond that the crown is gravely concerned for the protection of the public and for himself.’ Gillian Frost, defending, said Rehman genuinely believed he had been ripped off. His family claim he lost his savings and business after being defrauded in a property deal by a lawyer who is no longer believed to be practicing. Rehman was told by police to fight a civil case due to insufficient evidence to prosecute the solicitor. ‘It is clear this has placed a great deal of pressure on him,’ said Ms Frost. Rehman, of Kenton, north west London, admitted two counts of having an article with a blade or point. A further charge of affray was dropped after prosecutors offered no evidence. He was sentenced to a 12-month community order, including treatment at Central Middlesex Hospital by mental health professionals and supervision by the probation service during the same period.","Talhat Rehman shot with 50,000-volt Taser after threatening to kill himself .

A top chartered surveyor was run over and killed by a car while lying in a road after having two bottles of wine during eight hours of drinking, an inquest heard today. Caroline Vaughan-Salter, 49, was killed almost instantly after she was struck by a car on Hyde Park roundabout in central London, the hearing was told. She was described as a 'warm, kind and caring mother'. Mystery still surrounds how exactly she ended up lying across the busy junction, but the inquest heard how she had drank two bottles of red wine with work colleagues before making her way home. The mother-of-three, a director at estate agent Stiles Harold Williams, was last seen on CCTV at the south east corner of Hyde Park roundabout crossing to the central island. A toxicology report revealed that Ms Vaughan-Salter, a director of chartered surveyors Stiles Harold Williams, was around three times over the drink-drive limit at the time of her death. She was almost three times the drink drive limit with 230mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood. Coroner Darren Stewart said she was so drunk it could have brought on a coma resulting in her collapse. The inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court heard how she was hit by a sliver Seat Leon driven by Richard Reid just before 9.30pm on October 16 last year. On the day of the accident, Ms Vaughan-Salter and her colleague Nigel Amos left their office at 1.30pm for a meeting. The pair went to Cafe Concerto in Piccadily, and stayed there until 4.30pm drinking six glasses of red wine each. They moved on to the Three Crowns Pub, on Babmaes Street, where they met more work friends and continued drinking. Mr Amos, an associate at Stiles Harold Williams, said: 'That day she seemed happy. 'She suggested we go out for lunch for a spontaneous meeting about generating business. Driver: Richard Reid (left) mistook the woman lying in the road for 'rubbish', he told the inquest. Mr Vaughan-Slater's stockbroker ex-husband Dominic Waters (right) told the hearing that most people wouldn't have driven over debris that resembled the body out of fear of damaging the car . 'We moved on to the pub and I would say we were getting drunk at this point. I had already drank three glasses of wine and Caroline had drank the same as me. 'At the pub we ordered another two bottles of wine between four of us. In total I would say we both drank two bottles of red wine each.' Aysha Taylor, another colleague, met the pair later in the evening. She told the inquest that Ms Vaughan-Salter, of Fulham, west London, was drunk by the time she got there, but was coherent. She said: 'It was clear that she had had a drink. She was quite merry. 'She was perfectly coherent, but she clearly had consumed alcohol because she was louder than normal and more tactile.' Accident scene: Ms Vaughan-Salter, 49, died after being struck by a car on Hyde Park roundabout on October 16 last year . Ms Vaughan-Salter, Mr Amos and Ms Taylor then decided to return to the office to collect their items and make their way home. Ms Vaughan-Salter told her colleagues she would get a taxi home, while Ms Taylor and Mr Amos walked to Green Park station. It . was around this time that Richard Reid, a delivery driver, was driving . back from his pregnant girlfriend's house in Grove Park to his home in . Kensal Green, north west London. 'I thought it was rubbish in the road,' he told the inquest. The cars were going past it. There was nobody swerving. I continued driving. I had a feeling inside straight away that something did not feel right'- Driver Richard Reid tells the inquest . As he crossed the roundabout he saw 'rubbish' in the road and decided to drive on - without realising it was the businesswoman who was lying on her back. He hit her at around 20mph. 'I thought it was rubbish in the road,' he told the inquest. 'The cars were going past it. There was nobody swerving. 'I continued driving. I had a feeling inside straight away that something did not feel right. 'I got out of the car and when I got closer I saw a body and I started screaming. I shouted out ""she was in the road, she was in road"". 'I was uncontrollable. I did not think for a millisecond that it was a person. I thought it was debris in the road. I was a mess. I tried so hard not to replay it in my head for ages.' Ms Vaughan-Salter’s ex-husband, stockbroker Dominic Waters was allowed to address the hearing and suggested to Mr Reid: ‘Most adults in this room are drivers and we wouldn’t drive over something in the road with the form of a body for fear of damaging the car.’ Speaking very quietly, he replied: ‘I just thought it was debris.’ PC Andrew Osborne said that the section of road where Ms Vaughan-Salter's body was found was shadowed slightly and it would have been difficult for Mr Reid to have known a body was in the road. Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner Darren Stewart said: 'It's clear to all of those involved that she had consumed alcohol, quite a considerable amount. 'The level of intoxication would have seriously impaired her ability to judge what was a safe place to cross the road and take her on a route from work to her home address.' Describing her injuries as 'unsurviveable', Coronor Stewart said a post-mortem revealed Ms Vaughan-Stewart also suffered from an undetected heart problem which could have caused her collapse. He added: 'She was a living and caring mother who invested a considerable amount of time in her children. 'She was a beautiful and glamorous, with a quirky sense of humour.'","Caroline Vaughan-Salter, 49, was mistaken for a bag of rubbish by driver .

A British animal lover spared no expense when she spent £2,500 to rescue a stray cat from a life on the streets in China. Angela Burrell, 33, of Warsett Crescent, Skelton, in Teesside, spotted the homeless cat Kandinsky during her five years in China teaching English. She has now admitted her good turn has cost her about £2,500 in injections, treatments and flights. But she says the cat is a friend for life and worth every penny. Angela Burrell spotted the homeless cat Kandinsky while working in China and has now brought him back home to the UK . Ms Burrell took in Kandinsky (pictured in her Chinese apartment) after she spotted him in the street, mewing and feeling sorry for himself . Ms Burrell has been working in the north east of China, close to Beijing, on an intensive International TEFL programme, teaching English as part of a foreign language course. She spotted Kandinsky - named after a friend and a Russian artist - in the street, mewing and feeling sorry for himself. The black and white stray stole her heart with his friendly character and white face and socks. Ms Burrell said: 'He was feeling very sorry for himself and I decided I wanted to bring him back home to Skelton with me. 'But he had to pass a blood test and in January this year I got him all his jabs and permissions. 'It's no longer necessary to quarantine cats now as the regulations have changed. Ms Burell has admitted her good turn has cost her about £2,500 in injections, treatments and flights. Pictured right is Kandinsky in Ms Burrell's apartment in China . 'I believe I'm the first person in that area of China to do this.' Sparing no cost, Kandinsky flew home to Britain first class in the hold via British Airways, while Ms Burrell took a far cheaper Russian airline flight, changing at Moscow. She said: 'My sister Jo came to meet us at Heathrow. She's also an animal lover and recently started a dog walking and pet house sitting business based in Guisborough. 'He was feeling very sorry for himself and I decided I wanted to bring him back home to Skelton with me' - Angela Burrell . 'Kandinsky's about two years old and is very affectionate. My apartment in China was tiny so he's been enjoying the space in Skelton in our garden. 'I take him out in a harness and everyone loves it. It's been an adventure, but it's great now I've got him back to the UK.' Ms Burrell was volunteering with animal charity Pet100 and acknowledges the help she received in China. Next, Kandinsky will be travelling to America in the next few months when Ms Burrell meets up with her boyfriend Abe Bazan to work out there, again teaching English. Ms Burrell is currently living at home with father Peter, 74, and mother Barbara, 63. She also has two sisters Jo, 31 and Heather, 29, who lives in Amsterdam. A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs confirmed that if people follow the rules to the letter regarding cats, quarantine is no longer needed.","Angela Burrell met homeless cat Kandinsky while working in China .

An Eastern European 'Fagin' who is accused of masterminding one of the biggest child pick-pocketing rings in history appears in a French court today. Fehim Hamidovic, a grandfather from Bosnia, allegedly earned more than £1million a year - much of it coming from British tourists - which he spent on holiday homes, luxury cars and high-rolling casino trips. He is said to have controlled a network of up to 500 young girls on the streets of Paris, whom he threatened with beatings, cigarette burns to the face and even rape if they failed to steal at least £250 every day. Hamidovic, 60, apparently told his gang of Roma gypsies from countries like Romania and Bulgaria to concentrate on Asians, who were considered particularly easy targets, and also stole from Britons visiting the French capital. When the criminal ring was dismantled in 2010, police said it was responsible for around 75 per cent of all thefts in the Paris metro system. Hamidovic is among 21 defendants, including his wife and two of his sons, appearing at the Palais de Justice on charges of people trafficking, criminal association and forcing minors to commit crimes. Hamidovic, who faces up to 20 years in prison, denies all the charges, but has been told to explain how he afforded a villa in Rome, a £55,000 Porsche Cayenne, and regular trips to a casino where he would bet at least £140,000 each time. He has never declared any income to the taxman, but bought a second home for more than a quarter of a million pounds before his arrest. Tourists: The criminal gang apparently targeted visitors to Paris including Britons and especially Asians . Police believe that Hamidovic’s gang earned him more than £1million in 2009 alone, enabling him to buy Ferrari sports cars and designer jewellery including a £28,000 diamond ring. Claiming that his references he made to his possessions in taped phone calls were purely fantasy, Hamidovic told the court: ‘We gypsies tend to boast about things that aren't necessarily true.’ The court has heard testimonies from two girls, Carla, 14, and Fadida, 11, from the former Yugoslavia, who said they regularly transferred their Paris earnings to a safe haven in Nice. If the takings were less than £55,000 a week, the girls said they would be ‘beaten’. Fagin: Hamidovic has been compared to the sinister criminal boss from Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist . Hamidovic said the girls were part of a plot to incriminate him by a rival Bosnian gangster known as ‘Elvis’. He even claimed that the girls had self-harmed so as to make it look as though he was responsible for beating them up. ‘There are 500 women and children involved,' he said. 'I'm accused in this affair but have nothing to do with it. It's Elvis.' Hamidovic’s lawyer, Joseph Cohen-Sabban, said: ‘He says he sells cars and that's how he makes his money. There's no doubt he's paid little tax in his life, which explains his comfortable lifestyle - but does that mean the money comes from theft, that's not at all sure.’ The case continues.

A New York City executive dumped twice by his ex-fiance has settled a lawsuit he had brought against her after claiming she owed him tens of thousands of dollars in deposits and reservations for their wedding that never was. The second time Kendra Platt-Lee, a 28-year-old ex-Hooters girl, broke up with Steven Silverstein, 30, she did it by phone from 2,800 miles away - hours after withdrawing $54,000 from their joint back account. Mr Silverstein was demanding nearly $50,000 from his former flame - $19,000 from the bank account withdrawal, $14,000 for half of the rent he paid while they were living together and $13,500 for half of the deposits he put down for the wedding. Closure: Steven Silverstein has settled his legal dispute with ex-fiance Kendra Platt-Lee who called off their wedding in April 2012 six months before the big day . Happier times: Steven Silverstein and Kendra Platt-Lee met on a cross-country flight in 2008 . Ms Platt-Lee had contested her ex’s claims, insisting she had paid her share. She claimed their . relationship had ended 'amicably' after she sent him back her $32,000 diamond wedding ring in May 2012. Silverstein’s lawyer, Elliott Martin, . confirmed to the Daily News that the case was settled last month, but said the monetary details were . confidential. The two met aboard a cross-country flight in 2008. He was a high-flying account executive for AT&T and she was a stewardess. He swept her off her feet and convinced her to move across the country from San Diego, California, to New York. In March 2008, they started dating and got engaged in August 2009. Pricey: The pair had put down a deposit of more than $16,000 to reserve The Allegria Hotel in Long Beach, New York, for their proposed wedding in front of 150 guests . West coast beauty: Miss Platt-Lee, pictured here with a family member, had moved to New York from San Diego to live with Mr Silverstein .

Mr Silverstein also claimed he had personally paid $27,000 to reserve a wedding band, deejay and photographer. He claims they had agreed to each pay half the cost of the wedding and that Ms Platt-Lee had agreed to eventually pay him back her share. Then things went sour. On April 13, 2012 Ms Platt-Lee went back home to California for a 'one-week visit.' After ten days, she withdrew more than $54,000 from their joint checking account.

Support for the UK Independence Party has grown with two opinion polls giving the party record levels of support. An Opinium poll put Nigel Farage's party on 20 per cent, while a ComRes survey put them on 19 per cent. The ComRes poll for the Sunday Mirror and Independent on Sunday found support for Nigel Farage's party was up four per cent since the last survey a month ago, with Labour down three points to 35 per cent, the Conservatives down one to 29 per cent and the Liberal Democrats were unchanged on eight per cent. Nigel Farage outside the Canon's Gait Pub, Edinburgh on Thursday. The UKIP leader retreated from protestors but will be in a more buoyant mood following latest poll figures . Farage has no need to hold recruitment signs (pic right) as his party enjoys an unprecedented surge in support. He appeared on last Sunday's Andrew Marr in a discussion about an EU referendum and his party's supporters . Despite a week of controversy, in . which UKIP leader Nigel Farage visited Edinburgh and was trapped in a pub . by angry protestors, public backing for the party has never been . higher. The UK Independence . Party leader said the left-wing extremists who trapped him were the . ‘ugly face of Scottish nationalism’ pursuing an anti-English agenda. However, . poll results do not reflect the crowds who just this week shouted . 'racist scumbag' and 'scum' at the leader, who has begun to pose a real . threat as a major political party. The Opinium poll for the Observer put Labour on 37 per cent, Tories on 27 per cent and the Lib Dems on seven per cent. According to the ComRes study 46 per cent of Britons would vote to leave the European Union in a referendum now, compared with 24 per cent who would stay in. But if some powers were returned to the UK from Brussels 43 per cent would vote to remain in the EU, with just 24 per cent determined to see Britain leave. Farage's popularity was not mirrored in Edinburgh, where he said 'Scottish nationalists are Fascist scum' Results show that the UKIP leader's image is appealing to the public. Tory council leader Keith Mitchell said Mr Farage 'uses soundbites that appeal to Conservatives' The poll found just 26 per cent said David Cameron was a good prime minister, a record low in ComRes studies, while 31 per cent believed Ed Miliband was performing well as Labour leader, a new high. The ComRes survey also revealed that 57 per cent of voters believed Mr Cameron's party was more divided over Europe than it was under Sir John Major, with 14 per cent disagreeing. But there was some comfort for the Prime Minister, with 49 per cent of voters saying the offer of a European referendum would be important to them at the next general election, with 27 per cent disagreeing. And 32 per cent believed Mr Cameron would make the best prime minister of the party leaders, with 24 per cent opting for Mr Miliband. Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) and PM David Cameron have had seen their support dwindle at the hands of UKIP . Labour former cabinet minister Lord Mandelson today attacked the 'UK isolation party' and the 'provisional wing' of the Conservatives for forcing Mr Cameron into making his referendum promise. He said leaving the EU would be a 'great setback economically for Britain' and warned that an in/out referendum would be a 'lottery' which could result in the UK severing ties with Brussels. He told the Andrew Marr Show: 'The UK isolation party and their fellow travellers in the Conservative Party are operating a Sopranos-style protection racket inside the Conservative Party.' Blast: Labour former cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called UKIP the 'UK isolation party' and said leaving the EU would be a 'great setback' for Britain . He added: 'They are saying do what we want, give us what we are demanding or we are going to burn your home down. 'In my view the Prime Minister has got to say enough is enough, you guys have got to clear off, take your tanks off my lawn, I am going to lead this party and govern this country in the way that serves its true economic national interest and I'm going to do so without being bullied around by a bunch of people whose only interest is to be separate from Europe but not to create the prosperity for Britain and the trade and other economic opportunities by staying within Europe and its single market.' He said Labour was right not to offer an in/out vote 'just for the sake of having a referendum'. On today’s Sunday Politics on BBC One, Conservative MP Nadine Dorries supports the idea of a Conservative / UKIP electoral deal. She said: 'Nick Boles suggested we should do this with the Liberal Democrats a year ago and he got promoted to be a minister, so I’m not sure why anybody thinks when I suggest it with UKIP that anything would happen other than that.  I’m looking forward to my promotion.' Conservative MP Jackie Doyle-Price told the programme: 'What I want to see is a Conservative majority government. But I think talking about a coalition with anyone is actually self-defeating in attaining that objective. 'We are representing a very proud party with a distinguished history and I find it really quite lily-livered if any Conservative Party should be opening talks about pacts at this stage.'","Support for the UK Independence Party has reached a record 19 per cent .

More money: Commons Speaker John Bercow (pictured with his wife Sally), who has backed pay rises for MPs, has taken a 1 per cent pay hike . MPs are in line for a dramatic salary rise of up to £20,000 in a move likely to reignite public fury over their pay and perks. They could take home up to £80,000 a year – more than three times the national average – under new recommendations. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which reports next month, has been looking at an increase of between £10,000 and £20,000. But the lower figure is considered more likely to try and minimise the public backlash, which would take MPs' pay, currently £65,738, up to £75,000. It comes as the Commons Speaker John Bercow, who has backed pay rises for MPs, has taken a 1 per cent pay hike taking his pay just above the Prime Minister’s £142,500 salary. The hike, which will probably be delayed until after 2015, will be partly offset by curbs to their gold-plated pensions and personal expenses. Ipsa, which was handed responsibility for MPs’ salaries and pensions two years ago in the wake of the expense scandal, has been carrying out a long review of MPs salaries. Its members believe salaries should be raised to bring politicians in line with senior civil servants and other professions. Mr Bercow said in 2009 that they should earn as much as a GP or a council boss, many of whom take home more than £100,000, as their jobs had ‘equal breadth, scope and contact with the public.’ He has recently taken a swipe at David Cameron, saying party leaders should not block pay rises to ‘appease the public’ and it was unfair on those politicians who are not independently wealthy. One senior MP told a newspaper yesterday he feared MPs would be ‘accused of having their snouts in the trough’. But he argued: ‘Voters may not like it, but if you pay peanuts you get monkeys.’ Taking the lead: Cabinet ministers including David Cameron are in a five-year pay freeze, saving the taxpayer £3million . But Labour MP John Mann, who opposes pay rises for MPs said: ‘They should throw this proposal in the bin, it will just create more bad publicity for MPs. It would be completely unacceptable, we are in the middle of a recession.’ Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Politicians shouldn't get huge pay hikes when taxpayers and other public sector workers are facing pay freezes and cuts. ‘MPs are already very well paid, and have other perks like gold-plated pensions that most taxpayers could never afford for themselves. 'There can't be one rule for MPs and another for the rest of the country. If politicians accept this rise it will send out completely the wrong message about pay restraint from the heart of Westminster.’ Ipsa is likely to demand that MPs give up their guaranteed pensions and switch to a less generous scheme. If so, most if not all of the pay rise, . will be needed to match their current pension deal, which is more . generous than for most of the public sector because MPs pay in for fewer . years before drawing a full pension and get a much larger contribution . from the taxpayer. 'They should throw this proposal in the bin, it will just create more bad publicity for MPs' Labour MP John Mann . Downing Street, which has no input into Ipsa’s proposals, is likely to be alarmed by the effect of the pay rise on their ‘all in this together’ message and the squeeze on public sector pay. Cabinet ministers including Mr Cameron are in a five-year pay freeze, saving the taxpayer £3million. None of the party leaders will be keen to annoy their backbenchers by breaking ranks and opposing, and it is understood they will discuss how to how to handle the potentially toxic announcement. In a recent consultation, a third of MPs told Ipsa they thought they pay should go up to £86,000 with some demanding more than £100,000. MPs pay has been frozen for two years but will rise by 1 per cent this year and next. Mr Bercow, MP for Buckingham has accepted the rise, taking his £142,162 deal up by £664, more than the Prime Minister and £8,000 more than a cabinet minister.","Ipsa reports next month and has been looking at rise of £10,000 to £20,000 .

After his sudden death from a perforated bowel a fortnight ago, Mr Bryan's son Nick set to work to give his father the send-off he desired. Family and friends wrote affectionate tributes to Tony Bryan on his coffin, which was built in the shape of a skip . Floral arrangements sat on top of the coffin, which toured Worcester before it was buried . Mourners lined up to add their messages to the casket, which was fastened on to Tony Bryan's work lorry . Dying wish: Tony Bryan had asked to be buried in a coffin shaped like a skip. His son described him as a real family man with a wicked sense of humour . He said: 'The funeral was a celebration of my father's life, not a mourning of his passing. 'That's what he wanted, and I'm not one to mope about anyway. 'A couple of days after his death we felt quite empty and down, but building the skip really took my mind off things.' More than 150 mourners attended Mr Bryan's funeral service at the Masonic Hall in Worcester on Thursday before his lorry toured the town, taking in the house where he was born, his favourite pubs, and buildings he had worked on. He was then buried in his one-acre back garden, where he used to enjoy making things out of scrap.

Jackie, who won the public vote in a heat of the contest, impressed a panel of . judges to become the first transgender teenager to go through to the Miss . England semi-final. The teen, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: ‘I’m ecstatic to get through, I never expected it. ‘It’s been lovely to see the support from everyone and I have had so many . people contacting me saying they hope I win. ‘I have come this far and now I am in it to win it. ‘Lots of people have been in touch and it makes me blush to think I have . inspired others. I never thought I would be able to inspire anyone.’ Mother Susie, 43, said: ‘I’m really proud of her. She’s been through an awful lot but she has chosen to put herself out there and at risk. ‘There is a lot of prejudice out there but she is trying to make people understand this isn’t a choice and it can be OK.’ Miss England semi-finals will be held later this month. Teenage dreams: Jackie Green, pictured on TV show Lorraine Live today, hopes to be crowned Miss England just two years after she underwent a full sex change operation . Rivals: Green, who is set to win Miss England, is pictured, far right, at the Miss Model Zed competition . Jackie's life turned from one of misery to the happy girl she is today after the sex change. At her lowest point, the teenager even threatened to cut off her own genitals with a knife. She underwent a seven-hour sex change operation in Thailand, where under 18s can have the surgery, two years ago. After years of bullying and torment, she now claims to lead a normal life and has a boyfriend. Now she hopes to work as a model. She said: 'It’s a little strange because there are so many other really gorgeous girls in the competition. 'It would be amazing to win and I just hope it makes other people see that there is a lot more to life than getting bullied.' New life: Jackie Green was the youngest person in Britain to undergo a sex change two years ago . Prayers answered: Jackie, pictured just before surgery, had her operation on her 16th birthday in Thailand . When she was Jack: Jackie, pictured with her mother Susie (left) , knew she was a girl trapped in a boy's body from an early age. She now dreams of following in the footsteps of Miss England 2011 Alize Mounter (right) She added: 'When I was younger I never really . had anyone else to look up to in the same position. I would have never . imagined this, not in a million years.' Her supportive mother Susie added: 'If she went on to win I would be very proud of her. 'She has stuck herself out there and knew she would get flak for it. Some comments on websites haven’t . been very kind but she is aware of that and thinks why should that stop . me, I’m the same as anyone else.' A spokesman for the competition said: 'There's not much we could do legally to stop her entering. 'We did agonise over it, but as she is a woman she fits the bill and is an affable young lady.' Jackie Green formerly Jack who had a sex change for her sixteenth birthday with proud mum Susie . Contender: Weightlifter Sarah Davies has won Miss Leads . A stunning weightlifter has turned Miss England hopeful after combining beauty and brawn. Sarah Davies, 19, is the current British Universities weightlifting champion - just five months after taking up the sport. But now, after being persuaded to enter the beauty pageant while working in a bar, Sarah is on the verge of being crowned Miss England. The Leeds Metropolitan student, from Bilsborrow, Lancashire, said: ‘I wanted to show that it is possible to be fit and healthy while still be glamorous. ‘At the regional heats, I think the judges thought the weightlifting was something a bit different. ‘But I still couldn’t quite believe it when they announced I’d won Miss Leeds and would be going to the finals.’ Sarah wowed judges with her lifting skills - defeating more than 200 applicants to bag a place in the finals, set to be held in Leicester on June 26. The teenage beauty, who is training to be a PE teacher, added: ‘I work in a bar on Saturday nights and they were coming round asking for people to enter. ‘I did it for a laugh really, I have no ambitions to be a model - and when I saw all these tall leggy blondes at the auditions I didn’t think I’d have any chance. ‘I’ve never been interested in being a model and have had my heart set on being a PE teacher, but it is all good fun and I’ll take it in my stride.’ If things don’t work out, Sarah may still have a career in sport, having set her sights on a place on the GB weightlifting squad for the Commonwealth games. Sarah, who lifts at the 63kg weight after being introduced to the sport by her boyfriend, is already tipped as a future world champion after a whirlwind rise in the sport. A spokeswoman for Miss England said: ‘We have had an eclectic mix of contestants this year - from a busker to a footballer. ‘We hope it represents our nation in its diversity and talent. ‘Sarah will be one of 60 national finalists competing for the Miss England title in Leicester in June. ‘The finalists will compete in a boot camp, front top model, fundraising and interview rounds as part of the contest. ‘The winner receives £25,000 and a place in Miss World, where the winner gets $100,000 and a trip to Mauritius to promote the shopping fiesta at the end of June.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.",Jackie Green - formerly Jack - underwent surgery to become a woman in Thailand on her 16th birthday .

The grief-stricken parents of a five-year-old girl who drowned in Egypt were flying home last night as a row intensified over who was to blame for her death. Chloe Johnson was reportedly left by a shallow toddler pool in Sharm el-Sheikh for a few minutes while her parents fetched her a drink. She drowned in another pool with a wave machine, which her parents, Sarah Thompson and Tony Johnson, say was not manned by lifeguards. Tragic: Chloe Johnson died in a hotel wave pool when her parents left to fetch a drink . Anger: Chloe's parents have expressed their anger at the lack of lifeguards at the hotel . Miss Thompson, 32, told a Sunday newspaper: ‘She was playing with her little friend. I explained to her twice, called her, told her exactly where we were before we went to get a drink. ‘She went to the wave pool, which was supposed to be manned by two lifeguards, but there were none there. I was walking around with her drink… looking for her, calling for her… The pool wasn’t monitored while there were waves going on.’ But Egyptian prosecutors said safety instructions at the hotel state that ‘children five years old and under must only use the pool under the supervision of their  relatives’. They confirmed the couple had told police that a lifeguard was neglectful and had accused him of being the ‘cause of their daughter’s death’. Devastated: Chloe's grandparents spoke of their loss shortly after  her death . Heartbroken: They spoke of their anger at the lack of help the family received in Sharm el Sheik . They said the family did not come forward to be formally interviewed, meaning investigators had to rely solely on accounts given by lifeguards and the hotel. It is not clear whether the couple were aware they had to make an official report. Maged Ramzy, of Sharm el-Sheikh Prosecution Office said a lifeguard accused of neglecting the young girl was released yesterday, while an investigation is carried out. Miss Thompson, of Forest Hill, south London, paid tribute to her ‘cheeky, beautiful, vibrant’ daughter, who survived open heart surgery at two days old and was on her first holiday abroad. She said: ‘I am just empty without her.’ Probe: First Choice said it would carry out a 'full and thorough investigation' in partnership with the hotelier . Heartache: The youngster died in a pool at the Coral Sea Waterworld hotel. File picture. The distraught mother said staff at the Coral Sea Waterworld hotel initially did nothing to try to revive Chloe, leaving her father to attempt mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as they waited for emergency services. Mr Ramzy added: ‘According to the prosecution’s investigations, the father was with her in the pool when she [was found] drowned and the lifeguards arrived to her within five seconds.’ Egypt’s Chamber of Diving and Watersports is investigating whether safety instructions were shown clearly and whether the lifeguard was to blame or not. Grandparents April and Gordon Johnson, said the family felt ‘angry and so hurt’.","Chloe Johnson was reportedly left by a shallow toddler pool .

Socialist Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has said multi-millionaire footballers playing in France will not be exempt from the super tax . Multi-millionaire footballers playing in France will not be exempt from the country's 75 per cent super tax, Socialist Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault confirmed today. The announcement will be a huge blow to clubs like Paris St Germain, who have signed up some of the richest players in the world, including former England captain David Beckham. The former England captain lives in a . Paris hotel and has left his family back in London, which technically . means he may be able to avoid paying French taxes on his fortune, which . is estimated at around £200million. But Mr Ayrault has made it clear he . wants multi-millionaire sportsmen like Beckham to donate huge . proportions of their wealth to his administration. 'All companies that pay wages above one million' will be affected by the proposed new tax, said Mr Ayrault. It follows Noel Le Graet, president of the French Football Federation, claiming he had received 'assurances' that 'only big companies will be taxed' and that football clubs are considered 'small' companies. In fact Paris St Germain is currently the richest club in the world, having been bought by sheiks from oil-rich Qatar. Its wage bill is enormous, although Beckham claims that he is virtually working for free, and intends to donate his salary to charity. A government spokesman confirmed: 'The new measure will apply to all companies paying out salaries above 1 million euros.' There has been huge opposition from France's rich to the tax, which President Francois Hollande first unveiled during his election campaign last year. Noel Le Graet, (left) president of the French Football Federation, claimed he had been given assurances that football clubs are considered small companies but in fact Paris St Germain, which David Beckham (right) plays for, is the richest club in the world . Rich businessmen and celebrities have been flooding out of Paris since Mr Hollande came to power.

A fugitive charged with abducting and sexually assaulting a 10-year-old Los Angeles girl was returned to the U.S. today after authorities arrested him in a Mexican village where he'd checked himself into a rehabilitation facility under a fake name. Tobias Summers, 30, was being brought to Los Angeles to face 37 felony charges, including numerous sexual assault counts, FBI Special Agent in Charge Tim Delaney said. Summers has been on the run for nearly a month. Police Chief Charlie Beck credited a $25,000 FBI reward that was highly publicized south of the border for a phone tip late on Tuesday that led to Summers' arrest on Wednesday morning. 'Anybody in this city who thinks they can commit that kind of crime and remain free after doing so ... we'll hunt you, we'll find you, you cannot hide,' Beck said. Caught: Tobias Summers, pictured, accused kidnapper and child molester, was arrested in Mexico on April 24, 2013 . Mexican authorities acted on the tip received by the FBI and tracked Summers to a drug and alcohol treatment facility in a tiny village on the coast between Tijuana and Ensenada, according to Alfredo Arenas, international liaison for the Baja California state police. Summers checked into the facility under a false name, but police identified him from a Superman logo tattooed on his chest, Arenas said. He was arrested without struggle. 'He was pretty scared,' Arenas said. 'We had him in custody very fast.' The victim's parents discovered she was missing from her bedroom in her Northridge home in the early morning hours of March 27. She was found about 12 hours later wandering near a Starbucks several miles away. Authorities soon arrested Daniel Martinez, 29, as a suspected accomplice and later revealed that Summers had been spotted in a video recording as he crossed the border into Mexico at Tecate, east of San Diego. Tip: Mexican authorities acted on the tip received by the FBI and tracked Summers, pictured left and right, to a drug and alcohol treatment facility in a tiny village on the coast between Tijuana and Ensenada . Authorities believe Summers broke into the girl's home planning to burglarize it but instead abducted her at knifepoint. They believe Martinez was waiting outside in a car the two used to flee with the girl. Martinez soon abandoned the car and vanished, police have said, while Summers took the girl to a vacant home where he assaulted her. FBI Special Agent Scott Garriola wrote in an affidavit that the girl was taken to several locations and raped. While he was a fugitive, Summers was charged by Los Angeles County prosecutors with kidnapping, burglary and nearly three dozen counts of sexual assault. Summers was described as a transient with a criminal record including convictions for burglary and grand theft. Detectives identified him as a suspect based on evidence at a crime scene, the victim's descriptions and others. Four days after the abduction, LAPD detectives were told that Summers may be in the San Diego area. In an interview with a friend of Summers, detectives learned he had been thinking of going to Tijuana, Mexico. Arrest: Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, left to right, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck, and FBI Special Agent in Charge Tim Delaney, announced the arrest on Wednesday . Video showed Summers crossing the border into Tecate, Mexico, three days after the abduction. 'This entry into Mexico occurred within several hours of Summers being identified in the media as the person responsible for the kidnapping,' a federal complaint stated. On Wednesday, the FBI website showed pictures of Summers and his tattoos with the word 'captured' across the bottom of each photo. Mexican authorities had distributed 'wanted' posters with Summers' picture and put police in the cities of Tecate, Ensenada and Rosarito Beach on alert. Summers has a criminal record dating to 2002 that includes arrests for robbery, battery and grand theft auto. Court records show Martinez has been convicted of burglary and grand theft. He has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping and burglary. Summers was charged early this month with kidnapping, burglary and nearly three dozen counts of sexual assault. If convicted, he faces multiple life terms in prison. Captured: Daniel Martinez, left, was captured for his involvement in the kidnap about a month ago but Tobias Summers, right, was still at large until Wednesday . His alleged accomplice, Martinez, was also charged in the kidnapping having been arrested almost a month ago. According to police, Summers broke into victim's house in the middle of the night on March 27 while Martinez waited in a getaway car. Summers emerged from the home with the girl and they both got in the car. Martinez drove a short distance and then abandoned the vehicle and disappeared. Summers took the girl to a vacant home nearby where he held her captive, police said. At some point, according to a criminal complaint, Summers sexually assaulted her and forced her to pose for nude photos. The girl turned up about 12 hours later after the harrowing ordeal, disoriented and disheveled. Police Cmdr. Andrew Smith said it was unclear why Summers abducted the girl but investigators don't believe he had targeted her when he initially went to the home. Martinez was charged with one count each of kidnapping and burglary. He faces a maximum 12-year prison term if found guilty. The girl was snatched from her bedroom and was found wandering near a Starbucks about six miles away. She was barefoot, had bruises and scratches, and wasn't wearing the same clothes she had on when she vanished. Both men have had problems with law enforcement in the past. Summers has a criminal record dating back to 2002 that includes arrests for robbery, battery and grand theft auto. Court records show Martinez has been convicted of burglary and grand theft. Police have received more than 130 tips in recent days regarding Summers, who fled to Mexico hours after he was identified as a suspect.","Tobias Summers, 30, was being brought to Los Angeles to face 37 felony charges, including numerous sexual assault counts for the March 27 incident .

"By . Alex Ward . PUBLISHED: . 10:32 EST, 20 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:55 EST, 20 May 2013 . Jailed: Retired CoE priest Canon Gordon Rideout has been found guilty of a catalogue of historic sex attacks on young children at a Barnardo's home . A retired Church of England priest found guilty of a catalogue of historic sex attacks on young children at a Barnardo's home has been jailed for 10 years. Canon Gordon Rideout, 74, abused more than a dozen girls and boys at the now closed home at Ifield Hall in Crawley, West Sussex, over a four-year period. The former Anglican clergyman from Polegate, East Sussex, also indecently assaulted two girls at an army site in Middle Wallop, Hampshire, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. At Lewes Crown Court, Rideout was found guilty of 34 counts of indecent assault and two counts of attempted rape on 16 children between January 1962 and January 1973. He was cleared of one count of indecent assault on a boy at a second Barnardo's home in Essex. As he was sentenced today, the Bishop of Chichester, Dr Martin Warner, said Rideout had caused ‘immeasurable and destructive suffering’ over a long period of time. Most of the charges he was convicted of related to his time as an assistant curate at St Mary's Church in Crawley when he would visit a Barnardo's children's home in the county. Prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC told the jury that Rideout would visit the home and ‘it would appear from the evidence that he would wander the house and indeed the grounds unaccompanied, and he would visit children when they were sick and alone in bed’. One of his victims recalled Rideout visiting the dormitories at night, put his hands under the covers and ‘fondle around’. Mr Bennetts said: ‘It was on a regular basis when he came to stay, maybe once, twice, three times a week sometimes.’ Rideout's victims did not complain at the time for fear of not being believed. Jurors heard how Rideout attempted to rape a girl who attended choir practice. After one occasion in his flat, Rideout walked the girl back to the children's home and told her: ‘This is going to be our secret.’ A month after another rape attempt in a wooded area, the girl believed she was pregnant. When she confided the abuse to a friend who went on to tell a manager at the home, the victim was slapped across her face. At the home, Mr Bennetts said there was a ‘brutal regime where children were taught how to behave by beatings’. One girl, who was aged around 14 or 15 at the time she was abused, was asked why she had not reported it to the authorities sooner. She told police in interview: ‘I was too scared, too scared.I didn't want to be beaten again, too scared. The beatings were so much worse than what that man was doing. The beatings were terrible, absolutely terrible.’ One boy asked Rideout why he was molesting him. Rideout replied: ‘I've got to do it.’ When the boy went on to question him why, Rideout said: ‘I like little boys.’ Another complainant said she told the married couple who ran the home that the priest was abusing them, but they responded by throwing her against a wall, breaking one of her ribs. Caused 'immeasurable suffering': Rideout was sentenced 10 years jail at Lewes Crown Court (pictured) after he abused more than a dozen girls and boys at the now closed home at Ifield Hall in West Sussex, over a four-year period . Rideout was arrested in March last . year and charged five months later following a nine-month inquiry by . Sussex Police. He denied all the charges. Barnardo's . director of children's services Sam Monaghan said after the case: ‘We . are extremely saddened by this case and our deepest sympathies go out to . those who have suffered. It has taken great courage for them to step . forward and relive their experiences. ‘We are glad that justice has been served and believe it is critical that abusers are held to account for their crimes, regardless of when they took place. We take all allegations of historical abuse extremely seriously and we will always co-operate fully with the justice system on such matters.’ Rideout is the latest figure from the scandal-hit diocese of Chichester to be convicted of historic sex crimes against children. Earlier this month a report was published into the operation of child protection policies in the diocese two years after the former archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams ordered a visitation. It followed a series of scandals involving clergymen within the diocese which has led to several being arrested, charged and convicted for historical sex crimes against children. Abuse during visits: Most of the charges Rideout was convicted of relate to his time working at St Mary's Church when he'd visit a Barnardo's home . The report's publication prompted a renewed apology from the current Archbishop, Dr Justin Welby, who said the Anglican church can never ignore the ‘hurt and damage’ of victims who should ‘never have been let down’ by people who should have been trusted. Investigations into Rideout began after police were handed a confidential report by Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss in May 2011 raising concerns about his conduct in the 1960s and early 1970s. Another priest referred to in the report, Robert Coles, 71, of Eastbourne, was jailed for eight years in February for sex offences against young boys. His offending was not linked to Rideout. Following the case, the Bishop of Chichester, Dr Martin Warner, said: ‘Gordon Rideout has been the cause of immeasurable and destructive suffering over a long period of time. He has also betrayed the trust and respect of many who have valued his ministry. Today's verdict will have repercussions in many different ways across Sussex and beyond. ‘We are left with the question of why it has taken so long for these grave accusations to be taken seriously and brought to trial. What lessons do we all have to learn from this terrible catalogue of abuse about the strength and effectiveness of our communication within and between agencies that have responsibility for the safeguarding of children and vulnerable adults? Scandal-hit diocese: After the former Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams (left) ordered a visitation, a report into child protection in the Chichester diocese was published, prompting current Archbishop Dr Justin Welby (right) renewing an apology to victims . ‘In the diocese of Chichester we shall continue to interrogate those procedures and to do our very best to ensure that we deliver the quality and standard that others expect of us.’ Nigel Pilkington, head of the CPS South East Complex Casework Unit, said: ‘As an assistant curate and then chaplain, Gordon Rideout was in a position of trust, which he systemically abused, indecently assaulting the vulnerable youngsters that he met over a number of years. ‘A number of his victims attempted to speak out about what Rideout was doing, but tragically at the time of the offences, a child's word was not believed. ‘Those who were brave enough to say anything were subjected to brutal beatings. Some of his victims told police in interviews that it simply “wasn't worth complaining” because of the punishment they would receive in return. 'They may not have been believed as children, but today they finally have been. I hope that helps to give them closure. Bishop of Chichester, Dr Martin Warner . Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS South East, Roger Coe-Salazar, said: ‘This case is an example of how the CPS successfully prosecutes cases of child sexual abuse and should serve as a warning to those who think they can abuse children with impunity. ‘We are exceptionally mindful of how difficult it can be for victims to step forward and place their trust in the authorities many years later, but I hope this case illustrates the support and understanding they will receive from the prosecutors and the police when they do.’ Police said none of the charges Rideout faced related to claims of recent or current offending and there is no suggestion that any children are currently at risk. Detective Chief Inspector Jon Gross, of Sussex Police, said: ‘It is difficult to overestimate the significance of this verdict for those who have finally seen justice, many decades after being prey to the sexual abuse perpetrated by Gordon Rideout. ‘His offending over that period has been hugely impactive upon the lives of his victims, from childhood to the present day. ‘It is hoped this case will bring a sense of closure to all of those who provided evidence to the investigation while underlining to the wider community that it is never too late to report serious crimes, however long ago the alleged offending took place. ‘In carrying out this investigation we also received full co-operation from the Diocese of Chichester and Barnardo's Homes.’","Canon Gordon Rideout, 74, was sentenced to ten years in jail .

A brave mother-of-five has told how needing 1,000 stitches to horrific injuries suffered in the catastrophic blast at a Texas fertilizer plant is 'another bump in the road' for her. Positive Misty Lambert, 37, had only moved to West, near Waco, Texas, two weeks before the devastating explosion last Wednesday which killed at least 14 and injured more than 200 others. She was left in agony suffering cuts to her face, chest and arms caused by flying shards of glass and metal and was knocked to the ground by a falling window. Positive: Misty Lambert, 37, who was injured in last week's Texas fertilizer factory blast has described her injuries as 'another bump in the road' Bearing the scars: Ms Lambert needed 1,000 stitches after she was caught up in the blast near her home in West, Texas . Ms Lambert was trapped in her apartment close to the West Fertilizer Co. plant for an hour before she was rescued by emergency crews. She has been left with scars all over her face and body. She told KWTX-TV: 'It's another bump in the road for me. I'm saddened by the fact that people lost their lives, but I'm grateful that I still have my life.' Emergency crews worked frantically in the wake of the explosion to find survivors in West, much of which was flattened by the blast. Among the dead are six firefighters and four paramedics. Ms Lambert says that she was in the bedroom of her apartment when she spotted the factory on fire. Worrying that the fire might spread or the factory explode, Ms Lambert told her four-year-old son Nikoda and two of her nephews to leave the room and head to door. Catastrophic: At least 14 people were killed in the deadly explosion which rocked the fertilizer plant last Wednesday . Devastated: The huge explosion, the worst industrial disaster in the US for three years, flattened large parts of West . She grabbed her keys and her phone and was about to flee the flat when she turned back to look out of the window. She said: The explosion itself, it just came at me.' State investigators are still working to piece together what caused the fire and subsequent explosion at the plant. They say that so far there are no signs that there was any criminal intent behind the tragedy. But it emerged yesterday that the plant last had a full safety inspection almost 30 years ago. The United States Department of Labor website said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) visited West Chemical and Fertilizer Company in February 1985. The revelation came amid growing concern about how health and safety rules were followed at the plant, which supplied agricultural chemicals and fertilizer to area farmers. Back then it fined the company $30 for a serious violation for storage of anhydrous ammonia. Destroyed: An aerial shot shows the extent of the damage caused by the huge blast . OSHA cited the plant for four other serious violations of respiratory protection standards but did not issue fines. The maximum fine for a serious violation was $1,000. The agency has jurisdiction over more than 7million workplaces but it is not uncommon for some companies to go years without inspection. The towns schools reopened on Monday and families of those who died have begun to plan funerals. But those living closest to the factory have not yet been allowed to return to their homes. Owner of the factory Donald Adair issued a statement on Friday saying that he would co-operate fully with the investigation into the blast.","Misty Lambert needed 1,000 stitches after the explosion near Waco .

'Bitterly disappointed': Sir Peregrine Worthstone has called his brother-in-law 'cruel and selfish' He said: 'Having backed the  hereditary aristocracy all my writing life as a journalist, I feel bitterly  disappointed by my brother-in-law's cruel and selfish behaviour towards his sisters. 'Three of them have no money at all and he is spending fortunes.' Family ties: Sir Peregrine's wife Lady Lucinda Lambton . Ned has five sisters, and three of them – including Lucinda – are suing him for their share of the £12 million fortune. Sir Peregrine added: 'He inherited the estate but the normal thing is to share out some of the booty, so to speak, with your siblings.' The legal battle has been taken to Italy where the Earl died at the age of 84 in his 400-year-old baroque pile, Villa Cetinale. Sir Peregrine, 89, added: 'The whole thing rests on the fact that my father-in-law died in Italian  domicile – which means that, by Italian law, everything should be divided between  his children. 'The sisters took it for granted that they would get their share. And Ned always said he would do something about it but never did. There is nothing to explain his behaviour.'

She has been named as a suspect in a corruption case involving him . The King of Spain's youngest daughter has been named as a suspect in a 5 million Euro corruption scandal. Princess Cristina, 47 - one of King Juan Carlos's three children - will be called in for questioning later this month, a court in Palma de Mallorca has announced. She will be quizzed over claims her husband Inaki Urdangarin, 45, and his former business partner Diego Torres, 47, embezzled cash from public funds. The duo are accused of siphoning off the money, from their supposedly non-profit Nóos Institute - of which Princess Cristina was a board member - to their own coffers. Prosecutors claim the pair used Urdangarin’s powerful connections to win public contracts, and then over-charged councils for the sports events they organised. Urdangarin was chairman of the charitable body between 2004 and 2006. An official investigation was launched into the alleged fraud, which both men deny and have yet to be charged, last year. There had never been any suggestion that mother-of-four Cristina, who is seventh in line to the throne, was involved. But yesterday a shadow was cast over the Royal family after emails between the Princess and former Olympic handball star Urdangarin, whom she married in 1997, were leaked to Judge Jose Castro by Torres. Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that Urdangarin sent her one email, dated February 20, 2003, which asked her to look over a message to 'contributors, clients and friends' that he intended to send out on behalf of the Institute. The following day, he allegedly sent out the same email to a wider range of recipients - including Queen Sofia and King Juan Carlos - where he also asked for advice on what he was writing. While the emails alone do not prove the Princess was involved, Castro is believed to want to grill her in more detail on the issue. Allegations: The investigation into Mr Urdangarin's business dealings has caused embarrassment for the Spanish Royal Family. He is pictured here with Princess Cristina and King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia . The judge recently set joint bail of 8.2 . million euros for Mr Urdangarin and Mr Torres and said the two 'ignored . the rules of public contracting as long as they achieved their aim, . which was no other than to divert public funds for their own benefit or . that of others.' He said the two agreed to make as . much as possible out of Mr Urdangarin's relationship with the Royal . Palace in their dealings with public and private entities. Mr . Urdangarin, 45, comes from a wealthy Basque family but is not nobility; he became Duke . of Palma because Cristina is Duchess of Palma. The couple have four . children. Princess Cristina is the youngest of the king's two daughters . and the middle of his three children. The royal family decided last year to sideline Mr Urdangarin from all official royal activities, and recently removed him from the family website. Cristina is the youngest of the . King’s two daughters, behind Princess Elena, 49 . The King and wife . Sofia also have a son, Prince Felipe, 45, who is heir to the throne. The royal household has refused to . comment on the news, which comes as polls suggest support for the . monarchy has fallen to a record low of 54 per cent. It also follows the revelation that . Juan Carlos, 75, received a 2.2million Euro inheritance, deposited in . three Swiss bank accounts, when his father Juan died on April 1, 1993. Questions are now being asked as to . whether the King, under fire for going elephant-hunting in Africa last . year as recession continues to bite, paid the correct amount of tax on . the sum. The trip to Botswana only came to light after he fell and broke his hip, but sparked anger among Spain’s 5 million unemployed. It also cost him his role as honorary . president of the Spanish branch of the World Wildlife Fund and saw him . issue an unprecedented apology. It is in stark contrast to a decade ago when Juan Carlos was left virtually untouched by the media. He was held in great respect for his . role in brokering the transition from dictatorship to democracy . following the death of General Franco in 1975.","Princess Cristina, 47, to be called in for questioning later this month .

Split: Actor Robson Green has spoken for the first time about the breakdown in his marriage to former Page 3 model Vanya Seager, revealing that the pair haven't spoken for two years. The couple are pictured in 2000 . Actor Robson Green has spoken for the first time about the breakdown in his marriage to former Page 3 model Vanya Seager, revealing that the pair haven’t spoken for two years. Instead the couple – who have been married for 12 years and have a 13-year-old son, Taylor – communicate only by text messages. ‘I haven’t talked to her since we parted,’ said the 48-year-old former Soldier Soldier star. ‘We are in touch. But we don’t speak. We communicate by text. It’s nice and safe that way. And that’s what Taylor needs. ‘I don’t know why Vanya decided it’s better not to speak but, that’s what she has decided. It wasn’t my decision,’ he said. ‘It wasn’t me that wanted to do that. She decided. Frankly, I’m not sure how she perceives me now.’ The collapse of Robson’s second marriage is clearly a painful subject for the Geordie star, who found fame in the 1990s ITV Army drama and had a No 1 hit singing Unchained Melody with co-star Jerome Flynn. His first marriage to occupational therapist Alison Ogilvie ended in 1999 after he had conducted a four-year clandestine affair with Pamela McDonald, the then wife of Emmerdale actor, Ian Sharrock.Robson is unwilling to lay the blame for his latest split at Vanya’s door. ‘Vanya is a lady,’ he said,  ‘She’s a great person. Just not great for me.’ He also does not blame his work schedule – which has included travelling abroad to film five series of Extreme Fishing and two of Extreme Fishing Challenge. ‘No, that wasn’t the reason,’ he said. ‘OK, maybe it is being away all the time, maybe it’s not being the greatest husband in the world, but by default that does not make you a bad father. But I try to keep my side of the street clean and I am a good dad. ‘You get to the point where you may be great as individuals but you’re not great for one another,’ he said. ‘I’ve had to explain that to Taylor. 'Vanya and I just grew apart. I don’t blame it on the career. It’s just we were different and we didn’t develop together. My mind went in one direction, hers in the other.’ While the end of his marriage is clearly a source of much soul searching for Robson, it is the separation from his son that causes him most turmoil. ‘Vanya and Taylor live in the South East now,’ said Robson, who still lives in Hexham, Northumberland – the small market town where he was born. Separation: Vanya Seager is pictured modelling in 1978. She has been married to Green for 12 years . ‘Taylor and I talk all the time but I . don’t see enough of him. The most important thing about the separation . is not its effect on me or Vanya, it’s about how Taylor is developing. And right now he is developing into the most wonderful, creative, . ambitious, competent young man.’ Robson is the Northern lad personified: from mining stock, his love for his native Northumberland is embedded deep in his DNA. His early life was impoverished. He spent three years as an apprentice draughtsman at Swan Hunter shipyard on the Tyneside but, smitten by the smell of greasepaint at his local amateur dramatics club, he was desperate to take to the stage full time. Telling his late father (also called Robson) that he wanted to leave the shipyard and become a professional actor was a daunting prospect. ‘I loved him but I was scared to tell him how I really felt,’ he recalled. ‘When I told him he said, “What do you mean you want to be an actor? Do you know what you are doing? You’re being paid a fortune at the yard, do you know how hard it is to get a job?” Then there was a lot of swearing. ‘I could understand his thinking. He was a big guy with hands like shovels, working in the most dangerous occupation in the world. Then I tell him I want to put on make-up and ponce about in front of a camera.’ It was Robson’s attachment to his beloved North East that, in part, may have sparked the first warning signs that his marriage to Hong Kong-born Vanya was on the rocks. Stars: Robson Green and Jerome Flynn are pictured in TV show Soldier Soldier . ‘She never warmed to the North East, that’s the truth,’ he said. ‘She is this kind of oriental flower. She came up here and her hair would straighten in the Northern damp. But that’s not the reason we grew apart. Nothing to do with the hair,’ he laughs. The pair met when Vanya was working as Simon Cowell’s secretary. ‘I went to his office with Jerome and there she was, the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen.’ The ten-year age gap (Vanya is now 58) meant nothing to him. When she became pregnant with Taylor, the pair decided to marry. Vanya had, in fact, been dating Cowell. Though Cowell described her at the time as ‘too possessive’ it was rumoured he was heart-broken when she left him for Robson. In fact it was a double blow for Cowell who had just signed Robson to his then label, RAC, and made him an international star with Flynn. It is now his TV fishing shows that are Robson’s first love. His Extreme series have taken him to more than 90 countries but it nearly cost him his life when he and his crew went overboard off the Cape of Storms in Canada. ‘I thought I was going to die. And I remember thinking, “I don’t want anyone else to be Taylor’s dad. I’m his dad.” ’","Actor and Vanya Seager now communicate only by text messages .

Crime scene: Thieves are thought to have broken into the Lord Mayor's Mansion House through the basement overnight on Monday . Thieves are thought to have broken in through the cellar of the house overnight between Monday and Tuesday. Among the other items stolen were silver cups dating back to 1919, a set of four Victorian star-embossed napkin rings from 1875, a William IV snuff box from 1834, a George II mustard pot from 1759 and a Queen Anne silver love cup embossed with her coat of arms. Newcastle Temporary Superintendent Bruce Storey said: 'Some of the items taken in this burglary are very uncommon and we are asking the public to keep their eyes open for them. 'The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded 93 times to 124 Nobel Laureates between 1901 and 2012 and so the stolen item is extremely rare, recognisable and historically important.' Arthur Henderson's Nobel Prize is . engraved with the words 'Parlimentum Norvegial A Munro Henderson' and is . in a leather display case. It was awarded in 1934, just a year before Henderson's death. Among . his attempts to prevent declining diplomatic relations, Henderson . established links with the newly formed Soviet Union, entered Britain . into the League of Nations and chaired the Geneva Disarmament Conference . between 1932 and 1934. Historic: The Mansion House is available for hire as a wedding venue these days . Unfortunately, . the conference was beset by disagreements, including what constituted . 'offensive' and 'defensive' weapons and talks broke down when Adolf . Hitler withdrew Germany from the meeting and the League of Nations. The . citation for Henderson's award says that he was 'among the bravest and . most faithful' in his efforts to calm international tensions. It praises his 'tact and unfailing courtesy and prudent reserve' and his 'indestructible endurance and never-ending patience.' Admiral Lord Collingwood is much celebrated in his native North East for his long career at sea and a monument was erected in his memory at Tynemouth. Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson, right, pictured talking to new Prime Minister Ramsey Macdonald as the new cabinet prepares for a photo in 1929 . Born from humble origins - he was the illegitimate son of a manual worker - Arthur Henderson was born in Glasgow on September 13 1863. His father died when Henderson was young and when his mother remarried when he was nine, the family moved to Newcastle. At the age of 12, Henderson took a job as an iron moulder and soon became involved with trade unions. He was one of the 129 delegates to found the forerunner of the Labour Party in 1900 and elected as the party's fourth MP in Barnard Castle in 1903. By 1908, Henderson had become the leader of the Labour Party and made history seven years later when he became the first Labour Cabinet Minister in the wartime coalition government. He was Home Secretary in the first Labour Government formed in 1922 and became Foreign Secretary under Ramsey Macdonald in 1929. He spent the latter part of his career trying to defuse diplomatic tensions that were escalating prior to the start of the Second World War in 1939, holding talks with Germany. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his efforts in 1934. But Henderson never lived to see peacekeeping efforts fail as he died a year later in 1935.","The prize was awarded to former Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson .

Hacking away: The two viruses - SpyEye and Zeus - are able to take up to £10,500 at a time from a bank account . Two new viruses can steal money from bank accounts and can do so automatically - without any hacker's supervision, researchers said. The latest variants of the widespread SpyEye and Zeus programs have already stolen as much as 13,000EU (around £10,500) at a time from a single account and are in the early stages of deployment, according to investigators at Trend Micro, a Japan-based security company that has many banks as customers. Trend Micro Vice President Tom Kellerman said his company's researchers had seen the new attacks on a dozen financial institutions in Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy. European banks generally have greater . technology defenses than those in the United States, and Kellerman said . it is 'inevitable' that the variants will cross the Atlantic. The . new code has the potential to dramatically escalate the amount being . stolen from accounts and a years-old arms race between the banks and . criminal groups that are often based in Eastern Europe. Kellerman said: 'This has tremendous implications. This attack toolkit ushers in a new era of bank heists.' Like . other security companies, Trend Micro profits by selling software and . services to institutions and consumers worried about online spying and . account takeovers. Though . written and controlled by different groups, SpyEye and Zeus share the . ability to be installed on computers that visit malicious websites or . legitimate pages that have been compromised by hackers. Both . programs are sold in the burgeoning underground hacking economy, where . they can be customised or improved with additional modules like those . just discovered. The . programs already have used a technique called 'web injection' to . generate new entry fields when victims log on to any number of banks or . other sensitive websites. Instead of seeing a bank ask for an account number and password, for example, a victimised user sees requests for both of those and an ATM card number. Everything typed in then gets whisked off to the hacker, who later signs in and transfers money to an accomplice's account. Those transfers can be time-consuming, and the hacker has to think about how much can be sent out at once without drawing attention. Multiple, smaller transfers are preferable but take more time. For the past year or more, some variants have also captured one-time passwords sent from the banks by text messages to client cell phones as an added security measure. But in those cases, a hacker had to be online within 30 or 60 seconds in order to use the one-time password. Kellerman said the new software costs between $300 and $4,000 on top of basic thieving tools . The new software allows the criminal to siphon money out while he sleeps. It could significantly increase the number of hacked accounts and the speed with which they are drained. Brett Stone-Gross, a senior security researcher with Dell Inc unit Dell SecureWorks, said thieves 'will be able to extract more money' with automation. But he also said the landscape might not be transformed by the development, because the main limiting factor for crime groups is the number of accomplices, known as money mules, that they can hire to accept transfers from victim accounts. Automation will not lessen the need for mules, Stone-Gross said. Trend Micro spoke online with sellers of the automated transfer modules who were based in Russia, Ukraine and Romania, where arrests and prosecutions are rare. Kellerman said the new software costs between $300 and $4,000 on top of the basic thieving tools, with customized jobs costing still more.

Banks generally make individuals whole for such losses if they are detected quickly. But recent versions of SpyEye and Zeus can present fake account balances to individual bank customers, so they might not realize their savings are being drained until too late. Kellerman recommended that banks move more toward 'out-of-band' authentication, such as direct phone calls to confirm online transfers. In the United States, financial regulators last June also called for such checks and urged banks to explore newer technologies to combat Internet fraudsters.","'SpyEye' and 'Zeus' can transfer money automatically without supervision .

Memorial: Lady Thatcher herself gave her support to the plans for a library in her honour, which would also run student exchanges . A museum and library devoted to Margaret Thatcher is set to be opened as a permanent memorial to the former prime minister. Supporters aim to raise £15million for the new institution, which will be based on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in California. The Margaret Thatcher Library, which will also include an educational centre, is supported by at least three Cabinet ministers as well as former colleagues of Baroness Thatcher. The library will run training courses to educate the next generation of politicians in her core beliefs of low taxation, support for the individual over the state and the primacy of the free market. Planning for the institution, which will also run exchange student programmes with the US and elsewhere, began in 2009. It is expected to display artefacts from her years in power in the 1980s, including her handbags and her trademark blue Aquascutum suits. Lady Thatcher herself gave her support to the plans, being overseen by the right-wing Conservative Way Forward group, during the final years of her life. In a letter written in February, 2011 to her friend, Conor Burns, the Tory MP who is one of the prime movers behind the project, she wrote: ‘I am extremely interested in the proposals to emulate what is being done in America here in Britain.’ Mr Burns said: ‘The legacy she would most have wanted would have been a living legacy - teaching her beliefs to a new generation.’ Cabinet backers of the plan include Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, and David Jones, the Welsh Secretary. Firm friends: Lady Thatcher could be honoured in a similar way to her ally former U.S. President Ronald Reagan by having a library in her memory . Inspiration: The Ronald W Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in California . Lord Tebbit and Lord Parkinson, two key figures in Lady Thatcher’s Cabinets in the 1980s, have also endorsed the scheme, as have current Thatcherite figures including Liam Fox, the former defence secretary. Mr Pickles said Lady Thatcher was a ‘giant among political leaders’, adding: ‘The establishment of the Margaret Thatcher Library as a last monument to her greatness is a worthy project that I am pleased to support.’ Memorabilia: Lady Thatcher's clothing and possessions from her premiership in the eighties will also go on display . Dr Fox said: ‘This project will ensure that people across the world will have a base at which to learn about Margaret Thatcher’s remarkable life and achievements.’ Lord Parkinson said: ‘This will conserve Lady Thatcher’s legacy and teach a whole new generation about the importance of the work she did as prime minister.’ Ron Robinson, the president of the Reaganite Young America’s Foundation, said: ‘It is critical that Margaret Thatcher’s legacy is protected for future generations. Like her great friend Ronald Reagan, she knew that freedom was never more than one generation away from extinction.’","Supporters aim to raise £15million for The Margaret Thatcher Library .

Claire Smedley says that she is blessed with the biggest cleavage in Britain, but today the 30-year-old revealed on This Morning that she hasn't always been so confident about her curves. The mother-of-three hit the headlines recently after she admitted to almost suffocating her ex-boyfriend with her colossal 40MMM breasts. Her current partner Chris Willgoose has invented a 'warning system' where he taps her legs to flag up any danger moments when they are getting intimate. Today pink-haired Claire from Derby is confident about her figure, even using it to make some money as a part-time model, but in her first TV appearance she told This Morning hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield that she received some startling early advice from her local church group. Claire Smedley claims that she has the biggest breasts in Britain and appeared on This Morning today in her first TV interview . Claire says that her breasts grew almost overnight when she was 11 and along with her new chest came cruel bullying. Aged 12 she was already a DD cup and by the age of 16 she was wearing a H cup bra. She said: 'They stuck out so much, I was tiny with massive boobs. Kids used to undo my bra in class or make me run so they could laugh as they moved around. 'People jump to conclusions when you look like that and think certain things when in fact it couldn't have been more different, I was actually very shy. Claire Smedley, who lives in Derby with her new boyfriend Chris Willgoose, says she is always on her guard during sex after her ex-boyfriend nearly suffocated . 'I was very involved in the church all my free time was spent there. 'I . was pulled aside a few times and told that what I was wearing wasn't . appropriate, even though I was wearing the same clothes as the other . girls. 'Finally I was . pulled aside and told that I should consider having a breast reduction . because it wasn't fair on the men in the group and I was distracting . them. 'That was the sign for me to go completely the other way and I said: right, I'm going to go out clubbing. 'I decided to do all the things that I had never done and I went from totally shy to in your face confident overnight.' During . the interview Holly held up one of Claire's bras to illustrate the size . of her breasts, shocked at the amount of fabric she said: 'Can you . actually buy bras like this?' Holly held up one of Lisa's L cup bras, which is the largest available on the high street and still several sizes too small . Claire has decided against a breast reduction and instead hopes that her glamour modelling career will take off . Claire claims that her breasts weigh . five stone (2.5 stone each), and that although she likes having bib . boobs now it does have its downsides. She said: 'My shoulders ache and I . can't get bras that fit. The biggest size that the high street does is . an 'L' so I squeeze in to them. 'I have had a consultation about having breast reduction but I don't want to take the risk.' Instead, Claire is focusing her efforts on turning her huge chest in to a positive part of her life. She said: 'I've already done a few . modelling shoots, and through the internet I have realised men like . women of all shapes and sizes. 'Who knows what might happen in the next few months?' Claire says she demands sex up to five times a day, blaming high oestrogen levels for both her libido and her large breasts . Claire said she has considered a breast reduction in the past but was told it was not an option because her BMI is too high for surgery .

For the adult who's never outgrown a childhood love of Lego, this could be the home of their dreams. Because while Stratheden, which is for sale in north London's exclusive Bishops Avenue is undoubtedly sophisticated, it also bears more than a passing resemblance to the plastic construction bricks we all remember from our youth. Inside, however, the £34m house offers the ultimate in grown-up luxury, with wall-to-wall mirrors, steam-room, and a ballroom with polished floor the size of a normal house. No expense has been spared in the refurbishment of this 1930s Cape Dutch-style home on the Bishops Avenue - you just need £34m (and then some) to afford it . Built in Cape Dutch style in 1925, it is one of the largest houses on a street that boasts some of the UK's most impressive - and expensive - properties. The Bishops Avenue, also known as Billionaires' Row, is home to oil barons, oligarchs and royalty from Russia,the Middle East and Africa. Knight Frank and Glentree International, the agents who are selling the vast home, are sure the house's features and high-end specification will ensure finding a buyer for Stratheden will be no trouble. The ambassadorial style house boasts nine bedrooms, eight bathrooms, five reception rooms and - despite being located only a short drive from the centre of London - almost one acre of land. One of the stand-out features of the mansion, which was recently rebuilt and has a look of (albeit very expensive) Lego about its exterior, is the ballroom which takes up a staggering 2,700sq/ft - making it perfect for entertaining guests. The room, which could also double up as an art gallery, has the same floor-space as an average family home. The mirrored ballroom has roughly the floorspace of a family's average-sized house - but the buyer of Stratheden probably won't have to vacuum it themselves . With polished marble floor, contemporary artwork and dramatic staircase, guests at the newly-refurbished house will enjoy making quite an entrance . No expense spared: Stratheden has nine bedrooms, eight bathrooms, and an impressive - particularly for London - one-acre garden . You would need to have put in some hard work in Stratheden's gym before you could feel totally confident having a bath in this hall of mirrors . Stratheden, which will attract a stamp duty bill of £2.4m if it sells for the asking price, also has a 12-metre indoor swimming pool with separate gym, steam and sauna rooms, and a massage/hairdressing/spa room. There is also a champagne bar, complete with glitzy silver seating and mirrored bar, where the new owner will be able to toast his or her purchase. Trevor Abrahmsohn, director of Glentree, has sold £3 billion worth of properties on The Bishops Avenue over the past 35 years. He said: 'Stratheden has Cape Dutch architecture and this is unique in the area.  That is why the local authority has listed the building and, as such, preserved its architectural heritage. The dirty plasters and stray hairs of public swimming pools will not trouble the new owner of Stratheden - it boasts its own indoor 12-metre pool, plus separate gym . Stratheden has a jacuzzi and relaxation area beside the pool, which enjoys natural light and French windows onto the one-acre garden . For those wanting to unwind after a hard session in the gym or pool, the mansion has a marble and polished-wood floored champagne bar, complete with silver banquette seating and mirrored bar . There is a subterranean cinema with luxurious burgundy velvet walls where the buyer will be able to relax and forget about their mortgage repayments for a while . This dramatic bathroom is one of eight in the mansion, although if the lady of the house does not feel like washing her own hair, she could pop into the hairdressing salon . 'The pool and leisure area is absolutely stunning and what can one say when you have your own bespoke art gallery/ballroom area and champagne bar, how decadent. 'This is a home for the family that has everything except a home of this quality. You just have to bring your food and clothes and you are ready to rock and roll.' The property is spread over four floors with the leisure complex which includes a cinema based on the subterranean level. Outside, there is a huge drive at the front while the rear boasts an Italian sunken garden, raised garden, water features and a two-bedroom cottage for staff. Stratheden has one acre of garden, which has been landscaped to provide a relatively easy-to maintain space complete with box hedges and small trees . This high-spec kitchen may not be the house's strong spot (and looks like it'd be tricky to keep clean) but the buyer of the house probably won't use it themselves . This pretty bedroom has expensive carpet, sloped ceiling and an attractive round window dating back to the house's origins in the Arts and Crafts period . Stratheden's garden is impressively large for a house so near central London, and water features, pergolas, and a grass lawn that would be perfect for croquet . The Bishops Road is already home to oligarchs, royalty and oil barons, but Stratheden is still one of the biggest houses on the street . The dining table comfortably seats 14 and boasts polished wood parquet flooring, handpainted panels, and a high-spec lighting system . Parquet floors, polished marble and mirrored walls are features of the vast mansion in The Bishops Avenue . The nine-bedroom house looks dramatic at night with its state of the art lighting system and landscaped garden . With corridors lined with gleaming marble and abstract art, the £34m house looks more like an expensive hotel than a home at the moment . To afford a house like this you probably have a business or two - Stratheden comes with a smart office where the new owner will be able to work in peace . The £34m house boasts a stunning, aquamarine tiled steam room where the residents and their guests can sweat away their worries in some style . This kitchen is rather more attractive than the other one, and boasts natural light as well, so perhaps the family of the house might find themselves tempted to cook the odd thing in here - in one of the four ovens... You wouldn't want to have a 'fat day' in here, no matter how rich you are - the heavily-mirrored dressing room would be a nightmare if you weren't feeling confident about how you looked . The in-house hairdressing salon has more mirrors, plus leather-padded walls, as well as a bed for massage treatments . This spare room has a built-in flat-screen TV and plenty of room for guests at Stratheden in north London to sprawl out in the super king-size bed . Whoever designed the house for its recent refurbishment was fond of geometrically-framed vistas: The marble staircase and the garden's pergolas are both stunning . Natural light pours in through the cupola, highlighting the expensively polished wooden floor - and acres of space (plus more mirrors) An in-house sauna is de rigueur for the mega-rich these days, so Stratheden is fitted with a large one as standard . This ensuite bathroom offers views onto the garden, a large bath with marble surround, and modern sink and high-pressure shower . Luxury fittings in the house include smart polished wood wardrobes, left, and a breath-taking shower lined with astonishingly beautiful polished stone, right .","Stratheden House on The Bishops Avenue in north London is one of the largest houses in a very expensive street .

The young woman who was comforted in the aftermath of the Boston bombings by a man who falsely claimed he was a wounded Afghanistan veteran does not regret the white lie he told. Hysterical after her left leg was shredded by shrapnel when one of the Boston bombs detonated, Victoria McGrath was soothed by the calming words of Tyler Dodd, who said that he had been injured during his time in service. While this was not true, Dodds is an ex-oil rig worker, McGrath said that all that matters to her is the effect his words had at the time - as the two were tearfully reunited at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. Scroll Down for Video . Northeastern University student Victoria McGrath, 20, who was seriously injured in the Boston Marathon bombing, meets the heroes responsible for rescuing her, without whom, doctors say, she would have died . Victoria McGrath was reunited with Tyler Dodd - the man whose words of comfort calmed her down after she had been seriously wounded in the Boston bombings . In an interview with the Today show, McGrath explained how Dodd's calming voice helped her to relax before she was seen by first responders inside the Boston marathon medical tent. Last week, Dood, who identifies as a recovering alcoholic said, 'he saw the terror in the eyes' of McGrath and 'knew I had to talk to her'. 'She asked me not to leave her. She was holding my hand. There was some kind of connection on a spiritual level, I would have to say, cause when I told it was going to be okay, she believed me,' he told Fox News. Northeastern University student McGrath was told by Dodd that he was a Marine who had served in the Afghanistan War. He managed to calm the young woman over her injuries by showing her where he had been hit in the leg by shrapnel during his deployment. Watch the full video on TODAY . Hero: Victoria McGrath, 20, a student at Northeastern University credits Tyler Dodd with saving her life with his comforting words . Horror: Victoria was pictured being carried to safety by Boston fireman Jim Plourde . Victoria McGrath, 20, is expected to regain full used of her left leg as she recovers and may one day walk without a limp . Hero - but not a soldier: Former oil rig worker Tyler Dodd, rushed to the aid of wounded college student, Victoria McGrath . That turned out not to be the case - Dodd told her that to help her to calm down. 'He wasn't a combat soldier in Afhganistan - he wasn't in combat,' said McGrath. 'I don't regret it - I don't regret him telling me that. The truth behind Dodds claims were revealed as he made frequent appearances on national television where interviewers quizzed him on his service history. He admitted to never having been in the military. Currently making a satifactory recovery from her injuries, McGrath suffered extensive nerve damage to her leg when shrapnel tore through it as she stood five-feet away from the blast. And in addition to Dodds, McGrath was reunited with the three other complete strangers who saved her life on Monday 15th April. Meeting up with Bruce Mendhelson, Alicia Shamba and firefighter Jim Plourde, McGrath became emotional. Especially so when it was revealed to Mendhelson that the toruniquet he applied to her leg was responsible for saving her life - because the shrapnel had nicked an artery, causing her to bleed profusely. In the aftermath of the devastating . twin bombings, an appeal was put out on her behalf to find Dodd, who . helped calm her as she became ‘completely hysterical’ - and in her view . saved her life. At the . time, Tyler said that he was a marine - but subsequent interviews . revealed that he was indeed an ex-oil rig worker and recovering . alcoholic who had lived in Boston for only a year. Tyler Dodd has given a series of interviews since he aided Victoria McGrath in which he admitted he was not a veteran of the Afghanistan conflict . Victoria McGrath said that she bore no ill-will towards Tyler Dodd - despite him lying to her about his veteran status . Victoria McGrath (left) with Alicia Shamba (center) and Tyler Dodd (right) discussing the parts they all played in her rescue . Alicia Shamba was one of the first responders to encounter Victoria McGrath in the medical tent of the Boston marathon following the explosions . 'I had no idea this is what he (God) had planned for me,' he said. 'It was pure chaos immediately following. There were people screaming, a lot of people with lower extremity injuries, and a lot of blood,' he said of the aftermath. 'It was really surreal. In this situation, you run on autopilot, so you don't have to really feel anything. To be honest with you, I didn't know what to feel at the time. It was an unbelievable scene. 'What sticks out in my mind more than the injuries or the chaos or the trauma was peoples' selflessness in the situation and how many people were willing to help despite the police telling us we were in immediate danger.' Bruce Mendhelson (right) was told that by placing a tourniquet onto Victoria McGrath's wound - he most likely saved her life from blood loss . Bruce Mendhelson (left) is reunited with Victoria McGrath (center) and firefighter Jim Plourde (right) who carried her to safety . Victoria, 20, sustained a serious shrapnel wound to her leg in the first blast during the Boston Marathon on Monday which left three dead and over 240 injured. She was carried to safety by Boston fireman Jim Plourde who left her in a medical tent with Sgt Tyler. A hospital spokeswoman said when she was there Tyler told Victoria: 'You’re going to have a scar, but you’re going to be OK. It’ll be like my scar'. MailOnline has discovered that Victoria is a business, administration and accounting student at Northeastern University in Boston, speaks two languages and works at Banana Republic to make some extra cash amongst her other jobs. This X-ray from Tufts medical center shows a one-centimeter long piece of shrapnel which came within inches of making Victoria McGrath an amputee . Victoria’s cousin Catherine McGrath said that Victoria ‘thinks that Sgt Tyler saved her life’. She said: ‘She is still in hospital and has had surgery once already on her leg. I think she’s having surgery today. Her parents Jill and James work as executives at IBM, Catherine said. She said: ‘Victoria spent 10 years in the UK so grew up there. She also spent a few years in Paris. She’s not long come back to the US. ‘In the UK she lived outside of London. She may have been born there but I’m not certain’. Recovery: Victoria, left, is suffering from a compound fracture and has nerve damage. Her family describe her as a 'wonderful person and beautiful, inside and out' Rescue: Victoria sustained a serious shrapnel wound to her leg in the first blast during the Boston Marathon on Monday which left three dead and more than 180 injured . Mr Plourde, 35, carried out the first part of the rescue and the image of him carrying Victoria in his arms became an iconic picture of the blast. In an interview he said that he was just doing his job and dismissed suggestions he is brave, even though he is married and has a 15-month-old daughter himself. Recounting what he saw on the day, he said: ‘Here was a guy with a young girl, and he's like, `you've got to help her,' and he just started putting the tourniquet on and I said, `you got to get out of here,' and he said `you got to take her out.'","Initially reported that Tyler Dodd who comforted student Victoria McGrath was a military veteran .

Although the BlackBerry has fallen behind rivals, many 'power' users have stayed loyal because they prefer a physical keyboard over the touch screen on the iPhone and most Android devices. However, the initial reviews of the handset are not encouraging. 'Anyone who doesn't need a physical keyboard should skip it,' said Cnet, while Ars Technica said ' For most buyers, though, it's going to feel like a throwback, and we don't mean that in a good way.' In the UK, Selfridges will exclusively launch the new and highly anticipated BlackBerry Q10 in all its stores and online on Friday 26th April. In a European exclusive, Selfridges and Selfridges.com will be the only place in Europe to purchase the BlackBerry Q10, for £579.99, in store and online until Monday 29th, when it will then be available nationwide.

Blackberry is bullish about the handset's chances. 'Built with precision and offering premium performance in a timeless design, the BlackBerry Q10 smartphone combines BlackBerry’s best physical keyboard and a touch screen with the power of the BlackBerry 10 platform,' it says. BlackBerry chief executive Thorsten Heins believes the handsets will beat the iPhone, which makes up 38% of the installed base of smartphones in the US, against 5.9% for BlackBerry, Heins told the Associated Press agency that Apple lacked innovation and that the phone could not multitask: .

'The BlackBerry Q10 is, for the most part, exactly what we expected it to be: a Z10 with a smaller display and a physical keyboard. The Q10 is unquestionably the best phone with a keyboard on the market. However, given how weak the competition and demand there has become, we're not sure cornering that market will move the needle very far in BlackBerry's favor. Engadget . 'The BlackBerry Q10 is a great phone for QWERTY diehards and e-mail addicts, but anyone who doesn't need a physical keyboard should skip it.' CNET . The Q10 is the one you’ll see clenched in the fists of type-A personalities in Thomas Pink suits as they race through airports, chase down taxis, and eagerly await their skim lattes. These are the BlackBerry elite, and they are going to love this phone as soon as their IT department tells them it’s OK to. But if you’re not the typing type, and especially if you live for your apps and your photos, you’re better off sticking to the black rectangles with the bigger screens. Wired . 'The Q10 is a very solid and well-built little phone, and it's one of the few options available from any smartphone ecosystem for the physical keyboard holdouts.

Millions of Facebook users have already seen a link at the top of their desktop news feed requesting them to follow 'simple security tips'. Security measure: Facebook is asking each of its more than 900million active users to provide it with their mobile phone number . Those that click on the link are led to the site's security page where they are asked to pick a unique password and given a tutorial on how to spot an online scam. They are then requested to provide their phone number for secure account recovery. This, Facebook claims, works because when a user confirms their phone number it allows  the site to automatically wipe their password in the event of their account being hacked. The social network would then send a text message to the user informing that their password has been changed. This, the site reasons, would be preferable to sending the user and email because many of these are ignored as assumed junk and get deleted.

Wine expert Robert Jefferson Walker, known as Jeff, was found by a snowboarder in the Grey Area, which is owned by the U.S. forest service and is permanently closed to skiers. He was found with a gun next to his body. Sheriff Joe DiSalvo told the Aspen Times: 'There is no evidence of foul play. But we . investigate all deaths as if they were homicides.'

A debate is raging in Germany over whether the national football squad should pay its respect at the site of the Nazi death camp of Auschwitz when the team plays in the European Championships in Poland this summer. Auschwitz, built by the Nazis near Krakow during the Second World War, was the extermination camp which murdered 1.2 million of the six million victims of the Holocaust. Now a museum and place of remembrance, thousands of German schoolchildren are among the hundreds of thousands who visit it annually. Difficult decision: A debate is raging in Germany over whether the national soccer squad should pay its respect at the site of the Nazi death camp of Auschwitz when the team plays in the European Championships in Poland this summer . The England squad has already said it . will make a pilgrimage to the site to pay respects to the dead.  But for . Germany, it is a more tortured and complex issue. Formercaptain Jürgen Klinsmann is among those who does believe . they should attend because 'players are ' models for so many young . people' Dieter Graumann, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany whose grandparents were gassed there, is among those who says the team should visit the site, arguing; 'It would send a disastrous message to the rest of the world if the German players were to bypass Auschwitz. 'The young players don't bear the blame, but they do bear the responsibility.' Protestant and Catholic church leaders also say they should go but it is understood that the German FA is not keen on the idea, that it would not only draw attention away from the football but might also put an intolerable emotional strain on individuals. Henryk Broder, a prominent German-Jewish writer, is also opposed to the gesture. In an article in the news magazine Der Spiegel he said; 'What are the footballers supposed to do in Auschwitz? Swear that they're sorry? Explain that this sort of thing can ""never happen again?"" And has anyone thought about what would happen if the German players visited Auschwitz and became so overcome by emotion that they lost the tournament? 'It isn't about the players visiting Auschwitz. It's about the images of the visit that will be broadcast to the rest of the world afterwards - as if they were touring an SOS Children's Village in Africa to draw the world's attention to the misery of war orphans. 'The German footballers have no business going to Auschwitz. That is, unless some of them choose to go there on their own and without the cameras, for personal reasons that would make them accountable to no one. 'If the German Football Association wanted to take Graumann's advice and ""send a message"", it could come up with something more original than an obligatory visit to a place where wreaths are deposited, and where visitors can show their retroactive consternation for free. 'Showing solidarity for dead Jews is a cheap exercise. The people who were murdered can't be killed again, nor can they be rescued retroactively. 'But in case someone does feel something resembling 'responsibility' - and there's nothing wrong with that, in principle - then he would be better off declaring his solidarity with those who are alive today, and would like to stay that way.' 'Cheap exercise': There are some who say the German players, pictured at the World Cup in 2010, should not visit Auschwitz . German newspapers are filled with those who argue that it is a duty of the footballers to pay their respects there and others, like Broder, who say there is no need for them to go. But former team captain Jürgen Klinsmann is among those who does believe they should attend because 'players such as Özil, Klose, Gomez, Schweinsteiger or Khedira are the idols of today, the role models for so many young people'. 'If they attend a simple ceremony at Auschwitz and are moved by it, then much can be achieved,' he added. It is understood the government would like the team to make a gesture at the camp as neo-Nazism rises in Germany, particularly among the young, and Internet propaganda denying that the genocide of the Jews ever took place continues to proliferate.","The England squad has already said it .

Roona Begum, who suffers from a severe case of rare condition Hydrocephalus, will have the excess fluid drained in a procedure to take place at India's largest private hospital in Gurgoan, near Delhi, tomorrow. After her plight appeared in a number of publications, including MailOnline, a charity came forward to offer help. Scroll down for video . New hope: Roona begum will undergo surgery to drain fluid from her brain tomorrow after a charity stepped in to help her . Heartbreaking: 18-month-old Roona's head has swelled to more than three times its normal size due to a rare condition which has caused fluid to collect on her brain . Getting help: Dr Sandeep Vaishya, from the Fortis Memorial Research Institute, examines Roona Begum, who was born with Hydrocephalus . The Fortis Foundation flew Roona's poverty-stricken family from their rural village to the hospital where doctors hope that the exploratory procedure will relieve the pressure and allow them to properly examine Roona before deciding how to treat her further. Doctors have already said that the youngster is lucky to be alive, with most sufferers of the condition not surviving beyond a year old. Dr Sandeep Vaishya, Director of Neurosurgery at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, who is treating Roona, said: 'I was surprised when I saw the baby for the first time. Even though I had seen her pictures, I wasn't expecting the head to be so big. 'Her head measures 94 cm, in similar cases the average measurement is around 50-60 cm. Worried: Parents Abdul, 19 and Fatima Khatoon, 24, sit by their daughter's bedside in hospital ahead of tomorrow's surgical procedure . Treatment: Roona is being treated at a private hospital after the Fortis Foundation offered to help . Loving: Fatima Khatoon attempts to comfort her young daughter as she rests in her hospital bed . 'It is swollen to an extent that she is not able to close her eyes completely. We have an opthamologist looking at her eyes, so that there are no complications there. 'We are hopeful that she will make a complete recovery. The challenge is to drain her brain fluid in a gradual manner, so as the brain gets used to it.' Poorly: Doctors say that Roona is lucky to be alive as sufferers of the condition normally do not live beyond a year . Roona's mother Fatima, 24, said: 'When she was born, I wondered why do children of poor people like us suffer this fate? 'Why is fate cruel to us? Why do rich people who can afford to cure their kids never get diseases like this? 'Before she was born, I went to a doctor twice. Once when I was one month pregnant and than when I was six months pregnant. We did not have money to go more often. 'She was born through a Caesarian operation and the doctor told us we had to take her out of Agartala to get her treated. But we did not have any money at all.' But the devastated mother revealed some family members had been less than supportive. Fatima added: 'When she is better, I hope my in-laws accept her. And she can have the love she deserves from her grandparents.' Roona's father Abdul, 19, added: 'Even though our neighbours come and play with her, my parents have refused to acknowledge her existence, since she was born.' Abdul, who earns the equivalent of just £1.82 a day as a labourer thanked those who had helped Roona. He said: 'I cannot find work every day. Its hard enough to earn for food, so her treatment would have been impossible had it not been for the press and hospital people who have helped us.'","Roona Begum suffers from a severe case of Hydrocephalus .

"By . Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 03:01 EST, 10 November 2011 . She has taken the challenge of overcoming her phobia one step at a time. And finally Louise Wilson feels she has beaten her life-long phobia of stairs. The 43-year-old is so scared of going up and down steps has had to turn down countless jobs in offices without lifts due teachers would have to meet her on the ground floor at her son’s parents’ evenings. And the fear - bathmophobia, as it is known - she has had since she was five meant she could only go up to the first floor of her home by clinging to the wall. Daunting: Louise is finally learning to face her fears of stairs after sessions with a hypnotherapist . In one of her most trying episodes she had to go down a flight of stairs on her bottom after an escalator broke down in the shop she was visiting. She said: 'I remember going into Marks and Spencer in my 20s, and just about being able to get upstairs on an escalator. 'But to my horror, I realised there was . only a huge flight of stairs to go down. I completely panicked, and to . my shame, had to sit on the steps on slide down one by one while . clinging onto the rail. 'I think people thought I was drunk, or mad, but to me the embarrassment was nothing compared to my fear.' The phobia progressed as she got older to the stage where she could no longer cope with slatted and open-sided stairs. Finally, the mother-of-one sought help after her son became interested in castles and she was to frightened to go and visit them with him. New head for heights: The mother-of-one developed her phobia after falling down a slide as a child . Louise said: 'I truly don't remember a time when I wasn't scared of stairs and heights; it's just always been there. 'I would get panicky and full of . adrenaline - I didn't know what it's like to not be frightened. It was a . true phobia - I would just freeze when faced with stairs, specially . open-slatted and open sided staircases. 'I'd feel dizzy and sick, and just want to grip the floor or the walls.' Bathmophobia is triggered when a sufferer sees a steep slope or steps. In that way it differs from climacophobia, which results when sufferers are expected to actually climb or descend them. Children and adults can suffer from bathmophobia - and it is fairly common household pets. Bathmophobia, as with other clinical fears, is generally not diagnosed in children unless it persists for more than six months. It can be caused by a wide range of factors, but experts say a particularly common cause is an early negative experience with stairs or a steep hill, such as a trip or a fall. The mother from Coventry sought help by visiting hypnotherapist Russell Hemmings in September. Mr Hemmings said: 'When I met Louise, she came to me believing she had . a fear of heights. 'But after a few sessions, we realised that her real fear was stairs - especially open slatted ones. 'A couple of weeks into the treatment, . we discovered a suppressed memory Louise had of falling off the top of a . slide when she was a young child. 'Her parents told her the incident had happened, and we believe that is where her fear stems from.' Mr Hemmings used a combination of hypnotherapy and Neuro Linguistic Programming to tackle her phobia. He said: 'Unless you had seen . how genuinely frightened Louise was when she came to me, it's difficult . to appreciate how well she has done. 'She has worked really hard, and we've visited ""scary"" stairs together. 'It just goes to show that however long you have been suffering with phobias for, it's never too late to get help. Hypnotherapist Russell Hemmings helped Louise by uncovering the underlying feared event . Louise added: 'Before, . I couldn't go to my son's school to see his work in the classroom . because it was upstairs. Even on parents' evening, the teachers had to . come downstairs to meet me. 'It was mortifying, but there was nothing I could do to get rid of this completely irrational fear. 'I finally feel as though I can begin to live my life properly now. 'It's so nice to know that I am able to go out with my family and not have to fret about where we're going and how I'll be able to avoid the stairs. 'I still don't feel 100 per cent comfortable around them, but I know it's a fear I can control now - and in time, I hope I won't be bothered by them at all.' Mrs wilson, who walked up stairs for the first time since she was a child three weeks ago, said: 'There’s so much I’d like to do now, like go to college. That was something I couldn’t have done before - it’s certainly opened up my options. 'I couldn’t have done it on my own, that’s for sure.'","Louise Wilson had 'bathmophobia' since she was five .

Caught: Fugitive Spanish terror suspect Raul Angel Fuentes Villota who has been on the run for 17 years . A suspected ETA terrorist linked to several murders was arrested in Britain today after 17 years on the run. Raul Sanchez Fuentes Villota, 47, was held in Liverpool in a joint operation by UK and Spanish police. The suspected terrorist was detained on an European Arrest Warrant issued by a judge at the National Court in Madrid, which deals mostly with terrorist cases. The interior ministry said Fuentes was arrested at 9am in Liverpool, where he 'was residing with false documentation, waiting to receive instructions from the leadership of the terrorist group ETA.' They said he had been part of an ETA terror cell called the Matalaz Cell, responsible for several terrorist attacks in Spain. He allegedly joined the organisation in 1990 and was trained in firearms and explosives. The Matalaz Cell has been linked by Spanish security services to several murders. They include the April 1991 assassination of police officer Jose Manuel Cruz Martin, who was killed in a car bomb in Baracaldo. He was arrested allegedly trying to carry out a similar murder two months later. The interior ministry said in a statement: 'Following a shootout in June 1991 officers from the National Police arrested Fuentes and other members of the cell when they tried to place a limpet bomb in the vehicle of an officer from the National Police in Baracaldo.' Wanted: Several alleged members of ETA have been arrested in the UK recently. Antonio Troitino Arranz, left, has been convicted of 22 murders, and Ignacio Lerin Sanchez, right, is considered one of ETA’s most dangerous terrorists . Fuentes was arrested in June 1991 allegedly trying to plant a bomb under the car of a police officer in Barakaldo, in Vizcaya, a province in northern Spain. He and two other alleged ETA members, Juan Maria San Pedro Blanco and German Urizar de Paz, exchanged fire with Spanish police officers as before they were arrested at the scene of the terror plot. Fuentes was released on bail in June 1995 after spending four years on remand without trial - the longest allowed under Spanish law. He disappeared two months later and an arrest warrant was issued in September 1995. In 2002 police found a document linking Fuentes to the senior military leadership of ETA, after arresting ETA military leader Juan Fernandez Iradi. Spain's Interior Ministry said in a . statement: 'British police in collaboration with the National Police . have this morning arrested the suspected member of ETA Raul Sanchez . Fuentes Villota in Liverpool. 'The whereabouts of Fuentes Villota, suspected of several murders, have been unknown since 1995.' Destruction: In July 1986 Troitino detonated a car bomb by remote control in the Plaza de la Republica Dominicana in Madrid. The blast destroyed a Civil Guard van, killing 12 officers and wounding 51 people . Several alleged members of ETA have been arrested in the UK recently. They include Antonio Troitino, convicted of 22 murders, who was held in Hounslow, west London, in June. Another fugitive, Benat Atorrasagasti was held as he walked out of a pub in Edinburgh the following month. And police held ETA chief Eneko Gogeaskoetxea, 44, at a house in Cambridge, in July last year. Killed: ETA separatists blew up a car in Madrid in 2000 killing Lt. Col. Pedro Antonio Garcia Blanco Garcia. ETA has killed more than 800 people since it launched its campaign for an independent Basque state . Gogeaskoetxea, wanted for attempting to assassinate King Juan Carlos in 1997, had been living there with his wife and two children under an assumed name and was a member of the local squash club. Anti-terrorism experts say Britain became a favourite bolt-hole for ETA terrorists after France began cooperating with Spain to track down fugitives living there. Spanish intelligence sources say there are around 180 ETA terrorists on the run. ETA has killed more than 800 people since it launched its campaign for an independent Basque state in the late 1960s. In January last year the group announced a 'permanent ceasefire' following more than 40 years of bloodshed. The terrorist group is being urged to hand over its weapons and make a public apology to victims.

The Olympics and Paralympics may be over, but the insect world is stepping into the breach with some incredible displays of synchronised gymnastics. The clever caterpillars were snapped showing off their moves in front of the watchful eye of amateur photographer Aleksandr Chorny near the River Teterev, Ukraine. He captured the six-strong party of acrobatic caterpillars who seemed delighted with the opportunity to show off their balancing acts whilst carefully clinging on to the side of a leaf. The caterpillars were captured in a series of perfectly executed synchonised moves by a Ukranian photographer . The Ermine moth caterpillar, native . to British-like climates, measure in at just 1.5cm. They tend to move in large groups. They are known to coat large areas with thick silk webs up to 20 feet long. The Ukranian photographer has only been working behind the camera for the past three years and has now turned his hand to specializing in macro -photography. He was taken by surprise by the creative performance when he was out walking along the river. As the sun goes down they often come to life and start nibbling their way through leaves and plants but these ones seemed more interested in trying out their dance routines than getting their daily meal. Green-fingered gardeners are likely to find ermine caterpillars like these a bit of a pest as they're famed for creating whopping silk webs up to 20 foot long. Whilst the webs may look like beautiful works of nature, they're capable of destroying gardeners' hard- grown plants which become cocooned under the webs to be used later for the caterpillar's lunch.Aleksandr, 28, a full-time artist, caught the creepy crawlies on an Olympus E-3 camera over an hour- long period. These congo-ing caterpillars have been caught taking to the stage to display their well- rehearsed version of the famous Conga party dance near the River Teterev in Northern Ukraine . He said: 'I was totally amazed by how peculiar their behavior was because I'd never seen anything like this before. 'When I tried to blow on them, their tails kept getting higher and higher until they were almost standing up vertically. 'It was as if they were reacting to the movement of air. 'I loved seeing the different ways that their bodies could move and watching them felt like I was at a circus show. 'This type of macro photography is my favourite because it gives people the ability to see the hidden world and the beautiful things that can't normally be seen by the naked eye.'

Greece is facing a rise in hospital-acquired infections because its cash-strapped health service cannot afford basic supplies such as gloves, gowns and alcohol wipes. Europe’s top health official said Greek hospitals are in such dire straits that staff are failing to keep up basic disease controls, threatening a rise in multi-drug-resistant infections. Greece already has one of the worst problems in Europe with hospital-acquired infections, and disease experts fear this is being made worse by a severe economic crisis that has cut health care staffing levels and hurt standards of care. Greece is facing a rise in hospital-acquired infections because its cash-strapped health service cannot afford basic supplies such as gloves, gowns and alcohol wipes (picture posed by model) With fewer doctors and nurses to look after more patients, and hospitals running low on cash for supplies, risks are being taken even with basic hygiene, said Marc Sprenger, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). 'I have seen places...where the financial situation did not allow even for basic requirements like gloves, gowns and alcohol wipes,' Mr Sprenger said after a two-day trip to Athens, where he visited hospitals and other healthcare facilities. 'We already knew Greece is in a very bad situation regarding antibiotic resistant infections, and after visiting hospitals there I’m now really convinced we have reached one minute to midnight in this battle,' he said. Mr Sprenger said the situation means patients with highly-infectious diseases like tuberculosis (TB) may not get the treatment they need, raising the risk that dangerous drug-resistant forms will tighten their grip on Europe. Many health workers have lost their jobs and others say they have not been properly paid for months. Difficult: The economic crisis has devastated Greece. This is a picture of Greeks struggling as they wait to receive free food . Panos Papanicolaou, a member of a doctors’ union and a neurosurgeon at Athens’ Nikea General Hospital, said staff cuts mean as many as 90 to 100 patients a day wait in corridors with many unable to get treatment. In the chaos, some go untreated or come back again when they are far more seriously ill. He said overworked nurses often treat twice as many patients as before and confirmed that the shortage of basic items like disposable gloves meant corners were having to be cut. 'If a nurse has to see 10 patients instead of five without disposable gloves it’s certain that the transmission of infections will rise rapidly,' he said. Greece could soon face even more problems with its health care system if it runs out of money to buy drugs. Another health official who asked to remain anonymous said a senior Athens hospital worker had told him there was no budget left for supplies at that hospital, so all its drug purchases were on credit. Roberto Bertollini, the World Health Organisation’s chief scientist and representative to the European Union, told Reuters he too was worried about the rate of hospital-acquired infections in Greece. He said cuts to resources and staff only make it harder to adhere to infection control and hygiene rules. 'Countries have to be very careful when..choosing what to cut and what to keep,' he said. 'This is a very serious business which might impact the health of the population much more in the medium term, thus increasing rather than decreasing costs.'","Europe’s top health official said Greek .

Homes are now taking so long to sell in the sluggish housing market that sellers are trying all sorts of ways to move things along. Some entice buyers by including sit-on mowers in the fixtures and fittings. In Sandbanks, Bournemouth’s millionaires’ row, an ocean-going boat was recently thrown into the sale. In Kennington, outside Ashford in Kent, one couple – Ian and Anna Grant – have gone one stage further. The Grants have dreamed up a scheme where, if they find buyers for their own Grade II listed mill house, and those buyers are having trouble selling, they will buy their purchaser’s home themselves. Ambitious offer: Anna and Ian Grant, pictured outside their current home, are offering to 'swap' their home for a prospective buyer's . It sounds too good to be true but Ian, 82, who spent his working life in the motor trade, has clearly thought through every detail. ‘We’ll give slightly below market value for our buyer’s house to pay for estate agents’ fees and to cover the hassle of having to sell the house for them,’ he explains. ‘But what’s the matter with that? You wouldn’t expect to be given the full sale price of a car if you sold it to a garage in a part-exchange deal, so the same should apply to a house.’ Not surprisingly, there are some limits on the offer: the couple insist that any purchasers’ home they buy must be in saleable condition – and that it costs less than the mill house. Priced at £910,000 – and divided into two parts – the couple’s property is no ‘run-of-the-mill’ mill house. The main section, including six bedrooms, a sitting room, drawing room, dining room and kitchen, is an impressive Georgian home, with low ceilings, original open fireplaces, cornicing and superb views over the mill stream to the wooded gardens and grounds. Rural charm: The front of the six-bedroom Grade II listed home in Kennington near Ashford, Kent . Adjoining this part of the house is the second part of the property – what used to be the old mill building. This amounts to three rooms of bare space, each 30ft x 17ft, arranged above one another on separate floors. Ian used the ground floor room as a snooker room and the two others were Anna’s offices and studios. Although these rooms could be used by a future owner as, say, a gallery space, they are, to be blunt, scruffy. Anna says: ‘I can see people’s faces when I show them around. They stand there thinking, “What on earth can we do with this?” ’ The answer, the couple suggest, is to renovate this part of the house into a self-contained home. Alex Davies, a director at estate agents Hobbs Parker, believes this could be achieved for £50,000. Aren’t the Grants taking a bit of a gamble, volunteering to buy a house that is likely to be another ‘sticker’ on the market? Traditional interior: One of the bathrooms in the six-bedroom mill house property . ‘We don’t think so,’ says Anna, 76, who was a professional ballet dancer in the late Fifties before becoming an actress in the Sixties, once playing opposite Sean Connery in a television drama. ‘We have money to invest, and interest rates from the banks are so low that in the long term we are better off putting our money into property, thereby killing two birds with one stone.’ Anyone who suspects that this scheme has come about because the Grants are less than financially secure should think again. Anna recently sold her own business – dealing in the ingredients that make cosmetics – and she did well enough out of it to move into the couple’s new main home, which is a 15-acre estate outside Sittingbourne, complete with pet donkeys, dogs and pigs. Ian, a successful rally driver in his time, is also comfortably off. The couple also have a house in London and they have no pressing financial need to sell the mill house. Yet tough business people though they are, it is obvious that the mill house, which they bought 12 years ago, is very special to them. ‘We have had some marvellous garden parties here,’ says Ian. ‘Once we had a marquee and it was simply too hot for anyone to stay inside it, so the guests moved under the ancient chestnut tree and dipped their feet in the stream. We’d like others to get similar pleasure out of the old place.’ The Mill House is for sale with www.hobbsparker.co.uk, 01233 502222 and www.struttandparker.com, 01227 451123.","Six-bedroom Georgian mill house on the market for £910,000 .

Smiling through: Lily Cater, 9, with her mother Michala who is living a normal life after doctors said she would never recover from her heart defect . A mother has told how her daughter’s life was saved by heart surgery – despite doctors at Leeds General Infirmary claiming ‘nothing could be done’ for her. Michala Cater, 39, claims she was told that her two-year-old daughter Lily would not recover from her congenital heart defect and that she should ‘go away and enjoy the time she had left’ with her. But after seeking a second opinion, Lily had surgery at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. The nine-year-old is now living a normal life. Mrs Cater, of Bradford, believes Lily would be dead if she had listened to the consultant cardiologist at Leeds seven years ago. At eight months old, Lily was diagnosed with pulmonary atresia, or ‘blue baby syndrome’ – when the pulmonary artery that carries blood to the lungs fails to develop properly. Mrs Cater claims doctors at the heart unit said she would probably not live beyond five years old. Then, when she was two, Lily took a turn for the worst. She was constantly blue and struggled to walk any distance. ‘We waited six months for the doctors to have a clinical meeting to discuss what to do,’ Mrs Cater said. ‘When we finally spoke to the cardiologist, he said he had spoken to a surgeon and there was nothing they could do for her. ‘He said she wouldn’t get on a heart transplant list because they couldn’t say for definite that she only had two months to live, but you could see how ill she was.’ In danger: Mr and Mrs Cater were told that Lily would not recover when she was two years old by Leeds General Infirmary.

In the months before the terrorist attacks of September 2001, the CIA unit dedicated to hunting for Osama bin Laden complained that it was running out of money. Analysts considered the likelihood of catching the terror leader to be extremely low, according to government records published yesterday. The declassified documents, dated between 1992 and 2004, are heavily blacked out and offer little new information about what the U.S. knew about the Al-Qaeda plot before 2001. Priority: It has emerged that the hunt for Osama bin Laden, pictured here in TV footage broadcast after the 9/11 attacks, had been underfunded prior to the terrorist outrage in New York . Many of the files are cited in the 9/11 Commission report, published in 2004. The commission determined the failure that led to 9/11 was a lack of imagination, and U.S. intelligence agencies did not connect the dots that could have prevented the attacks. The National Security Archive obtained the documents through a Freedom of Information Act request and published them on its website. An April 2000 document from the CIA's . bin Laden unit alluded to a budgetary cash crunch that was cutting into . the agency's efforts to track the terror leader. Outrage: Smoke pouring from World Trade Centre in New York after its hit by a plane used as a weapon by terrorist from Bin Laden's international network . At that time, Al-Qaeda was a major concern to U.S. intelligence agencies because of the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed many, including two CIA employees. Bin Laden had declared a holy war against the U.S., and the CIA had received multiple warnings that Al-Qaeda intended to strike the U.S. A heavily blacked-out document titled Islamic Extremist Update said 'need forward movement on supplemental soonest'. The supplemental budget was still being reviewed by the national security council and White House Office of Management and Budget. Because of budgetary constraints, the bin Laden unit would move from an 'offensive to defensive posture', the document said. This meant that officials feared they would have to shelve some of their more elaborate proposals to track al-Qaida and instead rely on existing resources. The Uzbek Initiative, referenced in the same document, was one of the more expensive programs the CIA ran at the time, according to a source familiar with the initiative. Aftermath: The World Trade Center on the sixth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks when attempts to track down Bin Laden were seriously stepped up but would fail to succeed for another five years . Huge impact: The New York sky line with the Twin Towers before the Bin Laden inspired 9/11 attack - but new documents reveal that before the terror operation attempts to track down the Al-Qaeda were underfunded . The program involved paying off CIA tipsters who monitored bin Laden followers traveling through Uzbekistan. The source spoke anonymously as a condition of describing the sensitive program. The documents do not make clear whether the portion of the budget in question was passed. But they hint at complaints later detailed publicly after the 9/11 attacks by previous directors of the Bin Laden unit that the Bush and Clinton administrations did not fully appreciate the severity of the threat, and as a result failed to fully fund their operations. The documents also show that U.S. officials were concerned that Bin Laden was using Afghanistan's national airline to carry in vast cash reserves when he was sheltered by the ruling Taliban mullahs in the late 1990s. The CIA's National Intelligence Daily in June 1999 urged the imposition of sanctions on Ariana Airlines, then controlled by the Taliban, in order to put pressure on bin Laden's cash flow. His cash flow reportedly depended heavily on flights from the United Arab Emirates into Afghanistan. The document said: 'Closing of Ariana's UAE offices would force them to find alternative - and most likely less secure - carriers, routes and methods for moving bin Laden's cash.' Knowledge: U.S. officials were concerned that Bin Laden was using Afghanistan's national airline to carry in vast cash reserves in the late 1990s, but there are hints that previous directors of the Bin Laden unit that the Bush and Clinton administrations did not fully appreciate the severity of the threat . Later that year, the U.S. and United Nations imposed harsh sanctions on Afghanistan and its airline, shutting down all flights and closing Ariana's offices abroad. The newly released files also offer details about the subsequent investigations into the attacks. In one case, the U.S. intelligence community investigated a link between one of the hijackers and the Iraqi Intelligence Service - a connection that was later proved false but that the White House used in its campaign to connect the attacks to Iraq. According to a December, 2001, CIA report that was sent to the White House Situation Room, the CIA had already made a preliminary determination that 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta had not in fact traveled to Prague in the Czech Republic in May 2000 to rendezvous with a senior official of the Iraqi Intelligence Service. Atta was an Egyptian national who piloted American Airlines Flight 11 into the World Trade Center. That he would have met with the IIS was significant for intelligence officials looking for a connection between al-Qaida and Iraq. Lack of focus: It is suggested that President George Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney (left to right pictured in 2004) were reluctant to fund expensive CIA programmes to track down Bin Laden for the 9/11 attacks . But just one day after the report was sent to the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney claimed on NBC's Meet the Press that it had been 'pretty confirmed' that Atta had gone to Prague several months before the attack. According to the 9/11 Commission report, it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity after a Pakistani with a similar name tried to get into the Czech Republic but was turned away. The document was the basis for a footnote in chapter seven of the 9/11 report. Even though the information about Atta meeting with the ISS was later disproved, it still resonated with those bent on going to war with Iraq. The hundreds of pages of CIA files released Tuesday include a chronology of the agency's efforts to catch bin Laden. A March 2004 CIA report entitled, The Rise of UBL and al-Qaida and the Intelligence Community Response, discusses the likelihood of the CIA capturing bin Laden in the late 1990s using Afghans to do the job. The CIA estimated that none of the available Afghan units had more than a 10 percent chance of capturing the heavily guarded bin Laden. Another option was using Ahmed Shah Massoud, leader of the Northern Alliance, who was friendly with the CIA and fighting the Taliban. 'Even if he agreed to do so, his chances of success against the Taliban were judged to be less than five percent,' the report said. Al-Qaeda operatives killed Massoud on September 9, 2001. President Bill Clinton was criticised for not doing more to catch Bin Laden. But the documents show it wouldn't have been an easy task, though some at the CIA were still hopeful they could get him. 'The odds of success are iffy,' Michael Scheuer, who ran the CIA's bin Laden unit, said in a 1998 secret memo that was among the declassified documents released Tuesday. 'And the thing could blow up at any point along the way.' It would take the U.S. government another 13 years to catch and kill Bin Laden.","Complaints that intelligence agency's hunt was underfunded revealed in new documents .

Britain's biggest union is plotting to cripple the country with the first general strike for nearly 90 years. In a move that it privately admits is ‘explicitly political’, Unite will meet other unions later this month to discuss a co-ordinated nationwide industrial walkout. Leaked papers from the union, which has 1.5million members, describe a general strike as a ‘desirable’ protest at the Government’s austerity drive, including the recent changes to benefits. Strike! Unions have proposed plans for a general walkout by workers from across the country (file photo) Previous protest: Public sector workers attend a rally in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in November 2011, as workers around the country staged the biggest general strike for decades in a row over pensions . Last night fellow union, Unison, . which has 1.3million members, said it would back proposals for a general . strike as long as it was the end, not the beginning, of a protest . campaign. The leaking of Unite’s explosive plans comes as its members are voting to elect a new leader. Current general secretary Len . McCluskey – nicknamed ‘Red Len’ – is opposed in the ballot by one other . candidate, Jerry Hicks, who is backed by the Socialist Workers’ Party. A result is expected on April 15, and a meeting about a general strike is due at the Trades Union Congress HQ nine days later. Historic: The last general strike came in 1926 following a dispute over coal miners' pay . Travel chaos: An archive photograph taken during the General Strike of May 1926 shows City workers crossing London Bridge after walking from their homes owing to the suspension of public transport services . The Conservatives are calling on . Labour leader Ed Miliband, whose biggest backer is Unite, to stop taking . cash from the union until it withdraws the strike threat. 'Labour's single biggest union paymaster is threatening British businesses and hard-working people with mass strikes' Conservative chairman Grant Shapps . Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps . said: ‘Labour’s single biggest union paymaster is threatening British . businesses and hardworking people with mass strikes. ‘Ed Miliband must refuse to take a . single penny more of his union paymaster’s cash until Len McCluskey . withdraws Unite’s threat to sabotage our economy.’ Since Mr McCluskey became leader in . September 2010, Unite  has donated £8.4million to the Labour Party, . according to the Electoral Commission. Dilemma: Ed Miliband faces calls to reject further funding from Unite, led by hardliner Len McCluskey, right . Previous strike: An archive photo from February 1979 of the rising mound of rubbish in Leicester Square, central London, during what became known as the Winter of Discontent . The threat of co-ordinated industrial . action comes after unions voted overwhelmingly last September to start . planning the ‘practicalities’ of the first general strike  since 1926. Britain's previous general strike came in May 1926 following a dispute over reduced wages for coal miners. After the miners (right) were locked out from work, the TUC called on its 1.7million members to walk out of their jobs in solidarity. Last-minute . negotiations with prime minister Stanley Baldwin's government were called off after . the Daily Mail's printers refused to print an editorial criticising the . proposed strike as a 'revolutionary move'. The workers participating in the general strike included railway workers, dockers and steelworkers. Thousands . of volunteers and special constables tried to replace the lost labour, . and after nine days the TUC admitted defeat and called off the action. Then from 1978 to 1979, the Winter of Discontent saw a public sector strike under Lord Callaghan's Government, which resulted in power cuts and piles of rubbish on streets. The strikes, which called for bigger pay rises, had even seen gravediggers join picket lines and leave dead bodies waiting to be buried. If it goes ahead, a general strike . would wipe out vital services, with workers from teachers to prison . guards, firemen to nurses, dinner ladies to paramedics likely to walk . out. But such a move is strongly opposed . by more moderate unions, who fear it would be impossible to organise and . would fuel resentment among the public due to the chaos it would cause. Yesterday Mike Clancy, general . secretary of Prospect, which represents professionals such as engineers . and scientists, said: ‘Whilst an understandable reaction to austerity . and failing Coalition  policies, talk of a general strike is a dangerous . distraction, allowing the Government to shift attention from its own . problems.’ At last year’s TUC, Jim McAuslan, . general secretary of Balpa, the airline pilots’ union, warned: ‘It won’t . work. Worse, it will give our opponents a stick to beat us with.’ A Unison spokesman said yesterday: ‘A . general strike? In principle, yes, we would support that provided there . was a legitimate trade dispute and it was legal. ‘We believe that a general strike can only be the culmination of a campaign, not the beginning of a campaign.’ The Public and Commercial  Services . union, whose members are taking strike action today, is also keen to . co-ordinate industrial action for maximum effect. ‘If we as a union movement are . serious about opposing what the  Government is doing, then clearly the . best weapon at our disposal is industrial action,’ a spokesman said. ‘The best way to deploy that weapon is co-ordinated action.'","Unite plan to call 'political' general strike is backed in principle by Unison .

The body of a county commissioner was found floating in a marina one mile from his home on an island off the coast of Georgia, with his hands bound and a gunshot to his head. Police originally ruled the case a homicide but as the search for Tom Sublett's killer has now been going on for nearly one month, the prospect of it being a fully-staged suicide is now being seriously considered. Though many aspects of the case- like the way his body was ditched, the fact the autopsy said he drowned rather than dying from the gunshot wound in his head, and the bloodstains in the trunk of his abandoned car- point to murder, many who knew Tom Sublett say that they have no idea who would have wanted him dead. Scroll down for video . Missing: Tom Sublett, 52, was reported missing by his wife Carol (right) when he had not come home by 2.30am following his weekly poker game the night before . Family: Sublett is survived by his daughters Erin (left) and Leslie Sublett Gordy (right) as well has his two sons Grant and Reid . Mr Sublett, 52, was a married father of four and in the final months of his term as the County Commissioner. He went missing on the night of Monday December 11, following his regular poker game at a friend's house in a town called Sterling, about a half hour drive from St Simons. His wife became concerned when he hadn't arrived home by 2.30am and she called the friends that her husband had been playing cards with earlier in the evening. One of the men drove along the route that Mr Sublett typically takes home from the games and he discovered the abandoned car at 4am. Two hours later, another friend that was helping in the search checked the docks of the St. Simons Boating & Fishing Club. There he found Sublett's barely-visible body floating in the water. Timeline: After leaving his poker game in Sterling, the drive should have only taken about 30 minutes to get back to his home on St Simons Island but he never returned . The marina is nearly one mile away from Mr Sublett's home, which real estate site Zillow values at $998,241. Police chief Matt Doering told the Florida Times-Union that they have not found anyone who has seen Sublett in between 10.30pm Monday night when he left the poker game and the time that his friend found his body in the early morning on Tuesday. Several key pieces of information have not been released by police. They say that several personal items were missing from Mr Sublett's car but they have not disclosed what those items were. One thing they have ruled out is his wallet, however, as Mr Doering said that he was the one to collect that at the scene. Transfers: Sublett (center right)- seen here with his daughter in law Kathryn Sublett (left), son Reid (center left), and younger son Grant (right)- was originally from Virginia but moved to St Simons Island in Georgia in the 1990s . Unexpected: The 52-year-old grandfather- seen here with Erin (left), Kathryn (center right) and Reid (right)- had no known enemies, making the search for any possible suspects more difficult . Friends and colleagues are shocked that anyone would want to murder the mild-mannered realtor-turned-local official, adding to speculation that perhaps it was suicide. Because of that possibility- which other friends dismiss out of hand, saying that there were no signs that Mr Sublett was depressed or had any intention of killing himself- people are curious about the angle of the shot. Work: Mr Sublett was resigning as a county commissioner in the coming months to spend more time working on his real estate business . If Mr Sublett shot himself while his hands were bound, the bullet would have likely come from the bottom of his head, closer to his chin, as opposed to if he was shot by someone standing perhaps above him. Another problem for police: they still haven't found the gun. 'You name it... there are all sorts of theories,' local resident Elden Carmichael told The Atlanta Journal Constitution. As the search for a suspect is about to be one month old, investigators are beginning to look more closely at signs that the death could have been staged. One of the things they are revealing to have found in the abandoned car was an empty bottles of prescription medication that belonged to Mr Sublett and his wife. They are still waiting on toxicology reports to determine whether or not Mr Sublett had ingested any of the pills, as a suicide would be more likely if he had taken some of those drugs before killing himself. The obvious signs prompted police to rule the case a homicide immediately after Mr Sublett was found. That has produced few leads, however, as no friends can suggest no possible enemies for Mr Subless who they called a 'jokester'. His wife Carol has not spoken publicly since the incident and neither have his four children- his daughters Kathryn and Erin and sons Grant and Reid. He is also survived by two grandchildren. He is also known for being honest and willing to compromise when it came to his work. The Commission chairman Richard Strickland said to the Florida Times-Union that Mr Sublett 'was probably one of the greatest community leaders I can recall' and also counted him as a 'good friend and a great family man'. The only contested decision that investigators have looked into from his time as commissioner was one to fight a proposed jail expansion. Mr Sublett was against the idea of building a new jail in Brunswick, which is just on the mainland and not far from St. Simons Island, and though the debate was heated according to The Atlanta Journal Constitution, his side did win in the end and the jail was built elsewhere. As the case is still officially ruled a homicide, some of Mr Sublett's colleagues fear that they may be next. 'All the commissioners have had a second thought about this thing,' fellow commissioner Bob Coleman told the Journal Constitution. 'I try not to get myself backed up in a corner somewhere. I avoid dark parking lots. When I walk outside my business, I look both ways.'","County commissioner Tom Sublett, 52, was found dead floating in a marina near his home in St Simons Island off the coast of Georgia .

It's an age old tradition on the streets of Catalonia in Spain, but not one that the average Londoner expects to see on their lunch break. More than 170 members of the Human Towers de Vilafranca team clambered on top of one another to make their UK debut this afternoon in an attempt to build a living structure to rival Tower Bridge. Not a hobby likely to endear itself to health and safety officials, the stunt saw members of the team - men, women and children of all ages and sizes - climb barefoot on the shoulders of their colleagues reaching higher and higher. Scroll down for video . Impressive stunt: Members, or castellers, from the Human Towers de Vilafranca team pictured building, left, and completing, right, the UK's first 'human tower' - a Catalan tradition . Going up: Members of the team form successively smaller tiers by climbing up the bodies of each layer to mount the shoulders of the previous tier until the tower is complete . Sometimes the towers collapse, but on this occasion the final member of the team managed to reach the pinnacle and triumphantly raise a fist in the air. The tradition of building human towers, known as Castells has been a popular custom in Spain for more than 300 years and is a mainstay of summer festivals around the Mediterranean, most specifically in Barcelona and the Catalonia area. The bizarre pastime has its roots in aerial dance moves performed at religious festivals centuries ago. It originated in Valis, near the city of Tarragona, in the southern part of Catalonia in the 18th century and spread throughout the region in the years that followed. The base of the living structure, known as the Pinya, is usually made up of four men who act as a form of safety net and cushion the fall of those above them if things go wrong. Hold on tight: Castellers cling on to each other as they build the top tiers of the human tower . Reaching the top: The final stages of the tower begin to take shape as it appears to dwarf nearbyTower Bridge . Those who are part of the Pinya have to be strong - they can sometimes bear 770lbs on their shoulders. Castellers, as they are known, then form other levels and the top level is complete when the final climber, usually a small shild known as the enxaneta, reaches their position and puts one hand in the air. Stages of assembly and disassembly should by completed without stopping. Towers can reach up to 10 levels high. The practice was declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage by Unesco in 2010 and teams compete at competitions between April and September each year. Pinnacle: The top level is complete when the final climber, usually a small shild known as the enxaneta, reaches their position and puts one hand in the air . The tradition is kept alive by some 7,000 castellers who belong to 66 different teams. As well as performing close to London Bridge, the Human Towers de Vilafranca team also showcased their talents in Moorgate and will perform at Clapham Common, the Millennium Bridge in Southwark and Borough Market throughout the weekend. The group performed their daring stunt on top of a building in Manhattan last summer to commemorate the ongoing rebuilding of the World Trade Center.","The Human Towers de Vilafranca built the UK's first human tower .

The family of a British tourist who drowned in strong currents off the Italian coast have questioned why a red flag was not raised to warn against swimming in that area. Brian Kent, 45, was dragged under the water when he went for a mid-afternoon dip in the sea with his wife, Sally, yesterday afternoon. His family today said no life-guard was on duty and there was nothing to suggest conditions were treacherous on that stretch of the beach. Dangerous currents: Witnesses said Mr Kent got into difficulties in the sea in front of the beachside Hotel Aurora (stock photo) His sister-in-law Nicola Phillips said relatives had been looking forward to the day trip to the seaside town of Sperlonga, which came on the family holiday to Rome. She today paid tribute to the 'incredible husband and father' who would be 'sorely missed by everyone'. 'We had all looked forward to our trip to Rome and googled the spectacular beaches of Sperlonga,' Ms Phillips said. 'After arriving we ate lunch and Brian had a pizza and one glass of beer. He waited 30-40 minutes before going into the sea. There was no red flag, and later we found out no life guard on duty.' She said this meant the family 'completely underestimated' the undercurrent which 'proved to be a fatal error'. The strong swimmer was said to have been overcome by the waves minutes after jumping into the water. His wife was pulled from the sea by her two sons, Connor and Aaron but efforts to save Mr Kent failed. Tourism hotspot: Sperlonga is about an hour and a half south of Rome and is a popular beach resort . Ms Phillips said: 'Sally's son Connor . and his brother Aaron managed to pull Sally safely to shore and two . unnamed persons eventually found Brian. But we believe it was already . too late. 'Members of the family, passers-by . and eventually the ambulance tried in vain to resuscitate him. Brian was . a strong swimmer, as were other members of the party, but a tragic . accident occurred. 'My sister and their children would like to come to terms with this without the need to defend decisions that were made that day. Many thanks goes to everybody who helped, particularly the staff of the Aurora Hotel.' A woman, who did not give her name, said she had been at work in a hotel when a number of panicked tourists rushed in. 'I was in the reception when people burst in to call for help,' she said. 'They said someone was in trouble in the water and we called an ambulance immediately. 'I went outside and could see the man in the water. One of his sons was trying to rescue him but I think it was already too late. It was very sad.' Tragic: Mr Kent drowned after visiting the beach at Sperlonga, Italy (stock photo) Mirella Gagliardi, owner of the Hotel . Aurora, said: 'It all happened right in front of our hotel. The man who . died had arrived with his wife and group of other British people in the . morning to spend the day by the sea. 'They had a very late lunch and ate . and drank quite a bit, then they decided to go for a swim. 'The sea was rough - it wasn't the right sort . of day to go into the water. 'He . hit problems right away and was dragged under by the currents and the . waves, the sea was rough but I think the fact he had just had an . abundant lunch probably didn't help either. 'His wife and some of the . others were also in difficulty but they managed to get out of the water. 'It all happened in front of his poor wife. She was in a very bad way, very shocked.' A coastguard helicopter was scrambled to the scene and paramedics were also dispatched but Mr Kent was declared dead at the scene and his body taken to the mortuary of a local hospital. The group, all from London, spent the night in the Aurora hotel, while arrangements were made to repatriate Mr Kent's body after a local magistrate gave the go ahead for it to be released. They are expected back in Britain today. Holiday: The group had enjoyed a large lunch at a taverna in Sperlonga before headed to the beach (stock photo) Stefano De Stefano, owner of the Taverna . di Ulisse restaurant, where the party had lunch said: 'It was such a . tragic end to what should have been a beautiful day by the sea. They had . come in here for lunch and had pizza and beers and they were all . laughing and joking. 'There must have been around ten of them . all together, all men and women and there was a little girl as well. They were here for an hour, maybe more then they all went off to the . beach. The weather was nice but the sea was rough, the waves were high . and there was a strong wind as well. 'The first we knew something had happened was a few minutes later when we heard all the noise, looked outside and saw the ambulance and the helicopter on the beach. The man was on the sand and they were pumping his chest but sadly there was nothing that could be done. 'The area doesn't have a lifeguard and it's still early in the season and it happened midweek. If it was the summer there would have been a guard nearby. He must have been hit by a cramp after going in the water so soon after lunch.' A police spokesman in nearby Gaeta said: 'We were called to the scene and arrived along with paramedics and the coastguard, to a man who had got into difficulties in the sea. He was pulled from the water and cardiac massage was carried out but there was nothing that could be done. 'His body was taken to a local hospital and his family spent the night in the hotel.

The boy is the son of notorious former city councilman Charles Wingate, 43, who was arrested on Thursday along with his wife of 17-years, Sharon Starkey on charges of of child abuse. Police say they responded to a neighbor's 'check the welfare' call at 6120 Corinth Drive around noon and the door was answered by the boy who was naked, alone and sharing the home with dead and living rodents. Charles Wingate and his wife Sharon Starkey (right) have been arrested on charges of child abuse after their 13-year-old son was discovered naked and covered in rat feces at their Colorado Springs home . Filthy: This is the Colorado Springs home where the 13 year old boy of Charles Wingate and Sharon Starkey was discovered and taken into protective custody . The unidentified teen told police . that he is an only child, has been home schooled and does not ever . remember being outside his house - while neighbors said they have not . seen the child in several years. He was taken to a local hospital and then released into the custody of the Department of Human Services.

Police have smashed a suspected Russian prostitution gang run from luxury flats in Chelsea which generated up to £20,000 a day. Six people have been arrested after Scotland Yard carried out dawn raids on 13 properties including a gated estate behind Chelsea FC's ground Stamford Bridge. Nine Eastern European women, who police say were trafficked and forced into prostitution, were rescued and are now being looked after in care centres. Raids: Police visited a block of nine flats on Warwick Road in Chelsea where the operation was believed to have been based . A 44-year-old woman, said to be the madam of the Russian brothel, was arrested at an address in Brompton Park Crescent (pictured) The racket, believed to have links to the Russian mafia, was run from a block of nine flats on . Warwick Road in Chelsea which the group rented and operated as a brothel. Women were 'recruited' from Eastern Europe and promised jobs in the leisure industry working in posts such as receptionists at hotels. But once in the UK they were forced to work as prostitutes and told their families would be harmed if they refused. Detectives also seized £75,000 in cash today from two of the suspects' addresses. The suspected ringleader is a 44-year-old Russian brothel madam who was arrested at an address on the luxury Brompton Park Crescent estate in Chelsea. Arrests were also made at several other luxury addresses in west London including Chelsea Harbour and a gated estate behind Stamford Bridge football ground. Officers from Scotland Yard’s Human Trafficking and Prostitution Unit closed in on the gang after watching them for 12 weeks. The gang were said to have operated a sophisticated operation which included advertising, a website, enforcers and an accountant. Detective Inspector Kevin Hyland, of the Human Trafficking and Prostitution Unit, said: 'This was organised and run on the lines of a business with elements that arranged the recruitment in eastern Europe, the advertising and the website and the accounting. Raids: Scotland Yard says it has cracked a Russian prostitution gang after making six arrests in Chelsea . 'We have targeted an organised group of criminals who have been profiting from the abuse of scores of women. 'This operation is in part a result of victims having the courage to come forward about the abuse they are suffering. I urge other victims of trafficking to phone our hotline where we have translators and specially trained staff awaiting their call. ' Three of the Russian nationals were in the UK illegally. Following the raids the nine women, from Russia, Bulgaria and Latvia, have been taken to a care centre to be looked after. Five people were arrested on trafficking, controlling prostitution and money laundering offences. These included two women from Chelsea, aged 44 and 33, a 31-year-old woman from Fulham, a 27-year-old man from Palmers Green and a 30-year-old woman from Palmers Green. A sixth person - a 37 year-old man from Beckton - was also arrested in Essex. All are currently in custody at a west London police station.

Order of service: Lady Thatcher will have her funeral service led by her friend the Bishop of London . Margaret Thatcher’s funeral service will be dominated by movingly patriotic selections of music and verse, chosen by the former Prime Minister herself. The service, conducted by the Bishop of London, the Right Rev Richard Chartres – a long-standing friend of Lady Thatcher – will reflect her public love of her country and her private literary tastes. Lady Thatcher’s coat of arms is on the front page of the Order of Service, as granted following her elevation to the peerage in 1992. Underneath are the words ‘Cherish Freedom’, her motto. On the second page is the poem Little Gidding, by T. S. Eliot, written at the height of the Blitz in 1941. The poet was a particular favourite of Lady Thatcher. What we call the beginning is often the endAnd to make an end is to make a beginning.The end is where we start from.We die with the dying:See, they depart, and we go with them.We are born with the dead:See, they return, and bring us with them.The moment of the rose and the moment of the yew-treeAre of equal duration. A people without historyIs not redeemed from time, for history is a patternOf timeless moments. So, while the light failsOn a winter’s afternoon, in a secluded chapelHistory is now and England.With the drawing of this Love and the voice of this CallingWe shall not cease from explorationAnd the end of all our exploringWill be to arrive where we startedAnd know the place for the first time.A single half-muffled bell will toll as the cortege arrives. The half-muffled sound is used for a mournful effect: traditionally, bells are only fully muffled on the death of the sovereign, incumbent vicar or bishop. The St Paul’s Cathedral Guild of Ringers will ring using a technique known as ‘Stedman Cinques’ for 30 minutes. Lady Thatcher’s coffin will be borne by a bearer party made up of personnel from Army, Navy and RAF units that served in the Falklands. The west steps of the cathedral will be lined by pensioners of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, which Lady Thatcher frequently attended during her final years. Guests will file in to the strains of late-Victorian British composers. Lady Thatcher expressly requested that the service should be ‘framed’ by traditional British music and it will include: . Meditation on John Keble’s Rogationtide Hymn, by John Ireland; Psalm-Prelude (Set 2, No 1), Herbert Howells; Allegro maestoso and Andante espressivo from Sonata in G major, Edward Elgar; Adagio in E major from Three Pieces for Organ, Frank Bridge; Fantasia and Toccata, Charles Villiers Stanford; Master Tallis’s Testament from Six Pieces for Organ, Herbert Howells; Toccata and Fugue ‘The Wanderer’, Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry; Rhosymedre from Three Preludes founded on Welsh Hymn Tunes, Ralph Vaughan Williams; Elegy, Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry.

We recall with great gratitude her leadership of this nation, her courage, her steadfastness, and her resolve to accomplish what she believed to be right for the common good. We remember the values by which she lived, the ideals she embraced, her dignity, her diligence, her courtesy, and her personal concern for the wellbeing of individuals. And as we remember, so we rejoice in the lifelong companionship she enjoyed with Denis, and we pray for her family and friends and for all who mourn her passing. We continue to pray for this nation, giving thanks for its traditions of freedom, for the rule of law and for parliamentary democracy; remembering the part we have played in peace and conflict over many centuries and in all parts of the world; praying for all today who suffer and sorrow in sickness, poverty, oppression or despair, that in harmony and truth we may seek to be channels of Christ’s faith, hope and compassion to all the world; joining our prayers together as we say:The Lord’s PrayerHymn: He Who Would Valiant Be – John Bunyan and Percy Dearmerl A favourite from her childhood that chimed with her political philosophy.

Accused: A disciplinary hearing was told Dr Rajat Banerjee was seen 'asleep in a chair' after giving a patient a spinal injection during a major operation . An anaesthetist slept in a chair as his patient lay on the operating table giving birth, a hearing was told. Dr Rajat Subhra Banerjee was seen with his eyes shut, arms folded, head on chest in an adjacent room, it is claimed. A midwife said she had never seen an anaesthetist leave a patient in her 14 years working at Royal Bolton Hospital. Caroline Finch said: 'I remember glancing into the anaesthetics room. He had his arms folded, chin on chest and legs outstretched. 'The door was slightly opened and I could see right into it. From his appearance he looked like he was asleep to me.' She went over to a colleague and said: 'Just come and have a look and tell me what you think.' Dr Banerjee had given the patient a spinal injection before a caesarean was carried out. During the operation her blood pressure dropped and he was called back in to administer further drugs, but then immediately left. Miss Finch added: 'I felt that when I have got a lady on the treatment table he should be with that lady. 'He should not ever leave that lady. He appeared to be asleep when we had a lady on the table having major surgery.' Miss Finch observed Banerjee in the position on three occasions over a period of around ten minutes, the panel heard. She added: 'In all my time of being a midwife I have never known an anaesthetist leave a lady on the treatment table for the amount of time Dr Banerjee did.' Dr Banerjee was working at Royal Bolton Hospital at the time of the incident . The incident is said to have occurred on the May 22, 2009 and the doctor is also charged with falling asleep after administering an anaesthetic on May 16, 2009. Consultant anaesthetist Wyn Price claimed Banerjee had told him he was 'unwell' on one of the occasions when he apparently drifted off. 'He mentioned not being that well during the day,' said Mr Price. On another occasion Banerjee failed to administer enough anaesthetic, risking the patient waking up during an operation. 'He was not as deeply anaesthetised as appropriate,' said Mr Price. 'In this case it was a short period, not enough for the patient to wake up, but it could have gone further if not highlighted.' Dr Banerjee also claimed to have taken study leave to attend medical courses which he did not go to in 2006. After hearing the evidence, the panel, which sat in Manchester, opted not to restrict him from practising in his current position at Fairfield Hospital in Bury, Greater Manchester, as his previous misconduct had been 'remedied'. Dr Banjerjee claimed to have been a victim of bullying and racial discrimination during his employment at St Helens and Knowsley NHS Trust. According to The Bury Times, the doctor has worked at a number of hospitals, including Stepping Hill and Mid Staffordshire, before joining Royal Bolton Hospital. He now works at Fairfield Hospital. Chairman of the panel Dr Malcolm Phillips said: 'The panel does not consider that your conduct fell just below the threshold for a finding of impaired fitness to practise; it considers that it fell some way below that threshold. 'The panel accepts that warnings should be viewed as a deterrent to remind the doctor that his conduct fell below the required standards.' The panel found the doctor put patients at 'unwarranted risk of harm' between three and eight years ago, but heard there had been no further complaints and Dr Banerjee has since changed his practice.

Four years later, the family moved again when David signed for LA Galaxy based in the United States in a five-year deal. There was speculation that the move would put an end to Beckham's England career, but in a bid to prove his continued commitment to international football he returned to Europe with two loan spells at AC Milan during the off-season. In recent years the couple have been increasingly based back in London, with David training sporadically with Arsenal. In January the 38-year-old announced he would be joining Paris St Germain in a five-month loan deal. However, the Beckham brood remained in London as the children had started new schools. After announcing his retirement, David will now be hoping to see more of Victoria and their four children Brooklyn, Romeo, Harper and Cruz.","Says family are 'excited about the next chapter in our lives'

Investigators are examining Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev's visit to Dagestan in Russia's turbulent Caucasus region . Investigators are examining whether Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev was influenced by a distant cousin with ties to extremist Islamist groups in Russia. Magomed Kartashov is founder and leader of a group called The Union of the Just which reportedly promotes the application of Islamic Sharia law and has protested against the United States. Tsarnaev is said to have met Kartashov for the first time when he spent six month's in Dagestan, Russia's turbulent Caucasus region, last year. Tsarnaev’s mother Zubeidat told TIME Magazine that the two 'became very close.' The Union of the Just publicly renounces violence, but several of its members have ties to militants. A lawyer for Kartashov confirmed to ABC News that Russian security agents recently interviewed her client about his links to Tsarnaev. Kartashov admits that the two were close but insists that it was Tsarnaev who tried to 'pull him into extremism'. Kartashov is currently in jail on charges of resisting police in an unrelated matter. His lawyer expects he will remain there for at least two more months. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed during a violent standoff with police on April 19, days after he and his brother Dzhokhar, 19, allegedly planted homemade bombs at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured alive and has been charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. He faces the death penalty. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, the mother of Tamerlan, confirmed her son met with Kartashov and the two became 'very close' Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsaernaev are accused of carrying out the Bostom bombing attack which killed three people and injured hundreds . Ever since the attack, investigators have been trying to understand how the brothers would have become radicalised to the point of wanting to kill and maim people in the U.S., the country they called home. Much of the focus has been on Tamerlan Tsarnaev's six-month visit to Dagestan, a restive region in southern Russia that is home to an Islamist militant insurgency. They want to know if and how Tamerlan attempted to join militant groups there. Tamerlan's brother Dzhokar Tsarnaev was captured alive and has been charged with terrorism offences . Earlier, a U.S. official confirmed to . ABC News that investigators are also looking into Tamerlan's contacts . with a young militant named Mahmud Mansur Nidal. The . two were reportedly seen leaving a controversial Salafist mosque in the . capital of Makhachkala that has been popular with militants over the . years. They also want to know about possible . contacts with a Canadian-Russian militant named William Plonikov, who . was killed in a police shootout last July, just days before Tamerlan . suddenly left the country. The body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev was entombed in an unknown gravesite yesterday after police said an anonymous person stepped forward to help arrange the secret burial. The burial ended a weeklong search for a place willing to take Tsarnaev's body out of Worcester, where his remains had been stored at a funeral home amid protests. In that time, the cities where Tsarnaev lived and died and his mother's country all refused the remains. Amid the frustration, Worcester's police chief urged an end to the quandary. 'We are not barbarians,' he said. 'We bury the dead.' By Thursday, police announced: 'As a result of our public appeal for help, a courageous and compassionate individual came forward to provide the assistance needed to properly bury the deceased.'","Tamerlan Tsarnaev met Magomed Kartashov in turbulent Caucasus region .

As a young midfielder, Marcus Urban was seen as a rising star of the game when he played for the East German national youth team in the 1980s. But he was constantly terrified of being 'outed' as homosexual and decided not to pursue the profession any further. 'Painful': Marcus Urban said he felt unable to continue his career as a footballer because he felt under constant pressure to hide the fact he was gay . Urban described the experience of living a double life as 'unbearable'. 'I hid 24 hours a day, I . adjusted,' he told CNN. 'It was an almost unbearable pain, . a great sacrifice, a painful price to pay to achieve my goal of . becoming a professional footballer.' Urban began playing football in 1978, when he joined East German club Motor Weimar at the age of seven before moving to Rot-Weiss Erfurt in 1984. He trained twice a day with his new team and was being talked up as potential player for the German national team, winning a youth championship with Rot-Weiss in 1985. He was called up to East Germany's youth team in 1986 and played alongside or against . future German national team stars including Robert Enke, Bernd Schneider and . Thomas Linke.

Urban went on to make over 100 appearances for Rot-Weiss' senior team in the German second division. But his spell in Erfurt proved to be the peak of a career cut short by fear and insecurity. 'By my early 20s I was burned out,' he said. 'I realized that if I became a professional footballer, I would suffer as a man. I chose freedom over a constructed prison. 'Talent is not enough. You need the will, physical fitness, good luck and a tough mentality. But what if you hide 24 hours a day because you are gay?' Urban finally told his story in the book 'Versteckspieler: Die Geschichte des schwulen Fußballers Marcus Urban' - 'Hidden Player: the story of the gay footballer Marcus Urban'. The biography, written by Ronny Blaschke, is in the process of being turned into a feature film. In contrast, to many other sports, there are currently no openly gay footballers in British football leagues. But the tide is beginning to change and many believe it is only a matter of time before a player comes out.

A woman branded morbidly obese by her GP has lost 21 stone in weight after an embarrassing trip to the dentists forced her to act. Denise Petty has gone from a size 34 to a size 14 dress after four years of shedding the pounds. She has lost so much weight, doctors told her last year a gastric band she had fitted was no longer working and she had been keeping the weight off herself. Struggling with her weight: Denise Petty, 42, weighed 36 stone in 2009 and could not go upstairs without struggling for breath . It took a trip to the dentist to spark the mother-of-one from Walsall, West Midlands, into action. Miss Petty said: 'It was just so embarrassing. I went to the dentists and they could not get the chair to lift me up. 'I knew then that if I didn’t do something about my weight I would be lucky to survive to the end of the year.' At the time in 2009, she weighed 36 stone and could not get up the stairs in her house without struggling for breath. She said she was depressed after years of weight gain and never allowed anyone to take photographs of her. 'The weight creeps up on you, year after year,' said Miss Petty. When she plucked up the courage to go to her GP, he warned her she was morbidly obese but it took the shock of what happened at the dentists to force a change of lifestyle. Result: The moment a dentist's chair could not lift Denise inspired her to take drastic action . She said: 'I couldn’t walk more than 20 yards. I avoided the GP because he always said the same thing, that I was morbidly obese, and you don’t want to listen, you don’t want to hear it. 'But it changed my mind and I knew I had to lose weight.' The 42-year-old health care assistant was referred by her GP to her local Weight Watchers group in Bloxwich, where she said she learned to 're-educate' herself about food and change her lifestyle. 'It’s about smaller portion sizes and about moderating what you eat,' she said. 'It does get harder to lose the weight and to keep the weight off - the temptations never go away. 'But when I go to my group, I can talk to the others, we can have a giggle and people understand your issues, which has been a great help to me.' With the support of her family, she also took the step of having gastric band surgery at the Birmingham Heartlands hospital. 'We thought long and hard about the risks because there was a chance I might die while in surgery, but I felt that if I didn’t do something I would be dead anyway,' Miss Petty added. Two years later, her weight loss regime had been so successful she was told her gastric band had 'stopped working' some months before and that she had been losing the weight by herself. Now, she can walk her dog without fighting for breath and is taking her driving test next month. She is also thinking about getting on an aeroplane to take a holiday abroad. 'I never wanted to face the embarrassment of thinking I wouldn’t fit in one of the plane’s seats and now I just don’t have that worry,' she said. Success: After joining her local Weight Watchers group, Denise Petty cut down her portion sizes and said she had to 're-educate' herself about food . Miss Petty added: 'I found some of my clothes from before and could not imagine me filling them - they used to be quite tight on me. That is a great feeling to have.' Having reduced her body weight by more than half, Miss Petty now wants to lose another 10 lbs so she can qualify for surgery to remove the excess skin her slimming has left behind. Beverley Longsden, Weight Watchers group leader, said Miss Petty was 'amazing'. 'I’ve never had anybody who has lost that much weight,' she said. 'She knew she had got to lose the weight and she also realised she could not do it alone. 'She has come each week for four years and that takes a lot because if you have a love of food it never goes away. 'It will always be an obstacle, trying to take you back to where you were. Weight Watchers is a tool to keep that under control.' She added: 'What you don’t realise is people just see your size and until you lose the weight they never see the person you really are. 'So I am so glad for Denise because she is such a witty, funny, wonderful person.'","Denise Petty, from Walsall, was so embarrassed she resolved to take action .

David Beckham’s move to play football in Paris has landed him in a row over taxes. The 37-year-old says he will receive just the minimum wage while the rest of his pay package is donated to charity. The deal means that high French taxes do not make a dent in his fortune while he plays for Paris St Germain. This has angered many French, including one MP who mocked Beckham’s accountant for saying the former England captain will work for only £2,000 a month. ‘He will be paid less than my parliamentary assistant!’ said conservative Gerald Darmanin. ‘Be serious!’ Controversy: David Beckham's deal with PSG - which means he will pay the vast majority of his salary to charity - has caused uproar among some French MPs . Deal: Under French law PSG must pay Beckham the minimum wage so that national insurance and other charges go the government . Beckham’s arrangement involves . limiting his contract to five months, keeping his family based in . London, and saying he will give his salary to charity. All of this . enables both Beckham and PSG to concentrate on making millions from the . ex-England captain’s image rights, while paying far less tax. The £2,000-a-month salary represents the minimum wage for professional footballers in France. Mr Darmanin added: ‘It is necessary to . convince the Sports Minister to stop this deadly tax process. I’d . rather receive 50 per cent of a lot than 75 per cent of nothing!’ Beckham will give about £700,000 a . month of wages to charity – but it is understood that PSG will pay this . direct, and not the player. This, along with the fact Beckham will . not live in France for longer than six months, ensures he will not . become liable for a 1.5 per cent tax on his worldwide income and . estimated wealth of £200million – a possible bill of £3million. Money-spinner: The deal doesn't prevent Beckham and PSG making money from his commercial rights with his shirts selling for around £100 . Jerome Guedj, a Socialist MP, insisted . that France would benefit in the long run from Beckham being in Paris. ‘Me, I see a symbol,' he said. 'He will create wealth around PSG, image . rights, jerseys sold by PSG. This is proof that the tax system in France . does not leak.’ Both Beckham and PSG will be able to make money from the ex-England captain’s image rights and other commercial activities. His share of merchandising rights is . likely to be paid into one of the three London-based companies. Footwork . Productions, which exploits Beckham’s name and image, including work . for Armani, Adidas, Samsung and Diet Coke, paid him nearly £86million in salary and dividends from 2002 to 2010. PSG is already promoting David Beckham shirts on . the club’s website, with an adult top featuring his name and number . costing almost £100. L’Equipe, the biggest sports paper . in the country, has already suggested that ‘football’s glamour icon’ was . little more than a money-spinning fairground attraction. It carried a . cartoon of the ‘S’ in PSG turned into a dollar sign last week, and . wrote: ‘With the signature of the Spice Boy David Beckham yesterday, PSG . pulled off a sensational publicity stunt.

The inquest into the death of poisoned spy Alexander Litvinenko could be scrapped and replaced with a public inquiry to allow evidence to be heard in secret. Coroner Sir Robert Owen ruled today that he cannot hear evidence on whether Mr Litvinenko's death could have been prevented, or any alleged links to the involvement of the Russian state, in public. Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina described the decision as a 'frightening precedent' and 'a tragedy for British justice.' Justice: The family of Alexander Litvinenko want his inquest to be held in public but a coroner has upheld an appeal by the UK Foreign Office for parts to be heard behind closed doors . Mr Litvinenko, 43, was poisoned with . radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in . London's Grosvenor Square in 2006. His family believes he was working for MI6 at the time and was killed on the orders of the Kremlin. Under fire: Foreign Secretary William Hague has been accused by Mr Litvinenko's family of putting trade with Russia before exposing the truth about his death . The coroner's ruling was published today after he accepted an application by the UK Foreign Office to keep certain information under wraps. Evidence cannot be heard in secret as part of an inquest, but could be as part of a public inquiry. Sir Robert said: 'It is my present view that I should hear submissions as to whether I should invite the Secretary of State (the Home Secretary) on behalf of Government to consider whether the power to hold an inquiry should be exercised in this case.' He said that the issues of preventability and Russian involvement are of 'central importance' to the investigation into Mr Litvinenko's death. Addressing the first issue, he said his duty to carry out 'a full, fair and fearless investigation' would be hampered if it was not included. He also said that excluding key evidence on the issue of Russian involvement would cause him 'grave concern'. The coroner went on: 'Were an inquiry to be held into the circumstances of Mr Litvinenko's death, the relevant material could be taken into account.' A statement from Mrs Litvinenko's solicitors said: 'This is a very sad day for Mrs Litvinenko, a tragedy for British justice which has until now been respected around the world, and it is frightening precedent for all of those, around the world, who have been trying so hard to expose the crimes committed by conspiracy of organised that operate from the Kremlin.' It added: 'Mrs Litvinenko is utterly dismayed by the Coroner's decision to abandon his search for the truth about Russian state responsibility for her husband's death. 'The effect of today's ruling is to protect those responsible for ordering the murder of a British citizen on the streets of London, and to allow the Russian government to shield behind a claim for secrecy made by William Hague with the backing of the Prime Minister David Cameron.' 'All those concerned with exposing the truth will be shocked and saddened that a political deal has been done between the two governments to prevent the truth from ever seeing the light of day.' The statement from Mrs Litvinenko's solicitors said they would now be pressing the coroner to order a full public inquiry as a matter of urgency as this is 'the only way now that the truth can be exposed' despite meaning secret evidence will be considered in a closed session. Alex Goldfarb, a friend of the . Litvinenko family and his widow Marina, said the decision was 'deeply . dismaying', and that it was 'upsetting' that in his view British . government had prioritised its political relationship with Russia over . the need to hold an open inquest. He . said: 'It appears the British government is more concerned about the . use of chemical weapons in Syria than radioactive weapons being used on . the streets of London.' However Mr Goldfarb added: 'On the other . hand, it's an admission by the British government that the Russian . state is culpable because otherwise they would not have requested . immunity. That in itself is a partial victory for Marina.'","Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned in London hotel in 2006 .

Jimmy Savile sexually abused four children when they were just five-years-old, three more than police previously claimed. The new horror was revealed in the Sunday Telegraph as it emerged five more celebrities are being probed as part of Operation Yewtree. Savile preyed on the youngsters between 1962 and 1976 in West Yorkshire, where he had a home. The revelations take his offending to a new level and also raise further questions over the conduct of West Yorkshire Police. Expanding: Operation Yewtree detectives are investigating five new celebrities in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal . The force had consistently maintained the disgraced entertainer had only targeted one victim of that age and published its findings in a 59-page report last week. But after repeated questioning, it yesterday admitted the document was 'slightly misleading' and admitted four victims were aged five. The force said the two of the victims had come forward last December and two earlier this year. But a previous joint report by the NSPCC and Scotland Yard, published on January 11, had previously said the youngest victim was eight. The latest twist in the case came as police began following a flood new complaints by both men and women against two singers, two TV personalities and a comedian, according to the Daily Mirror. Detectives from Operation Yewtree are now conducting fresh interviews across the country as the scale of the investigation grows ever larger. The new allegations are said to stretch back five decades. It is believed more victims are now coming forward in the wake of coverage of Savile's disgusting crimes. A source told the Mirror that Yewtree officers will 'leave no stone unturned' if people come forward with credible allegations. So far 12 people have been arrested . as part of the post-Savile inquiry, which is being run in three strands – . allegations against Savile, allegations involving Savile and others, . and allegations involving others. The . arrests include entertainers Rolf Harris, Freddie Starr and Jimmy . Tarbuck and disgraced pop star Gary Glitter. All deny any wrongdoing. Last month PR guru Max Clifford was charged with indecent assault . against teenage girls. The 70-year-old has been bailed to appear at Westminster Magistrate's Court on May 28 and has vowed to clear his name. Detectives have flown to Australia to interview a woman as part of the investigation into 83-year-old Harris. He has made no public statement on the arrest and has been bailed until a date in May. Jim Davidson, 59, was bailed again yesterday over an alleged sex offence. It emerged yesterday that Scotland Yard are also investigating claims he indecently assaulted a woman in the Falklands in the 1980s. PR guru Max Clifford has vowed to clear his name in court after being charged with 11 sex offences . Comedian Jim Davidson entertaining the troops in the Falkland Islands, where he has made seven visits over the years . Davidson was originally . arrested in January over alleged sex offences in the UK. The revelation . that the tentacles of Yewtree have now spread to the other side of the . world is likely to prompt renewed claims that the force is conducting a . celebrity witch-hunt. Critics . claim the inquiry has become a runaway train, with an ‘arrest first, . gather evidence later’ policy ruining the lives of celebrities. Yard . chiefs insist it is ‘fair and proportionate’. The Met investigation is being . carried out on behalf of the Royal Falkland Islands Police, which has . only 16 full-time officers. This is because British Police have no . jurisdiction in the Falklands, meaning they have no right to charge . people over offences there. A . file on the case will soon be sent to the Falklands’ Attorney General, . Mark Lewis, who will consult lawyers before deciding whether Davidson . should be prosecuted. If . Mr Lewis authorises charges, the five-times married comic will be . forced to travel 9,800 miles to the Falklands to stand trial. The . authorities in the Falklands, a British overseas territory, have the . power to ‘compel’ someone from the UK to appear in court in its capital, . Port Stanley. One official said that if Davidson were to be prosecuted . in the Falklands, it would be the ‘biggest thing to happen there the . since the war’. It is understood the woman, who claims she was indecently assaulted by Davidson, is not a resident. For legal reasons, the Mail cannot give details about her occupation at the time of the alleged attack. She . first contacted officers on Operation Yewtree with her allegations. They in turn alerted police in the Falklands.

Legal action: Dominique Strauss-Kahn is trying to get the kiss-and-tell novel Beauty and the Beast by his former mistress Marcela Iacub banned . Lawyers for Dominique Strauss-Kahn today tried to ban a book in which one of his former mistresses describes him as 'half man, half pig'. The kiss-and-tell novel by Marcela Iacub, a 49-year-old lawyer, recounts her seven-month affair with the former International Monetary Fund chief who wanted to be President of France. Mr Strauss-Kahn, 64, is furious that the book, called Beauty and the Beast and due out tomorrow, portrays him as a sex-mad love cheat. His barristers told a court at the Palais de Justice in Paris that he was 'horrified' at the novel, and wants it pulped because of 'violation of the intimacy of private life', and is seeking the equivalent of 88,000 pounds in damages. Ms Iacub said she met Mr Strauss-Kahn in Jan 2012 after coming out in his defence over the Nafissatou Diallo case, in which the New York hotel maid accused him of rape. Arrested in May 2011, Mr Strauss-Kahn was later cleared of criminal charges due to doubts over the maid's account. After Ms Iacub wrote an essay defending Mr Strauss-Kahn, he texted her: 'You who like writing, tell me what you want to do with me later.' There followed a seven-month affair in which Miss Iacub said she fell totally in love with 'the king of the pigs', writing: 'Pigs have a relationship with the present that humans hardly have. 'They never cease relishing the incredible luck of being alive, eating, running, sullying, wounding, feeling.' Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyers today also asked for £88,000 from Le Nouvel Observateur, the magazine, which has published extracts from the new book. If they succeed, it will be the first time a book has been banned in France since The Big Secret, the 1996 work by Francois Mitterrand's doctor which revealed the president had cancer while in office. Kiss-and-tell: Marcela Iacub had a seven-month affair with DSK and portrays him as a sex-mad love cheat . Beauty and Beast blames Anne Sinclair, Mr Strauss-Kahn's estranged wife, for encouraging him to pursue his career as a Socialist politician instead of getting him to control his sexual urges. 'You would have transformed the Elysee into a giant swingers' club,' Ms Iacub tells Mr Strauss Kahn in the book. 'You would have used your assistants, henchmen, advisers and staff as touts, orgy organisers, experts in the art of satisfying your darkest urges. 'You claimed that you were ready to give your blood for your country when in fact you would have used this country to spill your inexhaustible sperm.' Ms Iacub says Ms Sinclair, 64, dreamt of being first lady and thought she and her husband 'belonged to the caste of the masters of the world'. The case continues.

French prosecutors consider Zaid a key figure in the case because of an alleged bitter dispute with his brother over a family inheritance. He has, in turn, continually insisted that he is completely innocent of any wrong-doing, and said he had a good relationship with his brother. Their father, Kadhim Al-Hilli, died in Spain two years ago, leaving a number of properties and cash including the equivalent of some £800,000 in a bank account in Geneva, which is less than an hour's drive from the murder scene. Saad put a legal block on his father's will, effectively preventing Zaid from inheriting his share until 'unknown' disputes had been resolved, according to published legal documents. The French wanted to question Zaid over claims that he tried to use an expired credit card to withdrew cash from the Geneva account shortly before the killings. Saad kept a Taser stun gun protection weapon at his home in Claygate, Surrey, and had also changed the locks of the £1million property to prevent Zaid getting in. The scene of murder in the forest near Chevaline and Lake Annecy in the French Alps where Saad Al-Hilli, his wife Ikbal, her mother, Suhalia, and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier were killed (Policeman pictured lying down) Eric Maillaud, the Annecy prosecutor who is leading the investigation, has continually claimed that the key to solving the murder mystery 'lies abroad'. He has made no secret of his frustration at not being able to interview Zaid at length, but that situation changed when officers working directly for him arrived in the UK last week. According to a French police source, Zaid was asked to explain at length his 'whereabouts on the day of the tragedy.' He also offered information about the will, and about Saad's work as satellite technology engineer. Surrey police, who have to date released next to no information about the enquiry, confirmed that Zaid had been contacted. But they refused to provide any details about last week's questioning of Zaid, which was today being widely reported in the French media. 'We have regular contact with him as the next of kin of one of the victims,' said a Surrey Police spokesman. 'There is nothing more than that. He has never been arrested or considered a suspect'. Saad Al Hilli kept a Taser at his home in Claygate, Esher, Surrey and had changed the locks of the £1million property to prevent Zaid getting in . Saad's seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, suffered head injuries after being pistol whipped in the attack and was also shot in the shoulder. Her sister, Zeena, escaped unscathed after hiding under her mother's skirt in the back of the family BMW. Both girls are now in the hands of social services, with surviving members of the Al-Hilli family, including Zaid, only allowed limited access to them. There have been no arrests since the murders happened, with Mr Maillaud admitting that the baffling case 'may never be solved'. He recently ordered investigators to visit Iraq, which is where the Al-Hillis originally came from, but this has been delayed because of security worries.","Zaid Al-Hilli, 53, denies murdering his brother Saad and two family members .

Zaad Al-Hilli has been questioned by police over the death of his brother, Saad, who was shot dead in he French Alps. The brother of a British engineer murdered in the Alps alongside his family has been placed under armed guard after being questioned over the killing. Zaid Al-Hilli, 53, apparently has a panic alarm that summons police to his home when it is pressed, it emerged yesterday. The heavy security is believed to be provided by the Metropolitan Police and Surrey Police, with taxpayers footing the bill. Mr Al-Hilli was interviewedby French detectives on Friday close to his home in Chessington, Surrey. It comes almost seven months to the day since his 50-year-old brother, Saad Al-Hilli, died alongside his wife Ikbal, 47, and and Mrs Al-Hilli's mother, Suhalia, 74, in the family BMW. Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old French cyclist, also died in the September 5 bloodbath at a beauty spot near Lake Annecy, which is believed to have been carried out by at least one gunman brandishing a pistol. Prosecutors consider Zaid a key figure in the case because of an alleged bitter dispute with his brother over a family inheritance, though he denies any wrongdoing. He has not been arrested and is not considered a suspect by police. The Daily Telegraph revealed last night that his home in Britain is subject to special security measures, after police swooped on a reporter and photographer who knocked on Mr Al-Hilli's door. The armed officers arrived just moments after the journalists, and asked them what they were doing on the property. Mr Al-Hilli is said to have told British officials he fears for his life, but Surrey Police refused to confirm whether or not they are aware of a specific threat to the Iraqi-born Briton. A spokesman said yesterday: 'Around 1pm today two units from Surrey Police attended an address in Chessington alongside officers from the Metropolitan Police Service following a report of a disturbance at the location. 'Two men were spoken to but no offences were disclosed and no arrests were made.' Sources told the Telegraph that it was impossible to estimate the cost of the security operation, as the officers guarding Mr Al-Hilli's home are considered to be fulfilling their normal duties.

Pompous: Former president Nicholas Sarkozy said he may be forced to return to government because of a sense of duty 'for France' Nicholas Sarkozy styled himself as a Charles de Gaulle figure today - saying he may be forced to return to government because of a sense of duty 'for France'. In one of the most high-minded interviews of his career, the 58-year-old former President said he does not want to return to politics, but 'may be obliged to' because of the failure of the Socialist government which replaced his. Mr Sarkozy, who has been out of power since May last year, told the current affairs magazine Valeurs Actuelles: 'There may unfortunately be a moment when the question is no longer ""Do you feel like it?"" but ""Have you got a choice?"" 'In this this case I can no longer tell myself: ""I am happy, I take my daughter to school, and I take part in conferences around the world"". 'In which case, certainly, I will be forced to return. Not because I feel like it. Because of duty. Solely because it is France.' Mr Sarkozy, a right wing conservative, has often tried to evoke the spirit of General De Gaulle, the legendary Second World War leader who went on to lead France right up until the late 1960s. De Gaulle was consumed by a sense of duty for his homeland, regularly sacrificing personal ambitions for the good of his nation. But the diminutive Mr Sarkozy, 5ft 5ins, has never been viewed with anything like the same reverence as De Gaulle, a towering figure of 6ft 4ins who dominated post-war Europe.

Stepping down: Sarkozy and wife Carla Bruni leave the Elysee Palace as current president Francois Hollande and his partner Valerie Trierweiler look on .

This has made his claim that he now takes 'my daughter to school' sound an unlikely one. The Sarkozy's home was raided by anti-corruption police last year in connection with the so-called Bettencourt Affair.

Mr Sarkozy has denied any wrong doing, but has been made a 'material witness' in a criminal enquiry into the scandal. Other accusations include claims that he accepted millions of pounds worth of illegal cash from former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi. Mr Sarkozy lost his presidential immunity from prosecution when beaten by Socialist Francois Hollande in elections last May. Mr Hollande is himself now a deeply unpopular president, and is being held responsible for the economic recession blighting the country.","58-year-old former President styles himself as a Charles de Gaulle figure .

A tweet sent by Sally Bercow pointed the ‘finger of blame’ at a Tory peer, suggesting he was a sex offender, the High Court heard yesterday. The Speaker’s wife arrived at court in a revealing flowery dress and bright red shoes to hear lawyers argue over her message and whether it was defamatory. A Newsnight investigation aired  on November 2 last year accused a politician of allegedly abusing boys at a Welsh care home – but did not give a name. Two days later, the Speaker’s wife tweeted: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *Innocent face*’, in an apparent reference to a rumour he was the man involved. The former Conservative Party treasurer denied all the allegations and the alleged victim later retracted his account of life at Bryn Estyn care home in the 70s and 80s. Lord McAlpine threatened legal proceedings against those who he claimed had defamed him. He has already received six-figure payouts from the BBC and ITV. Bercow would not comment on the case, but denies libel and claims her tweet did not defame the peer as it was posed as an innocent question. Leading libel judge Mr Justice Tugendhat presided over the argument about the ‘natural and ordinary meaning’ and ‘innuendo’ of the tweet. Sir Edward Garnier QC, representing Lord McAlpine, said: ‘The tweet, by itself, suggests that “Lord McAlpine” has done something wrong . . . The inclusion of the words “innocent face” was giving a nudge and a wink to readers.’ He added: ‘What was the tweet about, if it was not pointing the finger of blame at Lord McAlpine?’ William McCormick QC, for Bercow, said it was ‘an entirely neutral statement’ and not ‘objectionable’. She was in the High Court today as a judge decides on the meaning of her allegedly libellous tweet about the furore. Sir Edward Garnier QC said it would be difficult to think of a more serious meaning than the one advanced by Lord McAlpine, who was not in court. He told Mr Justice Tugendhat that his case was founded on the circumstances in which Mrs Bercow decided to tweet the peer's name - the media frenzy over a story that spread 'like wildfire'. It was also necessary to consider the words themselves, in isolation. 'The tweet, by itself, suggests that ""Lord McAlpine"" has done something wrong. Drawing attention to someone and then adding the expression ""innocent face"" hints at wrongdoing and negates any suggestion that the tweet was a neutral query to which the defendant was looking for an answer. 'The inclusion of the words ""innocent face"" was giving a nudge and a wink to readers.' He said a user of Twitter was not someone who ignored what was happening in the world - he or she, far from being a hermit or shut off from the media, was inquisitive and IT literate. 'In short, there was a prominent and salacious story in the media, and what was missing was the name of the abuser at its centre.' Sir Edward said that, against the backdrop of almost saturation news coverage, Mrs Bercow  tweeted Lord McAlpine's name - a man who fitted the description of the unnamed person at the centre of the controversy. The addition of 'innocent face' underpinned the connection of him to wrongdoing and the hypothetical reasonable reader would have put two and two together and understood the connection to the abuse allegations, he added. 'Put another way, what was the tweet about, if it was not pointing the finger of blame at Lord McAlpine?' Dispute: Mrs Bercow has always denied that her Tweet about Lord McAlpine was defamatory . Interpretation: The Tweet at the centre of the High Court libel battle . Mrs Bercow's counsel, William McCormick QC, has told the judge that she promptly tweeted her apologies, provided letters apologising for the distress caused and making clear that the underlying allegations were untrue, and made an offer to settle the case which had not been withdrawn. He said that the tweet posed a question and contained an implied statement of fact that Lord McAlpine was trending, but this was entirely neutral and no more objectionable than the statement to precisely the same effect on the Twitter homepage. The words and punctuation of 'innocent face' were merely an indication that the question should be read with a deadpan emphasis or tone, comparable with stage directions such as sotto voce or a notation on a musical score. Dispute: Lord McAlpine is suing Mrs Bercow for defamation in the High Court over the Tweet which he says wrongly implicated him in child abuse. She denies this . Lord McAlpine's distress at the tweet was entirely comprehensible on a human level, he added. Mrs Bercow drew attention to the fact that he was trending but if readers of the Tweet were prompted by the question she posed to find tweets which defamed the peer, that was not a matter which should lead to damages against her. It was not accepted that the background events to the claim were notorious general knowledge. Lord McAlpine's career, distinguished as it was, ended 20 years ago and the Newsnight broadcast, while of real interest to some, did not attract a particularly large audience. The evidence of publicity given to the allegations fell far short of proving that on the day of the tweet - November 4 2012 - the fact of the Newsnight allegations, let alone the description of the individual concerned, was general knowledge. The extent and nature of the coverage changed markedly the day after the tweet following an interview with the Prime Minister on ITV and then again after the retraction of the original allegation by Newsnight's source. 'Whereas later coverage might fairly be described as ""blanket"" and such as to make the events ""notorious"" or general knowledge, this was not so at the time of the tweet.' He said that, even if the tweet was to be taken as referring to some form of controversy surrounding Lord McAlpine, it was a form of reportage, making no attempt to take a side in that controversy, but merely noting that it existed. The hearing is only concerned with the actual meaning of the words complained of - both a natural and ordinary meaning and an innuendo meaning. If the judge rules in Lord McAlpine's favour, there will be a hearing at a later date on the appropriate level of damages unless the two sides agree a settlement. The judge reserved his decision to a later unspecified date. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Sally Bercow wrote 'Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *Innocent face*'

The Duchess of York has been invited to Lady Thatcher’s funeral, it emerged yesterday. Sarah Ferguson, who was not invited to the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge two years ago, is believed to have confirmed she will attend Wednesday’s ceremony. Others confirmed among the guest list yesterday included celebrity chef Marco Pierre White and London Mayor Boris Johnson. Surprisingly, businessman Gerald Ronson, who was jailed for his part in the Guinness shares scandal, received an invitation, joining other discredited figures with invites, including Jonathan Aitken and Jeffrey Archer, who were both jailed for perjury. Military top brass feature heavily on the guest list, with Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards and the former head of the Army, General Sir Mike Jackson, both invited. A source said Sarah Ferguson’s invitation was not a question of her being admitted back into the Royal fold, but due to her lasting friendship with the former prime minister. The pair struck up a friendship which lasted some 25 years and the Duchess was visiting Lady Thatcher right up until the end of her life, the source added. A friend reportedly said: ‘Sarah is honoured to have been invited and intends to go. ‘She wants to pay her respects.’ The day after Lady Thatcher’s death, . the Duchess tweeted: ‘Margaret Thatcher will be greatly missed.

Other guests: Fergie will be joined by Marco Pierre White and Boris Johnson at the ceremony this Wednesday . Funeral: The service for Baroness Thatcher will be held in St Paul's Cathedral, London, starting at 11am on Wednesday . She chose the hymn He Who Would Valiant Be because its words reflected her philosophy and it was one of her childhood favourites. The Charles Wesley hymn, Love Divine, All Loves Excelling, reflects the influence of her Methodist upbringing by her father Alfred Roberts, a lay preacher. One of the most personal and significant inclusions is Psalm 84, set to the music of Johannes Brahms, which she selected for her husband Denis’s funeral. The final hymn is the patriotic I Vow To Thee My Country which she referred to in a rousing speech to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1988.","The Duchess of York has been invited to Lady Thatcher's funeral .

A survey found almost two-thirds of us hate cold callers who address customers by their first name . Answering the phone halfway through dinner to a cold caller trying to sell you things you’ll never want or need is bad enough. What’s worse? When they use your first name to do it. Almost two-thirds of us hate cold callers who address customers by their first name and start conversations with ‘hi’, a study found. It concluded that the growing trend towards informality irritated the majority of people, who would rather be addressed properly by strangers. More than half would prefer to be addressed as Mr, Mrs or Miss rather than by their first names, the survey found. Nearly a third of the 1,000 polled said it annoyed them when someone they didn’t know called them by their first name. The figure was slightly higher among the over-60s. Three in ten said they were fed up with strangers, from cold callers to coffee shop workers,  treating them like friends. That included having their first name written on their takeaway coffee cup, a policy imported to Britain from the US by Starbucks. Twelve per cent of those surveyed said they did not like the practice. Almost a third said they resented receiving personalised emails from companies that were contacting them at random. Even those who use social media - a far more informal approach to communication - do not like the faux-friendliness of the networking sites. Nearly one in five objected to Facebook's 'how's it going?' messages on status bars where users post updates. People also objected to faux-friendliness on Facebook with a fifth disliking the 'how's it going?' message . And around a fifth said they did not like their bank using their first name rather than their full title in telephone conversations. The most traditional views were held in Wales, where 38 per cent said they disliked the growing informality of modern Britain. The most relaxed region was Scotland, where only 21 per cent said they were concerned. A spokesman for Ask Jeeves, which commissioned the survey, said: ‘There is nothing wrong with friendliness but it just doesn’t wash when it comes from someone you have never met or even spoken to. ‘Often these are people who are trying to sell you something and who have no other interest in you yet they treat you like a long-lost pal. ‘Britons are saying “enough is enough” and do not think it is old-fashioned to demand a bit of respect and to be called Mr, Mrs, or Miss by cold callers, sales staff and others.’ Unsurprisingly, older Britons dislike the trend most, with 62 per cent of the over-60s demanding to be called Mr, Mrs or Miss when addressed by strangers.","Poll finds three in ten people fed up with strangers treating them like friends .

Alzheimer's sufferer Irene Hearn, with her son Rodger Hearn at her Care home in Winborne, Dorset . A bank has applied to repossess the home of an 80-year-old Alzheimer’s sufferer after giving her a mortgage she could not hope to repay. Just seven months before the credit crunch struck, Irene Rose Hearn, then 74, was allowed to take out a £470,000 interest-only five-year mortgage by the Abbey National. Experts say it would be ‘virtually impossible’ for Mrs Hearn to take out such a loan in today’s more prudent lending climate. Mrs Hearn, a widow with 13 grandchildren, had been hoping to repay the loan by selling the house because, at the time, property prices were rising and the economy was booming. But the financial crisis means she is unable to pay it back by selling up as the £675,000 house has plunged £200,000 in value. She is now facing a court battle to keep the family home. In 2006, three years before her family say her Alzheimer’s set in, Mrs Hearn, a retired property developer, agreed to pay a monthly mortgage bill of £493 even though she could afford it only with help from her son Rodger, 58. But when this deal ended, she was put on a new repayment loan arrangement by Santander, which took over Abbey, and was told she had to pay £4,219 a month. Unable to make the repayments on her £594-a-month pension, she fell into debt and was taken to court by the bank, which won a repossession order on the house, which her son arranged to have built for her. The family are challenging the court decision, but may lose the detached four-bedroom house in the exclusive area of Lilliput in Poole, Dorset, near the millionaires’ playground of Sandbanks. Her son, also a property developer, said: ‘This is appalling behaviour by a bank. Santander messed up by giving her the wrong mortgage and are now saying they want their money back. Irene was granted the mortgage by the Abbey National just three years before her Alzheimer's set in . ‘So they forced a mortgage on her that she simply could not afford so that they could repossess the house and get some of their money back. How could any bank force a ten-year repayment mortgage on an 80-year-old? It’s madness to think she could afford to pay £4,000-a-month. She’s retired.’ The heartbreaking case comes just before a damning investigation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) is expected to reveal the full scale of the interest-only mortgage scandal, which some experts fear could be the next mis-selling debacle. Around 40 per cent of homeowners who have a mortgage have an interest-only loan, which means they only pay the interest every month, but not a penny of the actual loan. In recent months, some of Britain’s biggest mortgage lenders, such as the Nationwide, Co-Op, HSBC, RBS, have all stopped selling these controversial types of mortgage. Santander now insists on a 50per cent deposit to secure an interest-only loan. Mrs Hearn's home is now worth less than what it was when they took out the loan. Around 40 per cent of homeowners who have a mortgage have an interest-only loan . Mrs Hearn, a frail pensioner who now lives in a care home, was originally offered the five-year interest-only mortgage for £470,000 by Abbey National in December 2006. Her son claims the house he built two years earlier was worth £675,000 at the time, but fell to £450,000. So when the five-year term was up, Mrs Hearn, who has four grown-up children from her marriage to Ronald Hearn who serviced power stations and died at the age of 63 in 1990, would not have been able to sell the house without making a loss as it was worth less than the £475,000 mortgage. Her son attempted to remortgage his mother’s house to allow for a recovery in property prices. But Santander instead put her on a ten-year repayment mortgage of £4,219-a-month - an increase of 750per cent on her interest-only repayments - which she would have to repay by the age of 90. Mr Hearn, who now lives in the house, said he blames the resulting stress for worsening his mother’s condition. He said: ‘My mother’s illness has deteriorated since this began and I think the stress of losing her family home has not helped. ‘I have lost sleep and my marriage broke up as a result of this. If we lose this house, I’ll be selling the Big Issue. I feel victimised and I don’t know when I’m going to be homeless. ‘They mis-sold a mortgage to my mother and forced a loan on her which she has no hope of paying back. This isn’t unusual. They’re doing it up and down the country.’ David Hollingworth from the mortgage advisors London & Country said it would be ‘virtually impossible’ for a woman in her 70s to take out this type of loan nowadays. Typically, any mortgage must have been repaid by the time the homeowner reaches the age of 70 or 75, he said. A spokesman for Santander said that following an FSA review of the mortgage industry, lenders can no longer offer mortgages to those of retirement age. He added that ‘sale of the property’ is no longer considered an appropriate way to repay an interest-only mortgage. A spokesman for Santander said: ‘Repossession is always the last resort for Santander. We always consider every option to keep a customer in their home, including looking at alternative payments plans and terms. ‘In line with this policy, we have fully explored the options open to Mrs Hearn, and whilst we are of sorry that she is losing her home, Mrs Hearn has been unable to make the payments due on her loan.’","Irene Rose Hearn, then 74, was granted a £470,000 interest-only mortgage .

A socialite and friend of the stars has been found murdered in his £2million Mayfair home. Robert Troyan, 63, was discovered with a gash to his head in a pool of blood by his horrified maid in the kitchen of the luxury flat. He knew Sting and the musician’s wife Trudie Styler through his late partner, architect and interior designer Anthony Feldman, whose clients included Princess Michael of Kent and former Tory Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken. Murder probe launched: The body of Robert Troyan, 63, was discovered at his luxury flat in this apartment block in Mount Street, Mayfair . Before Mr Feldman’s death, the couple . were famed for their lavish Mayfair dinner parties where guests said the . champagne was ‘always chilled and ready to open’. Mr Troyan is believed to have spoken . to his maid by phone only two hours before his body was found last . Friday afternoon. After making the grim discovery when she arrived at . the mansion block at 4pm, she collapsed on her knees in hysterical . screams. The building's caretaker said retired American Mr Troyan's regular cleaner was 'uncontrollable' after finding his body on Friday afternoon . A source at the block said: ‘It was a head wound, there was blood pouring on the floor. ‘Workmen working above – they are . doing a new kitchen – heard her screaming and shouting. The workmen said . they didn’t touch his body, but could tell that he wasn’t breathing.’ ‘His cleaner was inconsolable. The . police had to take her to the police station, and she was on her hands . and knees crying her eyes out.’ The source said Mr Troyan was always . friendly but ‘would often be visited by strange men, at all times of the . day and night’, at the flat, which he rented. Black bags removed from the flat every . morning could be heard ‘rattling with bottles’. He added: ‘One guy who . visited was staggering a lot. This was in the afternoon. I think it was . just drink, not drugs. He never came back again.’ Mr Troyan sometimes played loud music . and had noisy conversations, and the people in the flat below had . complained on at least one occasion. He was born in Italy to a wealthy . family but lived in the US for most of his youth. Mr Troyan studied art . at college in Boston before moving to Britain, where he met Mr Feldman . in 1983. An obituary in the Times after Mr . Feldman’s death said: ‘They were both immensely kind and generous to . people in need and to charities for the homeless. Trudie Styler enlisted . them for her and Sting’s campaign for Tibet.’ Mr Feldman came to London from . Johannesburg as an 18-year-old to study and went on to become an . internationally successful interior designer and architect who took on . commissions in London, Paris, New York, Hungary and Turkey. Affluent: Flats on the street sell for £2-3million, while a nine-bedroom property on Mount Street is currently on the market for £32million . Top of his profession: Mr Feldman's clients included Princess Michael of Kent (above) in Kensington Palace . Mr Troyan and Mr Feldman worked on . many design projects together, but their most cherished one was the top . two storeys of the 1782 Henry Holland house in Mayfair they shared, . where they painted the floors and fireplace in eight shades of pale grey . and several shades of white. Their large drawing-room was adorned . with a Bechstein grand piano and a dining table laid with mixed old . china, napkins specially sewn in Turkey and Bohemian glasses for their . extravagant dinners. They became the first to take part in a . civil partnership in Westminster in 2005 after being given dispensation . to pre-empt the official start date because Mr Feldman had terminal . cancer. He died aged 52 eight days after the ceremony. About six years after Mr Feldman’s . death, Mr Troyan moved out of that flat and into the flat, also in . Mayfair, where he was found murdered. A neighbour in his former flat said: . ‘He [Mr Troyan] came from a very moneyed background in America. 'He was . totally devastated by Anthony’s death. It was Anthony that really kept . everything running smoothly in both their lives. ‘After Anthony died, there was quite a . lot of coming and going of various characters, and it caused some . problems. Nothing would surprise me.’ Detective Chief Inspector Tim . Duffield, from Scotland Yard’s homicide and serious crime Command, said: . ‘We are appealing for anyone who knew Robert to come forward. ‘He was a very well known character in Mayfair; whom friends describe as kind and extremely generous. ‘We are confident that his murder took place on the March 8 some time before 4pm.’","Robert Troyan, 63, found by cleaner 'in pool of blood in his kitchen'

The daughter of Ariel Castro has made a tearful plea for her best friend's forgiveness after her father kidnapped the girl and held her captive for almost a decade. Arlene Castro choked back tears as she appeared in an interview on Thursday morning to say she hoped she could see Gina DeJesus soon and introduce her to her children. Ms Castro had been the last person to see DeJesus, then 14, before she was allegedly snatched by her father, Ariel Castro, in 2004 and imprisoned in his Cleveland home. Speaking to Good Morning America, Ms Castro said she never had any suspicions her friend was tied up inside the house, along with two other missing women, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight. Scroll down for videos . Emotional: Ariel Castro's daughter Arlene burst into tears as she apologized to her best friend Gina DeJesus, who was kidnapped by her father and held captive for nearly 10 years . Overwhelmed: She said she had no idea that her father was keeping three women locked up in his home . 'I'm absolutely so, so sorry,' she . told GMA as tears rolled down her cheeks. 'I really want to see you Gina . and I want you to meet my kids. I'm so sorry for everything.' Gina, . who said she was not close with her father, added: 'I'm really . disappointed, embarrassed, devastated about this whole situation.' A . year after DeJesus' disappearance, Arlene had appeared on America's . Most Wanted to recount their last day together and to plead for new . information, unaware that the girl was so close. The teenagers had been best friends at Wilbur Wright Middle School in Cleveland and, along with another girl, Kayla Rogers, were like 'The Three Musketeers', friends have said. Best of friends: Arlene Castro (right) was the last person to see Gina DeJesus (left) in 2004. Arlene's father Ariel has been charged in her abduction . Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. 'They were the best of the best of the best of friends,' Lupe Collins, whose daughter was also friends with the girls, told NBC. 'Kayla and [Arlene] and Georgina, they were tight, they were like three musketeers. They wouldn't leave each other's sight.' Kayla and Gina met in elementary school, and they both met Arlene in middle school. They would often go to each others' homes to listen to Spanish music and rap and practice their dance moves. 'We used to hang out on Gina's porch,' Kayla Rogers told NBC. 'We had a couple sleepovers.' They would chat on the phone and talk about boys, Rogers said. 'We were gossips. Gossip girls.' Rogers said she saw Arlene's father as he worked as a school bus driver. 'He was my bus driver, also,' Rogers said. 'He'd wink at me and… ugh.' Coming home: Gina Dejesus, now 23, who disappeared in Cleveland, Ohio in 2004, escaped from a home on Monday just miles from where she went missing - and is believed to have known her abductor .

'I . pinch myself every morning and it's awesome. I'm unable to describe the . feeling I have. It's so awesome to have her home.' When she saw her daughter, who is now 23, for the first time since her kidnapping, Nancy Ruiz said they did not even speak. 'We just grabbed each other and held on,' she said. 'There was just hugging and kissing and crying.' Relief: Gina's mother Nancy Ruiz said on Thursday that it was 'awesome' to have her daughter home .

'Captor': Ariel Castro, 52, has been charged with kidnapping and raping the three women . 'I knew she was strong,' she said of her daughter. 'I didn't know how strong she was.' Arlene . Castro had planned to go to Gina's house on the day she disappeared in . April, 2004. But when Arlene called her mother to ask permission, she . was told to come straight home and the girls parted ways. A year after her friend disappeared, Arlene Castro told America's Most Wanted: . 'She [Gina] gave me 50 cents to call my mom - and my mom said no I . can't go over to her house. So I told her and she [Gina] said ''ok'' and . just walked.' After Gina gave Arlene 50 cents to call . her mom, she didn't have enough money for bus fare and so began to walk . home - but never made it. Gina was not seen again until she . escaped from a home owned by Arlene's father Ariel - around three miles . from where she went missing. Further . details have emerged about the close links that Ariel Castro kept . to the families of the missing women, even attending vigils on the . anniversaries of their disappearances alongside distraught family and . friends.

'I’m devastated,' Joy Anderson said to the Washington Post. 'I’m just torn to pieces by the stupidity. It could have been avoided. The way she died, no one deserves to die like that.' Victoria Kong, 83, had made the return trip to Barbados at least 10 times before but when she got off American Airlines Flight 1094 last Friday at Reagan National Airport she was in a state of confusion. Disappearance: Surveillance footage shows Victoria Kong, 83, as she walks through the terminal after arriving at Reagan National Airport around 4pm on May 3 .

Mrs Kong, who suffers from dementia, . walked past an American Airlines representative her family had sent to . meet her at the gate as she off the plane, and then walked past her own . daughter and granddaughter who were waiting downstairs. Surveillance video shows Mrs Kong walked through baggage claim while daughter Joy, was facing in a different direction. By 4:12 p.m., the family said, video showed Kong leaving through a door, never to return. Searchers, volunteers and Mrs Kong's family spent the weekend combing the area around the airport. Missed connections: It seems a series of chance errors led to grandmother Victoria Kong (pictured) walking out of the airport and ultimately to her death . Her body was found on Monday huddled in a heavily wooded area, in a park just up the road from the airport terminal. Her daughter said Mrs Kong had . been showing some early signs of dementia and that they were worried . about her safety. She had been experiencing memory loss and confusion . since her husband died last year but had never wandered off before. Kong’s family had arranged for wheelchair service with American Airlines and an agent helped Kong get to her flight. Relatives have said that they . requested for the airline to escort Mrs Kong both to and from her seat, . but American said the family only requested service to the gate. Upon arriving in Washington, Mrs Kong . never made contact with the escort from the airline who duty it was to . wheel her down to baggage claim. The family can only assume that she either didn't see the sign or was confused about who was picking her up. One level below in the arrivals area, . her daughter Joy, had no idea what was going on. She was excited . to see her mother and had bought her a new cardigan to keep her warm. The family had recently renovated the . house and added handrails in the shower so she could get around easier. Reservations had been made for Mother's Day lunch. Looking over the surveillance video, . authorities said that she was not visibly in distress or disoriented. She is seen talking with people and sitting calmly on a bench. In the meantime, her daughter . was still patiently waiting. Luggage from the flight began to arrive . along with other wheelchair passengers. After a little while longer she began to grow concerned. She had mother paged and even asked at the ticket desk. Nobody seemed to know anything. One . employee told her that Mrs Kong was still by the gate whilst another . said that she was in the bathroom. Ms Anderson called American's 800 number. 'Please help me find my mom,' she begged. 'I’m screaming mad right now.' An hour and a half later, she approached the airport police. Confusion: Mrs Kong's family had been waiting to collect her in the baggage claim area of the DC airport but she never appeared . Concerns: Mrs Kong's family said that she was suffering from early signs of dementia . Alone: Mrs Kong was supposed to be escorted off the American Airlines flight by wheelchair but appears to have wandered off . It marked the start of a three day . search for Victoria Kong that involved a boat, dogs, a helicopter, . volunteers and CCTV video of several different parts of the airport. At the weekend, tracking dogs, who . had sniffed Kong’s luggage manage to follow her scent to a wooded area . about 200 yards from the airport perimeter. The area where she was found is just off the walking path where it drops off at a steep angle into an area of growth and leaves. She was still long flower-print dress she wore on the flight. She had her purse, and there were no signs of foul play. U.S. Park Police are waiting for an . official cause of death, but relatives said that it appears Kong died . from the chilly weather. Her family are devastated but are now planning her funeral. Her granddaughter Alexandria Anderson still has the cardigan she was going to give to her grandma.

Gina Lollobrigida’s ex-lover Javier Rigau told for the first time last night of his ‘devastation’ after the . Italian film star accused him of faking their wedding. He insisted that they had married in secret in 2010 and said he has never had any interest in Ms Lollobrigida’s £35 million fortune – substantiating his claim by revealing he signed two financial agreements before the wedding. The former screen goddess, 85, last week claimed he was a ‘vulture’ who duped her into marrying to get his hands on her money. But Mr Rigau, a Spanish businessman himself said to be worth £36 million, said: ‘It’s monstrous. She knows we are married and I have never been interested in her money. I am an independently wealthy businessman and I have earned every penny I own. We signed two financial agreements before the wedding. ‘One was a separation of assets, so although we are married we have our own independent assets. The second was a pre-nuptial agreement so I stand to earn absolutely nothing from the  marriage.’ Ms Lollobrigida has claimed to Italian police that she had discovered  Mr Rigau had used fake documents to carry out a marriage by proxy without her knowledge just over two years ago. In such a ceremony, an absent bride or groom’s vows can be spoken by someone else on their behalf. But Mr Rigau insisted they married out of love and enjoyed a healthy physical relationship despite a 34-year age gap. In an exclusive interview at his sprawling mansion in one of Barcelona’s plushest neighbourhoods, Mr Rigau, 51, claimed they were happily married, albeit secretly, until just two weeks ago. Mr Rigau said: ‘We have been together for almost 30 years and Gina wanted to get married. We were madly in love. ‘It’s devastating for me to hear her speaking about me the way she is. I am a very private person and I am only speaking about this because Gina has said some very hurtful things publicly in the press. ‘I believe she has been turned against me and against everyone else who loves her – her family and friends – by a new adviser. It breaks my heart to hear her speaking about me the way she is.’ MR Rigau’s claims add a new twist to a story so bizarre it is worthy of any Hollywood blockbuster. Ms Lollobrigida, once described as ‘the most beautiful woman in the world’, was one of cinema’s biggest names in the Sixties. The actress first met Mr Rigau, a debonair entrepreneur from Barcelona, at a party in Monte Carlo in 1984.Despite their age difference, they fell in love and had a passionate romance. The couple lived a glamorous, jet-set lifestyle, moving between homes in Rome, Sicily, Monte Carlo and Barcelona. They made plans to marry in New York in November 2006, and later changed the plan to wed in Rome in January 2007. But the wedding was called off because Mr Rigau could not cope with the media spotlight. To the outside world, the relationship was over. Leading man: Javier Rigau with Gina, left, and Maria Gabilondo, the woman who says she stood in for Gina at her wedding, right . But Mr Rigau, who drives a Rolls-Royce . Silver Cloud, now claims they could not bear to be apart and got back . together four months later, keeping their relationship secret to avoid . publicity. He said they decided to marry by proxy to avoid the media attention their previous wedding plans had attracted. That account is in stark contrast to the actress’s version of events. She . has accused him of being a fraudster who conned her into signing proxy . wedding papers in order to inherit her fortune on her death. Ms . Lollobrigida, who lives in Rome, revealed her claims about the ‘fake . wedding’ in an interview with an Italian newspaper last week. She . said: ‘This vile person married me by proxy, without my knowledge and . without my permission, in order to inherit my estate after my death.’ In . another interview with the Daily Mail, she said she wanted Rigau jailed . over the ‘fraud’. The . former sex symbol said she discovered the marriage after stumbling . across documents on the internet published by a disgruntled ex-business . partner of Mr Rigau. However, . Mr Rigau said Ms Lollobrigida flew to Barcelona in August 2010 with her . lawyer Giulia Citana to sign an agreement to marry by proxy. The papers . were signed in front of a notary at the five-star Princesa Sofia Hotel . near FC Barcelona’s Camp Nou football ground, he said. He added the proxy marriage took place on November 29, 2010, at the Sant Vicenc church in Sarria, where Mr Rigau lives. A . mutual friend, Maria Pilar Guimera Gabilondo, 72, from Barcelona, stood . in for the actress at the ceremony, which was attended by eight guests. Last night she revealed Ms Lollobrigida asked her to be her stand-in at . the wedding. Wedding venue: Mr Rigau says the couple got married by proxy at Sant Vincenc church in Sarria, Barcelona, in 2010 . ‘She asked me . to represent her at the church because she wanted to keep it secret . from the press,’ Mrs Gabilondo told a newspaper. Mrs Gabilondo said that she and Mr Rigau, who is a family friend in Barcelona, went with Miss Lollobrigida to see a notary to sign the legal papers. ‘Of course I thought it was strange that she didn’t want to attend her own wedding, but if a woman like that asks, you don’t say no,’ she added. ‘I’ve met her many times when she visited Javier in Spain and I’m astounded she now claims to know nothing about me or the wedding.’ Mr Rigau, whose full name is Francisco Javier Rigau y Rafols, said: ‘The idea Gina did not know she was getting married is preposterous. ‘She was as keen as I was to marry. That’s why she flew to Barcelona to sign the papers. ‘Unfortunately, over the past two years Gina has been getting some very bad advice. She has fallen out with her son Mirko, her 18-year-old grandson Dimitri, her lawyer and many friends. I was the last person left from her inner circle and now she has been turned against me. ‘I last saw her in Rome two weeks ago and everything was fine. She never mentioned any problems.’ Mr Rigau, who owns a property company in Spain,  says she is denying knowledge of the wedding because of the influence of her new manager , 25-year-old Andrea Piazzolla. Sizzling: Gina Llobrigida was one of the sex symbols of her day when she starred in films alongside Frank Sinatra and Humphrey Bogart during the 1950s and 60s . The mystery deepened on Friday when Ms Lollobrigida’s former lawyer, Giulia Citani, told The Mail on Sunday that the marriage did take place. Speaking from her office in Fiumicino, near Rome, she said: ‘You have to remember Gina is 85 so she sometimes has trouble remembering things but I can tell you she is legally married. There is legal documentation in Spain which proves that she agreed to be married and that the ceremony took place. ‘I don’t really want to go into too much detail as I can’t betray my lawyers’ oath – also I no longer represent Gina as we had a disagreement. ‘I accompanied Gina to Barcelona and documents were signed at the Italian consulate which authorised the marriage and this document was used for the marriage. ‘Gina is confused and perhaps doesn’t remember what happened.’ In Rome The Mail on Sunday approached Ms Lollobrigida’s 64-year-old son Mirko, from her first marriage to Slovenian Mirko Skofic, but he refused to comment.","Javier Rigau says couple married at church in Barcelona in 2010 .

BP has asked the Government to help it battle a wave of ‘fictitious’ claims for billions in compensation over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The oil giant says lawyers are encouraging Gulf Coast businesses to make spurious claims just to earn a commission. BP has set aside £28billion to cover the cost of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion on April 20, 2010, which killed 11 workers and spilled an estimated 4million barrels of oil into the sea. Disaster: The explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig, pictured, which killed 11 workers and spilled an estimated 4million barrels of oil into the sea, has led to billions in payouts from BP . It initially earmarked £5.2billion to compensate local businesses who were hit in the pocket, but it now expects the total to be much higher. There are fears the final compensation bill could even put the company’s future at risk. A surge in claims has been aided by US lawyers seeking out claimants to make a commission, oil industry sources believe. BP also argues that the administrator of the claims, Louisiana lawyer Patrick Juneau, has been far too generous to businesses. Earlier this year, BP asked the judge to impose a temporary freeze on compensation demands. SOS: Reports have claimed that BP is seeking the help of David Cameron to avoid a slew of compensation claims which, it is feared, could put the future of the entire company at risk . It offered examples of firms that have lodged claims despite  being based miles away from affected areas. In . one, a North Alabama construction company received £6.38million after . putting in claims for lost income – despite not doing any work in the . region. The company also disagrees with the methodology used to calculate how much businesses have lost. The oil giant told the judge that it could be ‘irreparably harmed’ by such ‘fictitious’ and ‘absurd’ claims. Appeal: But David Cameron did not raise the issue of BP's troubles during his recent meeting with Barack Obama. An industry insider said it was unlikely the government could achieve much lobbying the White House . BP . declined to comment yesterday, while a spokesman for Number 10 said . only that the Prime Minister had held no conversations with the company. But Whitehall officials are believed to have held informal talks with BP executives. One industry insider said it was unlikely that the government could achieve much by lobbying the White House on BP’s behalf. ‘There’s not a lot that even Obama can do to intervene in the U.S. legal process,’ he said. The huge cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has already left BP a shadow of its former self. It has sold off £25billion of assets to help pay for the clean-up of the Gulf and to cover compensation claims. The . firm also lost its chief executive, as Slough-born Tony Hayward was . forced out after making a series of high-profile gaffes that enraged . Americans. He told reporters . ‘I would like my life back’, prompting fury from those affected by the . spill, and was later spotted enjoying himself at a yacht race around the . Isle of Wight. BP’s efforts . to win government backing come at an unfortunate time, after it was . named alongside Shell in a European Commission probe into oil price . fixing.

The jury found Jodi Arias eligible for the death penalty today following her murder conviction for killing her lover. Jurors reached their decision on Wednesday just hours after the prosecutor went through stab wound by stab wound that she inflicted on Travis Alexander during the prolonged killing. Last week she was found guilty of the premeditated, first-degree murder of Alexander after stabbing him more than 27 times, slicing his throat and shooting him in the bathroom of his Mesa, Arizona home in June 2008. Scroll down for video . Stoic: Jodi Arias looked at each juror as they individually said in court that they believed she was eligible for the death penalty on the grounds of Alexander's death being especially cruel . Facing the consequences: Jodi Arias appeared in court again on Wednesday as the jury has to decide whether she should spend more than 25 years behind bars or be sentenced to death . Awful: Travis Alexander's sisters Samantha (left) and Tanisha (right) got very emotional as the graphic crime was relived through words and photos . The decision came after a day of testimony in the 'aggravation' phase of the trial, during which prosecutor Juan Martinez hoped to prove the 2008 killing was committed in an especially cruel and heinous manner. Alexander's two sisters sobbed as the medical examiner explained how each of the stab wounds caused tangible pain. The trial moves into the final phase on Thursday, in which prosecutors will call Alexander's family and other witnesses in an effort to convince the panel Arias should face the ultimate punishment. Arias' attorneys also will call witnesses, likely members of her family, in an attempt to gain sympathy from jurors so they give her life in prison. Today's aggravation proceedings were intended to start on Thursday but Arias was put in a psychiatric hold and under suicide watch after telling a local news station that she would rather receive the death penalty as opposed to life in prison because she expects that she will live a long time. Final shot: Prosecutor Juan Martinez went through each of the more than 27 stab wounds that Alexander suffered . Tough job: Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi spoke briefly about the need for the jury to focus solely on whether the murder was an 'especially heinous' one . The jury had to decide whether the . convicted murderer will spend the rest of her days behind bars, or if . she could be sentenced to death. That . is determined by the nature of the crime, meaning that they have to . decide if it was an especially cruel, heinous and depraved killing and . if so, then they may sentence her to death. Prosecutor Juan Martinez took the floor first on Wednesday, describing how the angles at which she stabbed Alexander as he lay on the floor of his bathroom shows that she was standing above him. 'We know that he was alive in the sense he could see, breath and hear what was coming,' Martinez said. 'Mr Alexander suffered pain every time that blade entered his body. 'She made sure of it, by stabbing him over and over again...then finishing him off across the throat.' Gut-wrenching: Tanisha Sorenson turns away from the screen as autopsy photos were shown of her slain brother . Waiting for justice: His friends and relatives have said previously that they hope she is sentenced to death . He talked about how at one point during the attack, Alexander tried to defend himself and she came at him from behind. While that would have come as a surprise in certain circumstances, Alexander was trying to stand up by the sink and would have seen her coming in the mirror. The courtroom was shown pictures of Alexander's bloody body, zoomed in on the wounds on his back and the back of his head. Relatives of Mr Alexander were seen openly weeping, covering their faces and looking down when the graphic photos were shown. Even Arias started crying, covering her face and swiveling her chair to turn away from the screen. Her fate: Since she was found guilty last Wednesday, Arias said that she would rather be sentenced to death instead of receiving life in prison, and as a result she was on suicide watch for the past week . Graphic: Medical examiner Kevon Horn told how parts of Alexander's skull were chipped off by the knife as Arias stabbed him in the back of the head during the attack . Physical battle: Arias' other ex said that she was in good physical shape, explaining that she would have been able to fight Alexander even though he was bigger than she was . Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi spoke briefly about the need for the jury to focus solely on whether the murder was an 'especially heinous' one. Martinez called his first witness, Medical examiner Kevin Horn, who went through the various wounds. He said that an examination of Alexander's head showed 'triangular pieces of the skull that have been gouged out by the knife.' He went on to say that it was his belief that Alexander was still alive when he was being stabbed in the back of the head, stabbed in his back, and when his throat was slit. One of the most jarring portions of Wednesday's testimony came when nothing was said at all: in an effort to prove that the attack- that is thought to have taken just over two minutes- was not as short as it sounds, Martinez told the court to sit silently for that time and think about how it would feel if you were being attacked continuously. Alexander's siblings were seen crying, their shoulders shaking, throughout. Reliving it: Pictures of the stab wounds on Travis' back were shown to the court which was too much for his relatives to take. Arias even turned away at different points . Arias' state-appointed defense attorney Nurmi said that jurors need to remove the emotion from their decision, specifically mentioning the two-minutes of silence. 'Your duty as jurors is to detach yourself from that emotion, from that passion,' he said in his closing arguments. Since the jury already knows that Arias murdered Alexander, the biggest legal hurdle for Martinez is to convince them that either the victim suffered pain, and that the attacker knew that she was inflicting pain. As part of that, Martinez repeatedly referred to the story that Arias said during her lengthy testimony during the original trial when she said that after being arrested she planned on killing herself but decided against it when she pricked her finger with a razor and stopped because 'it stung'. 'Travis Alexander didn't have that choice,' Martinez said. 'Every time that blade cut into him it hurt him. This was not a sting.'",Decision was reached during 'aggravation' phase of Arizona trial - where jurors agreed Travis Alexander's murder was 'especially cruel and heinous'

Patients whose treatment goes wrong should get an honest explanation and possibly an apology from their doctor, the General Medical Council has said. Doctors must put patients’ safety, dignity and comfort first, according to a new guide. For the first time, it tells patients directly what they can expect from their doctors. It comes after the scandal at Stafford Hospital, where an inquiry found doctors did not raise the alarm when patients were forced to drink water from flower vases and were left lying in their own excrement and urine for days. The new guidance makes clear that patients should expect doctors to report when things go wrong, including accidents and mistakes. They should take 'prompt action if they think that a patient's safety, dignity or comfort is being compromised.' Niall Dickson, chief executive of the GMC, said 'It is absolutely clear that doctor must tell patients when something has gone wrong. 'They must be open and honest with patients, and apologise where appropriate.' He said the new guidance was the first to be aimed at patients in the 150-year history of the GMC. But it was important in the wake of the Francis inquiry to make clear that patients' safety should come first. 'The Mid Staffs inquiry found some doctors did not raise concerns about serious failings in the standard of care' he said. Doctors who commit serious breaches of GMC rules or persistently flout them would face disciplinary proceedings' he added. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt imposed a 'statutory duty of candour' on NHS organisations in response to the inquiry, meaning patients or their families must be informed if errors in their treatment have caused death or serious injury. But so far no decision has been made . about whether to make individual doctors and nurses criminally . accountable for hiding errors. GMC . chairman Professor Sir Peter Rubin said figures released last week . showing doctors 'talking over' one in four patients as if they were not . there were unacceptable. No apologies: Heather Wilhelms' husband Tom was forced to drink out of a vase during his treatment in Stafford Hospital, where he later died . Statutory duty of candour: patients or their families must be informed if errors in their treatment have caused death or serious injury, says Jeremy Hunt . He said 'Doctors should take a lead in ensuring good practice is embedded in day to day practice. Having a quarter of patients feel they are being ignored is simply not acceptable.' Katherine Murphy, chief executive of Patients Association, said 'We firmly believe that the patient needs to be at the centre of a doctor's practice, and this guide is a useful tool to assist clinicians in achieving that goal. 'It also provides useful information to patients about what behaviour, support and assistance they should reasonably expect from their doctor.' Dr Dan Poulter MP, Health Minister, said 'The vast majority of doctors have an excellent relationship with their patients. However, the Francis report highlighted that there is much more we need to do to put patients at the heart of healthcare.' The guide for patients is based on the standards for doctors set out and apply to all 250,000 doctors on the medical register, including those from abroad working in the NHS.

A young cystic fibrosis sufferer is dying slowly in hospital after NHS chiefs refused to give her a new wonder drug - despite manufacturers offering to give it to hospitals for free. Caroline Cassin, 29,from Birmingham, West Midlands, was rushed to hospital last week after her condition suddenly worsened. She could benefit from new drug Kalydeco, which normally costs £182,000 a year - money that the cash-strapped NHS are unable to afford due to swingeing cuts. Caroline Cassin, 29, is dying slowly from Cystic Fibrosis in Heartlands Hospital - NHS bosses have refused to give her a wonder drug that could save her life . Pretty blonde Caroline's condition worsened last Monday and she was admitted to the hospital for the sixth time since January . But despite makers of the drug offering to make it available free for a limited period, bosses at Heartlands Hospital say it would be unethical to treat patients only for the drug to be stopped at a later date. Campaigners are to take Caroline's case to the European Court of Human Rights claiming that the hospital's refusal to provide the treatment files in the face of doctors' Hippocratic Oath - which pledges that they must do all in their power to save lives. The pharmaceutical company behind the drug, which will be re-branded Ivacaftor if made available in the UK, have offered to make the drug available to sufferers of the condition with a lung capacity under 40 per cent. Last Friday, Caroline registered a shockingly low 26 per cent. Five years ago, the pretty blonde could hold down a four-day-a-week job at Selfridges but was forced to cut her hours to three days and then one. From the age of 16 she has visited Heartlands twice a year for treatment. but when her health deteriorated alarmingly last Monday she was admitted to the hospital for the sixth time since January. Caroline Cassin's devastated parents Neil, 72, and Carole, 65, say that the NHS Trust's refusal to treat their daughter with Kalydeco is 'cruel beyond belief' She bravely told friends a month ago: 'I am clinging on.' Her frustrated father Neil, 72, said: 'She is very low now. She knows that she is dying. Caroline has struggled for 29 years and it has been horrendous at times, but the last year has been the worst. 'She has always been a good girl, but she is very low now. The NHS Trust is sitting by while we are watching Caroline’s health deteriorate at an alarming rate. How much longer can this go on? 'To have this one chance of life taken away after a lifetime of suffering is cruel beyond belief. 'The drug would get rid of the bugs that impact on her breathing. It suppresses the problems. 'Her quality of life would be improved massively improved. She’s on the brink of death and she won’t get better until she has the drug. 'It’s the only chance of her having a life. She’s been on non-stop antibiotics. The drug could extend her life seven to ten years. 'The bugs that are being treated by the antibiotics would be flushed out. 'It would keep her out of hospital, help her breathing and she could walk around freely. They call it a ‘miracle drug’ in America. There’s a girl there who was on the lung transplant list but has been taken off it since she went on this drug. 'The doctors want to give it to her - but the hospital management stepped in and stopped it. 'They had told her she would get it and we were thrilled and delighted for her. 'It was a lifeline for her that was cruelly snatched away from her and she feels absolutely devastated and let down. Caroline Cassin, pictured here on a night out with friends. The cystic fibrosis sufferer recorded a lung capacity of just 29 per cent last Friday . Pictured in healthier days, Caroline Cassin managed to keep up a four-day working week at Selfridges until her health recently declined . 'I’m very angry and frustrated with the hospital bosses. She’s been back in hospital for a week now after just coming out. She’s lying in bed on oxygen helpless. It gets worse and worse.' Mum Carole, 65, aded: 'She has always been tiny, but very strong-willed. Now her face looks so different. She is very depressed. The situation is grave.' A Heartlands Hospital spokesman said: 'We fully support our patients and are doing everything in our power to facilitate a fair solution. Caroline Cassin's furious parents say that the drug would improve their daughter's quality of life 'massively' Birmingham Heartlands Hospital where Caroline Cassin is currently undergoing treatment for her worsening cystic fibrosis . 'The Trust decided not to obtain Kalydeco on a compassionate basis because the drug company named patient scheme for free Kalydeco is temporary and the Trust would face withdrawing the medication when the scheme stops, which would be unethical. 'We have approached our commissioners to apply for funding and are putting together an exception application to the Primary Care Trust. 'As soon as we receive an update on our application for funding and the special exception application to the Primary Care Trust, we will share this with our patients and their families.' A spokesman for NHS Birmingham and Solihull said: 'We are unable to discuss individual cases. However, we can confirm that to date we have not received a formal request for this drug.

Contempt proceedings are to be brought against a number of people who posted photos on the internet claiming to show James Bulger killers Jon Venables or Robert Thompson, the Attorney General said today. Venables was ten when he and classmate Thompson abducted and murdered two-year-old James in Liverpool in February 1993. Images recently appeared on Twitter claiming to show an adult Venables, who was released from jail on licence with a new identity in 2001. Killers: Contempt proceedings are to be brought against people who have posted photos claiming to show Jon Venables (left) or Robert Thompson (right), the Attorney General has said . The Attorney General said court papers will be served shortly to bring contempt proceedings against those who posted the pictures, which have since been taken down. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, of the High Court Family Division, made an unprecedented court order banning publication of any information which could lead to the revelation of their new identities. A statement from the Attorney General's Office said: 'The terms of the order mean that if a picture claims to be of Venables or Thompson, even if it is not actually them, there will be a breach of the order. 'Providing details of the new identities of Venables and Thompson or their whereabouts is also prohibited - this order applies to material which is on the internet. 'There are many different images circulating online claiming to be of Venables or Thompson - potentially innocent individuals may be wrongly identified as being one of the two men and placed in danger. 'The order, and its enforcement, is therefore intended to protect not only Venables and Thompson but also those members of the public who have been incorrectly identified as being one of the two men.' Victim: James Bulger was killed after he was abducted from the Bootle Strand shopping centre. The Attorney General Dominic Grieve said potentially innocent people may be wrongly identified in the pictures posted online . Breaches of the order may be a contempt of court punishable by a jail sentence or fine, the statement said. Venables, now 30, had his parole revoked in 2010 and was jailed for two years after admitting downloading and distributing indecent images of children. James's mother Denise Fergus, has always opposed the injunction, fearing it could lead to innocent men being accused of being James's killers. Venables and Thompson abducted James from the Bootle Strand shopping centre in Merseyside before torturing and killing him. Abduction: CCTV footage showed James being led by the hand away from the Strand shopping centre . The two boys, who were truanting from school, walked James around the streets of Liverpool for more than two miles, stopping occasionally to kick and punch him. They told adults who intervened that he was their brother. After taking him to a nearby railway line, they left his body on the tracks in the hope it would be destroyed by a train. The toddler had been splattered with blue paint and his battered head lay surrounded by a pile of bricks. His body was found two days later by children playing on a freight railway line. Appeal: James's parent Ralph and Denise at a tearful press conference in the wake of his disappearance . Other high-profile cases of offences involving social media include nine people who were each ordered to pay compensation to a woman raped by footballer Ched Evans who they named on Twitter or Facebook. And the most high-profile leak on Twitter was the naming of footballer Ryan Giggs as he tried to protect his identity. Giggs, 38, took out an injunction in April 2011 to prevent the media from reporting allegations that he had an extra-marital affair with former Big Brother contestant Imogen Thomas and allegations that she had blackmailed him. The Manchester United star was the subject of so much speculation on Twitter that eventually Lib Dem MP John Hemming 'outed' him in the House of Commons. Contempt of court is essentially interfering with the administration of justice. This offence can be committed in a number of ways, but will result in justice not being properly carried out. Someone who is found to be guilty of contempt is said to have disobeyed or been disrespectful to the court's authority. An example of contempt includes revealing somebody's identity that had been protected by the courts, such as a high profile celebrity who may have obtained an injunction to prevent stories being published about them. Other examples include a member of a jury telling others of what was said during deliberations, or an organisation publishing information which could prejudice the jury in a trial. Anybody found guilty of contempt of court may be sent to prison. Source: findlaw.co.uk .","Images recently appeared on Twitter claiming to show Venables .

Screening older people for early dementia when they visit their GP could do more harm than good, a leading expert has warned. Dr Chris Fox said the plans were ‘a disaster in slow motion’ because people without symptoms could be wrongly diagnosed and have their lives thrown into turmoil. He believes patients with minor memory problems could drain the NHS of vital resources needed for those who have conditions such as Alzheimer’s. Around one in three older people will develop some form of cognitive impairment or memory problem – which can be picked up in tests but may never lead to full-blown dementia. Warning: Screening older people for early dementia when they visit their GP could do more harm than good, a leading expert has warned (file picture) Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt thinks doctors are refusing to carry out tests because there is no effective cure available. He is pushing for GPs to screen people for signs of dementia even if they do not have obvious symptoms. But Dr Fox, an old-age psychiatry specialist at the University of East Anglia, has raised concerns about the impact the tests will have on patients. He said: ‘Routine screening means that people will be diagnosed long before they start to show symptoms. A diagnosis can turn someone’s life upside down years before dementia itself does. ‘On a personal level, just knowing that you have this illness coming will lead to all sorts of problems – from profound anxiety and stress for the patient and their families, to a loss of independence, an impact on their career if they are still working and social isolation. 'And all of this before symptoms are obvious.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt thinks doctors are refusing to carry out tests because there is no effective cure available . Dr Fox predicted that vast sums of money would have to be diverted to people who will have a raised expectation of treatment and support at a time when the NHS is struggling to cope with those already diagnosed with dementia. He added: ‘Current tests are not particularly robust and there is a relatively high risk of misdiagnosis so all of this turmoil could be even more unnecessary. ‘It is unfair to cause fear and concern when treatments are not available, the chances of the condition actually progressing are not clear, and when symptoms may never take hold in the patient’s lifetime. ‘Dementia is an undeniable concern for ageing societies, but the key is a more timely and swift diagnosis when symptoms become apparent – not routine screening.’ The UK National Screening Committee concluded in 2010 that screening for Alzheimer’s ‘should not be offered’ as it failed to find evidence that it would be beneficial. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘We agree with the Screening Committee that there is no justification for screening the whole population for Alzheimer’s.’ However, Andrew Chidgey, from the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘Population screening is inappropriate, but asking older people at high risk about their memory is vital. 'Suggesting people are kept in the dark is a retrograde step. The medical profession must not bury its head in the sand over tackling the condition.’","Dr Chris Fox believes patients with minority problems could drain NHS resources .

Twice as fast: Dymista treats hay fever symptoms of a running nose, sneezing and itchy eyes . A nasal spray that claims to treat hay fever twice as fast as existing medication has been launched as pollen levels hit a springtime peak. Dymista spray contains two drugs which work differently to treat the misery-making symptoms of a runny nose, sneezing and itchy eyes. It combines a corticosteroid and an antihistamine – normally taken as tablets – which scientists say work more effectively together than alone. Trial data of 4,000 patients shows the spray relieves symptoms within five days, up to three days faster than when the drugs are used individually. Until now the medications have been prescribed separately. From today the Dymista combination will be available from GPs and specialist doctors, although not all hay fever patients are likely to get it. Around one in four people has hay fever – also known as seasonal allergic rhinitis – but the spray is targeted at moderate-to-severe sufferers. It will be a matter of clinical judgement whether a patient's symptoms are bad enough to qualify for the spray, which will cost the NHS £19 for a month's treatment. With the Met Office forecasting high pollen levels throughout England on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, many sufferers will discover whether their current medication works. Maureen Jenkins, of charity Allergy UK, said: 'People often think of hay fever as a 'nuisance' condition, causing little more than a runny nose and itchy eyes. Relief: 'Many people cannot control their symptoms, despite the wide range of treatments available' 'Unfortunately, the reality is that . hay fever and allergic rhinitis can have a prolonged impact on quality . of life by preventing people from sleeping, working, studying and even . carrying out simple everyday tasks. 'Many . people cannot control their symptoms, despite the wide range of . treatments available. These people should talk to their doctor or a . specialist to assess the severity of their disease and receive adequate . treatment for symptom control.' Previous research found schoolchildren severely affected by symptoms risk dropping a grade in summer exams. The Dymista spray contains azelastine, which blocks natural substances called histamines that trigger allergic symptoms, and fluticasone to reduce swelling and inflammation in the nasal passages. Among possible minor side effects is drowsiness, nasal dryness and mild nosebleeds, although the majority of users are unaffected. Allergy: The recent sunny spells have 'rapidly brought different pollens into play', experts have said . Patients taking Dymista should expect it to work within five days – up to three days faster than when single drugs are used. Dr Glenis Scadding, consultant physician in rhinology and allergy, at the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital in London, said hay fever sufferers should get treatment as early as possible, particularly given the delayed start to the season. The recent sunny spells have rapidly brought different pollens into play, she said, adding: 'This new spray offers a novel approach because we know that antihistamine given via the nose is twice as effective as oral treatment, and when given with a steroid they work together remarkably well. 'I really hope GPs will use this for patients with the worst symptoms – they tend to be those that end up in their surgeries in despair because they can't control them with over-the-counter products.'","Dymista combines corticosteroid and antihistamine, normally taken as pills .

Thousands of women with spinal fractures - causing the telltale shape of dowager’s hump - could benefit from a new balloon treatment, claim doctors. The procedure uses a balloon-like device to create space between fractured bones in the spine which is then injected with cement. It strengthens the bone and reduces the curvature of the spine, leaving patients pain-free within a few hours. Thousands of women with spinal fractures - causing the telltale shape of dowager's hump - could benefit from a new balloon treatment, claim doctors . The £3,000 procedure called balloon kyphoplasty has been given the go-ahead for widespread use on the NHS by the rationing body Nice. It has been approved along with a similar treatment called vertebroplasty, in which cement is injected into the solid part of the spine, for patients with the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis. At least 120,000 spinal fractures are triggered by the disease each year, often leading to a loss of height and hunched upper back, shuffling walk, breathing problems, chronic back pain and even premature death. People afflicted by spinal fractures visit their GPs 14 times more than patients of a similar age.Most cases are treated with strong painkillers, bed rest, physiotherapy, back bracing or major surgery. But experts believe approval for the new procedures will revolutionise the treatment of spinal fractures, mostly in women. Professor Opinder Sahota, professor in orthogeriatric medicine at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust said ‘Treating these fractures with balloon kyphoplasty could potentially save lives and is a cost effective way of preventing people from lingering in pain. ‘If managed properly, patients can be relieved from acute back pain, reduce the number of times they visit their doctor and regain their independence. ‘We need to make sure that this procedure becomes the standard of care for osteoporotic spinal fractures and ensure more patients have access to it as only 800 spinal fractures during 2010/2011 were treated with it in the whole of England and Wales.’ It strengthens the bone and reduces the curvature of the spine, leaving patients pain-free within a few hours . Balloon kyphoplasty is performed by inserting two small balloon-like devices into the fractured vertebra where they are inflated slowly until normal bone height is restored. When withdrawn, cement can be injected into the cavity that has been left, strengthening the bone with permanent results. It can be carried out under local anaesthetic and sedation, with the patient usually back on their feet and pain-free within hours. A trial published in The Lancet in 2009 suggested the procedure was so successful it should be used as an early treatment for vertebral compression fractures. The data, combined with other research showing a cut in premature death rates, was used during a two-year assessment by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence which led to its approval. Previously Nice had decided the procedures were safe but now it says that as they provide ‘benefits to patients and value for money, they ought to be offered to patients when appropriate.’ Professor Terence O’Neill, Chair of the National Osteoporosis Society’s Clinical and Scientific Committee said ‘Vertebral fractures can have a devastating impact on people’s lives. ‘While most fractures heal on their own a small number do not and cause persistent and severe pain. For those affected vertebroplasty and percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty offers real hope of improvement in their pain and quality of life.’ Professor Carole Longson, Director of the Health Technology Evaluation Centre at NICE, said ‘We’re pleased to recommend vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, two treatments that can help to strengthen fractured bone and reduce pain. ‘Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures can have a major impact on quality of life, and can be painful and disabling. ‘High doses of painkillers can also cause significant adverse effects, which can add to the distress and loss of self-esteem caused by the symptoms.'","Procedure uses balloon-like device to create space between fractured bones .

Work that is physically demanding may boost your chances of suffering heart disease compared with desk jobs, claim researchers. Doing a hard day's work increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by 20 per cent more than office workers, with the risk increasing with the amount of exertion involved. The surprising find by Greek researchers runs contrary to official guidelines in most western countries which recommend physical activity to stave off heart attacks. At risk: People who do physically demanding jobs such as bricklaying are more likely to have heart problems . A second study from Belgium and Denmark showed that exercise in a gym improved the coronary health of office workers but had a detrimental effect on those who already carried out manual labour as part of their job. Dr Demosthenes Panagiotakos, who led the Greek study, said people in physically demanding jobs could be under extra stress, were lower paid and might have less access to healthcare. He said it was unclear why hard work increased heart disease risk, when greater physical activity was normally linked to a lower risk. But the higher risk experienced by manual workers should make them targets for prevention by healthcare staff, he added. Making things worse: People who have physically demanding jobs increase their chance of heart disease if they work out at the gym as well . Dr Els Clays, who led the Belgian and Danish study, said 'The results of this study suggest that additional physical activity during leisure time in those who are already physically exhausted from their daily occupation does not induce a 'training' effect but rather an overloading effect on the cardiovascular system.' The studies were presented yesterday at a meeting of the European Society of Cardiology in Rome. In the UK people are advised to do 150 minutes of moderate activity such as gardening, dancing or brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise including playing sport, running or aerobics every week. Three out of four Britons fail to achieve this. The study by Dr Panagiotakos, Associate Professor of Biostatistics-Epidemiology at Harokopio University, Athens, looked at 250 patients who suffered a first stroke and 250 who had a first heart attack, and they were compared with a control group of 500 healthy people. Stroke and heart patients were more likely to have a physically demanding jobs than those in the control group - with the more demanding jobs carrying the greatest risk, said the researchers. Having a sedentary job led to a 20 per cent lower risk of a heart attack or stroke. In a second study investigators in Belgium and Denmark looked at more than 14,000 middle-aged men who did not have heart disease and followed them for three years on average. They found physically demanding work was a risk factor for developing coronary heart disease. They also found that men in physical jobs who also did moderate to high levels of exercise in their spare time had a fourfold higher risk of heart disease. Dr Clays said 'From a public health perspective it is very important to know whether people with physically demanding jobs should be advised to engage in leisure time activity.'","People in physically demanding jobs more at risk than office workers .

The young Margaret Roberts manoeuvred her way out of a fledgling relationship by setting her amorous admirer up with her older sister. She also danced through Oxford with another suitor as a young student. These are just some of the astonishing stories to emerge in a new authorised biography of Baroness Thatcher. A new biography by Charles Moore, former editor of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph, reveals details of two relationships the future Prime Minister had before Denis - to which she never previously admitted. The biography draws on a cache of some 150 intimate and revealing letters written by Margaret to her sister Muriel. Roberts family: from left to right, Muriel, Alfred, Beatrice and Margaret . Growing up in Grantham, Margaret apparently had no boyfriends, and her first relationship began after she went to Somerville College, Oxford to read chemistry in October 1943. Tony Bray was an undergraduate at Brasenose College whom she met through the Oxford University Conservative Assocation in the autumn of 1944. They were both 18, and she was slightly older than him, Moore records in Margaret Thatcher, The Authorised Biography Volume One: Not For Turning. Tony was a public-school-educated Army cadet who was pursuing a special six-month course devised to combine military training with lectures on the 'general sciences'. Tony found Margaret thoughtful, serious, with a degree of loneliness, but nonetheless a good conversationalist. He said he was impressed with her unusual enthusiasm for politics. He was also taken with her appearance and dress sense, describing her as plump and well-built but never-the-less attractive. Tony Bray realised that Margaret Roberts was serious about pursuing her political career, which would take her to mount an unsuccessful campaign in Dartford for its safe Labour seat . Conforming to the mores of the day the pair did not go around as an item, but would have tea in one another’s rooms, where Tony was impressed with her cooking of crumpets. Tony said that it was his impression from the way that Margaret kissed that she had had no boyfriend before, but she showed a delight in physical intimacy. However they never slept together. At the 21st birthday party of a Grantham schoolfriend in December 1944 she arrived carrying a carnation. She told her friends a man had given her the flower, but never revealed his name - Tony Bray. It was at that party that she also confided in her friends that she wanted to become a Member of Parliament. In March 1945, back in Grantham for the Easter vacation, Margaret wrote to her sister with details of every dance she had been to and her letter adopted a noticeably more animated tone than previous rather matter-of-fact ones. The approach of victory meant suddenly, after years of war, college balls could go ahead again. Margaret went to five dances that month. One in particular stood out for her - the Randolph Ball at the Randolph Hotel, for which Tony hired a car and took her for a meal at the Crown and Thistle pub in Abingdon first. She borrowed a royal blue velvet cloak for the occasion which matched a blue dress she had. Defeated - this time: the future Prime Minister congratulates Norman Dodds, Labour MP for Dartford, on his win. The new biography shows her to have been dismayed when women talked only about domestic matters and did not share her passion for politics . Tony presented her with eight carnations 'sent for me from London so with the front part of my hair piled up on top Jean and Mary [Oxford friends] said I looked simply smashing. I felt absolutely on top of the world as we walked through the lounge at the Crown and Thistle and everyone looked up and stared.' After the long years of wartime deprivation she described, in detail, what they ate and drank: gin and grapefruit, then a thick creamy soup followed by pigeon and a chocolate sweet, served with Moussec. She then informed her sister, in case she didn't know, that Moussec was a sparkling champagne. They reached the elaborately decked out Randolph at a quarter to nine, by which time the dancefloor was already packed. The Duchess of Marlborough arrived soon after they did. She enjoyed the refreshments and she concluded it was the best and biggest ball she had ever been to. Asked about it 60 years later Tony remembered buying the carnations and, when reminded of Margaret’s blue dress, broke down in tears, saying the evening had been very special. It was decided that Tony should meet her parents, so preparations began for him to come to their home above the shop in Grantham - a significant step. In old age he recounted that he and Margaret never discussed the question of marriage, and he had reservations about doing so because then a man could still be sued for breaking off an engagement. Tony, who had noticed the strain of financing Margaret's time at university, found the Roberts shop a modest business establishment. He found her parents very proper. By now Tony's six-month course at Oxford was over and he was sent to Bovington Camp in Dorset and various other military establishments until being posted to Germany in 1946. His letters to her became less and less frequent, to the point where Margaret wrote to his mother, whom she had . 'Asked about it 60 years later Tony Bray . remembered buying the carnations and, when reminded of Margaret’s blue . dress, broke down in tears, saying the evening had been very special.' never met, to ask what had happened to him. Margaret’s sister Muriel simply believed Tony believed was snobbish and looked down on Margaret's family. Tony, disagreed - he said his concerns about her background centred on its seriousness. Moore commented in an interview that although the book was written at Lady Thatcher's invitation, she could nonetheless be 'evasive', particularly when it came to her private life. So she told him she had had no boyfriends before Denis. And when asked specifically about Tony, she acknowledged the details but would not add any detail. They met again and had a few more dates in 1949 but he realised she was determined to embark on her political career and the relationship fizzled out. Tony, a widower, lives in a nursing home. Meanwhile by 1949 Margaret met two other men who would shape her - and her sister's - future. At a dinner after a meeting to introduce her as the parliamentary candidate for Dartford, a safe Labour seat, she met a prominent local businessman: 'a Major Thatcher, who has a flat in London (age about 36, plenty of money)...not a very attractive creature – very reserved but quite nice'. But he was not the only man to show an interest in her. At a Colchester Conservative party earlier that month, she met an Essex farmer of Scottish origin, William Cullen, who was determined to ask her out. She described him in a letter to her sister as quite ardent while driving her home.  and she confided 'I’m afraid he’s going to be an awful nuisance.' She didn't get on with his Scottish accent but was interested to see the family farm. Curiously, it appears that she, sensing that he was keener on her than vice versa, wanted to introduce him to her sister Muriel. She wrote to her: 'Went to the flicks yesterday with my farmer friend and got him all primed up to meet you sometime. I showed him the snapshot of you and I [sic] together – and he said he could scarcely tell the difference so I should think we could easily substitute me for you. When can you come down for a weekend?' But Willie continued to pursue Margaret, giving her expensive Crêpe de Chine scent and visiting her every other day when she was ill. One gift survives: a blackcalf handbag. Change of heart: Margaret's sister Muriel married William Cullen - the farmer who had originally pursued her . She wrote to Muriel that it had cost £7-3s - which she felt was not too expensive - which her conscience wouldn’t have allowed - but enough of a gift for her to add: 'I’ll have to hang on with William for a while longer now!' She 'hung on with William' for long enough to meet his family, though she was dismayed that the wives only talked of domestic matters, so after the dinner she remained with the men. Margaret carried on arranging meetings between Willie and Muriel, and after a few months he and Margaret talked things through on the phone. A few months later, Willie and Muriel announced their engagement. They married in April 1950 and Margaret was their only bridesmaid. During her time at Oxford, she wrote many letters to her sister Muriel in which she frequently complained of the difficulty of affording clothes. In one letter she expressed frustration that her weight was not dipping below about 10st 4lbs. She asked her sister for tips on how to reduce 'the area of the seat and control of the tummy muscles – oh and also reduction and uplift of bust'. Earlier, while a sixth-former at Kesteven and Grantham Girls School, one her scientific experiments almost ended up gassing her fellow-pupils. Lorna Smith, one of her contemporaries, recalled how ink had been spilt on the classroom parquet floor. Margaret decided that the rapidly increasing black stain should be tackled with bleaching-powder and have hydrochloric acid - that had been stolen from the lab - poured on it. Lorna scrubbed away furiously, and the boards began to recover, but suddenly she was almost overcome by the fumes and had to rush out doors. Margaret had inadvertently created chlorine gas. The teachers heard the girls' violent coughing but were too worried about them to be angry. Lorna believed her lungs had not been the same since.","Future PM's first love revealed: Tony Bray an 18-year-old Army cadet .

Speaking out: Baroness Hale, the only female Supreme Court judge, said the legal profession is guilty of 'unconscious sexism' Britain's most senior female judge has slammed the legal profession for failing to give top jobs to women, blaming 'unconscious sexism'. Speaking at the London School of Economics, Baroness Hale of Richmond, the only female Supreme Court justice, said talented female candidates are missing out on senior positions because employers are not used to being around women. She said: 'There's an awful lot of unconscious . assumptions and judgments that are made when people don't realise that . that's what they're doing. 'The . more used they are to having women, and people from ethnic minorities, . around, the less that's a problem because they know how we behave. 'But if you hardly ever see a woman, you don't really know how to assess somebody who's a candidate,' The Independent reports. Lady Hale argued the profession is still weighted in favour of well-known lawyers and that it would benefit from greater diversity. 'It is tiring to have to be talking about why we have so few women in the higher ranks of the judiciary in this country when most countries in the world have solved the problem. It is a bore,' she said. 'I would like us not to have to talk about it, but we do have to talk about it because the present situation is terrible.' Lady Hale, who was appointed a High Court judge in 1994, said that she approved of a tiebreaker system which would see people appoint a candidate from a minority background if all applicants were seen as equally qualified. She described such a system as 'affirmative action' rather than 'positive discrimination'. Closed doors: Baroness Hale is the only female judge to sit at the Supreme Court . Law Society figures show that 47 per cent of solicitors and 35 per cent of barristers are female, and that women have accounted for more than half of entrants to the profession since 1993. But there are only 21 women judges out of a total of 148 in the Court of Appeal and High Court. According to research by Laurence Simons, a specialist legal recruitment company, at the start of this year, the average pay for male lawyers – both inhouse and in private practice – was down £5,000 on 2011, while pay among female lawyers was up by nearly £1,400. Despite that rise, the average female lawyer was still paid £51,396 less per year than her average male colleague, with total remuneration about two thirds that of men.","Baroness Hale says women are missing out on senior positions .

Now, however, the eyes of the world are upon the tiny Russian republic of Dagestan as it emerged that it is at the centre of an FBI investigation into the Boston marathon bombings. Investigators are poring over the social media accounts of dead bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev after discovering he had posted an online link to videos by a Dagestani militant jihadist. Scroll down for videos . The eyes of the west are on Dagestan and its capital Makhachlaka, pictured, after links between bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and a Dagestani jihadist were revealed . Zubeidat Tsarnaeva (left), mother of terrorists Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, walks near her home in Makhachkala, Dagestan, southern Russia, as CNN correspondent Nick Paton Walsh (right) says the state is a haven for Islamic militants who now have their sights trained on America as their main target . They hope that examining the relationship between the two may answer the biggest unanswered question over last week's fatal bombings: what was the motive? Dagestan is translated as 'land of the mountains' and was the country where the Tsarnaevs, including Tamerlan's brother and accomplice Dzhokhar, moved more than a decade ago before they travelled to the US. It is still the home of the bombers' parents and has been placed squarely at the centre of the inquiry . An ethnically-diverse Islamic Russian republic with a population of nearly 3million, Dagestan is one of five such republics which include its neighbour Chechnya (the homeland of Boston suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev), making up the northern caucasus of Russia. These Islamic Russian republics have strong historic ties with Al Qaeda but, while conflicts in Chechnya have been well-documented, Dagestan is new territory even for the FBI, who are having to acquaint themselves with a remote state riddled with jihadists with an increasingly global view. Terrorists who once saw Russia as the enemy now have their sights trained on America as their main target, according to Nick Paton Walsh, international correspondent with CNN who has visited the states frequently over the past few years. Mr Paton Walsh, who is based in Beirut but is currently working in Dagestan, says the state is a haven for Islamic militants who were forced out of Chechnya by the second Chechen war. He told MailOnline: 'After the second Chechen war Russian forces . very strongly and violently went through towns and villages in Chechnya . pillaging any remnants of the military there. 'This . resulted in a great strength of feeling because . many young men and families had lost people dear to them, so more . extremists grew up.  Militants were squeezed out of Chechnya and many . went to the . east, to Dagestan. 'There . was a large uptake in violence and the ones that remained . behind have radicalised further.  Since 2006 their rhetoric has become . more about global jihad rather than about fighting Russia.' Brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were children when they left Chechnya for Dagestan in 2001 . This video reportedly of Dagestani jihadist Gadzhimurad Dolgatov was linked to on a YouTube channel believed to be Tamerlan Tsarnaev's . This map of the Russian caucasus shows Dagestan to the east and Chechnya to its west . 'The people spouting this in . Dagestan are not as potent as those in Afghanistan or Pakistan; Russia . has attempted to suppress militants.  But the heavy-handed nature . of their attempts to do so are said to be fuelling the militants here. 'They talk about fighting back against law enforcement, so there is the potential for a cycle that feeds itself.' The . Russian caucasus has strong links with Al Qaeda: 9/11 conspirator . Zacharias Moussaoui trained in Chechnya, and Al Qaeda leader Ayman . Al-zawahiri was arrested by the Russians when he was discovered trying . to enter Dagestan in 1997.  And terrorists in the Islamic republics . there are known to receive money from Saudi Arabia. Gadzhimurad . Dolgatov, whose online jihadist calls to arms were linked to by . Tamerlan Tsarnaev's YouTube account before being deleted, was a key . local figure in the Islamic extremist movement before he was gunned down . by Russian security forces late last year.  He was also active in the . capital city Makhachkala last year when Tsarnaev spent six months there, . visiting from the U.S. Mr . Paton Walsh, who was Moscow correspondent for four years, said this . link was key to the FBI's investigations into a motive for the Boston . bombing suspects. 'Dolgatov posted a lot of views online, saying it was the duty of Muslims to promise a jihad, and saying they had to rise up and form a more Islamic state,' he said. 'We don't know if the two men knew each other, but the YouTube link shows that Tamerlan was interested in Dolgatov, who was the well-known extremist in town. Women pass by the Heart of Chechnya mosque in Grozny in Chechnya . 'Dolgatov was the local emir, a jihadist who was a sort of chief of local youths in Makhachkala.  He had his own group of guys who would be out training in the woods with guns, and who would attack police, take bribes from local people - like a local Islamic mafia.' Mr Paton Walsh said the fact that both Dolgatov, who was shot dead by Russian security forces in December last year, and Tamerlan were in Makhachkala at the same was significant. 'Dolgatov was a heavy jihadist and was visiting the mosques in the city.  Tamerlan was visiting mosques in the same city that Dolgatov was visiting mosques in. 'We don't know if the two men knew each . other or what the extent of that relationship was, but we do know that Dolgatov was a reasonably . forceful presence in Makhachkala and was active there at the same time . that Tamerlan was there. 'Tamerlan was in Makachkala for a good number of months for the early part of the year and while there's nothing to say concretely that they met each other, Tamerlan would have had an interest in the well-known extremist in town.' Tamerlan's family came to Dagestan in 2001 from Chechnya which they left before the second Chechen war.  The children show up on school registers there between September 2001-March 2002, then it is believed the family moved to the U.S., possibly via Kyrgystan. The mother, father and aunt of Tamerlan and Dzhokhar still live in Dagestan, and all have expressed their outrage and disbelief that the boys would have been involved in any bombings.

Dark chocolate is rich in flavanols, which can lower blood pressure - although these can also be found in blueberries, tomatoes and onions . Enjoying dark chocolate could have the added benefit of lowering blood pressure, researchers . claim. A review of studies involving nearly a thousand people found . those consuming up to 100g of chocolate with a high cocoa content had a . significant drop in their blood pressure. Researchers believe the antioxidant compound flavanol is the . active ingredient providing heart benefits, according to a review published in . The Cochrane Library. These findings follow a study earlier this week suggesting . that cocoa may benefit the brain in old age and protect against diseases such . as Alzheimer’s. Scientists reviewed data from 20 short-term trials in which . 850 participants were involved and discovered those who consumed up to 100g of . flavanol-rich chocolate or cocoa powder a day significantly reduced their blood . pressure when compared to those who consumed flavanol-free products. Flavanol contains nitric oxide which causes blood vessels in . the body to dilate and relax resulting in a drop in blood pressure. Its health benefits were first recognised when it was . revealed that indigenous people who drank cocoa every day from San Blas Island . in Central America have normal blood pressure regardless of age. Cocoa is found in much higher concentrations in dark than . milk chocolate. UK Blood Pressure Association Trustee, Professor Gareth . Beevers said: ‘Increasing your flavanol intake may be beneficial if you have a . high blood pressure however I wouldn’t recommend it for people suffering from . cardiovascular diseases who should stick to traditional treatments.’ People with high blood pressure, which affects 1 in 3 adults . in the UK, are three times more likely to develop heart disease and stroke than . those with a healthy blood pressure. Ideally adults’ blood pressure should be below 140/85 mmHg. Around 30 per cent of people in England have high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart attack and stroke . The top number measures systolic pressure, which corresponds . to the surge of blood that occurs with every heartbeat. The results of the study show that flavanol-rich chocolate . reduced blood pressure by up to 4 mmHg of systolic pressure which could make a . difference for someone with high blood pressure who may need medication. But don’t reach for the chocolate bar just yet - flavanol . can also be found in diet friendly foods such as blueberries, tomatoes and . onions as well as green tea. Professor Beevers adds: ‘I would also prioritise restricting . salt in your diet if you are trying to lower your blood pressure as the data . from these studies are more powerful.’ Additionally the amount of flavanol varies greatly depending . on the type of chocolate, which means milk chocolate lovers may be . disappointed. High cocoa content, low sugar chocolate came out top in . terms of reducing blood pressure with overweight and obese participants . experiencing greater reductions in blood pressure after consuming low sugar . chocolate. Lead researcher Karin Ried, from the National Institute of Integrative Medicine in Melbourne, Australia said: ‘The small reduction we saw over the short term might . complement other treatment options and might contribute to reducing the risk of . cardiovascular disease. ‘We’ll also need to see long term trials, including effects . on the risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease, before we can come to . conclusions regarding clinical outcomes and potential side effects of long-term . consumption.'","Cocoa is the key ingredient and is found in much higher concentrations in dark than .

It is also a popular tourist site and many regard it as the national symbol for Nepal. The holy site attracts pilgrims from all over the world. In 1979, Boudha became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Prayer services are held in the stupa and surrounding gompas and when the sun sets, the whole community comes out and a religious observance is held around the stupa. The . protesters are calling for Beijing to allow greater religious freedom . and the return from exile of their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who . lives in India. Tibetan exiles say 99 of the protesters set themselves alight in ethnic Tibetan areas inside China. Another man died after setting himself on fire last March in the Indian capital of New Delhi. Police official Keshav Adhikari said police and residents were able to put out the flames and rush the man to a hospital. Dozens of police in riot gear surrounded the hospital where the man lay in critical condition. Adhikari said the man had yet to be identified, but appeared to be about 21 years old. Wednesday . marked the third and one of the most important days of the Losar . festival, which is celebrated by the Tibetan community. Many Tibetans in . Nepal visit Boudhanath for the event. Prasant . Tamang, a waiter at the Golden Eye Cafe, said he found a gasoline . bottle, a jacket and a bag in the cafe's bathroom. Tamang said the man . appeared normal and calm. 'He looked like the hundreds of . Tibetans who came to Boudhanath today and I did not suspect he was going . to set himself on fire,' Tamang said. Penpa . Tsering, speaker of the Tibetan exile parliament in India, said that . with China cracking down on self-immolations inside Tibet, Tibetans were . beginning to move their protests to other countries. 'It's unfortunate, and each life is . precious, but regular modes of protest are taken away from Tibetans, and . they are expressing their discontent in this extreme way,' he said.

Nepal also allows Tibetans to pass . through Nepal, traveling from their homeland to Dharmasala, India, where . the Dalai Lama lives and the government in exile is based. Communist troops occupied the Himalayan region of Tibet in 1951. Beijing says it has been part of China for centuries, but Tibetans say it was independent for much of that time.

Dale Oen, who took an emotional men's 100 metres breaststroke gold medal at last year's world championships in Shanghai, collapsed in a shower on Monday evening. A silver medallist at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, he had just finished a 'light' swim at a high-altitude training camp in the town of Flagstaff as part of his national team's preparations for July's Games. Tragic death: Alexander Dale Oen was found collapsed in a bathroom after colleagues noticed he had been longer than usual . The Norwegian Swimming Federation said Dale Oen had only a light training session on Monday and played golf earlier that day. But teammates became worried when the swimmer spent an unusually long time in the shower and entered his bathroom after he failed to respond to their knocks on the door.

The couple attended the Royal Film Performance of 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' at the Odeon Leicester Square in London earlier this month . When your long-term partner and father of your two children becomes a bona fide Hollywood star, it’s hard to imagine what the downside might be. But for Amanda Abbington there were definite drawbacks when Martin Freeman won the part of Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. True, it would give them rewards and riches beyond their imagining, but it also meant he would have to spend 18 months in New Zealand filming. ‘That trip to New Zealand is a . monster – 26 hours and three planes,’ says Amanda, 38, an easy-going, . approachable blonde with a hearty laugh and a down-to-earth sense of . humour. ‘When Martin was offered The Hobbit, we talked about it and he did think about turning it down.’ Initially . Freeman, 41, did reject the role. Peter Jackson’s prequel to The Lord . Of The Rings may be the world’s biggest movie franchise, but the actor . was locked into playing Doctor Watson in another series of Sherlock. Then, in an unprecedented move, the director agreed to halt filming for . six weeks so that Freeman could return to Britain to complete the BBC . drama. Amanda says: ‘Peter . Jackson said he couldn’t think of anyone else to play the part. I told . Martin he had to do it and we would get through it. We said we’d speak . to each other on the phone and it would be OK. But it was hard. Afterwards, we came to the conclusion we’d never, ever do that again.’ Martin Freeman has had to move to New Zealand while he plays the part of Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's new movie . Although . Amanda was left behind  at their home in Hertfordshire looking after . Joe, seven, and four-year-old Grace, she insists it was more difficult . for Freeman. Of course being a hobbit isn’t easy.  There’s the large feet – it took two people to help Freeman put on the gnarly, flipper-like appendages that went up to his thighs. Then there’s the ears: ‘I asked him to bring a pair home,’ says Amanda, ‘although he hasn’t put them on yet. I think he’s had enough of them for now.’ Amanda has just won her own starring role in ITV's new department-store drama Mr Selfridge . And that’s not to mention the troll . snot. Freeman has said: ‘Because of continuity, you’ve got to be in wet . snot and then the remnants of drying snot. That’s a lot of days. It’s . kind of like a hair gel. Sticky. Very cold. ‘We were on the side of a mountain . with wind machines going and rain pouring down, and our wig glue and . hair gel was going into our eyes. Peter would say, “Martin, can you open . your eyes a little more?” I genuinely could not. It was comically . uncomfortable.’ Amanda, the . only child of Patsy and John, a cab driver, says: ‘It was harder for . Martin. I had our home and his things around me, whereas he was in a . foreign country without his children, without me. 'I . managed to get out three times with the kids. Then Martin came back to . film Sherlock and for Christmas, so we had little pockets of time.’ While Freeman would call home . complaining that he’d been ‘hanging upside-down all day and I’ve got . bloody ears on’, normal life – with all its trials – carried on. And one . of the hardest moments came when she found a lump in one of her . breasts. She says: ‘It turned out to be nothing but it was frightening. It’s not knowing that’s the scary thing. 'Your . immediate reaction is ‘‘that’s it’’. We immediately think the worst. I . had to steel myself to ring the doctor, then wait a couple of weeks for . the results. Martin was going to come back but I was fine.’ Freeman initially turned down the role of Bilbo Baggins but was persuaded after Peter Jackson agreed to halt filming so he could finish a drama he was working on . Amanda . understands the pressures, as she is also an actress. While she may be . known as Mrs Hobbit in some quarters, she has just won her own starring . role in ITV’s new department-store drama Mr Selfridge. The ten-part serial is being billed . as Downton Abbey with tills, yet Amanda admits she very nearly didn’t . take the part (as Miss Mardle, Head of Accessories) because Freeman was . still in New Zealand. She explains: ‘I went for the . audition and the next day they said, “You’ve got it.” I dreaded telling . Martin because I was due to go out there. 'We . hadn’t seen each other for four months, which was the longest time we’d . been apart. I was having to juggle work, make sure the kids were OK, . make sure Martin was OK. I wondered whether I should do it but Martin . said, ‘‘You’ve got to do it.’’ ’ The pair starred together as a married couple in the 2007 BBC drama The Debt . The . couple met on the set of a movie called Men Only in 2000, although . Amanda had already seen the actor in the sketch show Bruisers and . ‘really fancied him’. It was the year before Freeman found fame playing hapless Tim in The Office. Amanda says: ‘I was sitting in the . make-up bus moaning about not having a boyfriend when a call went over . the radio for Martin Freeman to have his make-up taken off. He walked on . to the bus and I thought, “Oh God, you’re lovely.” ‘We . just sort of ended up hanging out with each other. I left early and . then got a message from him the next day saying, “Hi, you left and I . hadn’t finished flirting with you which I thought was a little bit rude. I’ll see you later.” ‘We went out on a date that day to a pub in Crouch End. It’s the only time we’ve ever been to a pub. ‘We moved in together a few months after that. He is my love. I know it sounds sickly, but he is.’ While . she enjoys the security Freeman’s success has given them, she is . refreshingly uninterested in the trappings that go with it. At the London premiere of The Hobbit a . fortnight ago, she wore a dress from Warehouse, while she often drives . them to awards ceremonies in her Mini Cooper. She recalls: ‘At the Baftas last year I was so pleased because I . managed to get a parking space within a  hundred yards of the red . carpet. It was serendipity.’ Peter Jackson said he couldn't think of anyone else to play the part of the hobbit . She does the driving, as Freeman hasn’t . passed his test. It’s fair to say that theirs is a household untouched . by Hollywood success. Amanda . says: ‘Any kind of normality is just heavenly. He might change, he’s . still got two Hobbit films to come out so there’s some room for . manoeuvre. But I don’t think he will – he’s very grounded. He still does . the ironing; he’s  better than me. ’There are no pangs about him working with Gwyneth Paltrow and Penelope Cruz. ‘It’s not an issue,’ she says. Nor is there any envy at Freeman’s success. ‘I think he’s such a good actor so it’s very easy to say, fair play, you absolutely deserve to be where you are. It would seem really petty to think, oh well, he’s done this, why haven’t I?’ However, Mr Selfridge could provide her with the breakthrough from working actor to household name. She says: ‘I’m hoping my career will start to take off a bit more now.’ Not that she wants fame – only recognition. For she, more than most, understands the nerve-racking nature of success on such a grand scale. ‘I do slightly worry,’ she admits. ‘It’s daunting. The Hobbit’s a massive film but we’ve been together for a long time and whatever life throws at us, we’ll be able to get through it.’ She doesn’t need to say the obvious – that if they got through that  18 months apart, they can get through anything.","Amanda Abbington and Martin Freeman met on the set of Men Only in 2000 .

At least a million children and teenagers are to be vaccinated against measles in an attempt to stop expected outbreaks in England. Some will never have had a jab, while others have only had the first of two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The £20million campaign follows a big rise in cases in South Wales, where public health officials have been running clinics to increase protection rates. Many of those affected are teenagers . who missed out on vaccination in the late 1990s and early 2000s when . parents were concerned about a link between MMR and autism that has . since been discredited. Vaccinations: Figures show there were 587 confirmed measles cases in England in the first three months of this year, more than three times the 168 cases in the same period of 2012 . Figures from Public Health England . (PHE) show there were 587 confirmed measles cases in England in the . first three months of this year, more than three times the 168 cases in . the same period of 2012. The highest number of cases is among ten to . 16-year-olds. Experts predict England’s total this year will exceed the 1,920 cases confirmed in 2012 unless action is taken. Professor David Salisbury, director of . immunisation at the Department of Health, said: ‘The situation in . Swansea, I believe, is a wake-up call for parents – for parents who for . whatever reason, quite a few years ago, chose not to vaccinate their . children and for whom these days vaccines aren’t really things that they . think about very much.’ He added: ‘You have to prevent measles . and that means we need to get ahead before we have got large numbers of . cases and large outbreaks occurring in England.’ He said the country faced a potential . national health emergency without a catch-up campaign that will be . carried out by GPs, schools and community programmes until September. Around one third of a million ten to 16-year-olds who are not already vaccinated will be the ‘first priority’. A further third of a million children . in this age group need at least one more MMR jab to give them full . protection, along with a similar number above and below this age range. Protection: The £20million campaign follows a big rise in cases in south Wales, where public health officials have been running clinics to increase protection rates (file picture) Dr Mary Ramsay, PHE head of . immunisation, said there was particular concern about potential measles . outbreaks in London, the South and East of England where MMR vaccination . rates were historically lower than in the North. She said older children not vaccinated . as toddlers could ‘spread infection very effectively’, adding: ‘Measles . is not a mild illness. It is very unpleasant and can lead to serious . complications … with more than 100 children in England being . hospitalised so far this year.’ Speaking this morning on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she added that parents often think once their child is over the age of five they are not at risk from measles. ‘We are worried – this is not an epidemic in England yet as the cases we have had have been clustered, but there is the potential for outbreaks to happen in other areas as there are people who have not been vaccinated. We really want to get ahead of that and stop this happening across England. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today confirmed that his three sons Antonio, Alberto and Miguel have all had the MMR jab . ‘We have already done several things over the years (to get children vaccinated) and we ran a similar campaign in 2008. But the problem is people forget that their children are still at risk of measles over the age of five. ‘Although people are being reminded, they don’t realise that the measles risk doesn’t stop.’ She added that most children born today are vaccinated before they start school but the problem is a minority who were not immunised a decade ago at the height of the MMR scare. ‘We are trying to get at the very small proportion that are left who haven’t had the injection and they are quite difficult to find. We are going to be asking GPS to go through their records and contact parents both through the general practice and also through schools.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today confirmed that his three sons Antonio, Alberto and Miguel have all had the MMR jab, and said that he did not feel the need to 'cross his fingers' as he decided to have them vaccinated. Speaking on his Call Clegg phone-in show on LBC 97.3 radio, the Liberal Democrat leader said: 'The overwhelming advice is that this is the right thing to do to protect the health of your child. 'I think you have to have trust in the people who look at this. They have no axe to grind, they just want to do the right thing and come up with the right science. 'They have said very categorically that the concern about a link between MMR and other conditions is just not proven, and they say really explicitly that it is really bad for your children's health if you don't take this action. 'I really would urge parents, whatever your misgivings, do what people who know about this most say is right for your children - get that course of jabs done.'","The £20million campaign follows a big rise in cases in South Wales .

Fat-cat lawyers getting rich on criminal legal-aid cases are to have their fees slashed by almost a third under plans unveiled yesterday. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the best-paid QCs receive more than £500,000 a year courtesy of the taxpayer. But in ‘very high cost cases’, lasting more than 90 days, he intends to reduce payments by 30 per cent. Plans: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the best-paid QCs receive more than £500,000 a year courtesy of the taxpayer - but in 'very high cost cases', he intends to reduce payments . The current fees are £500 a day for advocacy, plus up to £150 an hour for preparation work. In 2010/11, six barristers received more than £500,000 each for defending suspected criminals at the taxpayer’s expense. Mr Grayling said: ‘We have an excellent tradition of legal aid and one of the best legal professions in the world. But we cannot close our eyes to the fact legal aid is still costing too much. ‘It is not free money - it is paid for by hard-working taxpayers, so we must ensure we get the very best value for every penny spent.’ The fee reduction is part of a string of measures designed to slash £220million from the criminal legal-aid bill, which is currently more than £1billion a year. In other measures, defendants living in households with a disposable income of £37,500 or more would not automatically be given legal aid. Mr Grayling also wants to see criminals pay for the cost of running courts out of their future earnings. Offenders can already be required to make payments to victims, the courts or other government agencies through a range of orders and fines. But there is currently no power to make them pay directly towards the running costs of the court, such as security and staff. Mr Grayling decided to act after seeing the sums paid to the highest-earning QCs. The largest legal-aid bills normally involve cases of money laundering, fraud or terrorism. The QC who earned the most from criminal legal aid in 2010/11 is a barrister who represents people accused of multi-million-pound tax frauds. John Charles Rees, based in Cardiff, was paid £554,152. The Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers, says the legal-aid totals may cover several years of work and include VAT. Bills are paid by the Government when a case is complete. In a wide-ranging review,  Mr Grayling also announced that there will be a further crackdown on civil legal aid. A residency test will be introduced to prevent legal aid going to immigrants who have lived in Britain for less than a year. And prisoners will be denied legal aid unless the case relates to their sentence. Mr Grayling said taxpayers’ money is being used for ‘unnecessary legal cases’ that could be dealt with by the prison service, such as which category of jail an inmate is being kept in. Solicitors criticised other plans to make them compete for some legal contracts in the future. Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, president of the Law Society, said: ‘We also think it is implausible that tendering will save the sort of sums of money the Treasury is looking for, and there is some doubt whether it will save anything at all.’ Last week, reforms to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act came into effect, removing large areas of law from the scope of civil legal aid. These included welfare and family law. Some law firms estimated that the reforms will reduce the number of people who qualify for legal aid by 75 per cent. Cambridge graduate: John Charles Rees QC has an 'enviable success rate' according to his practice website . The crackdown follows outrage that former fugitive Asil Nadir received more than £1million in legal aid while renting a £23,000-a-month London residence during his trial for stealing £28.8million from his Polly Peck empire in the 1980s. 'We cannot close our eyes to the fact legal aid is still costing too much. It is not free money – it is paid for by hard-working taxpayers, so we must ensure we get the very best value for every penny spent' Justice Secretary Chris Grayling . The former Tory donor, who was jailed for ten years last August, received £230,409 to pay solicitors and £641,072 for his barristers. A further £185,000 went on court costs known as disbursements. Other criminals who have milked the legal-aid system include convicted gangster Terry Adams, who got £4.7million, and the Connors family, the caravan park owners who kept homeless drug addicts and alcoholics as virtual slaves. The Connors family owned homes with hot tubs, a fleet of cars including a Rolls-Royce and a Mercedes, enjoyed Caribbean cruises and holidays in Mexico and Dubai, and had £500,000 in the bank. Yet they were still able to claim around £500,000 in legal aid. They received the payments because their assets were frozen and, pending prosecution, these cannot be taken into account when assessing a suspect’s wealth.","Chris Grayling says best-paid QCs get £500,000+ a year from taxpayer .

Professor Sir Roger Boyle told the BBC that care at the centre at the Leeds children's heart unit was 'on the edge of acceptability' A senior National Health Service executive has declared he would not want his daughter treated at the crisis-hit child heart unit in Leeds. Professor Sir Roger Boyle spoke out only days after the centre reopened after it was shut at short notice because of data he leaked on its comparative death rates. Sir Roger, who now oversees NHS death rate data but was national director for heart disease until 2011, said that care at Leeds was ‘on the edge of acceptability’. The father of a ten-year-old daughter, Amy, and three grown-up sons, he said: ‘I tell you that I have a young daughter, I would go somewhere else. I would go to Newcastle.’ His comments will alarm parents and enrage supporters of the unit at Leeds General Infirmary. They want him to be sacked, accusing him of  ‘conducting a cynical vendetta’. Paediatric heart surgery at Leeds  was suspended at the end of last month after data leaked by Sir Roger appeared to show death rates running at twice the national average. Surgeons at other units also raised concerns and parents told of children who were lucky to be alive. But others claimed the closure was politically motivated as it came just 24 hours after the High Court quashed plans to close the centre as part of measures to streamline  children’s heart services. The hospital insisted the data was incomplete and that full figures would confirm the unit to be safe.Surgery resumed earlier this week and NHS England said it was satisfied that immediate safety concerns had been dealt with. However, Sir Roger’s comments on  Radio 4’s The Report programme will reignite the controversy. He insisted that, despite safety assurances, a comprehensive analysis of the data showed the unit should remain under supervision. ‘We find they’re just on the edge of what we call an alert. ‘In other words, showing that they were right on the edge of acceptability,’ he said. Children's heart surgery at the hospital was suspended at the end of last month after data showed the unit had a death rate double that of other centres. It re-opened again on Wednesday . Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said that the quality of its  service had been independently  verified during a rapid review. A spokesman added: ‘This was publicly reconfirmed at a meeting of councillors in Leeds on Wednesday when the deputy medical director of NHS England reaffirmed that all child heart surgery units in England, including Leeds, are safe to undertake surgery.’ The Save Our Surgery campaign group said Sir Roger’s involvement in deciding which child heart units should close means he is far from impartial. His comments, added spokesman Sharon Cheng, were ‘extremely unhelpful and undermine the progress made over the last few days to begin to rebuild heart patients’ families’ trust and confidence’. Greg Mulholland, Liberal Democrat MP for Leeds North West, called for Sir Roger to be sacked.He said the remarks had caused huge and unnecessary distress to families as well as slurring the  reputation of those working at the unit. NHS medical director, Sir Bruce Keogh, took the decision to suspend treatment at the unit but said he now ‘disagreed’ with Sir Roger. ‘Having reviewed the unit, having reviewed the data, the performance in Leeds is in keeping with good national standards and I would be very happy to have my child operated upon in Leeds,’ said Sir Bruce. Leeds General Infirmary is at the centre of a long-running row over the future of children's heart services at the hospital. The NHS announced last July it wanted to close three units and keep seven open, the idea being to concentrate specialist services in fewer but larger centres that would give a higher quality of care for child heart patients. Those currently chosen to stay open are at Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle, Southampton and two London centres.Facing closure are units at Leicester’s Glenfield Hospital, London’s Royal Brompton and the Leeds site. This means patients in Yorkshire would be being forced to travel to Liverpool or Newcastle for treatment - a 150 or 200-mile round trip respectively. There is huge support for keeping child heart surgery in the Yorkshire and nearly 600,000 people signed a petition against closure of the unit, organised by the group Save Our Surgery (SOS). Last month, a High Court judge derailed plans to close the unit because of the ‘secretive’ approach of NHS chiefs. Mrs Justice Davies backed claims by SOS that the consultation process to decide which units should be axed was unfair because details of how a panel of experts marked individual hospitals were kept secret.Last month, she ruled the decision was 'unfair and legally flawed'. But within 24 hours, Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, had travelled to Leeds to suspend congenital heart surgery after data emerged suggesting it had a death rate twice the national average. He said the figures were among a 'constellation of reasons' behind the suspension.","Professor Sir Roger Boyle is the Government's former head of heart disease .
