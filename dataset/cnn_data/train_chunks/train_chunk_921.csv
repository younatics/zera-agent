"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . Minneapolis police have charged two parents in the suffocation death of their 6-week-old daughter found dead inside a laundry basket back in March. Cardie Jackson, 39, and her 40-year-old husband, Shonwta Jackson, were charged with second-degree murder Monday. Police say the baby suffocated in a laundry basket filled with a pillow and blankets where the newborn regularly slept. Preventable tragedy: Cardie and Shonwta Jackson's six-week-old baby girl was found dead inside a laundry basket pied with bedding, where she regularly slept . According to investigators, a nurse had given the couple information warning against including pillows or loose bedding in a baby’s sleep environment. The deceased little girl was the Jacksons’ 11th child. They had lost custody of nine children and a 2-year-old is in foster care. The state had required Cardie Jackson to show she could care for the 2-year-old when the child was born. The couple have a warrant out for their arrest, but as of Monday night they had not been taken into police custody. According to the criminal complaint obtained by The Minneapolis Star Tribune, Cardie Jackson called 911 on March 2 to report that her baby was not breathing. The mother of 11 children, ranging in age between six weeks and 16 years, told police that her husband woke up to use the restroom and found their youngest daughter unresponsive in a laundry basket next to their bed. Cardie Jackson admitted that the night before, she had been drinking and smoking marijuana during a house party. Mrs Jackson woke up at 3am to give her newborn formula, but she said the child was not very hungry, so she placed her back in her makeshift bed inside the laundry basket filled with adult-size bedding. A visiting nurse, who had been assigned to the family because the little girl was born four weeks premature, had provided the family with literature that described how they must use a firm mattress in a crib covered with a fitted sheet and emptied of stuffed toys, loose bedding and pillows. According to officials, the Jacksons had 11 children between 1992 and 2014, but by 2004 they had given up their parental rights to six of the kids.","Cardie Jackson, 39, and Shonwta Jackson, 40, charged with second-degree murder .

"By . Associated Press . and Mail online Reporter . Middle-income Americans are spending about $245,000 raising a child until adulthood, with families living in the Northeast taking on a greater burden, a new study has found. Those costs — food, housing, childcare and education — rose 1.8 percent over the previous year, according to the latest Agriculture Department's Expenditures on Children and Families report. As in the past, families in the urban Northeast will spend more than families in the urban South and rural parts of the US, or roughly $282,480. When adjusting for projected inflation, the report found that a child born last year could cost a middle-income family an average of about $304,480. Difference: This USAD chart shows it cost more than $245,000 to raise a child in 2013 compared with $198,000 in 1960 (in 2013 dollars) Outlays: This USAD chart shows how much middle-income American families spend raising their child, with housing comprising the biggest outlay . The USDA's annual report, based on the government's Consumer Expenditure Survey, found families were consistent in how they spent their money across all categories from 2012 to 2013. The costs associated with pregnancy or expenses accumulated after a child becomes an adult, such as college tuition, were not included. In 1960, the first year the report was issued, a middle-income family could spend about $25,230, equivalent to $198,560 in 2013 dollars, to raise a child until the age of 18. Housing costs remain the greatest child-rearing expense, as they did in the 1960s, although current-day costs like childcare were negligible back then. For middle-income families, the USDA found, housing expenses made up roughly 30 percent of the total cost of raising a child. Rising cost of living: Child-rearing expenses are increasing, with families spending about 16 percent of total expenditure on food (stock picture) Child care and education were the second-largest expenses, at 18 percent, followed by food at 16 percent. Expenses per child decrease as a family has more children, the report found, as families with three or more children spend 22 percent less per child than families with two children. That's because more children share bedrooms, clothing and toys, and food can be purchased in larger, bulk quantities.

"By . Mail online Reporter . A paraplegic woman is suing General Motors after a car seat heater allegedly scorched her buttocks. Emma Verrill, 26, claims she suffered third-degree burns and needed surgery after sitting in a 2008 Chevrolet Suburban two years ago. Verrill says in her suit that the car manufacturer didn't adequately test the rear . seat heaters to prevent them from reaching 'dangerously high . temperatures that would burn human flesh.' General Motors denies the heater was defective or that it caused the Texas woman's injuries. Scroll down for video . Taking action: Paraplegic Emma Verrill, 26 (pictured) is suing General Motors after a car seat heater allegedly scorched her buttocks in 2012 . Paraplegic: Wheelchair-bound Emma Verrill (pictured right and left) is paralyzed from the waist . down and says she can't feel hot and cold in the lower half of her body . Verrill, who is paralyzed from the waist down, filed the suit in the U.S. District . Court in Portland, Maine, last month. The wheelchair-bound woman told Portland Press Herald she she can feel touch but not temperature in her lower body. She said she didn't know that the seat heater in her friend's vehicle was activated on June 28, 2012, as they drove from New York City to the Connecticut shore. 'I have very limited sensation. I have touch sensation, but I don't have temperature sensation,' she said. 'So if water is too hot or if something is too cold, I can't tell. Because of that, my body can tell me in other ways if there is something that isn't really right.' Verrill, who was paralyzed after botched spinal surgery at age 15, said she noticed a blister the size of her palm on her buttocks the next day. The teaching fellow said a doctor had to remove a section of skin from her upper thigh to graft in place of her burned flesh. She said doctors and her friend said the burn was likely to have been caused by the seat heater. After surgery, Verrill claims she was bedridden for three months and was dependent on her parents in Yarmouth, Maine. General Motors vehicle: Emma Verrill claims she was burned and needed surgery after sitting in a 2008 Chevrolet Suburban like the one pictured . According to Portland Press Herald, General Motors filed a court response denying the heater was defective or that it caused Verrill's injuries. A US magistrate has ordered both sides to be ready for trial by May 4, 2015. Verrill is seeking unspecified damages. The lawsuit comes at a time when General Motors has been harshly criticized for safety defects in other vehicles. This year, the company reportedly had to recall more than 20 million vehicles. A spokeswoman for consumer advocacy group Center for Auto Safety said they had no record of recalls or lawsuits related to seat heaters in the Suburban line.","Emma Verrill can't feel heat or cold below her waist .

Owner of the Delsea Drive-In John DeLeonardis - who . also happens to be a pediatrician -  says that his business has a strict . policy against outside food and drink. Entry refused: Ben Weidner, who suffers from Type 1 diabetes, was refused entry to Delsea Drive-In because he was carrying a juice-box and some candy for his condition . Weidner was refused entry to the Vineland cinema, where his father had taken him and his friends for a fun . night at the movies, because of the food items in his backpack. 'No food. No drink. Bottom line,' Dr DeLeonardis told WPVI. 'Sorry your kid has an affliction but what can I tell you?' Ben's father Phil Weidner says DeLeonardis went too far in enforcing the rule with his son. 'He needs to have items with him to handle low blood sugar. He's got celiac, he's got numerous food allergies. We are bringing these items in not because they are extra items to eat, but because they are for his own safety,' he told WPVI. Doctor's orders: Dr John DeLeonardis is a pediatrician and the owner of Delsea Drive-In and says that he won't change his rule to allow diabetics to bring in outside snacks because he'll lose money at the concession stand .

However, for a person suffering a sudden drop in blood-sugar levels, even a short wait in line at a concession stand could spell disaster. Ben Weidner, who already has to worry about his condition daily and inject himself with insulin, the abortive trip to the movies left a bad taste in his mouth.

"By . Freya Noble . and Emily Crane for Daily Mail Australia . Following the array of hilarious #maccasfail photos which have been splashed across social media showing the fast food chains' mishaps and muck-ups, a new series of failures have come to light. Dubbed #supermarket fail, images snapped by unimpressed customers show one cent discounts, alcohol advertised as a a back to school special - possibly for the parents - and suspiciously named sandwiches. Cupcakes without icing from supermarket giant Coles, and 'Washed & Ready to use' lettuce from Woolworth which looks less than clean have also popped up under the comical hashtag. Scroll down for video . One user found a bottle shop advertising wine as a back to school special with the caption 'Back to school today? Make sure you pack you lunchbox with grapes!' Another was puzzled by the placement of this security stick hastagging the photo #supermarketfail . This savvy customer wasn't fooled by the 'discount' on this bottle of alcohol . Adding to the so-called fails are bananas labelled simply as 'curved yellow fruit' and a security sticker placed in a very unfortunate place on the front of a CD. Confused, frustrated and surprised and amused customers have shared all these photos and more across social media, most simply poking fun at the retailers' mistakes rather than anger. On the McDonald's front slices of cheese served outside the bun, meatless burgers, unusually small ice cream sundaes and poor presentation are among the 'failures' of the fast food chain that have enraged Australian customers. Woolworths' 'Washed & Ready to use' spinach didn't look so clean according to one person . Despite the lack of icing this Coles customer admitted she still at the whole pack of cupcakes . This supermarket seemed to have forgotten the name of a very common fruit .

The so-called fast food dinner dramas have led to some taking to Twitter and Facebook with their dining disasters and posting under the #maccasfail hashtag. Customer photos and amusing comments have inundated social media, drawing attention to various slip ups from McDonalds' stores and staff. One of them is a woman who ordered a soft serve ice cream 'in a cup not a cone'. She allegedly got more than she bargained for when staff simply placed the ice cream and cone inside a sundae cup. Among the complaints on the #maccasfail hashtag is the Facebook user who was outraged by the size of his sundaes . This woman who ordered a soft serve ice cream 'in a cup not a cone'.

'I bet poor girl serving gets sick of explaining that 2 disgruntled carnivores!' he tweeted. A man who had been waiting in line at a McDonalds' store for 10 minutes says the girls standing behind him were outrageously served first. 'How's this for disappointment - half a piece of cheese! Half a piece of cheese! I am outraged McDonalds,' a woman posted alongside this photo of her burger . It took this man one bite before he realised he was missing an essential part of his cheeseburger ... the beef patty .

'Yes they were hot... oh wait now I see why #maccasfail,' he tweeted.

The woman whose massive personal closet supposedly full of luxury goods was robbed earlier this month has admitted some of her personal items are in fact 'costume.' The Houston Press reported that it received goods from the supposed thief that broke into Theresa Roemer's 'she-cave' August 2. That individual used a New York City-based disposable phone - and a voice modulator - to call the weekly August 12, The Houston Press said. 'I contacted Theresa Roemer and explained . to her that her items were fake,' the person reportedly told The Press. 'I . requested over half a million dollars to return her items and not . expose her to the news. During the meet, it seemed as if she contacted . authorities. The deal never went through. I'm following through with my . threat.' In response, Roemer told ABC13 'He claims that whatever it is that's in there is fake. Well, you know, if you walk into any one woman's closet there's gonna be valuable things, and there's gonna be costume things, and there's gonna be vintage things.' Scroll down for videos . Homeowner: Theresa Roemer has revealed that some of the items inside her massive 'she cave' closet are not as expensive as others. The person who reportedly robbed Roemer earlier this month has said the items in her closet are fake . Ransom plot: The bracelet and watch were among some 10-15 valuables stolen earlier this month from the home of Theresa Roemer . Personal memento: The loot included this silver heart-shaped locket with a lock of light-brown hair inside that supposedly belonged to Roemer's deceased son . Shakedown: The burglar allegedly asked Roemer to pay up $500,000 to stop him or her from revealing to the media that her valuables were worthless, but the former Miss Texas refused . 'It's one thing to be robbed but now it's . another for someone to hold me for ransom for my belongings,' she also . told the affiliate station. Roemer also defended herself to ABC13, saying 'If this crook really knew me and did the research on me, he would know I'm as authentic as they come. What you see is what you get.' Houston Press reporter Craig Malisow told The Houston Chronicle that speaking to the mysterious individual 'was kind of odd.' 'It sounded like he felt like he was wronged - because when he went to go fence this stuff, he was allegedly told this was fake ... it kind of felt like he was the victim here,' Masilow told the newspaper. Masilow, speaking about a heart-shaped locket sent to The Houston Press that supposedly held the hair of Roemer's dead son, told ABC13 'I think that hair would be the key to finding out whether or not it's fake.' Montgomery County Sheriff's Office investigators have retrieved the items sent to The Houston Press by the supposed thief - who claimed they were taken from Theresa Roemer's home and were bogus .

On Saturday, Roemer told HoustonCultureMap her closet contained both expensive and inexpensive goods. 'It's like any person's closet. You mix and match,' she told the website. 'In my closet, I have a Donna Karan dress next to one from the Gap. My stylist had some vintage jewelry there from back in the '60s. Not everything is a million-dollar design.' Montgomery County Sheriff's Office investigators have retrieved the items sent to The Houston Press. 'As soon as we got the news [about The .

Happier times: Theresa Roemer's massive 'she-cave' housed a fortune's worth of expensive handbags, watches, shoes and other baubles . Cleaned out: What's likely a professional thief made off with nearly a million dollar's worth of Roemer's possessions . Citing an infrared camera, Roemer told The Houston Chronicle 'That's why it is so unclear and we can't tell the exact color of [the thief's] clothing.' Roemer told the newspaper she and her husband failed to turn on their home's security system the night of the robbery. 'I don't think anybody can go through life without doing something careless when they're flustered and hurried before leaving,' she told The Houston Chronicle. 'But now I lock all my doors and have lights on, inside and out. The alarm is set, and I'm having more lights and cameras installed.' Roemer said that because she was only away from her home a short while she did not arm the security system . Roemer said she and her husband were only away for 90 minutes to eat dinner at a nearby country club . The luxurious 'she cave'  cost . roughly $500,000 to build, The Houston Chronicle reported in July. 'It . started years ago when I had a closet party and all the girls came over . and they said, ""I just wish it was bigger,""' she told the newspaper at the time.

'My daughter always says that she doesn’t need to go to the store; she can just shop my closet!' she once told Neiman Marcus's blog.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell struggled to rein in his wife's erratic behavior, causing turmoil throughout the executive staff and nearly prompting a mass resignation among workers in the governor's mansion, a defense witness testified on Monday. After prosecutors presented nearly three weeks of testimony in the public corruption trial of McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, lawyers for Bob McDonnell opened their defense with even more testimony that portrayed Maureen McDonnell badly, saying she lashed out when she didn't get her way. Prosecutors say the McDonnells accepted more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams in exchange for promoting his company's dietary supplements. The couple is charged in a 14-count indictment. Lawyers for former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell opened their defense with even more testimony that portrayed Maureen McDonnell badly, saying that he struggled to rein her in . The tight relationship between Maureen McDonnell and Williams has been a key issue at trial, with the former governor's lawyers suggesting that she acted largely on her own to promote Williams' tobacco-based supplement, Anatabloc. Janet Kelly, who served as secretary of the commonwealth under McDonnell, said she was personally fond of Maureen McDonnell and was reluctant to bash her any further. 'I don't want to just pile on,' she said, fighting back tears. But Kelly said she had known about Maureen's 'challenging behavior' for years and that she took the job as secretary of the commonwealth only after receiving assurances she wouldn't have to deal with Maureen. She eventually agreed to have contact with her, she testified, when she learned that Maureen McDonnell was yelling at her husband nightly about the sorts of issues that Kelly had been ducking. Kelly and other staffers intervened to thwart a mass resignation of the mansion staff, in which they wrote a joint letter stating that 'to be treated like naughty children any time something doesn't suit you is completely unacceptable.' The ex-governor was accused of struggling to rein in his wife's erratic behavior which caused turmoil throughout the executive staff . Kelly said the letter would be counterproductive because Maureen McDonnell was 'pathologically incapable of accepting any responsibility.' And Kelly said Maureen McDonnell reacted badly when her husband told her at the outset of the administration that she would have to suspend her business selling vitamins and other supplements. On the other hand, Kelly described the former governor as 'extraordinarily gracious' and even-tempered. 'There was never a time he made me feel uncomfortable. Never a time I questioned his motives,' she said. Kelly testified that while the relationship between the McDonnells appeared to be strained, she said she observed Maureen McDonnell and Williams acting 'kind of flirty' on a plane trip in 2012. Defense attorneys have said the marriage was on the rocks and that Maureen had developed a crush on Williams, suggesting that the McDonnells could not have engaged in a criminal conspiracy because they were barely speaking. Kelly, who played a key role in handing out jobs and appointments, testified that she was never asked to give any appointments or jobs to Williams or executives from his company. Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell , right, is swarmed by the media as he arrives at federal court in Richmond, Va., on Monday to present his defense . McDonnell wanted only the 'best and the brightest' to serve in his administration, regardless of their political connections, she said. Bob McDonnell's lawyer, Henry Asbill, sought to dispel the notion that McDonnell's influence could be bought, asking Kelly what the former governor's philosophy was for dealing with donors. 'If you can't take someone's money and vote against their bill the next day, you shouldn't be in politics,' Kelly said. Her testimony painted a different picture than that of another cabinet secretary, Bill Hazel. Testifying for prosecutors, he said that as health secretary he met with Williams only because McDonnell asked him to. Hazel thought little of Williams or his tobacco-derived supplement, Anatabloc, and testified that he and his staffers derisively referred to Williams as the Tic-Tac Man for the samples he doled out. Before testimony began, Judge James R. Spencer told lawyers that a third juror has been excused from the case, this one to tend to a family emergency. That leaves only one alternate. Bob McDonnell is expected to testify in his own defense at some point in the trial. The McDonnells are accused of accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams .","Lawyers for Bob McDonnell opened their defense with even more testimony that portrayed his wife Maureen McDonnell badly .

Both men have since accepted and posted videos of their attempts. Meanwhile, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' ice bucket challenge was published on his company's YouTube page Friday. He was nominated by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Bezos, seen at a company meeting, joked with an audience and said he had to mull over who else to nominate. 'I've been following this ice bucket challenge and I find it totally amazing,' Bezos said. Bezos mentioned he considered nominating NSA leaker Edward Snowden - but that 'If he takes the ice bucket challenge, it'll just leak,' he said to laughter from the audience. All for a good cause: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos took the ice bucket challenge at a company meeting . Who to pick? Bezos said he had trouble thinking of who to nominate for the challenge, but settled on former Star Trek actors William Shatner, Patrick Stewart and George Takei .

"By . Reuters . and Zoe Szathmary for MailOnline . Community Health Systems Inc., one of the biggest U.S. hospital groups, said on Monday it was the victim of a cyber attack from China, resulting in the theft of Social Security numbers and other personal data belonging to 4.5million patients. That would make the attack the largest of its type involving patient information since a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website started tracking such breaches in 2009. The previous record, an attack on a Montana Department of Public Health server, was disclosed in June and affected about 1 million people. The attackers appear to be from a sophisticated hacking group in China that has breached other major U.S. companies across several industries, said Charles Carmakal, managing director with FireEye Inc's (FEYE.O) Mandiant forensics unit, which led the investigation of the attack on Community Health in April and June. Theft: States that are blue on this map contain hospitals run by Community Health Systems. 4.5million patients' personal information was reportedly stolen by a Chinese cyberattack . Investigator:  Charles Carmakal, pictured, said the attackers appear to be from a sophisticated hacking group in China that has breached other major U.S. companies across several industries . 'They have fairly advanced techniques for breaking into organizations as well as maintaining access for fairly long periods of times without getting detected,' he told Reuters. Carmakal and officials with Community Health Systems declined to name the group or say if it was linked to the Chinese government, which U.S. businesses and officials have long accused of orchestrating cyber espionage campaigns around the globe. Community Health Systems revealed the cyber attack in a SEC filing on Monday. 'The Company and its forensic expert, Mandiant (a FireEye Company), believe the attacker was an “Advanced Persistent Threat” group originating from China who used highly sophisticated malware and technology to attack the Company’s systems,' Community Health Systems said. 'The attacker was able to bypass the Company’s security measures and successfully copy and transfer certain data outside the Company.' In May, a U.S. grand jury indicted five Chinese military officers on charges they hacked into U.S. companies for sensitive manufacturing secrets, the toughest action to date taken by Washington to address cyber spying. China has denied the charges. FBI spokesman Joshua Campbell told Reuters his agency was investigating the case, but declined to elaborate. The Department of Homeland Security said it believed the incident was isolated to Community Health Systems, although it shared technical details about the attack with other healthcare providers. An agency official told Reuters it was too soon to confirm who was behind the attack. 'While attribution of this incident is still being determined by a range of partners, we caution against leaping to premature conclusions about who or how many actors are behind these activities,' said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. The stolen information included patient names, addresses, birth dates, telephone numbers and social security numbers of people who were referred or received services from doctors affiliated with the hospital group in the last five years, the company said in the regulatory filing. It did not include medical or clinical information. At risk: The stolen information included patient names, addresses, birth dates, telephone numbers and Social Security numbers of people who were referred or received services from doctors affiliated with Community Health Systems in the last five years . Cybersecurity has come under increased scrutiny at healthcare providers this year, both by law enforcement and attackers. The FBI warned the industry in April that its protections were lax compared with other sectors, making it vulnerable to hackers looking for details that could be used to access bank accounts or obtain prescriptions. Over the past six months Mandiant has seen a spike in cyber attacks on healthcare providers, although this was the first case it had seen in which a sophisticated Chinese group has stolen personal data, according to Carmakal. Chinese hacking groups are known for seeking out intellectual property such as product design or information that might be of use in business or political negotiations. Social Security numbers and other personal data are typically stolen by cybercriminals to sell on underground exchanges for use by others in identity theft. 'It’s hard to tell why these guys took the data or what they plan to do with it,' Carmakal told Reuters. His firm monitors about 20 hacking groups in China. Dmitri Alperovitch, chief technology officer with cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, told Reuters Chinese hackers sometimes attack healthcare providers to obtain medical records of government officials and even potential intelligence assets. 'Maybe they were trying to get at the medical data, but for some reason they couldn’t, so they exfiltrated everything else, figuring that it might somehow be helpful,' Alperovitch said. The company said the stolen data did not include credit card numbers, or any intellectual property such as data on medical device development. Community Health, which has 206 hospitals in 29 states, said it has removed malicious software used by the attackers from its systems and completed other remediation steps. It is now notifying patients and regulatory agencies, as required by law. It also said it is insured against such losses and does not at this time expect a material adverse effect on financial results. As of this writing, Community Health's stock is at $51.66 on the New York Stock Exchange.","Community Health Systems Inc. said it was the victim of a cyber attack from .

"By . Lillian Radulova For Daily Mail Australia . and Australian Associated Press . A 19-year-old male cadet at the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) has been granted bail on two counts of sexually assaulting his female colleagues. Harlan Agresti was arrested on Tuesday after the two women, both of whom are also aged 19, reported sperate incidents to ADFA staff the previous day. Mr Agresti will plead not guilty to two counts of sexual intercourse without consent when he reapears at the ACT Magistrates Court on October 30. Scroll down for video . Harlan Agresti, a cadet from the Australian Defence Force Academy, was granted bail on Wednesday after being charged with sexually assaulting two female cadets . The 19-year-old covered his face as he left the ACT Magistrates Court: He was arrested on Tuesday by ACT police after the two women made their allegations regarding separate incidents to ADFA staff the previous day . One of the alleged offences occurred in June 2013 after a night in Civic, and the other in February this year at one of the women's Campbell homes. The allegations were referred to the Australian Defence Force Investigative Service, which then referred them on to ACT Policing. 'Defence is providing all appropriate support to the individuals concerned,' it said in a statement on Wednesday. Mr Agresti's bail was set at $10,000 and the conditions require him to reside in Newcastle and prohibit him from contacting the two women who have made allegations against him or any other ADFA cadets. He was also required to give up his passport and comply with a set curfew, restricting him from leaving his home at night. Mr Agresti will plead not guilty to two counts of sexual intercourse without consent when he reapears before the court . The charges come only a week after a Senate Inuiry heard that more than two dozen ADFA officers, who continue to rise through the ranks undisciplined, are alleged to have abused fellow female officer cadets in the 1990s. The charges come only a week after Gary Rumble revealed details of his review into abuse allegations in the Australian Defence Force to a Senate Inquiry and insisted on a royal commission . As a result, the leader of the review into abuse allegations in the Australian Defence Force, Gary Rumble, has insisted that a royal commission take place. Dr Rumble said there was a history of sexual assault and defence mismanagement from the time Australian Defence Force Academy opened in Canberra in 1986, peaking in the 1990s and diminishing but not disappearing entirely following reforms in 1998. There was a very high risk officers in middle and senior management positions with potential to rise further, who were cadets at ADFA, raped or committed other serious sexual assaults on other cadets or did not intervene while such rape or other assaults were occuring, he told a hearing of the inquiry in Canberra last Wednesday. Dr Rumble said it was likely there were many more perpetrators than those recorded in the so-called ADFA 24. That case relates to 15 cases of rape and nine of sexual assault allegedly committed by maleADFA cadets against female cadets between 1994 and 1998. They were never properly investigated at the time. However, both Defence Minister David Johnston and Len Roberts-Smith, who heads the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, are yet to be convinced that a royal inquiry is necessary.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . and Associated Press . There's a hitchhiker making its way across Canada who doesn't have a driver's license--because it's a robot. HitchBOT, created by a team of communication researchers from Ontario, has already been hitchhiking since July and will visit Halifax, Nova Scotia to Victoria, British Columbia and so far has managed to safely travel 3,700 miles. 'Robots cannot get driver’s licenses yet,' explains the two-foot tall robot that looks like a modern day R2D2. Scroll down for video . Ready to ride: HitchBOT the talking robot that's been hitchhiking rides from strangers to travel from Canada's east to west coast is nearing the end of its journey . Family: HitchBOT at home with its research team in Port Credit, Ontario, Canada before its epic journey . The goal of the project, as explained by one of the robot's inventors David Smith, is to see how comfortable humans are when traveling with robots. It's also a way of seeing how a robot will react to an unpredictable situation. 'What we wanted to do is situate robotics and artificial technologies into unlikely scenarios and push the limits of what it's capable of, ‘he told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 'It's challenging but it can also be highly engaging and entertaining as hitchBOT has proven.' The Daily Dot reports that the bot is equipped with a car seat attached to its torso so it can be easily strapped to cars and a GPS system so that researchers can track its travels. Not only can hitchBOT sit safely in the passenger's seat, it has speech recognition software and can answer simple questions. Enjoying the ride: HitchBOT depoends on the kindness an curiosity and kindness of strangers to take him on his way through Canada . Can I have a lift?: HitchBOT is traveling from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Victoria, British Columbia . Ferry interesting: Somehow hitchBOT managed to make it's way onto a boat . When hitchBOT is running low on battery it can ask the driver to plug it in to an outlet or cigarette lighter. HitchBOT has taken to social media to report its travels and yesterday wrote, 'This week I'll be meeting with B.C. First Nations, taking a quick jaunt to Seattle, then arriving at my final destination, Open Space artist center in Victoria on Thursday the 21st.' HitchBOT has attracted over 43,000 Facebook likes and has driven with families, Canadian rock bands and has even traveled by boat. The Daily Dot reports that the robot will arrive at its final destination later this week where of course it will be welcomed by a traditional Aboriginal canoe ceremony. Along the way, hitchBOT was invited to a pow-wow with the Wikwemikong First Nation group, where the robot was dubbed Biiaabkookwe, according to its Twitter feed. It later hitched a ride with Belgian tourists. Making friends: hitchBOT is making new friends everywhere it goes . Ready for adventure: hitchBOT began its trip in Halifax, Nova Scotia back in July . HitchBOT hung out with the British Columbia rock band The Wild, which is taking it to its next performance. Smith said his team monitors hitchBOT via GPS and social media but drivers have been in control of where they take it and leave it. Smith said the team had replacement robots to continue the journey in case anything happened to hitchBOT, but so far, the robot has not been mistreated. The child-sized robot is able to able to stand, making it visible to drivers via a retractable tripod. It has a car seat attached to its torso so drivers can strap it into their cars using seatbelts. Matthew Berry, of Alberta, said some friends picked up the robot while heading to a wedding in Golden, B.C. They picked it up on the border between Alberta and Calgary, where its previous driver was looking to offload it. 'It was good fun; we took it out onto the dance floor to, well, do the real robot,"" Berry said. ""It was funny because it was a very meticulously planned wedding so I wasn't sure how the bride would react, but she loved it!' Berry said while the couple was giving their speech, the bride thanked the couple's friends for attending, and the robot interrupted, saying, 'I like to make friends.'","HitchBOT, created by a team of communication researchers from Ontario, has already traveled 3,700 miles since July .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A routine stowaway who was recently ordered to spend 117 days in jail for violating probation by returning to Los Angeles International Airport when she was ordered not to has been released due to overcrowding. Marilyn Jean Hartman, 62, was spotted wandering LAX without a ticket on August 7 - just one day after a judge placed her on probation for two years for sneaking aboard the Southwest Airlines flight from San Jose to Los Angeles. On Wednesday a court commissioner ordered her to serve 117 days - scolding her for again wasting law enforcement resources - however she was released from Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood, California, shortly after 6 p.m. She was released because of jail overcrowding and a state program that credits nonviolent misdemeanor offenders such as Hartman for good behavior, time served and other circumstances, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Crystal Hernandez said. Released: Marilyn Jean Hartman served just three days of a 117-day jail sentence - after violating her probation for repeatedly sneaking onto flights - due to overcrowding . Hartman, who has made previous attempts . to sneak aboard flights at other airports, was arrested August 4 for . taking a Southwest Airlines flight from San Jose to Los Angeles without a . ticket. Safe place: Marilyn Jean Hartman has a history of mental illness and has said that she feels safer in airports than on the streets . At Mineta San Jose International Airport, Hartman tried at least three times to get to a plane before she finally went past a security screener who was busy checking a family's documents, law enforcement officials said. She later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway on an aircraft and was sentenced to two years of probation. Her boarding status was discovered once the Southwest flight landed in Los Angeles, the officials said. Hartman later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway on an aircraft. A judge ordered her to stay away from LAX unless she had a valid ticket. Outside . the courthouse after sentencing, Hartman said she would never try to sneak . onto a plane again. 'It was stupid, and it is something I don't want to . repeat,' she said. However, . Los Angeles Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said he had a feeling . the woman 'with a fixation on flying would return to LAX, so police . passed out fliers with her picture. 'She was seen wandering through several terminals today in what appeared to be a scouting mission,' he said. Repeated attempts:  Hartman was sentenced to 18 months probation for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound flights earlier in the year. She spent three days in jail . In . February, Hartman was sentenced to 18 months' probation in San Mateo . County after being arrested for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound . flights at San Francisco International Airport on three separate days. Her . breach of security at the San Jose airport caused federal officials and . the airline to launch investigations. It also prompted criticism of the . airport in light of the trespassing of a teenage boy who stowed away in . the wheel well of a Hawaiian Airlines flight and survived an arduous . journey to Maui. Hartman, who authorities say has a . history of mental illness, has now been arrested eight times for . trespassing at airports this year - though this is the first time she's . been caught after successfully boarding a flight. She . said last week that homelessness drove her to take 'desperate . measures,' and that she feels safer being in airports than in the . streets. San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said that Hartman has no family and has never married. According . to a her blog, found by the San Francisco Chronicle, she has lived in . sketchy motels and squalid apartments from Seattle to San Diego in the . last few years. Records . indicate Hartman was arrested November 6, 2010, at the Lihue Airport in . Kauai after trespassing into the baggage claim area, the Chronicle . reported. She was charged with simple trespass, but failed to show up . for court hearings - and remains the subject of a bench warrant.

According . to the newspaper, Hartman said in her blog that she had successfully . hopped a plane once before. She was found out and detained - but later . released without charge. In May - after being arrested seven times at San Francisco International Airport - Hartman was placed in a mental treatment program but she stopped attending last month. 'She declined all of our efforts to offer her assistance,' Wagstaffe said. 'And we tried all of the alternatives we had because we weren't interested in locking her up on our end.' Then she went back to the San Francisco airport, but Wagstaffe's office declined to file charges after her seventh arrest in July for another failed attempt. On Monday, Hartman was only caught after the plane landed at Los Angeles International Airport and the crew counted the passengers who remained on board for the final destination to Phoenix. She was hauled off the plane and charged with trespassing by the Los Angeles Police Department.","Marilyn Jean Hartman, 62, was sentenced to 177 days in prison for violating her probation on Wednesday .

"By . Australian Associated Press . A woman whose genitals were mutilated by rogue doctor Graeme Reeves says he has been let 'off the hook', with a NSW court ruling he will not serve more time. The gynaecologist was behind bars for just 18 months for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Carolyn DeWaegeneire with intent in 2002. The former doctor, who worked in Bega on the state's south coast, surgically removed her clitoris and labia without consent during an operation on a pre-cancerous lesion. Initially he was sentenced in the District Court to a minimum of two years for this and other offences, including aggravated indecent assault. Scroll down for video . Dr Graeme Reeves was released from jail in December after serving just 18 months . Victim Carolyn DeWaegeneire speaks to the media outside the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal today . But in February last year the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal (CCA) found the sentence was 'manifestly inadequate' and jailed him for a further 18 months. Reeves then appealed to the High Court and was released on parole on December 20. In a further blow to Ms DeWaegeneire, the appeals court on Monday said although Reeves' original sentence was 'manifestly inadequate', his ill health meant it was not appropriate to intervene further with his sentence. Reeves has chronic kidney disease and is on dialysis, the court heard. In the months after he was released by the High Court, psychiatrist Dr Olav Nielssen found the former doctor had also experienced a relapse into a chronic depressive illness. This was due to his 'disappointment at the lack of support from his family after his release, the progression of his kidney disease, the current circumstances of his detention and his anxiety about his future,' Dr Nielssen found. Taking this into account, the CCA resentenced him to a minimum of three and a half years. Reeves will remain on parole until his full sentence of five and a half years expires in May 2016. Ms DeWaegeneire told reporters that when the CCA initially increased his sentence she thought 'maybe somebody is thinking about what he actually did'. 'Now I'm absolutely back to where I was before ... He's free, he's off the hook.' 'Now I'm absolutely back to where I was before ... He's free, he's off the hook' In February last year it emerged that police had sifted through more than 100 complaints against Reeves. However, months later, then NSW attorney-general Greg Smith said the allegations were not pursued because of 'insufficient evidence'. Since he was jailed Reeves, who was struck off in 2004, has completed a Masters degree in medicine and human genetics. Graeme Stephen Reeves first appointed as a visiting medical officer at Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital in 1985, according to NSW Health Department documents . About 35 complaints were made over 20 different incidents about Mr Reeves’s behaviour and clinical practice, starting on June 1986 . Mr Reeves was banned from obstetrics in July 1997 . Psychiatric reports, dating from 1996 to 2004, diagnosed him with a personality disorder and also said he prominent narcissistic features and was at times severely depressed . Reeves continued to practice obstetrics  in hospitals around NSW's south coast region hospitals from April 2002 to January 2003  and gynaecology until the termination of his contract in July 2003 . There were complaints made at the end of 2002 about difficult working relationships between Reeves and staff at Pambula Hospital and by November 14, the hospital did not provide obstetric services . Then in 2003 similar complaints were received about Bega Hospital staff and Reeves, as well as obstetric services he provided to a patient at the hospital in January . He was found guilty by the District Court jury in 2011 for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on patient Carolyn DeWaegeneire after he mutilated her clitoris and labia without her consent during an operation to take out a pre-cancerous lesion in 2002. He was released from jail last December after serving just 18-months of his three-and-a-half year sentence.","Carolyn DeWaegeneire says 'Butcher' has been let off the hook .

Police will allege the man carried a knife during his attacks and would approach the victim from behind, overpower them and take them to an isolated location where he then sexually assaulted them. Detective Superintendent Linda Howlett described the crimes as random and terrifying. 'They were horrific crimes, the victims were very young in age when they were sexually assaulted,' she said. She said she hoped that the arrest would bring some relief and closure to the victims and urged other victims of sexual assault to come forward to police.

A revealing new book will lift the lid on the secrets behind America’s most beloved comedy show –SNL- and the battles that raged between politicians over its most famous political satire sketches. The book: 'Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live by James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales will include 200 extra pages of material which did not appear in the original 2002 book. According to excerpts from The Hollywood Reporter, Hillary Clinton's 'entitled attitude' could have indirectly helped then Senator Barack Obama to win the Democratic nomination to run in 2008. Appearance: In 2007, then senator Barack Obama, right, appeared on SNL with Darrell Hammond, left, as Bill Clinton, Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton during the 'Clinton Halloween Party' skit . SNL: Barack Obama stands in front of  Hillary Rodham Clinton who cancelled her appearance on SNL in 2007 which led to Obama appearing on it instead . According to the book, Clinton’s campaign lobbied for her to guest host SNL for the show’s season opener in 2007, when the former first lady was still favored to win the 2008 Democratic nomination. But on the week of production, her campaign cancelled, leaving a spot open. This, it’s . thought, led a little known Senator called Barack Obama to take her . place —possibly influencing the outcome of the 2008 presidential campaign. Executive Producer Lorne Michaels recalls: ‘We put Obama on the date when Hillary was supposed to be on.’ ‘The sense of entitlement which was following her everywhere at that point peaked for me at the bailing,’ he added. Entitled: SNL executive Producer Lorne Michaels recalls: 'We put Obama on the date when Hillary was supposed to be on.' Another excerpt reveals that Sarah Palin felt like she had been portrayed ‘as an idiot,’ by the gifted SNL comedian Tina Fey. This made her want to come on the show and change people's perception. Palin said: ‘I know that they portrayed me as an idiot and I hated that and I wanted to come on the show and counter some of that.’ This, it appears was the incentive behind her awkward 2008 appearance alongside cast member Tina Fey. Fey, captured national attention when she imitated Palin’s trademark beehive, red suit and distinctive accent and made the phrase: ‘I can see Russia from my house,’ world famous. Before her appearance, family members had told Fey that she was the spitting image of the Vice Presidential nominee. But she wasn’t convinced.

But some cousins and old classmates were all saying, ‘That lady looks like you.’' ‘I was sort of — arrogantly, in my own mind — resisting it, like, ‘I don't want to play that, and I don't know who's gonna write it, and what if I don't like what they wrote, people are going to think that I wrote it.’ But after she executed the character perfectly and Palin agreed to appear, Michaels said Fey was 'terrified of anything where they would be together looking like an endorsement.' Michaels even called on celebrity friends to come and see the segment. He said:' I called Alec [Baldwin] to come in for [Palin's appearance on Oct. 18, 2008], to be standing with me, because he was the most emblematic liberal at that point. Dream team: Tina Fey, left and SNL executive producer Lorne Michaels recalls how he called Alec Baldwin to come in for Palin's appearance in 2008 . 'He said he had to introduce a documentary at the Hamptons Film Festival on that Saturday, so he wouldn't be able to do it. 'So I said, 'Alec, your instincts are always great, but are you telling me you're not going to be here for this thing that the whole world is waiting to see?' Yet, viewers tuned in in their droves to that particular segment which helped SNL draw its largest audience in 14 years with 14 million viewers. Palin added: 'If I ran into Tina Fey again today, I would say: 'You need to at least pay for my kids' braces or something from all the money that you made off of pretending that you're me! 'My goodness, you capitalized on that! Can't you contribute a little bit? Jeez!' In another . excerpt, writer Michaels appealed to Obama to talk with NBC network . chiefs who had expressed concern over a sketch which could be offensive to Arabs. This was when Obama was doing a cameo on the show. But he turned them down saying ‘It’s funny, but no, I don’t think so.' However, Obama’s influence on the show was widespread. James Downey, a writer-producer who retired in 2013 said: ‘The last couple seasons of the show were the only two in the show’s history where we were totally like every other comedy show: basically, an arm of the Hollywood Democratic establishment. ‘Jon Stewart was more nuanced. We just stopped doing anything which could even be misinterpreted as a criticism of Obama.’ Meanwhile, Jay Pharoah, castmember recalls how he did an event at Harvey Weinstein's house. He said: ‘I was trying to take my makeup off because I was Obama at this event, and [Obama] stood right there watching me do it. ‘He was laughing; it was so petrifying. As long as there's no beef between me and the president, that's good. When that happens, you're Kanye West.’ In more . sombre times, like right after 9/11, cast and crew recall how they were . forced to give politics a rest because of the sensitivity surrounding . events. However, important political figures, presidential hopefuls and others have made it an important stop ever since President Ford’s first appearance in 1976.","The book entitled: 'Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live' contains juicy behind-the-scenes details of politicians on SNL .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Texas Governor Rick Perry will not have a warrant issued for his arrest but could be forced to pose for a mugshot. The Republican's fate was decided on Monday when a judge issued a summons after a grand jury indicted him for felony charges. But the governor still faces the unflattering prospect of being booked, fingerprinted and having his mugshot taken at some point. Scroll down for video . Presidential hopeful: Gov. Perry's aides said the case won't derail his busy travel schedule as he continues to eye a second run for the White House in 2016 . According to sources, the governor has . assembled a team of high-powered attorneys to fight the two felony . counts of abuse of power against him. However, leading . conservatives around the country have come out in support of the . longest-serving governor in Texas history. 'This . is nothing more than banana republic politics,' Tony Buzbee a . Houston-based defense attorney who will head a cadre of four lawyers . from Texas and Washington defending Perry, said. 'The charges lobbed against the governor are a really nasty attack not . only on the rule of law but on the Constitution of the United States, . the state of Texas and also the fundamental constitutional protections . that we all enjoy.' Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris . Christie, a potential rival for the 2016 race released a statement . Monday saying he has 'complete faith and confidence in Governor Perry's . honesty and integrity.' This . was echoed by Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and . U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas who may all may seek the GOP White House . nomination. Support: Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris . Christie, left, released a statement saying he has complete faith and . confidence in Gov. Perry's honesty and integrity and Jeb Bush appeared . to agree with his sentiments . Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said the charges 'could well help' Perry. Gov. Branstad, a Republican said: 'It . is an attack. It also is coming out of a county where you wouldn't . expect even-handedness.' On Monday, Republican Judge Bert Richardson . decided against issuing an arrest warrant and instead a special . prosecutor appointed to the matter was planning a simple legal summons. But that still means a booking is in Gov. Perry's future although it's not known exactly when this will take place. Mr . Buzbee said: 'That's going to be something, that when he goes in to be . booked and take his picture that we're going to let you know about.' Gov. Perry's arraignment — a court appearance to answer the charges — could be held on Aug. 29 at 9 a.m. A . spokesman for Gov. Perry said that date had not been confirmed, adding . that the governor wouldn't need to appear personally at the arraignment. He will, however, have to appear at his booking. A . grand jury in Austin, a liberal bastion in otherwise largely . conservative Texas, indicted Gov. Perry for carrying out a threat to . veto $7.5 million in funding for the state's public integrity unit. Travis . County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, refused to . resign following a drunken driving arrest. The ethics unit is housed . under Ms Lehmberg's office. Fightback: Gov. Rick Perry makes a statement in Austin, Texas on August 16, 2014 over the charges he faces . No . one disputes that Perry has the power to veto measures approved by the . Legislature, but his threat to do so before actually carrying it out . prompted a complaint from a left-leaning watchdog. The . grand jury met for months before handing down its indictment, and Gov. Perry's $450 per-hour defense attorney was paid using state funds. Mr . Buzbee said the public will continue footing the bill for the . governor's now pricier legal team, though he said a private foundation . could eventually be established to handle some of the costs. After . Gov. Perry avoided an arrest warrant questions were raised of . favoritism, but legal observers said forgoing an arrest warrant is . common in white-collar cases. On Friday, Gov. Perry became the first Texas governor since 1917 to be indicted and is facing charges of coercion and official oppression that carry a maximum sentence of 109 years in prison. He is also facing allegations of carrying out a threat to veto funding for the state's public integrity unit last summer. But the governor has emphatically stood by his veto and denied all wrongdoing. But Gov. Perry's aides said the . case won't derail his busy travel schedule. He is still on schedule to visit several key presidential battleground states as he continues to eye a . second run for the White House in 2016. He will visit Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina in the next two weeks. He is also due to give a speech on Thursday on immigration at the Heritage Foundation in Washington. The speech is an attempt to re-brand himself to a national audience after stumbling . badly during his short-lived 2012 presidential campaign. Former U.S. Attorney Matt Orwig said that insisting on an arrest warrant for Perry would have been 'grandstanding.' 'He's obviously not a flight risk or danger to the community,' Mr Orwig said. Blackwell Thurman Criminal Justice Center: A judge decided not to issue an arrest warrant for Gov. Rick Perry . Conservatives have also have been quick to note that a video recording made at the jail showed Ms Lehmberg shouting at staffers, kicking the door of her cell and sticking her tongue out at deputies. Gov. Perry's attorneys showed the 'outrageous' video again while addressing reporters Monday. Yet, Gov. Perry has not been backed by everyone. Republican Gov. Tom Corbett's re-election campaign removed a video endorsement by the Texas governor from its website following Gov. Perry's indictment.","The governor has assembled a team of lawyers to fight the charges .

"By . Ashley Collman . American Ebola patient Nancy Writebol, 59, is getting better after receiving an experimental medicine, according to her son who appeared on the Today show on Tuesday. Jeremy Writebol has been able to see his mother twice a day through a window in a special ward of Emory University Hospital and says he has noticed a remarkable change since she first returned from Liberia last week. While he initially feared his mother might die after seeing her wheeled into the hospital on a gurney, Jeremy says doctors are now 'very optimistic' she will recover. 'She's been doing well,' Jeremy said. 'We've just seen her get physically better. Her eyes brighten up, her countenance goes up. [She's] smiling, even joking a little bit.' Scroll down for video . Very optimistic: Jeremy Writebol says his mother Nancy is making a remarkable recovery as she is treated for Ebola at Emory University Hospital . Infected: Nancy Writebol (pictured) contracted Ebola while working as a Christian missionary in Liberia. She was flown out of the country last week and is being treated at Emory alongside an infected American doctor . Writebol is being treated at the hospital alongside Dr Kent Brantly, an American physician who also came down with Ebola in Liberia during the largest outbreak of the disease in history. Ebola has killed nearly 1,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria in total. The two Americans were the first to receive an experimental medicine called ZMapp, which doctors hope will help them fight the virus with a 90 per cent fatality rate. Unable to walk: Nancy Writebol is pictured being wheeled into Emory University Hospital after being flown out of Liberia last week . Will it work? Writebol and Dr Kent Brantly (pictured) were the first to receive an experimental medication called ZMapp . Another missionary named Miguel Pajares, 75, was approved to take the medicine, but it is unclear if he was given a dose before his death after being flown back to his home country of Spain. It was announced Monday that doctors in Liberia will soon be receiving the experimental medication as well. While Dr Brantly was able to walk into the hospital, Writebol was in worse condition when she arrived last week but she was still able to recognize her son when she saw him for the first time. 'There was a little crease of a smile that came up and we were both in tears,' Jeremy recalled. 'I was able just to say, ""Mom I love you"". Quarantined: Nancy Writebol's husband David returned from Liberia Monday night and will have to spend approximately three weeks in quarantine before he can visit his wife . 'It was very, very emotional just to see your mom there, in that way, for the first time, after thinking you might never see her again.' Jeremy has also been able to see Dr Brantly at Emory, and he took the chance to thank him for giving his mother care while she was still in Liberia. The two exchanged thumbs up through a window at the ward. 'My mom has said this: ""Jeremy you have a third brother now and it's Dr Brantly,""' Jeremy recalled.

"By . Chris Brooke for the Daily Mail . James Grant was jailed for 18 months for perverting the course of justice after the letter he arranged to be written, which claimed that the alleged victim had made up the attack, caused the trial to be abandoned . An alleged rapist is being freed after derailing his trial by faking letters from his accuser declaring her ‘love’ for him. James Grant, 27, handed the two documents to his lawyers – forcing the judge to abort the case for legal reasons. The woman who said he raped her had already endured the trauma of giving evidence in court. She could not face doing so again in a retrial, so withdrew her complaint. This meant it was not possible to retry him on the rape charge. The letters had been sent to another inmate, passed on to Grant and handed to his legal team who treated them as new evidence. He claimed they were written by one of his victim’s friends on her behalf but she denied this. A writing expert confirmed she did not write them. Gerry Wareham, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said the letters were ‘fabrications’ and Grant’s actions were ‘devious and utterly callous’. He said the CPS ‘offered all possible support’ to address the woman’s concerns about a retrial. Lawyers also considered reading out her original evidence but this was ruled out ‘due to the circumstances of the case’, said Mr Wareham. He added: ‘In the end, the case could not proceed without her testimony and we respect her wish not to give evidence a second time.’ Grant was prosecuted over the faked letters and other attempts to persuade the woman not to testify. He admitted three counts of perverting the course of justice and was jailed for 18 months at Hull Crown Court on Wednesday. But he was due to be released immediately because of time spent on remand. If convicted of rape, Grant, of Roos, near Withernsea, East Yorkshire, would almost certainly have been behind bars for years. The average jail term for rapists is eight years. He was charged with raping the woman in August last year, after meeting her through social media, and remanded in custody. In January, he went on trial and denied rape. Prosecutor David Bradshaw told this week’s case how the letters ‘caused the rape trial to be stopped’. He continued: ‘Our understanding is the letters were written on Mr Grant’s say so, but he claimed they were written by the alleged victim.’ While inside Hull Prison, pictured, James Grant also persuaded a fellow inmate to send the alleged victim a letter offering her money to drop the case . Grant had . made other attempts to force the woman to drop the case. Mr Bradshaw . said: ‘He got another inmate to send a letter to the alleged victim’s . grandma’s address. ‘While not threatening, it was full of innuendo and promises of money.’ Grant . also contacted an ex-girlfriend telling her to ‘sort it’ although she . does not appear to have taken any action, said Mr Bradshaw. Another inmate, Darby Owen, 19, sent the woman a text message dictated by Grant. Owen, . of Hedon, Hull, admitted twice perverting the course of justice and was . given four months in jail, He was due to be released yesterday because . of time spent on remand. Judge . Mark Bury told Grant that faking the letters was ‘a particularly . serious offence’. Passing sentence, he added: ‘The letters you wrote to . the alleged victim were not abusive or threatening but they did amount . to emotional blackmail. ‘There was a persistent series of attempts to persuade the woman not to give evidence.’ Grant was also given a restraining order to keep him away from his accuser. Humberside Police refused to comment on the case.","James Grant, 27, accused of rape, is freed after derailing his trial with letters .

"By . Joel Christie . and Associated  Press Reporter . An archaeology museum in Philadelphia has made an extraordinary find — in its own storage rooms. The Penn Museum, part of the University of Pennsylvania, announced Tuesday that it had 'rediscovered' a 6,500-year-old human skeleton believed to have been a well-muscled man of at least 50, who stood 5 feet, 9 inches tall. The remains were originally excavated from southern Iraq around 1930. Museum officials said the complete human skeleton had been stored in a coffin-like box in one of their rooms for the last 85 years. What do we have here?: Scientists at the Penn Museum say they have uncovered a 6,500-year-old skeleton of a 50-ish man in a coffin-like box in a basement storage room for the last 85 years - with no catalog card or identifying information . Boo: The remains of this man, dating back to about 4400 BC and found in what is now southern Iraq in 1930, have been 'rediscovered' Ancient: The skeleton has been nicknamed 'Noah' because records show the man survived an epic flood . Up-close: The remains were originally excavated from southern Iraq around 1930 . Examining: Janet Monge, the curator-in-charge of the anthropology section at The Penn Museum, discusses recently rediscovered 6,500-year-old human remains . Mint condition: The skeleton originally was discovered in 1929-30 by Sir Leonard Woolley's joint excavation team from the Penn Museum and the British Museum in London . All traces of its original identifying documentations have been lost, but the museum were not worried. A records digitization project was recently undertaken, with University of Pennsylvania researchers, working with a team from the British Museum, determining the remains were first unearthed at the site of Ur, an ancient city near modern-day Nasiriyah, around 1929-1930. The major archaeological project was lead by Sir Leonard Woolley. They excavated nearly 50 feet to reach a site that became known as 'The Royal Cemetery'. During the excavation, the team hit a layer of silt, which Woolley referred to as the 'flood layer', because it was ten-feet deep in some places but still technically up sea level. He determined that the original site of Ur had been a small island in a surrounding marsh. Then a great flood covered the land in the Ubaid-era. Some 48 graves were dug up. The discovery: Historical photos show how the skeleton was originally discovered during a 50-feet dig in southern Iraq . Transport: Workers carry the incredible find out of the digging site in 1929/1930 . Leader: British archaeologist Charles Leonard Woolley (1880-1960) during his excavations at Ur in 1922-34 . However the only skeleton in good enough condition to recover was the one now found at the Penn Museum. The bones and surrounding soil was coated in wax and the entire skeleton was shipped to London, then on to Philadelphia. Skeletons of the same time period, particularly complete remains, are extremely rare, the Penn researchers said. They hope a modern skeletal analysis will reveal more about the population's diet, stresses and ancestral origins that were unable in Woolley's time. Dr. Janet Monge, the curator-in-charge of the anthropology section of the Penn Museum, had known the box was in storage for as long as she had been in charge, but it remained a mystery. Deep down: An historic map shows how far underground the diggers went at the 'Royal Cemetery' There was no catalog card or identifying number. Researchers weren't able to determine its significance until the recent digitization of records. The effort enabled the researchers to link the skeleton to the field records of Woolley. Because the skeleton had survived an epic flood leading Penn researches have appropriately nicknamed their re-discovery 'Noah'. The Penn Museum collection houses more than 150,000 bone specimens from throughout human history. However a museum spokesman told The MailOnline there are no current plans to exhibit 'Noah'.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Eunice Williams was sent home wearing only a nightie and a thin dressing gown in sub-zero termperatures . An 86-year pneumonia patient was sent home from hospital in sub-zero temperatures wearing just her nightdress and a thin dressing gown. The family of Eunice Williams were furious to discover the state she was in, especially as they had supplied plenty of warm clothing. They have now received an unreserved apology from Wrexham Maelor Hospital after they complained. Mrs Williams, who lives near Llangollen, north east Wales, had been admitted with pneumonia a week earlier and her family was terrified the journey in the cold could make her worse. Yesterday they said she was deteriorating. Her nephew Paul Douglas, 32, said: 'I made sure she had plenty of winter clothes to wear because it had been so cold but these were ignored and she was sent home in night clothes with the warm things in a bag.She was close to getting hyperthermia. 'It's disgraceful an 86-year-old woman who has just been treated for pneumonia should be treated in this way. She could have died.' The family were told Mrs Williams would be discharged and taken home by ambulance so Mr Douglas, of Wrexham, and his mother, Mary, went to prepare the house and greet her. But they could not believe the state she was in when she arrived. Wrexham Maelor Hospital has since apologised for the incident . They did, however, commend the treatment Mrs Williams received while in hospital. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board has since apologised unreservedly for the error. A spokesman said: 'We can confirm the family have contacted the hospital to express their concerns about this incident. 'It has been investigated and we have spoken to both Mrs Williams and the family to express our sincere apologies that we did not ensure Mrs Williams was changed into appropriate clothing before her journey home. 'We have already spoken to the relevant nursing staff and reminded them of the importance of making sure patients are correctly dressed, taking due account of the weather. 'A formal meeting has been arranged to review the incident and to ensure all involved are clear this event was not acceptable and should not occur again.'","Eunice Williams' family were furious, as they had supplied plenty of warm clothing .

They must stay three feet from each other at all times, and 'can't hug', Bruce Johnson, president of the SIM USA mission, said. Mr Johnson said Mr Writebol looked glad to be back in the same country as his wife, despite not being able to visit her yet. 'There was good color in his face,' Mr Johnson said. 'He looked great, interacting. He wasn't emotional. There was a sense of relief that was on his face.' The . Writebols had been in Liberia since August after being sent there by . SIM USA and sponsored by their home congregation at Calvary Church in . Charlotte. Mrs Writebol, 59, was airlifted back to the US when she started showing symptoms of the virus. She was evacuated alongside Dr Kent Brantly, who was also infected with Ebola but is on the road to recovery. Her duties . at an Ebola clinic included disinfecting staff entering or leaving the . treatment area, which may explain how she came to be infected. The . three men in quarantine will be able to go mountain biking round the . 90-acre park, can eat together as long as they are separated and can . play games with the children. Mr Johnson said: '[The men] were amazingly . vibrant this morning when I was with them, So we're really grateful for . their health, their spirit, their attitudes. Scroll down for video . Nancy Writebol is being treated in Atlanta after catching Ebola while working as a missionary in Liberia . 'They've got great space to walk around, along with our six children that are here who came in earlier, and the other two adults. 'What they can't do is hug. '[The quarantine] provides the public the knowledge it is a secure place for their privacy, but it's also a secure place so the public can be reassured of how we're handling this.' Health workers carry the body of an Ebola virus victim in Sierra Leone, where 467 people have died . Mrs Writebol was airlifted from Liberia alongside Dr Kent Brantly, who was working at a Liberian Ebola clinic . SIM USA president Bruce Johnson told journalists that Mr Writebol had a 'sense of relief' on his face after returning to the US mission . Dr Megan Davies, the state epidemiologist, said the missionaries will check in twice a day, updating health officials with their temperatures, or if they have headaches or abdominal pains. Ebola has killed nearly 1,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria in total. It is passed by direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected people, so cannot be passed in the air like many other viruses, such as flu. What is Ebola virus disease? Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees. How do people become infected with the virus? Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. In Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest. Once a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled clothing, bed linen or used needles. Men who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery. Who is most at risk? Those at risk during an outbreak include: . What are the typical signs and symptoms? Sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and internal and external bleeding. The incubation period is between two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms. When should you seek medical care? If a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek medical help immediately. What is the treatment? Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them. But there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients will recover with the appropriate care. Can Ebola be prevented? Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use. Is it safe to travel to affected areas? The World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The risk of infection for travelers is very low since person-to-person transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.

Charlotte Nott nearly died after she was struck down by the most deadly form of the virus in December 2010. She can now walk in comfort for the first time after an anonymous donor paid for a pair of sparkly pink prosthetic legs .

'They are so comfortable that she can now walk properly for the first time since her operations,' Ms Daniels from Oxford told The Sun. 'There's no stopping her now. It's fantastic.' Jenny and partner Alex Nott were preparing to leave for a pre-Christmas family holiday in Lanzarote when Charlotte developed Meningococcal Septicaemia. Jenny noticed the tell-tale purple marks that identify the deadly infection on Charlotte's chest and called paramedics. Charlotte was rushed to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford and within hours suffered multiple organ failure. Doctors battled to stop the disease from spreading, but after five days her fingers and toes had turned black. She had gangrene brought on by septicaemia and had to have all four of her limbs removed in January 2011. Mrs Nott said:  ‘For about four days it looked as though Charlotte might not make it. I just sat by her bed in the hospital, stroking her hair, and telling her, “Mummy loves you, daddy loves you, George loves you” over and over again. ‘If she was going to die I wanted her to die knowing how loved she was and that we all adored her.’ Touch and go: Charlotte pictured during her life and death battle with meningitis .

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . She has a wardrobe to rival Victoria Beckham's, wore a dazzling Alexander McQueen gown to tie the knot and is a member of the Royal family. No, we're not talking about the Duchess of Cambridge, but another glossy member of the family who's been hiding in her shadow - until now. Meet Sara Parker Bowles, the wife of food critic an Camilla's son Tom Parker Bowles. Scroll down for video . The other stylish royal: Sara Parker Bowles is married to Camilla's son Tom and has a wardrobe even more enviable than the Duchess of Cambridge's . Sara, who married Tom back in 2005 in a dress designed by Sarah Burton in St. Nicholas' Anglican Church in Rotherfield Grey, Oxfordshire, has never been one to court the media's attention. 'It's lovely to have all of that attention, but having everybody dissecting what you look like, what you're wearing - it's quite a strange thing,' she told The Telegraph's Ellie Plithers. However, away from the camera's glare, the 40-something stylista is making waves in the fashion industry. She worked as PA to Alexandra Shulman, the editor of British Vogue, but claims she was the 'worst PA in the world'.

'Justine Picardie, who was deputy editor of Vogue at the time, totally saved me and took me into the features fold,' she told The Telegraph. She now works as an associate editor of Harper's Bazaar, and senior editor of Town & Country magazine, as well as mothering her two children, Lola, 6, and son, Freddy, 4. So does the Duchess of Cambridge seek style advice from her? 'We've talked about designers we admire in the past and she's always very complimentary about what I wear but, clearly, she feels she's got more important things to think about - and that's what makes her so endearing,' revealed Sara. Fashion's darling: Sara currently works as an associate editor at Harper's Bazaar and loves the tailored look - but she buys her shoes from sample sales! She seems quite at home in the Royal family, who she describes as a 'completely relaxed' set. Sara revealed that  The Duchess of Cornwall is quite the hands-on grandmother who apparently loves to cook roast dinners and scrambled eggs for the whole family. A regular on the front row, she loves to wear J Brand jeans - Kate's favourite - as well as  Christopher Kane shirts and tuxedo-style style blazers from the Olsen twins' brand The Row. As for accessories, only Celine totes will do and while she loves Manolo Blahnik, Jimmy Choo and Charlotte Olympia shoes, proving she's a down-to-earth fashion fan, she always snaps up the bargains at sample sales.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott for MailOnline . Transgender model Geena Rocero has opened up about her decision to finally come clean with her birth gender during a powerful TED talk in March, 12 years into her career as a successful lingerie model. 'I carried the paranoia [of being found out] with me every day,' the 30-year-old New York-based model tells Glamour, explaining that in part, she wanted to beat the 'salacious . gossip pages' who could discover her secret at any time; a secret that even her own modeling agency didn't know. 'There . was always that fear: What if people found out? They'd think I'd duped . them, and maybe I'd lose my regular clients. It could ruin my career.' Scroll down for video . Ending the fear: In part, Geena Rocero (pictured May 3) wanted to beat the 'salacious gossip pages' who could discover her secret at any time, one that even her own modeling agency didn't know . Two minutes into her generic TED speech about being 'true' to oneself, Miss Rocero broke the news: 'I was assigned a boy at birth based on the appearance of my . genitalia.' Despite her fears that the truth could . ruin her career, Miss Rocero's TED talk earned her a standing ovation, . over two million online views, and widespread positive attention. The commitment to go public struck her while she was in Tulum, Mexico, on her 30th birthday last year. 'I don't give a damn anymore. I'm ready to share my full journey as a woman,' she told her boyfriend at the time. Transformed: 'I was assigned a boy at birth based on the appearance of my genitalia,' the model announced in March, pictured as a child in the Philippines (left) and June 4 (right) Her agent at Next Management, Rob Gerad, was 'stunned' when he heard the news, having had 'no idea' his model had been born a boy, but gives her 'a lot of credit' for her brave public announcement. Miss Rocero was born to a working-class family in the Manila region of the Philippines, and never once felt either like a boy or a 'gay' boy. Fortunately - unlike so many others, she points out - she not only had the unwavering support of both parents from a young age, but she lived in a part of the world where the transgender community thrives. 'I don't give a damn anymore. I'm ready to share my full journey as a woman' Still, Miss Rocero went to a Catholic school and was required to wear a boys uniform - which she altered to at least fit her in a more feminine way - and was still teased and insulted on occasion. At the age . of 15, Miss Rocero was encouraged to compete in a prestigious . transgender pageant, and came second. She went on to win many more, and . used her earnings to buy hormones that helped her grow breasts and adopt . more womanly attributes; in spite of her fears for the drugs' safety. She . was 17 when she moved to the U.S. to join her mother in San Francisco. To her enormous delight, the move meant she could change her name and . identify as a 'female' on immigration records. Receiving . her female driver's license was a moment she will never forget. 'Getting that license, to me, was a license to live,' she recalls. The big reveal: Just two minutes into her TED talk (pictured) Miss Rocero spilled the news, triggering a standing ovation, two million online views, and widespread acceptance . Not long afterwards, Miss Rocero had her sexual reassignment surgery, which she says rendered her 'perfect down there', and moved to New York to fulfill her dream of becoming a model. 'When I became a model I thought I had finally achieved the dream that I had always wanted since I was little,' she said in her TED talk. 'My outside self finally matched my inner self.' 'If someone had asked, I would have told them. It wasn't about passing as a woman' Her slender, balanced proportions found her much work with lingerie brands - an 'ultimate validation' of her femininity, she says - and she went on to model for clients including Macy's. Crucially, moving to a new city as a new woman meant Miss Rocero could make new friends without disclosing any details of her old self. 'If someone had asked, I would have told them,' she says. 'It wasn't about passing as a woman, about ""nobody can tell."" It was about expressing my unique femininity.' She did make sure to inform men who she was in relationships with, which prompted mixed responses. Moving on up: After the TED talk, Miss Rocero (pictured last month) co-founded Gender Proud, a global awareness campaign that fights for transgender rights . One man, upon being told, drove Miss Rocero home in silence before simply remarking that her 'big knees' should have given her away. Another much more serious boyfriend, however, reacted by hugging her and thanking her for her courage. That relationship later dissolved because the pair were at 'different phases' in their lives. It was a different, more recent boyfriend, who prompted her to share her story with the world as they sat on the beach in Mexico together. After the TED talk, Miss Rocero co-founded Gender Proud; a global awareness campaign that fights for transgender rights. According to her, 89per cent of people in the U.S. currently believe that transgender people deserve the same rights and legal protections as others. Despite this encouraging statistic, Miss Rocero feels there is 'still a long way to go' - something that parents of transgender children especially need to recognize. 'Having the space to self-identify with a gender we weren't born with is a conversation we should have with parents, with colleagues, with friends. 'There is still a lot of work that needs to be done. Parents need to approach a child [during gender self-identity] with curiosity and openness.'","Miss Rocero was born in the Philippines and moved to the U.S. when she was .

A middle aged man was taken unconscious from the stands and taken to hospital during the third quarter of the team's opening preseason match, according to reports. The Santa Clara Fire Department said a man was given CPR at the stadium before being taken to O'Connor Hospital in neighboring San Jose where he was pronounced dead. A man has died after suffering a heart attack during the San Fransisco 49ers opening preseason match. Emergency services were called to the stands and rushed the man to hospital (pictured) Emergency services say they had an unusually high number of alerts during the game against the Denver Broncos, likely because of the 80-degree heat. According to the San Jose Mercury, a middle-aged man wearing a gold 49ers jersey was rushed out of the lower bowl section of the stadium, which was in direct sunlight. The paper reports that the man was unconscious when he was taken from the stands by the emergency services. A spokesman for the team said: 'The 49ers organization is deeply saddened to hear of the passing of one of our fans earlier today.

'We would like to extend our heartfelt condolences and prayers to his family and friends in this time of sadness.' The team's 34-0 loss to the Broncos and 80-degree heat drove thousands of fans to leave the new stadium midway through the game. The death marks the third person to die at the new Levi's stadium. In October delivery driver Edward Lake II, 60, died while unloading building materials, and in June last year, 63-year-old Donald White after an accident in an elevator shaft. It is also the second fan death during a game in the last two years. In September 2013 a man died after falling from an elevated walkway during a 49ers match against the Green Bay Packers.

The body of Sheila von Wiese Mack is set to to be flown back to Chicago on Wednesday following the socialite's gruesome murder in Bali last week . Heather Mack (left) and Tommy Schaefer (right) have both been charged with murder and could face death by firing squad if they are convicted . Countering the couple's bizarre claim, he added: 'We have already given treatment that is more than normal. We give special attention to her as she is still young. This is a transition period for her.' Police in Bali have revealed that the suspects may be taken to the USA to stand trial, NBC NEWS reports. The broken and battered body of Mrs Mack looks set be flown back to Chicago on Wednesday with an FBI agent posted in Bali currently making arrangements with the US Embassy. Mrs Mack's body was stuffed into this  this blood-stained suitcase after she was murdered (pictured here outside a police station in Nusa Dua) It is believed that the 62-year-old, who had gone on a relaxing ten-day holiday, was bludgeoned to death with a heavy glass ashtray and vase - with such violence that both objects shattered. In what police Commander, Djoko Hariutomo, described as a ‘desperately wild attempt’ to get rid of the body, Mrs Mack was jammed into a suitcase, which was then loaded into a taxi by Mr Schaefer. Both he and Heather Mack then  left the driver waiting outside the St. Regis Resort -  where they had been staying - telling him they would return shortly. After waiting for two hours, the driver noticed blood seeping from the case and drove to the police station, where the gruesome discovery was made. The following day, police tracked down Heather Mack and Mr Schaefer - who were found asleep in a hotel in the Kuta area of Bali, six miles from the St. Regis resort and close to the island's international airport. Curious details continue to emerge about what is already a bizarre inquiry. Mrs Mack and her daughter, Heather, are said to have had a tempestuous relationship for years with police being called to their Chicago home 86 times between 2004 and 2013 . The Jakarta Post reported that the room Mrs Mack was killed in - and where a ‘cleansing ceremony’ to rid it of evil has been conducted by a Hindu priest - was not hers, but was being used by Mr Schaefer. Pathologists have ascertained that she suffered asphyxiation, a broken neck and a broken nose and that she had probably been killed in that room between 6.45am and 10am last Tuesday. During her autopsy, several defensive wounds were also discovered - suggesting Mrs Mack had fought back while being attacked. Heather Mack has complained about the food in her Bali prison as she awaits her trial - above, police inspect the suitcase in which her mother's body was found . Dr Dudut Rustyadi, the forensic chief at Sanglah hospital morgue in Denpasar, said: 'From the wound, we found violence using blunt objects. 'We found many wounds, open wounds and bruises, including wounds on her left arm. We allege that the victim fought.' In the hours leading up to her murder, Mrs Mack had been seen on CCTV footage walking around the hotel lobby at 3.45am, for reasons that have not been suggested by police. But officers have revealed that one sequence on security cameras shows Mrs Mack arguing with her daughter and Mr Schaefer about who should be paying the hotel bill. She was heard by staff telling her daughter that she had paid for Mr Schaefer’s air fare to Bali so the two of them should pay the bill. It was not clear if she was referring to Mr Schaefer’s room, which he is believed to have been sharing with Ms Mack. The luxury St. Regis Resort, Bali - where Mrs Mack was staying before she was allegedly murdered by her daughter, Heather, along with her boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer . But senior police said today that there appeared little doubt that in the hours before she was brutally murdered, Mrs Mack appeared to be a troubled woman. Detectives are trying to establish if she had gone to the room to continue confronting the young couple in the early hours of the morning. A worker at another Bali hotel, who has friends at the St Regis, said he had been told that Mrs Mack was distressed that her daughter was two months pregnant - a fact confirmed by the MailOnline last week. It is not known who the father is, but police said Mr Schaefer was the obvious candidate.","Heather Mack, 19, and boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, accused of murder .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor, MailOnline . President Barack Obama warned on Monday that the U.S. military's missions in Iraq, while limited, will remain an open-ended campaign at least until newly minted Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has established an 'inclusive government' that can appeal to his nation's warring religious and ethnic sects. Asked if he worried about 'mission creep' growing out of an offensive that has seen 68 airstrikes to date, Obama replied that he refuses to be pinned down to a timetable. 'I don't think ... at this point, that I'm prepared to provide a blanket answer to that,' he told reporters at the White House. 'A lot of it depends on how effectively the Iraqi government comes together.' No timetable: Obama said Monday that completing America's anti-ISIS mission would depend largely on the job Haider al-Abadi does in creating an 'inclusive government' that inspires confidence among warring Iraqi religious groups and tribes . Smoke rose during airstrikes targeting ISIS militants at the Mosul Dam in Iraq on Monday, after two days of U.S airstrikes allowed Iraqi and Kurdish forces to regain control of the strategic facility . 'This is going to take time,' Obama . added. 'There are going to be many challenges ahead. Meanwhile, there . should be no doubt that the United States military is going to continue . to carry out the limited missions I have authorized.' U.S. Central Command said Monday that it 'has conducted a total of 68 airstrikes in Iraq' since August 8, when Obama first authorized them. A Pentagon official told MailOnline that the number would soon be elevated to a total of 72. That figure is small by the standards the U.S. has established in previous Middle Eastern conflicts. At their peak in 2011, U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan reached a total of 5,411. Still it indicates that the commander-in-chief is willing to bring a strategic hammer down on ISIS, the terror group that claims it has established an Islamic 'state' across portions of sovereign Iraq and Syria. CENTCOM said about half of its airstrikes to date came in the last few days as Iraqi military forces drove ISIS away from the Mosul Dam, a key piece of infrastructure that could have been used as a tool of terror if it were intentionally breached. Fifteen strikes near the dam, the Pentagon said, were carried out by drones. The sense of urgency Obama said he has communicated to al-Abadi is driven in part by a desire to remove American armed forces from the Iraqi theatre. 'I have been firm from the start that we are not reintroducing thousands of U.S. troops back on the ground to engage in combat,' he said Monday. 'Iraq is going to have to ultimately provide for its own security.' Leaving American armed servicemen and women in place to protect ethnic and religious minorities from a rampaging ISIS is 'not sustainable,' Obama insisted. 'It's not lasting.' The Mosul Dam is the largest such structure in Iraq, making it a ticking time-bomb in the hands of ISIS, but it was recaptured on Monday . Caliphate: ISIS has released its own redrawn map of the Middle East showing regions of Syria and Iraq it now claims to control . ISIS, an acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, has grown 'from a band of 2,000 thugs to a 30,000+ terrorist army,' former Reagan administration Pentagon deputy KT MacFarland said Monday, 'equipped with state-of-the-art military equipment seized from Iraqi Army deserters.' The terror group 'now controls large swaths of Syria and Iraq, has $2 billion in cash and assets, $3 million in daily revenue and controls oil fields and dams, which means it controls most of the water and electricity in Iraq,' she said. And its army 'is butchering, raping and beheading anyone who stands in its way.' Obama, however, remains focused on ensuring that Baghdad has an egalitarian government that caters equally to the complaints of Sunnis, Shias and Kurds. 'They’ve got to get this done,' he told reporters, 'because the wolf’s at the door. And in order for them to be credible with the Iraqi people, they’re going to have to put behind some of the old practices and actually create a credible, united government.' 'We've made significant progress on that front, but we're not there yet,' he conceded. Not our boots on the ground: While American airstrikes have scattered ISIS forces, Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters (pictured) and Iraqi Army regulars recaptured that dam on the Tigris river . Not staying: An open-collared Obama insisted that he won't be dragged into a Bush-style Iraq wa, insisting that 'we are not reintroducing thousands of U.S. troops back on the ground to engage in combat' Al-Abadi, the president said, will help ensure America's national security by 'making sure a savage group that seems willing to slaughter people for no rhyme or reason other than they have not kowtowed to them, that a group like that is contained, because ultimately it can cause a threat to us.' He seemed to be pinning his hope for a smooth exit from Iraq on the belief that Sunni Muslims, a minority group in Iraq, will embrace a strong al-Abadi government and stand up to the murderous ISIS hordes that have overrun parts of the country that they had long controlled. With the success of a credible governing coalition, he said Monday, 'there's the prospect of Sunni tribes who are the primary residents of areas that ISIL now controls, saying, ""We've got a viable option"".' '""And we would rather work with a central government that appears to understand our grievances and is prepared to meet them"",' he suggested they might conclude, '""rather than deal with individuals who don't seem to have any values beyond death and destruction"".' Appearing for his second press conference in a row without a necktie, a tired-looking Obama has taken a few days off from his Martha's Vineyard vacation to receive in-person briefings on the Iraq crisis, and on the continuing civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.","Asked about a timetable, Obama said 'I don't think ... at this point, that I'm prepared to provide a blanket answer'

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . A man who had his leg amputated as a child after eating candy laced with fungal spores meant to poison his father has become a cage fighting champion. Matt Betzold was just six years old when he ate poisoned candy that was meant for his father after Betzold senior fell out with a motorcycle gang. The fungal spores plunged Matt into a six-week coma, and in order to save his life doctors had to amputate his left leg at the knee. However the 30-year-old, father-of-two has now fought his way back to become a professional mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter, recently winning World Fighting Federation's Flyweight champion title. Scroll down for video . Matt Betzold, 30, has won the World Fighting Federation's Flyweight title despite having his left leg amputated below the knee when he was a child . Aged six Betzold ate candy laced with fungal spores that was meant to poison his father, plunging him into a coma. In order to save his life, doctors were forced to amputate his lower left leg . He has accomplished this despite being forced to fight on his knees because regulations ban him from wearing a prosthetic. Matt - aka Legbreaker - said: 'I have as much of an advantage or disadvantage as any other fighter who steps into the cage. We can all find things that work for and against us when we are fighting. 'I don't remember ever being classed as disabled and I have never accepted people telling me that I couldn't do something. 'People may use my lack of a leg as an excuse not to fight me, but it really just boils down to them realising that they won't win. In the ring Betzold is forced to fight from his knees because federation rules ban him from using his prosthetic . The father-of-two says he began fighting at school because he was picked on for having only one leg, but grew to love it as a sport after his brother took him to a dojo fight aged 17 . 'But how can you say you're a fighter, if you're not willing to fight who is put in front of you.' In an interview with ESPN, Mr Betzold said he learned to fight from a young age because he was picked on for having only one leg. In elementary school he began to enjoy fighting, and got into sport  at the age of 17 after his brother took him to watch his very first dojo fight. And ever since Matt, who also teaches MMA, has dedicated his life to the gym and progressed from the amateur division to professional fights. As well as being a champion flyweight fighter, Mr Betzold has also begun teaching the sport . Mr Betzold, who is known in the ring by his nickname 'Legbreaker', says he has as much of an advantage or disadvantage as anyone else in the ring . He said: 'I love the challenge of starting at the bottom and climbing up the ladder of the division. 'And I love proving all of the doubters wrong, and showing my supporters that they were right when I succeed. 'I love going into a fight not knowing how the battle will end and the energy I get from the beginning of the fight camp until the final moments of the fight itself. 'And I love waking up and doing it all over again. I could go on all day about why I love MMA.'","Matt Betzold had his left leg amputated from the knee down aged six .

"By . Leon Watson . Rescue animals are more likely to have a happier outlook in life than their well-reared counterparts, a study has found. In this first scientific study of rescued animals, researchers at Queen Mary, University of London, devised a test to check the optimism of mistreated goats compared to well treated goats. The animals were set lose to look for food while scientists observed whether some of them were faster to explore specific areas that resulted in reward and others that did not. Researchers at Queen Mary, University of London, rescue animals like these are more likely to have a happier outlook in life than their well-reared counterparts . It was expected that the neglected animals would be more 'pessimistic' about exploring unknown locations for food, where the promise of reward was not guaranteed. But surprisingly the resilient females of the mistreated group were more optimistic than their well-treated counterparts and keener to investigate. Co-author of the study, Dr Elodie Briefer from Queen Mary's School of Biological and Chemical Science, said: 'In this case, we found that female goats that had been previously neglected were the most optimistic of all the tested animals. 'They were more optimistic than well-treated females, but also the poorly treated males. Happy outlook: Springer spaniels at Battersea Dog's Home in south London look out from the back of the organisation's animal ambulance . Researchers found that animal sanctuaries can play an important role in rehabilitating goats and other animals that have suffered from neglect . 'This suggests that females may be . better at recovering from neglect when released from stress, and might . have implications for animal sanctuaries in how they tailor the care . they provide for the different sexes.' The study concluded that animal sanctuaries can play an important role in rehabilitating goats and other animals that have suffered from neglect. Of the 18 goats that were examined, nine had come from a background of inappropriate diet, and lack of space or shelter. It was these nine that responded most positively to the tests. Dr Alan McElligott, also from Queen Mary's School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, said: 'The study shows that animal rescue centres, such as Buttercups Sanctuary for Goats, where we collected our data, can provide a vital role in reversing long-term neglect once the animals receive excellent care.'","Researchers at Queen Mary, University of London, carried out study .

Cosby's defense lawyer claimed the victim Harris pulled out a lipstick knife and slashed Cosby. Cosby then grabbed the knife and stabbed her in the temple (stock image) In April, a military jury convicted Cosby of murder and obstruction of justice and recommended a life sentence. Last week, U.S. Marine Corps Pacific commander, Lieutenant General Terry Robling, who has ultimate say on the case, agreed and upheld the sentence. He will also be dishonorably discharged. Cosby's lawyer said Cosby had been drinking for 10 hours when he met Harris at a bar and took her back to his hotel room. At some point, Harris woke Cosby up and said 'you need to pay me.' When Cosby tried to push her out of the hotel room, Harris pulled out a razor blade knife hidden in a lipstick tube and slashed Cosby across the arm, defense attorney Lieutenant Colonel Clay A. Plummer told a jury, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.

"By . Michael Zennie for MailOnline . A North Carolina mother who had two infant sons die in an 18 month span while she was sleeping with them has been charged with manslaughter. Katherine Jennings, 33, was arrested in Charlotte on Tuesday and taken across the state to Brunswick County to face charges in the death of Luke Stephen Phillips. Luke was eight months old when he died on December 13, 2013 while Jennings lived in Oak Island, near Wilmington, North Carolina. Medical examiners ruled the infant's death an accident, finding that he suffocated while he was sleeping with Jennings. Katherine Jennings, 33, had two sons die while she was sleeping with them in an 18 month time span - the last in December 2013 . In June 2012,  Jennings' first son, James Robert 'Bo' Phillips, died when he was four months old. That death was ruled an accident, but later the cause was changed to 'undetermined.' The medical examiner said the fact that he had been sleeping with Jennings was a factor in his death. Co-sleeping - the practice of infants sleeping with their parents - is a contentious issue in America. Most parents say they do it at least sometimes. However, many cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome that are reported every year actually show signs of being suffocation deaths from sleeping. The American Academy of Pediatrics says infants should be put to sleep in a crib with no blankets or pillows. Experts say parents can accidentally suffocate their children while they are sleeping - and never realize until it's too late. According to the Charlotte Observer, Jennings told police that when her second son, Luke, died, he was laying face up in her arms. Booked: Jennings was arrested in Charlotte and taken across the state to Wilmington, where she was charged with manslaughter . Brunswick County Assistant District Attorney Lee Bollinger told MailOnline he has never prosecuted a co-sleeping case before. He told MailOnline: 'She’s had two infants die and so that automatically makes this case different from folks who have an isolated incident of a child’s death.' He declined to say, however, exactly what factors went into deciding to charge Jennings. Jennings' husband, Seth Phillips, serves in the Coast Guard and was not home when either child died, according to the newspaper. The couple also have a four-year-old daughter. The Observer reports that Jennings has at least four arrests for drunk driving in her native Georgia, including one in 2007.","Katherine Jennings, 33, was arrested in Charlotte for the December 2013 death of 8-month-old Luke Phillips, who died while sleeping with her .

"By . Peter Allen . A young woman was in hospital yesterday following a 'miracle escape' after being stranded for 36 hours on a paddle board in the English Channel. Clemence Lapayre, 24, set off for a moonlit stroke on Sunday night following a holiday meal with her family in Normandy, northern France. But as she pushed out from the town of Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, she suddenly realised she was getting further and further away from the shore. Clemnce Lapayre, 24, was swept out to sea after going for a midnight swim on her paddle board from this village on the Normandy coast . Soon she was in open sea, and being battered by huge waves, high winds and strong currents which threatened to pull her under. Her uncle, Christophe Remy Nerys, told the BFM TV news channel: 'We had had a great night and she decided to paddle under the moonlight without telling us. 'It was not until later the next day we realized she was gone. 'She fell off her board three times. Apparently she tried her best to stay conscious and cling to her board and not let go,' Mr Nerys added. Air and sea searches were launched on Monday but rescuers could not locate the paddle boarder, a fit and experienced sailor. Paddle boarding became popular in California in the 1980s before being exported to Europe . After spending two nights desperately trying to stay on her board, she was finally found on Tuesday at around 3.30 pm, having drifted around 70 miles. She was discovered just off the port of Le Havre by a Belgian fishing boat, and was able to alert her sister to see she was safe. A spokesman for France's national maritime rescue service SNCM said it was a 'miracle' she had been found alive. They said she faced four metre high swells and winds of up to 40 knots. Rescuers took her by boat to the hospital in the town of Fecamp. Paddleboarding is a cross between canoeing and surfing in which paddlers propel themselves across open water while standing up on their boards. It has historic roots, and became particularly popular on the West Coast of America in the 1980s, before being exported to Europe. Ms Lapayre lives in Paris, and is thought to originally come from Canada.","Clemence Lapayre, 24, went for moonlit paddle on Sunday while on holiday .

"By . Michael Zennie for MailOnline . Retired baseball star Curt Schilling has revealed that he is battling mouth cancer - and says it was caused by 30 years of chewing tobacco at ball games. Schilling told the WEEI/NESN Jimmy Fund Radio Telethon today that has has undergone seven excruciating weeks of chemotherapy, lost his sense of taste and smell and dropped 75lbs following rigorous treatment at Brigham & Women's  Hospital in Boston. The 47-year-old father of four says he has been fighting the disease since February and is currently in remission. Former Boston Red Sox great Curt Schilling was last seen in public in May after being diagnosed with cancer in February . He said he never felt sorry for himself after the cancer diagnosis and never wondered 'Why me?' - because he believes he brought the disease on himself. 'I do believe without a doubt, unquestionably that chewing is what gave me cancer and I'm not going to sit up here from the pedestal and preach about chewing. I will say this: I did for about 30 years,' he told the Boston radio station. 'It was an addictive habit. I can think of so many times in my life when it was so relaxing to just sit back and have a dip and do whatever. 'And I lost my sense of smell, my taste buds for the most part. I had gum issues, they bled, all this other stuff. None of it was enough to ever make me quit. 'The pain that I was in going through this treatment, the second or third day it was the only thing in my life that had that I wish I could go back and never have dipped. Not once. It was so painful.' The treatment was so horrible, he said, that after just three sessions, he could no longer undergo the process without first being given drugs to calm his nerves. Schilling, who chewed tobacco for 30 years, believes the habit caused the cancer that resulted in him losing his sense of taste and smell . Schilling's announcement comes in the wake of baseball Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn death from cancer at age 54 in June. Gwynn had also blamed his cancer on his habit of chewing tobacco. Schilling was the hero of 2004 the Red Sox playoff run that ended in the team's first World Series victory in 86 years. He pitched a World Series game and a decisive playoff game against with an ankle injury that led to him bleeding through his sock on live TV. Schillings cool performance on the mount is now part of baseball lore and the World Series sock is in the Hall of Fame. He retired in 2009 after 20 seasons in the majors that included four World Series appearances and three wins. He was voted co-MVP in 2001 when he helped lead the Arizona Diamondbacks to victory over the Yankees. Schilling is currently being sued by Rhode Island's economic development agency after his video game company received a $75 million state loan guarantee and then collapsed. Schilling is being treated at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He received seven weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatments and is in remission. He says he's lost 75 pounds. Schilling is a three-time World Series champion with the Arizona Diamondbacks and Boston Red Sox.","Curt Schilling was diagnosed with cancer in February and endured seven weeks of extricating chemotherapy .

"By . Michael Zennie for MailOnline . Transformation: Leslie Fabian writes about learning to love her husband after he changed his gender . Leslie Hilburn Fabian is a straight woman who married a man. But, over 23 years of marriage, she has convinced herself to become a lesbian - evolving her sexual preferences as her husband David became Deborah. When Mrs Fabian first met her husband in 1991, he was dressed as a woman at a party. Though he occasionally cross-dressed, he lived as a man - a successful New England surgeon - the rest of his life. After years of marriage, however, she realized that David was yearning to do more than just wear skirts on the weekend; he wanted to become a Deborah - his female alter-ego full-time. Mrs Fabian has written a book about how her partner's change in identity led to her changing her sexuality, as well. 'My Husband's a Woman Now: A Shared Journey of Transition and Love' was released in February. She detailed some of her trials in a column for the Washington Post today. Mrs Fabian says that she and her husband had an active sex life when they were first married. However, that eventually faded as David began to identify as a woman more. Mrs Fabian wrote in the Post: 'While my comfort with fantasy enabled me to support Deb’s presence in our bedroom, I sometimes longed for a scenario other than pretending we were both women during love-making.' Eventually, David grew more depressed about his male identity. After 20 years of marriage and a parade of medication and psychologists for her husband, Mrs Fabian finally told him: 'I don’t think another therapist or a different antidepressant will work. It’s time to talk to an endocrinologist.' Mrs Fabian (left) says she has learned to be satisfied with her supportive partner Deborah after she underwent a sex change following 20 years of marriage . At first the transition was difficult for Mrs Fabian. She said she refused to touch her husband's chest when he started sprouting breasts. The hormones he was taking sapped his libido. 'There was no denying I was a “hopeless heterosexual,” as my lesbian sister once teased me. The sexual side of our relationship faded; I was losing my lover,' she wrote. But she says she leaned on the tender emotional connection that she and her partner maintained throughout their relationship to keep the relationship together. And now, three years after David came out as Deborah full-time, she says she had found new satisfaction in her marriage to a woman - and her new own new sexual identity as a lesbian. 'We connect through deep discussions, mutual discovery and respect, caring and generosity. We focus on non-sexual ways of expressing love — cuddling, gentle caresses, holding hands. These interactions became more critical to our relationship than frequent sexual expression,' she writes.",Leslie Hilburn Fabian has written about the trials of learning to be a lesbian after her husband underwent a sex change .
"By . Reuters . A Colorado woman appeared in court on Monday for the first time after being charged with abusing her 7-year-old daughter who suffered from seizures and was unable to walk or speak when found living amid squalor, prosecutors said. Leah Dyer, 47, of Fort Collins is charged with one count of felony child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury, said Linda Jensen, spokeswoman for the Larimer County District Attorney's Office. Her husband, Douglas Dyer, 44, faces the same charge. Both are free on $10,000 bonds. Facing charges: Leah Dyer (left) , 47, and Douglas Dyer (right), 44, are charged with child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury . Child protection services and police removed the girl from the home last October, according to an arrest warrant affidavit posted on the Fort Collins Coloradoan newspaper's website. An informant told police that the girl was treated for seizures in 2009, but had not seen a physician since then nor received any medication, the affidavit said. Authorities found the girl lying on the floor of the cat feces-littered home wearing a diaper, and unable to speak, stand or hold her head up, the document said. While investigators were inside the home, the girl suffered a seizure and was rushed to a hospital, the affidavit said. Douglas Dyer told police he did not believe the girl was undergoing seizures, and instead called them 'spells.' Filthy: When police arrived at the Colorado home it was covered in cat feces and dirt . 'He (Dyer) said they looked into the spiritual realm but they ran into roadblocks in trying to have their home blessed to get rid of the spirits,' the affidavit said. The couple told investigators they did not take the girl for follow-up medical appointments after the 2009 diagnosis because their vehicle was broken, and 'they didn't want to bother their friends,' the affidavit said. The girl weighed just 37 pounds when she was taken from the home, authorities said. Now aged 8, she has gained more than 20 pounds and has grown six inches since she was removed from the Dyer home 10 months ago, authorities said. 'Now after having her nutritional and medical needs met; and receiving speech, occupational and physical therapy (the girl) has made tremendous gains to the point she is now standing with help, communicating with sounds and signs,' police said. Douglas Dyer is due in court next month for a preliminary hearing, according to court records.","Leah Dyer, 47, of Fort Collins is charged with one count of felony child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury and appeared in court today .

"By . Michael Zennie for MailOnline . The Ivy League-educated girlfriend of a New York banana tycoon was so badly battered and abused by her married boyfriend that she once wrote on the back of a photograph 'if you find me dead, Thomas Hoey did it,' prosecutors have alleged. Despite her chilling words and what prosecutors say was years of abuse so brutal that she lost hearing in one ear and had her teeth chipped, Alison Bretherick is standing by her man - and fighting the Manhattan District Attorney's attempt to send Hoey away for beating her. Hoey, 46, is already facing up to 11 years in prison after he admitted that he refused to call 911 when another mistress, personal trainer Kimberley Calo, overdosed on cocaine that he had given her following a three-way sex romp at a luxury Manhattan hotel in 2009. Miss Bretherick was not with Hoey the night Calo died. Standing by her man: Alison Bretherick, 29, (pictured in May, left and last week, right) has appeared in court in support of boyfriend Thomas Hoey - despite years of alleged abuse and fears for her life . Facing prison: Thomas Hoey, 46, seen here in 2009, faces 11 years in prison after admitting he didn't call for help when a mistress overdosed on cocaine. He faces four more over charges he beat Alison Bretherick . The New York Post reports that Miss Bretherick, 29, is refusing to cooperate with authorities as they pursue charges that he savagely beat her and left her with a bloody scalp in 2012. She has even even showed up in court to support her alleged abuser. If convicted, Hoey could have four more years tacked on to his prison term. In court filings, prosecutors detail how Miss Bretherick was a promising University of Pennsylvania graduate who had just gotten into an executive training program at Macy's when she met Hoey in 2008, according to the Post. Hoey, the millionaire owner of the Long Island Banana Corp., had seen Miss Bretherick on the street on the Upper West Side and had one of his bodyguards stop her and tell her his boss wanted to meet her. On their first date, he picked her up in a limo and 'accidentally' spilled soup on her dress -- then showed her two new outfits he had already picked out for her. Kimberley Calo, a New York personal trainer, overdosed on cocaine after having a threesome with millionaire Hoey in 2009. She died when no one called for help . As the relationship progressed, however, Miss Bretherick was the victim of regular, brutal abuse at Hoey's hands, prosecutors alleged. According to the Post, police say he beat her for not picking up the phone fast enough and once bashed her head through a wall. The abuse chipped her teeth and left her with no hearing in her left ear, according to authorities. Miss Bretherick has publicly refused to turn on Hoey, but in 2010 she admitted to her cousin that she was terrified of him, authorities say. She wrote 'If you find me dead, Thomas Hoey did it' on the back of a photograph of her grandfather and showed it to her cousin, according to court documents. However, when a judge granted a protective order barring Hoey from seeing her in May, Miss Bretherick protested, telling the judge: 'I savor my trips to see Tom in jail; they are the highlight to my week.'","Thomas Hoey, the millionaire owner of Long Island Banana Corp, faces four years in prison for allegedly beating girlfriend Alison Bretherick in 2012 .

"By . Michael Zennie for MailOnline . Before Texas Governor Rick Perry's criminal indictment, before national attention turned its focus to the state capital Austin and Perry's 2016 presidential ambitions - Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg was arrested for drunk driving. Lehmberg, a Democrat, is one of the most powerful prosecutors in the state. She had a blood alcohol level of 0.239percent - nearly three times the legal limit - when she was arrested in April 2013. Jailhouse video shows her drunk, belligerent, threatening officers, kicking the door of her cell and repeatedly trying to pull rank in the Travis County Detention Center. Perry called for Lehmberg, an elected official, to step down after her arrest. She refused and he responded by vetoing funding for her office, which operates an ethics unit that investigates public corruption. On Friday, a grand jury charged Perry, a Republican, with abusing the power of his office. Scroll down for video . Busted: Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg was arrested for drunk driving in April 2013. She had a blood alcohol level of 0.239percent - nearly three times the legal limit . Combative: In jail, Lehmberg was belligerent and verbally abusive to jail guards. She can be seen here kicking the door to her cell . Officers put a spit mask on Lehmberg, normally reserved for prisoners who spit on jail guards (left). She was also strapped into a chair that immobilized her . Jail guards say Lehmberg was so combative that they had to put her in a restraint that immobilized her hands and feet. They also put a spit mask over her face . Videos from Lehmberg's arrest are not new to Texans, but the indictment against Perry calls new attention to the prosecutor's behavior after she was booked into jail on April 12. 'Y'all better do something quick or y'all are the ones that's gonna be in jail, not me,' she tells officers who are searching her. She repeatedly yells at jailers to 'call Greg,' a reference to Travis County Sheriff Greg Hamilton. At one point, when an officer tells her that she's been arrested for drunken driving, she shrugs and says, 'That's y'alls' problem, not mine.' Lehmberg eventually pleaded guilty, but it is Perry who could be sent to prison for up to 99 years. On Friday, a grand jury indicted the governor on two felony counts, abusing his official capacity and coercing a public servant. The charges stem from the political maneuvering that came after Lehmberg's arrest. The legal basis for Governor Rick Perry's felony indictment comes from the fact that he was exerting influence on an elected official. After Rosemary Lehmberg, who is the elected District Attorney of Travis County, was arrested on drunk driving charges, Perry publicly demanded that she step down. He threatened to veto funding for Lehmberg's office, which operates a high-profile unit that investigates official corruption. When Lehmberg didn't resign, Perry followed through with his threats. Perry's attempts to force Lehmberg to step down led to his indictment. Lehmberg remains in office after spending nearly a month in jail. Her term expires at the end of this year. Perry and his Republican allies - and even a few Democrats - have called the indictment politically-motivated. The veteran prosecutor immediately announced she would stay in office until her term ended. Perry, a Republican who is exploring a second run for president, called on Lehmberg to step down and threatened to veto state funding for her office if she didn't. He then acted on his threats and cut off funding to her office - which among other things pursues ethics investigations against Texas officials. Lehmberg was responsible for pursuing corruption charges against former U.S. House Speaker Tom DeLay and other Republicans. Perry, who will soon face his own time in the Travis County lockup, has condemned the indictment, calling it a violation of the 'rule of law' and claiming it is politically motivated. 'This is not the way that we settle differences, political differences in this country,' Perry told 'Fox News Sunday.' 'You don't do it with indictments. We settle our political differences at the ballot box.' He stood by his calls for Lehmberg - who remains in officer being being sentenced to 45 days in jail - to resign. He said that she was 'abusive' to jail staff and cited her extremely high blood alcohol level. Defiant: A grand jury found Texas Governor Rick Perry abused his power when he demanded that Lehmberg step down and then cut off funding to her office. He has denounced the charges . Video from the Travis County Sheriff's Office shows Lehmberg being uncooperative and belligerent almost from the time she was pulled over on April 12 after swerving into a bicycle lane. She repeatedly demands that the officer call the sheriff, At one point she says, 'He’s not going to let me sit in jail all night. That’s crazy.' In the video, jail officers and sheriff's deputies tell her that they have spoken with Sheriff Hamilton and that he instructed them to treat her like any other drunk driving suspect. When she repeatedly refuses to cooperate with officers, they place her in a restraint, shackling her arms, legs and hands. They place a spit mask over her face. Lehmberg denied spitting at officers. Records show she remained in the restraint for more than two hours - including while her blood was drawn for a blood alcohol test.","Rosemary Lehmberg, Austin's top prosecutor, was arrested for drunk driving in April 2013 and later pleaded guilty .

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . A man who paid a drug addict just £1,000 to kill his wife because he was having an affair with her sister was convicted has been convicted of murder. Mother-of-two Amina Bibi was stabbed at least 70 times in the attack at the couple's flat in Forest Gate, east London. Her 11-year-old son found her dying in a pool of blood when he returned to his home after forgetting his homework on the morning of Friday September 13. Husband Mohamed Ali, 65, was heavily in debt and having an affair with his sister-in-law in Pakistan when he approached drug addict Frederick Best, 47. Scroll down for video . Mother-of-two Amina Bibi was stabbed at least 70 times by an addict paid . by her husband Mohamed Ali (right). Mrs Bibi had savings in the house and officers believe the debt and his affair could have been a motive . Mrs Bibi had significant savings in the house and officers believe the debt and affair could have been a motive for Ali to have his wife murdered. Ali did the school run to give himself an alibi but had already given a key to the flat to Best. But the killer was disturbed by the 11-year-old after the stabbing and fled. Mrs Bibi, 43, who had been married 14 years, was stabbed more than 70 times and  pronounced dead at the scene. Best claimed he was offered £1,000 to burgle the flat but had entered to find Mrs Bibi's body. Ali denied he was having an affair. Guilty: Crack cocaine addict Frederick Best claimed that he was paid £1,000 to burgle Ali's flat. He was convicted of murder . But police identified Ali on CCTV speaking with another man outside the flat prior to the murder taking place. Officers seized Ali's two mobile phones. One contained family and friend's contacts but the other held only numbers for Pakistan and a UK mobile phone number called frequently at the time of the murder. This turned out to be the number of Best, who also matched the description of the male seen speaking to Ali on the CCTV prior to the murder taking place. Best was arrested at his home four days after the murder. Ali was arrested soon afterwards. The pair were both charged with the murder of Amina Bibi on Thursday, 19 September. Ali knew Best from when he owned a shop in Forest Gate in the early 1990s. Best used to hang around the shop and Ali knew that he had a drug habit. They lost touch but met some 15 years later by chance in 2013 and swapped numbers. It was then that police believe Ali hatched a plan to have his wife killed by Best. The crack cocaine addict claimed in interview that he was paid £1,000 to burgle Ali's flat. He said that he went into the address to carry out the fake burglary and found her lying on the floor covered in blood. He alleged that someone had attacked her before he entered. But Ali and Best were convicted of murder at Woolwich Crown Court. They will be sentenced at a later date. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Whellams, of the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'This was a cold and calculated act planned and devised by Mohamed Ali to have the mother of his two sons killed. 'He recruited Fred Best, a man with a drug dependency, to carry out the murder for the price of some jewellery and cash. He arranged for Best to attend his flat on the morning in question where he left open the communal doors allowing Best access to his flat. 'He also gave Best a key to his front door to gain entry to the flat while Ali used the 'school run' to provide himself with an alibi, secure in the knowledge that his unsuspecting wife was at home alone. Horrific: The killer was disturbed by the 11-year-old after the stabbing and fled. The boy had forgotten his homework and returned home, finding his mother dying . 'Within a minute of Ali leaving with his youngest child, Best entered and carried out a ferocious attack on Mrs Bibi, stabbing her approximately 70 times. 'It was during this attack that Best was disturbed by the eldest child - who had returned to the home address on realising that he had forgotten his home work. 'The sound of desperate knocking on the window and front door caused Best to panic and flee. 'Unfortunately Amina Bibi's son will have to carry with him the tragic memory of the events of that day forever. 'Although Ali played the part of a loving and concerned husband and father, his story soon began to unravel. 'Both he and Best were arrested within days of the offence and although they tried to cover their tracks it soon became apparent that they were responsible. This was a complicated investigation solved by hard-working and dedicated officers. 'This is a tragic case which has left two children without their mother and father, and also with them the knowledge that one of the parents was responsible for the death of the other. 'I only hope that over time the memory of it will fade in the minds of the children and that they will be able to overcome this tragic and brutal incident.'","Mother-of-two Amina Bibi was stabbed at least 70 times in her London flat .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Scientists believe there are around one million near-Earth asteroids that could pose a threat to our planet – but only a tiny fraction have so far been detected. The threat is so serious that former astronaut Ed Lu has described it as ‘cosmic roulette’ and said that only ‘blind luck’ has so far saved humanity from a serious impact. Now the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space has created a special action team to deal with the problem. Scientists believe there are around one million near-Earth asteroids that could post a threat to our planet – but only a tiny fraction have so far been detected. Now the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space has created a special action team to deal with dangers posed by near-Earth asteroids . Dubbed the International Analysis and Warning Network (IAWN), the team will gather and analyse information on asteroids to warn governments of a potential threat. According to Leonard David writing for Space.com, a number of groups already exist to monitor the asteroid threat, but the IAWN hopes to combine their expertise. Another group, called the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG), is also hoping to promote international collaboration to deflect threatening asteroids. For the first time, SMPAG (pronounced ‘same page’) is allowing national space agencies from North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa to coordinate their reaction to asteroid threats . Asteroid 2014 AA, discovered by the the Catalina Sky Survey on January 1, 2014, as it moved across the sky . Dramatic proof that any of these can strike Earth came on 15 February last year, when an unknown object exploded high above Chelyabinsk, Russia, with 20–30 times the energy of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. There have been a number of technological – and bizarre - solutions to deal with the threat. For instance, earlier this year US researchers revealed an audacious plan to blow up asteroid approaching Earth with nuclear weapons. The Iowa team outlined their vision at a Nasa conference, and say they would need just a weeks’ notice to launch if the system were developed. Called the Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle, or HAIV, the craft would rendezvous with an asteroid in deep space. It consists of a leader spacecraft, which would hit the comet and create blast crater. Around a millisecond later, a follower spacecraft carrying nuclear explosives would hit inside the crater - which increases its effectiveness by up to 20 times. The resulting shock wave caused widespread damage and injuries, making it the largest known natural object to have entered the atmosphere since the 1908 Tunguska event, which destroyed a forest area of Siberia. Its not just the world's space agencies that are pooling their talents. Nasa has turned to the public to find asteroid hunters that could help save the planet. Nasa is offering up to $35,000 (£21,000) to anyone who is able develop computer code that can identify life-threatening asteroids. The bounty is part of its Asteroid Data Hunter contest which plans to reduce the number of false positives found in images from ground-based telescopes. Over the past two decades, Nasa has been looking for dangerous near-Earth asteroids larger than 1km in size, and claims to have found 98 per cent of them. But existing asteroid detection systems can only track one per cent of the estimated objects that orbit the sun, according to asteroid mining firm Planetary Resources, who is partnering with Nasa on the project. In a session at the SXSW conference in Texas earlier this, Nasa scientist Jason Kessler said: ‘The likelihood of something hitting us in the future is pretty guaranteed, although we’re not freaking out that there is an imminent threat.’ The threat is so serious that former astronaut Ed Lu (right) has described it as ‘cosmic roulette’ and said that only ‘blind luck’ has so far saved humanity from a serious impact. Here he is pictured with Yuri Malenchenko .","There are around one million potentially dangerous near-Earth asteroids .

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . A gang of Romanian fraudsters have been jailed for between 21 and 64 months for stealing an estimated £16 million-worth of bank card details from more than 60,000 people in the UK and abroad. Three men and a woman appeared at the Old Bailey for sentencing after pleading guilty to a string of fraud offences after police uncovered what they described as a 'fraudster's utopia' in Harrow, Middlesex. Prosecutor Catherine Pattison said the defendants - who were living at addresses in the area - were responsible for 'a large-scale, highly sophisticated, well executed ATM and counterfeit fraud'. Facing jail: Florin Ioan Silaghi, 30, Vasile Daniel Pop, 30, Ovidiu Metac, 27 and Adriana Alexandra Turc, 25, (top left to bottom right) ran a gang who targeted more than 60,000 bank customers in a £16million fraud . The criminal operation was smashed in December last year when police seized an array of gadgets including cards traps, cloned cards and spy cameras in raids. The gang were involved in three stages of fraud - scamming bank card data from ATMs, downloading it on to a computer and then copying the details on to counterfeit plastic cards, Ms Pattison said. In all, 953 bank accounts had been compromised and a total of £161,607.47 was taken, although the potential loss was far greater, she said. Money was then transferred abroad to Panama, Romania, Italy and Colombia using MoneyGram and Western Union, the court was told. The prosecutor said Florin Silaghi and Vasile Pop were the key players in the conspiracy, and Ovidiu Metac and his partner Adriana Turc had lesser roles. They all pleaded guilty at earlier hearings to conspiracy to defraud between January 1 2012 and December 11 2013 and various other related offences. Silaghi was jailed for 64 months, Pop was handed 61 months, Turc was jailed for 21 months and Metac was jailed for 43 months. Jailing them, recorder Douglas Day QC said: 'Electronic card fraud is one of the scourges of the technological age both nationally and internationally. 'It causes significant loss to the banks and distress and inconvenience to the card holders whose cards have been compromised.' Silaghi, 30, of  Harrow, also admitted possessing criminal property relating to bank details, making a scanning device and possession of an identity document with improper intention. Sophisticated fraud: By placing cameras and skimming equipment on cashpoints they managed to get hold of the details of more than 60,000 bank customers and cloned cards with a value of £16m . Metac, 25, of  Harrow, pleaded guilty to having bank details on a computer, having counterfeit plastic cards, ATM card slots and a fake photo identity card. Turc, 27, pleaded guilty to having bank account details on a computer and two counts relating to the transfer or acquisition of money. Pop, 30, pleaded guilty to two counts of the transfer or acquisition of money. Following the sentencing, police said of more than 60,000 card details found, 36,000 of them belonged to people in the UK. Many of the cards found had the number of the stolen PIN written in black marker pen on the back for easy use by the criminals, a spokesman for the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit (DCPCU) said. The cards recovered had a street value of £16 million - based on the amount stolen on average from a compromised card, they said. As officers investigated this case, evidence of a method never seen before in the UK to steal card details came to light - spy cameras fitted to the side panel of cash machines, rather than the top panel. This method allowed fraudsters a better view of people's PIN numbers when the keypad is only partially covered by the customer's hand. Detective Inspector Sarah Ward, who led the investigation for the DCPCU, said: 'We are delighted that with these arrests and convictions we have been able to completely dismantle a criminal organisation that was stealing millions from people's bank accounts. 'The premises we raided really were a fraudster's utopia, with a dizzying array of machines and gadgets designed to commit serious fraud. 'These convictions send out a strong message to would-be fraudsters but there is also a word of caution for customers - always cover your PIN closely with your hand when using a cash machine to beat the criminals'. Virgil Spiridon, director of the organised crime department at the Romanian national police, added: 'Close co-operation between the DCPCU and our own officers played a key part in successfully securing these convictions. 'It was an excellent example of law enforcement agencies from different countries working together to ensure fraudsters' activities are brought to a halt and their crimes are punished.' Since the DCPCU was set up in April 2002, it has saved around £450 million by clamping down on fraud activity.","Fraudsters ran 'factory' where they cloned cards using stolen pin numbers .

According to the detail in the patent, the pen would consist of a 'base module', pictured, with a stylus tip for use with Apple's iPhone and iPads . Early iPen patents, dating back to May 2012, featured just a speaker and haptic feedback. This haptic feature would make the iPen vibrate as it moves around the screen, to tell a user they’ve performed a certain action. For example, if the stylus was used with a drawing program or app, the feedback would be designed to mimic a brush or pencil. A separate patent added orientation features in which the iPen would draw different lines depending on the angle it was being held at. This means users could change the thickness or style of a line, or make writing more closely resemble their own.

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . The woman arrested over the nursery investigation has been named locally as Nina Russell, the pre-school room leader . A woman has been arrested by police investigating a children's nursery. The Little Angels Nursery in Calne, Wiltshire, has been closed by Ofsted and staff from the nursery are currently informing all parents. A spokesperson for the nursery confirmed that all he knew was that it was not the owner of the nursery, Rachel Everitt, who had been arrested. He said police still had not told Ms Everitt who had been arrested or what they had been arrested in connection with. A letter outside the pre-school said inspectors had stepped in because of their belief 'that a child may be exposed to a risk of harm'. The notice on the door said the nursery - graded 'good' during an inspection in May - had been suspended from offering childcare pending an investigation. Worried parents were told to contact social services if they have any concerns. The letter said: 'The purpose of suspension is to allow time to investigate our belief that a child may be exposed to a risk of harm and for any necessary steps to be taken to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm. 'We will regularly review the situation and will stop the suspension within this period if we believe children are no longer at risk. 'Suspension does not automatically mean that a provider in unsuitable to provide care in the future or that we will cancel registration.' The spokesperson added that the nursery will reopen following the investigation. The woman has been named locally as Nina Russell, the pre-school room leader. She declined to comment on the on-going investigation. When asked if she was the 37-year-old woman arrested in connection with the investigation she, speaking with her husband Jonathan Russell, said: 'I cannot talk about it any further at this time.' An Ofsted spokesperson said: 'We have suspended this nursery's registration' Police said a 37-year-old woman was arrested on Saturday and taken to Melksham police station. She has since been released on police bail and investigations are continuing. Wiltshire Police would not confirm if the woman was a member of staff, or why she had been arrested. A police spokesman said: 'We can confirm that police are conducting an investigation into allegations relating to Little Angels Nursery in Calne. Fears: A letter outside the pre-school said inspectors had stepped in because of their belief 'that a child may be exposed to a risk of harm'.

"By . Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . James Alexander Gordon, the BBC broadcaster whose voice was synonymous with the classified football results on the radio, has died at the age of 78. The BBC announced that Gordon, who retired last year after more than forty years with the corporation and had been battling cancer, had died. Richard Burgess, the head of BBC sports news and BBC radio sport, described Gordon as 'a true gentleman', adding on Twitter: 'He will be greatly missed at BBC Sport.' Scroll down for video. Much missed: James Alexander Gordon - JAG - to his fans joined the BBC in 1972 and went on to become one of the most recognisable voices on radio, reading the football results first on Radio 2 and then Radio 5 Live . Gordon, popularly known by his initials as JAG, joined the BBC in 1972 and went on to become one of the most recognisable voices on radio, reading the results first on Radio 2 and then Radio 5 Live. His delivery made it possible to predict whether the result had been a home win, away win or draw simply from the inflection. He retired in July 2013 after having his larynx removed to treat throat cancer and was replaced by Charlotte Green. Fond tributes were quick to flood in following the announcement of his death, with Match of the Day host and former England striker Gary Lineker saying on Twitter: 'A voice we all know, the voice of the football results, James Alexander Gordon has died. Tottenham Hotspur 1.. Newcastle United 1.. #RIP.' Tributes have been paid to James Alexander Gordon who retired from the BBC in July 2013 . England goalkeeper Ben Foster tweeted: 'RIP James Alexander Gordon. Saturday afternoons checking Teletext and listening to the footy scores was The best.' BBC pundit and the former Wales international player Robbie Savage said 'Such sad news about James Alexander Gordon who has sadly passed away, what a fantastic man with a great voice. RIP James.' JAG's delivery made it possible to predict whether the result had been a home win, away win or draw simply from the inflection . Former England player Jimmy Armfield, a Radio 5 live colleague of Gordon, said: 'Five Live and the football results have lost a friend today. I can remember before I joined and he came to the BBC that the style was more regimented. He put a different slant on to it. He went up with the voice and down with the voice. 'He seemed to pitch it just right. He did it all with perfect enunciation. That lovely voice, with the little trace of Scots in it, with the highs and lows. He knew when to lift it and put it down. 'He really was something special. People used to mark the pools coupon with the football results. James knew that. He always gave them time to find out whether it was 1, 2 or an X for the football pools. 'It wasn't the same picture at all when he started out. There was no satellite broadcasting. Matches weren't shown as they are now. Everything came down the line on the radio. He was the first point of contact for who had won. James knew it all. He had it all weighed up. He was the consummate professional.' James Alexander Gordon was born at Edinburgh on February 10, 1936. He contracted polio as a child and spent much time in hospital, having to wear leg supports until his late teens. He joined the BBC as an announcer and newsreader after a career in music publishing. He began reading the results in 1974. He died at the Sue Ryder-Duchess of Kent Hospice in Reading, Berkshire, after a battle with cancer. He was survived by his wife Julia and son David.","JAG joined BBC in 1972 and read the results on Radio 2 then Radio 5 Live .

Dunn, from Dover in Kent, ran past the Spurs players and chipped the ball over the West Ham wall into the keeper's hands before being wrestled to the ground by Upton Park stewards. 'It was a boring game and I livened it up,' the West Ham fan said. 'The free kick I took was better than the professional one taken afterwards.' Scroll down for video . In trouble: This is the moment Jordan Dunn ran 80 yards across Upton Park to take a free kick during West Ham's game with Spurs on Saturday . Not bad: Dunn managed to dink the ball over the wall but the goalkeeper managed to stop it just under the crossbar . Confused: England winger Andros Townsend watches as the soon-to-be-banned fan rushed in and took the free kick . Speaking to The Sun, he added: 'These players are on thousands of pounds every week and I'm on £7 an hour yet I do a better job.' Yesterday he said a potential 10-year ban from all British football grounds because of the stunt is 'definitely worth it' because 'my mates think I'm a legend'. Despite his drunken state his effort was still better than star midfielder Christian Eriksen's, whose later attempt flew over the bar into the stands during Spurs' 1-0 win. The 22-year-old hotel receptionist spent Saturday night in a police cell before he was charged and bailed under the Football Offences Act. Dunn added that police officers were watching the incident online when he was taken to the station. He said he planned to plead guilty to the offence at Thames Magistrates' Court on September 1 where he faces a fine of up to £5,000 and a 10-year ban. But Dunn said: 'I know it was a mistake, but it was definitely worth it. 'My phone hasn't stopped going off and even Gary Lineker tweeted about it. My mates think I'm a legend. 'I could be looking at a 10-year-ban and even a £5,000 fine. The ban wouldn't bother me whatsoever but obviously the money would. 'My mum's not too happy, but she had a little laugh about it.' Lineker tweeted: 'A fan runs on the pitch at Upton Park and takes the free kick. Made a better fist of it than Eriksen.' On the run: The pitch invader, who had eight pints, then carried on sprinting as a steward followed him . Caught: It took four stewards to tackle him and Dunn says it was worth it because his mates think he is a 'legend' Right-footed Dunn, who plays for Dover Elms Vale, said he was forced to shoot with his left foot to avoid breaking his stride. His shot was saved by West Ham's Spanish goalkeeper Adrian. He added: 'I thought no one else was shooting, so I might as well. 'I think I ran about 80 yards. I don't remember looking at any players - I only had my eyes on the ball. 'If I had used my right I probably would have fallen over. It wasn't a bad strike though. 'I just wish I'd used the outside of my right foot and buried it bottom corner.'","Jordan Dunn drank five cans of lager before running onto pitch .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . As the height of summer approaches, many beachgoers may not realise that a hidden threat lies in the sand and water. Seagull droppings have been linked to rising levels of E.coli bacteria found on beaches, and to solve the problem a team of scientists have turned to an unusual source - border collies. Last summer, the dogs were employed to walk up and down the beaches in Michigan to chase the gulls away, and following tests, bacteria levels were found to have ‘significantly’ dropped. Seagull droppings have been linked to E.coli bacteria found in beach water. To reduce the risk to beachgoers, Michigan scientists are using patrol dogs. The border collies, pictured, walk up and down the beaches chasing gulls away and following tests, E.coli levels were found to have 'significantly' dropped . E. coli, also known as Escherichia coli, is the name of a germ, or bacterium, that lives in the digestive tracts of humans and animals. There are many types of E. coli, and most of them are harmless. But some can cause bloody diarrhoea, while others, in particular a strain called O157:H7, may also cause severe anaemia or kidney failure. There are also strains of E. coli that cause urinary tract infections. People can get an E. coli infection by coming into contact with the faeces of humans or animals. This can happen by drinking or eating contaminated food. Source: WebMD . Researchers from Central Michigan University reported the findings at the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology. Gull faeces was named as one source of the bacteria, which in recent years has led to beaches being closed and people advised not to swim. In addition, gull droppings may contain other bacteria that have the potential to cause human disease, according to researcher Elizabeth Alm. At the beginning of last summer, 656ft (200-metre) sections of beach were assigned to be either dog-treated beaches, or control beaches. Half way through the summer, the beach sections were swapped - so the dogs were moved to the control beaches and the previous ‘dog beaches’ were left untreated. During the summers of 2012 and 2013, researchers recorded the number of gulls at each beach section. During the dog tests, samples of beach water and beach sand were collected once a week, and the numbers of E. coli in the samples was counted. In . early summer, samples from beaches where dogs had been used to get rid . of the gulls had significantly lower E. coli counts compared to control . beaches. ‘Border collies are . intelligent dogs that love to work and could be used by beach managers . as part of a comprehensive management strategy to reduce bacterial . contamination at public beaches,’ said Alm.

"By . Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . Families who lost loved ones in the Marchioness pleasure boat tragedy will attend a memorial service this week to mark the 25th anniversary of the Thames disaster, which claimed 51 lives. On August 20, 1989 - a hot, late-summer evening - the riverboat Marchioness, packed with  partygoers, collided with the dredger Bowbelle near Cannon Street Railway Bridge and sank in the Thames. There were 131 people on Marchioness crewing, waiting and attending a private birthday party; fifty-one of them drowned. The names of the dead, including Francesca Dallaglio, 19, the sister of former England rugby captain Lawrence Dallaglio, will be read out at the service on at Southwark Cathedral in south London on Wednesday. The beached hull of Marchioness a river cruiser, which sunk after a collision with dredger Bowbelle on the Thames in the early hours of August 20 1989. The collision claimed 51 lives . One of the other victims was merchant banker Antonio de Vasconcellos, whose 26th birthday was being celebrated aboard the Marchioness. The service will be conducted by Southwark Cathedral Succentor the Rev Stephen Stavrou and later two launches will be provided to allow families to drop flowers at the spot on the river where the accident happened. Those attending the service will include some who have campaigned, through the Marchioness Action Group, for Thames safety improvements following the tragedy. Elsa Garcia, 25, was one of the 51 people who lost their lives when  Marchioness sank in 1989; Eileen Dallaglio holds a picture of her daughter Francesca, the youngest victim of the Marchioness disaster. Francesca was the sister of the England rugby captain Lawrence and her parents were awarded £34,000 in compensation for their loss . Emergency services gather at Waterloo Pier on the night of the disaster to rescue the survivors . A survivor of the disaster is met by relieved friends after being rescued from the disaster in August 1989 . These same bereaved families had to endure a 10-year wait for the announcement of a public inquiry into the disaster following an earlier 1991 report from the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB). That first report said the failure of both vessels to mount a proper look-out was the immediate cause of the tragedy. This was the same conclusion reached by Lord Justice Clarke when his 2001 report was published after the public inquiry, announced in 1999, was finally held. Marchioness sank causing the deaths of 51 people after it collided with a dredger on the Thames . A member of the RNLI drops a rose near the spot on the Thames where the Marchioness riverboat tragedy took place, to mark the 20th anniversary of the disaster . While the MAIB report said that there were marine regulation faults going back 25 years, the Clarke report said it was 'a catastrophe that should never have happened'. In the years between the two inquiries the families had to absorb the news that the Bowbelle captain, Douglas Henderson, was formally acquitted after juries at two separate trials failed to reach verdicts on a charge of his failing to keep a proper look-out. The skipper of Marchioness Stephen Faldo was among the dead. Friends and family member of those lost in the Marchioness riverboat tragedy stand on a boat near to where the accident took place, to mark the 20th anniversary of the disaster . The families also had to come to terms with the decision by Westminster Coroner Dr Paul Knapman to cut off the hands of more than 20 of the Marchioness victims for identification purposes - an action criticised in the Clarke report. The Clarke report was also critical of Captain Henderson, who had drunk six pints of lager in the afternoon before the tragedy. There was also criticism of the owners of both vessels. An inquest jury into the disaster returned a verdict of 'unlawful killing'. In July 1996 the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to justify any further criminal proceedings. After the Clarke report River Thames rules were tightened, including - in 2002 - the introduction of the first lifeboat services on the Thames.","Pleasure boat Marchioness collided with dredger Bowbelle causing deaths of 51 partygoers .

"By . Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . British Airways is used to flying VIPs around the world but a recent passenger was one of their more unusual. The 'World's Favourite Airline' flew a monkey more than 5,000 miles from the Maldives to start a new life in the UK. A Bengal Slow Loris, a small species of monkey no larger than a bag of sugar, was confiscated by police during a drugs raid in the capital Malé. Police kept Kalo in a birdcage on Dhoonidhoo for eight months, feeding it baby food and bananas. The police did not know what to do with the primate which is a nocturnal creature and kept it in a birdcage on Dhoonidhoo, also known as 'prison island', for eight months, feeding it baby food and bananas. They called him Kalo, which means 'buddy' and began searching for a home. His plight came to the attention of Dr Alison Cronin who runs the Ape Rescue Centre at Monkey World in Dorset. Other carriers refused to transport Kalo so Dr Cronin contacted the government and said that the monkey must come to the UK as an important conservation task. She said: 'It would have been a huge loss if a healthy, vulnerable animal had to be destroyed, but it was also really important for us to support the Maldivian authorities, and to send a message to other countries around the world that vulnerable creatures don't need to be put down – organisations like ours will provide support and assistance to ensure that endangered species aren't allowed to die off. 'I asked British Airways for its help in flying the VIP (very important primate) to the UK, and the airline responded immediately, because it has a history of supporting conservation projects.' Maldivian police called him Kalo, which means 'buddy' and began searching for a home . Captain Will Rennie flew the small primate from Malé to Gatwick. He said: 'Travelling at more than 500mph with us, our special little guest was for once not such a Slow Loris. The news that we had a VIP on board certainly created a buzz among customers in the cabin. We were very happy to offer a free ride – we knew this would be a different experience for our furry friend, so we made the journey as comfortable and cosy as possible.' South Malé Atoll in Velassaru, Maldives. Kalo was rescued from Malé during a drugs raid . Gabriella Tamasi, IAG Cargo's Global Product Manager responsible for live animal transportation, arranged for the Slow Loris to fly to the UK. Miss Tamasi said: 'This was an unprecedented operation from Malé Airport. The welfare of the animals we transport is our top priority, so we always adhere to IATA live animal regulations. Every detail had to be right – from the size of the container that the Loris was travelling in, to the way it was secured, and the temperature in the hold. We felt very strongly that with so few of these creatures in existence, this was something we had to help with.' The small monkey will spend the next four months in quarantine at Monkey World. It is then expected to begin a new life at the Shaldon Wildlife Trust in Devon, with a new friend, a Slow Loris called Doris, who has been without a companion since she arrived in the UK fifteen years ago.","Bengal Slow Loris is a species of monkey no bigger than a bag of sugar .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . Jeremy Bowen, one of the most familiar faces on the BBC's news programmes, said the issue of high pay had given the corporation's opponents 'sticks and stones to chuck at us' Bumper pay packets handed out to BBC executives have caused 'massive damage' to the corporation and created a 'them and us divide', according to its Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen. The journalist, one of the most familiar faces on the BBC’s news programmes, said the issue of high pay had given the corporation’s opponents 'sticks and stones to chuck at us'. Director-general Tony Hall introduced a cap on pay-offs of £150,000 when he took over following the furore over the £470,000 paid to his predecessor George Entwistle. Mr Entwistle was paid a year’s salary when he left the BBC’s top job - double what he was entitled to - even though he had only been in place for 54 days before resigning over his handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Bowen told the Guardian: 'The over-remuneration of people was a huge mistake and it’s caused massive damage to the BBC. 'It’s caused it internally, because the vast majority of people who work at the BBC do not get brilliantly paid. 'But . the massive salaries given to top management angered people on the shop . floor, exaggerated the ""them and us"" feeling that there was a . chauffeur-driven top of the corporation with enormous salaries and . massive bonuses. 'And that caused a lot of resentment and still does. I resented it personally.' Bowen, who joined the BBC as a trainee, . has covered conflicts in the Gulf, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya, . Somalia and Rwanda throughout his career. During the last financial year, the BBC paid out more than £25 million in severance payouts, including former Director General George Entwistle, who received £470,000 after he was forced to resign after Newsnight broadcast false allegations about Lord McAlpine. Other senior figures who walked away with huge sums include former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, who got £680,000, and deputy director general Mark Byford, who departed the BBC with a total payout of £949,000. In 2012 it emerged that the corporation had used more than £6million of licence-fee payers’ money to pay 14 executives more than £300,000 each. The figures reveal that redundancy payoffs almost doubled to £58million between 2010 and 2011. In 2010, 481 BBC staff received redundancy payments worth a total of £27million, while in 2011, 1,281 staff were handed payoffs totalling £58million.

In the first six months of 2012, 270 . staff members were given £14million. The average payout for departing . BBC workers was £51,000. It means that in total, the corporation paid £277million in redundancy to almost 6,000 staff in the seven years leading up to 2012. Four executives took more than £8.5million in payouts and pension deals with them between 2010 and 2012 alone. Former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, right, who got £680,000, and deputy director general Mark Byford, who was given a total payout of £949,000, were also given huge sums when they left the BBC . MPs were . left ‘incredulous’ when learning that former chief operating officer .

The . biggest payoff was awarded to Mark Byford, the former director of . journalism, who received £949,000 as compensation for loss of office, . while an unnamed finance officer was given a £420,000 payoff. George Entwistle quit in November 2012 after only 54 days in charge. But on top of his well-publicised £450,000 pay-off – double that to which he was entitled – his lavish exit package included another £45,000 for bills for lawyers and communications advisers. The deal included up to £10,000 for the legal advice to help him secure his pay-off and £1,200 per year for a Bupa policy. Caroline Thomson left the BBC in 2012, having spent more than 23 years at the company. She walked away with a pension pot . worth more than £1.7million, having been on an annual salary of . £330,000. It later emerged that she left with a payout of £670,000 - . more than two years' salary. This included a year's salary for making her role redundant and the payment of her 12-month notice period. Mark Byford, the former deputy director general, left the BBC in 2011 after 32 years and was given a severance package of almost £1million. As with Miss Thomson, this was made up of his notice period and redundancy payment. He also left with a huge pension pot, thought to be worth in the region of £3.5million. Sharon .

After realising Darren is stuck, one of his friends tries to haul him out of the chair by grabbing him under the arms - while another pulls on the wooden tray attached. When that doesn't work the two men tilt the chair towards the ground - as Darren groans in pain - hoping that the new angle might make it easier to pull him free. His friends burst into laughter when Darren once again can't get out and continue laughing as he starts wriggling desperately in his chair - his face becoming increasingly panicked. A third friend gets involved in the rescue mission as they try once more to pull Darren out, but they all step back when nothing can be done. Darren is seen shuffling around the floor while pushing the chair away from his body before leaning forwards on all fours - the chair resting around his waist.

Professor Sir Mike Richards, the chief inspector of hospitals, said some NHS trusts had failed to learn from more successful ones for what ‘sometimes seems like decades’. Although there were many examples of outstanding NHS care in challenging circumstances, a few hospitals still deny they had problems and resist efforts to help them improve, he claimed.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Second World War rescue dog credited with saving more than 100 lives is among a new 'Hall of Heroes' celebrating little-known heroic figures throughout history. Rip, who searched for people buried in the rubble after bombing raids during the Blitz, is just one character included in the new collection aimed at celebrating everyone from unsung underdogs to wartime heroes. Family history website Findmypast wants people to share stories about their own heroic family figures to help create the 'Hall of Heroes'. The site is to donate £10 to the British Red Cross for every real-life story published. Second World War rescue dog Rip, pictured here with his handler, is being celebrated as part of a project to remember little-known heroic figures throughout history . To mark the launch of its campaign, the site is releasing four new sets of records to help people find out more about their own family heroes - Victoria Cross (VC) Recipients 1854-2006; the Royal Navy 1914 Star Medal Roll 1914-1920; the Marriage Registers of the British Royal Marines 1813-1920; and the Falklands War British Deaths 1982. The VC collection includes the 1,349 people awarded the highest military honour for valour, given to heroes from conflicts including the Crimean War, the Boer War and both world wars. Rip, who was originally found in Poplar, London, in 1940 by an air raid warden, was awarded the Dickin Medal for bravery in 1945, and died in 1946. The Hall of Heroes will also include Dorothea Crewdson, one of 38,000 Voluntary Aid Detachment nurses who went overseas to care for injured servicemen during the First World War. Captain Noel Godfrey Chavasse is also being remembered in the collection . The collection will also remember some of the well-decorated figures from the First World War, such as Captain Noel Godfrey Chavasse, one of three people ever to have won the Victoria Cross twice, and the only person to be awarded both the Victoria Cross and bar during the First World War. The 'father of plastic surgery' Sir Harold Gillies, who earned his nickname because of his pioneering work in facial repairs and reconstructive medical advances during the First World War will also be remembered. Holly Thomas, historian and writer at Findmypast, said: 'It's great to be able to celebrate the bravery and courage of figures in our history. 'The 'Hall of Heroes' allows the lives of well-documented famous figures to be recognised alongside the bravery of the everyman, including maids, miners and even rescue dogs. 'These people, drawn from all walks of life, and from all over the world, played an incredibly important part in shaping our history.

By chance, an off-duty military explosive expert was also on the seafront at Dovercourt, near Harwich, Essex, and recognised what the barnacle-covered 'stone' actually was. Police put up a cordon while they waited for a bomb disposal team to deal with the find. Wartime grenades similar to those that have washed up on the seafront at Dovercourt, near Harwich, Essex . It is the fifth Second World War grenade to wash up on the same beach over the last five weeks. Twenty four hours before yesterday's discovery another grenade was discovered less than a quarter of a mile away. Inspector Paul Butcher of Essex police said anyone who finds a grenade should call police immediately and stay well clear of the explosive.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Rail commuters can expect the price of some tickets to rise by as much as 5.6 per cent next year. Campaigners say fares are rising four times faster than wages and that the system used to calculate price increases is ‘discredited’. The January 2015 rise for regulated fares, which include season tickets, will be based on the RPI inflation figure for July 2014 which is published on Tuesday. Feeling the pinch: Commuters at London's Waterloo station. Some fares will rise by as much as 5.6 per cent . The price-rise formula is RPI plus 1 per cent, which would mean average fares going up 3.6 per cent if RPI remains at its June 2014 level of 2.6 per cent. But there is also a ‘flex’ rule that allows train companies to raise some regulated fares by a further 2 per cent as long as the overall average remains at the RPI plus 1 per cent level. This means some fares could rise by around 5.6 per cent in the new year. In his 2013 autumn statement, Chancellor George Osborne pegged the regulated-fare rise equal to RPI while reducing the ‘flex’ rule from 5 per cent to 2 per cent. He will now face pressure to make a similar announcement in his statement this year. The Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) said fares had gone up 20.4 per cent over the lifetime of this Parliament, with the increase likely to be around 24.7 per cent when the January 2015 rise takes effect. That compared to wages rising at 6.9 per cent over the past four years, said the CBT, with the cost of commuting now taking up as much as a fifth of some passengers’ annual salaries. It said: ‘Fare changes are determined by a discredited measurement. The RPI is deemed to over-estimate inflation. Hard winter: Fares will go up again in the first week of January. The Campaign for Better Transport said: 'Fare changes are determined by a discredited measurement. The RPI is deemed to over-estimate inflation' ‘Our research has shown that the Government’s practice of linking regulated fares to RPI rather than the more accurate CPI measure has cost commuters hundreds of pounds over the last decade. It added: 'Many commuters live in marginal constituencies, where MPs should be aware that unsustainable fare increases during this Parliament could persuade people to vote for change in May’s general election.' Unions forming the TUC’s campaign group Action for Rail will be holding demonstrations at rail stations across the country on Tuesday. Mick Cash, acting general secretary of the RMT transport union, said passengers were 'being lined up for an inflation-busting increase in their fares'. The RMT is angered that the Northern Rail company has axed some off-peak early-evening tickets on some routes. Mr Cash said: 'You can bet your life that other train companies will seize on the move by Northern Rail to abolish off-peak fares, clobbering the travelling public with a double whammy that will hit them hard in the pocket while the train companies are laughing all the way to the bank.' A Department of Transport spokesperson said: 'No decisions on fare rises for 2015 have yet been taken. 'We understand people’s concerns about the cost of travel and the impact this has on family budgets. That is why for 2014 we reduced average fare rises to RPI plus 0 per cent for the first time in a decade.'","Campaigners say rail fares are rising four times faster than wages .
Price rise formula is supposed to be RPI inflation value plus 1% .
But 'flex' rule allows some regulated fares to be raised much higher ."
"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . Zuleika Henderson, 38, taking part in the ice bucket challenge in front of Big Ben in London . The ice bucket challenge is the latest craze to sweep the United States – and now it seems the cold water trend has hit the UK. It involves people pouring a freezing cold bucket of water over their heads to raise money for charity before nominating other people to get involved. The trend started in America where people wanted to raise awareness of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) – also referred to as motor neurone disease. It went viral after Pete Frates, a former Boston College baseball player tipped to become a Red Sox star who had his career cut short by the disease, nominated fellow Boston athletes to take part. This then spread to celebrities including Mark Zuckerberg, Justin Timberlake and even Bill Gates. Now the phenomenon has landed in the UK with people across the country gearing up to the challenge - and supporting the UK's version of the charity - the MND Association. Zuleika Henderson, 38, from Crystal Palace in London decided to do her ice bucket challenge in front of iconic clock tower, Big Ben. She said: ‘I was challenged by a friend of mine from the New York police department who also challenged others from Canada, South Africa and Australia so I felt the need to do something special for London. 'It was of course, utterly freezing, and very confusing for some of the tourists there to see Big Ben - I'm sure I'll be in a few of their holiday photos!' The communications manager added: 'I think a few minutes of icy pain isn't much if it raises awareness and donations for people who face a disease every day. I didn't know what ALS was before the challenge, so it worked in my case, I think the ice bucket challenge is doing a lot of good.' Others have been taking part but using the opportunity to donate to different charities. Macmillan Cancer Support has also received thousands of donations after it asked people to use the hashtag #icebucketchallenge to share their videos on social media. The youngest challenger so far, six-year-old Ianto, was filmed taking part in the challenge by his father Shaun Gustard, who shared it on Facebook. He was spared the ice cubes but managed to pour the cold water over his head in support of his mother who is battling cancer and recently had lymph nodes removed. Scroll down for video .

And the world's second richest man gladly accepted the challenge, using his own device to drench himself . Mr Gustard told Macmillan Cancer Support: ‘He’s a really sensitive kid and when he went to see her [his mother] after surgery he was very upset – it really knocked him for six. ‘Ianto is naturally very kind and caring, so when he saw me do an ice bucket challenge the day after he’d been to see her, he asked if he could do one too, for his mum. I thought it was a bit mean to put ice in the bucket so we used cold water. ‘Macmillan have been a huge source of support to Jane so we’re really proud of him and hope he’s made a difference.’ Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher has also taken part in the ice bucket challenge and pledged his support in aid of the James McCarthy Foundation. The Manchester United midfielder was only too happy to receive two buckets of ice cold water over his head, dedicating it to James McCarthy, a young man from Manchester who has suffered with illness ever since a car crash in 2009. He has now challenged former Manchester United duo Cristiano Ronaldo and Wes Brown as the next personnel to take part in the craze. Shamless star Emmy Rossum (left) and Chloe Moretz (right)  drew attention to the ice bucket challenge . Syd Butler and Seth Meyers dump a bucket of ice on actor Mickey Rourke live on Late Night with Seth Meyers . Both Paul Scholes and Gary Neville had already undertaken the challenge after the Class of 92 match which took place last week. The only well-known figure to decline the challenge so far has been President Obama, who chose to donate $100 to the ALS Association instead. Comedian Ricky Gervais also uploaded his ice bucket challenge to his Facebook page today. The phenomenon has raised nearly $3 million for the ALS Association – which is 50 per cent more than they raised last year.

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . Frustrated drivers have been slammed by the police for risking lives when they turned around on a motorway and drove the wrong way up a slip road to avoid lengthy tailbacks. Motorists were caught on camera spinning their vehicles around and exiting the M67 via the entry slip road after a three-car smash near junction 2, not far from Denton, Greater Manchester. But drivers who turned around said their actions were pure 'common sense', while those who could not said they were jealous. Scroll down for video . Turning back: Drivers drive the wrong way up the M67 motorway slip road after a crash . Police officers, firefighters and paramedics helped rescue motorists involved in the crash . People looked on in amazement from a footbridge as cars began to turn around and drive up the slip road . Property investor Mike Stenhouse was one of the last cars to escape the wrong way up the slip road before police intervened. He said: 'We were one of the last people to get off that way. Luckily we were right by the slip road when the traffic stopped. 'God, it saved us a lot of time. People who were less lucky were stuck there for hours. 'We were very relieved. It was a pack mentality but it got us out.' Martin McDonnell was driving along the M67 with his brother at the time of the crash and was less lucky. He said: 'I wouldn't have minded that at all. It would've been very nice to have got out of there early. I don't blame them.' Peter Belsten witnessed the chaotic scenes from a footbridge and told the Manchester Evening News: 'Once one started, they all turned around in the motorway and headed up the on ramp. 'It was bizarre, complete mayhem, loads of bumps and irate drivers.' A pedestrian could also be seen walking up the on ramp at Junction 1A as cars and vans weaved around the gridlocked traffic. Traffic officers eventually brought the free-for-all to an end by blocking the slip road. Martin McDonnell was among hundreds of drivers stuck in the tailbacks for more than two hours . Three cars were involved in the crash near junction 2, not far from Denton, Greater Manchester . Luckily nobody was seriously injured in the crash, but the tailbacks caused chaos for commuters . Paul Watters, head of public affairs at the AA, said he could 'see the thought process' of the drivers who turned around, but drivers should wait for instruction from the police. He said: 'I have sympathy with the drivers. You can understand the frustrations of people stuck in these situations. They probably thought they were doing the right thing. 'I can see their thought process, but I cannot encourage people to turn around on the motorway. 'There could have been a motorbike zipping down the slip road, or another emergency vehicle trying to attend the crash. 'What the police don't need in these incidents is chaos upon chaos, so the right thing to do is wait for instruction from them.' The Highways Agency condemned the drivers' actions and said nobody should ever drive in the wrong direction unless directed to do so. The offence is punishable by three penalty points and a fine. A spokesman said: 'I appreciate that when there is an accident people want to try to get to where they are going, but it doesn't help anybody if people take it upon themselves to turn around and drive the wrong way up a motorway. 'We do have a system of releasing traffic if it has been there for a while, where vehicles will be properly directed and it is done in a safe and controlled manner, whereas people turning round of their own accord and not under direction probably isn't. 'If somebody turns and drives the wrong way down the road and has a secondary accident that means we then have to deal with that too and the road is closed for longer for everybody else.' Nobody was seriously injured in the crash. Paul Watters, from the AA, said he 'understood the thought process' of drivers who turned around after the crash, but said he would not encourage doing it himself . Turning around on the motorway can earn drivers three points on their licence and a fine .","Dozens of motorists turn around on motorway and drive up slip road after smash blocked M67 for hours .

"By . Dan Bloom . With nine bedrooms, six bathrooms and a perfect view of Salisbury Cathedral, it can't have been a bad place to hide from the plague. Now the mansion Charles II called home in 1665 after fleeing disease-ridden London is on the open market for the first time in its 600-year history - and if you have £5million lying around, it could be yours. Grade I listed Malmesbury House is in Cathedral Close in Salisbury, Wiltshire, one of the most exclusive British streets outside London whose residents have included former Prime Minister Ted Heath. Rumour had it King Charles would address the people of Salisbury from the safety of the projecting oriel window, while the great composer George Frideric Handel gave his first English performance in the mansion's music room. The house was bought by the Harris family, a wealthy dynasty of politicians and diplomats, in 1660 and kept in their ownership for more than 300 years. Over the centuries they shaped the way it looks today - including commissioning an extension by Sir Christopher Wren, who designed St Paul's Cathedral. The current owners, George and Jayne Apter, bought the home in 2006 from the wife of Conservative MP John Cordle, who had passed away two years earlier. Charlie Stone, from Savills, said: 'Owing to its rarity and historical connections, we expect strong interest.' Princely: Malmesbury House, which Charles II called home for about a year in 1665 after fleeing plague-ridden London, is on the open market for the first time in its 600-year history - and could be yours for £5 million. The main house, spread across 7,638 sq ft, has a reception hall, drawing room, study and library . Country pile: The home was built in 1416 and, during the Civil War, was the home of Sir George Vaughan, the High Sheriff of Wiltshire who lived there while raising an army to support Charles I. In 1660 it was taken on by the wealthy Harris family, which shaped it into the house it is today including an extension by Sir Christopher Wren . Repairs: The current owners, George and Jayne Apter, bought Malmesbury House in 2006 from the wife of Conservative MP John Cordle, who had passed away two years earlier. At the time it had a leaking roof and several rooms were unlived in so English Heritage stepped in to help pay for the extensive restoration . History: It was in the mansion's music room that legendary composer Handel, a friend of the owner James Harris, is thought to have made his first English performance . Safe from plague: The oriel window (left) where Charles II (right) addressed his subjects as he hid from the plague that was sweeping uncontrollably across London. The next year, in 1666, the plague would be largely decimated by the Great Fire of London which, although it destroyed much of the city's history, claimed very few lives . Charlie Stone, from Savills, said: 'The Cathedral Close is one of the most desirable places to live in outside London. It is an urban setting, but it is the best of both worlds. It is country and town in one setting. I have sold a number of homes in the close, but the architectural quality of Malmesbury House's interior is exceptional' Escape to the country: King Charles II fled London to escape the plague . When Charles II fled to the house in 1665, he was only doing what thousands of poverty-stricken Londoners would have loved to do. The capital's slums were never free of the disease, but a hot summer in 1665 coupled with a sharp boost in population saw residents leaving more and more rubbish out in the streets. Huge red blotches on the skin - perhaps better known as a 'ring-a-ring of roses' - would be the first sign of a fatal condition which spread like wildfire among the cramped conditions of the city's poor. By coincidence, wildfire was exactly what did spread the next September when a bakery in the ancient timber-built city of London caught alight, sparking the Great Fire of London which raged for days. Catastrophic though it was, it helped wipe out the plague. By the time it broke out Charles II had already returned to London from Salisbury in February 1666. After things were made safe, he travelled to address the 100,000 made homeless and declared the fire had been an act of God. It was not the first time Charles II avoided disaster raging all around him. He escaped England during the Civil War in 1651 and remained in exile until the monarchy was restored almost a decade later. In one incident during the Battle of Worcester, he and a colonel managed to evade angry parliamentarians by hiding all day inside a hollow oak tree at Boscobel House. It was since renamed the Royal Oak - as are countless pubs. Domestic bliss: The kitchen is big enough to whip up a Baroque-era banquet. The house's price-tag is down to its location, size, architecture and history . Dream job for a gardener: The grounds, while not as large as in some country piles due to its urban location are still enough to play a good game of football... or croquet. Handel was a friend of James Harris III and the house is named after James Harris IV, who became the 1st Earl of Malmesbury in recognition of his diplomatic career .","Grade I listed Malmesbury House in Salisbury, Wiltshire, was built in 1416 and has never been sold on the open market .

"By . Sam Webb . and Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . This is the moment a hapless sailor was rescued five miles off the coast of Dorset last night - after attempting to sail 3,000 miles to America in a 14ft dinghy. The 30-year-old Bulgarian national purchased the £300 boat from Christchurch harbour yesterday before setting off on his voyage. He was spotted looking seasick in choppy seas at around 5pm by a passing yachtsman, who called the coastguard. An RNLI lifeboat crew from Mudeford was called to help the man, who had a U.S. visa on board, but he refused their assistance for 45 minutes. Scroll down for video .

The man was spotted looking seasick in chopping seas by a passing yachtsman, who called the coastguard to come and help . Despite his reluctance, the sailor was dragged onto the RNLI lifeboat. Crew said he was suffering the first signs of hypothermia . He was eventually dragged onto the RNLI lifeboat and taken to shore, where police and an ambulance crew were waiting. He has since been released from hospital and is staying with a well-wisher. He also returned to the station to meet staff, where he was told not to attempt his journey again. When he was found, yhe man was not wearing a life jacket, his boat did not have any lights and the only navigational aid in his possession was a street map of Southampton. He had packed himself a bag of food, consisting of baked beans, hotdogs and biscuits, as well as a bag of clothes. Pete Dadds, 41, a lifeboat crewman who attended the incident, said the man would have died if he had not been rescued. 'When we reached the gentleman he didn't want us there, he wanted to carry on his way,' the commercial fisherman said. 'We were not happy leaving him out there. He kept saying 'I am going west'. 'His boat was not properly rigged so he was just getting battered, he was at the mercy of the elements. The 30-year-old was taken to shore, where police and an ambulance crew were waiting. He was taken to A&E . The man had been violently sick when he boarded the RNLI lifeboat. He has seen been given accommodation by a 'well-wisher' 'We said ""if we leave you you will die"". He didn't have a life-jacket, just a buoyancy aid and the vessel didn't . have any lights.' He added: 'All he had on was a bag of personal belongings which were a few odds and ends, a bag of biscuits, beans and hot dogs and a bag with his passport in. 'He was . obviously suffering from the first signs of hypothermia. He was only . wearing a pack-a-mac jacket and leggings. He was absolutely sodden.' The man boarded the RNLI lifeboat, where he was violently sea sick and 'very, very cold', Mr Dadds added. 'I ended up cuddling him at the back of the boat to keep him warm,' he said. 'He would have died, he was severely sea sick, he had the first signs of hypothermia and his boat was filling up with water. The sailor made it five miles from . Christchurch harbour, pictured above - 3,000 shy of America . The man was trying to sail to America in a £300 14ft . dinghy with no lights, no life jacket and rudimentary supplies (file picture) 'There's no chance it would have kept going for much longer.' Mr Dadds said the sailor was 'incredibly lucky' the yacht had been passing him and had contacted the coastguard. The RNLI crew arrived back at Mudeford at around 6.30pm and the man was immediately taken to hospital by the waiting ambulance. His boat was then towed back to shore by the crew. The sailor was rescued five miles off the coast of Dorset after buying a dinghy from Christchurch . Richard Stride, lifeboat operations manager at Mudeford, told MailOnline that the sailor had been discharged from hospital and had since been given accommodation by a well-wisher. He said the man had been back to the station where he had a long chat with one of the staff. He said: 'He was telling the man how inadvisable it would be for him to attempt to do it again. So hopefully he won't try it. 'I know from those that have spoken to him that he did not just set off for America. I think what he was trying to do is go westwards and then find someone who could take him the whole way.'","The 30-year-old was spotted looking seasick in rough seas in £300 boat .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . A farmer left skeletons belonging to sheep, pigs and lambs rotting in wheelie bins, trailers and animals pens on his land. Albert Nelson, 76, discarded raw meat and bones in the sheep pen, while sheep carcasses were left to decompose under blankets and metal sheets in the yard. Inspectors also found a makeshift stable containing the carcass of a horned sheep, . the face of which had been eaten away. They also found a trailer full of bones, . skeletons and black binbags at the farm in Broughton, Lancashire. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Albert Nelson, 76, a farmer from Broughton, Lancashire, left rotting carcasses lying around his farm in wheelie bins, trailers and animals pens . Nelson, who owns the farm, was prosecuted under laws designed to prevent disease outbreaks such as foot-and-mouth and BSE. By failing to dispose of the animal carcasses, he risked sparking a serious outbreak of disease, the court was told. Nick McNamara, prosecuting for Lancashire Trading Standards, told Preston Magistrates Court that the first inspection was in March 2013. He said: 'The circumstances go back to March 20, 2013, when animal health officers, responding to a complaint, attended the defendants farm at Broughton. 'The purpose of the officers’ visit was to inspect the proper disposal of  livestock carcasses and, having first introduced themselves to Mr Nelson, they set about an inspection of farm buildings in a yard near the farmhouse. 'The first building they entered is described as a pig building where they found three sheep and a lamb. The bones and skeletons were from sheep, pigs and lambs. Some had rotted right down to the bone, pictured left, while some were merely covered up with sheets, pictured right . Inspectors found a makeshift stable containing the carcass of a horned sheep, the face of which had been eaten away . 'At the back of the pig building was an area containing two large sows, in front of which were piled crates and plastic bags containing scraps of pink meat. 'Outside the pig building, in the farmyard, were piled tins of an Indian vegetable-type food product bearing an expired best-before date. 'And in the boot of a nearby pick-up were found bags of unlabelled dry feed.' Nelson, described as a 'small-scale keeper of livestock' including sheep, cattle and pigs, was unable to produce records of where he bought the products. Inspectors were so shocked with what they found that the first inspection was stopped, while specialists were called in to deal with the animal remains . Officers were so concerned the inspection was suspended to call in specialists from the Animal Health Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA). It was during that inspection, following the arrival of two vets, that even more carcasses were found. Nelson was issued with an immediate standstill notice to stop him moving any live animals off or onto the farm. He was also issued with an animal-by products notice, requiring the immediate removal of the carcasses. Nelson was prosecuted under laws which are designed to stop the outbreak of disease, such as foot-and-mouth and BSE. The court heard the carcasses posed 'a real and obvious risk' to the environment . Two further visits took place six days later and on April 9, 18 and 26 where inspectors found more animal skeletons. Mr McNamara added: 'Rotting carcasses pose a real and obvious risk to the environment. 'Clearly, many of the carcasses found on Mr Nelson’s land had been there for some length of time, given their severely decomposed condition. 'And it stands to reason that somebody on the farm knew there were carcasses about, given some of the crude attempts to conceal them beneath rubbish, in bags and, in the case of two animals, in wheelie bins.' Nelson admitted seven contraventions of disease control measures. The court heard the offences happened when he was suffering from ill health . Nelson admitted seven contraventions of disease control measures. Defending, Angela Rossi said the offences happened at a time when the farmer was suffering from ill health. She said: 'Six months earlier DEFRA had visited and said everything was ok and so something has got out of hand in a short space of time.' The chairman of the magistrates bench said: 'There was a very real and obvious risk to the environment and disregard to other animals and a serious risk to land and water' He will be sentenced on September 3.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

The alleged lover of a Marine's missing pregnant wife has been arrested in Alaska after her body was found at the bottom of an abandoned mine shaft in Southern California. Christopher Brandon Lee, 24, was arrested on Sunday night in Anchorage on suspicion of killing Erin Corwin. Lee, a married father-of-one and former Marine, is being held on a federal hold and will be extradited to California. Authorities say Lee's wife, Nichole Lee, is a 'person of interest' in the death. Corwin's body was found on Saturday afternoon at the bottom of a 140-foot-deep mine shaft several miles away from Twentynine Palms Marine Base in California, where she lived.The exact location is not known. Her remains were identified on Sunday through dental records. Corwin's death was ruled a homicide following an autopsy on Monday. The 20-year-old was newly pregnant when she went missing on June 28. She told her Marine husband Jonathan Corwin she was headed to Joshua Tree National Park, but never returned home. Her Toyota Corolla was found two days later abandoned just blocks from the Twentynine Palms Marine Base. Search and rescue teams scoured a 300-square-miles are around Joshua Tree National Park, including more than 100 mine shafts, for nearly two months before Corwin's body was found. The investigation grew to focus on Lee, who was the Corwins' neighbor at the Marine Base, according to court papers. Erin Corwin's friend told investigators that Corwin and Lee were having an affair and that the unborn child might be Lee's, the papers show. Scroll down for video . Erin and Jonathan Corwin .

But . the friend showed authorities text messages that said Corwin was . planning to go on a special hunting trip with Lee the day she . disappeared to celebrate. 'It is highly likely that Erin could have been harmed by an unknown firearm,' investigators wrote in the documents. 'Sometime . after Erin left with Lee, her phone was deactivated (turned off). Detectives believe if Erin was injured and left at an undisclosed . location, she would not (be) able to call for help.' Scene .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Forget generic greetings and winter landscapes, one interfaith couple has found a clever way to mark their separate religious beliefs in one colorful holiday card. San Francisco's Scott Burry and Dani Vernon have combined the traditions of their respective Christian and Jewish faiths which has delighted their friends and family. 'We wanted to do something fun and something light, and we hadn't done anything like this together before,' Burry, 27, told MailOnline. 'The card is less . about the ceremonial aspects and more...about how can we celebrate together as a family. The card is about where we come from.' Merry Chrismukkah! Interfaith couple Scott Burry and Dani Vernon combined their holiday traditions in one greeting card . On the left side of the inclusive card, Burry stands in front of a fake Christmas tree and a mountain of presents holding the couple's beloved pooch, Tucker. To his right stands Vernon, 27, with a Star of David and the Chanukkah candles against a blue background. Although the 'Chrismukkah' card is split down the middle, the couple insist they share each other's religious traditions. 'I don't know that we were trying to make a statement,' Burry said. 'Dani's family is this large Jewish . family and I have assimilated into that for the last four years. And we . also celebrate Christmas together. We all share our faith.' Team effort: The couple decked out a studio at Left Space photography studios in San Francisco for the shoot using a few cheap props, wallpaper and a fake Christmas tree . Hair and makeup: The pair were perfectly coiffed for the creative shoot in San Francisco . Burry said a group of friends helped him and Vernon set up the shoot at Left Space studios in San Francisco last month. They bought some cheap decorations and bright wallpaper to deck out the bare studio, holiday-style. The couple, who have been dating for about four years, sent the card out to family and friends just before Hanukkah ended on December 5. They loved it.

"By . Emily Crane . The teenager who fought back against years of bullying when he slammed his tormentor into the ground at a western Sydney high school three years ago said the 40 second viral video has changed his life. Footage of Casey Heynes lifting a 12-year-old above his head and flooring him at Chifley College in Mount Druitt, west of Sydney, in 2011 reached hundreds of millions of people across the world.

Casey Heynes made international headlines when he floored a 12-year-old bully at his western Sydney high school in 2011 . 'There was a girl on Facebook who wrote and told me I saved her on that day. She had decided to kill herself that day and when she heard my story she didn't do it,' Casey told ninemsn. 'That really stopped me. It made me feel proud of myself and proud that I could help her. But I feel sad too. There are a lot of people like that. They tell me I helped them but I don't know them and I don't know their full story.' Casey said he was still trying to deal with his long-lasting fame after the 40 second mobile phone footage went viral.

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A man accused of shooting dead three people and ordering the killing of a fourth is fighting the death penalty - as he asks for permission to marry in jail instead. Kenneth 'Cody' Rackemann, 24, has asked an Indiana judge to reconsider his bid to marry his fiancée, Tia Brasfield, after the request was denied in April. The request cites a federal court ruling . that says 'it is unconstitutional for a jail to prohibit the defendant . from getting married for any reason not related to a legitimate . penological interest', the IndyStar reported. Request: Cody Rackemann, left, has asked for permission to marry Tia Brasfield, right. Before his arrest, he had 'T 100' tattooed on his forehead - a reference to a name he and his associates used for their group . It comes as Rackemann's attorneys claim that prosecutors' request for the death penalty, which was filed in Marion Superior Court in July, violate the man's constitutional rights. Rackemann, who formerly worked in security for a drug dealer, is being held in Marion County Jail, Indiana, accused in the killing of the dealer and three associates at a house in Indianapolis. He is one of four people charged with the deaths of Walter 'Buddy' Burnell, 47, Jacob Rodemich, 43, Kristy Sanchez, 22, and Hayley Navarro, 21, during the house robbery in February. One of the defendants, Samantha Bradley, pleaded guilty earlier this month to a conspiracy charge and agreed to testify against the other defendants in exchange for dropping the other charges. Support: Brasfield, left, has shared this picture giving her support to Rackemann on her Facebook page . Prosecutors say Rackemann shot  Burnell - the drug dealer - Rodemich and Sanchez and directed another defendant, Valencia Williams, 21, to kill Navarro. Just hours before he was arrested two days after the bodies were found, Rackemann went to a tattoo parlor and he and a fellow defendant, Anthony LaRussa, 26, received matching tattoos. They were both inked with 'Sweet Dreams' on their eyelids and both received 'T 100' on their foreheads, referring to Team 100, a name they gave themselves, Fox59 reported. The tattoos are visible in Rackemann's mug shots. Rackemann's . fiancee, Tia Brasfield, expresses her support for her husband-to-be on . her Facebook page, and has uploaded a photo collage of her and her . boyfriend with the caption: 'Free my baby.' Killed: Walter Burnell, a drug dealer who lived at the home, and Jacob Rodemich were shot dead in the robbery, Rackemann, who had previously worked in security for Burnell, is accused of shooting dead both men . Victims: He also allegedly shot Kristy Sanchez, left, and ordered another suspect to kill Hayley Navarra, right . Scene: The four bodies were found inside Burnell's Indianapolis home, pictured, in February . The mother-of-two has also previously defended him to the press. 'Cody doesn't have the heart to kill anybody like that,' she told ABC6. 'That's not him. He's not capable of that.' Rackemann faces four counts of murder, four counts of felony murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery, while LaRussa faces four counts of felony murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. Another defendant, Valencia Williams, who allegedly shot the fourth victim, faces one count of murder, four counts of felony murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery.","Kenneth 'Cody' Rackemann has asked for a judge's permission to marry his fiancee after their request was denied in April .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . Caught: Jonathan Phan allegedly broke into a woman's home and climbed into bed with her . An actor has been arrested after he allegedly broke into a California woman's home during the night, removed all of his clothes apart from his underwear and got into her bed as she slept. Jonathan Phan, a Vietnamese actor and stuntman who has appeared in a handful of TV shows and movies, then fell asleep in the woman's bed, police said. The woman awoke to find Phan beside her and started screaming - waking him up and forcing him to jump out the window without his pants, wallet or cell phone. She alerted authorities in Santa Ana, California and they were able to identify him by the California driver's license Phan had left at the woman's home, authorities said. Speaking to KCAL9, the woman, who wished to remain unidentified, said she woke up to find the man still asleep during the July incident. 'I wake up at 8 in the morning, but he's still asleep. Then I yell,' she said. 'I said, ""Who are you?"" Then he [wakes] up [and says], ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry'.' Authorities arrested Phan on Friday but they did not announce a motive. They believe he entered the home after cutting through a screen and climbing through a window. Police said detectives don't believe that Phan knew the woman or had any ties to the home. Starring role: Phan appeared in a movie out this year called 'Battle B-Boy', in which gangs use breakdancing to battle each other. The 29-year-old Vietnamese actor also has a smattering of TV and Shorts credits . The homeowner, whose teenage daughter was also asleep inside the house at the time, told CBS LA that she is now afraid to sleep in her own bed. Phan now faces a charge of residential burglary and was being held on $50,000 bail, according to inmate records. Phan, who also goes by Jae Phan, has a few movie and TV credits to his name, including the lead role in a movie out this year, Battle B-Boy, in which gangs use break dancing to battle for money. YouTube videos also show him presenting Vietnamese entertainment shows. Scene: He was allegedly found sleeping in just his underwear at this home in Santa Ana, and fled when the homeowner awoke and screamed. She said she is now scared to be in the home . Orange County Superior Court records show Phan previously pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor DUI count in 2012, and misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance and being under the influence of a controlled substance in 2013, the OC Register reported. In this most recent case, he is due to appear in court on Tuesday.","Jonathan Phan 'broke into a California home in July, took off his clothes and climbed into a woman's bed'

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . Fed up of sickly sweet flavoured ice creams? Well, you're in luck because the UK’s first savoury ice cream parlour opens in London this week and aims to offer a gourmet experience for those who like their summer snacks a little less ‘vanilla’. The pop-up promises to combine the UK’s favourite summer treat with a savoury twist - think blue cheese, cream cracker, ale and twiglet flavoured ice cream. Sick of the sweet stuff? A new savoury ice cream parlour is opening its doors in London this week - and smoked salmon, cream cracker and cheese flavoured ice cream is on the menu . All the flavours on offer are made using Jacob’s savoury snacks, including Twiglets and Mini Cheddars and, even better, they’ll be free to all visitors. A spokesperson for Jacob's, who are behind the concept, said: 'Jacob’s is always looking for ways to bring its flavours to people in new ways, but I never thought I would see the day when we would be serving a Jacob’s Cream Cracker with ice cream. 'Having previewed the flavours during production I can guarantee that anyone who visits us is in for a real treat.' Yum? The store, created by Jacobs, will use some of their snacks such as mini cheddars and even twiglets to create the savoury ice cream . The store, which is located in Soho, will also crowdsource a flavour via suggestions made on Twitter. Savoury ice creams are having a moment over in the U.S., where chorizo combined with caramel, and cherry-miso flavoured dessert is all the rage. 'I like the marriage of salty and sweet and savoury and sweet,' Sam Mason of OddFellows Ice Cream Co. in Brooklyn told Today.com. 'There is a large segment of people who want something new and exciting that they’ve never had before or would have never thought possible in ice cream form, and I like challenging those people to try it.' Salt and Straw in Portland, Oregon, meanwhile, serves up a black raspberry and smoked ham flavour, as well as pear with blue cheese and goat cheese with habanero. Bizarre: OddFellows Ice Cream Co. in Brooklyn, New York, offer all sorts of savoury snacks, including Guinness flavoured, left, and even foie gras, right . Ingredients . DIY: Blue Cheese & Jacob's Cream Cracker Ice Cream Sandwiches . Method . 1. Pour the cream, milk and sugar into a saucepan. Bring slowly to the boil then remove from the heat and allow to cool a little. 2. Whisk together the salt and egg yolks in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. 3. Slowly pour the slightly cooled milk and cream onto the egg mixture, stirring constantly. Do not use boiling milk as this can turn your egg mixture into scrambled eggs. 4. Pour the mixture back into the pan and slowly heat, stirring with a wooden spoon continuously, until it has reached 85C (185F). 5. Add the cubed stilton to the saucepan and stir over a low to medium heat until it has all melted. Remove from the heat. 6. Taste and season with lemon juice and a little salt or pepper if necessary. 7. Cool down to 4C (39F) within 90 minutes. To do this, either place the mix in a pan in a sink with cold water and ice cubes, or put the mix in a Ziploc bag inside a pan of cold water with ice cubes. 8. Pour the mixture into an ice-cream maker and churn. Scoop the churned ice cream into a container and allow it to firm up a little before you start assembling your cream cracker sandwiches. 9. Once your ice cream is a little firmer, take it out of the freezer and scoop two generous tablespoons onto one Cream Cracker, season with a good twist of black pepper, and sandwich with a second Cracker. Press down, and use a palette knife to smooth around the edges for a clean finish. 10. Have your packaging - either the plastic tub or some waxed paper - ready, and place each sandwich back in the freezer quickly to firm up before serving.","New savoury ice cream parlour opening in Soho, London .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito has revealed she has 'high risk HPV', a sexually-transmitted disease that can cause cancer. She made the announcement on Twitter on Sunday, explaining that she learned about her human papillomavirus diagnosis on Friday following a long overdue gynecologist's appointment. 'At recent #GYN visit alarmed to find out last one, 2yrs ago,' she wrote on Sunday evening. 'Friday got call re: results. Told have ""high risk HPV."" #Biopsy needed #ASAP.' Diagnosis: Melissa Mark-Viverito, pictured last week, revealed on Twitter on Sunday that she has human papillomavirus, a sexually-transmitted infection that can cause cervical cancers . The 45-year-old went on: 'To say . I'm not wee bit worried = lie. ""High risk HPV"" can POTENTIALLY but NOT definitively lead to cervical #cancer.' An aide to Mark-Viverito, who is not married, explained to the New York Daily News that she went public with the news in an attempt to help de-stigmatize the condition, which is the most common sexually transmitted infection. 'Yes, I’m an extremely private person,' her first tweet read. 'But this position has led me to understand I now have a bigger responsibility.' She added she had 'struggled & came to conclusion it would be best to disclose & share process I’m going thru hoping it can be helpful to others. Speaking out: She said she revealed her diagnosis on Twitter to de-stygmatize the infection . Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Around 79 million Americans are infected, according to the CDC. Although in many cases the virus may cause no symptoms, in other people, it can cause genital warts or cervical cancer. The infection occurs primarily through skin-to-skin contact, and can be transmitted through sexual intercourse, anal sex or oral sex. Rarely, a mother can transmit the virus to her baby during delivery. Two vaccines have been introduced in the U.S. to be given to schoolchildren aged 11 to 12. The vaccine is given at a young age because it offers the best protection before a person has become sexually active. 'Our . health should never be compromised. Annual physicals have . to be sacred. Yet our health care system doesn't lend itself to this . for many.' After she shared the diagnosis online, she received numerous messages of support. 'Madam Speaker, we pray for positive results!' Brooklyn Councilman Chaim Deutsch tweeted. Another Twitter user, Kara A Mergl, wrote: 'Recently went through same issue. Biopsy and surgery. Thanks for being a voice for women's health.' HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. and around 79 million Americans are infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 10,000 U.S. women diagnosed with HPV contract cervical cancer, and the infection can also cause other cancers, often years after the infection is contracted. There is no treatment for HPV but there are vaccines and tests can allow for higher survival rates.","Melissa Mark-Viverito, 45, shared her diagnosis on Twitter on Sunday .

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . Coleen Rooney, Alex Gerrard, Victoria Beckham and Cheryl Cole may have been ridiculed for their high octane glamour when they landed in Baden Baden for the World Cup in 2006, but it seems the ladies of Liverpool are keen to uphold the WAG dress code. As the Liverpool football team emerged triumphant on the opening weekend of the season having beat Southampton 2-1 yesterday, it was their glossy girlfriends who garnered more attention. Anfield was awash with pink hot pants, cleavage baring tops, Isabel Marant wedged trainers and studded Valentino stilettos courtesy of the WAGS. Scroll down for video . All things bright and beautiful? Lucas Pezzini Leiva's wife Ariana commanded the most attention in her bold pink co-ords, which she accessorised with studded Valentino heels . The WAG with perhaps the most eye-catching of outfits was Lucas Pezzini Leiva's wife Ariana. Wearing vibrant pink shorts and matching cropped bolero teamed with a white shirt and studded Valentino heels, Ariana was clearly making the most of the last of the summer weather. The blonde-haired model even coordinated her lipstick to her bold pink co-ords. The Brazilian footballer and defensive midfielder's wife became notorious after a particular incident in 2012. Lucas was left red-faced with embarrassment after his model wife called the police to check if he was OK after being substituted with a knee injury against Manchester City. All pink, everything! The blonde-haired model even coordinated her lipstick to her bold pink co-ords and made the most of the warmer August weather by getting her legs out . Aine Coutinho was also out to support her husband Philippe, a Brazilian footballer who plays for Liverpool as an attacking midfielder. Wearing a slightly less garish outfit, the young WAG looked a little more casual in black cropped trousers and a leather look blazer. She did, however, stick to the WAG protocol with sky-high Christian Louboutin stilettos and a pair of dazzling drop diamond earrings. Having met and fallen in love very young, the 22-year-old credits his wife, whom he married in 2012, for his peace of mind (and perhaps his sense of style, too). We can't work out who's more fashionable! Aine Coutinho joined husband Philippe, a Brazilian footballer who plays for Liverpool as an attacking midfielder, and gave him and his Gucci shows a run for their money in her sky-high Louboutins .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott for MailOnline . Just a month after she filed for divorce from actor Josh Lucas, Jessica Henriquez has opened up about another tragic loss; half of her hearing. Ms Ciencin Henriquez, a 28-year-old writer and mother-of-one based in New York, was working as an office assistant four years ago, when out of nowhere, an agonizing piercing sound struck her ears; forcing her straight to the ER, where doctors diagnosed her with 'sudden hearing loss' in one ear. 'I can’t hear you. I can’t hear anything!' Ms Ciencin Heriquez writes for Salon, recalling her heartbreaking words to her doctor during the hospital hearing test. 'At 24, I had gone from a feisty, uninhibited, outspoken yogini to a statistic.' Nightmare moment: Writer and mother-of-one Jessica Ciencin Henriquez (pictured) has opened up about suddenly and inexplicably losing her hearing in one ear, a day in 2010 which would change her life forever . In addition to losing her hearing in one ear, Ms Ciencin Henriquez struggled with accompanying nausea and vertigo, and it was months before she managed to regain her balance. 'New York City, the vibrant place I’d once fallen madly for, became a nightmare,' she writes. 'The streets were humming, whirring. Tractors moaned, ambulances screamed, the click of lighters and the hiss of brooms brushing cafe floors were torture.' Only a year later, Ms Ciencin Henriquez would meet 42-year-old Sweet Home Alabama star Josh Lucas quite by chance at a New York dog park; marry him soon after and have their son Noah, now two. A Found love: A year after she lost half her hearing, Ms Ciencin Henriquez (right) met 42-year-old Josh Lucas (center) at a New York dog park, married him soon after and had son Noah, now two (left) But dating immediately after she lost her hearing was nothing short of 'bleak,' according to her account. 'Men would repeat their clever lines only once or twice before mumbling ""never mind"" and moving onto the next woman,' she writes. 'Deaf was not sexy, deaf was mortifying.' For months, Ms Ciencin Henriquez refused to leave the house much and when she did, she was anxious and withdrawn. Because her condition was 'invisible' and she had retained hearing in one ear, she just about got away with hiding her disability - a term she admits she has only recently become comfortable using - from friends. But only for so long. 'Deaf was not sexy, deaf was mortifying' Eventually, as the hearing in her other ear began to fade, she was forced to make her peace with it. And while she confesses she will always be known as 'someone’s half-deaf friend Jess', she says it no longer defines her. Now she arrives to dinner parties early to nab a seat at the end of the table so as to expose her good hear to as many guests as possible, and has sourced special headphones which enable her to enjoy music properly. Happier times: While Ms Ciencin Henriquez (left, in 2013) - who split with Mr Lucas (right) in January - confesses she will always be known as 'someone's half-deaf friend Jess', she says it no longer defines her . Sadly, Ms Ciencin Henriquez has also had to accept the fact that her good ear will also eventually fail her. 'Because one ear is strained from doing the work of two, I will completely lose my ability to hear,' she writes. 'It will happen sooner rather than later and knowing that is terrifying.' It's not the only brush she has had with ill health. The year after Ms Ciencin Henriquez lost her hearing, and right before she met Mr Lucas, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. In an interview with The Huffington Post, she reveals that her then-new boyfriend, now ex-husband, was the first person she shared the news with. 'I will completely lose my ability to . hear. It will happen sooner rather than later and knowing . that is terrifying' 'I just blurted out. ""I'm sick,"" and he was the first person I told. It was terrifying to say it out loud because it gave it power and made it real, and it meant that I had cancer,' she said. Just six weeks into their relationship, and while Ms Ciencin Henriquez was undergoing grueling treatment, Mr Lucas proposed to her. They married in 2012. What . break up? Mr Lucas and Ms Ciencin Henriquez were seen in New York looking rather affectionate with . each other in April (pictured) after their split in January, and before they filed their divorce papers in June . Just as doctors informed her that she would likely have to undergo a hysterectomy, she discovered she was pregnant, and against the advice of 'every oncologist' she spoke to, Ms Ciencin Henriquez went ahead with the 'difficult but successful' pregnancy. 'When we were picking baby names, we specifically picked the name Noah, because it meant “calm and restful,”' she wrote. 'We were like, ""Wow, that’s what we need. 'We need something in our life that’s just going to be so calm and peaceful because we haven’t had that since we’ve been together.""' In January of this year, the couple split and last month Ms Ciencin Henriquez filed for divorce. She has neglected to say why; but both parties insist that their parting was mutually amicable. In a recent interview with People, Mr Lucas said: 'We have been through a divorce and divorce isn't something I would wish on my worst enemy. 'Even when in our case we have managed to do it not only amicably but as - hopefully in the end great friends - particularly because we have a young child that we both truly love.'","Ms Ciencin Henriquez lost her hearing in one ear in 2010 and will soon be deaf in the other .

"By . Kieran Corcoran for MailOnline . Six people were hurt - and one seriously injured - when a miniature train derailed at a safari park yesterday. The rear carriage of the Jungle Express at Longleat, Wiltshire, overturned, trapping one person underneath and injuring five others. Firefighters and paramedics were sent to the family attraction. But by the time they arrived the trapped person was reportedly pulled free by frantic visitors at the park. Struggle: Visitors to the park fought to turn the train upright as one person was trapped underneath . A total of 115 people - including many children - were on the train at the time. Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service said two crews were dispatched to the scene at 3.45pm today. Three ambulances and an air ambulance were also sent amid fears of a major incident at the popular attraction.

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . The North-South divide over the cost of a home has widened even further as new figures show asking prices in London are 42 per cent higher than before the recession. A study by property website Rightmove has found house sellers' asking prices in Cambridgeshire, Berkshire, Surrey and the capital have made the strongest gains since the financial crisis struck. But those in County Durham, the Isle of Wight, West Yorkshire and Teesside have the furthest distance still to recover, according to the website. House sellers' asking prices in London, Cambridgeshire, Berkshire and Surrey have made the strongest gains since the financial crisis struck, according to a property website (file picture) With an average price tag of £1.5 million, average asking prices in central London and the City now tower 41.9 per cent above the levels seen when the housing market was at its pre-crisis peak in May 2008, Rightmove found. West London, which like central London has been a strong pull for wealthy overseas investors, has seen the next strongest price growth since the previous peak of the market, with average property asking prices now standing at £564,192, which is 41.7 per cent higher than in May 2008. The study, which covered England and Wales, found that at the other end of the scale, property prices in County Durham had the biggest percentage jump still left to climb to reach their levels at the previous peak of the market. The average asking price in County Durham stands at £114,554, which is 13.4 per cent below the typical amount requested by sellers in May 2008. In Teesside and West Yorkshire, asking prices are still around 9.1 per cent below 2008 levels, while in the Isle of Wight they still have a 10.7 per cent climb. All areas of London have seen asking prices increase by at least 30 per cent when compared with May 2008, Rightmove said. The study also found that asking prices in South Wales are at 1.9 per cent below their 2008 levels. Pictured here are homes for sale in Cardiff . Outside London, Cambridgeshire has seen the strongest recovery in sellers' asking prices, Rightmove found, with prices up by 21.9 per cent on their 2008 levels to reach £311,933 typically. The London commuter belt areas of Berkshire and Surrey have seen the next strongest asking price growth, recording increases of 16.4 per cent and 16.1 per cent respectively since 2008. Looking further north, Rightmove found that only a handful of areas have seen asking prices surpass their pre-crisis peak levels. Cheshire and North Yorkshire bucked the general northern trend, with asking prices there having nudged above the previous peak of the market. House sellers' asking prices in Cheshire are now 1.1 per cent higher than in 2008, standing at £213,618 on average. Those in North Yorkshire have reached £244,776, which is 0.1 per cent higher than in 2008. But stepping over the North Yorkshire border into Lancashire, asking prices in the county are still 9 per cent below the peak of the market, at £153,339 typically. The study also found that asking prices in South Wales are at 1.9 per cent below their 2008 levels, while those in North and Mid Wales have a 6.9 per cent climb to get back to the 2008 peak. The figures come from a new 'house price trendometer' tool which Rightmove has created to allow people to see how asking prices in their area have fared since the website's records started in 2001. Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, said: 'While at a high level the South has out-performed the North, being able to dig underneath that courtesy of the millions of properties advertised on Rightmove since 2001 shows a really varied county versus county performance.'","Study by property website Rightmove found gap is widening .

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . The United Arab Emirates has advised its citizens to stay away from several shopping and nightlife districts in central London because of the danger of crime. London is one of the most popular destinations for Gulf Arab tourists looking to escape brutal summer heat. Many flock to the capital's most expensive areas such as Mayfair and Knightsbridge. However, reports of an attack on three Emirati women and their children at a London hotel in April and a masked robbery of an Emirati couple in their London apartment shocked the public in the UAE, where crime rates are low. Scroll down for video . The United Arab Emirates has advised its citizens to stay away from Oxford Circus  in the commercial heart of Central London . A statement on the UAE's foreign ministry website told citizens to avoid areas 'where pickpocketing, fraud and theft are frequent and where it is not advised to live'. An attached map singled out Edgware Road, the area between Marble Arch and Tottenham Court Road, and the Oxford Circus and Bond Street area. It also identified Shepherd's Bush and Queensway as areas that were 'less dangerous'. When asked about the UAE foreign ministry's advice, the Metropolitan Police said London was one of the safest major cities in the world and that crime was falling. 'There is absolutely nowhere in London which should be avoided,' Metropolitan Police Service Commander Makhdum Chishty said in a statement. 'We understand the incident involving Emirati nationals earlier this year was shocking, but it was also very, very rare.'

Amna Mohamed, a university student, said that some Emirati tourists drew unnecessary attention to themselves by wearing extravagant clothes and accessories. 'I would still go because I know those places and I know what to wear when going to them,' she said.","London is one of the most popular destinations for Gulf Arab tourists .

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . Sex offences on Britain's railway network have soared by 21 per cent in just 12 months, reveal latest crime figures. British Transport Police said the huge year-on-year increase was partly caused by high-profile prosecutions of celebrities such as Max Clifford for historic sex offences. There were 1,117 incidents of sexual . offences recorded by British Transport Police (BTP) in 2013/14 (the 12 . months ending March 2014) - a 20.8 per cent increase on the 925 in 2012/13. Most of the increase was accounted . for by incidents of sexual crime against females, which rose from 485 in . 2012/13 to 624 in 2013/14. British Transport Police the high-profile prosecutions of celebrities such as Max Clifford (right) for historic sex offences has helped more victims come forward . Disgraced PR guru Clifford was jailed for eight years for a string of sexual offences in May. BTP . chiefs said cases like his have 'undoubtedly' given victims more confidence . to come forward. The force said a BTP-led initiative, called Project . Guardian, had also had a 'significant' impact in London. BTP said: 'Part of this increase can . be attributed to the high-profile prosecutions of celebrities for . historical offences which have, undoubtedly, given victims more . confidence to come forward.' BTP Chief Constable Paul Crowther said: 'Project Guardian, a joint initiative between BTP, Metropolitan Police Service Safer Transport Command, City of London Police and Transport for London, focuses on increasing awareness and confidence amongst the public to report unwanted sexual behaviour to the police or members of staff. 'We are particularly interested in those offences which are often unreported, such as sexual assault, exposure, outraging public decency, lewd comments and harassment.' The force said a BTP-led initiative, called Project Guardian, had also had a 'significant' impact in London . Overall crime on Britain's railways has fallen for the tenth year in a row, according to BTP statistics. Notifiable . crime - which makes up the more serious offences dealt with by the . Force - fell by six per cent during 2013/14 - meaning there were more . than 3,000 fewer victims of crime than the previous year. There were 1,117 incidents of sexual offences recorded by British Transport Police (BTP) in 2013/14 (the 12 months ending March 2014) - a 20.8% increase on the 925 in 2012/13. Most of the increase was accounted for by incidents of sexual crime against females, which rose from 485 in 2012/13 to 624 in 2013/14. Sexual crime against males rose from 27 in 2012/13 to 42 in 2013/14 while cases of exposure increased from 141 to 148, with incidents of other sexual crime going up from 272 to 303. BTP said the increase in sexual offences was slightly higher than that experienced by police forces nationally. Covering England, Wales and Scotland, the BTP figures showed that overall for 2013/14, notifiable crime, which makes up the more serious offences dealt with by BTP, fell by 5.7% from 53,885 to 50,840 - meaning there were more than 3,000 fewer victims of crime than in 2012/13. Chief . Constable Crowther said notable achievements included a reduction of 18 . per cent in recorded robberies, a 17 per cent drop in theft of . passenger property and a 37 per cent fall in theft of cable from the . railway. He added: . 'The initiatives and operations which have made such an impact during . the past 12 months really highlight the advantage our specialist . knowledge brings to the railway. 'By working . with the rail companies and passengers, we are able to truly understand . the challenges they face and devise innovative solutions to tackle those . problems.' In 2012 theft of passenger property was highlighted by both passengers and train operators as a growing concern, as thieves turned to trains and stations which offered supposed easy pickings. In response BTP launched Operation Magnum, an awareness campaign which drew on the knowledge and experience of rail officers and staff to advise passengers about the most common tactics used by thieves - as well as tips to avoid falling victim. Chief Constable Crowther said: 'We have led the way in combating theft and there can be little doubt that Operation Magnum, which was driven by online content and social media, has had the desired effect with almost 3,000 fewer people falling victim to this type of crime year-on-year. 'During 2013/14 we also continued to spearhead efforts to tackle metal and cable theft both on the railway, and in other sectors, through the National Metal Theft Taskforce - bringing about a 37 per cent fall in railway cable theft which, in turn, significantly reduced the delays and disruption faced by the railway as a result of criminal activity.' The Chief Constable, who was appointed in May this year, added: 'For the coming months and years we will have one simple goal - to make sure everyone who travels or works on the railway can get home everyday, safe, secure and on time.'","Police chiefs say high-profile cases have helped more victims  come forward .

"By . Craig Hope for MailOnline . Follow @CraigHope_DM . They say Manchester United’s defeat by Swansea was the best thing that could have happened, exposing their shortcomings before it is too late to act. Perhaps the same theory can be applied to Newcastle United. For while their 2-0 loss to champions Manchester City was rich in spirit, skill, endeavour and enthusiasm, it was nonetheless lacking one key ingredient — a shot on target. Indeed, they were the only top-flight team not to trouble an opposition goalkeeper during the opening weekend. Blunt: £6million signing Emmanuel Riviere failed to get his name on the scoresheet at St James' Park . Under pressure: Ayoze Perez, left, found his way blocked by the formidable figure of Vincent Kompany . The Magpies failed to score in 13 of their final 21 matches last season and the suspicion is that an impotent offence could undermine their progress this time around. Final balls were wayward — shooting likewise — and, for all their attacking intent, they lacked the penalty-box instinct of a David Silva or Sergio Aguero, the players who ultimately settled this affair. City boss Manuel Pellegrini agreed. ‘I didn’t feel Newcastle had clear chances to score except in the last two minutes of the game,’ said the Chilean, referencing Ayoze Perez’s goal-bound shot deflected wide by a sliding Fernando. Alan Pardew’s Tyneside tenure has been defined by goalscorers: Andy Carroll, Demba Ba, Papiss Cisse and, last season, Loic Remy. Emmanuel Riviere — a £6m signing from Monaco — is the man charged with filling his boots — and the net — this season. Comeback trail: Dutch playmaker Siem de Jong should help Newcastle get firing on all cylinders . But Pardew feels goals reside in other areas of the squad, even if some of those players remain in the treatment room. ‘We’re still missing Papiss (Cisse) and Siem de Jong, two massive players for us that we’ve paid a financial outlay on,’ he said, when asked if he would be re-entering the transfer market. ‘They’re big players. So no, I feel once they’re in and around the squad we’ll score goals. Impressive: Remy Cabella in possession during a promising display against the Premier League champions . ‘We were playing the champions today and sometimes you don’t get any shots against the champions. But I thought we had a really good go.’ Playmaker Remy Cabella was the pick of Pardew’s five debutants and the manager likened him to City’s Silva. But every Cabella needs a goalscorer to exploit his cunning. And to that end Newcastle remain short. Pardew has until September 1 to do something about it.","Emmanuel Riviere and Ayoze Perez failed to trouble Manchester City .

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . Addiction is blighting the lives of many classical musicians as they grapple with performance anxiety and antisocial hours, a cellist has said. Rachael Lander features in a new Channel 4 documentary which brings together classical musicians whose careers have been derailed by drug and drink problems. The cellist, who was addicted to alcohol and prescription pills, said the problem is rife in the classical music world. Composer James McConnel (pictured) was inspired to lead the project after the death of his son Freddy, who was an associate of the late Peaches Geldof . Ms Lander, who began drinking to medicate her panic attacks in the concert hall, told Radio Times magazine: 'Addiction problems are widespread among classical musicians, for many reasons. 'There is the lifestyle, the odd hours, working weekends, post-concert socialising. 'Many players use alcohol and beta-blockers to control their performance anxiety and then, after the 'high' of a performance, musicians can struggle to 'come down' and therefore drink to relax - which becomes habitual.' Lander left her profession to become a waitress as she battled with her addictions. 'I remember being in the National Youth Orchestra as a teenager, and we were doing the BBC Proms. I had this overpowering feeling of not being able to move in the way I wanted to - I felt trapped. I couldn't cope with the adrenaline, and I felt myself tipping into panic attacks,' she told the magazine. 'When I drank, these attacks stopped. I also took Valium and beta-blockers. So you could block the adrenal gland and still hang on to your mental capacity. The Valium was great because... because I didn't really have to be in the room.'

He had been identified as a gifted child, was a member of Mensa and had competed on the BBC's Junior Mastermind. McConnel said it was 'one of those rare programmes which is not only entertaining and informative, but which has done some real, long-term good'. He added: 'For me, watching a group of people brave enough to address their addictions and fear - through music - was both humbling and inspirational.'","Rachael Lander features in a new Channel 4 about drink and drug problems .

Cancer sufferer Jack Keppie, given just months to live, was attacked from behind by two men in their 20s while on his way home after drinking with friends in his local pub. Mr Keppie, 69, was left with two suspected broken ribs and bruises up his arms and legs after the assault and robbery in Denton, Greater Manchester. He said: 'I thought that was it to be honest - they could have killed me without a doubt. But eventually, they just ran off. They're disgusting. I've got terminal prostate cancer, I don't need this sort of thing happening, it was horrendous. Terminally ill great-grandfather Jack Keppie, 69, from Denton, Greater Manchester, outside his local pub the Angel in Denton, after he was attacked from behind by two men in their 20s while on his way home . 'I looked behind me to make sure no-one was following me, but out of nowhere, I got smacked on the back on the head and fell to the ground and landed on my stomach. 'They took my wallet out of my pocket, took the cash out then threw the wallet very aggressively in my face. Then they called me a few names and started kicking me in the stomach. They toddled off up the road, never to be seen again.' Diagnosed with prostate cancer last October and given 12 months to live, Mr Keppie's failing health has deteriorated ever since. But in the days leading up to the attack on August 5, he regained some strength in his legs and felt confident enough to walk alone to his local pub, the Angel in Denton, and join his friends for a drink. But as he walked home, the two thugs, both aged around 20, attacked him from behind, one punching him in the back knocking him to the ground, before the other stood on his back and stole £100 from his wallet. The pair kicked and swore at the defenceless pensioner as he lay on the pavement before making off. Cancer sufferer Jack Keppie said having a pint with his friends is one of his few remaining pleasures . Mr Keppie added: 'It won't stop me going out, but I'm looking behind me all the time now, I'm very cautious. I still go out, but I don't walk alone anymore. It's a short distance, but it's not worth the risk. 'It's a cowardly way to attack someone. I've got prostate cancer and they're kicking me in the stomach. They are cowards and just typical hoodies. I just don't want it to happen again. 'They should have a conscience and give themselves up. One day, this will come back to them. 'They don't deserve to be living, they're not human beings. Luckily, I've got a lot of close friends around me, looking after me. It won't happen again if they have anything to do with it.' Detective Constable Fiona Rigby, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This was a vicious and cowardly attack on a frail and dying man. 'He has terminal cancer and is very ill. In fact he doesn't have long to live. One of his remaining pleasures in life is to walk to his local pub for a couple of beers with his friends. 'Now because of the despicable actions of these cowards, this modest pleasure has been utterly destroyed. 'Walking to and from the pub was part of his ritual, no doubt bringing him a modicum of independence. Now he has to get a taxi out of fear. 'The robbers probably wouldn't have known about his condition, but one look at him would have told them he was frail, vulnerable and clearly not going to put up a fight - precisely why these bullies picked on him no doubt.' Anyone in the area near the allotments on Wood Street in Denton around midnight on August 5 is urged to call police. The attackers are described as aged around 20, 5ft 8in or 9in, with local accents.

A paedophile groomed a schoolboy on Facebook and got him to creep away from home in the middle of the night for a meeting. Adam Brown, 21, who changed his name to Logan Brown by deed poll, was caught when the distraught mother of his victim turned detective to trap him. Brown had begun talking to the boy after posting videos of himself online, telling jokes and inviting people to say whether they found them funny. Cardiff Crown Court heard the mother worked nights and left her son and other children with their grandmother. But when she returned on July 3 she found the family's dog behaving oddly - and when she went to check on the family, she discovered the boy's bed was empty. She phoned him and he claimed he was just out for a walk. Prosecutor Gareth James said: 'She got back in her car, found him and confiscated his phone and later his computer, insisting he gave her the passwords. 'The conversation she saw online between her son and the defendant made her feel sick.' Within an hour of them being in touch, after the young teenager had clicked 'like' on a posting and Brown replied asking to be his Facebook friend, the talk had turned to sex. 'He told him he was cute and then made a sexual suggestion,' Mr James said. 'Then he said he might commit suicide if he didn't reply and there was an agreement to meet up in a park. 'The child left his home in the early hours and the defendant met him and gave him a hug.

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . Grandparents who look after children whose parents have died, fallen ill or are unable to provide adequate care could be given parental rights to paid leave, the Prime Minister has said. From next year adoptive parents will be entitled to nine months of paid leave. David Cameron said yesterday the Conservatives may consider a manifesto commitment to extending this new right to grandparents who become the guardians of their grandchildren. Prime Minister David Cameron has said some grandparents could be given parental rights to paid leave . They currently get a 'raw deal', according to the PM. He said: 'You do see sometimes grandparents stepping in and effectively bring up children, and of course under the rules they don't get quite the same rights as others. 'What you are saying is that if you can extend to adoptive parents things that birth parents have in terms of rights, couldn't you do that for grandparents? 'That is something I am very happy to look at in terms of the manifesto, and we have got some Conservative MPs here who have got some responsibility for giving me ideas, so I am sure they will take note of it.' It is estimated that more than 200,000 grandparents become their grandchildren's carers when parents die, become ill or because of drug and alcohol abuse.

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . Film critic Barry Norman has said Robin Williams was addicted to 'saccharine, tooth-rotting sentimentality' Veteran critic Barry Norman has sparked anger among film fans after claiming Robin Williams starred in a 'plenitude' of bad movies and was addicted to 'saccharine, tooth-rotting sentimentality'. In a column for the Radio Times, Norman said the much-loved late actor's talent 'could sometimes be spread so thinly as to be almost invisible'. The 80-year-old writer, who presented the BBC's Film programme until Jonathan Ross replaced him in 1998, also said  the Oscar-winner's legacy as a film actor would suffer. But fans of the star responded by saying Norman's comments were 'mean-spirited' and 'unsympathetic'. On Twitter, Mike Griffin said: 'Barry Norman, for what must be the millionth time, is wrong. Again.' Piano teacher Chris said: 'I think that's views on Robin are mean-spirited. I know who I'd rather watch.' Williams, . who died last week, won the best supporting actor Oscar for the 1997 . film Good Will Hunting and was nominated three further times. He is best known for his roles in Mrs Doubtfire, Good Morning Vietnam, Dead Poets Society The Fisher Kings, One Hour Photo and the TV comedy series Mork & Mindy. In his column, described as an 'honest tribute', Norman wrote: 'It's hard to know what to make of Robin Williams. 'Admiration . is called for, but also sadness, not just for his tragic death but for . an enormous talent which, if not exactly unfulfilled, could sometimes be . spread so thinly as to be almost invisible. 'Every . actor makes bad films occasionally but what was remarkable about . Williams was not that he was so good in the good ones but that he was so . very bad in the bad ones. 'He . made no secret of his addiction to drugs and alcohol but there was . another addiction, which he never admitted but which became increasingly . evident in his own work – to saccharine, tooth-rotting sentimentality. 'Were . the bad films made when drink or drugs played their part? You might . also ask, what caused a man of such gifts to rely so heavily on drink . and drugs?' Norman said Williams's role as the nanny in Mrs Doubtfire was 'uproarious Williams', but not his role as the father . 'An enormous talent': Robin Williams in the 1987 film Good Morning Vietnam . Norman's comments are in his column published in this month's edition of the Radio Times . Speaking about one of the actor's best-loved roles in Mrs Doubtfire, Norman said. 'The nanny is good, uproarious Williams; the father, all tearful sentimentality, is the bad one.' On the 1998 film What Dreams May Come, Norman said: 'It was unrelentingly weepy and he was so cringe-inducing that if it were the only Williams film you ever saw, you would say, with confidence, that he would never make an actor.' Williams was found dead in his home at the age of 63 and is survived by his three children and third wife Susan. Flowers and tributes placed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame star for late actor Robin Williams in Hollywood, California . Police said he died of asphyxia due to hanging. His wife later said her husband had been sober but ""not yet ready to share publicly"" his struggles with Parkinson's. She added that he had also been suffering from anxiety and depression. He added: 'I only met Williams once and then briefly at some film function. He was warm, charming, and funny, and I think everyone found him so. 'Certainly I never heard anyone badmouth him. If we forgive the bad films he is a great loss, because, given the right vehicle, he still had so much to offer.'","Norman, 80, said the late actor was in a 'plenitude' of bad films .

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . If investigating London’s vast network of sewers doesn’t sound like your idea of a romantic date, how about doing it search of great globules of fat blocking the drains? As unappealing as that sounds to most of us, one couple celebrated their love under the streets of the capital while on the lookout for ‘fatbergs’. Dan MacIntyre decided to surprise girlfriend Dunya Kalantery with the excursion to mark their one year anniversary. Dan MacIntyre and girlfriend Dunya Kalantery share a tender moment during their one-year anniversary celebrations in London's sewer system . The couple discovered their shared interest in greasy globules when a record 15-tonne fatberg was discovered under Kingston last year . The pair first discovered their mutual passion for fatbergs when the notorious 15-tonne, double decker bus-sized fatberg – the biggest ever found in the UK – was found causing chaos in Kingston a year ago. So Mr MacIntyre secretly wrote to Thames Water with the request to tour the sewers to celebrate their one-year anniversary. Mr MacIntyre, said: ‘It was incredible to see real-life fatbergs. We're very grateful to Thames Water for arranging this trip. It has been a dream come true - the perfect anniversary present!’ Shocked Dunya, said: ‘It was an amazing experience, the sewer architecture was incredible. It was a fantastic surprise.’ Fatberg is the term used by Thames Water to refer to a congealed lump of fat, which can often contain other items which don't break down, such as nappies, sanitary items and wet wipes . The pair spent a couple of hours with the Thames Water sewer team as they carried out maintenance work in Oxford Street, then went underground for forty minutes before resurfacing among the well-dressed crowds of Oxford Street revellers. 'Fatberg' is the term used by Thames Water to refer to a congealed lump of fat, along with other items which don't break down such as nappies, sanitary items and wet wipes. These masses collect and block the sewer pipes, causing clogs ortotal blockages. Last year a record 15-tonne fatberg was discovered under Kingston. The mass caused sewage flow through pipes to be reduced to 5 per cent of normal capacity. The blockage was so critical it threatened to blast untreated sewage through manhole covers onto the streets. Engineers who found the colossal blockage of congealed fat said they had never seen anything like it. In the late Nineties, Thames Water spent £2 million a year removing fat from its network - that figure bulged to £12million in 2012. It's not only disgarded cooking oil which is adding to current fatbergs, a 15 per cent annual rise in wet wipes has also been blamed - a product our Victorian sewers cannot deal with. Dave Dennis of Thames Water, who organised the bizarre date, said: ‘It was a pleasure to have Dan and Dunya along with us last night to help us ‘fight the fatberg’. ‘While fatbergs are an unusual sight that few people get to see, the real and very unromantic side of it is they cause serious blockages that lead to sewer flooding. So help my sewer team have a happy ending too - and remember the only thing that should go down the loo is toilet paper and human waste.’ However, the man in charge of London’s sewer network, Mike Gunn, was quick to dash the hopes of other couples hoping for a tryst in the bowels of London. He says he doesn't intend to open his manholes for anyone else. He added: ‘These two are fatberg crazy, and once we were over the shock of the request we didn’t want to stand in the way of true love. But, we are definitely not tour guides. Our sewers are dangerous and we have a serious job to do to keep them flowing. Sorry, before anybody gets any ideas, this was strictly a one-off.’","Dan and Dunya met in 2013 when a fatberg was causing havoc in London .

As 18st Lindsey Jones struggled into the too-tight bridal gown she had to accept she'd ballooned to a size 22. Bursting into ashamed tears, she made a vow to herself to lose weight before marrying her partner Sid. So the beauty therapist from Worcestershire joined a local Zumba class where dancing to sexy salsa, samba and reggaeton tunes helped her to lose a staggering 6st - and also helped her to find a fulfilling new career as a dance instructor. Scroll down for video . Weighing 18st (left) Lindsey found size 20 was too small but now has lost 6st (right) through Zumba . The mother-of-two from Bewdley, Worcestershire, would regularly snack on biscuits, cakes and crisps throughout the day, as well tucking into unhealthy takeaways every night and not eating a vegetable for weeks. She cried when she stood on the scales and tried to squeeze herself into a size 20 in a bid to deny her real dress size. But Lindsey decided to fight the flab and that evening signed up for a Zumba class. She had lost 2st in time for her wedding three months later and through committed twerking and salsa-ing she lost another 4st after her big day. Lindsey used to cry when she stepped on the scales (left) but is now delighted with her transformation . She has since trained as a Zumba instructor and has given up her career as a successful beauty therapist to lead five classes a week helping other women twerk away their tummies. Lindsey’s transformation has been so remarkable that last month she was invited to meet the creator of Zumba, Beto Perez. Lindsey said: 'It was getting to the point where a size 20 was too tight and I couldn’t bring myself to look at my real weight. I just cried standing on the scales. 'Cream cakes were my favourite things and I was sat eating one at work when I realised I couldn’t carry on like this anymore and I couldn’t get married at 18st. In the run up to her wedding, Lindsey became determined to drop her excess weight and began Zumba classes .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy for the Daily Mail . Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg last night accomplished a task that proved beyond them in the previous 25 days — talk to one another. The two Mercedes men have spoken publicly — and to their engineers — about each other since the latest hiccup in relations happened at the last race in Hungary on July 27, when Hamilton refused to follow a team instruction to let Rosberg pass. Rosberg described Hamilton’s stubbornness as ‘not good’ —strong words coming from Formula One’s Henry Kissinger. But Hamilton, speaking ahead of Sunday’s Belgian Grand Prix, is not in a mood to apologise. Tension: Hamilton and Rosberg are not on the best of terms currently . ‘I don’t feel I owe him anything,’ said the Brit, who is 11 points behind Rosberg in the drivers’ championship. ‘I’m not sure we need to talk. I wasn’t really involved much in his race and he did not get close enough to overtake. They said don’t hold him up, but he was never on my tail. ‘I made it hard for him to pass. That’s my job. ‘There was not right or wrong. I’m not upset with the team and they are not upset with me. I like to think I handled it quite well. I heard someone said I defied team orders. ‘It’s different when you’re sitting in the car and someone tells you that you need to react. You are not in as clear a moment as when you’re sitting here at the table. The team know I was right.’ Staying quiet: Rosberg doesn't want to heat up the fued anymore by adding more details . Rosberg, true to his diplomatic mien, said: ‘I gather it was a bit of a mess (in the media) after Hungary so it’s best I don’t add too much and not give too many details.’ He did not excuse Hamilton. The feud continues. It is difficult to apportion total blame, for while Hamilton should really follow instructions from the pit wall, the order was arguably unrealistic given the two drivers’ proximity in the standings and, as Hamilton argued at the time, the fact that Rosberg was not right on his team-mate’s gearbox. Britain’s Max Chilton, of Marussia, will sit out this race because of ‘contractual issues’, terminology which was widely perceived here as code for ‘run out of money’. He pays for his seat — worth an estimated £5million — through his father Grahame, an insurance magnate. Defiant: Hamilton insists he did nothing wrong by not letting Rosberg pass him . Max, 23, turned up at Spa in a black 4x4 and posed for photos with supporters, hoping to thrash out a last-minute deal to allow him to drive. It was not to be, and his place will be taken, for this race at least, by Alexander Rossi, a 21-year-old American with GP2 experience. ‘Although it was not our intention to offer Alexander the possibility to race this season, in light of the circumstances we are pleased to be providing him with the opportunity to make his debut,’ said Marussia team principal John Booth. ‘Naturally we hope to resume normal service with respect to our established race driver line-up as soon as possible. Marussia are a team without a big budget even if their owner is venture capitalist Andrey Cheglakov, a Russian billionaire.","The pair have now spoken to one another for the first time since an argument at the last race in Hungary on July 27 .

Not only that, the Dutchman, 51, who replaced Mauricio Pochettino at St Mary's this summer after the Argentinean jumped ship to Tottenham, faces a baptism of fire today as the Saints open their campaign at Anfield. The fixture emphasises a dramatic restructuring at Southampton. Liverpool have signed two Saints players so outstanding in 2013-14 they earned England World Cup call-ups, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert, as well as Dejan Lovren, the commanding centre-half who scored Saints' winner at Liverpool last season. All smiles: The Southampton players look to enjoy their training sessions in the build up to the new season . Eyes on the ball: Morgan Schneiderlin and Gaston Ramirez compete for the ball in training . Saints have also lost England left-back, Luke Shaw, to Manchester United, and fellow home-grown full-back Calum Chambers to Arsenal. But Koeman has overseen a rapid rebuilding he claims leaves Saints in good shape to repeat the 8th-placed finished they achieved under Pochettino. And he scoffs at relegation fears, saying: 'We are much better than some people think. 'I cannot do anything about that [other people's estimations]. If you'd like put some money on us to go down, I think you will lose it! 'What I've seen in the pre-season is that we are a much better team than other teams in the Premier League.' Looking up: Ronald Koeman is confident he will have a good season at Southampton . Saints have netted £97m from their five major sales and Koeman has brought in seven new faces at an initial cost of around £48m. That leaves almost £50m profit, some of which will clear debt racked up under the regime of former chairman Nicola Cortese and some of which may be spent on more new faces. Irish striker Shane Long, 27, at £12m from Hull has been the biggest purchase, followed by Serbian midfielder Dusan Tadic (£10.9m from Twente), England goalkeeper Fraser Forster (£10m, from Celtic), Italian striker Graziano Pelle (£9m, Feyenoord) and Hungarian defender Florin Gardos (£6m, Steaua Bucharest). Left-back Ryan Bertrand from Chelsea and Algerian midfielder Saphir Tadir from Inter Milan have arrived on loan with purchase options next summer. Southampton's executive hierarchy are comfortable they are not in a tailspin and share Koeman's optimism, privately stressing the summer's trading is nowhere near as negative for them or as positive for other clubs as had been painted. New signing: Koeman signed Shane Long from Hull this week . 'Of course in an ideal world you'd keep all your best players, Lallana and Shaw among them,' said one source. 'But you won't be seeing either of them for a few weeks because they're out injured or unfit. 'And nobody would begrudge Rickie's move but it was clear last season his legs meant he wouldn't be playing as key a role even here this season. Let's just say the buying clubs didn't under-pay.' Koeman admits Saints themselves may have overpaid for Long but says most players moving to English clubs are costing over the odds. 'It's not a [special] case of Shane Long,' he says. 'In general you pay too much money for players, especially in England.' Koeman laughs when asked if he is in a win-win situation where he will win plaudits for a repeat of last season's top-10 finish but be exonerated of blame if Saints flop because of the huge turnaround in players. 'If we are ninth, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, even 16th? … then we're doing a great job,' he smiles. 'It's an easy season for me as manager!' He doesn't mean it. He has his own specific targets, and they evidently include a respectable position in the top half or close while also continuing Saints' work of developing bright young talent. 'A successful season is if the team play in my way of playing, if the young players will develop and if we bring some good English players to the national team,' he says. 'And If we are in a position around eighth in the league. Maybe seventh, maybe eighth, maybe eleventh. There's not a specific position on the list. 'The most important thing is the players and team play under my philosophy … If they show me that, then I'm happy with the performance of the team.' Hurdles ahead include handling a disgruntled goalkeeper in Artur Boruc, displaced by Forster, and weighing up whether Morgan Schneiderlin, who threw a tantrum when not allowed to move cheaply to Tottenham, can play a pivotal role. Koeman says yes. He is as much optimist as pragmatist. Asked for Anfield memories he cites a 2-0 Champions League win as Benfica manager there in March 2006. Only later does he add he also lost there, twice, as boss of PSV. 'I prefer talking about winning!' he says. Looking on the bright side will be a valuable quality.","Ronald Koeman insists Southampton are in good shape for the new season .

"By . Steve Tongue, Reuters . Hull City will spend the money received for Ireland striker Shane Long on a replacement and already have names in mind, according to manager Steve Bruce. Despite only joining the Tigers in January, Long joined Southampton on Thursday for a fee reported to be around £12million. 'We got what, in our opinion, was a fabulous offer,' said Bruce. 'It happened so quickly. This time last week I would never have envisaged us being without him.' Defiant: Hull will invest Shane Long's transfer fee back into the squad, insists Steve Bruce . In action: Long played in both legs of Hull's recent Europa League tie against ASTrencin . Long played in both of Hull's Europa League qualifying matches this season and now the FA Cup finalists have promised to use the funds received from Southampton to strengthen their squad. 'We will invest that money into the squad to make it bigger and better, and we'll be looking to find a replacement,' Bruce added. Names: Bruce insists that the money will be spent, and that he already has a few players in mind . 'We've got irons in the fire. I'd like at least another three players to come through the door. The money that we got for Shane will allow us to do that.'

"Joe Root ensured there was no repeat of England's bad habits and old frailties as they took a giant step towards a series victory over India on day two of the fifth Investec Test. Root's unbeaten 92, a triumph of calm and then acceleration in stands of 80 with Jos Buttler and an unbroken 67 in only 10 overs with Chris Jordan, meant the hosts could quickly forget about their mini-collapse of three wickets for 13 runs. So close: England captain Alastair Cook missed out on an elusive century despite two reprieves . They were able to close on 385 for seven, with a lead of 237 and power still to add at The Oval - where captain Alastair Cook (79) and Gary Ballance (64) also contributed half-centuries. Second-wicket pair Cook and Ballance were part of that mid-afternoon wobble, after a partnership of 125, leaving Root and Buttler to put things right. Root especially did so to great effect, needing 93 balls for his fifth 50 of this series but then taking toll of a flagging attack as he hit seven more boundaries from only another 36 deliveries. Influential: England's Joe Root continued his rich vein for form by scoring a sparkling 92 . Ballance had lavish praise for his fellow Yorkshire batsman, and pointed out too that England of the recent past might easily have gone into terminal decline - as they did so often in last winter's Ashes and on several occasions this summer too - once wickets began to tumble. 'It was a bit of a wobble, a bit of a collapse - which is not ideal,' he said. 'Early on in the summer, it could have been an eight or nine-wicket collapse - but it was only four. 'They bowled well at us and got a few wickets, but the way Rooty and Jos counter-attacked was brilliant ... and really put us in a strong position.' Threat: England's Jos Buttler takes evasive action during the second day of the fifth Test . Barring a major recovery of the tourists' composure after two successive defeats already, England ought to convert their mid-match advantage into a 3-1 series win - and Root once more has played a significant part. 'He's played very positively,' added Ballance. 'He was patient, and got used to the pace of the wicket and then looked to score (more quickly) - and that's what he's done very well this summer. 'He's obviously got that ability (to change gear in an innings), and today he had a chance to put pressure back on India and did that very well and scored very quickly. Got him: India's Varun Aaron celebrates bowling Sam Robson of England for 37 runs . 'To watch how he's handled it after a tough tour of Australia and come back this summer and scored big, big runs - when the team needed them - just shows he's a quality player.' India off-spinner Ravi Ashwin has been impressed too by Root's energetic yet controlled approach to batting. 'He's a positive player, and is expressing himself more - for whatever reason. 'He's a hard competitor who I'd love to compete against every time I go out.' Head in hands: India's Varun Aaron shows his disappointment as Cook leads charmed life . Ballance, meanwhile, was able to reflect with satisfaction on another 50 - his sixth in 11 innings this summer - from the number three position previously filled so well for so long by Jonathan Trott. 'I hadn't batted much there before, but I've had a few gos this summer and feel quite good there now,' said the successful new incumbent. 'Trotty's shoes are massive to fill. He did so well over five or six years, and scored huge runs...but I hope I can look at what he did well, and try to replicate that.' Ballance appeared to have a fourth century in his sights in only his eighth Test, before an unusually tame dismissal to Ashwin. 'I was very disappointed to get out when I did. I thought I had a good chance to get a hundred there. 'You don't want to say you feel at home, because it's international sport and it's tough. '(But) I feel much more confident after this summer, and feel like I can do a decent job and kick on, have a decent career and put England in winning positions.","Root unbeaten on 92 and England captain Cook scored 79 .

"By . Craig Hope for MailOnline . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Siem de Jong is set to make his Newcastle United debut at Aston Villa on Saturday after recovering from a calf injury. The former Ajax captain – a £6million summer signing – missed the back end of pre-season as well as Sunday’s league opener against Manchester City. The Magpies were beaten 2-0 by the champions, failing to register a shot on target, and boss Alan Pardew said afterwards that the return of De Jong would aid his side’s offensive threat. Fighting fit: De Jong is poised to make his debut for Newcastle this weekend . And Pardew has now confirmed that the Holland international will feature for the lunchtime trip to Villa Park. ‘Siem de Jong has trained all week and will be in the squad for Villa,’ he said. ‘He missed last week, he is back this week and I think he is keen to start – we will have to wait and see if he is ready – but his enthusiasm is good and his CV and quality speak for themselves and hopefully he can produce a great season for us.’ Meanwhile, Cheick Tiote – a target of Lokomotiv Moscow – remains sidelined with a hamstring problem. But Pardew added: ‘Tiote has been running outside and working towards training.’","The £6million summer signing is set to make his debut against Villa .

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . and Ed Hawkins . The charges brought by the ECB against Lou Vincent and Naved Arif are the beginning of the end of a story that unfolded three years ago in sleepy Hove — 4,500 miles away from the global epicentre of match-fixing in Mumbai. If the charges are upheld, both men are likely to be banned for life. The case against Vincent has been one of the worst-kept secrets in cricket. Sportsmail revealed back in December that he was under investigation by the ICC’s anti-corruption unit, while the details of his involvement with cricket’s underworld were laid bare in this newspaper last week. In the dock: Former New Zealand batsman Lou Vincent has been charged with match fixing . The only surprise is that it has taken the authorities so long to bring charges against a player who has admitted to fixing matches as long ago as 2008. Arif’s alleged involvement was less well-known. A left-arm seamer whose 43-match first-class career produced an impressive 181 wickets at just 24 apiece for Pakistan sides Gujranwala and Sialkot, as well as Sussex, he is understood allegedly to have approached Vincent to enlist his help in fixing the 40-over game against Kent in August 2011. It was that match, as well as Sussex’s Twenty20 game against Lancashire in the same month, that has formed the basis of the charges laid by the ECB. In the game against Kent, Sportsmail understands that it is suggested that Vincent and Arif wore black sweatbands to indicate the fix was on. Chasing 217 to win, Sussex had raced to 76 without loss after 10 overs, and looked well on course for victory. Vincent, who has revealed the full extent of his involvement with match-fixing to the ACSU in what amounts to a plea bargain, came in at No 3 and was run out for a single, made from seven balls. Arif, who had allegedly persuaded Vincent to partake in the fix three days earlier during the drive north to Scarborough for a game against Yorkshire, arrived in the middle at No 9 with Sussex needing 74 off 13.4 overs. To the consternation of the Sussex dressing-room, Arif made 11 off 29 balls — a major factor in Kent’s eventual 14-run victory. He had earlier taken no wicket for 41 runs in six overs. Key role: Naved Arif's slow batting and poor bowling played a large part in Sussex's defeat . The bookie said to have organised the fix, ‘NG’, was reportedly at the match, and spoke to Vincent on the boundary when he was fielding, having apparently grown nervous at the fast start made by the Sussex openers. NG and Vincent had met each other, along with Arif, the previous night in a Brighton hotel, where Vincent had told NG he would take part in the fix. To collect his payment for helping throw the game — said to be £40,000 — Vincent had to supply the serial code of a £20 note to another bookie, known as ‘VG’, who was in on the scam. Vincent then met two men near Heathrow airport, and confirmed his identity by handing over the £20 note and undergoing a voice-recognition test. Suspicion immediately focused on the match because of the huge amounts of money placed on the outcome — £14m, more than twice the normal figure for a televised county game. Suspicious: Eyebrows were raised when £14million was placed on the match . On the community forum for the betting exchange Betfair, there was a running commentary, with several posters apparently aware when wickets would fall. This became key evidence for the ECB. In early 2012, under Chris Watts, the board’s anti-corruption chief who had started six months earlier, players were interviewed, betting data was analysed and betting experts were canvassed. There had been dismay among the ECB anti-corruption team that the ICC had cleared the game. One source said: ‘We couldn’t understand it. It was obvious the game needed to be looked at.’ But the situation may have been complicated by the fact that, at the time, Vincent told Sussex he had been approached to fix the game — but had turned it down. With no names passed on to the ICC, the investigation went nowhere, until it emerged in 2012 that Vincent had been interviewed about the game. Dismay: The ECB anti-corruption team could not believe the ICC initially cleared the match . The case was then reopened, leading to Thursday’s charges — though the ECB’s anti-corruption officials were close to charging the players last spring. A conviction would be a major feather in the ECB’s cap, especially in the light of accusations of ineffectiveness aimed at the ICC’s own anti-corruption unit — accusations that the ICC chief executive David Richardson angrily denied. On Thursday, the managing director of the England team Paul Downton told Test Match Special: ‘It’s an enormous concern — match-fixing is potentially a cancer for any sport. It is something the ECB takes extremely seriously.’ That last sentence is the kind of message cricket fans are longing to hear — and probably should have heard several years ago.","Lou Vincent and Naved Arif charge with fixing match between Sussex and Kent in August 2011 .

"By . Matt Barlow for MailOnline . Andros Townsend will play for the first time in Cyprus, the island where his mother's family hail from, and hope Tottenham's Europa League play-off can provide the same inspiration it did for him last year. Townsend sparkled against Dinamo Tblisi, 12 months ago, establishing him in the Spurs squad after a series of nine loan deals and catapulting him into the England team for crucial World Cup qualifiers. Injuries interfered with the end of the season and forced him to miss the World Cup in Brazil but he is fit for today's game against AEL Limassol in Larnaca. Home-grown: Andros Townsend's mother is from Cyprus, where he will play tonight against AEL Limassol . 'The Dinamo Tbilisi game was really the one that made me push on,' said Townsend, in an interview with the Tottenham Journal. 'This time it's special for me again because I'm half Cypriot and to go out and play in Cyprus for the first time will be quite special. Hopefully I can get the nod and have a similar impact as I did last year.' 'My mum's Cypriot and I've got family there who are hopefully going to come and watch me for the first time, so it should be a good game and a special occasion.' Townsend was born in Leytonstone to a Jamaican father Troy and a Cypriot mother Katerina, so he could have played international football for Cyprus, but has always represented England. He was handed his full debut by Roy Hodgson against Montenegro in October last year and responded with a brilliant goal, the third in a 4-1 win. Europa League: Townsend's performance at last year's play-off earned him a place in Spurs's starting XI . 'No matter what game you're playing in, as long as you're playing in front of the first-team manager there's always opportunities to impress, whether it's a training match or a Europa League match,' said Townsend. 'I did that last year and hopefully some of the boys who are on the bench this year can do the same.' Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino plans to rest some of his senior stars. Five of those who started against West Ham on Saturday have not travelled to Cyprus, and there will be opportunities for others, including Tottenham's three Belgians – Jan Vertonghen, Mousa Dembele and Nacer Chadli - who were not involved at Upton Park.

"By . Ryan Lipman . 'You were a moody, disrespectful little brat' - these are the vulgar words of a high school teacher  just 24 hours after one of his 16-year-old students committed suicide. Australian teacher Simon Cox posted the offensive rant, in which he also called the student a 'brat' and said he was happy he was 'gone', to his Facebook page. He then targeted the boy's parents, saying they had made excuses for their son, before finishing his extraordinary post by describing the boy's death as unimportant, signing off with; 'Nothing special - now I've got to wash my hair.' 'You were a bully to kids smaller and younger than yourself, I saw you intimidate, stand over and beat up on younger kids (never anyone your own size),' The Northern Territory teacher posted. Vulgar: Simon Cox posted a vulgar rant on his Facebook about a student who had just committed suicide . In his post, Mr Cox, pictured, accused the deceased teenager of making life 'hell' for other students and teachers . 'You made life hell for genuine students wanting to learn and teachers trying to teach. 'You were a moody, disrespectful little brat in and away from school who was always given excuses by your parents and soft people in authority. Your (sic) gone, good no sympathy or empathy from me. 'Nothing special - now I've got to wash my hair.' The boy's uncle, Peter Britten, said the family was left reeling by the shocking comments. 'It was unjustified,' he said. 'It seems (there was) a falling out between the teacher and the student.' Mr Britten said the hundreds of tributes flooding the student's Facebook page were proof he was popular, loved and a 'good kid'. 'He was so loved by everyone. I can't fathom what went down,' he said. 'Any suggestion he was bad is not true... he was not a bully - he  definitely was not a bully.' Struggling to comprehend why the teacher would post the message, Mr Britten said his nephew had had potential for a bright future. 'He was a stay at home kind of kid who looked up to his older brother who is a policeman and sister who is in the police, too.' The teacher was stood down following his post and is expected to be fired for this Facebook post . The post was eventually passed on to the outraged parents of other students who, blown away by the callousness of Mr Cox's rant, immediately contacted the school. Education department deputy chief executive Susan Bowden told MailOnline the department had been in contact with the family of the student regarding the post. '(The department) deeply regrets the stress to family and friends caused by this teacher’s alleged actions,' she said. 'The matter was brought to the attention of the department by a staff member and there have been a number of subsequent complaints received in response to the teacher’s alleged actions. 'This type of behaviour by any teacher is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.' Ms Bowden said Mr Cox was stood down on Tuesday, the same day the department became aware of the post. He has been given 24 hours to respond to the allegations. A decision on the teacher's employment will be made once all evidence had been considered, Ms Bowden added.","The Australian teacher posted the message the day after the pupil had committed suicide .

"By . Ian Ladybourn, Press Association . Hull KR caretaker coach Chris Chester claims his team's Super League play-off hopes will be on the line when they host reigning champions Wigan on Thursday night. A 28-10 defeat at Widnes in their last match left Rovers three points behind the eighth-placed Vikings, but a win over the Warriors, who have the chance to go top of the table, would keep the campaign alive for Chester's men with three matches left of the regular season. Chester, whose own position would be strengthened with a third win under his temporary charge, is hoping for a response after accusing his players of 'dishonesty' in their last outing. Destiny: Hull KR need to beat Wigan to keep their play-off hopes alive, says caretaker boss Chris Chester . Hope: Hull KR caretaker boss Chris Chester believes they can make the play-offs if they beat Wigan . Key man: Chris Chester will be part of the Hull KR side hoping to see off Wigan Warriors on Thursday . 'We've done a bit of soul-searching and had a few heart-to-hearts,' Chester said. 'We were dishonest against Widnes and we have addressed that in training over the past two weeks. 'Hopefully we'll get some kind of reaction with a much more professional performance against Wigan. 'We still believe. There are still eight points up for grabs and we have to make sure we put a good display in on Thursday and get a result. If we don't get a performance, it probably throws away our chances of making the play-offs. 'It's a tough ask but I watched the Bradford game in depth and they showed it can be done. They got in their faces early and we have to make sure we have a good start and stay with them.' Return: Blake Green will make his comeback from injury after a three-month layoff against old club Hull KR . Wigan's shock 16-8 defeat by Bradford last month means they have lost on five of their six trips into Yorkshire this year, but they won at Hull FC in May and inflicted on Rovers a club record 84-6 humiliation in the corresponding match in 2013. The Warriors had to work for their win over Hull KR at the DW Stadium in March and coach Shaun Wane is determined not to under-estimate his team's opponents. 'Hull KR is a tough place to go,' Wane said. 'It is an old-style ground and they are a good team. 'They are well coached by Chris Chester who I know well. He will have them very motivated as they want to get into the top eight and ensure their season does not end after four games. 'We got our fingers burnt at Bradford and Wakefield so I am sure we will go there with a good attitude and our players understand that the games left are all like Grand Finals.' Return: Green (right), who played stand-off for Hull KR between 2011 and 2012, has had a bicep injury since May . The 2013 double winners, who have already relinquished their hold on the Challenge Cup, are two points behind St Helens but have a superior points difference so would leapfrog their arch rivals, at least for 24 hours, with a win at the KC Lightstream Stadium. 'We want to win the League Leaders' Shield so we have four Grand Finals left, which if we win, then puts the pressure all on St Helens,' Wane added. Wigan's former Hull KR stand-off Blake Green will make his comeback from a three-month lay-off, caused by a ruptured bicep, and Wane is also able to call on forward Eddy Pettybourne, who has been out for a month with a jaw injury.

"By . Chris Wheeler for MailOnline . Among the messages doing the rounds on social media after Southampton’s defeat at Liverpool on Sunday were a number suggesting that James Ward-Prowse had just earned himself a move to Anfield. However tongue-in-cheek the comments, they might not have gone down particularly well with those Saints fans still smarting at the way their team has been pillaged by Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers this summer. Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren have all departed St Mary’s for Merseyside while Luke Shaw moved to Manchester United for £27million. There is still plenty of cause for optimism on the South Coast, however. The conveyor belt of young talent that has produced the likes of Gareth Bale, Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in recent years has discovered another gem in Ward-Prowse. Young star: James Ward-Prowse earned praise for his performance against Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday . Moved on: Croatian defender Dejan Lovren joined Liverpool from Southampton this summer for £20m . In the stands: Former Southampton player Adam Lallana watches his new club Liverpool in action on Sunday . Respect: Liverpool striker Rickie Lambert shakes hands with Southampton manager Ronald Koeman . The 19-year-old midfielder’s dead-ball technique and crossing ability has already brought comparisons with David Beckham. He scored his first goal for England Under-21s with a freekick against Lithuania last October and another stunning set-piece against Brazil was voted the best goal at this summer’s Toulon Tournament where Ward-Prowse was also named among the top three players. At Anfield on Sunday, he enhanced his growing reputation with a succession of impressive dead-ball deliveries in Southampton’s 2-1 defeat to Liverpool. No surprise then that he is already being tipped to follow Lallana and his old friend Shaw into the big-time at both club and international level. A young man who grew up admiring Beckham’s style was not even born when Ronald Koeman’s freekick for Holland broke England’s hearts and knocked Graham Taylor’ s team out of qualifying for the 1994 World Cup, but he could not be in better hands after the Dutchman replaced Mauricio Pochettino as Southampton boss this summer. ‘I searched things online when we were linked with him and I found some great goals on YouTube,’ said Ward-Prowse, who was used in his preferred central midfield role in Koeman’s first league game rather than wide on the right under Pochettino.

So close: Ward-Prowse (centre) and Shane Long (right) react after a missed opportunity at Anfield . ‘I’ve studied videos of Beckham as well and he’s someone I do look to compare myself to in terms of set-piece deliveries. He was a big role model for me, not only on the pitch but off the pitch – the way he applies himself.’ Ward-Prowse insists he has never touched a drop of alcohol and has no interest in the party scene frequented by so many young Premier League footballers. He joined Saints at the age of eight after turning down their great rivals Portsmouth, his hometown team. James, his father John and older brother Ben were all big Pompey fans. ‘At one stage he was training with Southampton and Pompey five nights a week,’ says John, a barrister. ‘Then the inevitable happened – both clubs found out about the other. But it was always going to be Southampton because of the fantastic reputation of their academy and the quality of the coaching. Former Saint: Real Madrid star Gareth Bale came through the youth ranks at Southampton . Younger days: Theo Walcott, now at Arsenal, is pictured celebrating after scoring for Southampton in 2005 . Rise to stardom: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain came through at Southampton after joining their academy . ‘He flirted with cricket as something to do in the summer and he’s quite a competent tennis player but it’s always been about football for him. The first thing he did was kick. As soon as he could walk he had a ball at his feet and if we took that away from him he would kick his teddy bear!’ Ward-Prowse turned professional at the same time as Shaw and Calum Chambers – who joined Arsenal for £12m this summer – after making his first-team debut in October 2011. Although he made 19 appearances in all competitions following Southampton’s promotion to the Premier League and another 39 last season, many were as a substitute and he is determined to cement a first-team place under Koeman. The challenge now is to show that he can fill the gap left by Lallana. ‘It’s a massive season, probably the biggest of my career so far,’ said Ward-Prowse. ‘Last season was a bit of a struggle in terms of starts and it would be good to maintain a place throughout the year. ‘They are big shoes to fill and Adam was a fantastic player for the club and a fans’ favourite. Hopefully that is the sort of role I’m looking to take on myself.’ If Ward-Prowse continues at this rate, Saints fans could be waving goodbye to another young star sooner than they had hoped.

"By . Pa Reporter . Hull's one-club half-back Richard Horne has announced he will retire at the end of the season. The 32-year-old has been with his hometown side all of his playing life, having made his debut aged 16. Since then he has racked up 383 appearances for the Black and Whites, including a victorious Challenge Cup Final in 2005. Calling it a day: One-club man Richard Horne has decided to hang up his boots . Horne has earned Dream Team recognition in that time, while also making 12 appearances for Great Britain. 'It has probably taken about two to three months to allow me to get my head around the idea, but it just feels the right time to retire from playing,' said Horne, who will remain at the KC Stadium as an academy coach. 'If somebody had told me when I made my debut for the club back when I was just 16 that I would still be playing for Hull at 32, I would have laughed and then quickly snapped their hand off for the opportunity. For me to be able to live my childhood dream, what more could you ask for?' National service: Horne's form earned him 12 caps for Great Britain . The latter part of Horne's career had to be tailored after he was diagnosed with diabetes, while he also came back from a career-threatening neck injury in 2008. 'It has been an amazing 16 years, unfortunately though at some point you have to make this decision and it just feels like the moment has come for me,' he added. 'The decision has coincided with the club offering me this role within the coaching staff, which I am extremely looking forward to and I'm glad I am able to stay with Hull to take up this new challenge. 'Hopefully I will be able to have an equally long coaching career at the club as I have managed to achieve playing.'","Half-back ready to hang up his boots 16 years after making his debut .

"By . Flora Bradley-watson . and Charlie Lankston . The bad news is there’s no cure for a hangover. But that doesn’t mean the majority of us won’t wake up with one in two days’ time. Most will reach for painkillers and the coffee pot, but what of the other tried-and-tested remedies? Who better to consult than celebrities who need to ensure they not only feel better but look red-carpet-ready after a heavy night. Here we speak to the stars to discover how they cope the morning after the night before. Top tips: Nigella Lawson recommends her own recipe for Eggs in Purgatory, Nancy Dell'Olio goes for a strong cup of espresso whilst singer Katie Melua prefers a classic burger with HP sauce .

The old Soviet countries have some weird hangover cures, such as a raw egg swallowed in one and ‘sodium water’ drinks, but I’m not a fan of that so I prefer a full English breakfast or a dirty burger – really fatty plus plenty of chips, Coke on the side and HP sauce. LEN GOODMAN 68, Strictly Come Dancing judge . Drink at least a pint of water before you go to sleep. Always lock the wardrobe in case you confuse it for the bathroom. If on waking you are hung over, two pickled walnuts and a glass of Ribena will either kill or cure you. Take a brisk walk in the fresh air to the nearest pub and consume exactly 50 per cent of what you had the night before. This won’t fully alleviate the symptoms but you’ll definitely feel better. Also, a warning: with each two units of alcohol consumed, a person of the opposite sex gets ten per cent more attractive. Simple treats: Denise Van Outen's hangover cure includes the classic combination of a banana and a can of Coke topped off with a walk on the beach . NIGELLA LAWSON 52, cook . Try my Eggs in Purgatory recipe.

Light exercise later on such as a power walk, yoga or zumba can lift your mood.

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . It takes a brave model to hold a pose when an enormous whale shark is swimming just inches from her head. But for Roberta Mancino, it's just another day in the office. The model, who is also a professional skydiver and wing-suit flyer, spent 20 days swimming in waters near the northern Peninsula of Mexico in search of giant sea creatures - including the sailfish, the world's fastest fish. Roberta Mancino swims with a whale shark by Isla Mujeres near the northern Peninsula of Mexico . Pictured here with a manta ray, Ms Mancino spent hours in the ocean while Emmy Award-winning cinematographer and photographer Shawn Heinrichs took photographs . The model was particularly excited about swimming with the sailfish - the world's fastest fish can reach speeds of up to 68mph . The sailfish can grow up to nine feet long and has an elongated bill, resembling that of a swordfish . Ms Mancino poses underneath a whale shark (left) and above a manta ray (right) during a dive . Ms Mancino, 33, from Anzio, Italy, swam with whale sharks, manta rays and sailfish during two ten-day diving expeditions in February 2013 and February 2014. The trips took her near Isla Mujeres - a Mexican island famous for its abundance of large sea creatures. She had to spend hours in the water, holding her breath for up to a minute at a time, while being filmed by Emmy Award-winning cinematographer and photographer Shawn Heinrichs. The shoot was part of a broader series depicting marine life interactions that inspire ocean conservation. Speaking about the experience, Roberta said: 'It has always been one of my dreams to swim with the fastest fish in the ocean and to see how they hunt it's really exciting - eventually I would love to swim with all the coolest underwater creatures.

'It's hard to be prepared, even if you swim a lot before and do free-diving exercise, it doesn't help much when you are in the water - they are very fast. 'Under the water it was full of action and excitement the entire time, it is very challenging to find them and to reach them in time to get a photograph.' Ms Mancino has completed more than 7,000 skydives, four of them naked, and was named the World's Sexiest Female Athlete by Men's Fitness magazine in 2010.

"By . Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia . For those who love the marine wildlife - now is your chance to swim with the gentle giants and let nature take its course. The Sunreef Humpback Whale Swim Experience is an Australian first, giving tourists an opportunity to swim with the captivating whales in Mooloolaba, a resort town 100km north of Brisbane . The concept was conceived by Sunreef Whale Encounter Supervisor Dan Hart, who said Sunreef was excited to be offering this great experience on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast. Scroll down for videos . An Australian first, giving tourists an opportunity to swim with the captivating whales on Queensland's Sunshine Coast . It's a life changing experience - to have a humpback whale just a couple of metres away . 'I swam with humpback whales in Tonga and it is something very special,' he said. 'It was such a breathtaking and mind-blowing experience I thought it should be made available to more people. So I thought, why not start it here? 'It’s a life changing experience – to have a humpback whale just a couple of metres away looking you right in the eye.  It’s indescribable. 'It gives you such a sense of these amazing creatures and we are excited to be able to offer it to everyone.' Mr Hart said the swimming with whales experience was operated under a strict Code of Conduct to protect both the whales and the participants. The swimming with whales experience was operated under a strict Code of Conduct to protect both the whales and the participants . The experience is a three-hour round trip with a maximum of 20 participants on each trip. Mr Hart said Sunreef provide a full briefing on what to expect and safety procedures as well as providing all required wetsuit and snorkeling equipment. After a whale is sighted by the company's spotter plane, the boat will be put into neutral 100m or more away from the whale, and if the conditions are determined as safe by trained crew, the boat will be turned off and swimmers will be allowed into the water holding to the floating line attached to the boat. 'Then it’s all up to the whale – it is a natural experience and it is 100% on the whale’s own terms,' Mr Hart said. 'We have 100% success rate seeing whales and about 50% success rate in getting people in the water with them. 'Whales are known as curious creatures so they may come over towards us or they may just swim past or away.  Either way it’s an experience you will never forget.' Swimmers will be allowed into the water once a whale is spotted 100 metres away and they can hold the floating line attached to the boat . The whale-swimming experience is a three-hour round trip with a maximum of 20 participants on each trip . 'In our experience, the whales seem as intrigued by us as we are of them and often come close to swimmers, gliding effortlessly around us, with such a gentleness that its like they recognise our fragility in comparison and know we are there out of wonder and respect,' he said. 'Our first Swim with the Whales experiences will run from the 6th of July and we will continue to offer them throughout the season.' BBC reports given the issue’s sensitivity, Mr Hart spent two years consulting with wildlife officials, marine biologists and ecotourism experts to create an activity template that ensured swimmers' safety and didn't affect the whales. University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, environmental science lecturer Sheila Pyke said it would be a 'wow' experience when tourists hear the noises whales make and feel their vibrations in the water. 'When those people go home, many will speak out against whaling. But this year is very much going to be a wait-and-see for them to figure out if the trial has been successful,' she said. CEO Sunshine Coast Destinations Limited Simon Ambrose said he is excited to support Sunreef in this exciting Australian first humpback whale swimming experience.","Tourists will get a breathtaking and mind-blowing whale swimming experience .

"By . Becky Evans . A garden trough used as a flower planter for 30 years has been identified as rare 2,000-year-old marble coffin worth over £100,000. The unsuspecting couple from Northumberland inherited the 6ft 9in long sarcophagus from the previous owners of their house, who left it behind in 1982. The retired pair only realised its worth when they learned of a similar ornament on sale at an auction house. The owners believed their 'planter' - that had been used to grow flowers for 30 years - was not valuable, until they spotted a similar ornament on sale at auction and discovered it was worth more than £100,000 . Experts were invited to inspect it and discovered the one-tonne trough was a rare ornate Roman sarcophagus - a coffin carved from stone that usually sits above ground - dating back to the First and Second Century AD. Auctioneers said the couple were 'shocked' when they learned how valuable it is. Made from Carrara marble, the sarcophagus would have been commissioned for the funeral of a wealthy woman and placed in a private mausoleum in Rome. The sarcophagus is worth more than the couple, who asked not to be identified, paid for the home it was found in. The previous owners did not even mention the sarcophagus on the house deeds and clearly did not know its value. It is almost identical to another Roman sarcophagus that is in the Galleria Lapidaria in the Vatican. The 2,000-year-old sarcophagushas is made from marble and has been verified by auctioneers and a respected archeologist . The carved marble side features cherubs that represent charm, beauty and creativity in Greek mythology . The sarcophagus, which is expected to fetch a six-figure sum at auction, would have been commissioned for the funeral of a wealthy Roman . The front is carved with a central . panel of the Three Graces, which represent charm, beauty, and creativity . in Greek mythology. It is not known how it found its way to the rural house near Hadrian's Wall, but a copper plaque on the back of the sarcophagus states 'Bought from Rome in 1902.' Guy Schwinge, of Dukes auction house in Dorchester, Dorset, flew to Newcastle as soon as he saw the pictures of the sarcophagus the couple had emailed. He found the rare ornament filled with plants and soil and left on the grass. He said: 'It is quite exceptional for a something of this importance to turn up unrecognised in a garden. 'They told me that they acquired it when they bought the house and just thought it was an ornamental plant trough. Each end of the ornament features a griffin but the back is bare as it was intended to stand against a wall . 'The . people who sold the house didn't make a big fuss about it and it wasn't . mentioned in the deeds so they couldn't have know what it was. 'The . property is very close to Hadrian's Wall and the sarcophagus dates back . to Emperor Hadrian but that is purely a coincidence. 'It has always been in the same spot and the vendors have found it ideal for putting bedding plants in over the last 30 years. 'I think they were a little shocked when I confirmed what it was and how much it might sell for. 'After . I left they took great care in emptying the soil out of it and a crane . was brought in to place it on a lorry and drive down to us.' Mr Schwinge said although it is impossible to know for sure how the ornament made its way to England, a possible theory is that it was one of seven sarcophagi bought by US railroad magnate Henry Walters from the Palazzo Accoranboni gallery in Rome for $1million. Mystery surrounds how the sarcophagus made its way to England but a copper plaque on the back reads: 'Brought from Rome in 1902' Mr Schwinge said: 'It is interesting to speculate whether the sarcophagus we are selling could relate to Henry Walters' purchase.' Laurence Keen OBE, an archaeologist and art expert, who examined the sarcophagus, said: 'It was obviously intended for a high status individual. 'The combination of the strigilated panels and the figural decoration indicates that it was intended for a wealthy individual. 'The simply hewn back probably suggests that it came from a private mausoleum, where the tomb was placed against a wall.' The sarcophagus will be sold at auction in Dorchester on February 14. Details from an Ancient Roman sarcophagus . The Romans placed a lot of importance on funeral ceremonies as they believed without being properly laid to rest, the soul's of the deceased continued to roam. Wealthy Romans were given elaborate and ritualised funerals where homage was paid to their ancestors. Relatives would try to catch the last breath of the dying with their mouth - as that is where they believed the soul escaped the body from. The corpse was bathed and perfumed and coins would be placed under the tongue or over the eyes of the dead to ensure safe passage to the underworld. Funerals were held by torch light and at the front of the procession was a picture of the deceased. Cremation was most common and the ashes of the dead were kept in the family mausoleum but burial became increasingly popular. Sarcophagi became more common in the . Second to Fourth Centuries and were carved with scenes from mythology, . religious beliefs of hunting. A funeral pile was constructed in the shape of an alter and the nearest relative of the dead was tasked with setting it on fire. Poor Romans would bury the corpses if they could afford to or throw the body in a creek or river.","The Northumberland couple inherited 'planter' when they bought house .

"By . Peter Allen . A former Portsmouth Football Club player is among a group of 11 alleged Islamic convert terrorists arrested in France for targeting Jews. Yann Nsaku, 19, was a youth team centre-half at Pompey before he suffered a career-ending knee injury a year ago. The 6ft 2ins French passport holder, whose family is originally from Congo, returned to his hometown of Cannes, in the south of France, where he converted to Islam and is said to have become a violent jihadist, or holy warrior. Under siege: Armed police on operation in Cannes, southeastern France, where Nsaku was arrested at his home in front of his shocked parents . On Saturday, armed police swooped on his home in the seaside resort and arrested him in front of his tearful parents. At . one stage they had dreams of him becoming a Premiership player after . launching his career with Portsmouth, the 2008 FA Cup winners. But . coordinated nationwide raids on Saturday also saw Jeremy Sidney, a . 33-year-old friend of Nsaku, blasted to death in front of his pregnant . wife and children in Strasbourg, eastern France. Another . gunman called Jeremy Bailly was arrested in the Paris suburb of Torcy . as he carried a loaded .22 calibre rifle from a mosque prayer room. All . of the men were said to have been involved in a grenade attack on a . Jewish food shop in Paris on September 19th which saw one man injured. Their aim was to start a 'war across France', and to see a wholly Muslim state established in France, said a police source. Co-ordinated: The anti-terror operation was carried out in several cities around France, notably in Strasbourg where a suspect was fatally wounded . Nsaka, . who had spent short loan spells with other English clubs, and also . played for Cannes and the Congo youth team, was at one time tipped to . become the new Patrick Vieira, the former Arsenal and France World Cup . winner. Speaking . from the family home in Cannes, Nsaku's Christian father, Philip, . admitted that his son had become 'increasingly influenced' by Sidney and . converted to Islam soon after leaving Pompey. Mr Nsaku said his son had argued . furiously with other family members 10 days ago, and it has been a . 'constant battle' to keep him on the rails. Mr Nsaku said his wife 'collapsed in tears' when their son was arrested at home, but said that 'he had not become a bad boy overnight' and that 'for all of us, (his arrest) may be a salvation.' Crime scene investigation: Police leave the building in Strasburg, eastern France, where a man linked to the extremist Salafist group was shot dead . Police say that many of the young men arrested had made wills, and carried a list of Jewish groups they were targeting. All . the men arrested were said to be linked to a Salafist group which was . committed to waging a jihad - or holy war - across Europe. It follows Mohammed Merah, a 23-year-old French Algerian with similar Salafism connections, shooting seven people, including four Jews, dead in the Toulouse area in March. At least three policemen were injured in Saturday's Strasboug raid, while others received direct hits to their bullet proof jackets and helmets. Police have been on heightened alert since the attacks by Merah, who was himself finally shot dead by police. A police spokesman in France confirmed that Nsaku could be held for up to 96 hours and faced a range of terrorism charges, which would prolong his period in custody indefinitely.","Yann Nsaku, 19, held during nationwide terror raids in front of his parents .

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple has revealed it is working to expand the diversity of the hugely popular emoji characters for the iPhone. Following complaints that the current character set was not diverse enough, the firm said it was working with the standards body that controls them. Because Emoji have to be displayed on different devices, they are tightly controlled by the Unicode Consortium. Spreading like wildfire: The top trending word of the year so far is emoji ¿ small digital images (pictured) used to express an idea or emotion in electronic communication - which are used by millions of people in emails and on social media . Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online. However, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere. Japanese electronic messages and webpages, whose use is spreading outside Japan. Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means ""picture"" (e) + ""letter"" (moji). Icons are standardised, and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as a bowing (apologizing) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese curry, and sushi. Some emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could noww be added. At present the list of characters contains dozens of faces of people that appear to be white. However, only two of the symbols seem to be Asian and none are black. Since 2010 a basic list has been developed and maintained by the Unicode Consortium - a Silicon Valley-based non-profit organisation made up of major computer firms, software producers, user groups and others.It does this to ensure that different devices and mobile carriers can share a basic set. The latest disclosure came after Apple boss Tim Cook was emailed asking if the firm was going to address the issue. Apple's Katie Cotton replied, telling MTV: 'Tim forwarded your email to me. 'We agree with you. 'Our emoji characters are based on the Unicode standard, which is necessary for them to be displayed properly across many platforms. 'There needs to be more diversity in the emoji character set, and we have been working closely with the Unicode Consortium in an effort to update the standard.' Miley Cyrus joined the calls to make emoji more diverse . The diversity of emoji was also questioned in a petition posted to DoSomething.org calling on Apple to increase the ethnic diversity found within its emoji keyboard. 'Of the more than 800 Emojis, the only two resembling people of color are a guy who looks vaguely Asian and another in a turban,' it says. 'There's a white boy, girl, man, woman, elderly man, elderly woman, blonde boy, blonde girl and, we're pretty sure, [video game character] Princess Peach.' A petition suggested that emoji like these could be added to Apple's keyboard . 'But when it comes to faces outside of yellow smileys, there's a staggering lack of minority representation.' It added that the keyboard already offered a graphic showing a same-sex couple, and called on the company to present people with a wider range of skin tones.","Stars including Miley Cyrus have called for more diversity .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . and Sarah Griffiths . As the UK basks in a heatwave, a charity has found a way to put the sweat caused by the enjoyable results of the hot summer weather to good use - by turning it into clean, drinkable water. UNICEF has created the Sweat Machine that squeezes the sweat from people's clothes and then purifies the liquid to create drinking water. It was developed and built as part of UNICEF Sweden's campaign to raise awareness of the lack of clean water in many parts of the world. Children's charity UNICEF has created the Sweat Machine (pictured) that squeezes sweat from people's clothes, filters it and turns it into purified drinking water . Charity staff unveiled the machine during the opening of the the world’s biggest international youth football tournament, the Gothia Cup. Players and visitors were encouraged to  hand over their sweat-drenched clothes, or to accept the challenge of drinking a glass of water from the Sweat Machine. On average, one sweaty football shirt produced 10 millilitres of drinking water. While many people might be squeamish about the idea of drinking water derived from human sweat, the machine proved surprisingly popular, with a number of celebrities having a tipple. Swedish footballers Mohammed Ali Khan and Tobias Hysén were the first people to sample the refreshments on offer at the tournament. The campaign was designed to raise awareness of 780 million people's lack of access to drinking water. While many people might be squeamish about the idea of drinking water derived from human sweat, the machine proved surprisingly popular. Swedish footballers Mohammed Ali Khan (left) and Tobias Hysén (right) were the first people to sample the refreshments on offer at the tournament . Around 125 million children currently do not have safe water to drink and thousands die each day as a result. UNICEF works with governments and local organisations in more than 90 countries with the aim of giving every child access to clean water and toilets in schools and local communities around the world. Per Westberg of UNICEF Sweden, said: 'We wanted to raise this subject in a new, playful and engaging way. 'Our Sweat Machine is a reminder that we . all share the same water. We all drink and sweat in the same way, . regardless of how we look or what language we speak. 'Water is everyone's . responsibility and should be everyone’s concern.' The concept was dreamed up by the . charity, the Gothia Cup, creative agency Deportiv0 and celebrity . engineer Andreas Hammar, but the machine has its limitations. Mattias Ronge of Deportiv0, said: 'People haven't produced as much sweat as we hoped - right now the weather in Gothenburg is lousy.' 'We've installed exercise bikes alongside the machine and volunteers are cycling like crazy, but even so, the demand for sweat is greater than the supply.' There are no plans for the machine to be mass produced as the charity uses better solutions such as water purifying pills in places where clean water is in short supply. It costs £21 to buy 5,000 water purification tablets for people with no access to drinking water.","UNICEF's Sweat Machine squeezes the sweat from people's clothes and then purifies the liquid to create drinking water .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . People who are considered unattractive are more likely to be belittled and bullied in the workplace, according to new research. The study by Michigan State University found that unattractive workers were treated more harshly than their attractive colleagues when it came to promotions and which tasks they were given to do. And that being 'ugly' played more of a role in how someone is treated than their age, gender or how long they had worked there. 'Ugly' people are more likely to bullied and belittled by their work colleagues, according to a study by Michigan State University. The researchers found that unattractive people are treated less favourably than attractive members of the workforce . A study by the University of California-Berkeley discovered that flirting at work can help women get ahead. However, it makes them less popular and trustworthy than their colleagues. Women who use their feminine charms to get ahead are seen as less authentic and less genuine than women who refuse to flirt. And the distrust built up among colleagues could prove to be damaging in the long run, and counteract the leaps forward they make by flirting. Previous research has found that attractive students tend to be more popular in school. However, this study, led by associate professor of management at the University Brent Scott, is the first to find a direct correlation between attractiveness and bullying in the workplace. 'Frankly, it's an ugly finding,' said Scott. 'Although we like to think we're professional and mature in the workplace, it can be just like high school in many ways.' The researchers surveyed 114 workers at a health care facility in the southeastern United States. The workers were each asked how often their colleagues 'engaged in cruel behaviour' towards them. This cruel behaviour included saying hurtful things, acting rudely and making fun of them. A separate group of people, who didn't know any of study participants, were each shown photos of the workers and asked to judge how attractive each of them were. Workers that were rated as unattractive were treated much more harshly than those the separate group classed as attractive. The researchers asked 114 employees how often their colleagues engaged in 'cruel behaviour' towards them. This included saying hurtful things, acting rudely and teasing of them. The workers rated as unattractive by a control group were treated harshly more often than those considered attractive . This included being given menial tasks or jobs other people didn't want to do and being overlooked for promotion. And this was the case even when other key factors were taken into account, including age, gender and how long they had worked at the health care facility. The researchers also collected information on how agreeable or friendly the workers were, based on questionnaires completed by their spouses, partners or good friends. The study found that disagreeable workers, like unattractive employees, were treated more harshly than their co-workers. 'Our findings revealed that both personality and appearance matter,' Scott said. Knowing the potential targets of hurtful behavior could help managers monitor susceptible employees to prevent them from becoming victims or to provide counseling and social support if prevention attempts fail, he added. The results appear in the research journal Human Performance.","Researchers from Michigan State University discovered that 'unattractive' people are more likely to be bullied in the workplace .

In contrast, the British characteristic of self-restraint can have serious repercussions for physical and mental well-being. Angry: Scientists found that being fiery and expressing negative emotions is the key to long-lasting good health . Researchers at the University of Jena in Germany assessed more than 6,000 patients and found that those who internalised their anxiety suffered from a raised pulse. Over time this results in high blood pressure and an increased chance of developing a wide range of illnesses, from coronary heart disease to cancer and kidney damage. The research, by Marcus Mund and Kristin Mitte, was published in the journal Health Psychologies. It identified a group of so-called ‘repressors’ who were particularly at risk. ‘These people are distinguished by the way that they attempt to conceal outward signs of fear, and also by their defensive behaviour,’ Mr Mund said. Tests: Researchers at the University of Jena in Germany assessed more than 6,000 patients and found that those who internalised their anxiety suffered from a raised pulse . ‘They avoid risks and always seek a high level of control over themselves and their surroundings. 'Repressors are distinguished by the way that they attempt to conceal outward signs of fear, and also by their defensive behaviour' Marcus Mund, researcher . 'For instance, when exposed to a stressful task they exhibit a higher heart rate and pulse ratio than non-repressors and show other objective signs of stress and anxiety.’ But thankfully the news is not all bad for those of us who keep things bottled up. Although they might be at a higher risk of developing certain illnesses, recovery from a range of conditions appears to be faster among repressors. ‘Because of their need for control, repressors are very disciplined and more motivated to adapt their lifestyles,’ said Mr Mund.","Researchers at University of Jena in Germany assessed 6,000+ patients .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A family gathering to mourn the death of a relative were shocked to tears and fainting when the deceased man in question pitched up at his own funeral on Tuesday. In a bizarre case of mistaken identity, news of car washer Gilberto Araujo's murder had been relayed to the family by local police in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Sunday. Shortly after, when the wayward vagabond's brother was called into the morgue to make a positive identification on the body, he saw his brother lying on the table and took the corpse home so his family could hold a wake. Family and friends of Gilberto Araujo (right) had spent the night grieving beside his open coffin. But the body they were weeping over was that of a workmate (left) who relatives say looked uncannily like 41-year-old Gilberto . Jose Marcos Araujo was so fooled by the likeness of fellow car washer Genivaldo Santos Gama to his brother Gilberto, that he mistakenly confirmed the body to be his sibling's. Police inspector Roberto Lima said that Jose Marcos took the body to his mother's Alagoinhas home where a wake was held on Tuesday . 'The confusion started when news . started circulating that a car washer had been shot dead,' Jose Marcos' wife, Ana Paula, told the UOL Internet news portal. 'Police called my husband and told him that his brother had been killed and his body was at the morgue,' she explained. Mother's love: Gilberto Araujo's mother, Marina Santana, was shocked and overjoyed to see her son after a friend told the man that his family thought he was dead and he should go and let them know he was okay . Lima said the confusion was 'understandable.' 'The two men closely resembled each other and both worked as car washers,' Lima said adding that no further information on Gama was immediately available. According to Gawker, the family had not seen or heard from Mr Araujo in the four months before the vexing case of mistaken identity. A few hours before the Monday burial 'a friend of Gilberto's saw him walking down the street and told him that his family was mourning him,' he said. Relief: Family gather outside Mr Araujo's mother's home in Alagoinas, Brazil, after many fainted and ran away at the sight of the car washer walking into his own funeral on Tuesday . 'So he went to his mother's home to let everyone know he was very much alive.' When Araujo showed up at his wake 'some people fainted and others were so scared they ran away. It was a big shock,' family friend Maria Menezes told the G1 online news site. Gilberto's mother Marina Santana told reporters: 'I am overjoyed. What mother wouldn't be after being told that her son is dead and then sees him alive.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . As they prepare in the dressing room, only one of these bare-chested competitors seems to have a chance in the contest they are about to enter. For it is hard understand what the man at the back of this photograph is doing in the Israeli bodybuilding championships. Far from having a six-pack of toned abdominal muscle, his pale torso looks as if it has been more acquainted with six-packs of beer. Scroll down for video . What's he got that I haven't? The flabby man, circled, admires himself as a toned rival has fake tan applied . As he watches his rival having his fake tan topped up by an assistant armed with a paint roller, the man seems unconcerned that he lacks the same chiselled physique. Perhaps he is hoping that the judges will be too distracted by his snazzy white shades to notice his flabby tummy and unflattering ‘moobs’. The men were pictured at the 2014 Israeli National Amateur Bodybuilders Association Championships, held this week in Netanya. NABBA is the first and the original competitve bodybuilding association. Formed in 1950, NABBA's first Mr Universe contest was won by Steve Reeves, who went on to make over 30 Hercules movies. High stakes: The man will compete alongside these bodybuilders in Israel's national championships . Preparation: Contestants like this one spend a year sculpting their bodies for the three judging phases . Star-studded: Arnold Schwarzenegger has won the world championship of this event four times . Top bodybuilders who won the Mr Universe title include Reg Park, Bill Pearl and Arnold Schwarzenegger (four-times winner). There are nine branches of the NABBA council across the UK, and each holds an annual Mr & Miss Britain qualifier. The winners graduate to the European and Universe championships. Last year saw 151 athletes from 36 different countries compete for the title. Members have to be at least 14 years old, though younger competitors can apply to join with their parents' permission. Testing: The men and women have a 'front, back and side' line up, individual routine, and posing contest . Tense: Women in glitzy bikinis look fierce before they take to the stage to vie for the revered title . To win, they must succeed in the three phases. First there is a front, back and side in line up. This is followed by an individual posing routine, not to exceed one minute and 30 seconds. The contestants then stand in a line and compare poses. Tanning colour is only permitted at the discretion of the organiser, though most accept it as a given.","Photo behind scenes of bodybuilding contest reveals unlikely contestant .

"By . Rachel Reilly . It's long been known than a smelly pair of feet bears more than a slight resemblance to a block of ripe cheese, but scientists have taken this link to the next level by making cheese from a foot. Experts have made the stomach-churning creations using bacteria from the human foot as well as a belly button and even an armpit. Scientist Christina Agapakis and scent expert Sissel Tolaas gathered microbes for their project 'Selfmade' which recently debuted at an exhibition about synthetic biology in Dublin. Sissel Tolaas (left) and Christina Agapakis (right) have grown the stomach-churning variety of cheese as part of a project called 'Selfmade' which has gone on show in Dublin . Ms Tolaas said on her website: 'Selfmade is a series of ‘microbial sketches’, portraits reflecting an individual’s microbial landscape in a unique cheese.' The cheese is supposed to reflect the flavours of the humans they belong to. Like the human body, each cheese has a unique set of microbes that metabolically shape a unique odour. Tangy: The stomach-churning creations were made by experts who harvested bacteria from donors . Each cheese was crafted from starter cultures sampled from the skin of a different person. The bacteria included that harvested from an armpit (pictured), a foot and a bellybutton . There are eleven cheeses in the exhibition. Each cheese was created using starter cultures sampled from the skin of artists, scientists, anthropologists, and cheese makers. The samples of bacteria used in the cheese came from armpits, a foot, a bellybutton and tears and were taken using sterile cotton swabs. Ms Agapakis told Dezeen: 'Despite [their] chemical and biological similarities, there are obviously very different cultural and emotional responses to stinky cheese and stinky feet. Ms Agapakis said: 'By making cheese directly from the microbes on the body, we want to highlight these bacterial connections as well as to question and potentially expand the role of both odours and microbes in our lives' Ms Agapakis and Ms Tolaas say that their project explores synthetic biology through the practices of traditional cheesemaking . 'By making cheese directly from the microbes on the body, we want to highlight these bacterial connections as well as to question and potentially expand the role of both odors and microbes in our lives.' A short film was also created that explains the process of the human cheesemaking, along with interviews with the people who donated bacteria samples. However, the designers said that the cheese wasn't made to be eaten and instead has been created 'to inspire new conversations about our relationship to the body and to our bacteria.' There are hundreds of distinct cheese varieties produced around the world today, and all are made with varying recipes, techniques, and trade secrets.Despite all the varieties, they all undergo the same essential process. STAGE ONEAim: To produce curds from the protein found in milk . Milk is pasteurised and a bacteriological starter is added to ‘sour’ and thicken the milk. A renneting agent is added to the milk to form curds. Nowadays, most British cheeseproduced uses a non-animal renneting agent, making the cheese suitable for vegetarians. The curd is left to set. STAGE TWOAim: To concentrate the curd . The curds are cut so that the whey is released (soft cheeses are cut lightly while hardcheeses are cut finely). The curds are either ‘cooked’ or are piled on top of each other (the process known as‘cheddaring’), and further cut to expel whey. The curd is milled and salt is added (in some recipes salt is included by immersingthe moulded cheese in a bath of brine for several days). The curd is pressed into moulds. STAGE THREEAim: To ripen the cheese . The cheese is placed in storage rooms where temperature and humidity are controlledand varied according to the cheese being produced (Cheddar was originally stored inSomerset’s Cheddar Gorge caves). Mild Cheddar is generally stored for around three months, whilst Mature Cheddar is stored for up to a year. Cheeses have very individual storage processes that create their distinctive flavours and textures. During the first week of Blue Stilton’s storage, it is turned daily to ensure an even distribution of moisture throughout the cheese.

"By . Dan Bloom . China has seized a 119,000-tonne Japanese cargo ship in a dispute over a Second World War debt dating back 78 years. Shanghai impounded the 1,050ft-long ore freighter Baosteel Emotion after a court ruled Japan still owed £17million for two Chinese ships which were commandeered by the Imperial Japanese Navy and sunk. But the seizure on Saturday has sparked a diplomatic incident and led Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to announce: 'We are demanding China take appropriate measures'. Seized: The 119,000-tonne Baosteel Emotion has been impounded by China over a 78-year-old war debt . Dispute: Japan's Prime Minister hit out over the move, which some have seen as a Chinese show of strength . The dispute stems from the loan of two ships from the Chinese Zhongwei Shipping Company in 1936. They were rented for a year by a firm which later became Japanese shipping giant Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, the owner of the freighter which is now in dispute. But the ships were reportedly commandeered by the Imperial Japanese Navy and sunk during the Second World War, a time in which Japanese forces occupied large parts of China. China claimed the debt was never repaid, and a compensation claim was opened by the descendants of Zhongwei's founder in a Shanghai court 25 years ago. In 2007, officials ruled Mitsui had to pay compensation and the firm later lost an appeal in China's Supreme People's Court. Huge: The 1,000ft ship entered service as an ore freighter in 2011 for Japanese shipping giant Mitsui . Dispute: The location of the ship in the East China Sea, according to GPS mapping, puts it near Shanghai . The move marks an escalation of tensions between Japan and China, who have for decades been locked in a dispute over a small archipelago in the East China Sea. The Senkaku Islands - which are also claimed by Taiwan - were handed back to Japanese control by the U.S. in 1972 despite being far closer to the Chinese mainland. A series of lawsuits connected with wartime forced . labour have also been filed in China against Japanese corporations. Some see the latest move as a show of strength by China during U.S. President Barack Obama's official tour to east Asia, which will see him arrive in Tokyo tomorrow. Japanese politicians say the seizure . is against the spirit of a 1972 pact in which China said it would . no longer demand war reparations from Japan. Water under the bridge? Japanese PM Shinzo Abe claimed the move was against the spirit of a 1972 pact . Deadlock: The move marks an escalation of tensions between Japan and China, who have for decades been locked in a dispute over a small archipelago in the East China Sea which was handed to Japan in 1972 . Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said: 'We have told the Chinese side through diplomatic channels that we regret its seizure of the vessel... we demand China take appropriate measures.' The ruling could 'intimidate Japanese companies doing business in China', he added, and Japan was 'deeply worried'. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described the Chinese move as 'regrettable', adding: 'What's important is to observe the spirit of the rule of law.' But China said the civil case had nothing to do with the pact of 1972. The seized ship left the island port of Majishan at 7.20pm local time today and is now in the East China Sea near Shanghai, according to GPS maps. The huge freighter is only three years old and can carry a maximum cargo of 226,000 tonnes.","119,000-tonne ore freighter Baosteel Emotion is more than 1,000ft long .

Tania Clarence, 42, is accused of killing three-year-old twin sons, Ben and Max, and four-year-old daughter Olivia, who all suffered from a degenerative condition sometimes described as ‘floppy baby syndrome’. The mother-of-four, who was rushed into court covered in a fluorescent jacket, broke down when she saw her husband Gary Clarence, 43, for the first time since the deaths of their children. He flew home from his native South Africa yesterday after a holiday with their eldest daughter to celebrate her eighth birthday,  and was hugged by relatives as he . arrived in the public gallery. The couple sat feet apart during the two-minute hearing where Mrs Clarence sobbed uncontrollably as she struggled to confirm her name, address and date of . birth to magistrates. Mr Clarence blinked away tears and his hands shook as his wife was remanded in custody to appear at . the Old Bailey on May 9. Scroll down for videos .

Appearance: Tania Clarence being led into Wimbledon Magistrates court under a coat last week . The investment banker, who flew in from his native South Africa with eldest daughter, eight, locked eyes with his sobbing wife as she entered the court for the short hearing. The court heard how Clarence is charged with three counts of murder, victim one of age or older between April 20 and 23. Chair of the bench Fiona Abbott said: 'For these three charged, you will be sent to the Central Criminal Court for a preliminary hearing on the May 9'. Two uniformed police officers stood guard outside the courtroom and the public gallery was packed with press during the short hearing. Mr Clarence was escorted out of the court by police officers and driven away in a black taxi. He did not say anything as he walked down the court steps and through a scrum of photographers.A female police officer stopped traffic to allow Mr Clarence to be driven off quickly. Meanwhile murder squad detectives have removed more evidence from the Clarence family home after spending the afternoon looking for clues. Around 20 brown paper evidence bags were taken away from the scene in an unmarked police van just before four o'clock.

Pictured: Tania Clarence inside the prison van last week. Today she was remanded to a secure hospital which cannot be identified . Mr Clarence with his three-year-old twin sons, Ben and Max . Mr Clarence was said to be in a ‘state of shock’, and the family’s lawyers in Cape Town yesterday released a statement which spoke of him suffering from ‘tremendous pressure and strain’. It said: ‘The Clarence family have undergone and suffered an extreme tragedy with regard to their three minor children in the United Kingdom. This matter is an extremely exceptional one, with devastating consequences.’ The couple’s three youngest children suffered from the degenerative condition spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Mrs Clarence was said to be devoted to the children, giving up her career as a graphic designer to look after them. The family had spent almost a year renovating their home in New Malden to make it suitable for their disabled children – fitting a lift and ramps. Probe: Police forensic officers remove items from the home in south-west London where the children died . Police were called to the family's five-bedroom home in Thetford Road in the wealthy south west London suburb of New Malden at 9.30pm last Tuesday night where they discovered the bodies . A friend said that the three children had to be fed through tubes and their parents had to administer medicine hourly, which was understood to have put a huge amount of pressure on Mrs Clarence. And while the couple employed a carer and home help, they did not have round-the-clock assistance. Support: Businessman Kevin Clarence, Gary Clarence's brother, has accompanied him to London along with their mother and sister . The friend added: ‘Everything was regulated, everything they ate diarised. I bet Tania had not had a decent night’s sleep in a few years. ‘Gary is a businessman and had to travel. Tania has borne the brunt of it. 'Everybody who met her could not but be compassionate. Everybody complains about their kids but at least they’re healthy. It puts your life into perspective.’ Another friend said Mrs Clarence had complained that she found social services tended to be ‘judgmental’ when she asked for help. Officials took the attitude she should ‘get on with it and pull herself together’, they said. Friends of the family decided to alert the police on Tuesday after they were unable to contact the family for 24 hours. The children were discovered in their pyjamas in bed and are believed to have been smothered to death. Mr Clarence, 43, was seeing relatives in his native South Africa with his eldest child Taya Grace, eight – who is not affected by the illness – to celebrate her birthday when he heard about the devastating news. They both flew to the UK today along with his mother Anne and sister Derri Phillips, who accompanied him for support.

'In shock': Mr Clarence was with family at a home in Bela-Bela in his native South Africa when Scotland Yard called to inform him that his children had died . Friends said he had been struggling to come to terms with what had happened. A spokesman for the family told a South African newspaper: ‘Gary is absolutely in a state of shock – the whole family is. ‘He never would have left the UK if he’d known his wife would be left really battling.’ Poignant: Plants, candles and teddies were left outside the house in New Malden yesterday as the community reacted to the deaths .

Moved: A policeman lays flowers on behalf of grieving neighbour at the property in Thetford Road, New Malden . Moving: This message was one of many left at the house as the community paid tribute to the children who died . Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a disease sometimes called ‘floppy baby syndrome’ that affects between 5,500 and 6,000 people in the UK. It causes muscle weakness and progressive loss of movement as the nerve cells connecting the brain and spinal cord to the body’s muscles break down over time. Muscles used for activities such as crawling, walking, sitting up and moving the head become gradually weaker, but mental abilities remain unaffected. In the most severe forms of SMA, types I and II, fatal respiratory problems often develop early on and it is the leading cause of genetic death in infants and toddlers. Depending on its severity, children may need surgery, exercises and  equipment to improve mobility and breathing. There is no cure. SMA is caused by a faulty copy of a gene, which is activated when both parents carry it. Around one in every 40 to 60 people carry the gene. It can be tested for during pregnancy, although the test can increase the risk of a miscarriage. Joanna Mitchell, from the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Trust, said: ‘There can be terrible pain and it can be challenging for parents to look after children with the condition.’ A forensics teams has spent several hours in the house and post mortem examinations will be carried out .

Now you can find out using a new system that peers into the storm of activity in real-time. The technology, dubbed ‘Glass Brain’, was developed by neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley and Philip Rosedale, the creator of Second Life. Scroll down for video... It combines virtual reality, brain scanning and brain recording allowing the user to journey through their mind. The technology was recently unveiled at Austin's South by Southwest festival where the public were given the chance to look into the mind of Mr Rosedale's wife Yvette. Mrs Rosedale was wearing a cap covered with electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes that measure differences in electric potential to record brain activity. The structure of the brain is mapped using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The user then wears cap covered with electrodes that measure differences in . electric potential to record brain activity. This activity is revealed on screen. The different colours represent the . different frequencies of electrical energy in the brain, as well as the . paths by which that energy moves around. The Glass Brain can’t be used to show exactly what the user is thinking, but can paint a broad picture of brain activity. Prior to this, scientists had mapped Mrs Rosedale’s brain structure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The Glass Brain can’t be used to show exactly what the user is thinking, but can paint a broad picture of brain activity. A video of the brain recording was captured by the Neuroscape Lab at the University of California in San Francisco. The different colours represent the different frequencies of electrical energy in the brain, as well as the paths by which that energy moves around. The white areas are anatomical fibres. The technology could be used to help people with brain injuries make a faster recovery. ‘We've never been able to step inside the structures [of the brain] and see it in this way,’ Dr Gazzaley told Live Science. ‘It's biofeedback on the next level.’ Mr Philip Rosedale told LiveScience he foresees a day when two people could interact virtually in a way that reveals their inner state.

"By . Rob Cooper . Updated: . 00:40 GMT, 6 December 2011 . A young mother has told how she feels lucky to be alive after thugs hurled a 2ft slab of  concrete from a bridge on to her car. Lisa Horne, 26, was on a dual  carriageway heading home after Christmas shopping with her mother when the block slammed into her bonnet and shattered the windscreen. The incident last Thursday on the A12 near Brentwood, Essex, is being linked to another on the same road less than an hour later which left a woman fighting for her life. Lucky: Lisa Horne, left, with her mother Stella who was also in the car with her when it was hit by a concrete block. Both women astonishingly escaped uninjured . Police are treating both incidents as attempted murder. Mother-of-two Miss Horne said: ‘I was . very lucky to have walked away from it. If I had been travelling 1mph . faster it might have come straight through the windscreen and things . would have ended differently. ‘The police are right to describe it as attempted murder.’ She added: ‘I can’t understand how anybody could do something like that. They need to be caught to prevent it happening again.’ Weapon: This is the 1ft x 1ft rock which hit Lisa Horne's Vauxhall Astra when it was thrown from Fryerning Bridge near Ingatestone . Damaged: This is the Vauxhall Astra at the roadside after it was hit by the rock while travelling at 55mph. It damaged the bonnet and shattered the top of the windscreen but did not penetrate it so Lisa and Stella escaped uninjured . The second attack, less than three . miles away, left a 57-year-old passenger fighting for her life with head . and chest injuries. She is now stable in hospital. Meanwhile, police in Shrewsbury . launched an investigation after concrete blocks were dropped from a . bridge on to a road in the town. A West Mercia Police spokesman said: . ‘Fortunately, no one was hurt.’ Today Miss Horne spoke for the first time about her ordeal. She told a press conference: 'I . was running low on petrol so I wasn’t driving very fast. Scene: The attackers threw the rock from this bridge in Ingatestone onto Miss Horne's car. Police are now investigating 30 other incidents since 2008 . Feared death: Lisa Horne, 26, swerved across the road after the windscreen of her Vauxhall Astra was smashed by a block thrown from a bridge . 'It was as if someone had put their hands over my eyes and I heard a bang and my windscreen just shattered. 'It . was the loudest bang I’ve ever heard. I swerved across the road and . luckily I had my mum in the car. She said “Lisa get over to the hard . shoulder”. 'I couldn’t work out what had come off the bridge. A few cars went past and hit it.' Terrified: Lisa Horne and her mother Stella fear that if they had been travelling faster than 55mph on the dark road they could have been seriously injured. Miss Horne says she will no longer drive in the dark . Miss Horne added: 'The policeman who was . there said ""You’re very lucky to have walked out of this"". Somebody was . looking down on us that night. 'I’m scared it’s going to happen to someone else and I want them caught. I certainly won’t be driving in the dark.' She said: 'I cannot understand why someone would do that. I just cannot understand they are just not normal people to do something like that. 'It is not fair, you could have taken peoples' lives away and left my children without a mum.' Second attack: The interior of the Nissan which was hit by a second concrete block last Thursday on the same stretch of road. A 57-year-old woman is still in hospital after that attack . Smashed: The full extent of the damage to the Nissan car and shattered windscreen can be seen here. Police are treating both attacks as attempted murder . Her mother Stella told the press conference that she could not understand the mentality of the thugs who hurled the rock. 'I just don't know how they went home that night and slept,' she said.'They could have killed four people within half an hour. 'I just don't understand how people could do that. I cannot sleep thinking about it.' Essex Police say a 2ft block, which . smashed through the windscreen of the Nissan, may have been used as a bollard at a . nearby house. Scene of attack: Police on West Hanningfield Bridge over the A12, where the second concrete block was thrown onto a Nissan car . Officers are examining clues from  a . forensic examination of both bridges. Detectives are also looking into . more than 30 similar incidents from the past three years to identify any . links. The force has increased patrols in the area and is appealing for information from the public. Detective . Chief Inspector Keith Davies said: ‘Even a stone thrown from a bridge . can be fatal, but  when you look at the size of this concrete, it is . amazing that the consequences were not far, far worse.’ Appeal: Police and press at West Hanningfield Bridge in Essex after the second attack last Thursday. Police are calling on witnesses with any information to come forward . Last night the road was closed again after someone thought they saw someone throwing a block from a nearby bridge. However, after finding nothing suspicious during a search of the area, police later reopened the road. A spokesman from Essex Police said: 'This was a genuine report and we would encourage such calls. 'We . are sorry for the disruption. But motorists and the surrounding . communities understand that safety is of paramount importance as is . catching the perpetrators behind these attacks.' Danger area: The red pin at Ingatestone is the scene of the first attack . and the second red pin is the bridge at West Hanningfield. The blue pin . indicates where a suspected attacker was seen on Sunday but this has . now been discounted . Heavy weight: The bucket-sized piece of concrete dropped from the A12 bridge . Mindless: The concrete block was flung from West Hanningfield Bridge pictured .","Lisa Horne, 26, and her mother 'lucky to be alive' after walking away uninjured .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . How will the world look in 2025? A report says a pilot licence could be the new right-of-passage to adulthood, quantum teleportation will be possible and everything in daily life - from our homes to our newspapers - will be digital. That’s according to the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters, which has released 'The World in 2025: 10 Predictions of Innovation'. The report predicts the landscape of science and technology in just one 10 years by mining global patent data and scientific literature. A new paper by Thomson Reuters compiles 10 innovation predictions for the world in 2025, based on research done by analysts. In some cases, the analysts found a growing body of work that gave additional credence to the prediction. In others, the topic was still emerging . To conduct the study, researchers identified the top 10 emerging scientific areas based on an analysis of popular topics using Thomson Reuters Web of Science. They looked at global patent data in the Derwent World Patents Index to identify the top 10 patent fields with the highest number of inventions containing a priority date of 2012 and beyond. The resulting technology areas with the highest level of commercial and scientific research interest were then reviewed to identify hot spots of innovation that will lead to tomorrow’s biggest breakthroughs. ‘While we do not purport to own a crystal ball, we do have the next best thing: citations to scientific literature and patent content,’ said Basil Moftah, president of Thomson Reuters IP and Science, in a press release. ‘By analysing current research and development activity and commercial pipelines, we are shining a spotlight on some of the most exciting developments that will emerge over the next decade.’ And, to MailOnline, Moftah added that the hardest thing was selecting the final 10 predictions from numerous citations and journals. ‘The main debate around the room was deciding what the ten would be,’ he tells MailOnline. ‘There’s a lot of investment going on in science and technology around the world, as always there is a broad range and field of research going on in universities and institutions.' One prediction from the report is that solar power will become the largest source of energy on Earth by 2025. According . to the most highly-cited scientific research papers of the last two . years, the process of harvesting and converting the sun’s energy is . becoming much more advanced. Ultimately . they say it will be more than just a novelty for the environmentally . conscious; solar power will be used by the majority of the world's population . 1. Dementia declines . According to the report, 'Baby Boomers' will begin to reach their 80s, so more and more scientific research funds will be directed toward afflictions they may encounter. 2. Solar will be the largest source of energy on the planet . Methods for harvesting, storing and converting solar energy are so advanced and efficient that it becomes the primary source of energy on our planet. 3. Type I diabetes will be preventable . Modifying the human genome will become a reality, making the prevention of diseases such as type 1 diabetes a possibility. 4. The end of food shortages . Thanks to advancements in lighting technologies and imaging techniques, coupled with genetic crop modification, food shortages and food price fluctuations will become things of the past. 5. Electric air transportation will 'take off' Lightweight aerospace engineering and new battery technologies will power electric vehicle transportation on land and in the air. Micro-commercial aircraft will fly the . skies for short-hop journeys. As these new planes will be able to take . off and land in much smaller spaces, getting a pilot license could be . the new right-of-passage to adulthood in the 21st century. 6. Everything will be digital . From cars and homes that respond to your every wish and want, to appliances that think for themselves, to interconnected geographies, everyone will be digitally directed. 'Imagine the day when the entire continent of Africa is completely, digitally connected,' the researchers write. 'That day will happen in 2025.' 7. Petroleum-based packaging will be history . Cellulose-derived packaging, which is 100 per cent fully biodegradable, will become the norm. Petroleum-based packaging products will be no more. 8. Cancer treatments will have very few toxic side effects . Drug development will be so much more precise, binding to specific proteins and using antibodies to give exact mechanisms of action, that the debilitating effects of toxic chemicals on patients will be significantly reduced. 9. DNA mapping at birth is the norm . The evolution of nanotechnology, coupled with more widespread 'Big Data' technologies that incorporate data from many different people, make DNA-mapping at birth the norm, as well as part of one’s annual physician exam. This allows diseases to be identified. 10. Quantum teleportation will be commonplace . Although in 2025 humans won’t yet be able to teleport through space, a significant investment in and testing of quantum teleportation will be underway using other forms of 'exotic' matter, proving the concept to not only be possible but useful. One of the predictions to come out of the report is that electric planes might be so commonplace that getting a pilot's licence will be the new right of passage to adulthood, like how a driver's licence is today. Other predictions include that food shortages might be a think of the past thanks to genetically modified crops . ‘Personally the DNA mapping one was probably the most tangible, in my opinion, and the one that’s the most promising,' Moftah said, revealing his favoured prediction. ‘In ten years time it will become routine for DNA mapping through birth.' Elsewhere, the researchers also predict that teleportation testing will become common. ‘Thanks to the research that went into the Higgs Boson project, Scotty may soon be beaming things up,’ the analysts write. Scientific literature has apparently exploded around the Higgs Boson, with over 400 citations of the 2012 study. This, they say, is a key indicator that scientists will attempt more ambitious quantum teleportation techniques. The report also says that everything will be digital: ‘From the smallest of personal items to the largest continents, everything, everywhere will be digitally connected,’ say the analysts. This will be a result of improved semiconductors, graphene-carbon nanotube capacitors, cell-free networks and 5G technology. The evolution of nanotechnology, coupled with more widespread 'Big Data' technologies that incorporate data from many different people, make DNA-mapping at birth the norm, according to the analysts as well as part of one's annual physician exam. This allows diseases to be identified and some to be prevented . They also say type 1 diabetes might be be preventable. Advancements in biological molecule engineering will advance to a point where it will be possible to modify humans to identify and treat diseases. This field currently leads all areas of genetic-engineering patenting and has been identified as an emerging research front in the scientific literature. How many of the predictions come to fruition remains to be seen, but the bold estimates of life in 2025 are interesting to say the least. ‘Our purpose is to provoke debate among . the research community, the world at large, by showing them what is . really happening and sometimes it is slightly opaque in research and . science communities,' Moftah adds. ‘So we hope that this really drives the debate.’ Will solar energy be the largest source of power on the planet in 2025? The analysts say that methods for harvesting, storing and converting solar energy will become so advanced and efficient that it becomes the primary source of energy on our planet .","Analysts for New York's Thomson Reuters have made 10 future predictions .

"By . John Stevens for the Daily Mail . Price promise: Ed Miliband said he would freeze gas and electricity bills in the UK . The boss of one of the biggest energy companies has said it would be too risky to cut prices ahead of winter because of Labour’s threatened price freeze. Paul Massara, head of Npower, said the firm had not reduced fuel bills despite a slump in wholesale prices – as an election victory for Ed Miliband would see them forced to stick with the new tariffs for 20 months. Critics last night said it showed Labour’s price freeze promise – which it heralded as the key part of its drive to help struggling families cope with increased living costs – had backfired spectacularly. So far this year, wholesale gas prices, which make up nearly half of energy bills, have fallen by more than 50 per cent. But in a letter to the energy regulator Ofgem, Mr Massara, whose company supplies 3.5million households, said Labour’s proposal had made it impossible to lower prices. ‘The potential Labour price freeze has, of course, also complicated  all pricing decisions further,’  he wrote. ‘The political and media pressures at the moment make it more difficult to reduce prices and then increase them again next spring.  Then we are acutely aware that if the Labour party were to implement their proposed price freeze, we will be living with the consequences of our standard tariff price for a very long time and beyond the level of risk that we could manage in the wholesale market.’ He added: ‘However, I can assure you that we review prices regularly and assess our options on a monthly basis.’ The correspondence, which was written in June but has only now been made public, came after Ofgem wrote to suppliers asking why price drops had not been passed on to customers. Last September, Mr Miliband said he would freeze gas and electricity bills in the UK for 20 months if he wins the general election in May next year. The commitment is credited with keeping his party high in the opinion polls, although new research claims it has wiped billions off the value of shares in energy firms. And Conservative politicians last night said that bills are likely to be artificially inflated all through next  winter because of the proposed price freeze. Some City analysts had already warned that Labour’s policy would backfire, and the admission from the energy boss suggests they were right. Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover and Deal, said: ‘Clearly Ed Miliband’s policy has backfired and is driving up energy bills today at a time when people can least afford it. Instead of making things easier, they are making them worse. Paul Massara, head of Npower, said Miliband's promise had 'complicated . all pricing decisions' for energy bills. Wholesale prices have dropped . by 50 per cent but the company has not shifted its tariff (file picture) ‘Labour do not have an economic plan or credible policies. They are not fit to govern.’ Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, added: ‘People have not had a reduction in energy bills and will not get one because of Labour before they are even in power. If Ed Miliband is elected it will lead to energy shortages. Labour’s energy price freeze is a false promise, and before they have even had a whiff of power it has backfired.’ Last night Labour defended its policy. Energy spokesman Caroline Flint said: ‘All the energy companies have 101 excuses about why they won’t cut their prices, but if Npower are publicly admitting that they are keeping their prices artificially high and the Government is doing nothing about it, that shows exactly why we need reform of the energy market.’ Mr Miliband has previously suggested that a Labour government could possibly seek control over other markets, fuelling speculation that Labour might step in to regulate water, rail and petrol.","Paul Massara said firm had not reduced bills despite drop in wholesale prices .

"By . Andy Dolan for the Daily Mail . When Ian Carroll asked council contractors why they were herding Canada geese into a van at a park, he was not satisfied by their claim to be ringing the birds’ feet. Mr Carroll, 39, contacted the park ranger but remained unconvinced by his assurance the birds were being relocated to a country park - even after the ranger sent him a picture of them supposedly being released. So the postman, who is a member of a local animal rescue group, lodged a Freedom of Information Act request with Sandwell Council, which finally admitted the geese had been taken away and ‘humanely’ killed. Ian Carroll, 39, saw a council contractor herding Canada geese into a van at Victoria Park, Tipton, West Midlands . The park ranger told Mr Carroll that the geese, pictured, were being relocated to a county park. He later sent Mr Carroll a photo to prove it . The West Midlands authority has now admitted it removed and killed 220 Canada geese from parks in Tipton and West Bromwich in 2013 and 2014, using a licensed pest control firm. The removals including the geese and goslings filmed by Mr Carroll in Victoria Park, Tipton in summer last year. Mr Carroll said yesterday: ‘I can’t believe they could lie to me like that. We still haven’t found out how they killed them. They could have been shot, gassed or had their necks broken.’ He added: ‘I have spent the last 17 years rescuing swans and wildfowl in Sandwell who have been maimed by other animals thugs. But this action by the council is worse than all of these incidents put together. But Mr Carroll, a postman, did not believe the ranger's explanation and sent a Freedom of Information request about the geese, pictured, to Sandwell Council, which is responsible for the park . ‘The birds have been rounded up and killed during the molting season when they loose their flight feathers and were unable to get away.’ In large numbers Canada Geese can have a detrimental impact on their environment, producing large numbers of droppings which contain bacteria and phosphates blamed for polluting watercourses, and dispersing native species. Councillor Maria Crompton said a total of 150 geese were culled from Victoria Park and Dartmouth Park in 2013. Seventy geese were culled from Victoria Park this year. The West Midlands authority admitted it removed and killed 220 Canada geese from parks in Tipton and West Bromwich in 2013 and 2014, using a licensed pest control firm . The removals included the geese and goslings filmed by Mr Carroll in Victoria Park, Tipton in summer last year . She said: ‘I’m very sad we had to do this but people’s safety and public health are paramount. ‘We have done this as a last resort and as humanely as possible in response to repeated complaints and real concerns from park users, including parents of young children.’ She said the numbers of geese had ‘got out of control’, with more than 1,000 grazing in Sandwell’s parks. In 2012 it emerged that more than 11,000 Canada Geese had been culled from parks by Stoke-on-Trent City Council over the previous two years.","Ian Carroll saw contractors herding geese into van at Victoria Park, Tipton .

"By . Matt Barlow for The Mail on Sunday . Hugo Lloris admits he was wrong to risk his health by demanding to play on during a game when he had been knocked unconscious and has applauded new rules protecting footballers against concussion damage. The injury suffered by Tottenham goalkeeper Lloris last November proved the catalyst for changes in the Barclays Premier League this season which give doctors the right to overrule players and coaches where head injuries are concerned. There is also an independent doctor in the tunnel area to assist club doctors in making these decisions. ‘It is definitely a good thing,’ said Lloris. ‘We don’t have to play with our health and someone in the profession had the good sense to find something better. Scroll down for video... Lesson learned: Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris realises it was wrong to play after being knocked unconscious . Sparko! The France No 1 was knocked out after a challenge by Everton's Romelu Lukaku in November 2013 . ‘I was a subject of that and so it is easier for me to understand the decision. I realise now that I had taken a risk with my health. It will not happen again.’ Lloris was knocked out in a collision with Romelu Lukaku at Everton last season, but recovered quickly and insisted upon playing on, even though Tottenham’s medical team wanted him to be replaced. A week later, he was deemed not fit to play against Newcastle and manager Andre Villas-Boas was criticised for failing to protect his player. In the backlash, the Premier League decided it was time for change. It was not the only high-profile head injury in football last season. Lukaku was also knocked out and played on against West Ham, as did Robert Huth, playing for Stoke against Manchester City. There were other incidents at the World Cup, involving Uruguay’s Alvaro Pereira and Argentina’s Javier Mascherano, who both continued after being briefly knocked unconscious. Head's up! Spurs stopper has welcomed new rules protecting players from the dangers of concussion . Lloris explained: ‘When you are on the pitch you don’t want to leave the pitch, you want to stay with your team-mates and help them get the best result. Now the rules are very clear and it will be better for everyone.’ It proved an eventful season for the Spurs and France keeper, who committed his future to the club, agreeing a new five-year deal before the World Cup and signing it on his return in July. ‘The decision was made before the World Cup,’ said Lloris, who faces QPR today. ‘I had some good chats with the chairman about the ambition and future of the club. The conditions were good for me. Blurred vision:  Romelu Lukaku continued to play after a collision during last season's game with West Ham . ‘We found an agreement and I’m happy for that. It was about ambition, definitely, not money. I am a competitor and I know that in the Premier League it is difficult to get trophies because there are a lot of top teams, but I know Tottenham has ambition to grow and improve year on year.’ He added: ‘I think everything is done for players to improve at Tottenham. We need maybe some stability after two years with two managers and we have to work together, keep a good spirit in the changing room and get some great performances, because last season we know that we did not do enough against the top teams in the League.’ Mauricio Pochettino took over as boss from Tim Sherwood, who replaced Villas-Boas soon after the incident at Goodison Park. Prone: Javier Mascherano lays unconscious after being knocked out at the World Cup, but still played on . ‘He (Pochettino) has a good CV as a manager and as a player he was an international with Argentina,’ said Lloris. ‘I know him because he played in France and he has a good philosophy about football. Somehow we have to work together and go in the same way, keep our ambition high and try to improve.’ It’s not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football… There’s £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest scoring manager .

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Jack Wilshere thinks Arsenal will be brimming with confidence when they face Besiktas thanks to their comeback heroics at Everton on Saturday. Arsenal looked destined for defeat at Goodison Park after falling behind to goals from Seamus Coleman and Steven Naismith. The Gunners missed a host of chances in the second half, but their dogged determination bore fruit in the end as Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud scored in a dramatic final seven minutes to snatch a point. Confident: Jack Wilshere believes Arsenal's comeback against Everton will inspire them against Besiktas . On Wednesday, Arsenal face arguably their biggest match of the season when they host Besiktas in the second leg of their Champions League play-off. With the tie currently standing at 0-0 after the first leg, Arsenal need a win to make the group stages for the 18th consecutive time, but Wilshere is not worried about the prospect of failure. 'This was a fantastic point and now we have a big game on Wednesday and this will give us great confidence going into that,' Wilshere told Arsenal Player. Fighting spirit: Wilshere gets his pass away despite being surrounded by three Everton players . 'We have got great character, great togetherness and some leaders out there that keep us going. 'We also have great players to go with that. 'We never give up and at this level that is massive. We have always shown over the years that Arsenal are going to battle like mad right until the end. 'There have been a few games where we have been behind right until the end but have kept going.' Comeback: Giroud scored right at the death to secure a late equaliser for Arsenal at Goodison Park . All the pre-match talk had been about a possible venture into the transfer market for a defensive midfielder, but based on the evidence of this match, Arsenal are more in need of a top-class striker. Alexis Sanchez endured a torrid first half against experienced centre-back pairing Sylvain Distin and Phil Jagielka. His replacement Giroud fared little better for the majority of the second period, wasting three good chances to score, before he finally nodded in Nacho Monreal's cross in the 90th minute. Belief: Aaron Ramsey's first goal inspired an Arsenal turnaround and gives them belief they can challenge . Arsene Wenger, who may be without Giroud for Wednesday's game because of an ankle injury, admits Arsenal's finishing was not good enough on Saturday. 'Normally when you score two away from home, you should win the game,' the Arsenal manager said. 'We had plenty of chances.' Wenger must have privately been wishing Everton's number 10 was on his books. Romelu Lukaku had an outstanding game, muscling Per Mertesacker off the ball all match. The big Belgian gave the German, and Calum Chambers the slip to set up Naismith on a stunning counter which allowed the hosts to go in 2-0 up at the break. Chasing: Wilshere tracks back for Arsenal as he tries to win the ball back against Leon Osman . Naismith, who also scored on the opening day draw at Leicester, says it is a pleasure to play alongside a man he thinks can go on to become one of the best strikers in Europe. 'He is a good young guy with a massive amount of potential,' the Scot told Press Association Sport. 'I have even noticed a difference from last season and that is only going to continue over the coming years so I am sure when he gets to his mid-twenties, he will be one of Europe's best strikers.' Many were surprised when Chelsea allowed Lukaku to sign for Everton on a permanent basis after he scored 15 league goals on loan at the Merseyside club last year. Naismith thinks the £28million signing will be out to show the Blues what they are missing next week when they come to Goodison Park. 'I am sure there will be things he wants to prove to Chelsea,' Naismith said. 'It was a big money move to come here so I don't think he was a disappointment at Chelsea. 'There was a lot of quality players ahead of him at the time so we are just lucky we have him and hopefully next week he will have a good performance and really turn it on against them.'","Jack Wilshere hails the Everton comeback as fantastic point .

"By . Dr Michael Mosley . From spare tyres to muffin tops, hitting the gym is considered a guaranteed way to shift those unwanted lumps and bumps — but is it effective? Dr Michael Mosley believes gruelling workouts are not the secret to winning the battle of the bulge. In fact, he says it’s one of many misleading weight-loss myths that can cause some people to struggle to slim. Here, the renowned health journalist, who devised the popular 5:2 diet, explodes some of the most persistent fitness myths. MYTH: Exercise is a good way to lose weight . Believe it or not, it’s not true that exercise, whether walking or jogging, is a good way to lose weight. It can be, but only if you push yourself. Dr Michael Mosley says that exercise as a weight-loss technique is a myth . The problem is that fat is extraordinarily energy-dense. Each pound of fat packs in about 3,500 calories. The average woman eats about 2,000 calories a day, so that represents nearly two days’ worth of food. So how much exercise would you need to do to burn off 1 lb of fat? Well, if you are a woman weighing 10 st then you will burn about 100 calories running a mile. This means you will have to run about 35 miles to get through 1 lb of fat. You could do it in one go, which would be tough and possibly dangerous, or run an hour a day at a reasonable pace of 6 mph for six days. But even that doesn’t guarantee you will lose weight, as it assumes you won’t then compensate by eating more, which many people do. A recent Australian study took 45 overweight young women and split them into two groups. One was asked to cycle at moderate intensity for 40 minutes, three times a week, for 15 weeks. The other group did 20 minutes, three times a week, but alternated short, vigorous bursts (only eight seconds long) with gentle cycling. At the end of the trial, just as they had at the beginning, they had their body fat measured. The group doing the short bursts of vigorous cycling had lost an average of 5 lb of fat, but the group doing the moderate cycling put on an average of 1 lb of fat. The vigorous cycling probably worked better because of an after-burn effect, as high-intensity exercise revs up your metabolism and leads to the release of hormones like adrenaline, which burn fat. It may also be because vigorous exercise tends to suppress appetite. If you want to lose weight you need to control your calories, increase your general activity and make sure the exercise you do is intense. Exercise alone is unlikely to be enough. Scroll down for video . MYTH: Everyone gets fitter if they exercise . Before I met Professor Jamie Timmons at Loughborough University, I would have bet my bottom dollar that this statement was true. Now I know otherwise. Professor Timmons checked how strong my heart and lungs were by measuring my VO2 Max, which is a measure of how much oxygen your body can consume when you’re pushing yourself. The fitter you are, the higher the figure. Not everyone can get fitter by exercising . I then went away and did an intense exercise regime for several weeks. Yet when I repeated the VO2 Max, I got exactly the same score. I couldn’t believe it. Professor Timmons explained there is a huge variation in how people respond to an exercise regime and there is no guarantee of favourable results. This is backed up by the findings of a recent study in Finland. They asked 175 untrained, middle-aged men and women to do a 21-week fitness course. The volunteers either did weight-lifting twice a week, endurance training twice a week or a workout that combined strength and endurance training four times a week. The results were mixed to say the least. Some people’s fitness improved by an impressive 42 per cent, while others became less fit — their VO2 Max dropped by 8 per cent, a finding that had the researchers baffled. There was an even greater spread when it came to the strength exercises, with some people increasing theirs by 87 per cent and others performing 12 per cent worse than at the beginning. A number of studies have come up with similar findings. As Professor Timmons points out, there is a huge range in people’s responses to exercise — from super-responders at one end of the spectrum, to non-responders at the other. There are almost certainly genetic reasons for this. That said, exercise is always a good thing to do. While some people, like me, may not improve their aerobic fitness, they will benefit in other ways, such as the way they control their blood sugar. MYTH: Exercise in the gym lifts your mood . This is a widely held belief, but is it true? People who do lots of exercise, particularly long-distance runners, report feeling happier and plenty of people get a real kick out of exercise. The popular explanation for this is ‘endorphin release’. These are chemicals produced in response to stress. The trouble is that while increased endorphin levels have been measured in the blood of some people after they exercise, it doesn’t happen in everyone and it is unlikely the endorphins being measured could have created the euphoric feeling anyway. Endorphin molecules are too large to cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain. So exercise may not be quite as effective a mood booster as it’s sometimes claimed to be. The happy feeling we get while exercising is in fact due to the release of chemicals in response to stress . A 2012 study at Bristol University backs this up. It took 361 patients with depression and divided them into two groups. One group continued as normal, the other group doubled its exercise. At the end of a year, there was no evidence the exercise had improved their mood or led to less use of anti-depressants. As Dr Melanie Chalder, from Bristol University’s School of Social and Community Medicine, acknowledged: ‘Our intervention was not an effective strategy for reducing symptoms.’ There is much more evidence to suggest just being outdoors in a green environment will have a positive impact on mood. Being in a natural setting is closer to how our remote ancestors would have lived. So remember, going for a run or walk in the park is more likely to cheer you up than doing the same exercise in a gym. MYTH: If I work out, I can eat lots more . Thanks to our evolutionary past, when food was scarce and our ancestors were active, our bodies are incredibly efficient at doing things like walking or running. You have to do a lot of either to burn even a small amount of calories. Working out doesn't mean you can eat more food without gaining weight . I researched how many calories I burn while running by wearing special monitoring equipment and set off at a brisk pace around the athletics track at Loughborough University. The equipment suggested I was burning about 16 calories a minute, which meant that having run just over a mile I had got through 160 calories. However, a latte contains about 150 calories, while a chocolate muffin comes in at 500 calories. So if you decide to have a relatively small snack like a muffin and latte after your run, you are topping yourself up with 650 calories — far more than what you’ve burnt off. And it gets worse. When you are judging the impact of going for a run, you should take into account the fact that you burn a lot of calories just sitting down and doing nothing. In fact, most of the calories we burn are consumed keeping our bodies going. What you want to know is not the total calorie burn (TCB) but the net calorie burn (NCB), that is how many extra calories you burn by running rather than doing nothing. To calculate your net calorie burn from running a mile at a reasonable pace i.e. doing 6 mph, or walking at about 3 mph, then use this formula: . Net calorie burn from running a mile at about 6 mph = 0.7 x your weight (in lb). Net calorie burn for walking a mile at about 3 mph = 0.4 x your weight (in lb). I weigh 168 lb, which means my net calorie burn from running a mile is about 117 calories. So 117 calories a mile means I would have to run nearly six miles to burn off a muffin and latte. Or I could walk nine miles. Best to leave that muffin alone.","Dr Michael Moseley, creator of the 5:2 diet, busts some of our most popular fitness myths ."

Mary Berry has discovered that baking is her genes - after learning her great-great-grandfather was a baker fora 19th century workhouse . Mr Houghton - a relation on Mrs Berry's mother's side - supplied the workhouse with between 700 and 800 loaves daily, although a local newspaper report from an inspector at the time claimed it was 'so bad that we don't know how to eat it', the Sunday Times reports, although this was later retracted. Mrs Berry, 79, also researched her paternal family and discovered that her great-great-great grandfather Christopher Berry was a printer and bookseller. But after he was hit by bankruptcy in the 1811, his wife Mary and six of their children were sent to the workhouse. Only two of the children - her great, great grandmother, also called Mary, and Chris - were spared the workhouse. A picture of Mary and her brother balanced on their mother on a makeshift see-saw, in 1938.

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . Hospital bosses have today blamed an Eastenders storyline for missing targets to see women they suspect have breast cancer. The waiting time to see a specialist has doubled for some patients in the five months since January from the target of two weeks rising to four. Watford General Hospital saw just 32 per cent of women with symptoms related to breast cancer within the two-week target in May. The storyline featuring character Carol Jackson finding a lump and developing breast cancer as well as her children and brother being tested for the faulty BRCA gene began in December. Bosses at Watford General Hospital have blamed the Eastenders storyline featuring character Carol Jackson's battle with breast cancer, for missing targets to see women they suspect have the disease . The storyline, featuring actress Lindsey Coulson, pictured in character, began in December and has caused a surge in the number of women seeking medical help over concerns they have the disease . The West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust’s chief executive, Samantha Jones, partly blamed its worsening performance on the soap's story line. The department has a capacity of 70 new referrals a week but has seen that number rise by almost a third to 95 new cases a week. NHS guidelines state that 93 per cent of patients with symptoms of the deadly disease must be seen within 14 days of being referred by their GP. Figures showed from April to December last year the trust hit the target most months. However since January it has not hit the target and by May the number being seen within two weeks had slumped to just 32 per cent. The longest wait for a woman displaying potential signs of breast cancer was between three and four weeks. Ms Jones, chief executive of the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'We would like to apologise to any patients who have had to wait longer to see a cancer specialist than they should have done.

'In common with many other trusts we have seen a growing demand for our cancer services over the past year, and a particularly significant increase in referrals for cancer over the last few months, which has been linked in part to a storyline in the TV soap EastEnders. 'To meet this extra demand we have put together a comprehensive cancer plan to ensure that, by October, we are meeting all the national cancer standards and providing a much improved experience for our patients and their families.

"By . Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail . Stroke patients admitted to hospital at the weekend could have a higher risk of dying on badly staffed wards, new research suggests. A study of 56,000 patients found a huge disparity in the number of nurses working on stroke units at weekends. The worst staffed wards saw an extra death for every 25 patients within a month of admission, the data shows. The research, carried out by specialists from the Royal College of Physicians and five British universities, found a five-fold difference in weekend staffing between the best and worst hospitals. Stroke patients admitted to hospital at the weekend could have a higher risk of dying wards with fewer nurses, new research suggests . While the best stroke units had five nurses for every ten patients, the worst-staffed had just one nurse monitoring ten people. The study, which used data from 103 English stroke units over 18 months, found that death rates are directly related to the number of nurses on the ward. Remarkably, the researchers found specialist doctors did not have the same impact on mortality. There was no significant difference in death rates in units where consultants did weekend rounds and those where they did not, according to the data, which was collected in 2011 and 2012. But the study suggests that nurses - who are more likely to spot problems with eating or breathing - are vital to life expectancy. Taking the average figures for all 103 hospitals, the researchers found only a ‘borderline’ difference between the death rates for patients admitted on weekends and those admitted on weekdays. But they said that picture ‘masked’ a huge variation between different stroke units - with poorly-staffed wards seeing rising mortality for weekend patients. The paper, published last night in the journal PLOS Medicine, reports that patients admitted at weekends to a well-staffed ward, with three nurses for every ten patients, had an 11.2 per cent chance of dying within a month. That death rate rose to 15.2 per cent on stroke wards with 1.5 nurses for ten patients, meaning an extra death for every 25 patients. The authors wrote: ‘Patients admitted on a weekend to a stroke unit with below-average nurse/bed ratios had a higher risk of death than those admitted on a weekday. ‘By contrast, weekend admission to a stroke unit with above-average nurse/bed ratios was not associated with an excess of mortality task compared to patients admitted during a weekday.’ The NHS recently issued new guidelines advising hospitals to provide a nurse for every eight patients on general wards, but there is no guidance on how many nurses should work on specialist wards covering specific problems such as strokes. The survey of 56,000 stroke patients in the UK found the worst staffed wards saw an extra death for every 25 patients within a month of admission . Study author Dr Ben Bray, of the Royal College of Physicians, said: ‘We found a strong relationship between the number of nurses working on a weekend and the risk of a patient dying after a stroke. ‘It is up to individual hospitals to review their staffing levels and for policy makers to look at this sort of evidence and point to what they think would be minimum levels of nurses.’ Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said the disparity was unacceptable. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘NHS Emergency stroke units are open seven days a week and provide excellent care. ‘Getting staffing levels right is a key priority for hospitals, but we understand it can’t be achieved overnight. 'Progress has been made and the addition of 6,300 more nurses on hospital wards since 2010 is making a big difference.’ ‘This is further evidence of the vital importance of having proper nurse staffing levels to ensure good patient care,’ he said. ‘If a hospital has enough nurses in place, stroke patients are more likely to survive and to recover. ‘It is unacceptable that stroke patient mortality rates are higher at weekends when staffing levels tend to be lower. ‘Driving up standards of patient care in the NHS requires commitment to investing in the nursing workforce. 'We’re worried that this isn’t happening and that there remains much more work to do in providing safe staffing levels for every health setting.’ Nikki Hill, deputy director of external affairs at the Stroke Association, added: ‘Nurses are a vital part of the specialist stroke team, helping more people survive and thrive after stroke. 'Stroke is a medical emergency, so stroke survivors should have access to the best levels of specialist diagnosis and treatment seven days a week. ‘Correct staffing levels of specialist stroke nurses play a key role in ensuring that no one dies needlessly of stroke.’","Study of 56,000 stroke patients found huge disparity in number of nurses working on stroke units at weekends across UK hospitals .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . One of England's leading children's hospitals has been deemed to 'require improvement' by health inspectors. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said Alder Hey Children's Hospital - one of the busiest in Europe - was falling down in its care for critically ill youngsters. The Liverpool-based hospital, which cares for more than 270,000 children from across the north west, North Wales, and the Isle of Man every year, has been told to improve its safety and responsiveness. Inspectors  found the wards were not always staffed properly and there were long waiting times for outpatients. CQC inspectors have told bosses at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool to improve safety and responsiveness after noting wards were not always staffed properly, when they visited the hospital in May . Inspectors concluded the hospital - one of the busiest in Europe - was falling down in its care for critically ill youngsters . In the high  dependency  unit there were not enough senior doctors to ensure that all risks were always safely managed, they said. But the trust responsible for the hospital,  Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust, was rated as 'outstanding' and 'good' in other key areas including end-of-life care and surgery. Alder Hey  is one of four dedicated children's hospital trusts in the UK. As well as caring for youngsters  in the north west it also offers specialist care to  children  from across the country. Inspectors visited the trust in May and gave each of its core services Ofsted-style ratings. Critical care, transitional services and outpatient care were deemed to 'require improvements'. The CQC also said that overall the  safety, responsiveness and leadership at the trust needed to improve. But overall the inspectors found that the services were 'effective and caring'. However, CQC has ordered the organisation to make a number of  improvements  including to address staffing shortfalls, ensuring children in the high dependency unit receive one-to-one care when required, improve access to record in the outpatients department and ensure safe medicine administration procedures are adhered to. CQC chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards, said: 'We came across numerous examples of staff going the extra mile to care for and treat children and young people in a highly personalised and sensitive way. 'Patients and relatives praised the staff for the commitment they showed to their work. Despite their concerns, the CQC overall found the services were 'effective and caring'. (File picture) 'However, I am concerned that shortages of nurses in some departments may affect patient care. 'While there have been moves to improve the recruitment process, the trust must continue to make this a priority. 'Our judgement is that this is a good hospital in many ways - but the issues which we have identified are preventing it from achieving excellence. 'The trust has told us it is taking action - I hope and expect to return in due course to find that the problems have been addressed.' 'Our judgement is that this is a good hospital in many ways - but the issues which we have identified are preventing it from achieving excellence' - CQC chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards . Louise Shepherd, chief executive of Alder Hey Children's Hospital, said: 'We are reassured that the CQC did not highlight any issues that we weren't already aware of and aiming to improve upon, some of which have now been resolved. 'In the last year we have invested over £1million in additional nursing staff and 37 new nurses have been appointed just this month. 'We have also worked hard to improve communication and engagement with staff, the availability of clinical records, administration of medicines, incident management and medical leadership. 'Alder Hey has been delivering pioneering healthcare and treatment for the last 100 years and our new hospital, which opens next year, will provide an exciting opportunity to enhance our role as a leader in children's healthcare.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Scientists are frantically looking for new ways to combat global warming. And now a team has created a sponge that absorbs carbon dioxide, which many scientists say plays a key role in heating up our planet. They believe that the polymer – a large molecule used in plastics - could bridge the gap between the use of fossil fuels and new energy sources such as hydrogen. Scientists have created a sponge that absorbs carbon dioxide. They believe that the absorbent material could bridge the gap between the use of fossil fuels and new energy sources such as hydrogen and could be easily integrated into smokestacks in the future (illustrated) The material - a relative of the plastics used in food containers - could be integrated into power plant smokestacks in the future. Speaking at the 248th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), Dr Andrew Cooper of Liverpool University said: ‘The key point is that this polymer is stable, it’s cheap and it adsorbs CO2 extremely well. ‘It’s geared toward function in a real-world environment. In a future landscape where fuel-cell technology is used, this adsorbent could work toward zero-emission technology.’ Carbon dioxide adsorbents are most commonly used to remove the greenhouse gas pollutant from smokestacks at power plants where fossil fuels like coal or gas are burned. But Dr Cooper says that the new material would be a part of an emerging technology called an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), which can convert fossil fuels into hydrogen gas. Many scientists think that hydrogen has great potential for use in fuel-cell cars and electricity generation because it produces almost no pollution. Carbon dioxide adsorbents are most commonly used to remove the greenhouse gas pollutant from smokestacks (pictured) at power plants where fossil fuels like coal or gas are burned. But Dr Cooper says that the new material would be a part of an emerging technology which can convert fossil fuels into hydrogen gas . The material, which is a brown, sand-like powder, is made by linking together many small carbon-based molecules into a network. It is very stable and can withstand being boiled in acid, proving it should tolerate the harsh conditions in power plants where carbon dioxide adsorbents are needed. It can absorb carbon dioxide without taking on water vapour, which can clog up other materials and make them less effective. The new 'sponge' is cheap compared to other absorbents. The material is robust, would have a long lifetime and could even be reusable. IGCC is a bridging technology that is intended to jump-start the transition to hydrogen fuel, while still using the existing fossil-fuel infrastructure. The IGCC process yields a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide that must be separated. Dr Cooper says that the sponge works best under the high pressures necessary for the IGCC process. Just like a kitchen sponge swells when it takes on water, the adsorbent swells slightly when it soaks up carbon dioxide in the tiny spaces between its molecules. When the pressure drops the adsorbent polymer deflates and releases the gas, which they can then collect for storage or convert into useful carbon compounds. The material, which is a brown, sand-like powder, is made by linking together many small carbon-based molecules into a network. One advantage of using polymers is that they tend to be very stable. The material can even withstand being boiled in acid, proving it should tolerate the harsh conditions in power plants where carbon dioxide adsorbents are needed. Another advantage of the new polymer is its ability to adsorb carbon dioxide without taking on water vapour, which can clog up other materials and make them less effective.  Its low cost also makes the sponge polymer attractive. ‘Compared to many other adsorbents, they’re cheap,’ Dr Cooper said, who explained that the carbon molecules they are made from are inexpensive. ‘In principle, they’re highly reusable and have long lifetimes because they’re very robust,’ he added. Dr Cooper believes that it would be relatively simple to embed the spongy polymers in the kinds of membranes already being evaluated to remove carbon dioxide from power plant exhaust.","Absorbent material could bridge the gap between the use of fossil fuels and new energy sources such as hydrogen .

"By . Mark Prigg . Pygmies developed their small size to allow them to travel through the rainforest easily, researcher have claimed. They say the small body size associated with the pygmy is probably a selective adaptation for rainforest hunter-gatherers. However, they say that all African pygmys do not have the same genetic change, suggesting a more recent adaptation than previously thought. A Ugandan pygmy hunts monkeys in Semili national park in Bundibugyo district. Researchers say that all African pygmys do not have the same genetic change, suggesting a recent adaptation. A phenotype is the outward expression of genetic makeup and while two individuals with the same phenotype may look alike, their genes may differ substantially. The pygmy phenotype exists in many parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, the Philippines and potentially in South America. The phenotype is usually associated with rainforest hunter-gathers, groups of people who do not farm, but obtain resources by hunting large and small animals and gathering fruit, nuts, insects and other available resources . 'I'm interested in how rainforest hunter-gatherers have adapted to their very challenging environments,' said George H. Perry, assistant professor of anthropology and biology, Penn State. 'Tropical rainforests are difficult for humans to live in. It is extremely hot and humid with limited food, especially when fruit is not in season.' Perry and colleagues looked at the genetics of the Batwa rainforest hunter-gatherers of Uganda and compared them to their farming neighbors, the Bakiga, with whom they traditionally traded forest products for grain, and sometimes intermarry. The researchers also looked at the Baka rainforest hunter-gatherers and their farming neighbors the Nzebi/Nzime in central Africa. They report their results in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science. The average height for Batwa men is five foot and for women it is four foot eight inches. Their short stature is not caused by a single genetic mutation as occurs in many forms of dwarfism, but is the result of a variety of genetic changes throughout the genome that influence height. Researchers say the small body size associated with the pygmy is probably a selective adaptation for rainforest hunter-gatherers . The researchers investigated 16 different genetic locations that were associated with short stature when they looked at individuals who were an admixture of Batwa and Bakiga. Several of these regions contained genes known to be involved with growth in humans. They then studied these regions to look for indications that the changes were ones that persisted because they were adaptive. Short stature may be adaptive for rainforest individuals for a variety of reasons, according to Perry. Small bodies require less food, which is adaptive for a food-limited location like the rainforest. Small bodies also generate less heat, which, in the heat and humidity of the rainforest, is adaptive. It is also easier for small, agile individuals to move through dense undergrowth and to climb trees.","Diminutive height is selective adaptation for rainforest hunter-gatherers .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . Greedy holidaymakers eat more than double their daily calorie allowance in the first 24 hours of an all-inclusive break, a new study has found. British tourists gorge on an average of 5,756 calories on their first day away, making the most of the food and drinks included in their package holidays, researchers said. The binge eating amounts to twice the recommended daily intake for both men and women and would provide enough fuel for a holidaymaker to run more than two marathons. NHS guidelines dictate the average man needs around 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight, while the average women should consume 2,000 calories each day. Greedy holidaymakers consume more than double their daily calorie allowance in the first 24 hours of an all-inclusive holiday, a study has found (file picture) A study carried out by CheapHolidayLand.com quizzed a focus group about their eating and drinking habits while on holiday. Respondents claimed their day of eating would start with a bowl of cereal followed by a full English breakfast downed with an orange juice and either a cup of tea or coffee – amounting to 1,117 calories in total. After breakfast many said they would move on to their first alcoholic drink of the day, adding another 240 calories to their daily total. Many holidaymakers confessed to often opting for a cooked lunch on their first afternoon. BREAKFAST: 1,117 CALORIES .

The vast majority admitted that they almost instantly fell into the trap of thinking everything is free and gorged themselves on the first day. Dinner proved to be no exception with many returning to the buffet table three or even four times. Researchers calculated that more than 2,000 calories were consumed at dinner on average. At 1,418 calories, alcohol accounted for a quarter of the total number of calories consumed on the first day. One person who took part in the study said: ‘I make the same mistake every time I go on an all-inclusive holiday. 'I fool myself into thinking everything’s free when in fact I’ve already paid for it. Many respondents confessed that they often opted for a cooked lunch on the first afternoon of their all-inclusive holidays (file picture) ‘Because I think it’s all free I just gorge myself stupid on everything from tea and coffee to gin and tonic.’ Another added: ‘I’m always bemused why I come back a stone heavier from all inclusive holidays, then I tot up everything I’ve eaten and the penny drops. ‘I really don’t know how I can eat that much when I’m abroad, I never stuff myself with that much when I’m here.' A spokesperson for CheapHolidayLand.com added: ‘It’s staggering to think how much we will feast on during an all-inclusive holiday. ‘Often people will binge on the first day and then rein themselves back in for the remainder of the holiday.’","Holidaymakers consume 5,756 calories on first day of all-inclusive trips .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Chased by a pack of sheepdogs, a three-month- old bear cub became separated from her family and found herself alone. Unable to feed or fend for herself, Zoe may have died if she was not rescued by a charity and brought to a bear sanctuary in Greece. There, the orphaned bear is learning the basics to survive in the wild so she can one day roam the hills again. Unable to feed or fend for herself, Zoe may have died if she was not rescued by a charity and brought to a bear sanctuary in Greece . Experts at Arcturos Bear Sanctuary in Kastoria, north Greece, tried in vain to reunite the badly dehydrated young cub with her mother and are now teaching Zoe survival skills from a distance. Philip Mansbridge, CEO of UK charity Care for the Wild International, which helps fund the sanctuary, explained: ‘At her age, Zoe really isn't equipped for being alone so being rescued has probably saved her life. ‘The next step though is to train her so she can feed and fend for herself in the hope that she will be able to go back into the wild later this year.’ Since her arrival, Zoe has been kept in a fenced area with no human contact other than her two carers, a worker at the sanctuary told MailOnline. When she was a cub, Zoe was fed five times a day, then four when she got stronger. When she is fully grown she will receive just one large meal a day. The feeding process takes place in such a way that Zoe is encouraged to search for food. The fruit and nuts and vegetables, food that she will be able to find when she will be released, is not given directly to her, but it is hidden in different spots in her enclosure. Here, she discovers apples tucked behind a rock . Experts at Arcturos Bear Sanctuary in Kastoria, north Greece, tried in vain to reunite the badly dehydrated young cub with her mother and are now teaching Zoe (pictured) survival skills from a distance . Around 350 brown bears live in the northern parts of Greece, in one of the biggest populations of bears in southern Europe. The main threats to them are humans as well as loss of habitat. They . come into contact with humans relatively rarely because they are found . only in the forests of central and northern Pindos and the Rhodope . massif in the north of Greece. There are usually around 10 bears at the sanctuary in Kastoria, north Greece, at any one time. They . are usually orphaned cubs or ex captive bears from zoos or circuses. Some have been rescued from the dancing bear trade, which the sanctuary . was instrumental in getting banned. This week it is hoped that Zoe will be released into a larger enclosure in the forest where she will regain some of her independence and can be trained before her final release at the end of the year. ‘The feeding process takes place in such a way that she is encouraged to search for food. 'The fruit and nuts and vegetables, food that she will be able to find when she will be released, is not given directly to her, but it is hidden in different spots in her enclosure. 'This way Zoe is forced to search for her own food,’ the sanctuary worker explained. Zoe will be able to forage for wild berries and nuts in her new enclosure, which grow on bushes and trees there, preparing her for life in the wild. At the moment, Zoe sleeps in a den made by staff at the sanctuary and there will be a similar one built in the wild for her when she is released, so she has somewhere cosy to sleep during the winter, when bears are lethargic.

Here, two slightly larger bears are housed in a big enclosure . Zoe has been living at Arcturos Bear Sanctuary in Kastoria, north Greece (shown on the map) with other orphaned bears and those that were kept in homes or circuses . The worker said that Zoe is independent and strong. ‘From the first day of her arrival she made it clear that she wouldn’t care for hugs and lots of play with humans. She got used to the milk formula very quickly and every time we introduced her to any new type of food she would try it right away! ‘She is very heavy and tall now, and she is ready for the next step.’ Releasing brown bear cubs like Zoe back into the wild is a difficult and dangerous thing to do, and has only been managed once before in Greece, when Arcturos successfully set two cubs free.

Mr Mansbridge said: ‘Zoe must be treated like a wild animal and not have too much human contact. ‘In the wild, she'll wear a satellite collar so Arcturos can monitor her progress and hopefully she'll get on just fine.’ The worker said that Zoe will be released in a forest area where there is minimum human activity. ‘It will be in a great distance from villages, farms and other human facilities.

"By . Lucy Waterlow for MailOnline . A British shopkeeper's daughter who has become a household name in India hasn't forgotten her roots. Geeta Basra, 30, has starred in three major Bollywood films. But when she's not on a set or the red carpet, she's happy to help out at her parents' newsagents in Portsmouth. Her father said his customers have no idea they are being served by a star. He said: 'None of my customers know I have a famous daughter - we keep it very quiet. Scroll down for video . Success: Geeta Basra has starred in three Bollywood films and has more in the pipeline . 'We see all walks of life, being near the dockyards, university and schools, and none of them know we are Geeta's parents.' Geeta was born and raised in Portsmouth and moved to Mumbai at the age of 18 to pursue her dream of becoming an actress. Realised her dream: The 30-year-old grew up in Portsmouth and always wanted to be a Bollywood star . She first fell in love with Bollywood films as a toddler and began dancing and singing when she was just two-years-old. But despite her passion for the musicals, she never dreamed that she would make it onto the big screen and star in her own Bollywood films. She said: 'I've been a huge fan of Indian films forever. I've always wanted to be a part of it but because I'm from Portsmouth I never thought it would be possible. 'It was just a dream. For me to take that decision to stop my education for a while, to put it on hold, was a huge thing. 'I wanted to go to Mumbai and pursue my dreams even though I didn't know anyone here. I'm living a dream. I thank God and my parents - I couldn't be anything in life without my parents' support.' Back home: The actress returns to Portsmouth regularly to see her family and help out in their shop . Living the dream: Geeta gave up her plans to become a criminal psychologist to become a Bollywood star . Geeta gave up her plans to become a criminal psychologist to follow in the footsteps of her Bollywood idol actress Madhuri Dixit. She explained: 'After my studies I decided to go to India and give acting a shot. It's a competitive place and you need to be headstrong to get somewhere - like any other career. 'But I went to an acting school in India and then got an agent. I was very lucky and I really enjoyed it.' She landed her first role in Dil Diya Hai (I Have Given My Heart) in 2006, which grossed 550million Indian Rupees in Box Office earnings (5m British pounds). She has since starred in The Train and her latest film is Mr Joe B. Carvalho. She has also appeared in a music video and will shortly be starting filming for two movies, one in Hindi and a regional one in Punjabi. But she still finds time to help out at her family's Stop and Go corner shop in her home town. Her father, Rakesh, and mother, Parveen, have run the store in Portsmouth for 23 years. Geeta and her siblings, Ruby, 27, and Rahul, 20, all grew up spending their summer holidays serving customers. Geeta said she's proud of her roots and loves spending time at home. She said: 'I was born and bred in Portsmouth, I went to school here and this will always be my home. 'I'm proud to be from Portsmouth and love this city. I love going to the seafront and all the greenery we have. It's all a lot more calm and peaceful compared to hectic Mumbai.'

"By . Emma Innes . A Spanish woman has such severe problems with the blood supply to her fingers that her hands turn purple, and her fingers white, when they are exposed to the cold. The 45-year-old, who has not been named, has severe Raynaud’s phenomenon. The condition occurs when the blood vessels in the hands and fingers go into a temporary spasm blocking the flow of blood. Scroll down for video . A Spanish woman has such severe problems with the blood supply to her fingers that her hands turn purple, and her fingers white, when they are exposed to the cold . The spasms are usually triggered by exposure to the cold and causes the fingers to go numb. When the patient’s hands warm up again, and blood returns to the fingers, they can become very painful. Patients sometimes also experience pins and needles in the affected parts of their body. The condition is not a serious threat to a person’s health but it can be difficult to live with if it means the fingers become stiff and numb every time they get cold. The severe case of the Spanish patient was reported in The New England Journal of Medicine. Dr Marina Anderson, senior lecturer in rheumatology at the University of Liverpool, told MailOnline: ‘This is a very severe case. Raynaud’s is a very common disorder but most patients will not have it so severely.’ Raynaud's phenomenon occurs when the blood vessels in the hands and fingers go into a temporary spasm blocking the flow of blood. Image shows red blood cells in a capillary . She added: ‘A tiny proportion of people with Raynaud’s with have it this severely.’ She explained that it can be problematic when people are trying to take food from a cold fridge or if they are trying to find things in a bag when they are outside on a cold day. She told MailOnline that the Spanish patient was probably developing systemic sclerosis – a relatively rare autoimmune disorder associated with abnormalities in the capillaries. Dr Anderson said: ‘It is very strongly associated with Raynaud’s so if someone presents with new Raynaud’s this needs to be considered. ‘It can affect the gut, the lungs, kidneys and the heart. It’s important to recognise it might be happening so we can prevent damage to internal organs through careful management.’ Systemic sclerosis causes hard, thickened areas of skin and sometimes problems with the internal organs and blood vessels. It is an autoimmune condition in which the body attacks its own tissues, including the connective tissue under the skin and surrounding the organs and blood vessels. It causes hardening of the skin but can also cause problems with the gut, such as heartburn, and joint stiffness, hair loss, weight loss and fatigue. If it also affects the heart, lungs or kidneys it can cause shortness of breath and high blood pressure. Elizabeth Bevins, CEO of the Raynaud’s and Scleroderma Association told MailOnline: ‘Scleroderma is a rare condition, in the UK it's estimated that around 6,000 suffer from scleroderma in one of its forms. ‘There is no cure but improved knowledge over the last few years means it can now be better managed.’ For more information, visit the Raynaud’s and Scleroderma Association website. Raynaud's phenomenon is a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body - usually the fingers and toes. It occurs because the blood vessels go into a temporary spasm blocking the flow of blood. This causes the affected area to go white and then blue and red as the blood returns. It is usually triggered by cold temperatures, anxiety or stress. Sufferers can also experience pain, numbness and pins and needles. It is not a serious threat to health but can be annoying to live with. The only way to manage the condition is to avoid the cold, or to wear gloves. In most cases, Raynaud's is primary - it develops by itself. However, sometimes it is a secondary condition - it develops in association with another health condition. The condition is usually mild and it is thought to affect about 10 million people in the UK. It is three times more common in women than in men.","The 45-year-old woman has severe Raynaud's phenomenon .

"By . Rebecca Brett . A young British adventurer has become the first person to walk 1,500 miles solo across Mongolia... alone. Ash Dykes, 23, strolled into the record books after spending 78 days alone crossing the unforgiving land of the high Altai Mountains, scorching Gobi Desert and the seemingly-endless Mongolian Steppe. He battled raging sandstorms, heat exhaustion and the unrelenting loneliness of crossing the world's most sparsely populated country at walking pace. An incredible accomplishment:  Ash Dykes travelled 1500 miles, over 78 days, in temperatures reaching 40C . Word even spread among the local Mongols about the strange foreigner walking across the country - and the young Welshman was soon nicknamed the 'lonely snow leopard'. But after 78 days of travelling alone and unsupported Ash, from Colwyn Bay, North Wales, became the first known person to walk from Mongolia's western border with Russia to it's easterly border with China. After completing his record-breaking trek on Wednesday, he said: 'It is an absolutely unreal feeling. It still hasn't really sunk in, it feels surreal. Ready, steady, go: Ash started his journey in a small settlement of Olggi in the west of Mongolia, near Russia . 'It is an absolutely unreal feeling': Ash reached Choybalsan in the east of Mongolia at the end of his trek . 'I haven't had the time to fully reflect. I have done what a lot of people said would be impossible.' Ash dragged a 18-stone, home-made trailer behind him all the way from the small settlement of Olggi in the West to the town of Choybalsan in the East. It carried the dehydrated food ration packs, large water butt and camping equipment he needed on his trek through the brutal terrain. Ash covers up during a sandstorm, he says 'The storms, as frightening as they were when you were in the centre of them, were unbelievable to witness' Ash had to fight to keep focused on the goal of reaching his destination to battle the loneliness of walking alone . The one man campsite: 'It was sometimes difficult leaving a really nice family in a small settlement or isolated yurt to face the extreme conditions alone all over again' His longest day of walking saw him on his feet for 14 hours as he covered 34 miles. And he reached a peak altitude of 8850ft along the way. Mongolia is the second-largest landlocked country on earth at 603,930 square miles and the most sparsely populated with only 3,133,318 people - averaging just 5.19 people to every one square mile. And Ash had to fight to keep focused on the goal of reaching his destination to battle the loneliness of walking alone. A trusty steed: The hand-made trailer with Ash's essentials including dehydrated food ration packs, large water butt and camping equipment .

The scuba dive instructor said: 'It was sometimes difficult leaving a really nice family in a small settlement or isolated yurt to face the extreme conditions alone all over again. 'At one point I walked for around eight days without seeing a single soul. But I was so determined to make it that I didn't let it bother me too much.

The long and winding road: Ash is the first person to walk 1500 miles solo across Mongolia - one of the world's most desolate countries . This isn't the first adventure Ash has tackled, having traversed the Himalayas and cycled the length of Vietnam, but he said it was by far his most challenging and rewarding. He said: 'There have been so many unforgettable experiences on this trek it is impossible to list them all. 'The storms, as frightening as they were when you were in the centre of them, were unbelievable to witness. 'Throughout the expedition I felt privileged to see the country first hand and witness its diverse landscape and unpredictable climate' says Ash . 'At one point I walked for around eight days without seeing a single soul.' 'Throughout the expedition I felt privileged to see the country first hand and witness its diverse landscape and unpredictable climate.

"By . Connie Allfrey . Generous Scots are more likely to tip for services than anyone else in Britain – with those living in the North East named the most tight-fisted. Waiters, taxi drivers, hairdressers and others can rely on a bit extra from customers north of the border but may go empty handed in other areas of the country, a survey revealed. Only 13 per cent of Scots say they never tip - the lowest proportion of any region and less than half the stingy 35 per cent of Geordies who refuse to leave a gratuity. Tipping map: Waiters, taxi drivers, hairdressers and others can rely on a bit extra from customers north of the border . The North East is the worst area for workers to get a bit extra from customers, said the survey of 2,000 adults by financial advice service Thinkmoney. It is followed by exactly one in three in the West Midlands (33 per cent) and 32 per cent in the East Midlands who say they never tip. But for Scotland it enhances their reputation for generosity fresh from the positive feedback the country got for the overwhelming success of hosting the Commonwealth Games. 49 per cent of Londoners tip 10 - 20 per cent for services with seven per cent leaving a great 20-40 per cent . North East - 35% . West Mids - 33% . East Mids - 32% . Yorks/Humber - 32% . North West - 29% . East Anglia - 28% . N.Ireland - 27% . South East - 25% . South West - 23% . Wales - 22% . London - 16% . Scotland - 13% . While some areas are reluctant to put their hands in their pocket for low paid workers, just 16 per cent of Londoners refuse to leave a tip. And the capital is the most generous with 49 per cent leaving between 10 and 20 per cent as a tip and seven per cent giving a massive 20 to 40 per cent. This may be as a result of London's expensive cost of living where taxi drivers expect a decent tip and low paid workers need more just to afford to live in the capital. Young people are more generous than older generations with their gratuities, with 88 per cent of 25-34 year olds always leaving a bit extra compared to 70 per cent of the over-55s. Those who work in professions where they receive tips are also most likely to give tips - almost half of taxi drivers, waiters and hair stylists always tip others. Ian Williams of Thinkmoney said: 'A gesture of thanks need not break the bank if tipping is approached sensibly and people only tip what they can genuinely afford. 'But plenty are happy to admit they'd rather not tip at all.'","Survey reveals Scots are the most generous tippers in Britain .

"By . Carol Driver . Prime Minister David Cameron will be jetting off to Portugal for his summer family holiday, a survey reveals. While Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will be snubbing the UK in favour of visiting family in Spain. And Labour leader Ed Miliband will be taking time out in the French countryside. Summer holiday: David and Samantha Cameron, pictured in April, enjoying a break in Lanzarote . The findings come as a study reveals two thirds of MPs are likely to ditch a staycation and fly abroad for a summer holiday. The report, by ABTA - the regulatory body for British travel agents - showed that as many 72 per cent of Conservative MPs are planning on a trip overseas in the coming months. While 63 per cent of Labour MPs are also set to swap the UK for more exotic climes during the break. However, out of the three main parties, the Liberal Democrats are more inclined to take a staycation, with just 47 per cent saying they would travel further afield. Out of the regions, politicians in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Midlands are the most likely to take a foreign holiday, with 77 per cent intending to have a break abroad. Jetting off: In April, the Camerons holidayed in Lanzarote, staying in an upmarket hotel . This contrasts with 74 per cent of London MPs, 64 per cent of MPs from northern England, and 50 per cent of Welsh MPs. MPs in the south of England are the least likely to venture abroad this summer, with only 48 per cent planning a trip. The survey also revealed that male MPs (67 per cent) are more likely to give in to their wanderlust than their female counterparts (60 per cent). ABTA public affairs head Stephen D'Alfonso said: 'Our survey shows that for MPs, like many of their constituents, a holiday abroad is a key part of their summer plans. 'We ask them, as they enjoy their break, to think about the high level of air passenger duty they and their constituents will have paid on flights, and to push for the Government to scrap or reduce the tax for the benefit of the economy as well as local families.' A total of 154 MPs took part in the survey.","Findings reveal more Tory MPs than Labour or Lib Dems to head abroad .

"By . Sarah Gordon . Raw sewage has been washed up on beaches in Cornwall, Hampshire and Kent, prompting fears that holidaymakers could fall ill due to contaminated waters. The warning comes after locals and holidaymakers at Godrevy Beach in Cornwall were evacuated by lifeguards following a sewage warning over the weekend. Surfers were ordered out of the water on Friday after the text alert from a system operated by group Surfers Against Sewage and surf classes over the weekend were cancelled or moved to other beaches as a result of the contamination. Tide of rubbish: A protest was organised against repeat contamination at Godrevy Beach . Local surfer Rory Steadman tweeted: 'It was terrible that Godrevy Beach had to close yesterday due to raw sewage running into it and cutting our surf short.' He later spoke to newspaper The Cornishman, explaining: 'The river that flows into the sea had turned the waves brown, the sea still isn't 100 per cent safe now, 24 hours on!' The latest beach evacuation comes just days after nine beaches were closed in Kent due to raw sewage being released into the sea from storm drains. The sewage discharge affected nine beaches in Thanet, Kent, which relies heavily on summer tourism, including Walpole Bay, Palm Bay, Botany Bay, Kingsgate Bay, Joss Bay, Stone Bay, Viking Bay, Louisa Bay and Dumpton Gap. Hotspot: Godrevy Beach is popular with both local surfers and holidaymakers visiting Cornwall for the summer . A Thanet council spokesman said: ‘We are working with the Environment Agency to reduce the impact of the spillages as much as possible and water sample tests will be carried out in the areas affected today to assess the quality of the water. Southern Water have contractors out clearing the waterline. ‘The council is keen to reassure members of the public that other beaches across the district are fully open and will advise if the area affected extends to any other beaches.’ Local sailors in Hampshire have also complained about 'toilet items' washing up on beaches near popular Hayling Island and Southsea. A spokesperson for Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) told MailOnline Travel that there are 31,000 sewer overflows around the UK, which are supposed to use during periods of 'heavy rain', but are increasingly used during 'rain'. He said: 'We understand that in extreme weather events to protect property and business, they're being used far too frequently, which is disturbing. 'This is the fourth time this summer that sewage has been released at Godrevy Beach and we have had complaints about the beaches in Kent.' The organisation also accused water companies of doing simply 'what is legally required' to rectify the situation instead of tackling it in the way that is needed. Surfers Against Sewage: The organisation claims it is receiving constant complaints from beach communities around the UK as storm drains are increasingly used by water companies . The spokesperson also explained that when beaches look clean, the water can still contain pathogens that cause gastroenteritis, ear nose and throat infections and even E coli and hepatitis. When raw sewage has been released into the water, the World Health Organisation advises against going into the sea for 24 to 48 hours - this is often left up to the discretion of local lifeguards. The situation at Godrevy Beach has seen overflows upwards of 50 times a year even when it has not been considered an excessively wet year. Officials at Eastney Cruising Association in Hampshire say they see sewage affecting the shores of Langstone Harbour and even the beach at Eastney and blamed Southern Water for releasing sewage into the water without informing people. They want the water tested by the Environment Agency to see if it is clean enough. Bob Evans, sailing secretary at the club, said there were sewage items regularly stuck to the sides of the boats when they return to the club. 'You pull up a fishing line and it comes up with a load of toilet paper. In the 21st century in Britain, it's not on.' Tony Dickson, treasurer at the club, said 'My concern is they should be informing the general public. 'My wife swims down there with my nieces. There should be notifications on the beach when the water quality is not as good as it should be and it should be paid for by Southern Water.' Kingsgate Bay was one of the nine beaches in Kent that were closed due to sewage just last week . Officials at Southern Water said there is 'no statutory requirement' for the company to provide flags or signs about the operation of its discharges. This is because Langstone Harbour is not a designated bathing water. However, it does inform the Langstone Harbour Board when there is a discharge. A spokeswoman added 'We are committed to making improvements to our storm tanks and outfall at Fort Cumberland and a £10m scheme is under way to enhance the resilience of this site. 'The first stage of this started last year and changes the way storm water enters and then passes through the tanks on the site. 'Further work to improve the robustness of the site, following the severe damage caused during a storm in 2010, is also under way. This additional work includes refurbishing the pumps and screens on site. 'These screens capture any debris within the storm water before the screened storm water is released. The additional work should be complete by the end of this year.' She added that a £20m upgrade of Portsmouth's sewer system was due to be completed this autumn.","Godrevy Beach for fourth time in Cornwall closed due to raw sewage .

"By . Helen Nicholson . The construction of Stonehenge has been voted the historical event that most Britons would like to travel back in time to witness. The evacuation of Dunkirk, and the defending of Hadrian’s Wall by the Romans came second and third in the poll conducted by English Heritage. The organisation carried out the survey to celebrate the launch of six weeks of living history events across the country this summer, including medieval jousts, knights and princess training academies, and the chance to meet some of England’s most famous kings and queens. Still a mystery: English Heritage's Jeremy Ashbee said people wanted to discover more about who built the historic stone circle - and why . A total of 2,272 people were quizzed about which iconic historical event they would like to have been present at. The lifting into place of the enormous stones at Stonehenge around 5,000 years ago topped the poll with almost half of those surveyed (47 per cent) wishing they’d been there to see it. The masterminding of the evacuation of British soldiers from the Dunkirk beaches during the Second World War was the next choice (34 per cent), while seeing Roman soldiers patrolling Hadrian’s Wall came third (26 per cent). Going underground: In second place, people wanted to watch the planning of the Dunkirk evacuation during the Second World War from the Secret Wartime Tunnels underneath Dover Castle . Watching Victorian scientist Charles Darwin conduct his revolutionary experiments from his home in Kent (23 per cent) and the first Viking raid at Lindisfarne Priory (18 per cent) were also popular choices at fourth and fifth place respectively. King Harold falling in combat at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 (17 per cent) and Henry V preparing his troops ahead of the battle of Agincourt in France (16 per cent) also made it into the top ten. Added to this, 68 per cent of adults said they wished they knew more about history and 47 per cent said they planned to visit a historic place this summer. Stepping back in time: The defending of Hadrian's Wall by the Romans . came second in the poll, while watching Charles Darwin (right) conducting experiments at Down House came in fourth . Jeremy Ashbee, Head Properties Curator at English Heritage, said: ‘There are so many things we don’t know about Stonehenge and perhaps that’s why it topped our poll, with people wanting to discover more about who built the stone circle, and why. ‘It is great that there is such an appetite for history. While English Heritage can’t literally take people back in time, we can offer the next best thing - the chance to experience those places where history was made. 'Over the six week summer holiday English Heritage will host its biggest ever summer of historical events providing fun, entertaining and inspiring days out for families, culture fans and those keen to find out more about England’s stories.’ Devastating attack: In fifth place was the chance to watch the first Viking raid taking place at Lindisfarne Priory .

"By . Chris Kitching . A row over jaw-dropping prices near major attractions in Rome has resurfaced after a group of enraged US tourists complained to the police about being charged £10 for ice cream. Americans James and Marian Luciani and a friend were left with a bad taste in their mouths when they were handed an eye-watering £33 bill for just three ice creams and a bottle of water in Bar Il Caffe, just steps from the famed Trevi Fountain. The shocked travellers paid the full amount and returned the following day with police, but their grievance was put on ice when staff produced a menu confirming the price was £10 per ice cream. Scroll down for video . A cafe near Rome's Trevi Fountain charged a group of American tourists £10 per bowl of ice cream . After falling victim to the profiteering cafe, Luciani told The Local: ‘We'd just paid 59 euros for our entire dinner, including a litre of wine, and then were charged 42 euros for gelato! ‘We've been careful in watching out for pickpockets in Rome, but I never thought I would get scammed here.’ A manager defended the cafe’s prices and blamed the Americans for any misunderstanding. World famous: Ice cream is a popular treat for visitors who flock to The Eternal City . It appears the Lucianis are not the only ones who have chilly feelings about Bar Il Caffe. The corner spot has received more than two dozen negative reviews from angry tourists, who claim they were overcharged for pizza, beer, wine and ice cream. Reviews on TripAdvisor warn fellow travellers not to step foot inside the business. The Lucianis'  lesson is one that many visitors learn in The Eternal City: When in Rome, double-check the price of everything and be mindful of where you order your food or drink at a cafe. Prices are often far less for customers who order while standing at the bar. Many tourists have horror stories about being charged substantially more for ordering while seated at a table. Freeze: Local police officers accompanied the unhappy tourists to the cafe but they had no case . Last year, Rome’s mayor apologised to four tourists from Stourbridge in the West Midlands after they were charged an astonishing £12 each for ice cream cones near the famous Spanish Steps in the city centre. The tourists were backed by a local councillor who called for a clampdown on restaurants or cafes charging extortionate prices to unsuspecting tourists, and a consumer group requested an investigation into the ‘fraud’. A few months later, a group of Italian tourists were charged £85 for four liqueur coffees after they sat down to take in the vistas around the famous St Mark's Square. The bill included a charge of £33 for a five-musician string ensemble who were playing at the cafe.","Couple and friend paid £10 each for a bowl of ice cream near Trevi Fountain .

"By . Carol Driver . Fake camera: Chris Fawcett installed the replica on the A303 to encourage tourists to slow down . Villagers who built a fake speed camera in a desperate bid to slow traffic caused by the new Stonehenge visitors centre have been threatened with legal action. Chris Fawcett has been warned to remove the home-made replica camera from beside a narrow road through the Shrewton, Wiltshire, within seven days or face court proceedings. Mr Fawcett built the speed camera in a last-ditch effort to slow daytrippers attempting to dodge congestion on the main A303 road brought about by the Stonehenge visitors centre, which has seen 500,000 tourists in six months. The £27m centre was opened in December 2013 around 1.5 miles from the site of Stonehenge, a prehistoric monument which forms part of a World Heritage Site. As part of the development the A334, which ran directly past the site, was closed and dug up, forcing all visitor traffic onto the A303, the main commuter route form the M5 to the M3 motorways. Residents of Shrewton, which runs parallel to the A303, reported a dramatic spike in the amount of drivers diverting through the village and ignoring its 30mph speed limit. Mr Fawcett, a father of three, said the fake speed camera - made from an old Ikea cabinet painted yellow - has been a success and he has been heaped with praise by residents. However Wiltshire Council claims the dummy device has been put up illegally on land they own and it has to be taken down because it was not officially installed. Mr Fawcett, 49, a car mechanic, said: 'Since the visitors centre has been open the A303 has become incredibly congested and that in turn has made the road through Shrewton into a rat run for drivers trying to dodge queues. 'We have seen traffic levels through the village rise significantly to the point where people who live here are worried to walk down the road for fear of being hit by a speeding car. Scroll down for video . Warning: Mr Fawcett has been told by the council to remove the camera or face legal action . The speed camera was built to deter tourists from speeding along back roads to Stonehenge visitors centre . 'Not only has the road become heavy with traffic but there's no regard for speed limits. There have been numerous crashes in the last six months and several cats have been killed after being hit by cars. 'One driver was clocked doing 63mph through the village. People fear for their safety. 'The council says it has a robust approach to tackling speeding but they haven't done anything to stop it. 'Everyone who lives here is fed up of it so I decided to take matters into my own hands before someone got seriously hurt. 'I built a dummy speed camera with my eight-year-old son Jake and we put it up on land owned by my next door neighbour. Straight away it had an impact on the speed people drove through the village. The £27m Stonehenge visitors centre has already attracted 500,000 tourists since it opened six months ago . 'I have had villagers coming up to me to thank me for what I've done because it's had such an effect. 'Then I got a visit from someone from the council threatening me with legal action if I don't take the camera down within seven days. They claim it is on their land but I have seen my next door neighbour's deeds which show the land is his. 'If the council want to take me to court over this one I'm willing to fight them. I'm just waiting for them to present something in writing. 'I cannot fathom why, if this simple safety measure is working, they are intent on taking it down yet they aren't doing anything about it themselves.' A spokesman for Wiltshire Council said: 'The council has a robust system for dealing with speeding issues raised by local communities. 'Issues should be referred to the local community area board, who will work with the local community to examine what speed control measures are appropriate for that particular road. 'The considerations to deal with speeding issues will include the use of the volunteer speedwatch scheme, installation of speed indicator devices or other direct measures. 'It is vital that any scheme introduced is effective and delivers the required result. The council would ask everyone to follow the approved procedure to ensure the best scheme is delivered to meet the community needs.'","Chris Fawcett made replica out of Ikea cabinet painted yellow .

"A tiny, timber holiday home with no running water, gas, electricity or toilet has become one of the country's most sought after properties after going up for auction for £75,000. The Chalet - a secluded one-bedroom property which boasts an earth toilet in a neighbouring shed - is set in the idyllic North York Moors National Park. The property offers a back-to-basics lifestyle sitting in its own 1.5-acre field and no nearby houses. For sale: Auctioneer Tom Watson standing outside the holiday chalet in Staintondal, North Yorkshire . Back-to-basics: The Chalet has a small interior but no running water, electricity or gas . Estate agent Tom Watson, who has had hundreds of inquiries, said: 'The phone hasn't stopped ringing because this place is a one-off. The location is superb. 'It's close to the coast and also very private. It's the perfect rural hideaway. There are people who live in the area who don't know it is there.' The isolated property, thought to date back to the 1930s, was bought by a couple in 1948 as a holiday home and is now owned by their grandchildren David and Philip Hopwood. Estate agents have set the guide price range for the property in Staintondale, North Yorkshire, between £75,000 and £130,000. Quaint: The property, which was bought as a holiday home, boasts two single bunk beds . Remote: The tiny property is set in a 1.5-acre field - and no nearby neighbours . David Hopwood said: 'My grandparents bought it 66 years ago for the family and my brother and sister and I spent every holiday there. 'Back then it was next to a working farm. We used to milk the cows and I can remember the horse-drawn plough and helping with haymaking. 'It's an idyllic place. It's a 20-minute walk through the woods to the cove at Hayburn Wyke, a couple of miles to Ravenscar Hall and you can walk or cycle on the old railway line to Scarborough, which is eight miles away.' The family are selling the property with a guide price of £75,000 to £130,000 . The shed has shuttered windows and houses a living area with a sofa bed and a kitchenette with a camping stove. Another bedroom is furnished with bunk beds while the toilet is little more than a hole in the ground in an adjacent shed. Living in The Chalet means homeowners will have to go without electricity and have bottled water brought specially to the site by driving through the neighbouring field. Mr Hopwood said: 'There is no television here. It's just walking, reading and peace and quiet. 'Sometimes on an evening I'll just sit outside in the deckchair and watch the owls and look at the stars. The Chalet - a secluded one-bedroom property -  boasts an earth toilet in a neighbouring shed . 'The skies here have no light pollution so the stars are bright and incredibly beautiful. 'It's one of the reasons I am sad to be selling but we are getting older and it's time to let the chalet go to someone else.' He added: 'It has been very well maintained. My dad was very practical and so is my brother, so they did most of the work, including putting a concrete floor in. 'It's very comfortable and completely dry.' Mr Watson said: 'The idea of getting away from it all in every sense is very appealing.'

"By . Sarah Gordon . It is peak holiday season in Spain, with high hotel prices and expensive villa rentals. But if you are an artist, you can enjoy a two-week stay in one Spanish village for free - as long as you donate a sculpture at the end of it. Dubbed 'Artbnb' - a play on the popular private rental company Airbnb - the unusual concept is being offered by the pretty, whitewashed village of Genalguacil, in Andalucia, Southern Spain. Mountain retreat: The whitewashed village of Genalguacil is offering free stays in return for sculptures . Creative types can descend on the sleepy community and enjoy a stay in local cottages, with all the materials they need to complete their artwork. The only catch is they have to donate one piece of art to the village for display. The unusual concept has led to Genalguacil becoming an open-air museum of art, attracting tourists who come to see the works dotted along the winding streets. Located up in the mountains, just inland from the coastal tourist hubs of Estepona and Marbella, Genalguacil has always been a popular haunt for artists for its bright light. Picture perfect: The pretty village is famous as an artists' retreat and hosts a biannual art festival . So a mayor in the 1990s decided to capitalise on the village's creativity to turn it into a veritable tourist attraction. The biannual 'art encounters' festival lets artists descend on the village to find inspiration for their works, without the worries of having to pay for accommodation. Elias Bendodo, president of the Malaga Council, said: 'Art Encounters sustains a small but important cultural industry in Genalguacil, because thanks to the event, gallery restaurants, artisan shops, artist residences, theatre productions and concerts have sprung up throughout the year.' Work of art: Unusual sculptures can be seen dotted all around the village of Genalguacil . Now this summer, the village has decided to take its idea one step further... by paying 11 well-known artists £790 to stay and create some extra pieces for the town. Among them is Spanish artist Eugenio Merino, whose controversial works include a mannequin of Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco stuffed inside a fridge and a George W Bush punch bag. This year's festival runs from July 31 to August 14 and visitors will be able to see the works of art in the village streets before they are transferred to the contemporary arts museum.","Andalucian village of Genalguacil keen to become an artists' enclave .

"By . Chris Kitching . Holidaymakers are being warned to ease up on the accelerator if they’re driving in Spain this summer, or risk facing tougher penalties for speeding. The popular tourist hotspot has introduced harsh new driving laws, fining motorists up to £325 on the spot for going just 1km per hour over the speed limit. And for motorists caught committing serious speeding offences, the increased fines could now set them back almost £500, warns holiday rental company Europcar. Spain's tough new penalties for speeding could catch holidaymakers by surprise . The top speed on Spain’s motorways and dual carriageways have been raised to 130kmph from 120kmph. But speeds on residential roads have been reduced from 30kmph to just 20kmph, with limits of 50kmph on urban roads. In addition to fines, UK motorists have been warned they risk losing points on their licence for any driving offences committed within continental Europe. Higher fines in Spain or other countries may catch visitors by surprise as European nations get tougher on out-of-country drivers. Open road: The top speed on Spain's motorways is being raised to 130kmph this summer . Brits who will be hiring a car while they are abroad are encouraged to brush up on local driving laws before they leave home. Spain and France are two countries where motorists could face on-the-spot fines. In France, there have been reports of drivers being taken to local cash points if they don’t have enough cash to pay the fine. Police in Spain and other European countries could order offenders to pay a fine on the side of the road . Ken McCall, Managing Director of Europcar UK Group, said: ‘Whichever country you are visiting, don’t get caught out by assuming that foreigners will be exempt from the law. ‘Make sure you do your homework before arriving at your destination so that you remember the trip for all the right reasons.’ Proper planning should also include a travel kit, containing warning triangles, a visibility vest and other essentials, in case of a breakdown. The advice comes as the AA prepares for its busiest month of the year. More than half of all breakdowns recorded by the AA happen during the summer and the average cost of a breakdown in Europe is £612, according to a survey conducted by AA and Populus. France, Ireland, Germany, Spain and Belgium are the most common destinations for a breakdown to occur. The usual problems are engine trouble or the car not starting, followed by flat or damaged tyres, faulty batteries or a collision. Be prepared: A car travel kit, including hazard triangles, is legally required in some countries . Edmund King, AA President, said: ‘August is the peak holiday season for road trips when many families and friends embark on long journeys to Europe in their cars. ‘There are more cars on the road than other times of the year and temperatures are higher than usual, making overheating an issue.’ He added: ‘Many don’t realise that breaking down while driving on European roads can add over £600 to the cost of the holiday. ‘Before heading off, motorists should ensure that they have prepared their vehicles for the journey.’","New laws introduced in May raise the fine for serious offences to £500 .

"By . Carol Driver . A holiday jet passenger has been charged with endangering a flight after he allegedly cracked a window with a single punch. The pilot of Thomson Airways flight Tom145 radioed a message to police at Manchester Airport after the window cracked as the plane travelled at about 35,000ft over Ireland. Officers went to the gate and arrested Nicholas Whittaker, 43, from Ashton-under-Lyne, before he disembarked. The drama happened at about 5.30am as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was coming to the end of its flight from Sanford Airport in Florida on May 25. Scroll down for video . The incident happened on board a Thomson flight from Florida to the UK (file photo) It is understood it was approaching the coast of Ireland when the incident is said to have happened. Nobody was injured. The aircraft was packed with families returning to Manchester from holidays in Florida, with many having enjoyed trips to Disney World in Orlando. Mr Whittaker, of Bentinck Street in Ashton, has been charged with recklessly or negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft or anyone on board, in accordance with Regulation 137 of the Air Navigation Order 2009. He is due to appear before Trafford Magistrates’ Court on August 11. Aviation experts say passengers are only at risk if both the inner and outer pane of an aircraft window are breached. It is understood only the inner pane was cracked. A spokeswoman for Thomson Airways declined to comment on the matter in detail because of the criminal charges, but added: ‘We do have a zero-tolerance approach on all our aircraft. ‘Passenger safety is our paramount priority.’ A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: ‘At about 5.30am on May 25, 2014, police at the airport were informed by a member of the crew that a passenger on an inbound flight from Florida had struck an aircraft window, causing it to crack. ‘On arrival, a 43-year-old man was arrested on the aircraft.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Nicholas Whittaker has been charged over the incident on board flight .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . It is one way to get between two of the planet’s most fabled seaside destinations – but not necessarily one that many travellers would choose. After all, if you are going to make the journey between California and Hawaii, there are plenty of planes which cover the distance while you gaze out of the window. We made it, boys! The adventurers leap into the ocean off Honolulu after completing their monster voyage . And if you want to cross (the western half of) the Pacific the easy way, many a cruise operator will also be happy to give you a leisurely lift. But rowing? That might be quite hard work. Not that this matters to a group of British university friends who have just entered the record books after rowing from America’s west coast to its celebrated Pacific state. Jack Carter, Nick Kempster, Chris Blacketer and Mark Gleeson set off from Monterey, on the central coast of California, on 9 June. They rowed around 1000 miles each, battling against howling winds – which, on occasion, resulted in waves in the shark-infested waters reaching more than 20ft in height. Almost there: The quartet bask in the moment as they make it to Oahu . The four Britons, who all met at the University of Exeter, have now reached their final destination – the Hawaiian capital Honolulu on the island of Oahu. All aged 24, they are the youngest crew to ever row the distance, which is known as 'The Great Pacific Race'. The friends had spent a year preparing for the epic adventure, and almost two months on board the 24ft ocean rowing boat, called Isabel. Using nothing but muscle power, the men rowed in pairs, rowing in two-hour shifts over the course of 50 days – travelling 3,100km (1927 miles). The rovers' arrival: The foursome crossed almost 2000 miles of the Pacific to complete their journey . They have so far raised more than £40,000 for the NOMAN Campaign, which raises awareness of HPV, a carcinogenic virus which causes five per cent of cancer cases worldwide, and infects one third of the UK population. Chris Blacketer, from Ewell, Surrey, says: ‘Each day our hands got a little more blistered and our stomachs decreased in size, which was definitely a good thing looking at some of the pre-departure photos. ‘But the worst aspect by far was the pain in our backsides. Cocktail hour: After such a feat of endurance, the boys have definitely earned a drink . ‘Spending pretty much 24 hours a day either sitting or lying on them, meant we were all on a constant stream of painkillers just to get through the days and be able to sit down, as we were just so blistered and raw.’ They had originally hoped to complete the challenge within 40 days, but were affected by bad weather and unfavourable winds, which pushed them south rather than west. Nick Kempster, from Bath, said: ""This challenge has been immense, and at times it felt like we might not be able to complete it. ‘Everyone's support and messages, as well as our ultimate aim of raising awareness of HPV, have kept us going even when we didn't think we could give anymore. ‘Somehow we always found the strength to keep rowing.’ Scars of battle: Every one of those 2,000 miles is written into the quartet's hands . Mark Gleeson, from Orpington, added: 'fter spending nearly eight weeks in a world less than 24 foot in length, Hawaii seems impossibly large. ‘We're in a lot of pain, and have been for a few weeks now. We are barely able to sit, let alone stand, but everyone is so proud of one another.’","Four university friends row from Monterey across to Honolulu for charity .

"By . Andy Dolan for the Daily Mail . Pensioners are ditching dentures in favour of dental implants, at a cost of up to £30,000. Dentists say more and more retirees are raiding their pensions to pay for the implants, which are not normally funded by the NHS, in search of a dazzling 'Hollywood smile' such as that displayed by A-listers. Simon Cowell and Cameron Diaz are among those celebrities who are rumoured to have had the treatment. More pensioners are visiting private dentists to have implants put in instead of dentures (stock pic) Clinics can charge as much as £3,000 for one implant, £15,000 for a whole row of teeth and £30,000 for a complete set. A dental implant is a titanium screw . that can replace the root of a tooth when it fails. Just like a tooth . root, it is placed into the jawbone and can be used to support one or . more false teeth. The body recognises the titanium as part of itself . and grows onto it, giving a bionic, living connection.  A tooth face is . placed on top of the screw for a perfect smile. The procedure is . tried and tested, and any number of teeth can be replaced, from a single . tooth to a complete set, depending on the condition of the bone in the . jaw. Most implants are fitted by private dentists because they will not be funded by the NHS unless there is a real medical need. Dr Zybutz, who fits up to 2,500 implants a year, told The Times: ‘It means a lot to people. The baby boomers with savings expect a lot more out of their lives — they don’t think their lives are over just because they are 60 or 70. Dentures are described by one dentist as 'walking somewhere when you can take the car' ‘Having dentures is like walking . somewhere when you could take the car. More people in the UK are having . implants now, dentures are yesterday’s solution.' Clinics such as Dr Zybutz’s in London charge £3,000 for one implant, while a whole row of teeth on either jaw will cost £15,000 and a whole set will cost £30,000. Other practices offer the procedure from £995 per implant. Ben Atkins, a trustee of the British Dental Health Foundation, said: ‘The middle classes are getting implants but it doesn’t have to be ‘either or’, you can have one or two implants and attach a denture to it and it’s perfectly secure.’ The trend for implants follows previous fads for veneers, which also create the appearance of pearly white teeth.","Clinics charge £3,000 for an implant, £15,000 for new row and £30,000 for set .

"By . Glen Owen for The Mail on Sunday . Divided: Alan Johnson, then Shadow Chancellor, at a press conference with Ed Miliband in 2011 . Labour MPs are urging former Home Secretary Alan Johnson to run as a ‘stalking horse’ for the party leadership as opposition to Ed Miliband becomes more orchestrated, The Mail on Sunday has been told. The move comes after a week of mounting criticism within Mr Miliband’s top team, including attacks by influential peer Lord Glasman, party policy chief Jon Cruddas, members of the Shadow Cabinet – and even the mother of one of his godchildren. Now a senior Labour MP has claimed that Mr Johnson has been approached to run against Mr Miliband before next year’s General Election. The MP said: ‘The word has gone round that Alan might be prepared to do it – to be a stalking horse.’ The MP added: ‘There is definitely an appetite within the Parliamentary Labour Party for him to do it. Whether he will agree is another matter.’ A stalking horse is a leadership candidate who stands in order to flush out other contenders for the position. But Mr Johnson, 64, would also be a popular choice for leader because of his experience – his five Cabinet portfolios have included Health Secretary under Gordon Brown and Education Secretary under Tony Blair – and his electorally attractive ‘back story’: he was orphaned at the age of 12 and raised in a council house by his sister before working as a postman and building a political career through the unions. Mr Johnson, who backed David Miliband for the leadership in 2010, resigned from Ed Miliband’s Shadow Cabinet citing personal family reasons. Later, it also emerged that his second wife Laura had an affair with his police bodyguard. Mr Johnson is now happy in a new relationship, according to friends. Other sources claim that Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, wife of Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, has been asked to  stand against Mr Miliband but refused point-blank. It has been another torrid week for Mr Miliband, with senior party figures queuing up to  offer criticism. First, Mr Cruddas was secretly recorded on separate occasions talking about how bold ideas were being stifled by the ‘dead hand’ of Mr Miliband’s leadership, and how he was being ‘gamed out’ on a weekly basis. Labour MPs are urging former Home Secretary Alan Johnson (left) to run as a ‘stalking horse’ for the party leadership as opposition to Ed Miliband (right) becomes more orchestrated . Lord Glasman, a one-time policy guru for the Labour leader, warned that the party lacked ‘a sense of direction’ and urged his leader to ‘take a couple of novels rather than think-tank reports as his summer reading’, while Shadow Ministers complained that there had been too many ‘wonkish’ economic announcements that would not connect with real people. Then, to complete his misery, writer Jenni Russell, a family friend who made Mr Miliband godfather to one of her children, warned he would be a ‘disaster at No 10’ because he had surrounded himself with a divided and incompetent team who were unable to cover up his ‘weaknesses’. She said: ‘A leader who can’t inspire confidence, build alliances or enthuse his colleagues will fall apart in No 10.’ Last night, a senior Labour backbencher told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Alan was urged by us to stand against Gordon Brown but flatly refused. 'There is definitely an appetite within the Parliamentary Labour Party for him to do it' - Senior Labour MP . ‘The only hope is that he might now be prepared to consider it. ‘What is clear is that Ed Balls has given up all hope of getting it, and is channelling his ambitions into Yvette. But she has ruled out any move until after the Election. ‘The Shadow Cabinet has divided into two camps: those who think Yvette will go for it, and those who think Andy Burnham will go for it. ‘But they all agree on one thing – Ed Miliband is not up to it. He is out of his depth.’ A spokesman for Mr Johnson said: ‘You can rule out Alan standing. That is not going to happen.’ A Labour Party spokesman declined to comment.","Labour MPs are urging former Home Secretary to run as a 'stalking horse'

"By . John Stevens for the Daily Mail . It is claimed that Anna Yearley, a senior aide to Ed Milliband, referred to Northerners as 'backward' Labour last night threatened to sue one of its own MPs after he claimed a senior aide to Ed Miliband referred to Northerners as ‘backward’. Austin Mitchell, 79, said Anna Yearley made the remark as they rowed about moves to get more young women from the North into Parliament. Last night the party dismissed the claim as ‘completely ridiculous and completely untrue’. And in an . extraordinary move, Labour said it was considering bringing libel . proceedings against Mr Mitchell, who has been an MP for nearly 40 years. Mr . Mitchell, who is standing down from his Great Grimsby seat at the next . election, said the row erupted during meetings about his retirement with . Miss Yearley, 35, Mr Miliband’s political secretary and ‘fixer’. He . alleges she told him that Labour activists in the North were ‘backward’ for not nominating enough female MPs and had blocked moves to promote . more women. He . said she was determined to make them toe the line – and claimed she . talked to him like ‘an educationally subnormal pensioner’. Mr . Mitchell has claimed leading female Labour MPs ran ‘an orchestrated . campaign of abuse’ against him after he attacked the party’s all-women . shortlists, introduced to produce more female MPs. Last . night he said he had not been contacted by Labour about possible legal . action, but had been told by  colleagues that Miss Yearley was ‘very . upset’ about the claims. After . being told that his party was considering libel proceedings, Mr . Mitchell said: ‘Are they? It seems impossible to me. They can’t be.’ However, the MP stood by his claims and said the conversations were witnessed by the party’s chief whip Rosie Winterton. He . said: ‘Of course it happened. Anna Yearley said Yorkshire and the North . had been backward in selecting women, which struck me at the time as . very odd as we’ve got a number of very able women such as Caroline Flint . and Yvette Cooper, who are Yorkshire MPs. ‘I’m not saying she tore my eyes out and went for my genitals or anything like that. I wish she had. No, that was a joke.’ Austin Mitchell said Miss Yearley made the comment to him and also claimed she talked to him like 'an educationally subnormal pensioner' Miss Yearley yesterday wrote on Twitter that the allegations were ‘totally untrue’. She added: ‘I did not say the words attributed to me. I have denied it. I absolutely did not say that.’ Karen Buck, Mr Miliband’s Parliamentary Private Secretary, described the claims as a ‘deeply disturbing attack’. And . Jon Ashworth, deputy party chairman, added: ‘Labour wants to see more . women in Commons. Shame Anna Yearley getting attacked again for that.’ Miss . Yearley is one of the most powerful figures in the party leader’s . office and acts as a link between Mr Miliband, MPs and the unions.

"By . Rebecca Evans for MailOnline . Abducted: Mohammed El Gasim, from Hounslow, west London, was kidnapped by separatist militants in east Ukraine and held hostage for two weeks . A British medical student kidnapped and tortured by pro-Russian rebels in the Ukraine has told of his terrifying ordeal for the first time. Mohammed El Gasim, 21, was abducted by heavily armed militia in the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic and subjected to daily beatings and forced labour. He was accused of being a spy and abused by the same Kalashnikov-wielding, drunk rebels accused of shooting down the MH17 plane, which killed all 298 passengers on board last month. After 15 days of ‘hell’ which he thought would never end, the young student was suddenly released and fled the city without his passport, which had been taken by his captors. With assistance from the British Government, he was helped to safety and arrived back in the UK last week. Visibly shaken Mr El Gasim, whose body is covered in bruises and cuts, said: ‘I just lived to get through each day. I didn’t understand why it was happening or if it would end. ‘I pleaded with the guards to either kill me or release me. I tried not to think about anything apart from surviving.’ Privately educated Mr El Gasim, of Hounslow, West London, arrived in the city of Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, in November to study to be a surgeon. The area was then under the control of the Ukrainian government and was a safe place to be. However, in April this year it fell into the hands of separatists and Mr El Gasim had started to make plans to leave. But due to the bureaucratic mess created in the wake of the uprising, it had taken longer than expected to sort out the paperwork for him to be able to safely leave Donetsk. Three weeks ago, the young student was accosted on his way to a shop for not being able to speak Russian and accused of being a spy. He was attacked and on fighting back, was doused in pepper spray, thrown into the boot of a car and taken to a rebel compound. Once there, he was subjected to beatings by around 50 rebels, who hit him with their fists, feet and guns. He was denied food, forced to carry out physical labour, including digging trenches, and subjected to a barrage of racial abuse by the guards, who Mr El Gasim said used him as a ‘plaything’ for their own sordid amusement. He said: ‘I’d popped out to buy some cigarettes and a drunk Russian man started shouting at me. I understand a bit of the language and he was getting really aggressive because I was speaking in English. ‘Then he hit me, so I hit him back and someone called the self-proclaimed police force who are the rebels. There was about four of them. They started to hit me and started firing bullets around the street. They then sprayed pepper spray in my eyes and threw me in the boot of a car. ‘I just remember lying there in the dark and kicking out at whatever I could, trying to get out. ‘After what seemed like a long time we got to the rebel compound in the grounds of an old university hospital. ‘They all ganged up on me and kept trying to talk to me in Russian. Then the beatings started. ‘They were all kicking me and punching me, I was beaten with their machine guns and pistols. They did this every day, for hours. Most of the rebels were drunk.’ Scarred: Mr El Gasim shows what's left of a wound he suffered at the hands of the rebel fighters who he says also denied him food, subjected him to vile racial abuse and forced him to carry out physical labour . When not being attacked, Mr El Gasim was put in a disused garage, without food or water and with not even a mattress to sleep on. He said: ‘There was no food for the first week but even if there had been, I wouldn’t have been able to eat anything because of all the bruises I had. I was in too much pain. ‘I was their play thing. Sometimes they’d get bored and make you do sit ups or push ups for their amusement. I just went with it, I wanted to get out of there alive.’ Meanwhile back in Britain, his distraught parents had learnt of their eldest son’s disappearance and were doing everything they could to secure his release. Unbeknownst to Mr El Gasim, the rebels had placed his passport on the body of two dead Ukrainian soldiers and accused him of being a spy. His parents, property developer Salah, 53, and medical interpreter Honaida, 42, who have three other children, refused to believe their son was dead and kept up the pressure on the Foreign Office and hit back at the claims made by rebels online and in the Russian media. This international pressure did start to filter through and after a week, Mr El Gasim’s treatment became moderately better. He was still forced to carry out physical labour, but was no longer beaten on a daily basis. ‘After the first week I was told I was being held for hooliganism,’ he added. ‘They told me they’d let me go after 15 days, which in the end they did.’ Safely home: Despite reports of his death, Mohammed's parents, property developer Salah, 53, left, and medical interpreter Honaida, 42, right, who have three other children, kept up pressure on the Foreign Office .

War zone: A resident makes his way through debris as he inspects the damage to an apartment block in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, after Ukrainian forces shelled the rebel-held city last week . His distraught parents did not learn of what their son had fully been through until he arrived home on Monday last week in case their phone calls were intercepted. Mrs El Gasim: ‘We have been in hell, all day and all night we would be on the computer trying to help or praying with family and friends. ‘I just wanted my boy home safe and sound. We didn’t know what was happening as there were so many lies coming out of Donetsk.’ His father added: ‘Every website we saw said our son was dead. It was terrible. We didn’t know what had happened to him. We used to speak to him every day and then he just vanished. We are so relieved he is back with us now.’ The city of Donetsk, a key holding for the rebels, is currently under siege from the Ukrainian army. After his disappearance, a blog written by separatist leader Igor Strelkov claimed Mr El Gasim was a ‘black mercenary’ fighting for the Ukrainian government and that his passport had been found on the body of a dead soldier. Ambition: Mr El Gasim as a child with his brother, Alwaleed, and sisters, Monuira and Dalal. He says he now hopes to continue his medical studies in England and one day become a surgeon . Mr El Gasim, who is a keen rugby player, said that he now hopes to continue with his medical studies in England pursuit of his dream of becoming a surgeon. He said: ‘I’m so happy to be home with my brothers and sisters. It hasn’t really sunk in yet what happened to me and it probably won’t do for a while.’ He said that before the city fell to the rebels, Donetsk had been a good place to live and study. ’I’d been enjoying my time in Donetsk,’ he added. ‘I had a girlfriend and enjoyed going out with friends. ‘When all the trouble started, things began to escalate. There were armed rebels everywhere, check points and curfews but this was the first trouble I’d got into.’ A Ukrainian university official in charge of foreign student welfare said this was this was the first time something like this had happened, adding: ‘This student happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.’","Mohammed El Gasim, 21, was studying medicine in Donetsk, east Ukraine .

"By . Kate Lyons . Last week Matthew Ames made himself a cup of tea for the first time in more than two years. 'I didn’t pour boiling water on myself which was the main objective,' he said. The Brisbane father-of-four had all his limbs amputated in June 2012 after suffering from a severe case of toxic shock syndrome which almost claimed his life. Scroll down for video . Matthew Ames was 39 years old when he went to hospital with what he thought was a bad case of the flu. He had contracted Strep A, which resulted in toxic shock syndrome and led to all four of his limbs being amputated . His wife Diane was told that if Matthew was to stand any chance of survival, they would have to amputate all four of his limbs. She told them to proceed with the operation – the first of its kind at the hospital – and he survived. Now, Matthew, 41, is well on his way to another medical first _ becoming the world's first 'bionic man'. There was not enough left of his limbs for conventional prosthetics to work properly and so he has been fitted with steel implants into his bone, which protrude through his skin, and to which bionic hands will eventually be fitted. The process, called osseointegration, involves two surgeries on each limb. In the first, an implant is placed inside his bone which sits there for six months to allow the bone to grow around it. During the second stage, a bolt is fitted to the implant that protrudes through the skin. He is the first man to have undergone osseointegration of all four limbs and is currently six to 12 months away from having what he calls 'whizz bang bionics' fitted to the bolts, which include bionic hands that he can operate by flexing his biceps and triceps. In the meantime Matthew is building up his strength with short 'training arms', which he describes as 'chopsticks with weights on them,' and short legs he calls 'stubbies'. Matthew and his wife Diane have four children aged four to 10. Their youngest, Emily, was two when his limbs were amputated and does not remember a time when he had full arms and legs . Matthew has undergone multiple surgeries to implant roads into his bone, which protrude from his skin. They will eventually be fitted with bionic hands . Matthew and Diane, both 41, have four children – Luke, 10, Ben, 9, Will, 8, and Emily, 4 – and since being fitted with his new arms and legs he is happy to be able to do more things for and with them. 'There are some things that are a bit easier for me to do – I can turn a page of a book, it's a bit easier for me to help with their homework because I can kind of point to what I'm talking about, I can kind of cuddle them a little bit but they complain that my arms are a bit cold in winter, just some simple things, which is nice,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'A couple of days ago I was instructing one of my sons how to tie a tie, I did it last year with my eldest son and trying to do it without pointing is very difficult, this time I could point to which bit he needed to do.' The prosthetics cost half a million dollars – $150,000 for each arm and $100,000 for each leg – and Matthew requires a new set every six years. 'Because my case if very complex, I need to get the most complex prosthetics,' he said. To fund the surgeries, the couple started a foundation, Renovating Matthew, and were overwhelmed with the response from the community, receiving enough donations to pay their medical costs for the next 10 years. 'We didn't expect anything near the response we've had. We're very lucky,' said Matthew. Matthew, a former energy and resource executive, said that the overwhelming response they had from the community – which included 65 local families joining a food roster to supply them with meals after his first diagnosis – was part of what inspired him and Diane to write a book. 'It was a pretty difficult decision to open up with that level of detail. But I think the experience we had with the community and the consistent feedback we got about how our story had helped others, we wanted to help other people,' he said. 'Out of something disastrous or something tragic, there's been some good that's come out of it and if we can share that with other people, if people take something positive from it, that would be great,' Diane told Daily Mail Australia. Matthew currently wears training arms and legs, which are training his joints to take pressure and weight, he is building up his strength so that he can be fitted with bionics . Matthew is the first person in the world to have all four of his limbs osseointegrated, a procedure that involves implanting a rod inside his bone to which bionics can be attached . The couple, who met at university and have been dating since they were 17 and draw great strength from one another. 'At the end of the day, no matter what happens, the door closes and the kids go to sleep and it's Di and I, so if that solid core wasn't there, it would just be almost impossible to get through,' said Matthew. 'And now I'm home a lot, if she didn't like me that'd be a bit of a problem.' Diane says she takes her lead from Matthew, whom she describes as more 'even-keeled' than herself. 'Before this all happened, I don't think I would've said I wasn't strong enough to go through this, but I would've said Matthew was strong enough. I've been surprised at where I do have the strength,' she said. 'We're a really good team, we've been together for so long... We're very lucky we found each other.' Matthew and Diane have released in the hope that sharing their story will help people and might help form a more inclusive society . Ultimately, Matthew says that surviving such hardship is about the choices people make. 'I could choose to be angry that the diagnosis wasn't picked up, I could choose to be angry with Diane for making the decision, but really thinking about it, what choice is going to be best for me and those people that I love?' he said. 'You can choose to focus on things I can’t do or things I can do. Complaining about stuff is not going to be helpful either – do something about it or shut up.' He would like to see Australians be more inclusive of those around them who struggle. He tells the story of a man he met at the gym who told him he liked seeing him around because it made him feel better about his own life. 'What they mean is: I feel good because your life's bad and my life's better than yours. I'd much prefer it if people looked at that person and said: ""Whatever they've gone through that was difficult, they would have learnt something quite valuable to everybody else."" And if they looked for that and [we]  learnt from each other we would have a much more inclusive society. 'Hopefully by telling our story, people can understand me and our lives and [can] look at someone and think: that person's got some fantastic gifts that people can learn from.'

An unnamed woman has become the latest person to come forward and claim she was physically abused by New Mexican authorities after being forced to undergo invasive surgery to prove she wasn’t carrying drugs. The latest alleged victim claims she was sexually assaulted and that federal agents and medical staff exceeded their authority to search for drugs she didn’t have. The woman was stopped by police in El Paso, Texas, after a drug-sniffing dog indicated that she might have drugs. Medical personnel probed the woman's anus and vagina, said her lawyer Laura Schaur Ives of the New Mexico chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, left . The unnamed woman was given an X-ray, cat scan and full body search at University Medical Center of El Paso . Police then strip-searched her and allegedly assault her by sticking their fingers into her vagina. When the on-site search failed to turn up any drugs, police took the woman to University Medical Center of El Paso. There, she was given an X-ray, cat scan and full body search. Medical personnel probed her anus and vagina, her lawyer Laura Schaur Ives of the New Mexico chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union told KOB4. ‘They then did a cavity search and they probed her vagina and her anus, they described in the medical records as bi-manual - two-handed,’ she said. ‘Again, they found nothing.’ Police reports state deputies stopped Timothy Young, pictured, because he turned without putting his blinker on . Schaur claims that police did not have a warrant to conduct the search, which was the latest such alleged incident to emerge in recent days. The other alleged victims are Timothy Young and David Eckert, who were both pulled over for traffic violations in separate incidents in Oct 2012 and Jan 2013 respectively. They were searched on the authority of the same drug-sniffing dog, called Leo. No drugs were found in the possession of either man. Both Young and Eckert were then taken to Gila Regional Medical Center in Silver City, New Mexico, where doctors performed a full battery of invasive medical procedures including cavity searches, x-ray scans and digital anal probes. While these incidents involved New Mexico police, the woman who Schaur represents was allegedly handled by Customs and Border Control. All three victims protested their treatment at the hands of police and medical staff and refused to be examined. Not only were their protestations ignored, but in Eckert’s case, doctors he was given the bill for his own forced colonoscopy.

Collins, who confirmed that James Forrest and Adam Matthews will miss the match through injury, was speaking at Glasgow airport before the Scottish champions flew out to Maribor and said: 'It is probably 50-50.

Celtic's tie against Maribor was finally confirmed on Monday night after the Court of Arbitration for Sport turned down Legia Warsaw's last-ditch request to be re-admitted to the Champions League. The Polish club had beaten the Hoops 6-1 on aggregate in the third qualifier but were punlished by UEFA for bringing on a player who should have been suspended in the second leg at Murrayfield.

'We are looking forward to it. They are the Slovenian champions, we have had them watched a few times but again, it is all about our performance. 'We want to keep it tighter at the back, make sure we don't concede soft goals and when the chances come along put them in the back of the net. 'They are probably a similar standard (to Legia) but we are two or three weeks further forward in our preparation and match practice.

"By . Jack Gaughan . Follow @@Jack_Gaughan . Mauro Zarate is a very different striker to Carlos Tevez but wants to make a similar impact to that of his fellow countryman at West Ham. The 27-year-old marked his debut with a superbly struck volley in the comfortable win at Crystal Palace on Saturday, with obvious comparisons immediately struck. Tevez’s seven crucial goals at the back end of the 2006-07 season - most notably a winner away at Manchester United - kept the Hammers in the Premier League. Delighted: Zarate impressed on his debut for the Hammers as he scored a superb volley against Crystal Palace . Fans favourite: Despite his short stay at the club Tevez was and remains highly regarded by West Ham fans . Zarate is the sort of player, dropping off the front man, who should see that Sam Allardyce doesn’t have any such worries this year. He was majestic when pulling the strings from deep at Selhurst Park and offered reasons to believe he is the man to bring excitement back to Upton Park - as requested by the club’s board in the summer. ‘Tevez is a star. He won everything. The Champions League with Manchester United, everything with Manchester City,’ Zarate said. ‘I am very different. I know he was very popular with West Ham fans. I hope I can have the same impact. ‘He scored some very important goals for West Ham but I am another person, another player so I want to go step by step.’ Zarate speaks regularly with Sergio Aguero - the pair go out to dinner together - and revealed that the City striker believed West Ham was the right club for him. Role model: Zarate is hoping to enjoy similar success to what his fellow countryman Tevez had at West Ham . Briefly a Birmingham City player in 2008, noteworthy for a sumptuous free-kick against Everton, Zarate has endured a turbulent couple of years - the low point of which was when Lazio refused to pick him following a series of very public disputes. After a year back home in Argentina, Zarate now appears to be back - although has never scored enough goals throughout his career. New coach Teddy Sheringham has been working alongside him in the week and was visibly delighted when Zarate flashed home the opener at Palace. That was because the pair had rehearsed the exact scenario time and again in training. ‘He [Sheringham] has really helped me. We have been practicing volleys like that in training. From the the edge of the box - the same. He was very happy and he celebrated the goal too.’ Sheringham wasn’t the only one who looked pleased. Allardyce’s face was a picture as the goals went in as he seems to have hit upon a formula which may yield both results and pleasure in equal measure. Asked about Zarate, Allardyce said: ‘He likes to come off and start up the top and play coming off and find spaces that none of our players are like that. ‘He’s a different kind of player to what we’ve had before. It’s very important in terms of wanting to play against a certain team and what strengths he would give you by playing against that certain team. ‘He has some strengths which other players at the club don’t have and I thought he showed that.’","The Argentine hopes to have a similar impact to what Tevez had when he played for West Ham .

"By . Dominic King for The Mail on Sunday . If Jack Wilshere wanted to go quietly about his business, a tweet just before kick-off catapulted him firmly into the spotlight. As the England midfielder prepared for a game that was always going to provide a stern examination of Arsenal’s credentials, Piers Morgan proclaimed to his 4.2million followers that he ‘bet @JackWilshere has a big game today. Convinced he’s going to have a huge season. #quality’ No pressure, then. Coming just 48 hours after Arsene Wenger complained that Wilshere had been put ‘under too much pressure’, Morgan’s declaration guaranteed every step the 22-year-old took would be scrutinised. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jack Wilshere's Ice Bucket Challenge . Don't believe the hype! Jack Wilshere struggled to impose himself during Arsenal's draw at Everton . This, after all, is the type of game in which he should be making a difference. The thing with Wilshere, though, is that we are still waiting for him to put it all together and run a game that matters, to dominate the type of contest in which Arsenal have habitually fallen short down the years. After another troubling evening on Merseyside, the wait goes on. If Arsenal were collectively abject for 83 minutes, failing to deal with Everton’s slick passing and movement, Wilshere epitomised their shortcomings, not getting a look-in as James McCarthy and Gareth Barry dominated. He set the tone for a petulant display as early as the fifth minute, complaining without justification to referee Kevin Friend after being outmuscled by the energetic Steven Naismith. Sulking and scowling, Wilshere shuffled around on the periphery and never looked to take charge. There have, of course, been well-documented fitness problems down the years but this effort — coming after a similarly anonymous showing against Crystal Palace in which he was substituted after an hour — never threatened to get out of first gear. Why me? The England midfielder argues with referee Kevin Friend at Goodison Park on Saturday evening . Crunch! Sylvain Distin attempts to take the ball off Wilshere before Arsenal's stirring comeback . When Everton broke forward, Wilshere never had the pace to snap back and help Mathieu Flamini, while his occasionally forays into the opposition area lacked the wit or invention to cause problems. As his frustration mounted, it came as little surprise when he was booked for scything down Barry. ‘I believe at the moment he should not respond (to criticism), just focus on his game,’ Wenger argued. ‘At the moment I believe he should just focus on being fit, present and improve physically. If Wilshere can maintain his physical fitness, he can have a huge career.’ Yet that is a big ‘if’. Wilshere has long been championed as the player who will provide the fantasy in Arsenal and England’s midfield but, at present, his form merely adds weight to the acerbic comments Paul Scholes made about him last spring. When Wenger has a full complement of midfielders, where does Wilshere fit in? It should be pointed out that Wilshere — roundly booed by Everton supporters when Wenger did the decent thing and ended his evening on 73 minutes — was not the only Arsenal player to let his manager down badly. How much did you pay? Arsenal's new striker Alexis Sanchez looked hopelessly out of sorts on his own . Mesut Ozil started his first competitive game since winning the World Cup with Germany but his meaningful contributions could be counted on the fingers of one hand. Indeed, his loose ball enabled Everton to break and score their second goal before half-time. Alexis Sanchez, meanwhile, looked hopelessly out of sorts deployed as the lone front man. The experiment lasted 45 minutes, during which the Chilean never had a shot and Everton’s swagger nearly took the game away from Arsenal. All, clearly, is still not right with the Gunners. At least the changes Wenger made in the second half worked magnificently and the fighting spirit they showed to rescue the contest might be a trigger for them to have a big season. Whether the same can be said for their lacklustre No 10 remains to be seen.","Arsene Wenger's side came away from Goodison Park with a point .

He took to Twitter, asking followers to help bring her back, a call which was quickly taken up by  Perrette -- who plays Abby Sciuto on the television series NCIS. Perrette met Renowitzky at a children's charity event a year ago. Shortly afterwards she bought a new wheelchair for him after his was run over, and the pair have been friends ever since.

Love, a toy poodle, was brought back by by Raymond Dixon who said he bought her for $375 in a Walmart car park to replace his aunt's dog who got run over . Perrette offered a $5,000 reward for whoever brought Love back. She previously bought Renowitzky a new wheelchair after it got run over last year . After she offered a $5,000 reward, Oakland-resident Daymond Dixon came forward saying he had unwittingly bought the dog for $375 in a Walmart parking lot on Wednesday night. Speaking to NBC Los Angeles, Dixon said: 'I feel relieved knowing he got his dog back.' He added that he bought the pet for his aunt after hers was run over in an accident. Renowitzky was paralyzed from the chest down aged 20 after he was shot in the chest while leaving a club in 2007, with the bullet shattering his spinal chord. He founded the Life Goes On foundation, which helps young people avoid violence and overcome obstacles, and now works giving speeches and attending charity events to raise awareness.","Arthur Renowitzky had dog Love stolen while climbing into his wheelchair .

A number of supporters stormed onto the field immediately after the Vikings were beaten 28-6 by Castleford in a televised clash at Leigh Sports Village and approached rival supporters in a provocative manner. Castleford fans appeared not to respond to any goading but violence did break out as police and stewards attempted to restore order.

'We’ve had an overwhelming response and the information we have received will be invaluable in conducting a thorough investigation. 'I wish to thank the supporters for supplying this information and would encourage anybody with any details to continue to supply that to the club, which will then be submitted and utilised within the investigation process.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone is again ready to run Formula One on a full-time basis after ridding himself of what he described as 'three and a half years of aggravation'. After spending three months on trial in a Munich district court on charges of bribery and incitement to breach of trust, on Tuesday Ecclestone paid a £60million settlement to end the case. Bavarian state law allows defendants to make such a payment, with no presumption of innocence or guilt, to a non-profit making organisation, or the treasury. VIDEO Scroll down to watch F1 boss Ecclestone pays to end bribery trial . Back to business: Bernie Ecclestone is keen to get back to Formula One on a full-time basis after paying a £60m settlement to end a bribery case in Germany . Aggravation: Ecclestone, seen here giving an interview to a German TV station after leaving Munich District Court, described the case as 'three and a half years of aggravation' VIDEO F1 boss Ecclestone pays to end bribery trial . In this instance, £58.6m will go directly to the German state, with the remainder to a German charity that looks after terminally-ill children. It was not the scenario Ecclestone envisaged as he was determined to prove his innocence, but with the trial exacting a toll, the 83-year-old and his defence team decided to make the offer. 'The bottom line is it's been three and a half years of aggravation, travelling, meeting lawyers, and God knows what else, so it is good it is out of the way,' said Ecclestone, speaking to Press Association Sport. 'This trial has been going on for two days a week and it was going to go on until October. 'When you're trying to run businesses it's not easy trying to resolve things when you're dealing with lawyers.' Settlement: Ecclestone paid £60m to end the case, with £68.6m going directly to the German state and the remainder to a German charity that looks after terminally ill children . In 2006, German regional bank BayernLB sold their 47.2 per cent stake in F1 to private equity firm, and the current majority shareholders, CVC Capital Partners. Prosecutors claim Ecclestone paid Gerhard Gribkowsky, formerly the chief risk officer of BayernLB, a bribe of £26m to steer the sale to CVC. Ecclestone claimed he was being 'shaken down' by Gribkowsky who was threatening to inform HM Revenue & Customs he controlled an offshore family trust known as Bambino Holdings. Although Ecclestone has continually insisted the trust is not in his name, if an investigation had uncovered to the contrary he would have been liable for a tax bill of around £2billion. Gallingly for Ecclestone, if the trial had run its course through to October, in all likelihood he would have been acquitted. Consultation: Ecclestone talks to his lawyer Sven Thomas after arriving in court on Tuesday . In summation, after deliberating for three hours on the offer made by the defence and agreed by the prosecution, presiding judge Peter Noll declared: 'The charges could not be substantiated.' Ecclestone added: 'In the end what has happened today is good and bad - the good is the judge more or less said I was acquitted, and they (the prosecution) really didn't have a case. 'So I was a bit of an idiot to do what I did to settle because it wasn't with the judge, it was with the prosecutors. 'Anyway, it's done and finished, so it's all right. I'm content, it's all fine. This now allows me to do what I do best, which is running F1.' In January, to alleviate his workload with the trial then looming, he agreed to stand down from a number of directorial positions on companies related to F1, including the main board. Now, Ecclestone said 'I stood down for obvious reasons, but I'll be back on again now. Everything is back to normal.'","Bernie Ecclestone says he is ready to return to Formula One on full-time basis after £60m settlement to end bribery case in Germany .

The horse's shoulder where it was injected with gasoline. The blood spot initially looked like an insect bite but went on to swell and left the horse unable to stand. Jolean was put down last Wednesday . Mr Hoogerhyde told MailOnline today that he had rescued Jolean 18 months ago from a cruel farm where she was beaten and starved. He said: 'It was a complete transformation, we had her loving people again.' Mr Hoogerhyde kept Jolean and two other horses on his land on Southeast 55th Avenue Road  alongside a neighbor, who also has three horses. He said: 'I noticed a blood spot on her shoulder last Monday but it looked like a bug bite. I gave her medication but she began to swell and bloat.
