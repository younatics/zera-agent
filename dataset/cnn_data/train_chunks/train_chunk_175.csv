"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. and other intelligence agencies recently broke up a plot to bomb an airliner and have seized an explosive device that is similar to ones previously used by al Qaeda, officials said Monday. The plot was discovered before it threatened any Americans, and no airliners were at risk, one U.S. counterterrorism official said. A nonmetallic explosive device like the one used in the failed attempt to bomb a Detroit-bound jet in 2009 was recovered, the official said, adding that it was meant for use by a suicide bomber. A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said authorities have ""no specific, credible information regarding an active terrorist plot against the U.S. at this time,"" although they continue to monitor efforts to carry out such attacks. President Barack Obama was told about the plot in April, and the attempt ""underscores the necessity of remaining vigilant against terrorism here and abroad,"" the White House said. The threat was foiled around the same time as the anniversary of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, although a second U.S. counterterrorism official said the attempted attack was not timed to coincide with the death of the al Qaeda leader. ""What this incident makes clear is that this country has to continue to remain vigilant against those that would seek to attack this country. And we will do everything necessary to keep America safe,"" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta soon after news of the plot broke. The FBI said it is conducting technical and forensic analysis on the improvised explosive device that was seized abroad. The device is similar to others previously used by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which Western officials describe as al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate, the FBI said. The device was meant to be put on a U.S.-bound airline, U.S. Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The New York Republican said discovery of the bomb plot is just one part of an ongoing operation. ""It's not over as far as the operation itself, which is why you're seeing very few details being given out,"" he said. Both King and a senior administration official said the intended user of the bomb is no longer a threat. The recovered device, which never made it near an airport or airplane, was not built to be a so-called body bomb, the official said. ""AQAP is the responsible group here,"" said a different senior U.S. official. ""While similar, a preliminary review of this device shows that it has some significant differences from the device used in the Christmas Day attack. It is clear that AQAP is revamping its bomb techniques to try to avoid the causes of the failure of the 2009 device,"" the official said, referring to the Detroit incident. U.S. officials believe AQAP has more than 1,000 members in Yemen and connections to al Qaeda leadership in Pakistan. The Yemen affiliate has been behind two of the most audacious attempts to target the United States in recent years: the attempted 2009 bombing and the printer bombs loaded onto cargo planes in 2010 and destined for an address in Chicago. In both cases, U.S. authorities believe the bombs were built by Ibrahim al-Asiri. Both devices contained a main charge of PETN, a white powdery explosive that conventional ""single beam"" X-ray machines are rarely able to detect. In 2009, al-Asiri fitted out his own brother, Abdullah al-Asiri, with a PETN-based underwear bomb to kill Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, a top Saudi security official. The device killed his brother instantly but failed to kill its target. Senior al Qaeda operative killed by airstrike in Yemen . The government of Yemen has been fighting AQAP for years, with mixed results. On Sunday, a senior AQAP operative wanted for his role in the USS Cole bombing was killed by an airstrike in Yemen, officials said. Fahd al Quso, 37, was killed while riding in a vehicle in the Rafdh district in Shabwa province. He was hit by a CIA drone strike, U.S. officials told CNN. The weekend attack plus the foiled airline plot delivered a ""one-two punch"" against AQAP, said the senior administration official. ""This was a key victory for us. It also reminds us, though, that this war is not going to end in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda has metastasized and morphed. And they are constantly attempting to find new ways to get at us,"" said King. CNN's National Security Contributor Fran Townsend, Elise Labott and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","NEW: Device was meant to be put on a U.S.-bound airline, says U.S. Rep. Peter King .

"Tiberias, Israel (CNN) -- Two Americans reunited with their families Tuesday in northern Israel, a day after kidnappers freed them unharmed after three days of captivity in Egypt. ""We put our faith on God, and he don't let us down,"" Michel Louis, one of the Americans, said from the city of Tiberias. Kidnappers in Egypt released Louis, Lisa Alphonse and their tour guide Monday after holding them hostage since Friday. Louis recalled the moment the kidnappers came aboard their tour bus. He offered himself as a hostage when gunmen took Alphonse, he said. Louis is the pastor of a Pentecostal church in Boston and Alphonse is a parishioner at another American church. ""She's a member of my group. So I said I (can't) leave her to go alone, because I don't know what can happen to her, and I decide to go with her,"" he said. Louis, a diabetic, was given pita bread, eggs, tea and water by his kidnappers, he said, and was moved each night to sleep in a different location. Alphonse was the only female in the group. She said she feared for her life, but had faith that God would not let her die. ""Where we were, we didn't know if we (were) coming back,"" she said. Kidnappers seized the three Friday in Egypt's Sinai region after gunmen boarded the bus, which was on its way to Israel, family members said. Michel Louis' wife was on the bus when the kidnapping occurred. The family was not aware of security concerns in the Sinai region, where Americans had been kidnapped and swiftly released in two incidents since February, said Louis' son, Jean Louis. ""If we were aware, I would believe we would use correct judgment not to enter that area,"" he said. Kidnappings and armed robberies have increased since a popular uprising ousted Egypt's long-ruling dictator, Hosni Mubarak, last year. In the latest incident, one of the alleged kidnappers, Germy Abu Masouh, is a member of a prominent Bedouin tribe in the Sinai. He had demanded Egyptian police free his uncle imprisoned in Alexandria on drug charges. Authorities did not give in to the kidnappers' demands, Egyptian officials said.

"(CNN) -- BlackBerry's loss of market share in the U.S. is the stuff of legends. Last fall, it was estimated only about 2% of American phone users were still carrying their BlackBerry mobile with its iconic keypad. But consider this: sub-Saharan Africa is expected to add 175 million new mobile users in just the coming 3 years. That's according to the GSMA, which represents the world's mobile operators. ""Mobile has already revolutionized African society and yet demand still continues to grow by almost 50 percent a year,"" said Tom Phillips, Chief Government and Regulatory Affairs Officer, GSMA. That could be good news indeed for BlackBerry. Research in Motion, the maker of BlackBerry, estimates it holds a 70% market share in countries like South Africa. The company's new phones, announced this week, are not the ones some of its best customers in emerging markets would like to buy. They're too expensive. But Research in Motion -- which also this week changed its company name to BlackBerry -- is pledging some of its six new models will address that. While millions in China, Europe and the U.S. have adopted Android or iOS smartphones with a vengeance, millions more users in emerging markets are enthused about what's in store for the new BlackBerry 10. It's the update for what many of them are already using. They live in countries like Brazil, Malaysia, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. They have embraced the BlackBerry for a combination of factors that all point to the different way mobile devices are used. Unlike their counterparts in Europe and America, the mobile in their pocket is more likely to be their primary link to the internet. BlackBerry Messenger is the connection that allows these users unlimited conversations without paying charges for SMS data. While young, brand-conscious Chinese may be willing to part with several months' salary to buy the latest iPhone, African users are looking for more practical (and cheaper) connections. What separates developed countries from their developing counterparts at street level can be summed up in a single word: infrastructure. Isobel Coleman, senior fellow and Director of the Civil Society, Markets and Democracy Initiative at the Council on Foreign Relations, says mobile technology has proved it can bridge the gap where infrastructure is lacking. ""It's a culture, it's an economy, it's innovation, education, healthcare, it's all of these things,"" says Coleman. You can take that to the bank. For many Africans, their cell phone account is the first bank account they've ever owned. In emerging markets, mobile phone banking is growing because of the lack of infrastructure. Fewer bank branches often mean long distances to travel and long lines once you've arrived. Africans are expected to transfer more than $200 billion per year or 18% of the continent's GDP by 2015. Oh, and that keyboard. No matter where you are in the world, there will always be a demand for a keyboard that clicks. The company appears to understand that as BlackBerry 10 models come with both soft keypads and the traditional BlackBerry buttons. I asked some of my Twitter followers to weigh in on the BlackBerry 10 roll out. While some said Android or Apple's iOS were in their future plans, many others expressed continued enthusiasm for the BlackBerry. Soji, a pianist and teacher in Nigeria tweeted back ""I'm falling in love with this BB. Cheaper to own."" From Kuala Lumpur, Amir wrote ""I need a physical keyboard to type while also having a touch-screen for photos etc. Security factor also important."" Hans-Eric from South Africa reinforced the sentiments of many mobile users in emerging markets: ""The cost of data is simply too high without it (BlackBerry.)"" The voices from emerging markets couldn't have been clearer. What they expect from BlackBerry 10 is a stronger, longer lasting battery, durability and continued low cost connectivity. CFR's Coleman agrees that BlackBerry (and anyone else) trying to win and hold this mobile device sector has to understand how these devices are being used and give the customers what they want. ""Cheap. Rugged. Not too many bells and whistles. Practical."" There is little doubt smartphones are changing the way people use the internet, how they bank, shop and interact socially. But it's worth keeping in perspective that in a world where there are now an estimated 1 billion smartphones, there are 5 billion feature phone users. That's a lot of upside growth potential for BlackBerry and all the other players out there.","BlackBerry sales have slumped in the U.S. but is still strong in emerging markets .

"(CNN) -- As he was falling asleep, the father of five turned to his wife and said he hopes it will all be worth it someday. Maybe someday, Mohammed Al-Qahtani said, his daughter be able to walk somewhere without a male guardian. Maybe someday, she'll be able to drive a car without fear of arrest. ""Maybe I'm dreaming,"" Al-Qahtani said. ""My newborn daughter, maybe one day she will vote for the prime minister in Saudi Arabia. ""Of course, there will be a price to be paid, and we are more than willing to pay that price."" The 46-year-old economics professor, who is also one of Saudi Arabia's most prominent human rights activists, has been on trial for several months in Riyadh. He faces nine charges, including breaking allegiance to the Saudi king, describing Saudi Arabia as a police state and turning people and international bodies against the kingdom. His co-defendant, Abdullah Al-Hamid, faces similar charges, including spreading chaos, questioning the authority of official clerics and undermining public order. If convicted, both could go to prison for several years. Al-Qahtani calls the accusations against them nonsense and says he knows why he and Al-Hamid were really put on trial. He said he and Al-Hamid have stoked the ire of the kingdom for running an activist group that is trying to expose human rights violations in the country. ""We have a number of cases where people are thrown in prison arbitrarily, torture, forced disappearances. ... Whatever rights abuses (you could think of), you could find in Saudi Arabia,"" Al-Qahtani said. According to rights groups, Saudi authorities have been increasingly targeting activists through the courts and other arbitrary means such as travel bans. ""This has been a systematic approach by the authorities in Saudi Arabia -- namely, the targeting and harassing of activists across the country,"" said Tamara Al-Rifai, spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. Al-Rifai told CNN that accusations against activists generally include ""instigating chaos, gathering illegally, harming the reputation, talking to foreigners, talking to the media, etc."" She said there is no clear criminal law in Saudi Arabia and that people ""are being arbitrarily arrested and detained for exercising rights that are stipulated by all international human rights laws, but also the Arab Charter of Human Rights to which Saudi Arabia has adhered."" In June, Amnesty International issued a statement calling Al-Qahtani's trial ""just one of a troubling string of court cases aimed at silencing the kingdom's human rights activists."" ""The case against him should be thrown out of court as it appears to be based solely on his legitimate work to defend human rights in Saudi Arabia and his sharp criticism of the authorities,"" said Philip Luther, director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Program. When asked about the case and about accusations that Saudi Arabia is cracking down on dissent, Saudi officials have been reluctant to comment. ""At the Interior Ministry, our area of responsibility is security,"" said Maj. Gen. Mansour Al-Turki, spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry. ""My understanding is that these cases are being looked at by the courts now. Nobody will comment on cases being looked at by the courts."" In Saudi Arabia, a deeply conservative kingdom and an absolute monarchy, protests are prohibited. Still, activists say, small gatherings are becoming more frequent -- demonstrations by both men and women demanding the release of jailed relatives. The latest high-profile incident happened early this month. According to rights groups, Saudi security forces arrested a group of women in the town of Buraida who were protesting over family members allegedly held for years as political prisoners. The women said the relatives had been detained without charges on suspicion of terrorism. The scene of Saudi police circling the women was caught on video, sparking anger and more protests. And in November, activists say, Saudi security forces in Riyadh detained dozens of protesters, including women and children, who were urging the government to release political prisoners. ""I don't want my kids to face this Dark Age kind of prosecution,"" Al-Qahtani told CNN. ""So we are trying to push the limit so our kids will live in a world where their fundamental rights will be respected."" In 2009, he, Al-Hamid and a few others founded the Saudi Political and Civil Rights Association, or ACPRA. ACPRA, according to Al-Qahtani, actively reports on human rights violations and attempts to help relatives of political prisoners free their loved ones through lawsuits against the government. A group like that needs a license to operate. But despite repeated attempts, Al-Qahtani says, the Saudi government did not give them one. Al-Qahtani, who was educated in the United States, believed that if he pushed harder, he might get somewhere. He, Al-Hamid and other members began regularly posting updates about their campaign on ACPRA's website and e-mailing information to a growing base of members and supporters. In December 2010, ACPRA called for all Saudis to participate in a public sit-in to demand political reform. The sit-in was eventually canceled, as the ministry of interior told the organizers their request was refused. Last January, ACPRA crossed one of the country's ultimate red lines by being openly critical of Saudi Arabia's interior ministry and demanding the interior minister be prosecuted for human rights violations. They've also circulated petitions for the release of Saudis they believe are political prisoners. While Al-Qahtani and Al-Hamid have tried to file complaints in court, those efforts went nowhere because the court system did not process them, Al-Qahtani said. The activists also wrote to United Nations special rapporteurs, independent experts who investigate human rights abuses worldwide. Al-Qahtani said the United Nations responded to their letters and that U.N. human rights investigators issued opinions on a few of the cases. He said that's another reason why he's in hot water with the authorities. ""We were trying to highlight the violations, document these violations, try to write officials in Saudi Arabia, try to remedy the situation, try to improve, push the limit for freedom of expression,"" Al-Qahtani told CNN via Skype. While Al-Qahtani and Al-Hamid are still free, al-Qahtani says they've been banned from travel, and the Saudi authorities keep a close eye on them, repeatedly calling them in for questioning. ""We have weekly sessions of interrogation,"" he said. ""They [would] ask these details that's just about our ... activism."" But as their own freedoms have been fettered, they've begun finally reaching an audience they envisioned from the start. The activists' profile brightened in recent months with coverage of their upcoming trial. Stories began appearing in both Eastern and Western press. Foreign Policy, a highly respected global news magazine, named Al-Qahtani as one of its 100 top global thinkers of 2012. ""He has broken some of Saudi Arabia's biggest taboos, highlighting corruption within the monarchy and questioning its legitimacy to govern,"" the magazine wrote. Along with his organization's website and YouTube channel, Al-Qahtani regularly tweets updates about his case and his interrogation sessions. ""We have seen young kids being attracted to the campaign that we are running,"" he said. ""Many people want to join our organization. So these are encouraging signs."" Throughout their trial, other Saudi activists, academics and intellectuals have crowded the courtroom on several occasions. They've also taken to social media to express their support. ""So there are some positive signs,"" Al-Qahtani said. ""It's not all bleak."" But if the fate of other ACPRA members provides any clue of how things might go, the outlook isn't bright for him and Al-Hamid. In April, group member Mohammed Al-Bajadi was sentenced to four years behind bars. Amnesty International said he was found ""guilty of participating in the establishment of a human rights organization, harming the image of the state through the media, calling on the families of political detainees to protest and hold sit-ins, contesting the independence of the judiciary and having banned books in his possession."" And in December, political activist Suleiman al-Rashudi was arrested, according to his wife, after giving a lecture in which he said protests were permitted in Islam. His wife, Um Ammar, told CNN she has not been allowed to see her husband or speak to him since he was detained and is extremely worried about him. Al-Rashudi, who was recently elected president of ACPRA, previously spent five years in detention and, according to activists, was found guilty last year of, among other things, financing terrorism, incitement against the king and attempting to seize power. ""There's no guarantee that [ACRPA's work] will get people the rights for freedom of expression,"" Al-Qahtani said. But he said even if he and Al-Hamid go to prison, they've started something special. Their cause won't end if they're locked up, he said. The belief that freedom can be had in Saudi Arabia has now been shared with others who want it. They've embraced it, he said, and will shoulder the effort. ""At least,"" the professor said, ""we have done our share.""","Human rights activists in Saudi Arabia say they're being targeted by the government .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Former porn star Jenna Jameson was charged with battery over the weekend after police said she assaulted someone. The incident took place in Orange County on Saturday evening, police said. Authorities released bare-bones information about the incident Sunday night, saying little more than the person who was assaulted made a citizen's arrest and called officers. Jameson, 38, knows the person, but Newport Beach Police Lt. Evan Sailor said he didn't know what their relationship was. Police took Jameson to the Newport Beach Police Jail. She was later released without having to post bail. The battery charge is a misdemeanor. No one from the Jameson camp was available for comment. On Sunday afternoon, however, Jameson took to Twitter to offer a post that said she was robbed by a friend who ""broke into my home and took everything."" Jameson added that the friend ""accused me of gusting her."" At the height of her success, Jameson was an industry unto herself. She appeared in countless adult films, magazines, and strip clubs -- and as CEO of ClubJenna Inc., launched a film production and online licensing company. In a 2004 interview with CNN following the publication of her book, ""How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale,"" Jameson said she chose the right profession. ""I mean, I've always been so overtly sexual. And I've always been driven to succeed at something that hasn't always been accepted by the American public,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""So I think I chose the right profession."" She retired from porn in 2008. In recent years, the mother of twins has found herself in the headlines for her brushes with the law. Last May, she crashed her Range Rover into a light pole in Orange County. Police charged her with driving under the influence. In April 2010, the father of her twin boys, mixed martial artist Tito Ortiz, was charged with domestic violence when Jameson's father called police as Ortiz and Jameson argued. Ortiz and his lawyer told reporters later that he was upset because he thought Jameson had relapsed in her rehabilitation from a prescription drug addiction. Four days after the incident, Jameson was captured by cameras alternately saying Ortiz was ""the sweetest, most amazing man"" and saying that he had beaten her.","The victim makes a citizen's arrest and calls officers .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Police in Santa Monica, California, were searching Saturday for an ""extremely dangerous"" 61-year-old man in connection with a bombing at a synagogue. Authorities began their investigation Thursday after the blast at Chabad House. Investigators initially called the explosion an accident, but on Friday, they determined foul play was involved in the explosion, police said. Police spokesman Sgt. Jay Trisler told CNN on Saturday that authorities were still searching for Ron Hirsch, 61, in connection with Thursday's bombing. Investigators began searching for Hirsch after finding evidence at the damaged synagogue, the Santa Monica police said in a statement. ""Investigation has determined that items found in and around the mechanism are linked to an individual by the name of Ron Hirsch, identified as a transient,"" a police statement said. ""Hirsch is known to frequent synagogues and Jewish community centers seeking charity from patrons. Hirsch is considered extremely dangerous."" The explosion shattered windows at the synagogue and sent a 30-pound pipe into the roof of an adjacent house but no one was injured, CNN affiliate KABC reported. Authorities do not know the motive for the bombing. Hirsch also faces charges of possession of a destructive device, police said. Authorities reversed their initial determination Thursday that the explosion was the result of an industrial accident involving cement and other materials, Santa Monica police said. Further investigation by bomb technicians unearthed a large portion of the cement found at the scene and uncovered materials indicating the device appeared to have been deliberately constructed, police said. Santa Monica is a coastal city adjacent to Los Angeles. CNN's Rosalina Nieves contributed to this report .","Suspect is a transient who is extremely dangerous, police say .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Kenneth Cole is the first to admit he has a bit of a language problem. Pun-loving Kenneth Cole pays tribute to inspiring people in his new book. ""I need to distort not just leather and fabric, but also words,"" he said. ""It's a disorder I have."" The pun-loving fashion designer has raised plenty of eyebrows with advertising copy that ranges from the provocative and the political to the lighthearted and cutesy. Browse his online store and you can buy a T-shirt that reads ""In war is it who's right, or who's left?"" A canvas tote bag says, ""Use me again and again and again ... (I'm used to it)."" Should you purchase either product, you're assured that all your money will go to Cole's ""Awearness Fund,"" an initiative designed to draw attention to social issues like homelessness and AIDS. To that end, Cole has just released a new book called ""Awearness: Inspiring Stories About How to Make a Difference"" (DK Adult). It's a collection of essays from influential types intended to encourage readers to get involved in service and volunteerism in their communities.  Watch Cole talk about 'Awearness' » . Former President Bill Clinton contributes a piece on the global fight against HIV/AIDS. Actress Rosario Dawson writes about empowering young Latinos to vote, and cyclist Lance Armstrong discusses the merits of starting a movement like Livestrong, his effort to energize the fight against cancer. As Cole says: ""No good deed should go unpublished."" Pun intended. The book commemorates 25 years in the fashion business for the New Yorker, as well as a quarter century as an advocate for social activism. Cole spoke to CNN about the book, the belief, his wife and the cover. (OK, so not everyone is brilliantly punny.) The following is an edited transcript of the interview. CNN: What is the big message you're hoping to get across with this book? Kenneth Cole: The message is that these are extraordinary times. They're transformative in so many ways. And America recently expressed the reality that there is an appetite for meaningful, significant, social change like we've never seen before. CNN: In the introduction of your book, you talk about how you've met a lot of people who have inspired you. Is there one person who stands out above the rest? Cole: There are so many people that inspire me, and there are 90 role models in this book, some of whom I've been very close to. I am the closest of all to my wife, who is in and of herself a change agent and has committed to impacting the realities of homelessness -- and making sure I get out of the house every day to do what I have to do. So she's inspired me and she's done great stuff. So I think I'll stay with that answer. CNN: In Robert Redford's essay on freedom of speech, he encourages the use of humor when speaking out about a cause someone feels passionate about. Has humor helped you? Cole: I think it does. I agree with Mr. Redford, and he's been a model of mine. ... And I think we also have these walls around us, and when people disagree, we're inclined not to listen, but to a degree you can break through that wall often with humor. Jon Stewart has shown us how to do that, as have some other people who are in the art of doing it well. CNN: What's your biggest hope for President-elect Barack Obama's presidency? Cole: He has already surpassed my greatest hopes. I think he's created a sense of spirit and energy and opportunity in this country that we've never seen. And I think it has transformed, in a sense, who we are as a nation globally within 24 hours. We saw that happen. CNN: How does a successful fashion designer, who also has a big conscience, feel in a weak economy? Cole: I think it's an extraordinary opportunity. There are only so many things we can do that make us feel better. We pick up the newspapers and we want to cry every day. We turn on the news and we want to jump out the first window, jump in front of the first truck. And there's not a lot you can look forward to right now ... but you can make yourself look better, and if you look better, you'll feel better, and it becomes self-fulfilling. I think fashion can do that to you. You can do it with some older stuff and mix it with newer stuff, or you can just do new cool stuff by a new cool American designer (smiles). And starting from the ankles down, and then up. CNN: Do you think that fashion gets a hard rap? [Are] people too quick to write it off as frivolous and underestimate its power? Cole: I've struggled with that over the years. Is fashion relevant? Is it frivolous? Is it trivial? Because I give so much of my essence to it, as do everybody I work with. I've come to two conclusions. One is that it's as relevant as anything, because most of the people you encounter in a given day don't get to know anything more about you than how you appear. You're making a very thoughtful statement ... so I think fashion is important. And then at the end of the day if someone you know is sick or someone you know can't afford the roof over their head or the food on the plate, then it becomes not so important. So I think it's relevant, and for me it's been an extraordinary resource for me to do so much. And I love fashion. I think it makes us feel good. And if you feel good, we do good.","Kenneth Cole highlights public-spirited people in ""Awearness""

"(CNN) -- In what's believed to be the first case of its kind, the same-sex spouse of a member of the military will be buried in a national cemetery. ""I am deeply grateful to my country for honoring and respecting my years of service and my relationship with Nancy, the love of my life,"" said retired Lt. Col. Linda Campbell, a veteran. ""Willamette National Cemetery is a beautiful, peaceful place. Knowing that Nancy and I can join my parents on that hallowed ground is a source of great comfort and healing,"" she said. Nancy Lynchild, Campbell's partner, died in December of metastatic cancer. Military extends some benefits to same-sex partners . The cemetery is located southeast of Portland, Oregon. The Department of Veterans Affairs released a statement, saying Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki used his discretionary authority in the case. ""This was the first non-Veteran partner of the same gender he was asked to consider, this is the first he has approved. It's important to note that the Secretary did not base his decision on the individual's marital status or state recognized relationship status, but rather based it, in part, on evidence of a committed relationship between the individual and the Veteran,"" it read. His decision applies just to Campbell and Lynchild; it does not represent an official change in policy. Though gay people can now serve openly, the military doesn't formally recognize same-sex marriage under the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The divisive act, which was passed in 1996, bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages and says other states cannot be forced to recognize them. During her 25-year military career, Campbell served in the National Guard and Reserve. She was an Air Force recruiter, a military aide to the Oregon governor and served on the Governor's Military Advisory Council. During the Vietnam War, her duties included Air Force casualty notification for Colorado. Lynchild worked as a home repair specialist and as director of housing with the Housing and Community Services Agency of Lane County, Oregon, according to a statement from Campbell, Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian. The senator applauded the secretary's decision. ""I can only hope that this historic moment is just the first of many for same-sex couples across the nation.

"Washington (CNN) -- A Canadian company has reapplied for a permit to build the Keystone XL pipeline that would connect the tar sands oil development in northern Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast, the State Department announced Friday. TransCanada Corp. wants a permit for a section of the pipeline that would run from the Canadian border to connect to an existing pipeline in Steele City, Nebraska, according to a State Department statement. The issue has become a political football in the United States, with Republicans accusing the Obama administration of delaying the project in an election year to placate the environmental lobby. Top Republicans, including presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney, say the issue shows that Obama's energy policies are harming economic growth. The administration says Republicans are trying to force approval of the pipeline project before necessary review has been completed. Earlier this year, the State Department, which has authority over permits for international pipelines, rejected TransCanada's first application because it lacked an alternate route to avoid a vital aquifer in Nebraska. Last month, TransCanada proposed an alternate route through Nebraska, and state officials say it will take six to nine months to fully review it. In its statement Friday, the State Department said it was ""committed to conducting a rigorous, transparent and thorough review."" ""We will begin by hiring an independent third-party contractor to assist the department, including reviewing the existing Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) from the prior Keystone XL pipeline review process, as well as identifying and assisting with new analysis,"" the State Department's statement said. It said that previous estimates for a final decision on the 1,700-mile pipeline -- intended to carry between 500,000 and 700,000 barrels of crude oil a day -- targeted the first quarter of 2013. Last year, the Obama administration postponed a decision on the pipeline until 2013, citing concerns raised by Nebraska officials and environmental groups about the original route near the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides drinking water for much of Nebraska and is important for the state's agricultural economy. Republicans accused Obama of putting off the issue until after the November election, then forced the addition of a provision to speed up approval of the project in the December debt ceiling agreement despite warnings by Obama that the 60-day timeline for a decision would guarantee rejection. The State Department turned down the application in February, and TransCanada then proposed a new route through Nebraska. Supporters, including the oil industry, say the pipeline would create jobs and reduce the country's dependence on oil imported from volatile regions. Republican leaders have continued pressuring Obama and Democrats to speed approval of the pipeline, saying the project has already undergone several years of review. The American Petroleum Institute, which advocates for the oil industry, called Friday for the government to approve the new permit application without further review. ""The earth hasn't moved, the geology hasn't changed, the information remains the same, so there should be no reason for a re-review,"" said API Executive Vice President Marty Durbin. ""The pipeline will be state of the art and has already been thoroughly examined for more than three years, including three environmental assessments."" Opponents, including environmentalists, say that the pipeline might leak and that it would lock the United States into a particularly dirty form of crude oil that might ultimately end up being exported anyway. Anthony Swift of the Natural Resources Defense Council called Friday for a thorough review of the new application that examines the proposed pipeline as well as the merits of tar sands oil development. ""The world of oil and our understanding of the dangers of tar sands have changed since the first time TransCanada applied for a permit for Keystone XL back in 2008,"" Swift wrote on the group's website. ""The process for evaluating this permit request needs to be thorough, rigorous, transparent and free from conflicts of interest."" Obama announced in March that he would approve the southern portion of the pipeline, which runs from Cushing, Oklahoma -- a key repository of U.S. oil -- to the Gulf. He had said he was always in favor of permitting that portion, even when the administration blocked the full project. Currently, there are not enough pipelines to take the oil being produced in Canada and North Dakota to refineries and terminals on the Gulf. That means Midwest refineries can pay lower prices to get it. Giving the Canadian oil easier access to the Gulf means the glut in the Midwest goes away, making it more expensive for the region, but it would increase the amount of that oil available to global markets. Mike Linder, director of the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality, told CNN last month that it will take at least six months for the state to fully review the alternate route proposed by TransCanada. Linder, a Republican who is a political appointee, said the first step would be public hearings. TransCanada will then consider that feedback to determine the specifics of the proposed alternate route, he said. Once TransCanada submits that final proposal to his department, it should take 30 to 60 days for the review to be completed and a draft supplemental impact statement prepared, Linder said.

"(CNN) -- Paris Saint-Germain's Zlatan Ibrahimovic has insisted he is not a ""bad boy"" on the eve of his latest return to Barcelona, where he lasted just a season after falling out with then coach Pep Guardiola. The Swedish striker, whose goal and assist in the first leg mean that PSG head into Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal level on aggregate (2-2), suffered a disappointing spell with the four-time European champions between 2009-2010. Following a couple of years in Italy with AC Milan, the 31-year-old has now settled in France, where he tops the Ligue 1 scoring charts -- his 26 goals from 28 games nine better than his nearest rival. ""I think people have this image of me,"" Ibrahimovic told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""It's enough that someone in a newspaper says I have a bad character and then everybody jumps on this train. If people judge me like that, it's fine by me, because this is part of the game. ""But when you get to know me, you will have a different opinion. Like when I came here, everybody said 'bad boy' because everybody thinks I am that -- I am not."" The former Ajax, Juventus and Inter Milan player's career has been dogged by controversy and outspoken comments, even if his time at PSG has been largely devoid of incident so far. However a quick look at some of the flashpoints that have peppered Ibrahimovic's career -- breaking a rib during a fight with Milan teammate Oguchi Onyewu, threatening to break the legs of Rafael van der Vaart, another so-called colleague, and being sent home from a crunch Sweden qualifier for ignoring a curfew -- suggests that with the talent, comes some baggage. ""Never judge a person if you don't know him,"" said Ibrahimovic, who was raised in Malmo after his father (Bosnian) and mother (Croat) emigrated to Sweden in the 1970s. ""I'm not difficult to work with, trust me. When you have my confidence, I will do 200% for you. When you don't have my confidence..."" The trailing off tells its own story and it's easy to fill in the blanks, especially given the way Ibrahimovic's time at Barcelona -- which cost the Spanish giants $60 million in addition to the exchange of Samuel Eto'o, who Barca valued at $26 million -- ended following his disagreements with Guardiola. Ferrari or Fiat? The Catalan coach may have won 14 trophies during his 2008-2012 tenure, including two Champions League crowns, but he earned the wrath of the strong-minded Ibrahimovic when changing his tactics to accommodate the desires of a certain Lionel Messi. This all came after 'Ibra' had set a Barca record in becoming the first player to score in all of his first five league games for the club, a feat that had proved beyond previous club legends such as Romario, Hristo Stoichkov and Eto'o himself. ""It was a childhood dream [to join Barcelona] and I was walking on air,"" the Swede wrote in his 2011 biography 'I am Zlatan'. ""It started well but then Messi started to talk. He wanted to play in the middle, not on the wing, so the system changed from 4-3-3 to 4-5-1. I was sacrificed and no longer had the freedom on the pitch I need to succeed."" Over the course of the season, the relationship between the most expensive signing in Barca's history and the club coach disintegrated, with Ibrahimovic feeling underused and an 'annoying distraction [and] outsider' for Guardiola. Matters came to a head on 1 May 2010, three days after Barcelona's Champions League semifinal exit against Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan, with Ibrahimovic letting his frustrations spill out after being consigned to a five-minute substitute role during a 4-1 win at Villareal, . ""Guardiola was staring at me and I lost it,"" continues the Swede in 'I am Zlatan'. ""I thought 'there is my enemy, scratching his bald head!'. I yelled to him: 'You have no balls!' and probably worse things than that. I added: 'You are s****ing yourself because of [Mourinho]. You can go to hell!' Having once told Guardiola that he had 'bought a Ferrari but [drove] it like a Fiat', Ibrahimovic now claims that his problems with the Spaniard, who will lead Bayern Munich next season, had more to do with his persona than his coaching abilities. ""We have to be clear -- I spoke about Pep as a human not as a coach,"" the PSG star told CNN. ""For me, as a coach he is fantastic, as a human, we can discuss."" Despite his desperation to leave Barcelona, with Ibrahimovic playing his last game for a club (where he netted 21 goals in 41 games) one year into a five-year deal, the Swede says he looks back on his time with the club favorably. ""About Camp Nou, it's fantastic. I had one year there, a great experience, a fantastic year,"" he added. ""I learned a lot -- outside the pitch, inside the pitch -- and for me it is an amazing club and I have only positive things to say. When I come back, hopefully it will be a good game and hopefully I will enjoy it."" He has returned to the club once before, losing 3-1 last April as AC Milan were dumped out of the Champions League quarterfinals -- albeit with the former Barca man creating the Italians' solitary goal. Despite winning a remarkable eight league titles in a row with five different clubs between 2004 and 2011 (the two with Juventus were later taken away because of the Calciopoli corruption scandal), Ibrahimovic has famously never won the Champions League. And ahead of his date with destiny with Messi, Xavi and Iniesta -- all of whom he described as obedient 'schoolboys' in the Barca dressing room -- the outspoken Swede insists it will not be a lasting regret should he never lift the famous trophy. ""[I want to the Champions League] a lot but that doesn't mean anything -- because my career has been fantastic anyway.""","PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic says he does not deserve his ""bad boy"" reputation .

"(CNN) -- Can companies patent human genes? It was the question considered by an Australian federal court judge who on Friday ruled that a U.S. biotech company was within its rights to hold Australian patent 686004. That patent covers mutations of the human gene BRCA1 which point to a greater hereditary risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The same gene, along with another, BRCA2, is at the center of a high-profile lawsuit in the U.S. set to be heard by the Supreme Court in April. That lawsuit argues that patents on human genes violate the First Amendment and U.S. patent law because genes are ""products of nature"" and therefore can't be patented, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The Australian Federal Court defeat was a crushing blow for cancer campaigners who have been fighting to have the patent declared invalid since the case was first filed in June 2010. ""I won't give up the fight because this is too important for future generations of people who at some point in their lives may need testing and treatment for cancers and other diseases,"" said breast cancer survivor Yvonne D'Arcy, one of the parties in the case. Rebecca Gilsenan of Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, who represented D'Arcy and Cancer Voices Australia, said: ""We are disappointed in this ruling but it is not necessarily the end of the issue in a legal or policy sense. ""We think there may be grounds to appeal, and that there's a reasonable chance that we will make that decision in the next week or two."" Reasons for the Australian ruling . In his ruling, Justice John Nicholas found that the process of isolating the BRCA1 gene for testing requires human intervention, and because of that human intervention the isolated gene is patentable. He said there was ""no doubt that naturally occurring DNA and RNA as they exist inside the cells of the human body cannot be the subject of a valid patent."" However, he said that the issue in this case was whether an isolated nucleic acid constituted ""an artificial state of affairs."" He ruled that it did. The lawsuit, the first of its kind in Australia, was filed against two biotech companies, U.S.-based Myriad Genetics, which owns the patent, and Genetic Technologies in Melbourne, which has exclusive rights to the testing in Australia and New Zealand. Gilsenan said that currently Genetic Technologies was not enforcing its ownership rights under patent laws, though it did attempt to in 2008 but backed down after public backlash. ""At the moment is it's not being strictly enforced, but nevertheless researchers and testing institutions feel conscious of the fact that it could be enforced at any time and their work or their testing could be stopped or they could be in trouble for doing it."" Genetic Technologies declined CNN's request for comment on the ruling, and at the time of writing Myriad Genetics was unavailable for comment. Supreme court to hear case in U.S. Myriad Genetics is also defending its right to own a patent on the gene in the U.S., where it is named in a lawsuit alongside the University of Utah Research Foundation and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and the Public Patent Foundation, argues that the patents on genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are unconstitutional and invalid. According to the ACLU, the lawsuit was filed on behalf of ""researchers, genetic counselors, women patients, cancer survivors, breast cancer and women's health groups and scientific associations representing 150,000 geneticists, pathologists, and laboratory professionals."" It was filed in 2009 and has since bounced from the New York federal court to the appeals court and the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments in the coming months on whether human genes can and should be patented. The genes at issue . According to Myriad Genetics' website, approximately 7% of breast cancer cases and up to 15% of ovarian cancer cases are caused by mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The company says people found with mutations of either gene have ""risks of up to 87% for breast cancer and up to 44% for ovarian cancer by age 70."" It says its BRACAnalysis test can confirm the presence of mutations so carriers can form ""patient-specific medical management plans to significantly reduce the risk of cancer."" ""This is the beginning of personalized medicine,"" said Sally Crossing, spokesman for Cancer Voices Australia, a national network representing Australians affected by cancer. ""Any testing or access to material for researchers needs to be made as free and as easy as possible for them just to speed it up."" Crossing said the Australian ruling was ""extremely disappointing"" but not surprising. ""There seems to be a mindset in Australia to protect patents at all costs,"" she said. ""To our way of thinking it's an anomaly of the Patents Act that was never intended to be applied to the human body."" She said Cancer Voices Australia would be pushing for an amendment to Australian law to cover human genes. ""I think the only thing for us to do now is to look at having an exclusion clause in our current patent law or put up a whole new law. That's what we will be advocating for and supporting,"" she said.","Australian federal court rules patent on human gene testing valid .

"(CNN) -- The nation's aviation security chief is sticking to his decision to permit small knives on planes, despite increasing pressure to reverse course. There was immediate opposition from some pilots and flight attendants to the decision last week by Transportation Security Administration Administrator John Pistole. Those flight crew members are concerned the decision dangerously relaxes aviation security and sends the wrong message to a flying public eager for more simplicity and efficiency in passenger and bag screening. But the situation in Washington grew more intense on Monday. By afternoon, more than 20,000 people had signed a petition to whitehouse.gov calling on the TSA to keep knives off planes. Moreover, key lawmakers have sought a reversal of the decision, and the biggest airlines are now wondering if the mater was thought through carefully enough. ""Additional discussion is warranted before items that have been banned for more than 11 years are allowed back on aircraft,"" said the industry's chief trade group, Airlines for America. One industry leader, Delta Air Lines chief executive Richard Anderson, said previously the decision will add little to aviation security efficiency while raising risks for passengers and crew members. But Pistole is resolute that the move is correct, that U.S. aviation security has improved since the 2001 al Qaeda hijack attacks on the United States to the point that the likelihood of a similar plot succeeding against a commercial airliner is remote. ""Our intent is to implement the changes on April 25,"" TSA spokesman David Castelveter told CNN on Monday. Pistole is expected to defend the decision on Thursday at a House Homeland Security Committee hearing. Flight attendants: Decision doesn't make sense . Castelveter said the new rule is consistent with Pistole's embrace of Risk-Based Security. This emphasizes detection of liquid explosives and improvised bombs that experts say pose a far greater risk to airline security. Experts believe hardened cockpit doors and engaged passengers minimize chances that hijackers using small knives would be successful. Bombs, however, can be hard to detect and can get aboard planes in a number of ways, including cargo. The agency, created in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, banned small blades and other sharp objects in response. Over the past decade, it has added and subtracted items from its prohibited list, permitting small screwdrivers, small scissors, cigarette lighters and matches, and banning large quantities of liquids and gels. The TSA said the latest decision will bring the United States into basic compliance with international standards. These allow knives shorter than 6 centimeters, or 2.3 inches, aboard aircraft. Castelveter said Pistole twice considered internal proposals to alter the list without making changes. But in his third review, which included vetting by TSA leadership and security experts, Pistole opted to act. TSA screeners find 4-5 guns on a typical day . In response to concerns from Federal Air Marshal Service leadership, Pistole continued excluding small knives that most closely resemble weapons, specifically those with blades that lock in place or have molded hand grips. He also decided to keep box cutters and razor blades on the prohibited items list because there is ""too much emotion associated"" with their use in the 9/11 hijackings. Still, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, and Rep. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, both called upon Pistole over the weekend to reconsider his decision. And on Monday, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi said the decision appeared to have been made ""in a vacuum"" and will impact millions of passengers. Thompson is the senior Democrat on the panel that will hear Pistole's testimony later this week. Others opposing the change include the Flight Attendants Union Coalition, representing nearly 90,000 flight attendants, and the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations (CAPA), which represents 22,000 airline pilots. The journey of airport security booty . ""We believe the threat is still real and the removal of any layer of security will put crew members and the flying public unnecessarily in harm's way,"" CAPA President Mike Karn said. In addition to the small knives, the TSA will allow passengers to carry two golf clubs, toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks and pool cues -- aboard in carry-on luggage. Pistole said in a three-month period last year, the TSA seized 47 small knives from passengers at Los Angeles International Airport alone. But the knives presented little threat to the plane, he said. ""Our greatest concern, the greatest risk, is non-metalic IEDs, whether that's explosive, whether that's (an) electronic initiator or a chemical initiator, whatever that may be. That's what I want security officers to focus on,"" he said.","TSA rolled back prohibition on small knives aboard commercial flights .

"Steubenville, Ohio (CNN) -- A computer forensics expert testified Thursday about text messages to and from one of two Steubenville, Ohio, football players accused of raping a drunken teenage girl. The testimony from Joann Gibb of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation came on the second day of a case that focuses heavily on texts, cell phone images and social media posts surrounding the alleged sexual abuse of the 16-year-old girl in August 2012. Two Steubenville high school football players -- Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16 -- are accused of sexually assaulting the girl during a series of end-of-summer parties in August. The teens are charged with rape. Mays also charged with illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material. Defense attorneys say the two are innocent. According to prosecutors, Richmond and Mays each penetrated the victim's vagina with their fingers, an act that constitutes rape under Ohio law. Prosecutors contend the text messages between Mays and his friends and classmates on August 12 detail a night of heavy drinking and the sexual abuse of the girl. The defense questioned the validity of the messages, with Mays' attorney asking Gibb whether she could be absolutely sure the messages were from his client. ""I can't put a person behind a cell phone,"" she said. Steubenville teens treated girl 'like a toy,' prosecutor says . Texting teens . Some of the messages were between Mays and the alleged victim. In one message she asks what happened ""last night."" ""And don't lie about anything. I need to know the truth. People keep asking. Idk (I don't know) what to say,"" the message said, according to Gibb. Mays responded that ""nothing happened last night,"" telling her in the message she performed a sex act on him, Gibb testified. CNN is not identifying the girl in line with its policy of not identifying the alleged victims of sexual assault. CNN is also not identifying minors who testify at the trial but is identifying Mays and Richmond, whose names have been used by court officials and their attorneys and in multiple media accounts. Some of the messages from Mays, according to Gibb, say he had sex with the girl while in others he say the girl performed a sex act on him. One message asked Mays: "" Did u do it?"" He responded, according to Gibb: ""No, lol. She could barely move."" Another message to Mays from still another friend asked ""how dead is she?"" Mays responded, according to Gibb, ""not at all, she's looking for her phone."" Still another graphic message from Mays to a friend appeared to detail his anger over being accused of rape. ""I'm pissed all I got was a hand job, though. I should have raped since everyone thinks I did,"" the message said, according to Gibb. The testimony Thursday showed just how much of the case rests on the prosecution's stance that the alleged victim was too drunk to consent to sex. Teen rape trial shines unwelcome spotlight on Ohio town . 'Stumbling and slurring' One of the witnesses, a college freshman who described himself as a friend of Mays and Richmond's cousin, testified he saw the alleged victim ""stumbling and slurring her words"" at the first of a series of parties that night. The next day, he testified he texted Mays from a friend's phone asking about the alleged rape and told him he could go to jail for that. Mays responded, according to the witness, that the girl knew what she was doing. The witness said he responded: ""No, she don't."" Asked why he said that, the witness said ""because I saw how drunk she was at the party."" On cross-examination, the witness admitted to Richmond's attorney, Walter Madison, that he was angry by what he heard happened to the alleged victim because he considered her a friend. A police captain also testified Thursday about finding two photos of a nude girl on a cell phone belonging to Mays. Rape allegations engulf town . Consent vs. non-consent . The case will hinge not on consent but rather on whether Mays and Richmond knew that the girl was too impaired to know what was happening the night of the alleged attacks, prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter said in opening statements Wednesday. Six witnesses for the prosecution testified Wednesday, saying the alleged victim appeared to be drunk: stumbling, swaying and throwing up. One witness, a 17-year-old girl who went to a party with the alleged victim, said she and the girl shared a half a bottle of vodka, which they each poured into a flavored crushed ice drink. The alleged victim also had a beer and seemed to get drunk very quickly, the witness said. The party broke up about 12:30 a.m., and the girl left with Mays and Richmond, according to the witness, who said she pleaded with her not go. The witness said she didn't see the girl again until the next day, when she picked her up at another home. She described the girl as a ""mess,"" wearing her stained shirt inside-out. On cross-examination, Richmond's attorney, Madison, asked the witness whether her view of what had happened that night had been framed by the tweets and social media posts she had seen about the victim and whether what she had seen in those messages made her angry. She said it had. Another witness, a 17-year-old friend of Richmond's, said on cross-examination that while the girl appeared drunk, he did not believe she was unaware of what she was doing. The boy also told Mays' attorney, Brian Duncan, that he hadn't seen the girl drinking and had not witnessed Mays involved in any sexual contact with the girl. The trial, which is likely to stretch into the weekend, is moving quickly to accommodate the schedule of visiting Judge Thomas Lipps, who is presiding over the trial without a jury. A verdict is expected by Sunday. The case has cast an unwelcome spotlight on Steubenville, a small, down-on-its-luck town along the banks of the Ohio River. Critics have accused community leaders of trying to paper over rampant misconduct by players of the highly regarded Steubenville High School football team and have suggested that other students took part in the assaults or failed to do enough stop them. The case has attracted the attention of bloggers and even the loosely organized hacking group Anonymous, which have questioned everything from the behavior of the football team to the integrity of the investigation.

"(CNN) -- Racing at the Daytona International Speedway can be like playing the lottery against 42 other drivers who all have a ticket, all seem to have an equal shot at winning. While luck can certainly help, so does experience, something Jimmie Johnson put to use as the laps wound down in NASCAR's season-opening and most prestigious race of the season. Johnson won the Daytona 500 on Sunday, edging out Dale Earnhardt Jr., who finished second for the third time in four years. Johnson, who won the race for the second time, led 17 laps on the track where speeds are limited by a restrictor plate. The result is close racing, with cars separated by hundredths of a second. It's a race that often involves a big wreck near the end, so Sunday drivers were content to line up one by- ne and go around and a round and around for the first 180 laps. Then Johnson took over. ""I had a lot of confidence leading the train,"" Johnson said of being the first car in line as drivers raced around the 2 1/2-mile track. ""I knew I had a fast car."" Bleacher Report: Johnson finds way to win . His crew chief, Chad Knaus said that despite the uncertainty of racing this season with the latest generation of NASCAR cars -- which are lighter and sleeker -- they knew for weeks what they wanted to do. ""Jimmie did a great job of following that plan,"" said Knaus, who sat out the team's 2006 Daytona 500 win because of a suspension. Bleacher Report's snap reaction . Danica Patrick, the first woman to win the pole position at the Daytona 500, led three times, including five laps under green -- also becoming the first woman to lead a lap at the race not under a yellow flag caution. She finished eighth, the highest finish ever for a female driver at the race. ""At the end of the day, it was a solid day,"" she said. ""We stayed basically in the top 10 all day, so it was nice."" Crew chief Tony Gibson beamed after the race. ""She did great under pressure,"" he said. Bleacher Report: Danica Patrick proves her chops . Earnhardt did his best to earn his second win in the ""Great American Race,"" but his last-lap charge came up short. With just over a mile to go, Earhardt, followed by veteran driver Mark Martin, went low on the track. With Martin's car pushing Earnhardt's the two pushed into contention, but Johnson maneuvered in front of his teammate Earnhardt. The 54-year-old Martin crossed the finish line third. ""We just kinda ran out of steam out of (turn) four,"" Earnhardt said. ""We made a good move, but there just was not enough race track."" Some of the fans who were injured by flying debris Saturday during a crash late in the Nationwide Series Drive4COPD 300 were to attend the Daytona 500, speedway president Joie Chitwood said Sunday morning. At least 28 fans were injured when more than a dozen cars piled up in the final curve of Saturday's race. Some of the debris went over a 22-foot-high fence that was built in 2010, and some of it went through holes as the fence was mangled when a car slammed into it and bounced back onto the track. Saturday's wreck occurred when several closely packed cars were jostling for position at top speeds of about 175 mph. They got tangled up, setting off a dangerous chain reaction that ensnared several vehicles. Driver Kyle Larson's vehicle ended up flying into a fence that separates the track from spectators. The car broke into pieces, including tires and a fiery engine. Larson walked away from the crash, even after the front part of his No. 32 car was gone. He and the other nine drivers involved told reporters that they were checked at a medical tent on the Daytona infield and released.","Jimmie Johnson led 17 laps, says he was confident in his car .

"(CNN) -- ""Bikinis and big booties, y'all. That's what life is about,"" professes Alien, the be-grilled, white Camaro-driving rapper played by James Franco in Harmony Korine's ""Spring Breakers"" (in theaters Friday). Add baby-pink ski masks and more than a little gunplay to the mix, and we're off. The art-sleaze film about the decadent rites of American college kids stars former Disney sweethearts Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens alongside ""Pretty Little Liars' "" Ashley Benson and Korine's wife, Rachel, as broke coeds who stick up a chicken shack to fund the spring break of their dreams. When the partying goes too far and the girls find themselves in jail in St. Petersburg, Florida, it's Alien who bails them out and introduces them to a life that's both darker and more tender than they ever knew. The DayGlo- and dubstep-fueled assault on the senses was written by Korine (""Kids,"" ""Trash Humpers"") while doing some immersion research in a hotel room in Panama City, Florida, where, he told an audience at the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, ""people were blasting Taylor Swift music 24 hours a day, vomiting on my door and snorting donuts. It was crazy."" ""It's a very base culture,"" he continued, ""and I thought there was some kind of strange poetry in it as well."" The scenes of spring break, raunchy displays of grinding bodies and guys spilling beer into topless girls' mouths from crotch level, were taken from real-life festivities. ""Some of the scenes we were shooting, and you see we're in the motel room, and all of us are just completely covering our mouths and shocked -- that was all real,"" Gomez said. ""We were witnessing things that were happening that were absolutely crazy and reacting in the realest way."" ""The images were hypersexualized, hyperviolent,"" Korine said, ""and then the subject matter was all the details: The bikinis and the book bags and the flip-flops and the Hello Kitty bags and the nail polish and the neons and the stickers and the glasses were all real childlike, innocent. I thought it was interesting, both of those things working together. It's a nice backdrop but also a metaphor for what happens later in the film once they meet Alien and what the movie becomes."" Though Faith, Gomez's comparatively pious character, scans as someone who might have grown out of the ""Wizards of Waverly Place"" and Justin Bieber trajectory, she explained that she chose the role because ""I wanted to see how far I could go."" Benson said, ""People are used to seeing us in certain roles, and this was a movie where we were able to show people a different side of us, and it was more exciting than anything."" Hudgens added that their characters are ""a little bit psychotic in their own right, but it's such a liberating experience to be able to do a movie like this."" But, Gomez cautioned, ""I don't necessarily want to know what people are going to say or think"" about her choice. ""It's just better that way. I can't really make anyone happy. I'm an actor, and I love what I do, so if I want to do something I'm super passionate about, I'm just going to go for it. If people like it, awesome. If not, at least we made them feel something.""

In December, days after the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting spree that left 20 children and seven adults dead, more than half of the nation favored stricter gun control laws, according to national polls. Less than six months later, that number dwindled to just over 40%. Several national polls show that roughly 90% of Americans support some form of universal background checks. However, that provision has faced intense pushback from some lawmakers and is a major sticking point even as Senate leader Harry Reid scheduled a vote Thursday to block the filibuster on comprehensive gun control reform. CNN Poll: Background checks popular, worrisome . Instead, those negotiators may be on the verge of putting forth a watered-down version of background checks in order to salvage the broader gun control package wending through that chamber. Though FBI background checks are required for commercial sales, the proposal being considered would expand them to gun shows and internet sales, but they would not require checks for other private transactions, according to multiple sources familiar with the talks. Is this how democracy works? ""If our democracy's working the way it's supposed to and 90% of the American people agree on something, in the wake of a tragedy, you'd think this would not be a heavy lift,"" an exasperated President Obama said in West Hartford, Connecticut, on Monday. But the gun control debate — with its at times befuddling plot twists — highlights what many are loathe to admit: This is the way democracy works. Or at least this is the way democracy has worked with such similarly controversial measures as the Affordable Care Act and the bank bailouts — both of which were pushed through despite public opposition. Public opinion doesn't always equate to a legislative outcome. Yes, the gun control advocates are buoyed by the outrage of a grieving nation and a presidential administration's powerful push. But the gun-rights advocates are backed by the powerful gun lobby and a motivated and vocal interest group -- the NRA. Add to that the public's confusion about current gun laws, said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, and it's a recipe for gridlock. Hope grows for compromise proposal on gun control . ""It's the usual stuff,"" Vernick said. ""Historically politicians have feared even the smaller group of pro-gun folks more than the pro-gun violence prevention movement."" That's because the gun advocates are motivated by that single issue and are far more likely than their more liberal-leaning gun control counterparts to be outspoken on that particular issue, policy experts said. ""What happens is that the gun owners, the gun enthusiasts are one-issue voters, and there's been research done that shows that if you ask gun owners if they oppose gun control and you ask how vehement they are, they say 'it matters,'"" said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the State University of New York at Albany's School of Criminal Justice. ""Then you ask 'what have you done in opposing gun control.' They say 'I donated money. I wrote to my congressman. I've called my senator.'"" Those who support stricter gun controls are motivated by a broader mix of issues. ""When you ask the gun control people the same thing they're like 'what do you mean.' They have a bunch of things that matter,"" Lizotte said. NRA 'plucks the bird' to weaken gun proposals . Gun rights voters are aided by the targeted efforts of the National Rifle Association, which has more than 4.3 million members. The powerful gun lobby and its allies in Congress use a sophisticated campaign -- constantly shifting the focus of the battle among various provisions, raising new arguments to old issues and proposing solutions that would expand weapons use and training instead of increasing regulation. The NRA also exerts its political clout through a rating system that identifies friends and foes of its positions in Congress and directs substantial contributions to political campaigns it favors or opponents of candidates it dislikes. From gun hater to NRA-loving mom . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, who received an A-rating by the NRA, has joined roughly a dozen similarly high-scoring Republicans in threatening to block Democrat-backed gun control legislation. Mayors Against Illegal Guns -- the group co-chaired by wealthy New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg battling the NRA in the recent gun control debate -- is using its opponent's tactics against them, creating their own grading system for lawmakers, some of them facing re-election next year. ""At the end of the day, these guys represent their states, not the country,"" said Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor at the Cook Political Report. ""They need to be in step with their constituents."" Outmatched . Sometimes, even when those constituents vocally advocate for stricter gun control laws, they find themselves outmatched. Rob ""Biko"" Baker, executive director of the League of Young Voters, a group which targets non-college, minority youth and encourages them to vote, said he remembers the NRA showing up at a community meeting with the families of gun violence victims in the predominantly black and urban north side of Milwaukee. ""It was on MLK Drive and they showed up two-to-one. They showed up with the slick talking. We knew they were going to come deep, but we thought we were going to out organize them,"" Baker said. Ultimately, the measure Baker's group was pushing — a proposal to require background checks of all gun purchases — failed to even get out of committee in the Wisconsin statehouse. Should anyone be allowed to buy guns? Share your views . ""We were making a common sense argument that black men are being targeted,"" Baker said. ""It was pretty disheartening. I've gotta walk the streets and talk to the mothers, and they still have open wounds."" Looking at the polls, the ones that President Obama pointed to as proof of the country's broad support for his agenda on gun control, doesn't tell the full story either. ""In every Quinnipiac University poll since the Newtown massacre, nationally and in six states, we find overwhelming support, including among gun owners, for universal background checks,"" said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. ""American voters agree with the National Rifle Association, however, that these background checks could lead someday to confiscation of legally owned guns."" By a 48%-38% margin, voters in a Quinnipiac University survey said that the government could use the information from universal background checks to confiscate legally owned guns. And gun owners believe 53%-34% that the checks could lead to confiscation of legal guns. There's also a partisan divide on the question, with 61% of Republicans, 51% of independents and 32% of Democrats expecting confiscations. Opinion: Why the NRA fights background checks . The battleground of the states . As blue states like Colorado, Maryland and New York take on tougher restrictions on gun purchases and expand background checks, red states are considering pre-emptive laws to nullify a possible federal assault weapons ban. The types of gun control measures that easily sailed through the state legislature in Maryland faced huge hurdles, sparked protests and even drew in such national players as Vice President Joe Biden and gun manufacturer Magpul Industries in Colorado. Even as Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper was signing into law stricter gun control measures, the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners Group was giving away ""a Winchester Super X Pump Marine Defender 12 Gauge Shotgun, courtesy of our friends at Cornerstone Arms in Colorado Springs"" and several ""Gen-M2 PMAGS"" on its Facebook page. ""It's a promotional giveaway,"" said Dudley Brown, executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners. ""It looked like there was a chance of banning semiautomatic assault rifles, so it was an in your face 'OK then we'll give them away then,'"" The group says it plans on giving away more guns and ammo between now and when the new laws take effect on July 1. They also are focusing on federal lawmakers they feel might cave to efforts to pass stricter gun control laws. ""There are a number of weak-willed Republicans in the House, and we don't want them to feel they have wind in their sails,"" Brown said. ""We're going to make Republicans pay the price. We are going to hold them accountable for their votes. Nothing is going to be done in secret. The days of smoke-filled rooms where even the institutional gun lobbies cut deals is over."" CNN's Dana Bash, Tom Cohen and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Days after Newtown, more than half of the nation favored stricter gun control laws .

"(CNN) -- Saturday was all about Lionel Messi as the Barcelona striker scored for a record 17th consecutive game in Spain's La Liga but on Sunday Cristiano Ronaldo answered with two goals of his own to continue his remarkable streak for Real Madrid. The Portuguese striker grabbed both goals as Real won 2-1 at Celta Vigo which takes his record for the club to 188 goals in 186 games. Jose Mourinho's side have now won six games in a row, including twice against Barcelona and a decisive victory against Manchester United to take them into the last eight of the European Champions League. Despite their victory Real still sit 13 points behind runaway leaders Barca, and have their sights set on a cup double -- in Europe's top club competition and Spain's most prestigious cup tournament, the Copa del Rey. Real went close twice in the first half through France forward Karim Benzema, both chances supplied by Ronaldo, but he turned finisher on the hour mark when he turned and finished from close range after a deflection in the area. But Celta, who are deep in relegation trouble, pulled level just two minutes later when Iago Aspas' shot took a deflection off Portuguese defender Pepe and squirmed past Diego Lopez. Real restored their advantage when Celta goalkeeper Javi Varas brought down Brazil playmaker Kaka and Ronaldo stepped up to score his 25th league goal of the season -- 15 behind Messi's league tally. Substitute Gonzalo Higuain missed a glorious chance to put the game beyond doubt when he somehow contrived to miss from six yards out after a perfect center from Germany international Mesut Ozil. And Real were nearly made to pay as Celta's on loan Arsenal forward Park Chu-Young, from South Korea, headed against the crossbar late in the game. Real's win moved them into second place after city rivals Atletico Madrid suffered a shock 1-0 home defeat by Real Sociedad. Xabi Prieto scored the only goal of the game as Atletico sank to third, one point behind Real. Elsewhere, Iker Munian's late goal handed Athletic Bilbao a much-needed victory over Valencia while Levante and Getafe drew 0-0. In Italy, an injury time goal from Emanuele Giaccherini sent Juventus six points clear at the top of Serie A and consigned Catania to their ninth league defeat of the season. Juve's day got better when second placed Napoli went down 2-0 at Chievo Verona after goals from Boukary Drame and Cyril Thereau. Napoli striker Edinson Cavani missed a penalty to get his side back into the game. Inter Milan went down to a surprise 1-0 home defeat to Bologna thanks to Alberto Gilardino's 57th minute goal. Inter dropped to fifth after Fiorentina's 2-0 win at Lazio. Segundo Ibardo scored a hat-trick as Cagliari beat Sampdoria 3-1, while there were also wins for Atalanta, Siena and Parma. In Germany, Hannover drew 0-0 with Eintracht Frankfurt while Artjoms Rudnevs' goal helped Hamburg to a 1-0 victory at Stuttgart. In France, Marseille and Lyon drew 0-0 while there were wins for Bordeaux and Nice.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores twice as Real Madrid beat Celta Vigo 2-1 in La Liga .

"(CNN) -- The Louisville Cardinals defeated the Michigan Wolverines, 82-76, to win the NCAA Division I men's basketball championship Monday night in Atlanta. The showdown was one for the ages, with a dazzling array of airborne theatrics, jaw-dropping dunks and 3-pointers from well behind the line. The Cardinals surged from a double-digit deficit in the first half to lead during much of the second half and finally clinch the victory. Pitino gets Hall of Fame nod . Louisville Head Coach Rick Pitino said his team was able to top the Wolverines' ""absolutely incredible"" performance ""probably because I have the 13 toughest guys I've ever coached."" The Cardinals played without Kevin Ware, the sophomore guard who suffered one of the most grotesque injuries in college sports while playing Duke on March 31. During a routine block attempt, Ware landed awkwardly and snapped his right shin, drawing gasps of horror as the bone protruded through his skin. Ware joined his teammates during the championship trophy presentation on crutches. ""These are my brothers, you know. They got the job done, and I'm so proud of them."" Ware's teammate Luke Hancock was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, helping pull Louisville out of a 12-point hole to lead the Cardinals with 22 points. ""We just went into war right there against a great Michigan team,"" the junior forward said. Naismith Trophy winner Trey Burke led a ferocious Michigan squad with 24 points, but it wasn't enough to top No. 1 seed Louisville. Now, Pitino must live up to a promise he made to his players this season. ""They said, 'If you win the national championship, coach, you're getting a tattoo.'

"NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Employees at the Seattle office of the U.S. Government Accountability Office know that they have to put in 80 hours of work every two weeks. Some employers understand that your working at the expense of everything else in your life isn't good for you ... or for them. But they can configure those hours pretty much how they'd like, with the exception of the one day a week their managers require all employees to be at the office at the same time. Plus, they can work from home for some of the week, or they can work compressed weeks so that they can take every fifth or 10th day off and still log their 80 hours. Those policies are why that GAO office is among the recipients of the Alfred P. Sloan awards for excellence in workplace flexibility given by the Families and Work Institute (FWI) every year. Three-quarters of big organizations now offer flexible-work benefits, according to Hewitt Associates. Watson Wyatt in its survey of mid- and large-sized companies found that flexible work schedules was the most commonly offered benefit, followed by telecommuting and compressed work weeks. But just because an HR policy exists doesn't mean that your employer has your back if you're afraid to take advantage of it. That's why FWI recognizes employers that have flexibility policies that are both innovative and regularly used by employees. Here are just a few examples from among FWI's 2007 winners. At Amerisure Insurance Company's Detroit office, all employees have some flexibility in their schedules, even those staffing call centers. They can choose the hours they work between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., which lets them, for instance, pick up or drop off their kids during the day. At the 16-member Bailey Law Group in Washington, D.C., telecommuting isn't a problem, even from across the country. Rather than lose two of its best employees, who were moving to other states, the firm's founder, Kathy Bailey, let them work remotely from their new homes. Bailey told FWI that she attributes the tripling of her company's revenue in part to the firm's flexibility, noting that one of the relocated employees brought in a whole new roster of clients as a result of the move. Intel makes its money on innovation, and burn-out rarely produces innovative ideas. That's why employees at the company's Chandler, Arizona, office get two paid consecutive months off every seven years. They also get reimbursed for tuition if they're pursuing further education and can use company time to pursue a degree, either by using comp time or making up for the time spent in class by working on evenings or weekends. Sabbaticals are also an option at NRG, a small insurance firm in Seattle with 14 employees. They get an extra month's vacation for every five years they work and may take two consecutive months off during their sabbatical year. Regular and flexible time-off is critical, too, especially when salaries aren't huge and talented employees can make more elsewhere. At the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), employees start with two-and-a-half weeks' vacation and after three years, get a full month. They also can roll over any of their unused sick days (they get 13 a year) and use them for any medical need, including taking care of a sick family member, or for bereavement. At no time do you appreciate your employer's flexibility more than when you need to take time to care for a child or handle a family crisis. Under federal law, companies with at least 50 employees must let employees take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year to care for a new baby, a sick family member or their own medical problems. This week, the author of that legislation, Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Connecticut), co-sponsored a bill calling for companies to provide 8 of those 12 weeks to be paid. At Ernst &Young's Chicago office, new mothers with at least a year's tenure at the firm get three paid months of leave plus up to 19 weeks of unpaid leave. New fathers get six weeks of paid leave if they are the primary caregiver, two weeks if they are not. For employees who adopt, they get 16 weeks of leave, of which six are paid if the employee is the primary caregiver, or two otherwise But then an additional four weeks of paid leave is available when the primary parent goes back to work. For parents who choose to leave their jobs, Ernst & Young stays in touch, calling them when new work opportunities at the firm arise. Employees caring for a close relative, meanwhile, can take up to 16 weeks of leave without fear of losing their jobs. The payoff for the firm is huge. Deanna Bassett, the accounting firm's Inclusion and Flexibility Leader, told FWI, ""The cost of our flexibility practices is nothing compared to the cost of losing good people and hiring and training new ones.""

"London (CNN) -- Authorities in Britain arrested three people Thursday in two meat plants amid an investigation into the sale of horse meat as beef in Europe. French prosecutors continue to investigate, the country's consumer affairs minister said. The announcement comes as UK inspectors said that horse carcasses contaminated with an equine painkiller harmful to humans may have entered the food chain in France. A number of meat plants that handled the horse meat as it made its way through the food chain are facing questions about what they knew and whether fraud was involved. The arrests in Britain involved workers at Farmbox Meats near Aberystywth and Peter Boddy Slaughterhouse in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, the country's Food Standards Agency said. Inspectors toured the plants Tuesday and suspended their permits to operate on Wednesday, the agency said. The three men were arrested under the Fraud Act and are being detained at a police station, where they will be questioned by police and FSA investigators, according to the agency. It's the latest twist in a Europe-wide crisis over rogue horse meat in beef products. Over the past week, unauthorized horse meat has been discovered in a variety of products labeled as beef that were sold in supermarkets in countries including Britain, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany and Ireland. French Consumer Affairs Minister Benoit Hamon said Thursday that the French firm Spanghero should have known that the meat it labeled as beef was actually horse. Spanghero was the first company to label the meat as beef, the minister said, adding that 750 tons of horse meat were involved over a period of at least six months. Spanghero should have identified the meat as horse from its Romanian customs code, as well as its appearance, smell and price, he said. The matter has been passed to the Paris prosecutor to be investigated as fraud, Hamon said. The offense is punishable by up to two years in prison and fines of up to 187,500 euros for the companies involved. Hamon said there was no reason to doubt that the Romanian supplier of the horse meat was acting in good faith. Before it reached Spanghero, the horse meat also passed through the hands of a Dutch company, Draap Trading, run by Jan Fasen. Fasen had previously been imprisoned for meat trafficking, Hamon said. CNN has not been able to reach Draap Trading for comment. Hamon said another firm implicated in the scandal, Comigel, should also have noticed anomalies in labeling of the meat it received. A Spanghero representative said the company acted in good faith. ""The company has never ordered horse meat and we never knowingly sold on horse meat,"" the representative said. Fears over the rogue horse meat surfaced after it was discovered that eight out of 206 horse carcasses checked between January 30 and February 7 tested positive for the drug phenylbutazone, widely known as bute, the UK Food Standards Agency said. EU health chief vows plan to restore confidence in wake of horse meat scandal . Of these, six went to France, raising concerns they may have entered the food chain there. The agency is working with French authorities to try to trace the six carcasses, which were slaughtered at an abattoir in Somerset, England. The two others that tested positive, at a different slaughterhouse, did not leave the premises and have been disposed of, the agency said. What's behind the horse meat contamination scandal? Bute is not allowed to enter the human food chain. The drug is no longer approved for human use in the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration website says, because ""some patients treated with phenylbutazone have experienced severe toxic reactions."" The drug can cause various blood conditions and is a carcinogen, the FDA says. But the UK's chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, sought to reassure worried consumers. It is ""extremely unlikely"" that anyone who has consumed affected horse meat will suffer harmful side effects, she said in a statement Thursday. ""Phenylbutazone... is a commonly used medicine in horses. It is also prescribed to some patients who are suffering from a severe form of arthritis,"" Davies added. British authorities raid slaughterhouse over horse meat scandal . ""At the levels of bute that have been found, a person would have to eat 500 to 600 burgers a day that are 100% horse meat to get close to consuming a human's daily dose. And it passes through the system fairly quickly, so it is unlikely to build up in our bodies,"" she explained. German supermarket chain Real confirmed Wednesday that samples of a frozen beef lasagna had tested positive for horse meat. Fellow supermarket chains Rewe and Tengelmann said they are examining certain beef products as a precaution. Ministers met for emergency talks in Brussels, Belgium, on Wednesday on how to tackle a crisis that has thrown the European meat industry into disarray. Battle over blame after horse meat found in beef products . It was already reeling from a bombshell last month, when Irish investigators found horse and pig DNA in a number of hamburger products. The discovery of pig DNA in beef products is of particular concern to Jews and Muslims, whose dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork products. Jewish dietary laws also ban the eating of horse meat. After Wednesday's talks, Irish Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney said the ministers had agreed to implement measures including random DNA testing of processed beef products across the European Union's 27 member states. The United Kingdom is awaiting the outcome of ""authenticity"" tests on beef products ordered last week by the Food Standards Agency across the UK food industry. The results are due by Friday. Investigations into what could be criminal fraud somewhere in the supply chain also are being led by Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency. UK Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who met with Europol officials Thursday, said, ""This is an incredibly important step. It's increasingly clear that this case reaches right across Europe. ""It's clear that Europol is the right organization to coordinate efforts to uncover all wrongdoing and bring criminals to justice, wherever there may be."" Meanwhile, steps have been taken to tighten up the legitimate slaughter of horses in the United Kingdom. Beginning January 30, the Food Standards Agency ordered 100% testing of horse carcasses, and, as of this week, their meat will not be allowed to enter the food chain until the all-clear has been given. Previously, a random sample was tested. In 2012, 6% of horse carcasses tested positive for bute, the agency said. CNN's Antonia Mortensen, Susannah Palk and Erin McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Three people are arrested in the British horse meat investigation .

"(CNN) -- North Korea said Tuesday its missiles can reach the U.S. mainland -- days after South Korea announced a deal with the United States to extend its missile range. The strike zone of North Korean rocket forces includes ""not only the bases of the puppet forces and the U.S. imperialist aggression forces' bases in the inviolable land of Korea, but also Japan, Guam and the U.S. mainland,"" the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported. But some analysts questioned the claim. ""That's been a desire or an objective, politically, for North Korean leadership for quite some time. But they have not demonstrated that capability,"" said Daniel Pinkston of the International Crisis Group's North East Asia Program. ""To acquire that capability requires a lot of development and testing. And considering what they've done so far ... I don't find that credible. But I do think they're working toward acquiring that capability."" North Korean soldier shoots comrades, defects to South . The claim from Pyongyang comes amid increased tensions between the two Koreas after the North test fired a long-range rocket in April. That rocket exploded shortly after it was launched. North Korea insisted it was trying to launch a satellite into orbit, but the attempt was widely viewed as a cover for a ballistic missile test. Analysts say the country's latest threat isn't surprising after South Korea announced it reached a deal with the United States that allows Seoul to extend the range of its ballistic missiles. ""What else can they say? It was politically impossible for them not to react,"" said professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul. On Sunday, South Korea said it reached a deal with the United States that allows Seoul to extend the range of its ballistic missiles to include the northern peninsula of North Korea. The deal with Washington revised the range of Seoul's missiles from 300 kilometers (186 miles) to 800 kilometers (497 miles), South Korean national security adviser Chun Yung-woo told reporters. ""The important goal in revising the missile pact is to deter armed provocation from North Korea,"" Chun said. ""If North Korea is to attack or provoke, we are able to incapacitate its nuclear and missile (capabilities) in the early stage. We have guaranteed various capabilities to protect the life and safety of our people."" The South agreed in 1972 to limit its missile range to 180 kilometers (112 miles) in exchange for access to U.S. missile technology. Guidelines were revised in 2001 to allow for a range of 300 kilometers. The two Koreas signed an armistice that ended the 1950-1953 Korean war, though a peace treaty was never signed. Technically, the two countries remain in a state of war. Roughly 28,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea. South Korea says U.S. agrees to extend Seoul's ballistic missile range .

"(CNN) -- One year ago this week, President Barack Obama launched the Atrocities Prevention Board to find ways to get ahead of the kind of crisis we're seeing in Syria, and the kind we witnessed in Darfur and Rwanda. The board's aim is to shift U.S. foreign policy away from responding to atrocities to preventing them; to oversee the development of prevention and response policy, and to deal with urgent situations as they arise. The board is under the chairmanship of the National Security Council and is a result of a decades-long effort by the global anti-genocide community. It marks its one-year anniversary 10 years after the genocide began in Darfur, and nearly 20 years after Rwanda. Given the changing nature of warfare, the board -- and the 12 agencies that compose it, including State, Defense, Homeland Security, CIA, and the Agency for International Development -- also was charged with suggesting ways in which conflict prevention could be more nimble and effective. The problem, however, is that we're still using hardware to fix a software problem. And we're not particularly nimble. In a fast-moving, interconnected, and open-information world, anticipating and preventing armed conflict or mass atrocities requires tools that are equally as fast, flexible and high-impact as the modern perpetrators of violence. We don't need new targeted sanctions programs, visa bans, or expanded military authorizations. These are old tools, more reflective of an outdated, hard-powered and overly militarized approach to engagement than those needed to counter 21st-century security threats. The tools we need are people who are well-trained, technologically connected, fully empowered and well-resourced in hot spots throughout the world. These people, American and local, collect our intelligence, design and inform our early warning systems, quell political unrest through diplomacy and development, and train the next generation of leaders in conflict regions to read and write, legislate and litigate, reignite broken economies and repair eroded social fabric. What work did we do in the last 10 years in Syria or Libya to empower civil society in conflict prevention, invest robustly in strengthening governance, access to justice and the rule of law, and expand information networks and open communication? We did very little. This work -- building human capacity in countries in turmoil and expanding systems for information sharing -- is the single most cost-effective approach to atrocity prevention when the true objective is sustainable peace. And yet we have left meager footprints on these fronts in Afghanistan or Iraq. As the Atrocity Prevention Board begins its second year, the road ahead must be redesigned to better reflect these recommendations. If we want to prevent more situations like Syria, we must work closely with Congress to protect or increase funding for the State Department's Conflict Stabilization Operations and the Complex Crises Fund, international organizations, transition initiatives, and programs focused on access to justice, governance and security reform, human rights and social inclusion. How do we get Congress to fund this critical atrocities prevention work in the age of sequesters and cost-cutting measures? Engage the American public. The public will be essential for atrocities prevention efforts to succeed. The American public is behind us on this. According to a poll by the U.S. Holocaust Museum, seven in 10 Americans think the United States should prevent or stop genocide or mass atrocities from happening in another part of the world. Engagement with the American public is an untapped resource of support. Yet, a year after the board was established, a clear mechanism for civil society to engage in its work does not exist. We commend the Obama administration -- along with civil society, international institutions, think tanks and academics and activists in anti-genocide and prevention -- for their efforts to advance our national understanding of modern day conflict, and our ability to respond in a truly paradigm-shifting way. The Atrocities Prevention Board filled a major hole in U.S. foreign policy and sets a promising trajectory for increasing the U.S. and international community's ability to prevent mass atrocities. But more work is needed. Now it is time to take that commitment to the next level by issuing an executive order spelling out the U.S. government's strategy for preventing mass atrocities and the key tasks of those charged with making it happen. We can stop the next genocide. We can prevent the next violent conflict. But to do so, we have to commit the resources early, not after atrocities have already started. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","President set up Atrocities Prevention Board to get ahead of potential genocides .

"(CNN) -- Benedict XVI's shock resignation in February -- the first for almost 600 years -- sent experts inside and outside the Vatican rushing to consult church law to work out what will happen next. The ensuing conclave fever has unearthed some quirky facts alongside the more significant. Here's a selection to drop into conversation. Conclave means ""with key."" The elaborate voting process dates to the early Middle Ages and was born out of frustration after a gathering of cardinals took nearly three years to select a pope. The locals got so fed up, they tore the roof off the building where the cardinals were meeting and then decided to lock the cardinals in, to speed up a decision. Why cardinals once took three years to choose pope . Bread and water . Eventually Pope Gregory X was chosen. He wanted to avoid a repeat of his own experience and thus the conclave became a tradition. Cardinals in the future would get only one dish at their noon and evening meal if they took more than three days to decide ... and only bread, water, and wine if it went beyond eight. Gone are those food restrictions but Pope Gregory would be proud, more recently, that the cardinals have, on average, chosen a pope in roughly three days. Renaissance luxury . While Gregory X's approach had been to make conditions so spartan that the cardinals were pressured into making a decision fast, historian and author Frederic Baumgartner said the cardinals of the Renaissance expected to live more comfortably. They moved the conclave from the Papal Archbasilica of St. John Lateran -- or the Lateran Palace -- to the Vatican because the palace had become so rickety. Voting was initially held in the Vatican's Pauline Chapel but since 1878 the Sistine Chapel has consistently been the venue. Conclave doctor . While the cardinal-electors are locked in the Sistine Chapel on their own for the actual balloting process, they're not entirely alone for the length of the conclave. Alongside officials such as the Secretary of the College of Cardinals and masters of ceremonies, priests must be available for hearing confessions, two medical doctors for possible emergencies, and an adequate team of domestic staff to prepare and serve meals, and for general housekeeping, according to Monsignor Charles Burns. In his guide to the conclave Msgr. Burns said these staff are also bound to observe total confidentiality and must swear an oath in Italian. Male and unmarried? There is nothing to prohibit votes being cast for someone outside the College of Cardinals. CNN's Vatican expert John Allen said any person who would be eligible for ordination to the Catholic priesthood -- therefore an unmarried male -- could be elected as pope. But he said in practice the new pope will be elected from among the cardinals who are voting. Only one man elected pope has not been a cardinal. Archbishop Bartolomeo Prignano of Bari in Italy was named Pope Urban VI back in 1378. Msgr. Burns warned that this led to the Great Western Schism, which divided Christendom for almost 40 years -- until Pope Gregory XII's resignation. Bookmakers are also allowing bets on outsiders ranging from U2 singer Bono to disgraced American cyclist Lance Armstrong to lead the church. The 10,000-1 odds are perhaps an indication that the outcome of the conclave will remain traditional. Gambling with God: Staking a wager on the next pope . Italian advantage? Italians have clearly had the home field advantage, dominating the papacy through the centuries. The conclave of 1978 produced the closest thing to a genuine surprise we've had in decades, in John Paul II, the first non-Italian in 500 years. And while the election of this Polish cardinal was a shock, the cardinal electors had looked outside Italy before, though not often. In 1492, the conclave selected a Spaniard, Pope Alexander VI ... and in previous centuries, a pope was chosen from Syria and another from the Netherlands. Why me? Behind Michelangelo's ""Last Judgement"" painting lies the Sala de Lacrima -- the Room of Tears, where the newly elected pope goes to change out of his red cardinals robes into the white vestments of the pope. Fr. Christopher Whitehead said the room was so-named ""because the poor man obviously breaks down at being elected."" What to wear, what to wear . Msgr. Burns said three sizes of soutane, large, medium and small, would be laid out in the Sala de Lacrima, ready to be adjusted to fit the pope-elect. If he is not already a bishop, the Dean of the College of Cardinals would ordain him. Red slippers . Constantine the Great gave popes the privileges of emperors -- meaning they could wear red shoes. It had been believed that Benedict's slippers were made by Italian fashion house Prada. CNN's Christiane Amanpour revealed that it was not in fact so. And Dan Rivers spoke to a Peruvian cobbler as well as some designers responsible for the papal robes. Wrong ransacking . Baumgartner said there had been a tradition that the residents of Rome would ransack the dwelling of the cardinal that was elected to be pope -- on the grounds that he didn't need it anymore. There was at least one example of the Roman people ransacking the house of the wrong cardinal, during the 400 to 500 years the tradition was followed, he said. ""Not only did he not become pope but he didn't have anything left in his house."" You have been watching . Vatican spokesman the Rev. Tom Rosica told CNN that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI watched on television as cardinals took their oath of secrecy in the Sistine Chapel to begin the conclave to elect his successor, and also saw on television the black smoke from the Sistine Chapel Tuesday night to indicate they had not agreed on anyone yet. Definitely not Peter . It wasn't until the end of the 10th century that the head of the church started taking a different name to the one he was born with, said eminent Italian church historian Alberto Melloni. But since then only one, Adrian VI in the 16th century, has kept his baptismal name. In the long history of popes, stretching back two millennia to St. Peter, some names have picked up negative associations, while others have come to signify conservatism or a desire for change. While we wait to hear what the 266th pope of the Roman Catholic church will call himself, we can be sure of only one thing, according to Melloni: the new pope will not be called Peter. This is out of respect for the first St. Peter, the Apostle -- but perhaps also reflects a centuries' old prophecy that a Peter II will be the very last pope to serve.","115 cardinal-electors are gathered in the Sistine Chapel to choose a new pope .
Conclave follows the resignation of Benedict and is conducted in secrecy .
In theory, any unmarried male Catholic could be elected as pope .

"(CNN) -- The judge in the court-martial of an Army psychiatrist charged in a deadly shooting spree on a Texas military base rejected options presented by his lawyers under which he would plead guilty and ordered the trial to begin in May. Maj. Nidal Hasan is charged with killing 13 people at Fort Hood in November 2009, called the worst incident of its kind on a military base. Col. Tara Osborn on Wednesday ruled that pre-trial publicity around the case would not unfairly prejudice a jury and set the start of jury selection for May 29. Testimony is scheduled to begin July 1. Hasan's lawyers filed motions indicating that he was willing to plead guilty under three potential scenarios. Details of the proposals, including the counts involved, were not immediately clear. But Osborn turned them down, saying it would be tantamount to admitting guilt to a capital offense, which is not permitted under military law. Hasan, who was paralyzed from the waist down in an exchange of gunfire with police, appeared bearded and thinner when he arrived for the pretrial hearing in a wheelchair. The attack that resulted in murder and attempted murder charges against him occurred at the post's processing center, where soldiers were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan and Iraq. 2012: U.S. asks court to deny Fort Hood shooter's appeal . Prosecutors aim to show that Hasan was a radical Islamist. Investigations have found that he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, a prominent radical Yemeni-American cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011. And much of Wednesday's hearing was devoted to questioning a potential expert witness for the prosecution, Evan Kohlmann, an international terrorism expert who apparently examined the contents of a laptop belonging to Hasan. Kohlmann said he found examples of websites and YouTube videos that could indicate someone trying to learn more about radical Islam. He said there was ""no indication that anyone other than Hasan used the laptop."" One item on the laptop that was cited by Kohlmann linked to a YouTube video of a 2009 CNN report featuring the network's national security analyst, Peter Bergen, talking about a newly released audio tape from Osama bin Laden. Defense lawyers, who want to keep Kohlmann off the stand at trial and sought to undercut his methodology and conclusions, introduced their own expert witness who said that only a portion of the CNN report had been viewed. The start of Hasan's court-martial has been repeatedly delayed since it was initially set to begin in March 2012, most notably after an appeals court delayed the case over the question of whether the Army major's beard could be forcibly shaved. Army regulations prevent soldiers from wearing facial hair while in uniform. Hasan, who is still considered a soldier, is a practicing Muslim and maintains he has the right to wear the beard under U.S. laws protecting religious freedoms. 2012: Fort Hood suspect's beard focus of another hearing . The case resumed after a higher court dismissed the order that Hasan be shaved and replaced the judge in the case. If convicted, Hasan faces a possible death penalty. A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, he was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997. He had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings, but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military. Hasan had told his family he had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Investigations tied to the Fort Hood shootings found he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, a prominent radical Yemeni-American cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011. 2012: Fort Hood shooting victims want rampage labeled as terrorism . 2012: Military judge removed from Fort Hood shooter case . 2012: U.S. asks court to deny Fort Hood shooter's appeal .","NEW: Judge rejects options for plea offers from Hasan's lawyers .

"(TIME.com) -- Alzheimer's disease is more common among African Americans but the genetic contributors to the disorder haven't been identified until now. In the largest study of genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's in the African American population, researchers reporting in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that two genes associated with higher risk of the neurodegenerative disorder among whites also contributed to higher rates of the disease among African Americans. Changes in these genes, however, conferred a higher risk of disease among African Americans than among whites. In the study involving nearly 6,000 African American participants aged 60 or older, about 2,000 of whom had Alzheimer's and 4,000 who did not, variants in the genes ABCA7 and ApoE increased risk of developing Alzheimer's by 80% and more than two fold, respectively. By comparison, ABCA7 is likely responsible for a 10% to 20% increased risk for the memory-robbing disorder within white populations, and about 40% of whites with certain forms of ApoE are diagnosed with Alzheimer's. TIME.com: Two studies find promising new ways to detect Alzheimer's earlier . ABCA7â€²s role in the Alzheimer's doesn't come as a complete surprise; it is involved in producing cholesterol and lipids, and some research suggests that Alzheimer's disease may involve aberrations in fat metabolism that are similar to those behind heart disease. The more prominent contribution that ABCA7 seems to play in Alzheimer's risk among African Americans, however, does suggest that such lipid-based pathways may be more important in this population than among whites. ABCA7 also regulates transport of proteins, including those responsible for the production of amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer's when it builds up in sticky plaques in the brain. TIME.com: Study shows Alzheimer's protein may not spread like a virus . More studies are needed to confirm the role that these genetic variants play in contributing to Alzheimer's in the African American population, but if the associations are confirmed, they could lead to more refined ways of diagnosing and treating the disease in this group. Focusing on lowering cholesterol production or regulating lipid movement into the brain might be more effective, for example, than among whites, whose disease might rely on a different molecular pathway. And even if these interventions don't prevent the disease, they may help in slowing the onset of symptoms. This story was originally published on TIME.com.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have announced they are reducing their fuel surcharges as the price of oil has plummeted. Passengers on long-haul flights will enjoy the biggest reduction in fares. Both airlines said the cuts, effective Thursday, reflected the lower price of oil, and BA also credited its fuel hedging policy. It means BA passengers will pay £30-35 ($46-54) less on flights longer than nine hours, and £15-20 ($23-31) less on shorter flights, the airline said. European services will cost £4-5 ($6-7) less, BA said. Virgin Atlantic passengers will see similar reductions in the ticket price, the airline said. The fuel surcharge helped airlines pass the high cost of oil on to their passengers. As prices have dropped from a record high in the summer, airlines have been under pressure to cut the fee. This the second fuel surcharge reduction for BA. It first cut the charge in October.","BA, Virgin reduce fuel surcharges by as much as a third on long-haul flights .

"(CNN) -- As victims of a stabbing attack at Lone Star College near Houston recover physically and psychologically, the suspect in the incident waived his right to a court hearing Thursday, CNN affiliate KHOU said. Dylan Quick, 20, had been scheduled for a probable cause hearing, but he waived his right and did not appear in court, the station said. He remains in jail and under a suicide watch, his attorney said, according to KHOU. He is charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in Tuesday's attack, in which 14 people were wounded -- at least some of them with a utility knife. Two of the 14 people attacked remained hospitalized Wednesday, while others were out, dealing with the aftermath of the attack. ""I keep going over it. I see him coming at me,"" stabbing victim Andrea Cervantes told CNN affiliate KPRC. According to authorities, Quick attacked people on two floors of the school's health science center Tuesday. Witnesses to the stabbings described a chaotic scene as bleeding victims collapsed to the ground and students and teachers ran for cover. ""It just seemed like he was just going around, basically getting whoever was more open and easiest for him to reach,"" witness Cassie Foe told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday. The attacker was aiming at people's necks and faces, student Melody Vinton told KHOU. One woman had what appeared to be the blade of a box cutter sticking out of her cheek, she said. Witness Steven Maida said he and other students chased Quick down and pinned him to the ground until authorities arrived. After his arrest, Quick told police he had had fantasies of stabbing people since he was 8, Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia told reporters. He had been planning Tuesday's attacks ""for some time,"" Garcia said. A search warrant affidavit said that Quick told police that he also had fantasized about ""cutting off people's faces and wearing them as masks"" and about necrophilia and cannibalism. He also told police that he had researched mass stabbings, the affidavit said. Quick underwent a psychological evaluation Wednesday, according to the Harris County District Attorney's Office. Three people hurt in the stabbings were discharged from a Houston hospital Wednesday, while two others remained there in good condition, hospital spokeswoman Kathryn Klein said. The campus was shut down, and it reopened Wednesday, a day after the attack. Quick has intense ties to the school. Born deaf, he received a cochlear implant at age 7. The implant gave him the ability to hear, but he then had to learn how to speak. His mother home-schooled him and got him involved in Lone Star's library programs when he was a teen, according to CNN affiliate KPRC. A profile on a student blog recounts how joining a campus book club changed his life. He rarely spoke during his first two years in the library's teen activities program, according to the profile. ""But after those two years it was if a floodgate had opened up and Dylan became loquacious, sharing his analyses of literature and socializing with his book club comrades,"" the blog article says. ""His room at home, he explains, barely contains his 1,000+ collection of books. In the future he plans to build and host an online international book club to connect people of all ages from around the world,"" the profile says. The teen book club on campus encourages youths to enroll in the community college after high school graduation, and Quick did. Some faculty members said Quick was a good student there, Lone Star College-CyFair President Audre Levy told reporters Wednesday. Also, staff members at the county library branch on campus, where Quick worked part-time for about a year, ""had fond things to say of him,"" Levy said. ""So many are surprised"" that he was the suspect, she said. Quick was planning to finish his associate degree at the college and then transfer to the University of Houston to study accounting. Tuesday's incident came more than two months after three people were wounded in a shooting at a different Lone Star College campus -- the North Harris campus in Houston. CNN's Ed Lavandera, Joe Sutton, Jason Morris, Dave Alsup, Chandler Friedman, Paul Caron, Chuck Johnston, Ashley Fantz and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","NEW: Stabbing suspect Dylan Quick waives right to court appearance Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were former Navy SEAL commandos working as diplomatic security officers. Sean Smith was a computer expert with an online alter-ego legendary in the gaming world. The three men and U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens died in the assault on the American consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi. Details of how they met their fates in the Mediterranean city that had been the cradle of Libya's 2011 revolution were just beginning to emerge Thursday. On Thursday, a U.S. official confirmed Woods as among the dead. ""Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him 'Rone,' and they relied on his courage and skill, honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL,"" said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a statement. ""In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few months ago."" A diplomatic source told CNN that Doherty was in Libya to search for shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles -- a mission given high priority after the fall of longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi. Doherty grew up in Massachusetts with a passion for the outdoors, particularly the mountain West, his family said. Outside the family's home in Woburn, near Boston, his sister remembered him as ""our American hero."" ""Glen lived his life to the fullest,"" Katie Quigley told reporters. ""He was my brother, but if you ask his friends, he was their brother as well."" Arrest made in connection with deadly assault on U.S. consulate in Libya . The 42-year-old graduated from high school in 1988 in neighboring Winchester, where flags were displayed at half-staff on Thursday. He played on the varsity tennis and wrestling teams, school officials said in an announcement marking his death. His junior-year English teacher, Judy Hession, recalled him as ""bursting with life."" ""Every day his huge smile and his happy-go-lucky optimism filled my classroom,"" Hession said in a statement released by the school district. ""He got along with all types of people, was a class leader and, from the perspective of 30 years of teaching, one of my most memorable students."" After college in Arizona and stints as a ""ski bum"" and raft guide in Utah, Doherty joined the Navy and became a member of the elite Navy SEAL commandos in 1995, his family said in a statement. He had planned to leave the service after knee surgery in 2001, but after the al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, he ""was not allowed to to leave and didn't want to,"" his family said. Doherty served two tours of duty in Iraq, starting with the U.S. invasion in 2003, before leaving the military in 2005. He then became a private security contractor, working in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen -- a job that took a toll on his home life and contributed to a divorce, his family said. He also joined the advisory board of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, a group that has battled religious intolerance in the U.S. armed forces. Its president, former Air Force officer Michael ""Mikey"" Weinstein, said he was ""in a state of shock"" after learning of Doherty's death. 4 killed as Yemeni police, demonstrators clash at U.S. Embassy . ""He was one of our most active advisory board members,"" Weinstein said. ""I was surprised he was willing to come on and lend the gravitas that comes with being a Navy SEAL to our cause."" Doherty's involvement ""made it easier for others to come to us,"" Weinstein added. He said Doherty believed the kind of violent jihadists American troops faced were ""a very small percentage of the overall mosaic of the Muslim faith,"" and saw anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States and in the ranks as something that hurt U.S. national security. ""He went back to the Middle East because he cared deeply about the Muslim people, and because he cared about bringing freedom and democracy and human rights to the Middle East,"" Weinstein said. Doherty ""was a kind and caring person, and I'm sure that he gave every last bit of his courage and strength"" to defend the consulate and Stevens, he added. ""All this is going to do is light a further fire under us in Glen's name and memory to continue to fight for religious freedom and respect and tolerance."" He also co-authored a 2010 book, ""The 21st-Century Sniper: A Complete Practical Guide,"" with former comrade Brandon Webb. In a statement accompanying the family's, Webb said, ""Don't feel sorry for him, he wouldn't have it."" ""He died serving with men he respected, protecting the freedoms we enjoy as Americans and doing something he loved,"" Webb said. In her statement, Clinton said Doherty, a paramedic, was referred to as ""Bub"" by his friends and family. ""In the end, he died the way he lived -- with selfless honor and unstinting valor,"" she said. Smith's death was among the first reported in the Benghazi fracas. Clinton eulogized him Wednesday as a 10-year veteran of the Foreign Service, an information management officer who had served in Iraq, South Africa, Canada and the Netherlands. In real life, he was an Air Force veteran with a wife, a son and a daughter. But in the virtual universe of the computer game EVE Online, Smith was ""Vile Rat"" -- one of the leaders of a gamer's alliance renowned for his diplomatic skill in the multi-player space warfare simulation. Arabic press condemns violence, film-maker . ""If you play this stupid game, you may not realize it, but you play in a galaxy created in large part by Vile Rat's talent as a diplomat. No one focused as relentlessly on using diplomacy as a strategic tool as VR,"" Smith's friend Alex Gianturco wrote in a tribute posted on his website. Gianturco wrote that Smith had been under fire before, while posted to Baghdad. When that occurred, he usually broke off his messaging. ""We'd freak out and he'd come back OK after a bit,"" Gianturco wrote. But Tuesday night, after reporting ""GUNFIRE,"" Smith ""disconnected and never returned,"" he added. A few hours earlier, Smith had posted, ""assuming we don't die tonight. We saw one of our 'police' that guard the compound taking pictures,"" he recounted.

"(CNN) -- When Jason Njoku graduated from his UK-based university in 2005, he was filled with high hopes of entrepreneurial success. But after his business endeavors failed to take off for years, Njoku had no option but to move back to his mother's house in London. Returning home as a penniless 29-year-old was ""a harrowing experience"" but provided Njoku, a chemist by training, with his Eureka moment -- he realized there's a growing appetite for Nollywood films after noticing how his mother and other relatives had difficulties getting their hands on their beloved movies from Nigeria's booming film industry. The tech entrepreneur spotted the gap in the market and in 2010 he founded iROKO Partners, an internet company that distributes Nollywood films to viewers across the world. Described as the ""Netflix of Africa,"" Njoku's company has today grown to have more than 500,000 registered users. It has offices in London, New York and Lagos with some 100 staff and has secured $8 million in funding from U.S.-based hedge fund Tiger Global, early investors in Facebook. Earlier this week it launched a new internet subscription service which enables viewers to watch exclusive Nollywood films for $5 a month. CNN's Marketplace Africa spoke to Njoku about entrepreneurship in Africa, Nollywood and his plans for the future. CNN: Why did you decide to launch the subscription service? Jason Njoku: When we started the company, iROKO Partners, we were trying to solve the massive, I would say, dislocation in the popularity of Nollywood and the value it's created. A big part of what we did was actually focusing on cleaning up and organizing the content so we can provide a superior user experience, something which Nollywood lovers can really be proud of. Read more: Nigerian blockbusters for the internet generation . Having more than 500,000 registered users in a short space of time demonstrates that the appetite is there. People really love this content, which means it should be organized and given to them in the best format possible. We've spent a lot of money -- in the industry, licenses, organizing our team, we've got a staff of 100 people -- so our view is that some additional value needs to ... be given to this new subscription service we're rolling out, (called) iROKOtv+. CNN: Your company has been described as the Netflix of Africa. Do you want to be as big as Netflix? JN: At the moment we are focusing on the 30 million African diaspora. We've just reached 500,000 registered users, we think our additional market in the West is at least five to 10 million people, there are lots of Africans who love this stuff. I guess, ultimately, the big market is Nigeria...this is where the content originates from. If you spend any time in Nigeria, it is difficult to come across a person who hasn't heard of Nollywood. But at the same time, the pan-African nature of it -- from the Kenyans to the Ghanaians to Gambians to people in the DRC -- there's a massive base of people who really love this content. So because of the broadband restrictions in Africa, we are currently focused on the diaspora. CNN: Do you see the potential in the future to become as big as Netflix? JN: I think Netflix has 25 million subscribers across South America, U.S. Canada and the UK. We are really young, as ambitious as we want to be. Are there 25 million people who love this content? Most definitely there are 25 million people in Nigeria who love this content. Are they willing to pay for it? That's the big experiment we're kind of playing now. So we wouldn't want to compare ourselves to Netflix but we have an interest and opportunity to at least get somewhere along that line. CNN: Where are most of your viewers based? JN: Currently our biggest markets are the U.S., the UK, Canada, Italy and Germany. See also: African cinema at Cannes . CNN: What about Nigeria? JN: Nigeria has been growing -- I think it's in the top 10, but, again, just to put it in context, I believe we have more people watching just in London than we do have in the whole of Nigeria. CNN: Web connectivity and internet penetration are major issues in Africa. Have there been any improvements recently? JN: Eighteen months ago when I moved to Nigeria, broadband was really expensive and not that great. Now it's less expensive and it's much better. Internet adoption has definitely exploded in Nigeria and we feel it's better -- again, we're trying to serve very data-intensive, bandwidth hogging files, so we're always going to be slower on the uptake but it is improving. Read more: Web savvy Africans fuel online shopping . CNN: What prompted you to start the business? JN: I went to university to study chemistry with high hopes, my mum was really happy. I graduated in 2005 and then I started an entrepreneurial sort of trail. Whereas my friends went into banking, consulting, finance, I just wanted to be an entrepreneur, to work in projects which really interested me. Unfortunately, for five, almost six years I failed miserably at being an entrepreneur. So, in fact, literally what prompted the whole genesis of iROKO was at 29, almost 30 I had to move back with my mum. That was itself a harrowing experience but the interesting thing was that for the first time in eight years since I'd moved out I was actually able to see the viewing patterns of my mom change...She'd gone from watching western films to watching African films. Watch: Africa's internet awakening . Because I was able to observe her and we lived together then I could actually relate and she'd spend hours watching it. Then I had to drive her around to go and see my aunts and uncles who I hadn't seen in a long time -- it was exactly the same thing for these guys and I was like 'well, how can it be that so quickly so many people's viewing, video and entertainment habits change.' So it was really intriguing to find this stuff. Watch: Genevieve Nnaji: Nollywood's Julia Roberts . CNN: What has been the reaction from the Nigerian film industry? JN: The key thing is that we've invested more money in Nollywood in the shortest space of time -- far more than anybody else has done. We are remunerating movie producers who, quite rightly, are receiving additional revenue form their films as we have opened up a new funding avenue for them. Before, they were losing out to the pirates, now they are gaining financially from iROKOtv. Hopefully this new approach to monetizing Nollywood content will lead to producers re-investing in their films.","Jason Njoku is the founder and chief executive of iROKO Partners .

"(CNN) -- It's simple, President Obama said. Rape is a crime, and politicians -- especially male politicians -- shouldn't be ""making decisions about women's health care."" Appearing Wednesday on NBC's ""Tonight"" show, Obama responded to questions by host Jay Leno about a comment about rape by Indiana's GOP candidate for Senate, Richard Mourdock. Pregnancies occurring after a rape, Mourdock said, were intended by God. ""I don't know how these guys come up with these ideas,"" Obama told Leno. ""Let me make a very simple proposition: Rape is rape. It is a crime. And so these various distinctions about rape don't make too much sense to me -- don't make any sense to me."" Mourdock has apologized for offending anyone. But his words have fueled the national fight to gain women voters in a very close presidential election. Related: Women voters by the numbers . During his chat with Leno, Obama used the Mourdock controversy to say that the next president likely would appoint a new Supreme Court justice who could potentially change federal abortion laws. Obama on Mourdock: Male politicians shouldn't make abortion decisions . Obama's GOP presidential rival, Mitt Romney, has said he would appoint justices who would support overturning Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 court decision affirming a woman's right to have an abortion. ""Roe vs. Wade is probably hanging in the balance,"" Obama said. ""Women are capable of making these decisions in consultation with their partners, with their doctors,"" said the president. ""And for politicians to want to intrude in this stuff often times without any information is a huge problem."" The Obama campaign released a new television ad reinforcing those points, highlighting Romney comments on Roe vs. Wade and his plan to try and cut funding for Planned Parenthood. Related: When 'God's will,' rape and pregnancy collide . GOP distancing . Reaction within Mourdock's own party has been deafening. Romney had endorsed him in a TV ad before the controversy. Afterward, Romney said through a campaign spokeswoman that he did not agree with Mourdock's comments, but the ad would continue to run. Other powerful Republicans distancing themselves from Mourdock include 2008 GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain and Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a top GOP Senate fundraiser. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, canceled plans to campaign with Mourdock on Wednesday. And in a sharp rebuke, a fellow Republican running for Indiana's governor seat, former Rep. Mike Pence, issued a statement saying, ""I strongly disagree with the statement made by Richard Mourdock during last night's Senate debate. I urge him to apologize."" After apology, McCain does support Mourdock, spokesman clarifies . Mourdock said Wednesday he's sorry for any offense, but Democrats have twisted his comments for ""political gain."" The whole controversy, he said, exemplifies ""what's wrong with Washington these days."" ""I spoke from my heart; I spoke with my principle; I spoke from my faith,"" Mourdock said. A senior Republican strategist said Mourdock may not face as much push-back from GOP leaders for two reasons: Republicans very much want to hold on to that Indiana Senate seat. That -- with less than two weeks remaining before Election Day. What Mourdock said . Here are Mourdock's comments saying he supports banning abortions in cases of rape, word-for-word: . ""I struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize life is a gift from God, and I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen,"" said Mourdock, who now serves as Indiana's state treasurer. He also said he would allow for exceptions to an abortion ban when a mother's life was in danger. GOP Senate candidate: Pregnancies from rape God's will . On Wednesday, Mourdock tried to clarify his comments, saying, ""I absolutely abhor violence. I absolutely abhor any kind of sexual violence. I abhor rape, and I am absolutely confident that, as I stand here, the God that I worship abhors violence, abhors sexual violence and abhors rape. The God that I worship would never, ever want to see evil done."" Sounds familiar . It's not the first time rape and abortion have dominated the campaign. In August, Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri, who's also a Republican running for Senate, ignited a firestorm when he said ""legitimate rape"" rarely resulted in pregnancy. And last week, GOP Rep. Joe Walsh, who's running for re-election in Illinois, questioned the necessity of allowing abortions if a mother's life is at risk. He said such an exemption to an abortion ban was simply a political tool used by pro-choice activists. Doctors strongly disputed Rep. WalshÂ¹s contention that doctors rarely, if ever, perform abortions to save the life of the mother. McCain, R-Arizona, told CNN on Wednesday that his support for Mourdock was dependent on an apology. ""It depends on what he does,"" McCain said on ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Thursday, after hearing of Mourdock's apology, McCain said that he ""is glad"" Mourdock apologized and ""hopes the people of Indiana will elect Mr. Mourdock."" Former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum offered words of support for Mourdock Wednesday -- accusing opponents of ""gotcha politics."" Mourdock's comments resulted in a misunderstanding, Santorum told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" ""What the Senate candidate said is the child is a gift from God, whether it's conceived from rape or not, it's still -- the gift of human life is a gift from God,"" Santorum explained. ""He didn't say rape was a gift from God. You'd have to contort words beyond meaning to get that understanding of it."" Santorum: Mourdock criticism 'gotcha politics' It was ""gotcha politics,"" Santorum said, because Mourdock was ""talking about the baby in the womb as something that is precious,"" even though it was conceived through ""horrible circumstances."" The whole thing is ""outrageous"" and ""demeaning to women,"" said Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in a statement. Party leaders called on Romney to stop airing his TV ad endorsing Mourdock. ""As Mourdock's most prominent booster and star of Mourdock's current campaign ads, Mitt Romney should denounce these comments more strongly than he has,"" DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse said. ""He should go further and demand that the ad featuring him speaking directly to the camera on Mourdock's behalf be taken off the air, and Mitt Romney should withdraw his endorsement of Mourdock immediately."" CNN's Kevin Liptak and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.","President Barack Obama weighs in on comment by GOP Senate candidate .

"(CNN) -- President Obama has characterized his 2014 budget, released Wednesday, not as his ideal vision for how much the federal government ought to tax and spend, but rather as a compromise that aims to respect the priorities of Democrats and Republicans. He has insisted that congressional Republicans see the policy options laid out in his budget as a package deal, not as a menu of policy options from which to choose. And so the president's budget includes reductions in the planned growth of Social Security and Medicare spending, to appeal to conservative advocates of spending restraint, and a number of tax increases, the bulk of which are designed to affect high-earners, a high priority of the president's congressional allies. House Speaker John Boehner and other leading congressional Republicans have made their opposition to further tax increases clear. But President Obama's tax proposals nevertheless merit close attention, as they tell us a great deal about his priorities. One of the ways the Obama administration seeks to raise revenue is to have the federal government adopt chained CPI, a method of calculating consumer price inflation that factors in the fact that consumers tend to substitute some goods for others in response to rising or falling prices. Chained CPI has been discussed primarily with regards to its impact on federal outlays, and particularly Social Security spending, as it is expected to lead to somewhat lower cost-of-living adjustments that in turn will lead to somewhat lower Social Security benefit levels. Yet chained CPI will also lead tax brackets to be adjusted more slowly than they are under the federal government's current inflation index. This adjustment is expected to yield roughly $100 billion in new tax revenues over the next decade. In addition, the president has revived two proposals that figured prominently in his 2013 budget: the so-called ""Buffett Rule,"" which requires that households earning $1 million or more pay a minimum of 30% of their income in federal taxes, after allowing for charitable giving, and a limit on tax deductions for the highest-earning 2% of households. The Buffett Rule essentially raises taxes on millionaires who earn long-term capital gains, as Alan Viard of the conservative American Enterprise Institute has explained. The downside of the Buffett Rule, according to Viard, is that it might discourage capital investment and increase reliance on debt financing. The limit on tax deductions, meanwhile, reduces the value of itemized deductions to the 28% tax rate for households. That is, even as a household enters the 33, 35, and 39.6% tax brackets, the value of its itemized deductions will remain at the lower 28% rate. The president's budget also calls for substantial increases in federal taxes on tobacco products, which are designed to fund new preschool efforts. President Obama's tax proposals illustrate how difficult it will be to raise tax revenues by a substantial amount while shielding middle-income households from tax increases. Chained CPI and tax increases on tobacco products will almost certainly affect some number of households earning less than $250,000 a year, yet the Obama administration also intends to increase the size of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, which will tend to mitigate any harmful effect. Capping the value of itemized deductions will raise a substantial amount of revenue. But it won't do as much as more ambitious proposals to limit individual tax expenditures, like converting tax preferences tied to marginal tax rates to nonrefundable tax credits. This approach, however, also runs into political pitfalls, as it will raise taxes on at least some middle-income households, even as it reduces them for large numbers of low- and middle-income non-itemizers. If President Obama hopes to build momentum for a substantial revenue increase, he would be well advised to cheer on the efforts of Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, and Rep. Dave Camp, R-Michigan, the chairmen of the tax-writing committees of the Senate and House respectively, as both are working toward a larger, more ambitious tax overhaul. Though Camp and his Republican allies are resistant to tax increases, they might prove more amenable if comprehensive tax reform results in lower rates. Back in 2011, for example, the center-left Progressive Policy Institute released its ""Modified Zero Plan,"" which eliminated all tax expenditures but the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit and lowered rates to 12, 22, and 28%. Despite these substantially lower rates, revenues would increase, in part because capital income would be subject to the same tax rates as ordinary income. Of course, measures like the Buffett Rule would increase effective taxes on capital income even further. If Baucus and Camp converge around something like the Modified Zero Plan, the tax debate might finally break out of its current grim stalemate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Reihan Salam.","Reihan Salam: President is casting his budget as one with bipartisan appeal .

"(CNN) -- Twenty years ago, I was standing next to a teleprompter operator in the cavernous Cobo Hall in downtown Detroit. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton was addressing the Detroit Economic Club, and I was guiding the teleprompter operator through his prepared text. Drafted during an all-nighter -- one of many we'd pull during his campaign and presidency -- the speech presented his economic program in exhaustive detail. But, after ad-libbing lines from the beginning, Clinton extemporized an exhaustive explanation of German apprenticeship programs for skilled workers in manufacturing. By the time Clinton concluded his tutorial on job training programs, the teleprompter operator asked me where to start scrolling the remainder of the prepared text. ""Don't worry,"" I told him. ""Clinton will do just fine."" Analysis: Clinton speech hit Obama's marks . In his speech at the Democratic National Convention last night, Clinton still did just fine, just as he's done in so many speeches where he's treated his prepared text the way jazz greats soar from the sheet music. By one account, the former president spoke for 48 minutes and 5,895 words, while his prepared text, which had been distributed beforehand to the media, was only 3,136 words. No wonder, when asked about her husband's speech, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was looking forward to comparing the ""as prepared"" and ""as delivered"" texts. Reviewing each version, it's clear that the same person wrote both -- the same president who improvised 20% of his first State of the Union address and explained his health-care plan from memory to a joint session of Congress after the teleprompter displayed the text of an earlier speech. Clinton's improvisations are instructive because they show how the nation's most popular political figure (69% approval rating, according to a USA Today/Gallup poll) still serves as extemporizer-in-chief. While most speakers ad-lib anecdotes, Clinton also explains complex issues off-the-cuff. A sampler of Clinton's improvisations: . Zinger of the Week: When Clinton zapped Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan on Medicare spending reductions, ""It takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did,"" that line wasn't even in the prepared text. Bashing Brutus: In Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Mark Antony's funeral oration for the slain statesman skewers his rival by saying simply that Brutus is an ""honorable"" man. In improvised remarks, Clinton uses the same time-honored technique, describing the Republicans: ""They convinced me they were honorable people who believe what they've said, and they're going to keep every commitment they've made. We've just got to make sure the American people know what those commitments are."" Improvised Uplift: Clinton also effortlessly extemporized eloquent sayings that other public figures and their staffs might write and revise for several drafts: ""Democracy does not have to be a blood sport."" And ""So far, every single person who has bet against America has lost money."" Opinion: Bill Clinton brings it for Obama . Public Policy Professor: If you think the auto mileage standards are complex, listen up: ""No matter what the price [of gas] is, if you double the mileage of your car, your bill will be half of what it would have been."" Softening the Blow: Clinton's conversational tone makes it easier for him to persuade undecided voters. As did Ronald Reagan, Clinton introduced his arguments with folksy asides. Before criticizing today's Republicans, Clinton began by ad-libbing: ""Now, there's something I've noticed lately, You probably have, too."" Historian-in-Chief: Concluding his speech, Clinton reminded his audience that America -- and, by inference, its presidents -- have displayed remarkable resilience. Departing from his prepared text, Clinton added this anecdote about the first president: ""People have predicted our demise ever since George Washington was criticized for being a mediocre surveyor with a bad set of wooden, false teeth."" As president, Clinton would refer to most of his formal remarks not as speeches but as ""talks,"" subtly reminding his staff that he wanted to address Americans as adults to be persuaded, not an audience to be manipulated. By improvising so often, and using so few freeze-dried and focus-grouped applause lines, Clinton continues to keep his speeches fresh, friendly and factual in the hope that his listeners will open their minds to what he says. Yes, the Comeback Kid has made more farewell tours than Frank Sinatra. As with Old Blue Eyes, he does it his way. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of David Kusnet.","David Kusnet: Bill Clinton often speaks without relying on a teleprompter .

"(CNN) -- Tom Cruise should have been a rock star. Remember him pounding his air guitar in not much more than a shirt and shades in ""Risky Business""? He turned a pool hall into a concert stage, strutting his stuff in ""The Color of Money,"" shook his moneymaker under layers of latex at the end of ""Tropic Thunder"" and took a chance, singing in his own voice in ""Top Gun"" and ""Magnolia."" He always had the moves, and more important, he had the self-belief. He turns himself on. Still, the challenge of a full-blown musical has apparently not been something he's been in a hurry to tackle, perhaps wary of undercutting his action-man credentials. Turns out, some things are worth waiting for. Will audiences show up for 'Rock of Ages'? I don't know how much they may have finessed his vocal tracks, and it doesn't matter. He owns ""Rock of Ages,"" an addled tribute to '80s hair metal, from the very minute he appears. He emerges hazily from underneath layers of discarded groupies in a palatial hotel suite, sporting gunslinger body art and outrageous crotch jewelry, dispensing intensely eccentric, deeply fried philosophical nuggets before stumbling into the indoor Jacuzzi. Ladies and gents, meet Stacee Jaxx, God of Rock. A caricature of already larger-than-life personalities Axl Rose and Steven Tyler, Stacee is very much a supporting character in Chris D'Arienzo's Tony-award-winning 2009 musical. But he's also the star of the show, the one everybody else is dying to see, to make or to emulate. Cruise has the charisma to sell all that even as he shows us a boozed-up captive to celebrity, sex and ego. When he does perform, he's electric. However, Cruise is just as good in the dialogue scenes, whether it's messing with club owner Alec Baldwin's vulnerable brain or fending off an increasingly hot-under-the-collar ""Rolling Stone"" features writer (Malin Akerman). A karaoke musical in which almost everybody bursts into FM anthems at the drop of a hat (yes, even Baldwin, who duets with Russell Brand on a camp rendition of REO Speedwagon's ""Can't Fight This Feeling""), by rights ""Rock of Ages"" shouldn't come off as a one-man show. But it's an uneven fight, and you might find yourself itching for the fast-forward button whenever Cruise is off-screen. Julianne Hough, who portrayed Ariel in ""Footloose"" and who appeared in the strikingly similar ""Burlesque,"" plays the movie's ostensible heroine, Sherrie Christian, a small-town girl from Oklahoma who gets off the bus in Hollywood ready to pursue her dream of being a singer. Instead, she finds herself playing out a PG-13 version of ""Showgirls,"" waiting tables at the legendary rock club the Bourbon Room and falling in love with a co-worker, Drew (Diego Boneta). Drew's own singing aspirations get considerably more screen time than Sherrie's, but he still fails to make much impact. Hilariously, within hours of meeting her, he claims to have been inspired to write ""Don't Stop Believin."" ""It goes on and on,"" he explains modestly after giving her a taste of the first verse. You couldn't accuse the filmmakers of taking themselves -- or anything else -- too seriously. Director Adam Shankman, the veteran choreographer who also directed ""Hairspray"" (and a couple of episodes of ""Glee""), encourages the cast to amp everything up to 11, or in the case of Catherine Zeta-Jones, 111. She plays the mayor's wife, Patricia Whitmore, crusading to clean up the Strip and shut down the Bourbon Room for reasons more personal than political. All this sound and fury signifies next to nothing, and music fans may feel it's a funny sort of tribute that mocks as much as it rocks. Even so, it's good to see Tom Cruise letting his hair down. It's a fun show if you roll with it. 'Rock of Ages': 8 fun facts about the movie's costumes .","Tom Cruise stars in the musical film ""Rock of Ages""

"Istanbul (CNN) -- ""Hurry up,"" one of my rivals curtly warns me, as I clumsily try to decide which tile to add to my deck. Ali doesn't seem to realize that part of my dawdling is because I'm learning to play the Turkish game Okey for the very first time. Coached by my colleague, CNN producer Gul Tuysuz, I reach for a number. Then, in an effort to create some goodwill, I buy a glass of Turkish tea and send it over to Ali's side of the table. ""Thanks,"" he writes. But I still proceed to lose the game. Instead of playing Okey the traditional way, shuffling plastic numbered ties on a green-felt table in a smoky cafe, Gul and I are exploring the game digitally. This online version of Okey lets you win digital dollars and play with your friends via Facebook. It is definitely designed for a Turkish audience: Among the gifts you can send people are Turkish coffee, a nargila water pipe,and even a belly dancer. There is also a function called ""flÃ¶rt"" that lets you flirt with other players. It is a fairly simple formula that the game's online designers say has been wildly successful. Since Turkish start-up company Peak Games released Okey less than two years ago, the game has attracted more than 19 million users, with an average of more than 3 million players a month. ""We're only 2 years old,"" says Rina Onur, one of Peak Games' founders. The Harvard-educated former investment banker then rattles off accomplishments that would make any entrepreneur jealous. ""We started with three people, and now we're with 200. Five offices around the world, 10 million daily and 30 million monthly active users, to be the third-largest gaming company in the world."" An intense work force . Onur speaks in the company's offices, which overlook Istanbul's Bosphorus Strait. Ferry boats glide past the window, as employees stare intently at banks of computer monitors. The age of the work force here looks to be in the mid-20s, and the dress code is casual. But the atmosphere is pretty serious. I'm struck by how clearly I can hear the sound of clicking mouse buttons. It isn't easy to independently confirm some of Peak Games' claims. The young company does not reveal its revenues. As Rob Fahey, a British gaming industry consultant and columnist explains to me, there is a culture of secrecy within the online gaming industry. ""This is a very young market, and there are people who are treating it as a gold rush and there are others who are saying 'Listen, you have to build something sustainable,' "" Fahey says in a phone call from Britain. Regardless where Peak Games falls in this ongoing debate, it is clear that the Turkish start-up has quickly become a significant player in the online gaming industry. According to the application tracker AppData, Peak's 23 games have a total of more than 22 million monthly active users. That puts Peak Games within the world's Top 20 most popular application designers. Targeting an overlooked market . Part of Peak's successful strategy appears to be that it has focused on a region apparently overlooked by many of the world's more established game designers. ""We just saw there were huge opportunities around the Turkish and Arabic speaking market,"" explains Onur. ""We realized that there was so much demand, so much usage and Internet consumption, but not enough local content and local games."" With more than 31 million users, Turkey is the world's seventh-largest Facebook country, according to Socialbakers, another social media tracking company. Peak Games first targeted this enormous Turkish market by ""localizing"" games that had been designed for foreign audiences and converting some Turkish traditional games such as Okey to the digital realm. Statistically, Peak claims one in five Turkish Facebook users has now played Okey. Less than a year after its launch, Peak Games expanded its operations to the Arab world. The company established an office in Amman, Jordan, and this year acquired a Saudi Arabian online game designing company. Half of the company's millions of consumers now log on from the Arabic speaking world. Bridging a cultural divide . Fahey, who writes columns for Gamesindustry.biz, credits the ambitious Turkish start-up with getting a head start in Middle Eastern markets. ""The rest of the world doesn't really engage with these markets because it's hard. Selling games to American or British or German people is very easy, because it was figured out in the 1990s,"" Fahey says. ""If you've got a country that can organize a revolution over Twitter and one of the first things the government does when people get grumpy is it turns off the Internet,"" Fahey adds, referring to the 2011 revolution in Egypt, ""that should have been a wake-up call for business people."" Onur agrees it isn't always easy to translate games designed for American teenagers for an audience in, say, Saudi Arabia. ""The Arabic region and Arabic culture is even more difficult than Turkey to understand and penetrate, because of the cultural differences, religious differences, even the way that the alphabet works and the language works is different,"" she says. To avoid triggering religious taboos in Arab markets, for example, Peak Games had to transform a game character named Horus from an ancient Egyptian deity to a ""hero."" On the other hand, Peak Games has gambled that online gaming will likely grow in the Arab world, in part because it provides conservative Middle Eastern societies with an easy, alternative way to socialize. ""It's not as easy in a lot of these countries to go up to a bar or a cafe and meet someone and have a meaningful conversation,"" she says. ""These games provide a platform and a medium to talk to others without being shunned or looked down upon."" Barring linguistic divisions, the online gaming world effectively has no borders. As a result, designers at Peak's Istanbul offices have made some cultural observations, while monitoring game play of participants from different countries. In the hard-core, empire-building strategy game New Battles, for example, designer Balkan Cilingir said German players tended to focus on teamwork within their alliances, whereas Arab players were ""the most competitive"" and Turks were ""in the biggest rush to make the biggest army."" Peak is now in the process of designing a new strategy game, ""War of Mercenaries."" Its slightly cartoonish cast of warrior characters includes a Persian sapper, a Bedouin hunter, an Ottoman janissary and the legendary Ottoman aviator Hezarfen. Tailing James Bond: 007 locations .

"(CNN) -- The daughter of a West Virginia sheriff gunned down in his patrol car as he ate lunch told CNN on Saturday she believes there is a strong possibility he was targeted because of his crackdown on drug dealing in the area. Mingo County Sheriff Walter E. ""Eugene"" Crum had only taken office three months before he was shot to death on Wednesday, but already had built a reputation for targeting drug dealers and so-called ""pill mills."" ""My dad fought tirelessly against drug abuse. He just wanted to clean up the county and make it a better place to live,"" Crum's daughter, Julie Hall, told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield in her first television interview since her father was killed. ""Things are still under investigation at this time. We really are unsure,"" Hall said. She said her gut tells her ""it's a strong possibility"" his killing is linked to his law enforcement activities. Investigators have not publicly identified a possible motive in the case, but they have a suspect. Tennis Melvin Maynard, 37, is being treated at an area hospital after being shot by one of Crum's deputies, authorities said. A witness saw the shooting and called 911, giving police a license plate number and description of the car, the Mingo County sheriff's office has said. According to investigators, Maynard was spotted by deputies and led them on a high-speed chase before crashing his SUV. When he got out of his damaged vehicle, he pulled a gun, they said. Authorities have questioned Maynard twice, including shortly after he was shot. They will not disclose what he said the first time, and they said he was too medicated to give a lucid statement the second time, Williamson Police Chief Dave Rockel said. A search of Mingo County court records show no criminal arrests or civil cases involving Maynard. His only citation involves failure to wear a seat belt, according to the records. Maynard's mother, Olgie, told CNN her son spent time a state hospital for mental health issues in recent years. ""He went crazy,"" she said, explaining her son hadn't been the same since he was involved in a workplace explosion five or six years ago in Alabama. ""He was out in the yard yelling. We called the police, and they took him away."" Since then, she said Tennis had gotten more psychiatric help at another mental health center. At home in Ragland, where he lives with his parents, he mostly stayed in his bedroom and watched television. ""He talks a lot to himself,"" she said. ""... He was never violent."" The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has traced the gun authorities say was used in the shooting of Crum, according to West Virginia State Police. But police have refused to release the results of the trace at this time or say whether the gun was purchased by the suspect. Crum made a name for himself within West Virginia law enforcement circles for his Operation Zero Tolerance, the anti-drug enforcement policy that he put into place shortly after taking office in January. Crum's wife, Rosie, was appointed Thursday to finish the remainder of her husband's term, with an election set for 2014. ""She was the one who knew him best, and knew what he wanted to accomplish,"" Hall said. Hall said she and her brother were concerned for their mother's safety in the wake of the shooting, but believes she is the best person to carry on their father's legacy. ""No one can be 100% sure of what's going to happen,"" she said. Visitation was scheduled Saturday between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. at Mingo Central High School, according to the family. A service for Crum is planned for 1 p.m. ET Sunday at the high school. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Carol Cratty, Ross Levitt and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","FIRST ON CNN: Julie Hall says her father fought tirelessly against drug abuse .

"Albany, New York (CNN) -- An upstate school system apologized Friday after students got a writing assignment in which they were instructed to prove their loyalty to Nazi Germany by arguing Jews are ""evil"" and the source of that government's problems. Students in three Albany High School English classes received the assignment, which was due Wednesday. The assignment from the unidentified teacher was designed to flex students' ""persuasive writing"" skills. But Marguerite Vanden Wyngaard, superintendent of the City School District of Albany, called the assignment ""completely unacceptable."" ""It displayed a level of insensitivity that we absolutely will not tolerate in our school community,"" Wyngaard said, ""I am deeply apologetic to all of our students, all of our families and the entire community."" My Take: Nothing wrong with Nazi assignment . She told the Albany Times Union newspaper that one-third of the students refused to complete the work. The teacher has not been in school since the district learned of the assignment. The school district is considering disciplinary action, according to Ron Lesko, director of communications. Options include termination, but no decision has been made, Lesko said. In the assignment, students were to pretend the educator was a member of the Nazi government. ""You must argue that Jews are evil, and use solid rationale from government propaganda to convince me of your loyalty to the Third Reich!"" the teacher's assignment sheet said. The assignment reiterated, ""You do not have a choice in your position."" Wyngaard, according to the Times Union, said she did not believe the teacher acted with malice or ""intent to cause any insensitivities to our families of Jewish faith."" The assignment should have been worded differently, she said. Wyngaard said the district has been in conversations with the Anti-Defamation League about future training programs for students and staff. Earlier this year in New York City, a math homework assignment asked fourth grade students to tally the number of slaves on a ship, sparking outrage among parents and administrators.

"(CNN) -- A weekend rally by white supremacists in Memphis, Tennessee, saw far more cops than Klansmen on the streets. An estimated five dozen Ku Klux Klan members turned out in downtown Memphis to protest the City Council's decision to rename three parks now named for the Confederacy and two of its leaders, CNN affilliate WMC reported. Some of them wore the group's traditional white robes, while others were dressed in camouflage or black military-style fatigues as they took to the steps of the old Shelby County Courthouse on a rainy Saturday afternoon. They were surrounded by dozens more police officers and sheriff's deputies, most of them clad in riot gear, as they held the rally behind a protective fence. Outside, dozens more counterprotesters watched, many of them laughing and recording the Klansmen with mobile-phone cameras. ""I came here today because I want my kids to be able to see what ignorance looks like,"" one man told WMC. ""I want them to know what the past looks like and what the future shouldn't look like."" Community leaders in the city, where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, tried to draw attention away from the rally by inviting the public to a daylong ""Heart of Memphis"" festival ""as we celebrate a city of one Memphis, where together, we succeed."" ""We in Memphis and Shelby County and in this region took what could have been the worst of times and turned it into the best of times, in terms of showing that we can tolerate dissent even when the voices are voices that we're not pleased with,"" Memphis Mayor A.C. Wharton told reporters Saturday. The Memphis City Council voted in February to rename Confederate Park, Jefferson Davis Park and Nathan Bedford Forrest Park -- the latter two named for the president of the coalition of Southern states that tried to secede from the United States in 1861 and for the Confederate general who went on to become a Klan leader after the South lost the war. The measure drew complaints of revisionist history from some citizens but praise from others, WMC reported.","Klansmen protest a decision to rename Memphis, Tennessee, parks .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Draconian laws, brutal attacks against bloggers and politically motivated surveillance are among the biggest threats to Internet freedom emerging in the last two years, according to a new report from free speech advocates, Freedom House. ""Freedom on the Net 2012: A Global Assessment of Internet and Digital Media,"" looked at barriers to access, limits on content, and violations of user rights in 47 countries across the globe. Estonia was rated as having the greatest degree of Internet freedom, while Iran, Cuba and China were viewed as the most restrictive. While social media was key in the uprising in Egypt, censorship there continues apace, says Freedom House, a U.S.-based independent watchdog organization. Although online activism is increasing, the report said authoritarian regimes were employing a wider and increasingly sophisticated arsenal of countermeasures. Read more: The full report . According to Freedom House, China has the world's largest population of Internet users, yet the authorities operate the most sophisticated system of censorship. Its ""great firewall"" has become notorious for literally shutting down Internet ""chatter"" it views as sensitive. Earlier this year, censors blocked related search terms to prevent the public from obtaining news on prominent human rights activist Chen Guangcheng, who caused a diplomatic storm when he escaped house arrest to seek refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. Read more: News on blind activist's escape . Major web portals and social networking sites, though not state-owned, have had to comply with strict government censorship rules -- or risk being shut down. After launching a campaign to clean up ""rampant online rumors,"" Chinese authorities in March ordered the country's leading micro-blogging sites -- including Sina Weibo -- to disable their comment function for three days. In China, bloggers are also required to register their real names -- though it's not clear how many have complied with the rules. ""It's a typical response by officials and quite a successful strategy in making it extremely difficult to spread information beyond some small circles of activists,"" Jeremy Goldkorn, a leading commentator on China's social media, told CNN at the time. Freedom House claims Beijing's influence as an ""incubator for sophisticated restrictions"" has not gone unnoticed, with governments such as Belarus, Uzbekistan, and Iran using China as a model for their own Internet controls. Unrest across the Middle East prompted increased censorship, arrests, and violence against bloggers as authoritarian regimes look to quell calls for reform. Social media was widely accepted to have played a key role in popular uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia. Fearing a similar ""revolution"" in Saudi Arabia, the authorities there took immediate steps to respond to what they regarded as a national security threat. According to the Freedom House report, the Saudi government has issued warnings banning protests -- even using the BlackBerry multi-media message service (MMS) to discourage protesters from participating in demonstrations. They say the authorities have detained and intimidated hundreds of online political activists and online commentators, blocked and filtered sensitive political, religious or pornographic content from entering the Saudi Internet, and even recruited supporters online to campaign against calls for protests. Egypt's ""revolution,"" which ended the three-decade rule of Hosni Mubarak, was widely known as the Facebook or Twitter revolution because of the way activists used social media to spread their message, despite government countermeasures such as arresting dissidents, periodically blocking Internet access and restricting cellular networks. Read More: The faces of Egypt's 'Revolution 2.0' However, the reports says Mubarak-era censorship has continued in Egypt under the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), which took control until the election of Mohamed Morsy as president in June. Mobile phones, the Internet, and social media remained under vigorous surveillance, bandwidth speeds were throttled during specific events, while SCAF-affiliated commentators manipulated online discussions. According to Freedom House, activists and bloggers have been intimidated, beaten, or tried in military courts for ""insulting the military power"" or ""disturbing social peace."" After taking office in June, President Morsy pledged to work to free Egyptians subjected to unjust detention. That month, Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm reported that he had ordered the formation of a panel of Interior Ministry, Public Prosecution, and military judiciary officials to consider the cases of civilians detained by the military. But this week's report warns the future direction of Internet freedom in Egypt remains uncertain despite Morsy's election. Freedom House also highlighted countries seen as vulnerable to increased restrictions on freedom of speech. In Pakistan, the report noted that successive military and civilian governments have exerted greater control over Internet use, often citing national security or religious reasons for doing so. On several occasions the authorities have blocked access to services such as YouTube, Flickr, Facebook and various blogs -- often under pressure from religious groups. Another country on this watch list is Russia, where the report says Internet-inspired anti-government protests last year have prompted a desire on the part of the Kremlin to tighten up on its controls. ""The findings clearly show that threats to Internet freedom are becoming more diverse,"" said Sanja Kelly, project director for Freedom on the Net at Freedom House. ""As authoritarian rulers see that blocked websites and high-profile arrests draw local and international condemnation, they are turning to murkier -- but no less dangerous -- methods for controlling online conversations.""","Report looks at barriers to access, limits on content in 47 countries across the globe .

"(CNN) -- The man suspected of killing Colorado's prisons chief was still supposed to be behind bars. But because of a clerical error, Evan Ebel was let out of prison in January -- four years early. Authorities suspect he went on to kill Tom Clements, who led the state's prison system, last month. They have also said there is a ""strong connection"" between that killing and the murder of Nathan Leon, a pizza delivery driver who was found dead in suburban Golden, Colorado. ""The district has undertaken a review of its practices in an effort to avoid a reoccurrence of this circumstance,"" Charles Barton, chief judge of the 11th Judicial District, and Walter Blair, district administrator, said in a Monday statement. ""The court regrets this oversight and extends condolences to the families of Mr. Nathan Leon and Mr. Tom Clements."" Ebel went to prison in 2005. He was serving an eight-year sentence when he assaulted a prison guard. He entered into a written plea agreement, which stated Ebel would plead guilty to assault in the second degree and that the court would impose a consecutive sentence of up to four years plus a mandatory three years of parole. A sentencing hearing was held in June 2008. Records: Ebel told prison guard 'she would beg for her life' ""The judge announced a sentence of four years in the Department of Corrections but did not state it was consecutive because it was already required by the terms of the plea agreement,"" read Barton's and Blair's statement. ""Because the judge did not expressly state that the sentence was consecutive, the court judicial assistant did not include that term in the mittimus, the sentence order that went to the Department of Corrections."" Noted Denver-area attorney Scott Robinson represented Ebel in four cases from 2003 to 2005. They lost contact after that. ""If you were writing fiction, you might have trouble understanding this thing to be true. Catastrophic for three families -- the Clements, Leon and Ebel families,"" he said. ""What's really agonizing about this situation is it was an utterly routine plea bargain. A mundane task a judge undertakes every single day. Here we are five years later looking at the wreckage that was the result of those errors."" Clements was shot to death at his home outside Colorado Springs on March 19. Ebel was killed two days later in northern Texas in a gun battle with authorities that left a sheriff's deputy wounded.

"(CNN) -- Italy's president has pardoned a U.S. Air Force colonel convicted in absentia for his role in the seizing of a suspected terrorist in Italy in 2003. Nearly two dozen Americans, most thought to work for the CIA, were tried in 2009. The trial was the first in the world to deal with a practice that human rights groups call ""extraordinary rendition."" They say the United States has often transferred terrorism suspects to countries that practice torture. Washington has acknowledged making secret ""rendition"" transfers of terrorism suspects between countries but denies using torture or handing suspects over to countries that do. ""(Defense) Secretary (Chuck) Hagel welcomes the news of (Italian) President (Giorgio) Napolitano's decision to grant clemency to U.S. Air Force Col. Joseph Romano, and appreciates the Italian government's careful consideration of this matter,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said in a statement Saturday. The case centered on the extraordinary rendition of a Muslim cleric, Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr, or Abu Omar. He was seized on the streets of Milan in 2003, transferred to Egypt and tortured, he says. He was suspected of recruiting men to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan and was under heavy surveillance by Italy's intelligence agency. Prosecutors said he was nabbed by a CIA team working with Italian intelligence officials. Napolitano pardoned Romano to ""find a solution to an affair considered by the United States to be unprecedented"" and to solve ""a situation of great delicacy,"" Italian news agency ANSA reported, citing the president's office.","U.S. Air Force Col.

"(CNN) -- Health care was a huge topic during Wednesday's presidential debate. President Barack Obama said the repeal of Obamacare would cause seniors' prescription drug payments to rise. ""We were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600,"" Obama said during his debate with GOP challenger Mitt Romney. He went on to say that if Obamacare were repealed, ""those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care."" The facts: . Nearly 5.4 million Medicare recipients saved more than $4.1 billion on prescription drugs as a result of the Affordable Care Act, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in an August news release. ""Seniors in the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap known as the 'donut hole' have saved an average of $768,"" she said. The law helps make Medicare prescription drug coverage more affordable. Complete coverage of CNN's Fact Checks . People with Medicare can pay a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. In 2010, enrollees paid 100% of their drug costs up to $310. For costs above that figure, they paid 25% of the total until that total reached $2,800. Once that figure had been reached, beneficiaries were responsible for the full cost of their drugs until they had spent $4,550 -- after which, their share usually dropped to 5%. That coverage gap is referred to as the ""donut hole."" The Affordable Care Act changed the formula. In 2010, Medicare recipients who hit the prescription drug donut hole received a $250 rebate. Last year, people with Medicare who reached the donut hole got a 50 percent discount on covered brand-name drugs and a discount on generic drugs. Recipients will pay less and less until 2020, when they will be responsible for only 25% of the cost of their drugs until they reach the yearly out-of-pocket spending limit, according to a 2010 posting on healthcare.gov by Jonathan Blum, director for the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services. Conclusion: Seniors, on average, would pay the $600 cited by Obama -- and then some, according to Medicare figures, if the Affordable Care Act was not in place. Fact Check: Job creation .

"(CNN) -- New York's attorney general wrote NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Thursday, urging him to firmly state that potential players won't be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation. The letter from Eric Schneiderman comes after a few prospective players said that during last month's scouting combine in Indianapolis, one or more NFL teams asked them questions about their relationships with women. The remarks spurred a debate over whether NFL clubs were inquiring into players' sexual preferences and whether gay people would be discriminated against by the 32 teams. ""Equal protection under the law is an essential issue for employers, employees and prospective job applicants,"" Schneiderman wrote to Goodell. ""For that reason, I ask that the league clarify its position by issuing a public statement that any form of discrimination or harassment on the basis of sexual orientation by league teams or their employees or agents against potential recruits or players constitutes a violation of state, local and, in some cases, contractual law, and will not be tolerated."" NFL to investigate whether Nick Kasa was asked about sexual orientation . In February, Nick Kasa, who played tight end at the University of Colorado, told CNN that during the combine he was asked: ""Do you have a girlfriend? Are you married? Do you like girls?"" ""Those kind of things, and it was kind of weird,"" he told CNN. ""But like they would ask you with a straight face, and it's a pretty weird experience altogether."" Kasa did not say who asked him those questions. University of Michigan quarterback Denard Robinson told a sports radio talk show that he was asked whether he had a girlfriend. The NFL said in February that it would investigate the allegations and said it already had policies against such questions in place. ""Any team or employee that inquires about impermissible subjects or makes an employment decision based on such factors is subject to league discipline,"" NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said at the time. League policy states that teams ""neither consider nor inquire about sexual orientation in the hiring process,"" Aiello said then. ""In addition, there are specific protections in our collective bargaining agreement with the players that prohibit discrimination against any player, including on the basis of sexual orientation."" On Thursday, Aiello reiterated the league's position that all teams must follow federal and state employments laws. The combine is a skills audition for NFL general managers and coaches to evaluate players before the draft, which this year will be held April 25 to 27. The National Football League is based in New York.","New York's attorney general asks NFL to explicitly state it won't tolerate sexual orientation bias .

"(CNN) -- A former African naval chief appeared in a New York City court Friday accused of being a drug kingpin involved in smuggling cocaine from Latin American paramilitaries into the United States. Rear Adm. Jose Americo Bubo Na Tchuto, once head of Guinea Bissau's navy, was seized on a boat on the Atlantic Ocean by officials from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. Four other Guinea-Bissau citizens -- Manuel Mamadi Mane, Saliu Sisse, Papis Djeme and Tchamy Yala -- have also been detained. Two more men, Rafael Antonio Garavito-Garcia and Gustavo Perez-Garcia, both Colombian, were arrested in a related operation Friday in Colombia. They remain there pending extradition to the United States. The five African men appeared in a U.S. Magistrate Court in New York Friday. DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said the arrests were ""significant victories"" against terrorism and international drug trafficking. ""Alleged narco-terrorists such as these, who traffic drugs in West Africa and elsewhere, are some of the world's most violent and brutal criminals,"" she said in a DEA statement. ""They have no respect for borders, and no regard for either the rule of law or who they harm as a result of their criminal endeavors."" According to the DEA, Na Tchuto, Djeme and Yala all face charges of conspiracy to import narcotics into the United States. If found guilty, they could face life in prison. Na Tchuto was designated a drug kingpin by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2010, at which point he was chief of staff of Guinea-Bissau's navy. He was subsequently arrested over his alleged involvement in an attempted coup in 2011 and then freed after another coup in 2012. The two Colombians, along with Mane and Sisse, were charged with conspiring to engage in narco-terrorism; conspiring to import narcotics into the United States; and conspiring to provide aid to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, as the guerrilla group is commonly known, by storing FARC-owned cocaine in West Africa. Mane, Sisse and Garavito-Garcia were also charged with conspiring to sell weapons, including surface-to-air missiles, to be used to protect FARC cocaine processing operations in Colombia against U.S. military forces. The arrests were the culmination of a long-standing undercover operation in Guinea-Bissau and elsewhere, the DEA said. Na Tchuto, Djeme and Yala were detained Tuesday in international waters near Cape Verde, off the West African coast, the DEA said, while Mane and Sisse were arrested in a West African nation two days later and handed over to U.S. authorities. They were then flown to the United States. Guinea-Bissau, a small coastal nation of about 1.6 million people sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea, has been wracked by successive coups and attempted coups since it gained independence from Portugal in 1974. The current transitional government took over after the last military-backed coup in April 2012. A U.S. Justice Department report in 2011 highlighted West Africa's growing role in the international drugs trade -- and put Guinea-Bissau at the center of that illegal activity. ""Due to its lack of law enforcement capabilities, its susceptibility to corruption, its porous borders, and its strategic location, Guinea-Bissau remains a significant hub of narcotics trafficking on the verge of developing into a narco-state,"" the report said. ""While many officials within the Government of Guinea-Bissau recognize the extent of the drug problem and express a willingness to address it, a crippling lack of resources and capacity remains a hindrance to real progress in combating drug trafficking."" The report pointed to Na Tchuto's then-position as navy chief as ""likely to further entrench drug cartels in the permissive operating conditions prevailing in Guinea-Bissau."" According to the indictment unsealed Friday in New York, Mane, Sisse, Garavito-Garcia and Perez-Garcia ""agreed to receive and store multi-ton shipments of FARC-owned cocaine in Guinea-Bissau"" where it would be held before being shipped to the United States. Once there, it would be sold for the FARC's gain. The defendants also agreed that ""a portion of the cocaine would be used to pay Guinea-Bissau government officials for providing safe passage for the cocaine through Guinea-Bissau."" Na Tchuto, in discussions with undercover DEA sources, allegedly noted that it would be a good time to carry out the plan because the Guinea Bissau government was weak after the recent coup. He allegedly offered to use a company he owned to help with the plan and said his fee would be $1 million per 1,000 kilograms of cocaine received in Guinea Bissau, the indictment said. The FARC, designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, and the Colombian government have been at war since the 1960s. Though it began as an insurgency and continues to champion leftist causes, the FARC is sometimes criticized for eschewing its beliefs in favor of running drugs. Colombia is one of the world's top cocaine producers, and the FARC is thought to make hundreds of millions of dollars from the illicit trade each year. The five African suspects are due back in court later this month.","Ex-Guinea-Bissau navy chief Jose Americo Bubo Na Tchuto is accused of smuggling cocaine .

"(CNN) -- A year ago at this time, U.S. gasoline prices averaged $3.97 a gallon. It was the highest average in all of 2012. But it's a much different story this year, as prices continue to fall. The average per-gallon cost in the continental United States is now $3.65, 32 cents less than last year's peak, according to Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Survey. That's a 6-cent decrease from two weeks ago and a 15-cent decrease from six weeks ago. Lundberg attributes most of the latest drop to lower crude oil prices, but she also credits a more plentiful supply. ""More U.S. refineries are gaining access to lower-priced domestic and Canadian oils and passing these benefits on to their marketers and retailers in the form of slashed wholesale gasoline prices,"" Lundberg said. Lundberg expects the national per-gallon average to fall a few more cents this week as long as the price of crude doesn't jump. The Lundberg Survey canvasses about 2,500 filling stations every two weeks. In the latest survey, the cheapest gas was $3.33 a gallon in Billings, Montana. The highest was $4.05 in Chicago. Average per-gallon prices in other cities: . Charleston, South Carolina: $3.41 . Atlanta: $3.50 . Denver: $3.57 . Minneapolis: $3.63 . Las Vegas: $3.67 . Boston: $3.69 . Sacramento, California: $3.86 .","Cheaper crude oil prices, more plentiful supply keeps gas prices falling in the United States .

"(CNN) -- The commander of the NATO-led forces in Afghanistan has taken exception to President Hamid Karzai's contention that the United States and the Taliban were holding daily talks, and that the militant group prefers that foreign troops remain in the country. ""We have fought too hard over the past 12 years. We have shed too much blood over the past 12 years. We have done too much to help the Afghan Security Forces grow over the last 12 years to ever think that violence or instability would be to our advantage,"" said Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the commander of the International Security Assistance Force. On Sunday, after a weekend bombing in Kabul that killed at least nine people, Karzai said there are ""ongoing daily talks between Taliban, American and foreigners in Europe and in the Gulf states."" Saturday's attack, Karzai said, shows ""that Taliban want longer presence of foreigners -- not their departure from Afghanistan."" 'No reason to support instability' Dunford took exception to that characterization. ""President Karzai has never said to me that the United States was colluding with the Taliban. All I can do is speak for the coalition to tell you that it's categorically false, and that we have no reason to be colluding with the Taliban,"" he said. ""We have no reason to be supporting instability in Afghanistan. And all that we have been about over the past 12 years is to bring peace and stability to the Afghan people so that they can take advantage of the decade of opportunity that will follow 2014."" The United States plans to wind up its 11-year combat mission in Afghanistan by the end of next year. Dinner to smooth things over . On Sunday, several hours after Karzai made his remarks, he met with U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel over dinner in the Afghan capital. The meeting was an attempt to smooth over the latest dispute in the already strained relationship between the two allies. Hagel told reporters he tried to reassure Karzai that the United States had no unilateral back-channel talks with the Taliban. ""The fact is, any prospect for peace or political settlements -- that has to be led by the Afghans. That has to come from the Afghan side,"" Hagel said. ""Obviously, the United States will support efforts if they are led by the Afghans to come to some possible resolution."" Hagel, a former senator who took the helm at the Pentagon last month, made his first trip to Afghanistan as defense secretary. Karzai, meanwhile, has been increasingly critical of American forces in recent months. While there have been reconciliation talks in the past, the United States has not said any such talks are currently underway with the Taliban. In January, a U.S. official said reconciliation talks were showing ""some signs of life"" after being dormant for a year. News conference canceled . Hagel's dinner with the Afghan leader in Kabul came after a scheduled joint news conference between the two was canceled. Pentagon spokesman George Little said the schedule had changed ""for a variety of reasons, to include decisions related to security in Kabul that were reached in consultation with our Afghan partners."" ""I know these are difficult issues for President Karzai and the Afghan people,"" Hagel said after the meeting. ""I was once a politician, so I can understand the kind of pressures that especially leaders of countries are always under. I would hope, again, that we can move forward, and I have confidence that we can and will deal with these issues."" Taliban: Attack a message to Hagel . The Taliban claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack at the Afghan defense ministry in Kabul, which killed at least nine people and wounded 14 others. A Taliban spokesman expressed pleasure with Hagel's proximity at the time, calling the attack ""a message to him."" ISAF rejected suggestions that the Taliban even knew of Hagel's trip when they planned the operation. Tensions ahead of pullout . Afghanistan's National Security Council, chaired by Karzai, recently accused ""armed individuals named as U.S. special force"" of torturing and murdering innocent people in Wardak province. The government demanded members of the elite U.S. military units leave the province west of Kabul. But the council also said the United States rejected such suggestions. U.S. military officials said all allegations of misconduct are taken seriously, and that the military was looking into the allegation. Last year, Karzai called for U.S. troops to pull out of outposts in Afghan villages and return to their main bases. In October, he complained the United States was failing to supply Afghan forces with weapons needed to fight insurgents. Then-U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta responded at the time that ""it would be helpful if (Karzai), every once in a while, expressed his thanks for the sacrifices that have been made by those who have fought and died for Afghanistan, rather than criticizing them."" The Obama administration is making decisions about bringing troops home. In January, Panetta reiterated his opposition to pulling out all U.S. troops by 2014, saying it would take away negotiating leverage with the Taliban. ""The stronger position we take about staying, the better chances we have to ultimately reach political reconciliation,"" Panetta told journalists.","""We have fought too hard over the past 12 years,"" Dunford says .

"(CNN) -- My cousin Aaron abruptly typed me the news while we were texting back and forth about other matters: a Kansas City Chiefs football player killed his girlfriend, then went to the team's practice facility and committed suicide in front of his head coach and general manager. Left behind was the couple's 3-month-old daughter, who was in another room when her mother was shot multiple times. Like so many Americans, we were stunned. We would learn later that player was Jovan Belcher, 25-year-old starting linebacker for the Chiefs, a man and an athlete spoken of in the highest regard by everyone from his high school teammates and coaches to his fellow professional football players. They, too, were stunned. Indeed, what would lead a man who, by all accounts, loved family, friends and football and had overcome great odds to make the National Football League as an undrafted pick out of the University of Maine to take such shocking actions? A man raised by a single mother, he had achieved so much in such a short period that he had widely been considered a great role model for what could be done through hard work, grit and determination. A gun control halftime show: Should Bob Costas have spoken out on Belcher suicide? Since the killing and suicide are so fresh, so recent, we do not really know what might have driven Belcher to such extreme and horrific actions. But the knee-jerk reactions have been rampant on the social networks. ""Coward"" is a term being used to describe Belcher. But that is too easy, far too simplistic, and name-calling never solves a problem. Belcher was a man living in the supersized macho world of football, a world in which many of us American males reside, be it football or not. Too many of us have been taught manhood in a way that is not healthy. Be tough, men do not cry, man up -- these are the things I've heard my entire life, and I now cringe when I hear this relayed to boys or younger men by teachers, coaches, fathers, mentors and leaders. Or we use derogatory and sexist or homophobic words to describe men or boys who do not meet the ""normal"" of what a male is supposed to be. Some of these male authority figures mean well, or are simply repeating what they were socialized to be or to do, and do not realize that they are unwittingly teaching that manhood has little room to express hurt, disappointment and sorrow. Yes, they had been arguing, Belcher and his girlfriend, but in my work as an activist, including around gender violence prevention, I've seen the tragic pattern across our nation of men who, in the heat of rage, have killed their girlfriends, wives or lovers, as if they had no other vocabulary or emotion to deal with the disagreement or the break-up. We cannot forget Kasandra Perkins in this story. Because when men behave in this manner, it also says, bluntly, that the life of a woman is of no value whatsoever. Just the fact that much of the media has focused on Belcher and barely mentions Perkins by name speaks to this truth. In the late 1990s, after achieving some level of success from my years on MTV's ""The Real World"" and as a feature writer for Quincy Jones' Vibe magazine, I descended into a dark period that included excessive drinking, painful bouts with anxiety, stress and depression, and, yes, I thought often of committing suicide. I had been fired from Vibe. I had a terrible time coping with life back then, and I kept much of it to myself because we live in a world where men are not encouraged to express the hurts we feel. News: NFL Chiefs play after murder-suicide . That is the problem for so many of us. We do not talk about much of anything, except sports, women and sex. Everything else is routinely ignored. Or repressed. Until we explode. What eventually helped me get through those dark years, years that too were riddled with violence -- toward myself, toward others -- in various forms, was a renewed commitment to my spiritual foundation, a return to therapy in a very serious and consistent way, and surrounding myself with people, including men, who were willing and able to give me the safe space to talk about anything and everything. For the past several years, I have privately advised and counseled several professional and amateur athletes, and entertainers, all men, all grappling with very warped definitions of manhood. The recurring theme over and over is fear of expressing themselves fully, fear of letting others down, fear of not being the tough and rugged men they were told they had to be. And on the inside so many of them are damaged as a result. The very definition of manhood they've embraced is more an emotional prison than anything else. This is probably why the one scene that is locked in for me is of Belcher thanking his coach and general manager for what they did for him. Then walking away and shooting himself in the head. We must struggle, harder than ever, as men, as boys, as a nation, to reach the point where a heart-to-heart conversation is the first and only option, not a gun, not gun violence. The lives of Jovan Belcher and Kasandra Perkins will have been in vain completely if we do not go deeper within ourselves to teach and show our sons, our husbands, our boyfriends, our fathers, our men and boys, that there is another way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kevin Powell.","Jovan Belcher killed his girlfriend, then shot himself in front of team's staff, police say .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Gabby Giffords will never be the same after being shot through the head little more than two years ago. Yet one thing hasn't changed, ironically, is her appreciation for guns. For the former congresswoman who is now at the center of the debate over gun control and background checks, target practice is still a form of entertainment. In the back yard of her mother Gloria's house, located deep in the Arizona desert, Giffords' husband, Mark Kelly, uses planting pots and water bottles as targets. Giffords watches from the patio above with her mother, cheering him on. ""Excellent!"" exclaims Giffords. ""Excellent!"" repeats her mother. And Kelly isn't shooting with just any kind of gun. It's a 9mm Glock, the same kind Jared Loughner used to shoot Giffords while she greeted constituents in front of an Arizona supermarket. ""In that case it had a magazine that held 33 rounds,"" said Kelly. ""He shot 33 rounds. Every round hit somebody, we think."" This gun belongs to Giffords. It was a gift from her husband several years ago, before she was shot. ""Well, Gabby used to like shooting a gun, too,"" Kelly said when asked how recreation for him can still be shooting a gun after his wife was shot though the head. ""Yes,"" Giffords adds. ""She didn't want to get rid of it,"" said Kelly. Gabby and Mark: The new 'Bradys' of gun control . Nevertheless, allowing CNN's cameras to exclusively capture Kelly shooting a gun with Giffords looking on is meant to help advance their political cause: curbing gun violence. They hope to show that Giffords and Kelly are legitimate gun owners and credible messengers for tightening gun restrictions. The speed of background checks . Kelly also showed off a gun he recently bought -- videotaping the transaction -- for the sole purpose of demonstrating how easy it is to get a background check, and why he and Giffords want the checks expanded to private sales such as gun shows. ""When we timed it, it took 5 minutes and 36 seconds, not a lot of time. You could do the same thing at the gun show where people are currently not subject to background checks in most states,"" said Kelly. 'Stronger, better, tougher': Giffords improves, but she'll never be the same . Giffords and Kelly formed their organization -- Americans for Responsible Solutions -- in January, the second anniversary of the shooting that left Giffords partially paralyzed and robbed the once-articulate politician of her gift of speech. ""Optimistic!"" Giffords exclaimed. One word. But a clear answer she gave to describe how she sees the odds for gun restrictions to pass. ""I am, too,"" said Kelly. ""Especially when we're talking about universal background checks."" Sandy Hook . The Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting in Connecticut last December spurred them to take a stand. She paused. The brain damage from her own gunshot wound makes it difficult for her to find words, even ""Sandy Hook."" ""Sandy Brook,"" said Giffords several times, before finally getting the word right by repeating her husband. ""Sandy Hook,"" said Kelly. ""Hook,"" Giffords finally said. ""Sandy Hook Elementary. You know, it's something we just can't -- you know, 20 -- 20 first graders,"" Kelly said, as Giffords chimed in. ""First graders died ... awful."" Being politically realistic . Following recent mass shootings, the couple originally called for a ban on assault weapons and limits to high-capacity magazines. This year, Giffords made a dramatic plea to senators, asking them to be ""bold"" and ""courageous."" But the couple admits there are limits on what is politically realistic. ""Background checks,"" said Giffords, when asked to name the single most important move Congress could make right now. Reid to force a vote Thursday on debating gun proposals . Giffords has learned to navigate an iPad for e-mail with her left hand, because her right hand is paralyzed. But most of her communicating with former colleagues -- pressing them for new gun laws -- goes through Kelly, and most of it is on the phone from their home in Arizona. Kelly notes that when they visited congressional offices in February, she didn't have to say much to make her point. ""When Gabby sits in their office and tells them how important a universal background check bill is, they -- they hear that. And she's a former colleague. She was doing her job, you know, like they do every single day, when she was nearly killed,"" said Kelly. Representing a 'red' district . When Giffords was in Congress -- she represented her largely Republican Arizona district on the Mexican border -- filled with voters who expected her to defend their gun rights. She pushed to overturn a gun ban in the District of Columbia, and voted to allow guns in national parks. Exclusive: Gabby Giffords still appreciates gun culture . A conservative Democrat herself, she knows first-hand how politically hard it is for her former colleagues to support gun restrictions. ""Yes, it's tough,"" said Giffords. A big part of what Americans for Responsible Solutions is trying to do is raise enough money and gain enough influence to be a counterweight to the powerful NRA. When they press senators to support background checks, they tell them they will spend money in their states to back them up and support them. They said their money -- their organization is a super PAC that can raise unlimited funds -- is coming both from small donors on the Internet and large wealthy donors who are writing big checks. Stopping 'a bad guy with a gun' What does Giffords think of the National Rifle Association's argument that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun? ""It doesn't work. It doesn't work!"" she exclaimed. But, realistically, had she not been shot, would the pro-gun congresswoman have been open to voting for stricter gun laws? ""Yes. Yes,"" Giffords said. Biden: Gun vote opponents in a 'time warp' She tried to describe her politics when in Congress. ""Middle of the road,"" she said. ""Straight in the middle."" There is no question the gun culture is deeply ingrained in Giffords. She still exposes herself to guns, even after her near fatal shooting. What is it like to hear gunshots go off? Does it startle her? ""No. No,"" said Giffords. ""I think that's because Gabby doesn't remember the gunshot going off the day she was injured, right? You don't remember that?"" Kelly asked Giffords. ""No,"" Giffords affirmed. Since Giffords is right-handed, and that hand is paralyzed, she is limited in what she can do with her left hand. That has made joining her husband in target practice impossible. Would she want to shoot a gun again? ""We've talked about it. Gabby has actually held it. (She) hasn't shot one since she's been injured, but, a few days ago, she was actually trying to aim with it, with her left hand,"" said Kelly. Does she want to work towards being able to shoot? Is it a priority? ""Not really,"" said Giffords. ""Not at the top of the list."" added Kelly. Giffords is seen as a good spokesperson for new laws to curb gun violence, even though she can't speak very well. ""It stinks,"" Giffords responds. Again, two words which speak volumes.

"(CNN) -- Despite a recall, millions of people may continue taking a generic form of Lipitor that might contain specks of glass. Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals issued the recall at the retail level November 9, directing pharmacies not to dispense contaminated lots of the drug, but gave no directions to patients who have the drug at home. It's made for a confusing situation for patients taking Ranbaxy's atorvastatin, the generic form of Lipitor. Cholesterol drug recalled over glass concerns . ""Patients are sandwiched between two groups who are being less than helpful: the FDA and Ranbaxy,"" said Lisa Gill, editor of prescription drugs at Consumer Reports. A Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman couldn't explain why the recall didn't direct consumers to stop taking the drug even though patients might have received the contaminated pills. The spokeswoman, Sarah Clark-Lynn, referred questions about the recall to Ranbaxy, which issued a one-paragraph statement on its website and did not return phone calls and e-mails from CNN. The statement said that ""select batches"" of the medicine may contain ""small glass particles approximately less than 1mm in size"" and that the recall was being conducted ""out of an abundance of caution."" It did not give consumers guidance about what to do with supplies of the drug at home. ""In my recent memory, there has never been anything like this,"" Gill said. ""It makes my palms sweat just thinking about it."" Advice to patients . Between 3 million and 4 million people take Ranbaxy's atorvastatin, according to Ross Muken, senior managing director at ISI Group. The company has over a 40% share of the generic Lipitor market. One major pharmacy, Express Scripts, is telling patients it will not exchange Ranbaxy atorvastatin for another brand, according to Brian Henry, vice president of corporate communications for Express Scripts. ""Ranbaxy, in conjunction with the FDA, has determined there are no safety concerns associated with continued use of atorvastatin in the patients' possession,"" a recorded message tells consumers who call Express Scripts. Pharmacists at several CVS pharmacies said it was all right to keep taking already-filled prescriptions of Ranbaxy atorvastatin, but the company would exchange it for another brand at a customer's request. Consumer Reports is advising consumers to take potentially contaminated medicine back to the pharmacy and request another brand, Gill said. A company with a history . Ranbaxy, India's largest pharmaceutical company and the 12th largest generics maker in the world, has had quality problems in the past. The FDA has accused the company of ""a pattern of systemic fraudulent conduct,"" including taking shortcuts in crucial quality tests. So widespread and grave was the misbehavior that in 2008 the FDA barred Ranbaxy from importing 30 drugs into the United States.

"Washington (CNN) -- The FBI and the Secret Service are investigating another incident involving a website that has divulged purported personal information about senior U.S. government officials and celebrities. This time it is the new Secret Service director. A website posted information allegedly about Julia Pierson, who was named in March to head the agency charged with protecting the president and other top-level government officials. The Secret Service would not comment beyond acknowledging it is looking into the matter. The FBI would not say whether the information on the Internet, including Social Security and financial data, was accurate nor would they say whether investigators believe those materials were obtained by hacking. As with some past reports on other people, it appeared that some of the information for Pierson is dated. For instance, it lists a Florida address although she has lived and worked in the Washington area for years. Other information allegedly linked to the Secret Service director included a credit report, bank and mortgage information, and retail credit cards, including Macy's, Sears and Home Depot. The website, which CNN is not naming, has posted materials in the past claiming to belong to an assortment of public figures.

"(CNN) -- As Minnesota gears up for its first wolf hunt, advocates of the once-endangered gray wolf are hoping the court will intervene. Last week, the Center for Biological Diversity, a national conservation organization, joined the Minnesota group Howling for Wolves in asking the state's Supreme Court to stop wolf hunting and trapping this fall. The state's first regulated wolf season is expected to start Saturday, November 3. The Minnesota Court of Appeals denied the groups' motion for a preliminary injunction earlier this month because the groups failed to ""demonstrate the existence of irreparable harm to the wolves,"" and consequently, they are asking the state's Supreme Court to review the decision. ""Rushing to open a hunt this fall, the Department (of Natural Resources) slammed the door on meaningful public participation in a controversial management decision about wolf hunting and trapping,"" Collette Adkins Giese, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. ""Only by stopping the hunt can we ensure that these state officials follow the law and do their duty to protect our state's wildlife."" In a separate legal issue, the Humane Society and The Fund for Animals filed notice of their intent to sue the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to restore federal protections for Great Lakes wolves under the Endangered Species Act. The groups also asked Minnesota to postpone wolf hunting until the case is decided. ""This is a hunting season, pure and simple. It is recreational killing,"" said Howard Goldman, the Minnesota state director of The Humane Society. ""Wolves are highly intelligent, complex animals that play a very important role in our natural ecosystem. They are not stalks of corn; they aren't something you could harvest. People care deeply about wolves in the state, and they don't want wolves to be taken for sport or recreation."" In Minnesota, gray wolves were added to the endangered species list in 1974 when their population dipped to about 750, according to the Minnesota-based International Wolf Center. Gray wolf back from near extinction . Today, the International Wolf Center lists the gray wolf population in the Great Lakes area as ""increasing/stable."" Gray wolves were removed from federal protection earlier this year, and as a result, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources assumed state management of the species. The state initially had a five-year waiting period for hunting after wolf delisting, but the Minnesota Legislature knocked that down. ""The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service put faith in the state wildlife agencies to responsibly manage wolf populations, but their overzealous and extreme plans to allow for trophy hunting and recreational trapping immediately after de-listing demonstrate that such confidence was unwarranted,"" Wayne Pacelle, the Humane Society's president and CEO, said in a statement. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which would not comment on the pending legal action, said gray wolves are thriving. ""Wolves total more than 4,000 animals in the three core recovery states (Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin) in the western Great Lakes area,"" said Georgia Parham, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman. ""The region's gray wolf population and distribution have exceeded recovery goals since at least 2001 and far exceed minimum population goals in each of the three states,"" she said in an e-mail to CNN. CNN Photos: Trophy hunters chase African wildlife . The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources estimates the state's wolf population to be about 3,000 wolves and says the target harvest of 400 wolves ""is a conservative approach that does not pose a threat to the conservation of the population."" The wolf hunting and trapping season closes January 31 or whenever the 400 wolves are hunted, whichever comes first. More than 23,000 hunters entered the lottery to participate in the wolf hunting season, and 6,000 licenses will be given out. ""We are confident state and tribal wildlife managers will continue to effectively manage healthy wolf populations,"" Parham said. ""The (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), as is required under the Endangered Species Act, is monitoring the western Great Lakes wolf population, and if it appears, at any time, that the status of the gray wolf may again warrant the protections of the Endangered Species Act, the service can initiate the normal or emergency listing process."" Goldman says The Humane Society's research demonstrates otherwise. ""We were given an estimate of 3,000 wolves in our state. We are going to have a harvest of 400. There will be another 300 wolves that will be killed under the depredation programs, and we are estimating another 300 wolves will be killed illegally, so that's a total of 1,000 wolves already. That's a third of the wolf population, and many biologists say that the tipping point of when the population begins to decline is 30%, so we are right there,"" he said. Chris Niskanen, the communications director for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, said the state's wolf population met federal standards for recovery nearly a decade ago and that they have some of the highest wolf densities they have ever had. As the wolf population rises, so do human-wolf conflicts. In general, wolves mainly prey on deer, moose and beaver, but the International Wolf Center says that wherever they coexist, wolves may prey on domestic animals. ""We have a stake in making sure that wolves remain on the landscape here. It is a high priority for us,"" Niskanen said. ""In addition to that mission, our job is to reduce human-wolf conflicts."" ""We hope that this first hunting and trapping season will give us a lot of information,"" he added, ""so we can manage the wolves' population and reduce conflicts at the same time."" But Goldman holds a different opinion. ""The only reason there is a wolf harvest is to satisfy hunters, they are having the hunt for trophies, for sport,"" he said. ""We are saying, stay back, what's the rush, they were just delisted, study this population. We have to err on the side of the caution. This is a population that was driven virtually to extinction.""","Minnesota hunters will be able to hunt gray wolves for first time next month .

The stop in South Korea is part of Bush's weeklong Asian tour. ""Our relationship is important vital and I believe it is strong,"" Bush said. Bush said he was still concerned about North Korea and said the country has a long way to go before it is taken off his ""axis of evil list"" as well as removing it from a list of countries that sponsor terrorism.

"(CNN) -- Online acquaintances wished fair winds and following seas to Joshua Hakken as he fled to Cuba, a strange refuge for a professed fan of Ron Paul. Hakken, his wife and their two sons, 2-year-old Chase and 4-year-old Cole, were at a marina on the communist-ruled island when CNN found them aboard their small sailboat Tuesday. Florida authorities believe Hakken sailed there after abducting the two boys from the Tampa home of their grandmother, who was granted custody after Hakken's 2012 arrest on drug charges in Louisiana. ""This all just seems like the government is yet again making real criminals out of non-violent peaceful freedom lovers,"" wrote one commenter on ""Adam Vs. The Man,"" a libertarian web forum. The family's Cuban sojourn may be short-lived, as the government there announced Tuesday that it would hand them over to U.S. authorities. A man identifying himself as Hakken -- ""a father, a registered professional mechanical engineer and a veteran of the USAF"" -- joined the Adam Vs. The Man discussion board in February 2012 under the handle ""Sailingbull."" ""I am absolutely devoted to life, liberty, the rights of the individual and the Constitution of the United States of America,"" he wrote. ""Mr. Ron Paul is the ONLY politician I have ever admired or supported. It is unimaginable what the forces at be are doing and want to do to him."" Paul, the former Texas congressman, ran for president as a Republican in 2008 and 2012 and once as the Libertarian Party nominee, in 1988. Hakken vounteered to help Paul supporters scout out campsites near last year's Republican convention in Tampa, posting photos of site possibilities on the message board. CNN has not been able to independently confirm Hakken's identity on site, and Adam Vs. The Man founder Adam Kokesh did not respond to requests for comment. But in a post last week, after news that Hakken was wanted in connection with the abduction, he noted, ""I feel like we're in a position to help here. Maybe to reach out to him. Certainly seems like a stupid way to go about this, regardless of what your moral assessment is."" Both Hakken and his wife, Sharyn, held professional engineering certificates -- hers in civil engineering, his in the mechanical and fire-protection specialties, according to state records. After high school, he attended the Air Force Academy in Colorado from June 1996 to May 1998, academy spokesman Meade Warthen told CNN. Online, Hakken said he left because of a previously undiagnosed spinal condition; Warthen said the academy couldn't comment on the reason for his withdrawal. The couple's legal woes began last June with what police called a ""disturbance"" at a hotel in Slidell, Louisiana, just east of New Orleans. ""When police arrived, both Mr. and Mrs. Hakken were acting in a bizarre manner that alarmed officers,"" a Slidell police statement recounts. ""They were talking about 'completing their ultimate journey' and were traveling across the country to 'take a journey to the Armageddon.' Let it be noted that both of their children were present in the hotel room at the time."" Police said they found both drugs and weapons in the room and called in the state Office of Child Services, which ""determined that the children were in danger"" and took them into their custody. Hakken was charged with marijuana possession, possession of drug paraphernalia and the use of a controlled substance around minors; ""Officers also took custody of several weapons for safe keeping."" The Office of Child Services told CNN it would not comment on the case. The children were put into foster care with a family in Tangipahoa Parish, north of Lake Pontchartrain. Two weeks after the arrest, the foster mother called 911 and told dispatchers, ""I need a cop now. I have a guy at my house with a gun."" ""I have two foster children, and it's their dad ... I don't hear banging, but I'm not getting out 'til a cop car gets here,"" she said. Hakken left without the boys, who later were sent to live with Patricia Hauser, Sharyn Hakken's mother, in Tampa. On April 2, a Louisiana court terminated the couple's parental rights, investigators say. The following day, Hillsborough County authorities say Hakken entered Hauser's home, tied her up and took off in her Toyota Camry with the boys. Three and a half hours later, surveillance video captured their recently-purchased sailboat heading into the Gulf of Mexico.

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama had a clear message in interviews with two of America's largest Spanish-language broadcast television networks on Wednesday: Immigration reform is coming soon. A group of lawmakers are close to working out the details of their proposal, Obama said. ""I'm actually very optimistic that when they return in early April we will see a bill ready to move through the process,"" he told Telemundo. ""The most important thing is that we are seeing a strong compromise to resolve the problem,"" he said. ""I've got my own legislation, I'm prepared to step in, but I don't think that's going to be necessary."" In another interview that aired at the same time on Univision, the president made a similar point. ""My sense is that they are close,"" Obama told Univision. ""My expectation is we'll see a bill on the floor of the Senate next month."" His comments to Telemundo and Univision -- in interviews that were conducted in English and aired in dubbed Spanish -- were part of the president's latest push to ignite congressional movement on immigration reform. If a bill is introduced next month, Obama told Telemundo he was ""confident we can get it done certainly before the end of the summer."" Last week a source familiar with the immigration reform proposal negotiations said a bipartisan group of eight senators had tentatively agreed to some of the stickiest issues, like a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and metrics for securing the border. But there was a key issue that had yet to be resolved: how to construct a guest worker program for the future. The senators were haggling over details like how much low-skilled guest workers would be paid, and how many workers would be allowed into the country each year, the source said. According to the source, the eight senators -- four Democrats and four Republicans, who released the framework for their plan in January -- were confident last week that they would be ready to unveil the highly anticipated immigration bill early in the week of April 8, when Congress returns to work. On Wednesday, Obama told Telemundo he didn't think the debate over guest workers would derail reform efforts. ""I disagree that it's threatening to doom the legislation. ... I think there is commitment among this group of Democratic and Republican senators to get this done,"" he said. The interviews aired hours after the White House announced that Obama would be traveling to Mexico and Costa Rica in May, a topic Obama also touched on. When the reporters from Telemundo and Univision both noted that many Latin American governments do not feel like they're a priority for the Obama administration, the president described his upcoming trip. ""I'm really looking forward to the opportunity to visit Mexico. I'm going to be there in early May,"" Obama told Telemundo. ""Sometimes the relationship gets characterized as being just about borders or just about drug cartels. There is so much more in terms of commerce, trade and energy.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government is at risk of being unable to fight off attacks on the nation's computer networks unless it strengthens its cyber-security work force, according to a report released Wednesday. President Obama calls cyber security ""one of the most serious"" challenges facing the nation. The nation's security could be in jeopardy because not enough workers  are sufficiently trained to protect computer systems from hackers, criminals, terrorists and foreign governments, the Partnership for Public Service and consulting company Booz Allen Hamilton found after studying 18 federal agencies and interviewing experts inside and outside government. President Obama has said the cyber threat is ""one of the most serious economic and national security challenges"" facing the nation. In May he announced his intention to create the post of cyber-security coordinator to oversee ""a new comprehensive approach to securing America's digital infrastructure."" ""The overriding finding of our analysis is that our federal government will be unable to combat these threats without a more coordinated, sustained effort to increase cyber-security expertise in the federal work force,"" the report, titled ""Cyber IN-Security,"" states. The report cites four challenges facing the government: an inadequate supply of potential new information technology experts; uncoordinated leadership of cyber-security workers; a cumbersome hiring process that discourages people from seeking government jobs and fails to provide a career path for those who do; and hiring managers and human resource specialists who disagree on the quality of IT candidates. The report recommends that the coordinator develop a strategy for recruiting, training and retaining cyber-security experts. The report also recommends the White House reach out to universities and the private sector to encourage Americans to develop technological skills, similar to what previous administrations did during the space race. The study calls on the Office of Personnel and Management to fix the federal hiring process, create a cyber-security career path and expedite security clearances. It suggests Congress provide significant funding for training federal workers in ""state of the art"" technologies and for college scholarships in the cyber- security field. Partnership for Public Service is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization devoted to building a better federal work force.

"(CNN) -- Arsenal scored three late goals to beat Norwich City 3-1 at the Emirates on Saturday and move up to third in the English Premier League. The Gunners went behind to a Michael Turner header in the 56th minute and looked to be heading towards defeat with five minutes left on the clock. But in a remarkable turnaround, Arsene Wenger's side scored three goals in seven minutes to steal all three points. Mikel Arteta began the fightback, scoring from the penalty spot in the 85th after Kei Kamara was adjudged to have brought down Olivier Giroud. It was Giroud who gave Arsenal the lead three minutes later touching in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross to send home fans delirious. Join the debate with CNN FC . The comeback was completed when Lukas Podolski scored a third in injury time to hand Arsenal their eighth league win in ten games. Norwich, on the other hand, have won just one of their last ten and remain in danger of being dragged back into a relegation battle. ""No-one could predict we would score three goals, but we have great attitude, spirit and desire and it got us there. We deserved to win but we were against a strong side and needed something special,"" Arsene Wenger said after the match. The win takes Arsenal above London rivals Chelsea -- who play Manchester City in the FA Cup semifinal at Wembley on Sunday -- and Tottenham Hotspur. In Saturday's other English Premier League fixtures, Everton kept up their push for a Champions League place next season with a 2-0 over Queens Park Rangers. The win leaves them three points behind fifth place Spurs (58 points) and five points clear of Merseyside rivals Liverpool who played out a goalless draw at Reading -- a result which helps neither side. Reading remain bottom of the table with 24 points, while Harry Redknapp's QPR, who also have 24 points, look destined for the drop now with just five games remaining. Aston Villa remain in 16th place after 1-1 draw against Fulham, while mid-table West Ham United and Southampton also played out a 1-1 draw. Third-from-bottom Wigan may be threatened with relegation but their fans won't be thinking about that this weekend after a 2-0 win over championship side Millwall in the semifinal of the FA Cup. Goals from Shaun Maloney and Callum McManaman ensured Wigan reached the final of England's most prestigious cup competition for the first time in their 81-year history.","Arsenal beat Norwich 3-1 to go third in English Premier League .

World Tourism Organization said Monday. All regions had increased tourist arrivals in 2010 after the 4 percent global decline in tourism in 2009, but Europe and Africa grew more slowly, the Madrid-based UNWTO said in a statement. ""The recovery in international tourism is good news, especially for those developing countries that rely on the sector for much-needed revenue and jobs,"" said Taleb Rifai, UNWTO secretary-general. ""The challenge now will be to consolidate this growth over the coming years amid a still uncertain global economic environment"". Asia was the first region to recover and the strongest growing region in 2010, with a 13 percent increase. International tourist arrivals into Asia reached a new record at 204 million last year, up from 181 million in 2009. The Middle East registered a 14 percent increase, to 60 million tourist arrivals, the UNWTO said. The Americas overall grew by 8 percent, to 151 million international tourist arrivals. Growth was strongest in South America but the improving U.S. economy also helped improve the region's results. Africa grew by 6 percent in 2010, to 49 million tourist arrivals, helped by such events as the FIFA World Cup in South Africa. In 2009, it was only region in the world not to have a decline in international tourism, the UNWTO said. Europe, the world's top destination for international tourism, with 471 million arrivals, grew just 3 percent in 2010, in part due to air traffic disruptions caused by ash from a volcanic eruption in Iceland and ""the economic uncertainty affecting the euro zone,"" the UNWTO said. UNWTO forecast continued tourism sector growth this year but at a slower pace, for a 4 percent to 5 percent increase in 2011, which is slightly above the long-term average. The slower growth predicted in 2011 is due in part to ""persistent high unemployment "" in parts of the world, and recent moves by various governments to introduce or increase ""taxation on travel as a means of balancing public accounts,"" the UNWTO said.","International tourist arrivals increased 6.7 percent .

"(EW.com) -- With Tara (Maggie Siff) being led away in handcuffs in ""Sons of Anarchy's"" season 5 finale, it's no surprise that Wendy (Drea de Matteo), Jax's ex-wife and mother of his first-born, Abel, will be back in the picture in season 6. As TV Line was the first to report, de Matteo will reprise her role in multiple episodes. EW has confirmed the return engagement starts with the season 6 premiere in September. In the December finale, Tara had wanted Jax to sign legal documents naming Wendy as their sons' legal guardian should anything happen to them. But after Tara's arrest for conspiring to murder the prison nurse Otto stabbed with the crucifix she'd brought him, Jax tore the papers in half. He'd recently shot up recovering addict Wendy with heroin to discredit her should she try to pursue a custody battle for Abel, so we wouldn't expect him to welcome her help now. 'Dexter': Yvonne Strahovski returning . Chatting with reporters last fall, de Matteo said she believed Wendy's motives for wanting to form a relationship with Abel were pure: ""I think she is, probably after all of the treatment that she's been through and now becoming a counselor herself, the healthiest of the bunch. It's pretty crazy.... It's like watching a child grow up, to a certain degree. I think in the very beginning of the series she was extremely, extremely vulnerable. At first she was mess, then she was sober and a raw nerve. Now she comes back with her confidence in tact and not wanting to stir any sâ€” up except to be a responsible party. And it seems the whole entire world has imploded, and she's gonna have a hard time maneuvering within it because nobody's stable over there. She's now become the face of stability (Laughs), which is kind of funny."" Connie Britton cast as Adam Driver GF .

"(CNN) -- The driver in Thursday's bus crash in Texas was investigated but not indicted in a fatal accident 15 years ago, according to court documents. Two people were killed and dozens rushed to hospitals after a charter bus bound for Oklahoma overturned on a Dallas-area turnpike Thursday morning. The driver is 65-year-old Loyd Rieve, the Texas Department of Public Safety said. He was investigated in a 1998 accident, but a grand jury declined to indict him on a charge of criminally negligent homicide. In that accident, Rieve was driving a bus that ran over a good Samaritan helping at an accident scene. 2 killed in Dallas-area bus crash . The bus driver was injured in the Thursday accident, which occurred on the President George Bush Turnpike in Irving. It involved only one vehicle. Department of Public Safety spokesman Sgt. Lonny Haschel told CNN the bus went off the right side of the road, hit a barrier, swerved left across lanes of traffic and struck a concrete median in a grassy area. ""It rode up on top of that concrete barrier, and then rolled on its right hand side, where it came to rest,"" Haschel said. The bus, owned by Dallas-area charter company Cardinal Coach Line, was taking passengers to Choctaw Casino in Durant, Oklahoma, the department said. Haschel said it's too early to determine a cause. Investigators are looking at several factors, including the vehicle and physical evidence on the road. The National Transportation Safety Board said it has sent two investigators to the scene of the wreck. ""It's going to be a lengthy investigation,"" Haschel said. CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","A grand jury declined to indict him on a charge of criminally negligent homicide 15 years ago .

"(CNN) -- Argentina star Lionel Messi has cemented his status as the greatest player on the planet by becoming the first player to win FIFA's prestigious Ballon d'Or title on four separate occasions. The Barcelona forward, who broke a number of records in 2012, beat teammate Andres Iniesta and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo to an award voted for by national coaches, captains and journalists. The 25-year-old polled 41.60% of the votes, ahead of Ronaldo on 23.68% and Iniesta with 10.91%, to win his fourth title in a row. Messi's fourth FIFA crown elevates him above the two players with three titles apiece: former Brazil forward Ronaldo (1996, 1997, 2002) and Frenchman Zinedine Zidane (1998, 2000, 2003). ""To tell you the truth, this is really quite unbelievable,"" he said at Monday's awards ceremony in the Swiss city Zurich. ""The fourth award that I have had is just too great for words."" ""I would like to recognize my other colleagues from Barcelona: Iniesta, it has been great to train and play alongside you. I would also like to recognize all of my friends in the Argentinian national team. ""Everyone that has worked with me coaches and staff and my family and my friends. Also my wife and my son. Thank you."" Messi ended the year with 91 goals to his name as he beat the previous record mark of goals scored in a calendar year -- the 85 converted by Germany's Gerd Muller in 1972. In addition, the diminutive forward set a new record for the European Champions League by scoring 14 goals during the 2011-12 campaign, a period when he became the first man to score five goals in a game in the competition (against Bayer Leverkusen). 2008 FIFA World Footballer of the Year Ronaldo had to settle for second place for the third time, after runner-up finishes to Messi in both 2009 and 2011. Meanwhile, Vicente del Bosque -- whose Spain side became the first team to successfully defend the European Championship -- was named Coach of the Year. The 62-year-old won 34.51% of the vote, with Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho second (20.49%) and Messi's former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola third (12.91%). It was a good night for Spain, which not only swept the major awards but whose La Liga provided every single member of the FIFA FIFPro World XI following a poll of 50,00 professional players from all over the world. The FIFA Puskas award for the year's best goal -- which was voted for by more than five million fans in an online poll -- was awarded to Galatasaray's Slovakian striker Miroslav Stoch for his superb volley against Turkish league rivals Genclerbirligi. United States striker Abby Wambach won the FIFA Women's World Player of the Year award for the first time while her former coach, Pia Sundhage, who led the U.S. to its second Olympic gold medal at London 2012, was named Women's Coach of the Year. Sundhage is now in charge of Sweden's women's team. The FIFA Ballon d'Or was awarded for the third time following the 2010 amalgamation of the FIFA World Player of the Year award with the France Football Ballon d'Or, which was popularly known as the European Footballer of the Year award.

"(CNN) -- The second Powerball ticket holder in last month's record jackpot has come forward to claim winnings worth nearly $200 million before taxes, the Arizona Lottery said Friday. ""It is difficult to express just how thankful we are for this wonderful gift,"" said the winner, a married man in his 30s whom the lottery said it would not identify publicly, at his request. ""We are extremely grateful and feel fortunate to now have an increased ability to support our charities and causes. Obviously, this has been incredibly overwhelming, and we have always cherished our privacy."" The message directed reporters to the law firm Rhoads & Sinon LLP in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which did not immediately return a call on Friday night. The winner lives in Fountain Hills, northeast of Phoenix, said Karen Bach, director of budget, communications and products at the Arizona Lottery. He and his wife relocated there about a year ago from Pennsylvania and had played Powerball in Arizona only twice, she said. The $587.6 million jackpot from the November 28 drawing had a cash option of $384.7 million before taxes. The Arizona winner has opted to take cash, $192.5 million, before taxes. Fake lottery winner may be Facebook's most shared photo . On the day of the drawing, he went to 4 Sons Food Store in Fountain Hills, ""handed the clerk a $20 bill and he said, 'I'd like 10 in Quick Pick Powerball tickets,'"" she told reporters. ""The retailer tried to encourage him to spend the entire $20 and he said, 'No, $10 is all I want to spend.' Clearly, that was enough."" He left his ticket overnight on the sun visor in his vehicle and retrieved it the next day, after he and his wife heard there had been a winner in Arizona. Then they compared the numbers on the ticket against those posted on the lottery website, she said. ""They checked the numbers over and over again and were just absolutely shocked,"" Bach said. Since then, the couple has assembled a legal and financial team to guide them through the process and began meeting with them on Monday, going so far as to use a whiteboard to write down how they wanted to allocate their newfound assets, Bach said. Columns on the whiteboard included entries for financial, legal and ""fun,"" she said. The couple opted to claim the prize before the end of the year ""because of concerns over the fiscal cliff in 2013,"" she said. The winnings are to be awarded on about December 14, said Jeff Hatch-Miller, executive director of the Arizona Lottery. Hatch-Miller, who met Friday morning with the winner in a hotel suite in Scottsdale, said the winner likes what he does and has no immediate plans to change it. ""The winner said, 'You know, I like my job; I'd like to continue working my job,'"" Hatch-Miller said. He described the man's work as ""just a regular job, like yours or mine -- it's not a high-level job."" The winner's anonymity is not likely to last. A spokeswoman for the Arizona Lottery, Cindy Esquer, said it would release his name on Monday to news organizations that file Freedom of Information Act requests for it. Two winners from Missouri claimed their half of the jackpot on November 30. The prize is considered income by the IRS, meaning that the highest federal tax rate of 35% will apply. Each winner would therefore owe $67 million to the IRS, said Mark Luscombe, principal analyst at tax research firm CCH, in an interview last month. State taxes will also apply. In Arizona, a resident who has the winning ticket will be charged a 5% tax on the prize money. If a non-resident bought the winning ticket, a 6% rate will apply. The resulting tax bill will be either $10 million or $11 million, according to CCH. Ohio cops share $1million Powerball prize . Missouri charges residents and non-residents a 4% tax, making the tax liability there nearly $8 million. Taking both state and federal taxes into consideration means the Arizona winner would owe up to $78 million in taxes and take home $114 million. The Missouri winner's tax bill would total about $75 million, leaving a take of $117.5 million. However, in either case, the amount paid in state taxes could likely be deducted on the winners' federal tax returns, lowering the overall tax liability slightly.","NEW: Winner expresses thanks while seeking privacy .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona will meet arch-rival Real Madrid in the semifinal of the Copa del Rey after Leo Messi fired the Catalans past Malaga Thursday. The Argentina international scored his 40th goal of the season as Barca claimed a 4-2 win to prevail 6-4 on aggregate and set up two more 'El Clasico' games. It will give Barcelona, which is top of La Liga, the opportunity to avenge its defeat by Jose Mourinho's men in the 2010 final. Messi and Ronaldo ensure honors shared in 222nd El Clasico . With Real trailing Barca by 15 points in the league, Mourinho will be desperate to regain the trophy which Pep Guardiola lifted in his final game in charge at the Camp Nou last season. But if the current Spanish champions are to triumph, they will have to stop Messi and his accomplices, who continue to prosper despite the absence of coach Tito Vilanova. Vilanova, who is undergoing treatment for cancer, left deputy Jordi Roura in charge, but it made little difference as Barca continued its hot streak. The statistics are frightening. Barcelona have now scored 100 goals in its 34 goals this season. It is the fourth year in succession that Messi has reached the 40-goal mark, while his late header also made it 23 goals in his past 15 starts. With the tie level at 2-2 going into the second leg, Barcelona made the perfect start when Pedro headed home after just eight minutes. Messi leads Barcelona to new record . But Malaga fought back and Joaquin equalized four minutes later with a neat finish following wonderful interplay. Although far from its fluent best, Barcelona picked up in the second half and Gerard Pique netted four minutes after the interval only for Roque Santa Cruz to pull Malaga level once again. But Barca continued to look threatening and a wonderful flowing move ended with Cesc Fabregas threading the ball through for Andres Iniesta to stroke home. There was still time for Messi's customary goal, running through the middle to head home Dani Alves' cross from close-range and kill off any hopes of a Malaga comeback. More than a game: Austerity gives El Clasico new twist . In the night's other game, Atletico Madrid booked its place in the last four with a 1-1 draw at Real Betis to progress 3-1 on aggregate. Diego Costa put Atletico ahead on the stroke of halftime with Jorge Molina scoring from the penalty spot late on. Atletico will now face Sevilla in the semifinal. Bilbao forward Llorente opens talks with Juventus . Meanwhile, Italian champion Juventus confirmed the signing of Spain forward Fernando Llorente. The 27-year-old, who will arrive in Turin on July 1 when his current deal with Athletic Bilbao expires, has signed a four-year contract. A statement from the club said: ""Juventus can confirm that Spanish international striker Fernando Llorente will join the club on 1 July 2013. ""The 27-year-old has agreed terms on a four-year deal and will move to Turin when his Athletic Bilbao contract expires at the end of the current season."" Elsewhere, AC Milan has signed defender Cristian Zaccardo from Parma in a deal which has seen Djamel Mesbah go the other way.","Barcelona will play Real Madrid in the semifinal of the Copa del Rey .

"(CNN) -- The woman charged in a deadly day care fire that killed four small children is expected to be back in Texas within the next 24 hours, a U.S. Congresswoman said Monday. Jessica Tata, who has dual citizenship in the U.S. and Nigeria, fled to Lagos shortly after the fatal fire at her Houston home in February. She arrived in Atlanta early Monday morning and was booked into Fulton County Jail, officials said in a statement. Tata also made an appearance in magistrate court, where she waived her extradition rights. According to U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, arrangements are being made for her transport back to Texas. However, Lee did not know exactly when Tata would arrive in Houston or how she would be traveling. Investigators allege that Tata, a 22-year-old day care owner, left seven children alone at her Houston day care center with the stove on while she went to a store in February. Four children died, and three others were injured in the blaze. Tata was taken into custody Saturday in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, by Interpol and U.S. diplomatic security agents, officials said. At a news conference Monday, Lee said Tata turned herself in to authorities after a ""monumental"" effort between the U.S. and Nigerian governments, along with Tata's family in Lagos. ""We now have the opportunity to move forward,"" Lee said, adding that she worked closely with the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and spoke with the Nigerian ambassador to the U.S. to make sure Tata's return was a ""top priority."" On Sunday, Lee gathered with Houston's Nigerian community for a memorial service in honor of the four children lost in the fire, where ministers ""pleaded"" for Tata to return home. U.S. marshals were asked to join the search by Harris County authorities after Tata left the Houston area. They added the missing woman to their 15 Most Wanted Fugitives list in March. Tata has been indicted on felony charges in the fatal fire, including four counts of manslaughter, six counts of reckless injury to a child, three counts of abandoning a child under 15 and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. The Harris County district attorney's office said it would not comment on the case until Tata is back in its custody. CNN's Antoinette Campbell contributed to this report.","NEW: Jessica Tata expected back in Texas within 24 hours, lawmaker says .

"(CNN) -- Chinese amateur golfer Guan Tianlang was not even born when Tiger Woods won the Masters for the first time in 1997. Guan will become the youngest player in Masters history when he tees off on Thursday, eclipsing the mark set by Italy's Matteo Manassero in 2010 . And on Monday, the Chinese teenager -- aged 14 years, five months and 14 days -- was given a helping hand by Woods after the 14-time major winner invited Guan to take in the back nine of the fabled Augusta course. Guan qualified for the year's first major by winning November's Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship, an event designed specifically to unearth global talent. It was the third time the teenager had played with world No. 1 Woods, with the pair joined on their Monday practice round by big-hitting American Dustin Johnson. ""He gives me advice and I will say every time I play with him I feel a lot better and give myself confidence,"" Guan told the PGA Tour's official website. ""I'm not going to push myself too hard. I'm trying to just enjoy my game, play my best and hopefully play a good score."" Woods, who goes into this weekend's tournament as favorite to clinch a fifth Masters crown, is pleased his legacy has helped created a new generation of players. Opinion: For Tiger, winning does take care of everything . ""It's frightening to think that he was born after I won my first Masters,"" the 37-year-old said after winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational a few weeks ago. ""It's exciting that I've inspired kids to play and not just here in the States, but obviously in China and around the world."" At the other end of the age scale, Northern Irishman Darren Clarke, aged 44, was hoping to take part in his 12th Masters. But the 2011 British Open champion has been forced to withdraw with the same hamstring injury which kept him out of last week's Valero Texas Open. Clarke was one of Jose Maria Olazabal's vice captains when he led Europe to a stunning Ryder Cup victory against the United States at Medinah in September. Meanwhile Spain's Olazabal, a two-time champion at Augusta, hit a wayward drive during the first day of practice which left a male spectator with blood pouring from his head. Olazabal, the last European to wear the green jacket, immediately apologized and offered the stricken fan a signed glove.

"(CNN) -- A new round of Apple rumors and leaks are suggesting what some tech observers have been predicting for the past year: that a smaller, less expensive iPad is on the way. The talk of a 7-or-8-inch version of the popular tablet (the current model has a nearly 10-inch screen, diagonally), comes on the heels of Google announcing plans for the Nexus 7, its own smaller tablet that will be more in the mold of Amazon's Kindle Fire. The Nexus 7 will have a 7-inch screen and sell for $199 like the Fire, which has been one of the few iPad rivals to gain any real traction in the tablet marketplace. Finally, Apple owns the name 'iPad' On Wednesday, Bloomberg was quoting ""two people with knowledge of the plans"" who said Apple will release a smaller iPad by the end of the year. The so far the imaginary, or at least never-seen, device has been dubbed the ""iPad Mini"" by speculators in light of the iPod of the same name. The sources said the gadget will have a screen between 7 and 8 inches wide, and one said that it will not have the high-definition ""retina display"" screen of the new iPad. Apple rumors can be an amusingly hit-or-miss affair, with random speculation often gaining critical online mass among the millions of diehard Apple fans (or, for that matter, detractors) always on the lookout for what might be coming next. But as the months have gone on, more and more analysts have begun to believe that the arrival of a smaller iPad is a matter of ""when,"" not ""if."" Multiple tech sites also are pointing this week to a post from Chinese tech site MyDrivers (Google translation) which quoted sources on Apple's supply chain in that country saying the new device will have a 7.85-inch screen and be the same thickness as the iPad 2. Despite a growing tide of ""evidence"" (a term used with a hearty grain of salt here), not all tech observers are convinced. ""So, will there be a smaller version of the iPad? At the moment, there's not enough evidence to say and, if anything, on balance it's most likely not to be the case,"" blogger Jamie Condliffe wrote for Gizmodo U.K. ""But that doesn't mean we can rule it out. Fortunately, speculation that the device could be launched by the end of year fits with the Apple's usual October iPhone announcement -- so you might not have to wait too long to find out."" If the rumors are true, it would be Apple's biggest departure yet from the vision of co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs, who died last year. 5 ways the iPhone changed our lives . Jobs was adamant that anything smaller than the iPad wouldn't deliver the full ""tablet experience."" ""This size isn't sufficient to create great tablet apps in our opinion,"" he said of 7-inch tablets in October 2010, during Apple's quarterly earnings report. ""Apple's done extensive user testing on touch interfaces over many years, and we really understand this stuff. ""There are clear limits of how close you can physically place elements on a touch screen before users cannot reliably tap, flick or pinch them. This is one of the key reasons we think the 10-inch screen size is the minimum size required to create great tablet apps."" Apple wins ban on two Android devices: What it means for you .

"(CNN) -- World champion Jorge Lorenzo may have thought new teammate Valentino Rossi would be his biggest threat of the new MotoGP season, but a surprise name will be at the head of the grid for Saturday's revamped final qualifying session in Qatar. Rookie Marc Marquez, making his debut for Repsol Honda following the retirement of Casey Stoner and the departure of Andrea Dovizioso, snatched top spot from Lorenzo's Yamaha by just one-thousandth of a second in Friday's third practice. ""Practice today went pretty well -- better than expected,"" Marquez said. ""I was very comfortable on the bike and this is the important thing. ""What we are missing is a bit of pace and consistency. We will have to make the most of the 30 minutes that we have before qualifying tomorrow to improve those points."" Under new rules for motorcycling's elite class, the top 10 riders automatically go through to ""Q2"" to decide the leading start positions for Sunday's opening race, while in the earlier ""Q1"" the rest will fight for the remaining two spots to take part the pole position shootout. ""It's separated qualifying, so that the fastest group runs together and the slowest group runs together,"" race director Mike Webb said. ""It's one thing for the show, and the other really big reason is for the safety of the riders; each rider group will get a clear race track and be better able to do their best lap time."" Splitting the sessions will also give the sponsors of smaller teams more television exposure, the MotoGP website said. Most eyes will be watching seven-time world champion Rossi, who has returned to Yamaha after two unsuccessful seasons with Ducati. ""The practices were not so bad, but we are continuing to work for the race,"" Rossi said. ""We still have to decide which tire to use; that will be very important for Sunday."" The Italian earned fourth place in the practice sessions, behind Britain's Cal Crutchlow on a Monster Yamaha Tech 3. Compatriot Dovizioso, his replacement at Ducati, claimed sixth place ahead of last season's championship runnerup Dani Pedrosa -- who was outshone by his new Honda colleague Marquez. Another Spanish rider, Alvaro Bautista, was seventh for Honda Gresini while America's 2006 world champion Nicky Hayden was eighth on the second Ducati ahead of British rookie Bradley Smith on the other Tech 3 and Germany's Stefan Bradl on an LCR Honda. The 20-year-old Marquez has moved up to the top division after winning the Moto2 title last year, and the 125cc class in 2010. With two-time world champion Stoner quitting last season after becoming disillusioned with the sport, there is a gap for Marquez to make his name. However, he will have to show he can be as consistent as Lorenzo, who last season finished in the top two for 16 of 18 races -- with two retirements -- as he claimed his second title in three years. ""I'm very happy with the changes we made on the bike because it improved a lot,"" Lorenzo said. ""I think we can still improve the bike more tomorrow. ""We still haven't decided which chassis is better; today it is the new one, yesterday the old one. I'm very curious to see how the qualifying goes with the new formula -- we will just be concentrating on doing four fast laps and the maximum performance we can get."" Before Saturday's two qualifying sessions, there will be one last practice run for the riders. ""We'll use the first three practices to get the right setups and then probably use the last free practice to do a long run, just to check the race situation,"" Lorenzo's crew chief Ramon Forcada said on the MotoGP website. ""It's not exactly the race distance, but half an hour should be enough -- and then we'll prepare for the time attack!""","Rookie rider Marc Marquez earns fastest time for MotoGP qualifying session .

"(CNN) -- Self-help author and speaker James Arthur Ray announced Thursday that he is postponing all of his scheduled events through the end of the year after the deaths of three people in a sweat lodge session he led. ""In the days following the terrible accident, I struggled to respond in the right way,"" Ray wrote on his Web site Thursday. ""This is the most emotionally wrenching situation I've ever faced, and it's now clear I must dedicate all of my physical and emotional energies to helping bring some sort of closure to this matter. That means helping the authorities and the families get to the bottom of what happened."" Three people died after spending time in the sweat lodge near Sedona, Arizona, on October 8. Nearly 20 others were injured. Two were pronounced dead shortly after they arrived at a hospital, and a third died October 17 after being hospitalized since the incident. Ray wrote last week on his site that he would keep going with his programs ""despite considerable criticism"" because his work is ""too important"" not to continue with it. But in his blog Thursday, he said he now will devote all of his time to assisting authorities in their investigation. ""For that reason, I'm postponing all the events I had planned for the remainder of 2009. These events will be rescheduled as soon as possible in 2010 -- once the essential work that must be done on the Sedona tragedy has been completed,"" Ray wrote. A homicide investigation has begun, law enforcement officials have said. Yavapai County Sheriff Steve Waugh said October 15 that the sweat lodge was meant to be a ""spiritual awakening"" exercise for participants in Ray's Spiritual Warrior program. According to a description of the program on Ray's Web site, participants would learn to ""carve out [their] own destiny and quickly develop the strength and determination to live it"" as they experienced ""a new technologically enhanced form of meditation that creates new neurological pathways, allowing you to experience powerful whole-brain thinking (this one's gonna knock your socks off)."" Each participant paid $9,695 to attend the program at the Angel Valley Retreat Center. One of them was Beverly Bunn of Texas, who described a scene of horror and confusion inside the sweat lodge, a dome-like structure covered with tarps and blankets. Hot rocks and water inside created steam. ""Everybody was throwing up everywhere. There was spitting going on. ... People were so disoriented, they were screaming at one point,"" she said. ""I saw all of these people lying around and mucus coming out of their nose and mouth and eyes rolled back in their heads."" Bunn said the sauna-like conditions sickened several of the people inside. ""They were yelling and yelling, yelling at this man because he was so disoriented that he actually started crawling into the pit with the hot rocks."" Native Americans used sweat lodges in spiritual and physical purification ceremonies. Ray is widely known for programs that claim to teach people how to create wealth from all aspects of their lives: financially, mentally, physically and spiritually. He has appeared on various national programs in the United States, including CNN's ""Larry King Live.""","Three people died after spending time in Arizona sweat lodge this month .

"(CNN) -- With austerity measures exposing sharp ideological rifts between European nations, and a shadow now hanging over the future of the single currency, it's safe to say that relations on the continent have seen better days. With this in mind, a new force has emerged to resuscitate the old ideal of a truly unified Europe. But it's no political party, lobby group or think tank. The latest vehicle flying the flag for EU solidarity (quite literally in this case) is a 30 meter-long, 44 meter-high yacht. According to its founders, the ""Esimit Europa 2"" aims to promote pan-European cooperation and a sense of common identity through the unifying power of sport. ""This boat represents the best of Europe in terms of sailing, and it shows that people from different countries can set their differences aside to compete and win as a team. When you are not working together you can't win, and without winning there is no future,"" said the project's Slovenian co-founder Igor Simcic. ""Esimit Europa 2"" is the only yacht in the world that has been granted the right to fly the blue and gold European flag. It has also won the backing of two of Europe's most powerful men -- the President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, and the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso. Effusive in his support of the yacht, Shulz recently spoke about the importance of such projects: . ""A yacht, navigated by a truly European crew, sailing under the European flag, is a strong symbol of European unity and cooperation. Europe needs such symbols, which have power to unite and inspire,"" he said last month in a specially recorded video message, laden with suitably apt sailing metaphors: . ""Today, more than ever, Europeans are all in the same boat and only together we can ride out of current storm and reach safe harbor. The ""Esimit Europa"" project is a bright example of the optimism that better times are ahead,"" he said. If only Europe's economic prospects really were aligned with the fortune's of the ""Esimit Europa 2"". Its highly experienced 18-man pan-European crew, led by two-time America's Cup winner and three-time German Olympic champion Jochen Schumann, has so far claimed 11 consecutive wins -- breaking two course records in their 2010 rookie season alone. More from Mainsail: Solo adventurer says she's relieved to be back on land . But working with so many nationalities on one boat (the crew is composed of representatives from six EU countries) poses evident communication problems. ""To become successful we had to agree on a common language,"" says skipper Schumann. ""We chose English for obvious reasons, but as people don't have that many words in their personal English dictionary we've ended up with a very efficient and 'to-the-point' language, which works in our favor during races."" Schumann, who grew up in East Berlin, believes his experiences -- both before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall -- has made him appreciate the vision of a united Europe. ""I am proud to be German, but I am also proud to be European. Being the skipper of this boat is very much like my personal vision for Europe. Of course there are always going to be some Europeans that feel more nationalistic than others -- even in a team like ours -- but as long as we share the same goal and work together we can win,"" he said. However, at the moment there are few instances of teams competing under the European flag, with the rare notable exception of the Ryder Cup - the biennial golf competition between Europe and America. According to the University of Michigan's professor Andrei Markovits, who has written extensively on the connections between sports and politics, the reason there are so few pan-European sports teams reflects the problem of individual emotional engagement. ""In sports where the emotional stakes are very high, such as football or ice hockey, it's unlikely that these (continental) types of teams will appear because people care too much about their clubs and national teams,"" he said. ""In sports where the emotional stakes are low it could work -- but then it will just remain cute and nice, simply because it doesn't matter to people. It's always easy to unite in intellect but not as easy in terms of your guts,"" he added. The greater issue, Markovits argues, is that sport is by its very nature combative. ""In sports you will always have a winner and a loser. It's a zero-sum game. So you have to ask yourself whom is a pan-national team competing against?"" Watch related: The secret world of the America's Cup . As things stand, the ""Esimit Europea 2"" is only scheduled to compete against boats represented in the big European regattas. But if its visionary founder Igor Simcic has anything to do with it, there will soon be a new breed of regatta. ""I think in the future you might see continents or regions race against each other, such as Europe against the U.S. and China,"" he said. But with national anti-European sentiment spreading, and the Euro on the brink of a possible collapse, can a yacht really be the a symbol which unifies a continent? Schümann, at least, believes it can. ""For centuries sailing has been a way of connecting countries and continents,"" he said. ""So I think 'Esimit Europa 2' is a very fitting symbol of what we are trying to achieve -- which is to show the world that we are always stronger if we work together.""","The ""Esimit Europa 2"" yacht was founded to promote unity among EU nations .
Skipper Jochen Schümann is a three time German Olympic champion and two times America's Cup winner .
The project is backed by the Presidents of the European Parliament and the European Commission .
The ""supermaxi"" yacht is 30 meters long and has a top speed of over 38 knots ."
"(CNN) -- She's laid down the law in female skiing for the past five years, now Lindsey Vonn is pondering legal action in her quest to test herself against the men. The International Ski Federation (FIS) blocked her bid to challenge the sport's top male stars at a recent meeting in Canada, but as Vonn has proved throughout her glittering career to date she's no quitter. Speaking exclusively to CNN ahead of an Alpine World Cup event in Val d'Isere, France, the finest female skier of her generation insisted this fight wasn't over. Vonn said: ""I was definitely disappointed with their decision. After discussing with them my request they seemed pretty positive and optimistic that we could find a solution and then I got their answer and they were completely against it. ""I don't want to make a big stink out of it but I feel like their response that I can't race with the men simply because I'm a woman was definitely gender-biased so I'm going to do what I can and hopefully make something work. ""So right now I'm looking into options -- my father is an attorney so I'm just seeing if there's any options, legally, that I can take."" It is a brave person who pits their wits against Vonn. The 28-year-old already has a cabinet stuffed full of silverware, including Olympic gold at Vancouver in 2010, and is officially the second most successful female skier of all time. Vonn is renowned in Europe's skiing heartlands and a bona fide star in North America but she claims a battle with the male fraternity would elevate the sport to new heights in her homeland. She responded to the FIS ruling in typical fashion by sweeping all three downhill events at Lake Louise in Canada, despite crashing during one, and all that on the back of recovering from a stomach illness which left her hospitalized in November. Vonn was also on the podium at the most recent meeting in St. Moritz and is third in the overall standings as she strives for a fifth career Alpine World Cup title. But as she continues her preparation for this weekend's meet at Val d'Isere, her other goal has clearly not been forgotten. ""I don't see Lindsey giving up anytime soon, that's for sure, she'll try another avenue,"" said 1992 Olympic champion Kerrin Lee-Gartner, who thinks Vonn would have finished around 20th had her wish to race the men at Lake Louise been granted. ""She's doing this for her but with that she also appreciates what it'll do for skiing in North America and the United States. People know who she is but they don't really understand the depth of her greatness."" U.S. women's head coach Alex Hoedlmoser agrees with Lee-Gartner. The Austrian, himself a former national giant slalom champion, says Vonn's commitment sets her apart from her competitors. ""It's obvious that she has put all of her energy into the sport in the last five years,"" Hoedlmoser explained to CNN. ""That makes her special. She's living for her sport. She's prepared like nobody else going into races. That makes a difference."" After her new-season successes, the Minnesota native now has a career total of 57 victories, pushing her ahead of Switzerland's Vreni Schnieder and into second on the all-time win list. Only legendary Austrian Annemarie Moser-Proll remains ahead of Vonn, on 62 career victories, a tally that, barring injury, surely she will surpass. ""Moser-Proll was an unbelievable champion and won a lot of races at that time,"" added Hoedlmoser. ""But there wasn't the same competition then. ""The sport is getting more complex, it is harder to break those records. I think she [Vonn] is the greatest so far and it is a matter of time before she breaks those records."" Vonn, a four-time Alpine World Cup champion, lobbied the FIS to race the men at Lake Louise as it is one of the few meets in the skiing calendar where males and females compete on the same slopes. But a diktat from the sport's governing body ruled ""one gender is not entitled to participate in the races of the other."" ""It's not like I'm getting 20th every day and saying I want to race the men,"" Vonn told reporters in Canada. ""I try to let my skiing speak for itself. ""I don't know exactly where I'd stack up, but that's kind of the whole point, to see where I stand and see how much farther I can push my skiing because the men, they're skiing is the best in the world hands down. That's where I want to get my skiing to be."" A perfect illustration of Vonn's supremacy came at the venue that starts the weekend as Lake Louise, and ends it as Lake Lindsey. ""She was near-perfect the first day,"" Lee-Gartner explained. ""On the second day she made a major mistake and it was almost disastrous, she had her tails of her skis in the net, she was almost sideways and she still won by half a second. ""It's difficult for her to maintain the elite level of focus throughout the season. For Lindsey she is very goal orientated, she feeds off any doubt whatsoever. She says it fuels her fire and makes her go."" Vonn is not alone in her quest, and she points to female golfer Anneka Sorenstam as an inspiration in her battle. The Swede, who won 72 times on the LPGA Tour and triumphed in ten major championships, took on the men at a PGA Tour event back in 2003. Prior to the tournament, three-time major winner Vijay Singh said Sorenstam ""didn't belong"" at the tournament. She eventually shot four-over-par and missed the cut, but tied for first in driving accuracy during her first round. Vonn had previously told the New York Times: ""I'd like to have one chance in my life to race against them. Annika Sorenstam did it in golf and paved the way for women. I'm not asking for World Cup points. I just want the chance to compete."" Lee-Gartner says there are plenty of male competitors on the tour who support Vonn's desire but also some who joke she should be allowed to see how she gets on against them on the notoriously treacherous Kitzbuhel track in Austria. But, the FIS aside, there is almost total uniformity within the sport that skiing would benefit from the huge media interest any showdown would attract. ""The more I reflect on who she is, what she's done and how great it would be for this sport, in my opinion it is a marketing opportunity that FIS should be taking,"" Lee-Gartner added. ""I realise in Austria, Switzerland, alpine skiing is one of the premier sports they watch, they don't necessarily have an issue getting people interested in the sport. ""Anytime there's an athlete's presence and profile has surpassed the sport in that nation, which hers has in North America, I think we'd be crazy not to use that opportunity she's handing to us on a platter."" Vonn is already the most successful skier the United States has ever produced, and should she overtake Moser-Proll's record, only one person could claim to have more wins than her -- Sweden's male legend Ingemar Stenmark, on 86. Of Vonn's quest to cross the gender boundary, Hoedlmoser said: ""That's something she really wants, she sees it as the next level of ski racing. She wants to see how far up she is, that's the only goal. ""She can compete with them, it all depends on the snow preparation, what the conditions are. We have situations in training where she trains against men. She's never done it in a race situation and I think that's where she really wants to be."" Vonn is backed by the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association and now seems determined to head down legal avenues to pursue her dream of sharing a slope with the men. Lee-Gartner added: ""I'm not sure if FIS will be able to say yes because they do things in a very old fashioned way. But she's a pioneer and for the first of anything it takes a little bit longer to break the barrier down.""","Skiing sensation Lindsey Vonn is considering legal action in her bid to race men .

"(CNN) -- In the outlying slums of Cairo, people ""drown in oceans of garbage"" and are forced to live with the stench of polluted air, says Mahmoud Gamal, 26, a marketing executive living in Cairo, Egypt's capital. Gamal's comments were made through CNN iReport, which has an assignment on life in Egypt under President Mohamed Morsy. The iReporters describe a life in which many people in the North African nation are facing a daily battle against poverty, spiraling inflation and high unemployment. Morsy, meanwhile, is in negotiations for the country to get an economic rescue package from the International Monetary Fund. Sectarian violence and protests over rising prices and poor wages following the Arab Spring are decimating foreign investment. The country also remains divided over Islamist leader Morsy, who came to power as Egypt's first popularly elected president after Hosni Mubarak was toppled in February 2011. Morsy's office did not respond to a request for comment about the economic situation in his country when contacted by CNN. But, in an exclusive interview with CNN in January, Morsy said: ""To start real stability and development, we may take six months or a year but to reach what we want may take five to 10 years... I'm talking economically."" ""Egyptians don't trust the president and the government,"" Maged Eskander, a 38-year-old architect from the Egyptian capital told CNN iReport. ""They simply don't have the vision, the ability or will to lead the country."" Read more: Why Egypt's transition from its Arab Spring is so painful . When Egyptians descended on Tahrir Square in early 2011, rising against Mubarak's near three decade rule, they did not expect he would be replaced by a ""carbon copy,"" Gamal said. Morsy is making the country's dire economic situation ""worse,"" he added. Egypt -- the Arab world's most populous nation -- is seeking a rescue loan of $4.8 billion from the Washington-based IMF to buoy its ailing economy and a weak currency that is driving up consumer prices. Read more: ElBaradei: Pillars of Egypt's progress . In return, the IMF wants Egypt to overhaul its finances, cut energy subsidies, raise taxes and reduce its budget deficit before offering support. In March, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry released $250 million in economic aid to Egypt, calling it a ""good faith effort"" and urging Morsy to pledge economic and political reforms. Read more: Egypt president's tricky game of power . But Gamal told CNN ordinary Egyptians are already struggling to pay for water and electricity while mothers queue up in bread lines. ""[They] would be lucky if they come back with anything,"" he added. The cost of fuel, particularly diesel, is also on the increase as transport in large parts of the country is paralyzed by shortages of subsidized diesel. Soaring unemployment . Egypt -- one of Africa's largest economies -- is also grappling with a high unemployment rate of 13% and a young workforce that is becoming increasingly frustrated by a lack of skilled jobs. Ahmed Raafat, a 23-year-old unemployed graduate engineer, said Egypt suffered hugely under the iron fist of Mubarak but now ""things are getting even worse."" Raafat believes the policies of Morsy's government are ""crushing"" the country's poor and middle earners. ""It's hard to find a job in Egypt,"" Raafat said. ""Many of my friends are facing the same problems."" According to Gamal: ""University graduates that should be working as journalists, engineers and accountants now work as waiters and taxi drivers."" One major contributor to Egypt's unemployment woes is its tourism-dependent economy, which went into a tail-spin following the revolution. Security concerns in Cairo and the country's top resorts are making would-be holidaymakers look to alternative destinations and forcing employers to scale back. Rafaat said: ""My family works in the tourism industry which many describe as the life blood of Egypt. It has almost dried up due to the lack of security."" But Egypt's tourism minister Hisham Zazou has recently told CNN the industry had cause for optimism. He said Egypt had been enjoying an uptick in tourism and that it was a mistake to think the entire country was dangerous. Since the revolution in 2011, sectarian violence between Coptic Christians and Muslims has marred Egypt's image as a safe country for visitors. This month one person was killed and more than 80 injured in fighting outside the Coptic Othodox Cathedral in central Cairo, where a funeral for four Egyptian Christians, killed in fighting, took place. Hardline Islamists -- repressed under the autocratic rule of Mubarak -- have been given more freedom under the governance of Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood, leading to large-scale religious clashes in Muslim-dominated Egypt. Ninety percent of Egypt's 82 million population is Muslim, while about 9% is made up of Christians. Eskander said the streets of Cairo are ""condensed with anger and frustration"" and the security situation remains ""bad."" He blames police for failing to control the fighting.","Egypt -- the Arab world's most populous nation -- is seeking a rescue loan of $4.8 billion .

"(CNN) -- There are approximately 600 million Catholic women in the world, but none will have a direct say in who the next pope will be. The 115 cardinals voting for the pope are men. One of these men will be chosen to succeed Benedict XVI, continuing an exclusively male club. Or is it? Two movies have been made about Pope Joan, who, according to legend, was a ninth-century Englishwoman who disguised herself under voluminous clerical robes to become a priest, something women are not allowed to be in the Catholic Church. As the story goes, Joan outdid all the men in her religious studies and rose in the ranks of the cardinals to become pope. She then went into labor during a papal procession and the mob descended on her and her child, ending her reign. Diarmaid MacCulloch, a theologian and historian from Oxford University, said the story of Pope Joan is a myth, nothing but satirical fiction. ""It keeps appealing to new anxieties and new interests,"" he said. ""So first it's medieval people who resented the papacy. Then it's Protestants. Then it's French revolutionaries who want to discredit the church. ""The next constituency is actually Catholics who want to see women priests. And this seems to me the most dangerous aspect of the story, because it's using a story which is patently nonsense to boost a good cause."" But Pope Joan still has her believers. Why, they ask, were cardinals asked to sit on a uniquely shaped chair well into the 16th century? Was it a birthing chair? Or, as legend holds, a specially designed seat for checking the next Pope had the right, shall we say, equipment for the job? What about the peculiarly named Vicus Papissa, or Road of the Lady Pope, a medieval alleyway shunned by papal processions? This, according to legend, is where Pope Joan came to an end. There is even a shrine said to be dedicated to her and her child. Historians say the road is named not for Pope Joan, but for the Pape family that lived there. Still, the legend endures, as do calls for women to break through the stained-glass ceiling and have a greater say in the church. At Rome's Church of St. Lucia, the art on the walls highlights the central role that women have had in the church's past. Catholics revere Mary, the mother of Jesus, and church history is replete with female saints who struggled and died for the faith. Others refused to stay silent when they saw evil in the church's ranks: In the 14th century, St. Catherine of Siena famously called the cardinals ""devils in human form."" ""Everyone would like to have more women everywhere, because this is a fact that is not possible to stop: Nowadays, women are very, very strong,"" said Alessandra Candrelli, one of the many women worshiping at the Church of St. Lucia. A bit of female advice might help the church steer its way through troubled waters, said Donna Orsuto, a professor from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. ""It certainly brings more balance when you have contact with women and when you listen to women especially and listen to their perspective,"" she said. ""And I think a lot of the ways that this (abuse) crisis was handled in the church, to have had more women's input in dealing with it would have been a better thing."" Who are the front-runners to replace Benedict XVI? Sister Mary Ann Walsh of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops concedes that the church's hierarchy is male-dominated, but said women do occupy important lay positions in Catholic social and relief organizations. ""If you take ordination off the table, in the U.S. our statistics are better than the Department of Labor when it comes to women in executive positions,"" Walsh said. For now, however, women have at best an indirect influence on the Vatican's upper echelon. ""Certainly the church is not a democratic society in the way civil society understands,"" said Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins of Portugal. ""It's a hierarchical church, therefore not everyone is equal."" Women's voices might be louder than before, but will there ever be a female pope? MacCulloch said he could see it happening one day. ""It's surprising how quickly these things happen once the idea gets around,"" he said. ""But don't hold your breath.""","The Vatican's upper echelon appears to be an exclusive men's club .
Women aren't allowed to be ordained as priests, so they cannot become pope .
Still, many women hold executive lay positions in Catholic organizations .
Some believe there was once a female pope; movies have been made about the medieval tale ."
"(CNN) -- With the carnage in Syria mounting out of control, there's only one thing left to do, France says: Lift a European Union embargo and start arming rebels. ""We must convince our partners, particularly in Europe, that we have no other choice but lift the arms embargo in favor of the (opposition) Syrian Coalition,"" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius wrote in an op-ed for the French newspaper Liberation. ""We must go ahead and allow the Syrian people to defend themselves against this bloodthirsty regime. It's our responsibility to help the Syrian National Coalition, its leaders and the (rebel) Free Syrian Army by all the possible means. ""If not,"" Fabius warned, ""the slaughter will continue, and there will not be any other possible outcome but to strengthen the most extreme groups and the collapse of Syria with devastating consequences for the country itself and the region."" The cost of war: 2 million Syrian children afflicted . The UK also hints of change . France isn't alone. British Foreign Secretary William Hague has hinted that he wants to arm Syrian rebels who are demanding President Bashar al-Assad's ouster. This week, British Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK could make its own foreign policy on supplying rebels. ""We might have to do things in our own way,"" he told lawmakers Tuesday. But Cameron stressed that the UK has not yet decided to circumvent the EU's arms embargo. ""I hope that we do not have to break from a collaborative approach across the European Union,"" he said. However, ""if we thought it was the right thing to do, we would do it."" In February, the European Union renewed its arms embargo on Syria for three months but amended it to allow greater nonlethal support and technical assistance to help protect civilians. The embargo is set to expire in May. Member countries could renew it, add amendments or veto it. U.N. Security Council concerned about Lebanon . In a united declaration, the U.N. Security Council on Thursday voiced ""grave concern over repeated incidents of cross-border fire which caused death and injury among the Lebanese population, incursions, abductions and arms trafficking across the Lebanese-Syrian border, as well as other border violations."" Members of the council -- which this month is being led by Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin -- ""expressed also their deep concern at the impact of the Syrian crisis on Lebanon's stability."" The declaration followed a briefing by officials on how the conflict in Syria has spilled into Lebanon. Besides hosting a flood of refugees -- out of the 1 million total who have moved out of Syria over the past two years, according to the U.N. refugee agency -- Lebanon has seen sporadic violence tied to the unrest. Report finds abuses by both sides . Syrian government forces continue to bomb civilians indiscriminately, while rebels increasingly resort to kidnapping and summary executions, Amnesty International said in a report. ""While the vast majority of war crimes and other gross violations continue to be committed by government forces, our research also points to an escalation in abuses by armed opposition groups,"" said Ann Harrison, deputy director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Program. The human rights organization found that in addition to bombings, government forces continue to torture and kill detainees. One researcher for the group found nine cluster bombs -- an internationally banned weapon -- in a housing estate, the report states. The unexploded bomblets are a danger to residents, especially children who might pick them up, Amnesty says. ""The Amnesty report confirms what the (opposition) has been reporting for the past two years: the Assad regime targets civilians, especially children,"" said Rafif Jouejati, a spokesman for the opposition Local Coordination Committees in Syria, or LCC. However, the report also accused the opposition of hostage taking, torture and the executions of soldiers and others it has captured. Jouejati admits there have been abuses but said no one can suggest ""by any stretch of the imagination that those abuses can be compared in scope, range, or deadliness to the regime's indiscriminate use of Scud missiles, cluster bombs, barrel bombs, and napalm."" More concern about refugees . Meanwhile, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees has called for donor nations to step up funding to help refugees fleeing Syria. Antonio Guterres warned of serious repercussions if funding is not ramped up. ""This is not just any crisis. It requires a special mechanism of support,"" he said after meeting with Jordanian officials Wednesday. Normal humanitarian aid budgets are simply not enough, he said, and if more money does not pour in, ""the consequences could be devastating for the Syrian people and for regional stability,"" he said. The death toll mounts . For all the talk, for all the concern, there's little evident change in the situation on the ground in Syria: more violence and more death. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists, documented 132 new deaths on Thursday, among them 13 children and six women. That tally includes 35 killed in what the LCC called a ""massacre committed by the regime's army"" in Hasakeh in northeast Syria. The group also reported at least 37 deaths in and around Damascus and 18 in Daraa province. The state-run Syrian Arab News Service reported that government troops ""chased members of terrorist groups"" -- its description of rebel fighters -- in one Damascus countryside community while launching ""two qualitative operations"" in other communities around the Syrian capital. SANA reported on developments in many locales elsewhere around the country, indicating government troops success in inflicting casualties and destroying enemy arms and equipment. CNN cannot independently verify death tolls or other accounts of violence in Syria. Last month, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said about 70,000 people had been killed in the conflict. CNN's Alexander Felton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","An opposition group reports 132 new deaths around Syria .

"(CNN) -- Two Kenyan presidential frontrunners are awaiting the results of a vote recount, bringing back memories of a political dynasty that dates to the 1960s. Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga are the sons of the nation's first president and vice president, respectively. Their fathers started out as allies in the quest for Kenyan independence from Britain. But their relationship ended in bad blood when founding President Jomo Kenyatta forced out his vice president, Jaramogi Odinga, following a series of disputes. About five decades later, it is the sons' turn in the spotlight. Though the two are the main players, there are a total of eight presidential contenders. Kenya elections: What you need to know .

He was born into a wealthy, powerful family and is one of Africa's richest, according to Forbes magazine. If elected, the 51-year-old would be the nation's youngest president. He lost the presidential election in 2002 to the incumbent, but has maintained his popularity. But his fame has come at a price. He is facing crimes against humanity over accusations he mobilized a tribal militia to fight in the last disputed election. He has denied the charges. Despite the International Criminal Court indictment, supporters have stood by him. His running mate, William Ruto, has also been indicted by the ICC, and both will appear at the Hague this year. A graduate of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, he is a candidate for the Jubilee Coalition. Raila Odinga . The current prime minister is a political veteran who spent years in government detention in the 1980s after a failed coup attempt. After he was freed, he went into political exile in Norway and returned to fight for democracy in 1991 at a time when elections in the nation were single party affairs. Odinga, 68, enjoys massive popularity in Kibera, the nation's largest slum, which is under his constituency. A fixture in the nation's politics for decades, the office of the prime minister was created for him in a power-sharing deal after a disputed election in 2007. He attended university in Germany, and is a candidate for the Coalition of Reforms and Democracy. Musalia Mudavadi . The second deputy prime minister has been in politics for more than two decades, and has served as a running mate to both frontrunners in previous elections. He started off as a member of parliament in 1989, and later become minister for finance. He had a short stint as the nation's vice president more than a decade ago. The 52-year-old former rugby player is a contender for the Amani Coalition. He graduated from the University of Nairobi. Martha Karua . The veteran politician's win would make her the first female president in Kenya. She was a big part of the current government, but cut ties with it four years ago when she resigned as justice minister. A former lawyer, the 55-year-old Karua has said if she doesn't win the presidency, she will retire from politics. She equates her leadership to that of a mother, and has said she will run the government like a household and not let her children go hungry. Her campaign slogan is ""Simama na Mama,"" which translates to ""Support Mom"" in Swahili. The University of Nairobi alumna is a contender for the National Rainbow Coalition-Kenya party. Other candidates: . Four others are running, including former banker Peter Kenneth, Mohammed Dida, Paul Muite and James Ole Kiyiapi.","If elected, Uhuru Kenyatta would be the nation's youngest president .

"London (CNN) -- ""Rape is not a women's issue or a humanitarian issue -- it's a global issue."" So said Hollywood star and U.N. special envoy for refugees Angelina Jolie, standing with foreign ministers from the G8 nations in London as they pledged action Thursday to end sexual violence in conflict. The Declaration on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict, endorsed by the G8 nations -- Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Britain and the United States -- commits them to taking greater steps to help the victims of sexual violence in war, prevent further attacks and hold perpetrators to account. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said the plans would help end ""the horrific use of rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war in conflicts around the globe."" He drew a parallel with the efforts made to end the global slave trade, tackle climate change and agree to an international arms trade treaty -- the last having been achieved just last week at the United Nations. ""Today we know the facts about sexual violence in conflict and we have the means to address it, so we must not look away or rest until the world faces up to its responsibilities,"" he said. Rape and serious sexual violence in conflict are grave breaches of the Geneva Convention, as well as being war crimes, Hague said. This means states have a responsibility to find those accused of such crimes and bring them to justice. Under the declaration, the G8 nations agreed to draw up protocols on international standards for the investigation of rape and sexual violence and ensuring access to justice for survivors. They will work together to raise awareness of the issue, which affects predominantly girls and women but also men and boys. They also promised to boost support services for the victims, especially children, including health care, legal aid and counseling. The agreement followed a meeting with the U.N. envoy on sexual violence in conflict, Zainab Bangura. Together, the nations pledged nearly $36 million in additional funds to help end sexual violence. Jolie, speaking alongside Hague and Bangura, said the declaration was welcome, but ""long overdue"" for the survivors of sexual violence. ""For too long, they have been the forgotten victims of war, responsible for none of the blame but bearing the worst of the pain,"" she said. ""Foreign ministers: Millions of people have been waiting for the commitments you've just made, and they will be watching to see them implemented."" Bangura told how she had recently met victims of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Somalia. In DR Congo, she visited a community where, last year, 11 babies aged between 6 and 12 months were raped, she said. ""Faced with such horror, we are compelled to turn the despair in our hearts into unshakeable resolve that this will not happen to our children,"" she said. This means ending a culture of impunity for those responsible -- and the governments of the countries where such sexual violence occurs must be part of the solution, she said. ""We have an opportunity like at no time before in history to break the back of this age-old evil,"" she said. ""Sexual violence in conflict is not inevitable, and preventing it is not impossible.""","G8 foreign ministers endorse a declaration to end sexual violence in war .

"Dunlap, California (CNN) -- Even if his daughter was fearless, Paul Hanson was not. He supported Dianna's lifelong love of big cats, as well as her single-minded mission to work with them. Yet despite her assurances, he worried. His nightmare came true Wednesday, when a 350-pound African lion killed Dianna Hanson at Project Survival's Cat Haven in Dunlap, California, where she was working as an intern. ""I always had a premonition that someday I would get a call like this,"" her father said Thursday. ""But I just thought it would be much further in the future than 24."" That's how old the Seattle native was when the lion opened the gate of a pen at the big cat sanctuary, then moved into a larger enclosure, according to the local coroner. Dianna Hanson was cleaning the enclosure the two lions had been in not long before, Fresno County coroner Dr. David Hadden said, citing investigators. Somehow, one of those animals -- a 5-year-old lion named Cous Cous -- escaped and attacked her. Watch video of the lion from 2012 . ""(Hanson) died very quickly and did not suffer,"" Hadden said. A preliminary autopsy showed Hanson died of a ""broken neck and other neck injuries,"" according to the coroner. The animal inflicted other injuries ""post-mortem."" Paul Hanson,told CNN's Erin Burnett he had been told that his daughter wasn't mauled, saying she had no blood, ""no rips or gashes."" He and his family are grieving, taking comfort in the fact that Dianna Hanson died doing what she loved -- taking care of big cats such as Cous Cous. Looking back at photos Dianna had posted on Facebook over the past two months, when she'd begun working at the expansive northern California facility, Paul Hanson said he and his wife agreed that this was the happiest they'd ever seen her. ""And that's the only way I can bear this,"" he said. ""Because this was her dream. She was living her dream."" Death devastates those at big cat sanctuary . When she was 6 or 7, Dianna Hanson was convinced she'd someday go to Siberia to study Siberian snow tigers. Her obsession with them and, eventually, other big cats never left her, according to her father. Her first hands-on experience with such animals came while a student at Western Washington University in Bellingham, where she helped take care of lions and tigers owned by a family there. The six-month internship at Cat Haven was her big break -- her ticket, she hoped, to getting a full-time job at a zoo. Paul Hanson said that his daughter was impressed with everything about what she considered ""a very safe, well-run place"" where the animals got far more room to roam than at most zoos. ""She was just really impressed with the way it was laid out and organized,"" he said. ""There was never any question of safety in her mind or any mismanagement."" Cat Haven's founder, Dale Anderson, said the facility has been ""incident-free"" since it opened in 1998. And Dianna Hanson quickly became part of the ""family,"" lightening the load and brightening the mood wherever she went, recalled the non-profit's president, Wendy Debbas. She gave the animals songs -- for a jaguar named Samba it was ""La Samba,"" to the tune of ""La Bamba,"" while another named Rose had ""Kissed by a Rose."" ""She made instant friendships with everybody up here,"" Debbas said. ""Everybody loved her."" They don't -- at least now, at least publicly -- have an explanation as to what happened to her. The Fresno County Sheriff's Office said that when the lion attacked, another employee at the sanctuary tried to distract him away from Hanson and move him into another enclosure. ""But all attempts failed,"" the office said. A sheriff's deputy shot and killed the animal to reach Hanson and give her medical assistance. However, it was too late. ""Our whole staff is ... it's just, it's devastating,"" Anderson said Thursday, choking back tears. 'They are wild animals, end of story' The autopsy finding on Hanson will be reviewed by a veterinarian at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which is conducting the necropsy on the lion. ""Fish and Wildlife has trained our officers in California to recognize a lion kill due to our abundance of mountain lions,"" Hadden said, noting that the coordination between the two camps follows a protocol set up in case of a mountain lion attack. ""We never in our wildest imagination thought it would be an African lion."" Fatal lion maulings are rare in the United States, though not unprecedented. Twenty people, including five children, have been killed by big cats in the United States in the past 21 years, according to figures kept by Big Cat Rescue, a nonprofit cat sanctuary in Tampa, Florida. Another 246 people were mauled in the United States during that same time period, 1990 to 2011, the group said. Leopard killed after mauling six in India . The attacking lion, Cous Cous, was one of Dianna Hanson's favorites, according to her father. The lion was also a celebrity of sorts, having appeared on Ellen DeGeneres' television show when he was about 3 months old. That said, noted animal expert Jack Hanna said any big cat can be unpredictable in the way it reacts to what it sees or hears. ""They are wild animals, end of story,"" he said. ""No matter what anyone says, they are wild animals."" CNN's Ted Rowlands reported from California, Cristy Lenz reported from Atlanta, and Greg Botelho wrote the story. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","NEW: Victim's father says he had ""premonition ... I would get a call like this,"" just not so soon .

"(CNN) -- It is the dark side of paradise, a tale of torture and murder. And this week, it plays out in a picturesque courthouse a few yards from the sun-kissed beaches of St. Maarten. The trial of the three men charged with killing Michael and Thelma King begins Tuesday. The defendants, who face a possible life sentence in prison if convicted, are accused of stabbing the South Carolina couple to death in a crime that has made headlines in the Caribbean and across America. Michael's brother, Todd King, told CNN that he and his family will attend the trial. ""Everybody's coming,"" he said while remembering the two lives that were brutally taken. ""Everybody loved Michael, he was just one of the nicest guys you would ever meet,"" he said. ""And Thelma walked on water, as far as our family was concerned. She was just like a sister."" Michael, who was 53, and Thelma, 57, loved St. Maarten, Todd said. They resided here for several months during the year and planned to invest in a local business. The Kings owned a condominium at the Ocean Club Resort in an area known as Cupecoy. They were killed in their beachfront apartment, and their bodies were discovered on September 21. Solicitor General Taco Stein told CNN the couple was slain in a home invasion. ""As far as we have been able to establish, theft is the motive,"" Stein said. ""So it's a robbery that went out of hand into murder."" The victims were repeatedly stabbed, according to local officials. Thelma King was tied to a chair, Stein said. The suspects, who have been identified by their initials, are J.J.W, who was arrested on St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands; J.C.M, who is 17; and M.K.J., 28, who Stein said confessed to his involvement in the killings. The trial is expected to last two days, with the judge issuing a ruling in early May. ""I'm confident they will be found guilty,"" Stein said. Brenda Brooks, the attorney who represents J.C.M., expressed doubts about the prosecution's theory of the case. ""I don't believe it,"" Brooks said, ""that these guys kind of went on a joyride with someone else's car, and then went out drinking and ended up coincidentally by the Kings, and it was initially said to be a robbery and they end up killing the couple. ""I think there is something else to that story. From the moment I heard it I said it doesn't add up."" The double homicide and the upcoming trial have generated widespread attention and safety concerns for the hundreds of thousands of tourists who vacation on the island each year. Stein said violent crimes like this are exceedingly rare. ""Murders do take place, let's face it,"" he said, ""but this hasn't happened before."" ""The Kings were liked on the island. They came here often. The island is shocked."" The couple had many friends, both on St. Maarten and at home in South Carolina. ""They were the greatest people in the world,"" said Terry Tamblyn, who knew the Kings for 25 years. ""Michael would give you the shirt off his back,"" he said. ""It was a senseless killing."" Bodies of couple are handed over to relatives .","The bodies of Michael and Thelma King were found in their apartment in September .

Increasingly rare, polyandry has been predominantly practised in Asia, specifically in the Himalayan region.

It is also thought to have been practised in some Polynesian communities.

"(CNN) -- Roger Ebert got a final ""thumbs up"" as family, friends and filmmakers eulogized the movie critic at his funeral in Chicago on Monday. Hundreds gathered inside Chicago's Holy Name Cathedral, but many more watched the live telecast of the service carried by local stations and streamed online. It is a production his widow, Chaz Ebert, said would get a good review from the late critic. ""He would have loved this,"" she said. ""He would love the majesty of it, he would love everything about it, he would love that you were all here for him, he would have loved everything the priests did."" Although he's known for reviewing films, his widow spoke about his passion for social justice. ""He really was a soldier for social justice, and it didn't matter to him your race, creed, color, level of ability, sexual orientation -- he had a heart big enough to love and accept all,"" she said. Fellow critic Richard Roeper served as one of the pallbearers, carrying Ebert's casket into the cathedral, where dignitaries waited, including Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. ""He was the most American of American critics in the most American of American cities,"" Emanuel said in his eulogy. ""It was in Chicago where Roger kept his home, where he kept his heart and where he found his inspiration."" On Twitter, Roger Ebert found a new voice . Ebert reviewed movies for the Chicago Sun Times starting in 1967, leading to success with his syndicated column and iconic television show ""Siskel and Ebert At The Movies"" ""He didn't just dominate his profession, he defined it,"" Emanuel said. ""LIke generations of Chicagoans, before I went to a movie I needed to find out two things: What time does it start and what does Roger think about it? Roger spent a lot of his time sitting through bad movies so that we didn't have to. No good movie is too long and no bad movie is too short, he wrote."" Ebert died last Thursday after a long batter with cancer. ""Life was too short for Roger to be defeated by illness, so when Roger's body became weak, we saw how his mind become sharper,"" Emanuel said. ""Roger did not chose cancer. He did chose his response to it: To keep living. Rather than allow his struggle to separate himself from his readers, it became another way for Roger to relate to us. With every one of his reviews, his TV appearances, his tweets, Roger shared with us one lesson: Life is too short not to be shared with others."" Ebert's last year was his most productive with 306 movie reviews, compared to the normal 200 a year. ""His time with us was too short, but what he shared with us endures,"" Emanuel said. ""The final reel of Roger's life may have run to the end, but his memory will never fade."" Great movies and terrible bombs, according to Roger Ebert . Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn said Ebert was ""a populist who understood that it's the duty of all of us to take good care of those who don't have a champion."" ""We love you Roger, we always will. Thumbs up!"" Gov. Quinn said at the end. Jonathan Jackson, son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sr., spoke about the impact Ebert's reviews of black-directed films such as Spike Lee's ""School Daze"" and ""Do the Right Thing"" had on society. ""I look at Roger as a soldier with a pen when he sat on a high perch and gave a commentary and opinion that depicted us as human, that showed us as normal in 'School Daze,' "" Jackson said. ""He saw young black children not as problems, but as people."" Jackson also read a message from Spike Lee: ""Roger Ebert was a champion of my work and other black filmmakers at a critical time in American cinema history, Roger was one of the lone defenders of 'Do the Right Thing' when everybody else and their mothers were saying that black folks would run amok and riot during the summer of 1989. Roger fought the good fight. Roger fought the power."" Opinion: Ebert's sheer love of life . Former Chicago Sun Times Editor John Barron, who was Ebert's boss for many years, said Ebert understood the changing newspaper business. ""Roger was pretty much the first with a computer,"" Barron said. ""He was the first with e-mail. He opened up whole new worlds with his blog and his Twitter account. Roger was 24-7 before anyone had even thought about that term. While we were all still focused on making the nightly deadline, Roger was showing us what a fully evolved newspaper man look liked. He taught us a lot and we at the Sun Times were always proud to say we worked where Roger Ebert worked. The glow that he cast was warm and wide."" Ebert's stepdaughter Sonia Evans spoke about Ebert the father. ""He's the man whom we deeply loved -- kind sincere warm, loving, intelligent, imaginative, transformative and just a world-class human being who exercised his gift for the world."" ""I'm the happiest when I think of how he and my mother found each other,"" she said. Appreciation for Ebert, the everyman's movie critic .","""He would have loved this,"" Ebert's widow says at his funeral .

"(CNN) -- Wildfires, tornadoes, snow, ice, flooding, all on the same day. Sure, it sounds weird. But it's not, CNN meteorologist Judson Jones said Tuesday. ""It's just spring,"" he said. ""Blinding snow and 40 degrees below average does not sound like spring in Denver. On the flip side, the 20 degrees above average forecast for New York City feels more like early summer,"" he said. ""But the unexpected is what we expect in spring."" A day after bizarre weather on Monday in which emergency workers northeast of Denver responded to a wildfire, a possible tornado and a blizzard warning -- all within a 50-mile radius -- a storm pouring over the Rockies gave Denver students a rare snow day on Tuesday. It also caused the cancellation of at least 486 flights at Denver International Airport. In South Dakota, which was on the lookout for up to 11 inches of snow on Tuesday, nearly four-tenths of an inch of ice had been recorded near Sioux Falls, with more on the way, the National Weather Service reported. ""It was 65 all last week!"" CNN iReporter Nathan Zacher said. ""Normally around 55 degrees this time of year."" The ice was downing trees and making travel tough, he said. And while the Southeast and parts of the Northeast basked in sunny warmth, residents of the Central Plains braced for the possibility of severe storms, including tornadoes. Central Oklahoma and parts of north central Texas were under moderate threat of severe thunderstorms, including the possibility of tornadoes, through Tuesday night, Jones said. About 2.6 million people live in the path of those storms, which includes Oklahoma City and Tulsa in Oklahoma and Wichita Falls in Texas, Jones said. The primary threat from those storms will be large hail, the National Weather Service said. Half-dollar-size hail was reported in Hamilton County, Iowa, and hail covered the ground in Fullerton, Nebraska. In Denver on Tuesday, schools were closed, despite grumblings from parents online that there would be too little snow to keep kids home. In a posting on its website, the district said Monday night that it made the call because it could be too hazardous to put kids on buses in what were expected to be icy, low-visibility conditions Tuesday morning. At Denver International Airport, the staff said on Twitter that crews were continuing to clear snow and ice from runways and about half the canceled flights were commuter flights to smaller Rocky Mountain towns. Weather tracker . Monday Weather . Those actions followed a busy day in Colorado, where the storm knocked out power to about half the small town of Akron, destroyed a mobile home and damaged two other structures, at least one of which was a home, the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said. No serious injuries were reported. While it was not immediately clear if the winds in that storm were from a tornado, a tornado did briefly touch down near Bonny Lake in eastern Colorado on Monday, the National Weather Service reported. Colorado crews also worked a 2,600-acre wildfire in Sterling County. Colorado has long been in a drought, and it wouldn't take much to spark a fire there, Jones said. Wet, wet, wet . Inclement weather is not limited to the snow and ice. The National Weather Service said to expect ""a plethora of interesting weather conditions."" Flood watches and warnings are in effect for most of Wisconsin on Tuesday, to be followed by freezing rain later in the week. ""Severe thunderstorms and even isolated tornadoes are possible across the central and southern Plains to the mid and lower Mississippi Valley,"" the weather service said. By Wednesday, a squall line stretching from Memphis down through Louisiana should roll eastward through the Deep South, pushing along heavy thunderstorms, hail, damaging winds and possibly short-lived tornadoes, forecasters said. It will be unseasonably warm in the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, the weather service predicts. It's not all bad . Most of the country will see rain for the better part of the week. That's good news for the Plains and mountain states, which have seen extreme to exceptional drought for months. The snow in the mountain states will extend the fun for winter sport fans, according Coloradoski.com. As ski season winds down, with about half of resorts already closed, some popular slopes are expecting 1 to 5 inches of fresh powder through Wednesday. The same goes for resorts in Utah.

"New York (CNN) -- Severe weather barreled across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Saturday as a powerful cold front brought heavy rain, high winds and at least one tornado into a beachfront neighborhood of New York City. A waterspout with winds up to 70 mph churned onshore and turned into a tornado toward Breezy Point, officials said, a Queens neighborhood on the western edge of the Rockaway peninsula. Amateur video captured images of the twister spiraling a mixture of sand and debris, which was largely flung onto a nearby baseball field, according to Ross Dickman, a National Weather Service spokesman. Are you there? Send your photos and videos, but stay safe. The funnel churned about 600 yards inland before dissipating, Dickman said. But it still had enough power to knock down trees and power lines, causing minor structural damage to nearby buildings. iReporter: 'I knew a tornado was coming' A New York fire department official, who declined to be named citing official policy, said fire units deployed to the Breezy Point area in response to reports of overturned cars, broken windows and roof damage. ""It just got real windy and dark,"" said Juliana Santiago, who works at the Silver Gull Beach Club. Roughly half a mile away, the Breezy Point Surf Club was damaged and closed after storms knocked out the power, said Santiago. ""I heard a big wind and heard a snapping of a utility pole,"" said Jim Brady, who said he watched as the storms rolled in at Breezy Point. ""It literally looked like the Wizard of Oz,"" said Jim Brady, a fellow witness. A second confirmed tornado touched down in Brooklyn, another New York City borough, around 11:30 a.m., according to the weather service. This twister was about 50 yards wide as it traveled a half mile in Canarsie, about 9 miles north of the other reported tornado. iReporter records flooding in Brooklyn neighborhood . No one was killed or injured as a result of the Brooklyn tornado, which had 110 mph winds -- meaning it is categorized as a strong EF1, on a scale from EF0 to the most powerful EF5.

The harsh weather forced U.S. Open men's and women's singles tennis matches in Flushing Meadows, in the New York City borough of Queens, to be rescheduled to Sunday.

"(CNN) -- A Colorado judge ruled Thursday that probable cause exists in the case of James Holmes, accused of killing 12 people and wounding scores more in last summer's shooting inside an Aurora movie theater, and ordered that he stand trial. Arapahoe County District Judge William Blair Sylvester, who ordered that Holmes be held without bail, converted a status hearing scheduled for Friday to an arraignment. In his 61-page ruling, Sylvester said the prosecution had established probable cause in all 166 counts, including first-degree murder. A defense request for a continuance of the arraignment will be taken up Friday, a court administrator said. The 25-year-old former doctoral student in neuroscience at the University of Colorado, Denver, faces 166 charges, including murder, attempted murder and weapons offenses, tied to the July 20 rampage during a screening of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Rises."" Sylvester's decision came after a three-day hearing this week in which prosecutors presented evidence against Holmes. ""He didn't care who he killed,"" prosecutor Karen Pearson told the judge at the conclusion of her case against Holmes, saying he chose his venue carefully to cage his victims. ""He intended to kill them all."" Read more: New details emerge at hearing . The shootings killed 12 and wounded 58. Defense attorneys, who had been expected to call witnesses and argue a diminished capacity defense, changed their minds during the hearing, attorney Dan King said. ""We have had a change of position,"" he said. ""This is neither the proper venue nor the time to put on a show or present some truncated defense."" Diminished capacity relates to a person's ability or inability ""to make adequately considered decisions"" regarding his or her legal representation because of ""mental impairment or for some other reason,"" the Colorado Bar Assocation says. That differs from an insanity defense, which refers to ""a person who is so diseased or defective in mind at the time of the commission of the act as to be incapable of distinguishing right from wrong with respect to that act is not accountable,"" the bar association says. The bar association adds ""that care should be taken not to confuse such mental disease or defect with moral obliquity, mental depravity, or passion growing out of anger, revenge, hatred, or other motives and kindred evil conditions, for, when the act is induced by any of these causes, the person is accountable to the law."" After the hearing, some of the victims' relatives asserted that Holmes was too calculating to be afflicted with diminished capacity. ""He's not crazy one bit,"" Tom Teves told reporters Wednesday. His son Alex, 24, was among those killed. ""He's very, very cold. He's very, very calculated,"" Teves said of Holmes. ""He has a brain set that no one here can understand, and we want to call him crazy because we want to make that feel better in our society. ""But we have to accept the fact there is evil people in our society that enjoy killing any type of living thing. That doesn't make him crazy,"" Teves said. Added Jessica Watts, cousin of Jonathan Blunk, also killed in the theater: ""It was complete planning. It was competency. It was everything on his part to make sure that this act was carried out from start to finish."" According to hearing testimony, here is what is known about his alleged preparations: . Getting ready . Holmes began buying guns in May, supervisory agent Steve Beggs of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives testified on Tuesday. Beggs said Holmes built an arsenal of two Glock handguns, an AR-15 rifle, a shotgun and 6,295 rounds of ammunition. Among other purchases, Beggs said Holmes bought two 6-ounce tear gas grenades over the Internet on May 10 and he went to a gun store on May 22 to buy one of his Glocks. A little more than a month later, on July 1, a video camera captured Holmes as he bought a scope, a mount and some inert ammunition at a Colorado gun store, Beggs said. In the video, Beggs said, Holmes' hair is dyed bright orange. A police detective testified that Holmes apparently visited the cinema and took photographs of hallways and doors several times before the shootings. The photographs were recovered from Holmes' cell phone and go along with months of sales records and descriptions of meticulously prepared booby traps at his home. It all helps illustrate what would appear to be a well-planned attack. On July 7, Holmes used an online ticketing service to buy a ticket for the midnight showing of the movie, according to Detective Craig Appel, the lead investigator in the case. Read more: Remembering the victims . The apartment . Witnesses detailed preparations that prosecutors believe Holmes made before setting out for the theater to turn his sparsely decorated Aurora apartment into a deathtrap. At least some of the preparations were well under way by July 16, based on a photograph from Holmes' phone shown by prosecutors. In it, jars, wires, firework shells and other bomb-making materials are laid out in his kitchen. By the time Holmes left, the carpet in his apartment had been soaked in oil and gas, FBI bomb technician Garrett Gumbinner testified. A container of glycerin hung above a frying pan with a potassium mixture, attached to a trip wire that would tip the glycerin into the pan, Gumbinner testified. Had it been triggered, Gumbinner said, it would have set off an explosion and fire, igniting jars of homemade napalm spiked with bullets and thermite -- a metallic substance that burns so hot it is nearly impossible to extinguish. In a twist that seems ripped from the pages of a comic book, Holmes also rigged his computer and a boom box placed outside to begin playing loud music after he set out for the theater -- apparently in hopes that the noise would prompt someone to investigate and trigger the explosives, witnesses said. Next to the boom box outside his apartment, Gumbinner testified, Holmes said he placed a toy car and a device that looked like it would control the car but would instead have set off the explosives. Authorities said they recovered the boom box, which bore Holmes' fingerprints. The remote-control car device was never found, Appel testified. A series of self-portraits displayed in court, apparently made before Holmes allegedly left for the theater, according to data retrieved from his phone, show him in eye-blackening contacts, his tongue stuck out in one, flashing a toothy grin and a handgun in another. The shooting . Video from the theater shows a man they say is Holmes -- wearing dark pants, a light-colored shirt and a dark stocking cap covering his orange hair -- entering the multiplex before the movie begins. The recordings show him going into Theater No. 9, a different theater from the one listed on his ticket. Sources have said they believe he propped open the theater's back door and went to his car to put on body armor and arm himself. Authorities believe Holmes then re-entered the theater, tossing gas canisters before opening fire about 18 minutes into the movie, according to sources. Witnesses who have spoken to CNN about the shooting have said the gunman roamed the theater, shooting randomly as people tried to scramble away or cowered between seats. Aurora survivors: How they're doing . Among the 41 calls to 911, one stands out. In the 27-second call, at least 30 shots can be heard amid the chaos. At some point, according to Pearson, one of Holmes' weapons jammed. ""Had the AR-15 not jammed, he would have killed more people,"" she said. Investigators found 76 shell casings in the auditorium. Most of the spent rounds -- 65 -- were .223 caliber rifle rounds, six were shotgun shells and five were .40 caliber rounds from the Glocks, Appel said. Police also found one of the tear-gas canisters inside the theater, Appel said. Also located was a large drum magazine for the rifle that appeared to have jammed, Sgt. Gerald Jonsgaard testified Monday. Outside, the first officer to encounter Holmes -- who was dressed in body armor, a helmet and a gas mask as he stood near his car -- described him as unnaturally relaxed. In fact, from Holmes' appearance, Officer Jason Oviatt thought he was a fellow police officer. A trail of blood led from the theater. The rifle that authorities say Holmes used in the attack lay on the ground near the building. Holmes was just standing there, Oviatt testified Monday. ""He seemed very detached from it all,"" Oviatt said. Holmes, sweating and smelly, his pupils dilated, didn't struggle or even tense his muscles as he was dragged away to be searched, Oviatt said. Police would cut off the body armor he wore and learn about the explosive booby-trap at his home. The interrogation . Police described a strange scene in the interrogation room -- Holmes sitting in his underwear, T-shirt and white socks after police had cut away his body armor -- making puppets of the paper bags officers had placed over his hands to preserve gunpowder evidence, according to Appel. Holmes played with his polystyrene drinking cup as if it were a piece in a game. Appel said. Then he removed a staple from the table and tried to stick it in an electrical outlet, the detective testified. Asked by a defense attorney whether he had ordered a blood test for Holmes, Appel said he had not. ""There were no indications that he was under the influence of anything,"" he said.

"(EW.com) -- The 2013 box office has been stuck in a bit of a rut. For nine of the past ten weekends, overall grosses have lagged behind 2012 totals, and high-profile releases like ""Jack the Giant Slayer,"" ""The Host,"" ""Beautiful Creatures,"" and ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" have badly misfired. That's why industry folks are likely breathing a sigh of relief this morning looking at the box office chart. Not only did ""Evil Dead"" and ""Jurassic Park 3D"" both open successfully, but six separate films earned over $10 million during the Friday-to-Sunday period. It's an encouraging sign of industry health as Hollywood gears up for the lucrative summer movie season. ""Evil Dead,"" a new remake of Sam Raimi's 1981 cult classic, led the way with $24.2 million. Sony is boasting a $26 million frame, which includes the $1.8 million the film earned at Thursday night shows. The horror film scared up more in its opening weekend than ""Texas Chainsaw 3D,"" which debuted to $21.7 million in January, but less than ""Mama,"" which took of with $28.4 million in February. Although ""Evil Dead"" is already a big winner for TriStar, FilmDistrict, and Ghost House Pictures, which made it for just $17 million, the film will have limited longevity in the weeks to come, as evidenced by its frontloaded performance thus far. ""Evil Dead"" dropped 15 percent from Friday ($10.1 million) to Saturday ($8.8 million), and a weak ""C+"" CinemaScore suggests the film isn't connecting with audiences outside its core horror-junkie demographic. ""Evil Dead"" could return to the grave with about $50 million when all is said and done. The film's success must be gratifying for Sam Raimi, who directed the original and has his own picture in the Top 10 this week — ""Oz The Great and Powerful"" finished in seventh place with $8.2 million and has now earned $454.1 million worldwide. 'SNL': Melissa McCarthy does it again . Fox's $135 million animated hit ""The Croods"" continued to benefit from being the only family release in theaters right now. The cave people comedy dropped 21 percent in its third weekend to $21.1 million, giving it a $125.8 million total and lots of time to continue evolving. The Croods will easily surpass the domestic totals of Fox's most recent animated efforts, ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" ($161.3 million) and Rio ($143.6 million), and if it maintains its slim week-to-week drops, it should finish close to $200 million. Internationally, the film has already passed that mark with $206.8 million — $34.1 million of which came from this weekend. High-octane sequel ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" tied ""The Croods"" for second place with $21.1 million — when studios report final numbers tomorrow, the exact rankings will be clarified. ""Retaliation"" fell 48 percent from its first weekend and has now commanded $86.7 million after 11 days. At the same point in its run, predecessor ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" had earned $101.2 million, and the sequel will almost certainly fall short of ""Cobra's"" $150.2 million domestic total. Fortunately, Retaliation, which comes from studios Paramount, MGM, and Skydance, is making up ground internationally, where it has earned $145.2 million after only two weekends (""Cobra's"" overseas total was $152.3 million), giving it $231.8 million globally. Miranda Lambert wins ACM, salutes Carrie . For star Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who assumed the lead role in the ""G.I. Joe"" franchise, ""Retaliation"" is kicking off what's sure to be an impressive few months of his box office career. On April 26, his Mark Wahlberg action-collab ""Pain and Gain"" hits theaters, and on May 24, surefire smash Fast & Furious 6 will race to profitability. Do you smell what The Rock is cooking? Hits! (Ok, with the exception of Snitch, which only earned $41.8 million earlier this year.) Universal's re-release ""Jurassic Park 3D,"" the latest entry in the 3-D re-release fad kickstarted by ""The Lion King"" 3D's $94.1 million haul in 2011, stomped away with $18.2 million in its first weekend. IMAX screens accounted for $6 million of that figure. The dinosaur film (read a wonderful oral history of it HERE) had better start than Titanic 3D, which debuted to $17.3 million, but behind Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace 3D, which opened with $22.4 million. All told, the Steven Spielberg classic might score about $50 -- 60 million, a tremendous result considering it only cost Universal $10 million to convert to 3D. Lisa Vanderpump faints during 'DWTS' prep . The presidential thriller ""Olympus Has Fallen"" snuck past Tyler Perry's ""Temptation"" to take fifth place, though both films earned about $10 million for the weekend. Olympus dipped only 29 percent in its third weekend, giving it a $71.1 million total against a $70 million budget. The White House action flick has proven to be a nice performer for star Gerard Butler, who was coming off a string of flops, as well as distributor FilmDistrict. Olympus has surpassed Insidious ($54 million total) as the young studio's biggest hit. Lionsgate's Temptation, meanwhile, stumbled 54 percent to $10 million, giving it a nice ten-day total of $38.3 million versus a $20 million budget. 1. Evil Dead -- $24.2 million . 2. The Croods -- $21.1 million . 2. G.I. Joe: Retaliation -- $21 million . 4. Jurassic Park-- $18.2 million . 5. Olympus Has Fallen -- $10 million . 6. Tyler Perry's Temptation -- $10 million . In limited release, the Bradley Cooper/Ryan Gosling drama ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" continued to excel. This weekend, the film expanded from four to 30 theaters, where it earned $695,000, giving it another scorching location average of $23,167. Focus Features plans to keep rolling out the $15 million film in the weeks to come. Danny Boyle's ""Trance"" also opened in four theaters this weekend, and earned encouraging results. The film, which stars Rosario Dawson, earned $136,000 — yielding a per theater average of $36,000. Fox Searchlight plans to expand the film into 375-400 locations next weekend.

"(CNN) -- North Korea's state news agency reported Friday that the country's Internet servers are subject to daily ""intensive and persistent virus attacks"" that the government blames on ""hostile forces"" including the United States. ""It is nobody's secret that the U.S. and the South Korean puppet regime are massively bolstering up cyberforces in a bid to intensify the subversive activities and sabotages against the DPRK,"" according to the official KCNA report. ""... They are seriously mistaken if they think they can quell the DPRK's voices of justice through such base acts. The U.S. and its allies should be held wholly accountable for the ensuing consequences."" North Korea has been under intense international pressure since its third nuclear test earlier this year, which spurred the U.N. Security Council to approve tough new sanctions. Pyongyang threatened a possible ""pre-emptive nuclear attack"" earlier this month, and the official news agency reeled off agreements with South Korea that it said would no longer apply. Among them are its non-agression pacts with the South, which helped bring the Korean War to a close in 1953. Official: Cyberattacks, North Korea, jihadists groups top U.S. threats . Experts on the region and U.S. officials said the recent frenzy of ominous language from North Korea under its leader Kim Jong Un makes the situation on the Korean Peninsula more worrying and unpredictable. On Tuesday, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified to Congress that North Korea's development of a nuclear weapons program poses a ""serious threat."" While calling the developments ""disturbing,"" KCNA's report Friday did not specify what damage -- if any -- the alleged cyberattacks had done in North Korea. It promised that Pyongyang ""will never remain a passive onlooker,"" though it didn't indicate what the country might do about any cyberattack. U.S. Army Gen. James Thurman, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said last spring that North Korea had its own ""growing cyberwarfare capability.""

"Kaufman, Texas (CNN) -- As friends and family attended a private funeral for a Texas prosecutor and his wife who were gunned down in their Kaufman County home, investigators on Friday announced the arrest of a man accused of threatening the safety of a deputy district attorney. The news came after word that police were searching for a person who called in a bomb threat during the visitation Thursday night for Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, at a church in Wortham.The call was made about 6:30 p.m. after the bodies were returned to the church from a public memorial service in Sunnyvale. The news of the arrest and the bomb threat come as federal, state and local authorities search for suspects in the unsolved killings of the county's district attorney and his chief felony prosecutor, who was killed almost two months earlier. The McLellands' bodies were discovered on March 30 at their home, almost exactly two months after McLelland's chief felony prosecutor, Mark Hasse, was killed in a daytime shooting outside the county courthouse. Authorities have been working to determine whether the killings of McLelland and Hasse are connected, scouring their case files and interviewing colleagues for help with potential leads. A day before his body was discovered, McLelland voiced concern about the safety of his staff when he stopped by Helz Firearms, a local gun shop. ""He was in there ... asking about what he should get his co-workers as self-protection,"" said O'Neil Kidwill, the gun shop owner. ""I recommended the 38 Smith & Wesson snub nose and perhaps a bulletproof vest. He said he already talked to some of the people about the vest, and he would tell them about the revolvers."" The 63-year-old county district attorney didn't give any indication that he felt personally threatened, only worried for his employees. ""He was concerned for them. For himself, he was at ease,"" Kidwell said. But sometime after he left the gun shop, something happened. The couple's bodies were found inside their home in Kaufman County. They had been shot at least a dozen times, a law enforcement official, who had been briefed on the investigation, told CNN this week. The official was not authorized to publicly release details of the investigation. While authorities have not publicly named any suspects or a potential motive in the cases, Kaufman sheriff's deputies arrested two men this week and accused them of threatening the safety of public officials. On Friday, the sheriff's office said it charged Robert Alan Miller, 52, of Terrell, Texas, with one count of making a terroristic threat. Officials said he threatened a deputy district attorney in a posting on a news website. Miller, who was arrested Thursday, is being held at the Kaufman County Jail on $1 million bail, according to the sheriff's office. Earlier, authorities arrested Nick Morale, 56, on one charge of making a terroristic threat after he allegedly threatened a county official. An arrest affidavit alleges that Morale called the county's Crime Stoppers tip line on Monday afternoon, saying a county official ""would be the next victim."" Authorities said there is nothing to link Miller or Morale to the killing of the McLellands or Hasse. They have declined to release the names of those who were threatened.

"(CNN) -- A powerful storm that swept across the country this week was on its way to the North Atlantic on Friday, leaving rain, snow and at least four deaths in its wake. At one point, the line of storms stretched from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. It dumped snow in the north-central and northeastern United States and torrential rain in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys, and brought tornadoes in the Deep South. Four people were killed in separate incidents in Missouri, Mississippi and Nebraska. A woman froze to death after her car broke down near Berea, Nebraska, when a blizzard struck Monday, state police said. Her son survived, but suffered frostbite and hypothermia, and was at a local hospital. An employee for Ameren Missouri was electrocuted Thursday while attempting to restore power after storms, the company said. In Mississippi, one person died when a tornado destroyed a steel building along a highway in Kemper County, on the Alabama border, on Thursday, the National Weather Service said. It rated the storm an EF3, meaning the tornado had winds of between 136 and 165 mph and was capable of severe damage. A 34-year-old woman from Oxford, Mississippi, was killed when the vehicle she was driving apparently hydroplaned, then overturned several times, the state highway patrol said. Her passenger was injuried but survived. Another five people were hurt in the storms across Mississippi, state emergency management agency said. At least seven counties in Mississippi and four in Alabama suffered damage, officials said. Georgia's emergency management agency reported trees down in several counties Thursday night. A weak tornado snapped large limbs and caused power outages around Slidell on Louisiana's Gulf coast, according to the National Weather Service. Watch as tornado approaches . Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency after storms pummeled the St. Louis area and other parts of the state Wednesday night. The National Weather Service said an EF2 tornado, with winds of between 111 and 135 mph, was responsible for damage to more than 100 homes, according to the governor's website. Arkansas also was hard hit, prompting Gov. Mike Beebe to declare 15 counties state disaster areas.

"Peosta, Iowa (CNN) -- President Barack Obama placed the blame for Washington's current political paralysis squarely at the feet of his Republican opponents Tuesday, telling CNN that the GOP's ""ideological rigidity"" is standing in the way of compromises necessary for stronger economic growth. In a wide-ranging interview with Wolf Blitzer, the president said the inability of GOP leaders in Congress to support a recent $4 trillion deficit reduction deal focused more heavily on spending cuts than revenue increases is evidence of a party placing political considerations before national interests. Americans want to see ""Democrats and Republicans putting country before party,"" he said. ""The fact that Speaker (John) Boehner and folks in his caucus couldn't say yes to that (deficit deal) tells me that they're more interested in the politics ... than they are in solving the problem."" Obama's interview on the campus of Northeast Iowa Community College was conducted in the midst of a three-day presidential swing through the politically pivotal Midwest, a region believed to be critical in determining the outcome of the 2012 campaign. The discussion touched on a host of domestic and international topics, though the president noted the importance of the fragile economy heading into next year's election. ""Ultimately, the buck stops with me. I'm going to be accountable,"" Obama said. But the president was quick to emphasize the ""mess"" he inherited from former President George W. Bush in 2009. He also stressed the economic drag created by state and local government layoffs, as well as ""headwinds"" from Europe's debt crisis, a tsunami-ravaged Japan and higher gas prices resulting from the Arab Spring. ""We've made progress since the start of this recession back in 2008. (But) it hasn't been fast enough. We've got to accelerate it,"" Obama said. The president stressed that he is ""going to need a partner"" in Congress -- now partially controlled by the Republicans -- in order to pass legislation needed to strengthen the economy in the short term. Obama renewed his call for an extension of payroll tax cuts as well as some business tax breaks. He also urged Congress to pass stalled trade deals with Panama, South Korea and Colombia. He noted his intention to unveil new job growth legislation for senators and representatives to consider once they return from their summer recess after Labor Day. ""I'm going to make my best case for where we need to go"" as a country and make ""one more run at Congress,"" he said. The president was largely dismissive of the Republican presidential field, claiming he was not thinking about it too much at the moment. ""I'll let (the Republicans) winnow it down a little bit,"" he said. But once the GOP chooses a presidential standard-bearer for 2012, ""I'll be ready for them,"" the president promised. Asked to respond to Texas Gov. Rick Perry's assertion that members of the armed services would prefer a commander in chief who has served in the military, Obama said presidential candidates have ""got to be a little more careful"" about what they say. But as Perry had just entered the race over the weekend, Obama said, he will ""cut (Perry) some slack"" for the moment. Regarding former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's remarks that ""corporations are people,"" Obama conceded that corporations play a critical role in the generation of wealth. He stressed his disagreement with some conservatives, however, over the closure of tax loopholes benefiting certain major corporations. ""If you tell me that corporations are vital to American life, that the free-enterprise system has been the greatest wealth creator we've ever seen ... that I absolutely agree with,"" Obama said. But ""if, on the other hand, you tell me that every corporate tax break that's out there is somehow good for ordinary Americans ... then that I disagree with."" Romney and Perry are considered by most political analysts to be leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination. The president also dismissed growing Republican calls for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, arguing that such a dramatic change shouldn't be necessary to put America's fiscal house in order. ""We don't need to amend our Constitution in order to do that,"" Obama said. ""Why can't Congress simply make good choices?"" The president stressed that the federal government often needs to run deficits in cases of war or recession, partly in order to help state and local governments that are now required to keep their budgets in balance. While admitting that politically popular entitlement programs such as Medicare are contributing to Washington's spiraling deficits, Obama refused to offer details about what he is willing to do to help control medical costs. He stressed the need to lower health care costs as a whole, as opposed to going along with GOP attempts to ""voucherize"" Medicare and leave more responsibility for health expenses in the hands of vulnerable seniors. Turning his attention to national security, the president said federal officials are remaining vigilant as the country approaches the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks. ""The risk is always there,"" he said in response to a question about the prospect of an attack launched as revenge for the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Obama said the greatest threat at the moment is a potential ""lone wolf"" terror attack from a single individual, similar to what recently occurred in Norway. But ""as president of the United States, I worry about all of it,"" he said. Shortly before his sit-down interview with CNN, Obama talked about the best and worst parts of being president -- a position he called the ""greatest job on Earth."" He said the best part is hearing from regular people about how policies he has put in place have improved their lives. The worst part, Obama said, is when he talks to a family member of a fallen soldier. ""You're reminded of the incredible sacrifices that people are making for our country. And then when you see sometimes our politics not living up to that level of commitment and patriotism that we see from our troops, that gets a little bit frustrating,"" he said. The president wrapped up his regular interview by noting that if he is re-elected in 2012, his gift to daughters Sasha and Malia will be ""a continuation of Secret Service so that when boys want to start dating them, they are going to be surrounded by men with guns."" When he was elected in 2008, Obama told his daughters he would get them a puppy -- a promise that was eventually fulfilled.

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- A few years ago, researchers at Cornell made a remarkable discovery: When unsuspecting diners were given self-refilling bowls, they consumed almost twice as much soup as those with normal bowls. In other words, it was the quantity in the bowl that determined how much they ate, not their appetite. While researchers are only recently discovering the power of serving sizes, manufacturers have been manipulating consumers in this way for years, from stealthily shrinking the size of yogurt containers to super-sizing sodas. Now it's time for the government to take advantage of the power of portion size to save lives. We already know we should reduce the size of many of our food products -- not to mention our waistlines -- but there's another item that needs to go on a diet: the pack of cigarettes. It's time for the 10-cigarette pack. The government mandates 20 cigarettes per pack. But cigarette packs with fewer cigarettes could bolster willpower and help smokers quit. Let's imagine that you are one of the 70% of smokers who want to quit or cut back. Craving a cigarette, you have no option but to buy the full pack of 20 -- leaving 19 readily available to soon entice you. Would changing the pack size really help smokers quit? Many smokers don't purchase cartons, because they want to limit their smoking. They are willing to pay a higher price per cigarette to limit availability, fearing that easy access would increase their smoking. Now is the time to consider this move. Congress recently gave the Food and Drug Administration the jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. Before this congressional act, the FDA could regulate nicotine replacement therapies such as the patch and gum, but not the far more toxic tobacco. Now, the FDA has comprehensive authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing and sales of tobacco products. In fact, the FDA is developing new tobacco regulations; it should consider portion size. Most smokers actually want fewer cigarettes. The average number of cigarettes smoked per day declined among daily smokers from almost 19.6 in 1993 to not quite 16.8 in 2004, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Nondaily smokers consume even fewer cigarettes per day. A smaller pack can nudge smokers to smoke even less, just as buying only a pint of ice cream is safer for a dieter than buying a gallon. Evidence suggests that those who cut back are more likely to quit. Think about it: We could change what it means to be a pack-a-day smoker. The reason that we have the 20-cigarette pack is to prevent youths from smoking by keeping the price high. While preventing teen smoking is critical, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only about 14% of youths who smoke buy their own cigarettes directly from a store. The rest get them from family and friends. Moreover, cigarette prices are higher than ever because of increased federal, state and even city excise taxes -- perhaps making friends and family less likely to share and teens even less likely to buy. We have other ways to prevent kids from picking up the habit. For example, under the latest FDA regulations, flavored cigarettes that appeal to youths are banned, as is all outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of schools. And it is still illegal to sell to people younger than 18. Now that most smokers are trying to quit or cut back, we should allow or require smaller packs. If the size of the bowl can determine how much soup you eat, imagine what the size of the pack could do in determining how many cigarettes you smoke. It's time to find out how much size matters. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jody Sindelar.","Cigarette packs with fewer cigarettes could bolster willpower, Jody Sindelar says .

"(CNN) -- A West Virginia lawman known for cracking down on drugs will be buried Sunday. Walter E. ""Eugene"" Crum was gunned down while eating lunch in his squad car on Wednesday. His daughter said ""it's a strong possibility"" the Mingo County sheriff was killed for vigorously pursuing the illicit trade. Crum had taken office only three months prior to his killing but already had built a reputation for taking out dealers and shutting down ""pill mills."" ""My dad fought tirelessly against drug abuse. He just wanted to clean up the county and make it a better place to live,"" Crum's daughter, Julie Hall, told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday in her first television interview since her father was killed. ""Things are still under investigation at this time. We really are unsure,"" Hall said. Loved far and wide . A line of Mingo County residents who came to view Crum's body stretched out into the parking lot of the local high school Saturday evening, CNN affiliate WSAZ reported. Deputies drove up with Crum's widow, Rosie Crum, who is now sheriff, in the late afternoon. Fire and sheriff's department vehicles blocked off streets. Officers from various divisions across the state and from South Carolina lined the entrance to the school. They stood in unison sequence, their hands clasped in front of them, their heads bowed and their eyes gazing at the ground. Suspect in custody . Investigators have not publicly identified a possible motive in the case, but they have a suspect. Tennis Melvin Maynard, 37, is being treated at an area hospital after one of Crum's deputies wounded him, authorities said. 'Ambush' killings of lawmen part of increase . A witness saw the sheriff's shooting and called 911, giving police a license plate number and description of the car, the Mingo County sheriff's office has said. According to investigators, when deputies spotted Maynard, he led them on a high-speed chase before crashing his SUV. When he got out of his damaged vehicle, he pulled a gun, they said. Authorities have questioned Maynard twice, including shortly after he was shot. They will not disclose what he said the first time, and they said he was too medicated to give a lucid statement the second time, Williamson Police Chief Dave Rockel said. Emotionally disturbed . A search of Mingo County court records shows no criminal arrests or civil cases involving Maynard. His only citation involves failure to wear a seat belt, according to the records. Maynard's mother, Olgie, said her son spent time in a state hospital for mental health issues in recent years. ""He went crazy,"" she said, explaining that her son hadn't been the same since he was involved in a workplace explosion five or six years ago in Alabama. ""He was out in the yard yelling. We called the police, and they took him away."" Since then, she said, Tennis had gotten more psychiatric help at another mental health center. At home in Ragland, where he lives with his parents, he mostly stayed in his bedroom and watched television. ""He talks a lot to himself,"" she said. ""He was never violent."" The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has traced the gun that authorities say was used in the shooting of Crum, according to West Virginia State Police. But police have refused to release the results of the trace at this time or say whether the gun was purchased by the suspect. Crum's legacy . Crum made a name for himself within West Virginia law enforcement circles for his Operation Zero Tolerance, the anti-drug enforcement policy that he put into place shortly after taking office in January. Crum's wife, Rosie, was appointed Thursday to finish the remainder of her husband's term, with an election set for 2014.

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- Ten fraternity members at Tulane University face criminal charges in an alleged hazing incident in which pledges were repeatedly burned with hot water, cayenne pepper and vinegar, police said. Tulane University has suspended the Pi Kappa Alpha chapter, a spokesman says. Two pledges were treated at a hospital for severe burns resulting from the April 25 incident at the Pi Kappa Alpha house, authorities said. Seven students made their first appearance in court Wednesday and were released on their own recognizance, said Dalton Saywoir Jr., spokesman for the Orleans Parish District Attorney's office. It was unclear whether the three remaining students had been arrested or surrendered to police. The arrested students range in age from 20 to 22. All 10 students face charges of aggravated second-degree battery, New Orleans and Tulane police said in a statement. New Orleans attorney Frank D'Amico Jr., who represents one of the two pledges severely burned, said it happened at a ""Hell Night"" ritual involving the 10-member pledge class. ""What they were doing was burning the young men,"" he said. Fraternity brothers were said to have used boiling water containing pepper spray and a ""crab boil"" seasoning mixture containing cayenne pepper. The water was poured on the pledges' backs, he said. ""The ones who screamed first didn't get burned as badly,"" he said. But as the evening wore on and the water grew hotter and hotter, the ones who had not screamed were severely burned. D'Amico said his client, who was attending Tulane on scholarship, suffered second- and third-degree burns to his back, chest, buttocks and genitals. He is ""bandaged up,"" D'Amico said, and must have twice-daily burn treatments. The young man is unable to travel or take his exams and is attempting to negotiate with Tulane on postponing them, he said. The young man is ""obviously extremely traumatized,"" D'Amico said. Tulane University has suspended the Pi Kappa Alpha chapter and will investigate the incident in accordance with its anti-hazing policy, school spokesman Michael Strecker said in a statement. ""The university has zero tolerance for any type of hazing or other incident which can potentially endanger the well-being of any student,"" the statement said. ""Any fraternity member found to be in violation of the Student Code of Conduct will be held accountable."" Tulane is also cooperating with police, Strecker said. ""Such actions are nothing short of reprehensible, and are completely contrary to the mission, vision and purpose of our fraternity, if true,"" the fraternity said in a statement issued from its headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee. ""These types of actions represent a betrayal of our core values and the trust that the men who were hurt by these events placed in their fellow students."" But it said, ""these injuries appear to be the result of a few unauthorized, misguided individuals and not the entire chapter."" The arrested students did not comment as they were led into a police vehicle while handcuffed, according to video footage from CNN affiliate WWL. Pi Kappa Alpha headquarters did not immediately return a call seeking comment. D'Amico said he is pleased that Tulane and law enforcement have taken swift action on the matter. His client's parents sent their son to Tulane thinking he would be safe, he added, ""and they boil [the pledges] alive.""

"Washington (CNN) -- In what one member of Congress called ""a charade,"" a couple that showed up at President Obama's first state dinner -- uninvited, the White House claims -- declined to answer questions surrounding the event before a House committee Wednesday. Under questioning from House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, and others, Tareq Salahi repeated over and over again, ""On the advice of counsel, I respectfully assert my right to remain silent and decline to answer your question."" The Salahis' attorney notified the committee in December that because of a pending investigation by federal prosecutors, they would not answer questions about how they gained entry to the White House on November 24, despite not being on the guest list to attend that night's state dinner for the prime minister of India. In a brief statement that opened the often-contentious hearing, Salahi chastised the committee for requiring the couple to appear despite having been told the two would invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if subpoenaed. That, he alleged, is against the ethical rules of the Washington bar. He incensed some committee members by reiterating the couple's respect for U.S. troops, the Secret Service and the president. ""You have shown effrontery here,"" said Daniel Lungren, R-California. He called it ""an abomination"" that the Salahis would invoke the name of those in uniform ""and suggest that somehow what you do provides support to them."" ""The Constitution protects fools,"" Lungren said. ""The Constitution protects stupidity. The Constitution protects errant thought. Thank God it does."" ""This was not a hearing looking for information,"" the couple's attorney, Stephen Best, told reporters after the hearing. ""This was an opportunity for a public flogging."" ""I think today's procedure is a charade,"" Rep. Mark Souder, R-Indiana, said in the hearing, referring to the Salahis' refusal to answer questions. Other committee members also lambasted the couple, alleging they put their own desire for celebrity before the security of the president and are wasting the committee's time and taxpayers' money. ""I don't respect your right to take the Fifth Amendment. Not at all,"" Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-New Jersey, told the couple. ""Were you there?"" he asked Salahi, referring to the dinner. When Salahi began, ""On the advice ..."" Pascrell interrupted him, asking, ""Are you here right now? You gonna get an answer from your attorney on that?"" Pascrell noted the committee had offered to allow the couple to speak behind closed doors. After conferring with his attorney, Salahi said, ""Yes, but you didn't offer us any legal protection."" Salahi's wife, Michaele, also invoked her Fifth Amendment right under questioning by committee members, but replied, ""yes,"" when asked if she would return to testify after the investigation has concluded. Asked by Thompson whether the state dinner appearance was part of a ""reality TV stunt,"" Tareq Salahi said the couple was under a non-disclosure agreement and ""should not discuss matters related to the television matter."" The Salahis contend they were told they could attend the program to honor India's prime minister, but the White House says they were not invited and were not on the guest list for the exclusive affair. Best said after the hearing the couple received ""representations that they relied upon"" that they were invited guests. Two Secret Service investigators were privy to this information from a person who knows the Salahis, he said. ""This was not a stunt, and they committed no criminal act."" There was no connection to any reality TV show, he said, and the Salahis were not seeking publicity. The couple has turned down multiple offers from the media to be ""rewarded handsomely,"" he added. ""Whatever the real story is, it's on the other side of the gates of the White House, not with the Salahis,"" Best said. ""They thought they were invited. ... If it was a misunderstanding, it was a misunderstanding caused by representatives of the government."" Tareq Salahi also noted in his opening statement that the couple's attorneys have offered to provide information to the committee, but that offer was declined by Thompson's staff. ""Those offers are not satisfactory,"" Thompson said. ""These lawyers were not at the state dinner and have no firsthand knowledge of the facts."" Tareq Salahi also said the couple has provided phone records, e-mails and other documentary evidence to the committee. There also was criticism of the White House in Wednesday's hearing. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said the White House ""continues to stonewall"" and will not allow social secretary Desiree Rogers to testify on the security breach. Obama press secretary Robert Gibbs has said that allowing a White House staff member to testify before a congressional committee would violate the Constitution's separation of powers. ""I don't know what the White House is trying to hide,"" King said. ""Obviously, something went wrong, and it originated with the White House, not the Secret Service."" Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan, in previous testimony before the committee, took responsibility for the security breach, acknowledging that ""appropriate procedures were not followed."" Rep. Charles Dent, R-Pennsylvania, said Wednesday he thought it was ""unfortunate"" that Sullivan ""had to take all that grief from us."" ""I hold you responsible for it,"" he told the Salahis. ""Your actions ... made a mockery of this country, a mockery of our security,"" Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, told the couple. ""I'm saddened, and I'm disappointed, and I'm outraged."" Best reiterated afterward the Salahis do not want the events surrounding the dinner to detract from the ""extraordinary institution"" of the Secret Service. ""They are Americans,"" he said. ""They are proud Americans.""","Tareq and Michaele Salahi decline to answer questions at congressional hearing .

"(CNN) -- Adopting a fascist salute to celebrate a goal in any country would border on the provocative -- but to do it in a land where the scars of Germany's wartime occupation still run deep would appear to be professional suicide. So it has proved for AEK Athens' Giorgos Katidis, whose actions after scoring the winning goal against Veria on Saturday so enraged Greek football officials that the former Under-19 captain has been barred from playing for the senior national team for life. ""The action by the player to salute spectators with a Nazi salute defies common sense, profoundly shows disrespect to all the victims of Nazi atrocities and injures the peaceful and deeply human character of football,"" said the Greek football federation. ""The federation condemns unequivocally and categorically such actions."" Katidis, who turned 20 last month and led Greece to the final of last year's European Under-19 Championships in Estonia, has denied having any knowledge of the significance of his actions. ""I'm not a racist -- no way,"" he wrote on his Twitter site. ""I hate fascism. I wouldn't have done it if I knew it meant something like that. I know the consequences."" As this weekend's international break approaches, not to mention the many more that will follow, the tattooed youngster may be well advised to study his history. For despite the seven decades that have passed, many Greeks still shudder when they recollect the 300,000 citizens who died as the Nazis controlled mainland Greece between 1941 and 1944. This would have been the very first good reason for the midfielder to avoid celebrating his goal in the Super League in the style he did -- but unfortunately for him, there were several more. The recent financial crisis affecting his country has heralded a rise in popularity for the neo-fascist party Golden Dawn, one of Europe's most controversial -- and right-wing -- parties. Having taken just 0.2% in Greece's 2009 elections, the far right group's campaign for the 2012 elections involved an aggressive anti-immigration stance, feeding upon the chronic financial anxiety of those suffering from both unemployment and austerity measures. The campaigning stance was so successful it resulted in a significant 7% of the vote -- and 18 seats in parliament. While many Greeks are ashamed of Golden Dawn's burgeoning popularity -- and would never want to be associated with them in any way -- Katidis' actions came while playing for a club founded by immigrants in the 1920s. Despite the furore, the midfielder has received support from his coach Ewald Lienan, who -- as a German -- could have been forgiven for criticizing the footballer's actions. ""He is a young kid who does not have any political ideas. He most likely saw such a salute on the internet, or somewhere else, and did it without knowing what it means,"" Lienan said. ""I am 100% sure that Giorgos did not know what he did. He was crying in the dressing room seeing how the media reacted. He is young and needs protection."" Katsidis' late goal was of great significance to both AEK and the club's fans, given that the 2-1 win enabled one of Greek football's traditional giants -- currently in a crisis -- to pull four points clear of the relegation zone. Yet his celebration in front of the supporters in the Olympic Stadium only served to alienate a section who had initially reveled in his onfield display. ""There is no way we can forgive fascist salutes,"" said influential supporters' group -- Original 21 -- in a statement directed at Katidis. ""You are not welcome among us -- you are wanted! We are not convinced by your tears or by your excuses. Fascists and Nazis do not belong in AEK."" Meanwhile, the Greek federation has told CNN that the ban on Katidis only applies to internationals and has no bearing on his standing within his club. AEK, champions on 11 occasions but whose stock has mirrored the Greek economy's by plummeting in recent years, have asked the player to explain his actions on Wednesday -- the same day Super League officials are set to discuss the case. In 2005, Lazio striker Paolo di Canio was handed a one-match ban by Italian football authorities after making a fascist salute towards his club's fans during a game against Juventus. Greek media has reported that Katidis has been given time off by the club in order to visit his wife in Italy since the incident, with many reporting that his AEK future is in doubt. Just seven months into a four-year contract signed last August, the fortunes of a youngster who rose to prominence after impressing at Aris Salonika have been derailed for the most unlikely of reasons.","Giorgos Katidis barred for life from senior Greek national team after fascist salute .

"Washington (CNN) -- Anticipating possible political backlash if forced federal spending cuts kick in as expected later this week, the Senate's No. 2 Republican said Monday that he is preparing a message he plans to hit hard: The cuts are not going to have as negative an impact as the Pentagon and others in the Obama administration are saying. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said he plans to make the case to other Republicans and the public that despite warnings from the Pentagon that the mandated cuts will be devastating, the overall amount of defense spending will actually still rise. Cornyn conceded that until now he had been parroting what Defense Secretary Leon Panetta continuously warns -- that automatic, government-wide cuts could jeopardize national security. But the veteran senator said he looked into it and will now argue that even if the cuts go through on March 1, the Pentagon will still see its budget go up. Cornyn's preview of what he hopes will be a Senate GOP argument is significant since defense cuts are usually something Republicans adamantly oppose. He will surely run up against some in his party who strongly disagree. To be sure, Cornyn called himself a defense ""hawk"" and did say the role of the federal government should be first and foremost to protect American citizens. Where you'll feel forced spending cuts . But he also believes that the deficit should be paramount since the United States has ended its fighting in Iraq and is winding down the war in Afghanistan. He added that if ""God forbid"" another 9/11 happens, Congress would act. Still, Senate Republicans are considering a proposal this week that could alleviate some impacts of the cuts by giving the president flexibility to decide where they would occur. However, GOP sources tell CNN that Republicans have not yet worked out among themselves whether their measure would give the president that flexibility on all domestic agencies and programs or just on defense. GOP sources say they are likely to work that out when Senate Republicans huddle for their regular lunch on Tuesday. The $85 billion in forced spending cuts were written into law intentionally to be indiscriminate. Opinion: If spending is cut, GOP will get the blame . The law does not allow, for example, the Pentagon to keep funding going for a ship building program by shifting money being spent on a military golf course. And it does not allow the Health and Human Services Department to keep children in Head Start programs by cutting deeper in another agency. Part of the reason Senate GOP leaders have not decided yet how broad that flexibility should be -- whether it should apply just to the defense cuts, as many Republicans want, or to domestic cuts as well â€” is due to differences in opinion among Republicans over how much power to give the president. But it is a key decision, since granting the president flexibility in cuts across the board could make it hard for conservative Democrats, such as those from defense industry-rich Virginia, to oppose. That's because such an approach could soften the political burden for those Democrats who would be able to argue to their constituents they did everything possible -- including providing flexibility to the White House -- if economic damage ripples through their states. But one influential Republican senator told CNN on Sunday that he opposes giving the president so much flexibility because it undermines the decision-making authority of Congress. Opinion: There's plenty to cut at the Pentagon . ""I say to my Republican friends, if you want to give the president flexibility as to how to exact these cuts in defense spending, then why don't we go home and just give him the money? I am totally opposed to that,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""We spent too long on defense authorization and finding out what this country needs to secure this country without saying, 'Hey, well we'll just let the president have the, quote, flexibility.'"" A competing Senate Democratic proposal would replace the automatic spending cuts with a mix of tax increases on wealthier Americans and more targeted spending reductions than those currently required. Democratic leaders believe it will get more than 50 votes -- so they will be able to claim it won a majority in the chamber -- but will fall short of the 60 it would need to win Senate approval. In the meantime, both sides are preparing for no change -- and for forced spending cuts to take effect Friday. Democratic leadership sources admit that whether or not they can ultimately do anything to change the way across-the-board cuts are enacted will depend on the level of public outcry -- and media coverage. Democrats admit the impact may not be felt for at least a month, maybe more. Assuming no legislation is passed to alter the cuts this week, sources in both parties say they are already looking ahead to the next big deadline on March 27, when the funding for the government runs out. A Democratic congressional source tells CNN that at this point, Democrats do not believe the White House wants to use that debate to revisit forced spending cuts, but the source said that could change depending on public reaction to the cuts.","Texas senator believes cuts may not be as bad for defense as the Pentagon says .

"(CNN) -- Las Ramblas rumbled. The foundations of La Sagrada Familia began to shake. Camp Nou was silenced. A shadow cast itself across the city as the sun dipped beneath the stands. Amidst the rising tension a diminutive figure rose. He bent down, tied his laces and strode forward. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Those sat around the amphitheater rose in celebration, the enemy shrunk back into their skins, the victory was already assured. As Lionel Messi placed his feet onto the Camp Nou turf you could see a visible chill go down the spine of each and every Paris Saint-Germain player. Leading 1-0 and with a place in the semifinals of the Champions League within touching distance, PSG looked set to produce one of the most remarkable results of the competition. A 2-2 draw in last week's first leg appeared to have given Barcelona the edge in a tie which the Catalan club was expected to breeze through. But when Javier Pastore shook the very foundations of one of Europe's greatest bastions, a cloud began to descend upon manager Tito Vilanova and his ailing players. Barcelona might be 13 points clear at the top of La Liga, but this was not a performance which engendered confidence. Suddenly there was doubt, anxiety, even fear. And then in a matter of minutes, everything had changed. Order had been restored. Just nine minutes after Messi's introduction, Barcelona was level as the French resistance wilted under the wizardry of the game's most talented attacking force. The four-time World Player of the Year has scored 57 times this season, but just his mere presence was enough to unnerve his opponents. A 1-1 draw was enough to take Barcelona through on away goals after the two teams finished level at 3-3 on aggregate. But it could have been so different had the French side taken the chances afforded to them during a frantic opening 45 minutes. Ezequiel Lavezzi wasted the most clear-cut opportunity, racing onto Zlatan Ibrahimovic's through ball only to fire straight at the onrushing Victor Valdes. Lucas Moura forced Valdes into a sharp save when he headed Ibrahimovic's cross towards goal as the visiting side began to turn the screw. The French league leaders continued to look threatening and it came as no surprise when it finally grabbed the initiative five minutes after the break. Once again it was enigmatic Ibrahimovic who created the opportunity, threading the ball through to Pastore. The Argentine playmaker took the ball in his stride before lashing home a left-footed effort which left Valdes with no chance. But no sooner had the ball hit the net than a certain somebody was already preparing to make a grand entrance. As Messi began to warm-up on the sideline, the crowd responded. Suddenly, the fear and anxiety which had gripped those adorned in the blue and red of Barcelona began to dissipate. His entrance onto the pitch with 28 minutes remaining seemed to breathe new life into a Barcelona side which had failed to produce anything of note in front of goal. But with Messi, albeit not a 100% Messi on the field, the home side began to tick and within nine minutes of his introduction it was level. Inevitably it was the Argentine who made the difference, jinking his way past two white shirts before rolling the ball in for David Villa, who laid it off for Pedro to rifle home. That goal sealed Barcelona's place in the semifinals for the sixth consecutive year and defender Gerard Pique believes his side ran out worthy winners. ""I think Barca has shown a lot of quality in the six years and I think we deserve it again to be in the semifinals,"" Pique told Sky Sports. ""Paris St-Germain is very strong with good quality but I think we deserved it. ""In the first leg we deserved a little more and tonight we're very happy to have qualified. ""It doesn't matter if he's a little bit injured he can change everything. ""We are very proud and lucky to have him in our side. He's our reference as a striker - he can score, he can pass he can do anything and everything."" PSG coach Carlo Ancelotti added: ""I thought we played well. We caused Barca problems, but Messi is a fantastic player and can find a solution for his team even when not fully fit."" In the night's other game, Bayern Munich produced a hugely impressive performance to book its place in the last four courtesy of a 2-0 win over Juventus. Leading 2-0 from the first leg, Bayern eased past the Italian side thanks to goals from Mario Mandzukic and Claudio Pizarro. Bayern, which lost in the final to Chelsea in Munich last year, joins Bundesliga rival Borussia Dortmund in the semifinals. It is the first time two German clubs have made the last four of the competition in the same season. And winger Arjen Robben, who was denied a goal of his own by the woodwork, is keen to avoid Jurgen Klopp's side in the next round. ""If you win away 2-0 in Turin here I think that's an amazing result because they are unbeaten for I don't know how many games and they are so strong at the back,"" Robben told Sky Sports. ""Even more, if you dominate the game in the second half as we did, it is a great performance. ""We would like to be kept apart from Borussia Dortmund in the semifinals but we don't have a choice and it comes out how it comes. ""It going to be a big one and the semifinals have maybe the four best teams at the moment."" Bayern will now compete in their third semifinal in four years, but it must do without Mandzukic in the first leg with the Croatia star set to serve a one-game ban. Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon believes Bayern's extra experience was a key factor in the outcome of the tie. He told Sky Sports: ""The big difference between them and us is experience. I was even more impressed tonight than in Munich. ""In the first leg we did not give our all, but tonight we did and still there was nothing we could do. I think Bayern can win the Champions League.""","Barcelona claims 1-1 draw against PSG to qualify for semifinals .

"(CNN) -- In one picture, the political candidate wears a bright blue business suit, standing with her arms crossed beside her campaign pledge to bring ""hope for your family."" In another, she wears white lace underwear and angel wings. Both images show Giselle Arellano, who was running for a spot on the ballot as a conservative National Action Party candidate representing migrants in the local congress of Mexico's Zacatecas state. The 33-year-old's candidacy came under fire earlier this month after some accused her of working as an escort in Las Vegas. Arellano lost a party primary this week, but Tuesday she said that she's planning to contest the results. She denies that she ever worked as an escort and says the risque images of her, which sparked debate when they started circulating online and in local media reports earlier this month, came from a modeling shoot. Arellano accused political opponents of attacking her and all women in Zacatecas. ""Those who have orchestrated this campaign will not be successful, because these angel wings that are seen in the video, are those that have allowed many women to fly through these kinds of storms and the macho desires of those who keep seeing women as objects,"" she wrote on her website. She said the widely circulated video, which shows her scantily clad and posing with several other women, was promoting a party in Las Vegas that she did not attend. ""I am not ashamed of it. ... I want to make it very clear, that I do not own nor have I ever worked in a brothel, nor have I been an escort,"" she wrote. But the video drew the attention of leaders from the National Action Party, who disavowed her candidacy last week, saying she did not have ""an honest means of living,"" Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency reported. In campaign videos, Arellano says she competed in beauty pageants, studied marketing, speaks five languages, worked as a translator in immigrant courts in Los Angeles and started two businesses in Las Vegas. ""I have lived in flesh and blood the pain of migration, and I know the needs that come up when you are in a foreign country. I have also suffered discrimination. I know the great effort of migrants to achieve their goals,"" she says. ""There has been much speculation about my character on social networks and in some media, about my past. Today, I am here facing it, because I am ashamed of nothing. I have a calm conscience and I am good with God.""

"(CNN) -- Pounding humidity, a treacherous climb and bees who were more than happy to sting: Tough conditions for ash boarding down a live volcano, and halfway up Nicaragua's Cerro Negro, it didn't seem like such a good idea. But then there was the view: A cascade of grey-black ash and rock stretching to the horizon, giving the hilly landscape an alien quality. We walked in single file carrying our boards and a bag full of gear for nearly an hour until we reached the summit. Approaching the edge of the volcano, the 1,600 foot slope was pretty steep and uninviting. Our guide consoled us with the knowledge that we were lucky to have our plywood and metal boards as someone else had gone down the volcano on a bicycle. And nearly died. Still, I donned my prison-style boiler suit and goggles, sat on the board and let myself slide. It was a thrill as I quickly gathered speed, scraping over pebbles and eating flying grit until I finally wiped out at the bottom. The activity is one of Nicaragua's more unusual tourist hooks. Pioneered by the Australian owner of a hostel in the nearby city of Leon in 2005, ash boarding down Central America's youngest volcano has become a cottage industry. The Bigfoot hostel is now owned by Brazilian Breno Oliveira, who says the tourism industry is becoming more competitive as it develops. ""When Bigfoot first started it, it was something new. And then it became bigger and bigger. This brings a lot of business,"" says Oliveira. Competition is growing. He says hotels and hostels in Leon have grown from two to more than 40 in seven years. ""This to be honest is the main income of the hostel, if it didn't have the ash boarding it would just be a hostel and it becomes very difficult to survive."" Tourism's role . For many, especially in the United States, Nicaragua is associated with 1980s-era Marxist guerillas and the Iran-Contra scandal. Corruption and U.S. embargoes certainly took their toll on the country and by the time the Sandinistas left power in 1990, the tourism industry was a basket case. Yet Nicaragua has always had huge potential. Known as the ""Land of Lakes and Volcanoes,"" it has immense natural beauty and alluring colonial towns. It's still very underdeveloped -- the second poorest country in the hemisphere -- and you can expect to experience power cuts and traffic jams behind horse carts on main highways. Per capita income is barely more than $1,200 a year, so for a country like Nicaragua, tourism is actually the second largest industry -- and an engine for lifting the population out of poverty. The latest figures for this year reveal an increase in visitors of 12% from 2011. ""The tourism industry of Nicaragua has been growing at an important rate in the last few years,"" says Mario Salinas, the country's Tourism Minister. ""And it's becoming one of the two or three top generators of foreign currency and employment for our country."" A mandatory destination on any itinerary is Grenada. Perched on Lake Nicaragua, the largest lake in Central America, the city is renowned for its stunning architecture. It was founded by the Spanish in 1524 and subsequently razed three times by pirates but was rebuilt and served as a conservative stronghold during the country's civil war. The city is overshadowed by the hulking Mombacho Volcano, a popular hiking destination. There is also a galaxy of hundreds of small islands formed from a volcanic eruption thousands of years ago and strewn across Lake Nicaragua. Driving down the lake's malecon looking for a tour boat, it was clear waterfront development had been approached with great ambition. Somehow the vision fell short: rows of bars, restaurants and nightclubs looked like they had been closed for months. Once out on the lake, the tranquil tour of the islets gives you the opportunity to gawp at the holiday homes of some of the country's richest families. Each dominate certain sections of the economy -- such as media or brewing -- and naturally each owns an islet. Occasional ""For sale"" signs rise up out of the water, and in case you're interested, an island will set you back around $400,000 -- negotiable. Country at a crossroads . But be careful. According to the U.S. State Department, property laws in Nicaragua are somewhat murky: ""Establishing verifiable title history is often entangled in legalities relating to the expropriation of 28,000 properties by the revolutionary government in the 1980s."" The State Department says this remains a key impediment to attracting greater foreign investment in the tourism industry, a claim Salinas obviously rejects. ""There are many international agreements that Nicaragua has signed with other countries to protect the safety of foreign investment,"" he says. ""We haven't seen complications from 2007 until now and what could have happened is that the government may have verified a few properties to be completely sure of the origin of those properties."" The Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega, once dismissed as a dinosaur, swept back into power in 2007 and has since been re-elected in an election condemned by international observers for its irregularities. Many may balk at the return of such a notorious figure, but the government says he is making tourism a priority and understands the conditions needed to attract visitors. San Juan del Sur has certainly maintained its inviting atmosphere. The laid back surfing mecca is close to the border with Costa Rica and may be the ideal place to wind down your tour. A young Mark Twain famously arrived here by boat in 1866 and was entranced by the ""bright green hills"" that form a semi-circle around the bay. Then a ramshackle primitive port, San Juan has grown into a ramshackle party town whose waterfront is lined with several bars catering to young tourists. During the day, the local tourism industry exploits the town's natural blessings. San Juan's main beach is largely a fishing and transit hub and the main surfing spots are a 20-minute drive away. The roads deteriorate rapidly as you leave town and a 4x4 vehicle was needed to get through the final stages of one route to the beach. But like Nicaragua as a whole, it's worth the effort: The waves are superb and the shorelines shockingly underdeveloped and wild. Nonsurfers can head to the high seas for some world-class deep-sea fishing and may be surprised at their unusual level of success. Nicaragua holds a great variety of experiences for any visitor, and the country is one of few states whose immediate future really is tied to the tourism industry. For now, it's seemingly at a crossroads, with many of the big developers watching the turn of events.","Nicaragua's tourism industry is a big part of the economy .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- An international sports icon is behind bars. His girlfriend is dead. And South Africa is grappling with one of its most notorious killings in recent memory. Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius, known as Blade Runner for his lightning-fast prosthetic legs, shook and sobbed Friday when a judge officially charged him with killing his girlfriend on Valentine's Day. Wearing a dark suit, he buried his head in his hands at a packed courtroom in Pretoria. Prosecutors said they plan to charge the 26-year-old with premeditated murder. Pistorius rejects the murder allegation ""in the strongest terms,"" his agent, Peet Vanzuyl, told CNN. His girlfriend, model Reeva Steenkamp, was found in a pool of blood at Pistorius' home Thursday in an upscale neighborhood in the capital. Neighbors alerted authorities to the early morning shooting, saying they had ""heard things earlier,"" according to police spokeswoman Denise Beukes. She did not clarify what the neighbors reported they heard. The track star was arrested the same day. Steenkamp's killing rattled South Africa, not only for the fame factor, but also because the country is grappling with a disturbing problem -- 71% of women report that they've been the victim of sexual abuse. Just in the past few weeks, 17-year-old Anene Booyson died after being gang-raped and mutilated in the tiny tourist town of Bredasdorp, two hours southeast of Cape Town. Booyson's death inspired this week's nationwide rape awareness day dubbed Black Friday. The day before she was killed, Steenkamp retweeted a message on Twitter in support of Black Friday. While police have not discussed a possible motive for the model's killing, local media reported that Pistorius had mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder. South Africa has a high crime rate, and many homeowners keep weapons to protect themselves from intruders. But Beukes, the police spokeswoman, stressed that this scenario did not come from authorities. There was no evidence of forced entry at the home, she said. Police said there had been previous ""allegations of a domestic nature"" at his house, but they did not elaborate. Investigators found a pistol at the scene. South Africa's gun debate . On a larger stage, Steenkamp's killing has given gun control advocates a spotlight to push for stricter laws. Gunpolicy.org says there are just under 6 million licensed firearms in South Africa, a country of 50 million people. ""There are 1.5 million gun owners -- about 3.5 million guns in civilians hands,"" said Alan Storey, chairman of Gun Free South Africa. Most of the victims of gun homicides are between the ages 20 and 30, he said. South Africa has passed tough legislation that includes a requirement for a thorough background check for prospective gun owners. The check includes spouses and partners, and is repeated every few years, he said. WATCH: Police probe shooting at Pistorius home . ""People acquire guns believing they are more safe ... but they place themselves at great risk,"" Storey said. ""We've made airplanes a gun-free zone. We need to bring that logic down to earth."" But the South African Gunowners' Association, a popular gun lobby group, has said citizens have the right to protect themselves from increasingly violent crimes. ""There are already more than enough laws and regulations to control the possession of firearms by private citizens,"" it says on its website. ""Fewer and less complex laws reasonably, yet properly, applied could achieve the required objective."" One issue in South Africa is stolen guns. Guns are often stolen from home, reports show, but also from the police. Statistics suggest that 18,196 police firearms have been lost or stolen during the five-year period beginning April 1 2005 to March 31 2011. From hero to murder suspect . Beyond the violence, South Africans struggled with the idea that they've lost a hero, an athlete who embodied what it meant to overcome incredible physical odds. When Pistorius was a toddler, his legs were amputated below the knees because of a bone defect. Earning the nickname ""Blade Runner,"" Pistorius runs on special carbon fiber blades. He became the first Paralympic sprinter competing against able-bodied athletes at the London Olympics last year. His face became a fixture on billboards across the nation, and he and Steenkamp were photographed at high-profile celebrity events and around town. Hours after the news of his arrest, some of the billboards started coming down. His sponsors also pulled away. Nike removed an ad featuring him from its website showing him taking off for a run with the words ""I am the bullet in the chamber."" Other Pistorius sponsors -- including prosthetics manufacturer Ossur, British Telecom, and Oakley, which makes sunglasses and other products -- expressed condolences and said they had no further comment. The sports icon appeared in headlines across the nation, overshadowing the State of the Union address by President Jacob Zuma. ""Golden Boy Loses Shine,"" read a headline on the front page of the Sowetan. The Pretoria court postponed Pistorius' bail hearing to Tuesday and ordered him to remain in custody until then. Prosecutors said they will argue that he committed premeditated murder. Authorities said they will oppose bail, but did not provide their reasons for the decision. He shattered barriers . The double amputee's London Olympics appearance brought controversy, as some said the prosthetic limbs gave him an advantage. Pistorius was initially refused permission to enter the Olympics, but he hired a legal team to prove that his artificial limbs did not give him an unfair advantage, and he was allowed to compete. While he did not win a medal, his presence on the track was lauded as an example of victory over adversity and dedication to a goal. In the 2012 Paralympics, held a few weeks after the Olympics, he smashed a record to win the men's 400-meter in the final athletics event of the Games. In October, he discussed the ""massive blessing"" of inspiring people around the world. ""Being an international sportsman, there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that,"" he told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" PHOTOS: The career of Oscar Pistorius .

"(CNN) -- Florida Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll has resigned, it was announced Wednesday, the day after she answered questions from investigators about her role in an allegedly corrupt veterans' charity. The resignation came the same day 57 people connected to the charity, Allied Veterans of the World, were arrested on racketeering and money laundering charges. Leaders in the company, which operates Internet gambling parlors, are accused of donating little of its proceeds to veterans, and instead buying luxury goods for themselves. ""I want any funds from these groups to immediately be given to charity. I have zero tolerance for this kind of criminal activity, period,"" Gov. Rick Scott said Wednesday. In a two-sentence resignation letter delivered to Scott, Carroll said it was an ""honor to have served."" She consulted for Allied Veterans, but was not among those arrested Wednesday. ""Carroll consulted for this company in 2009 and 2010 when she was serving in the Florida House of Representatives,"" Scott said at the press conference. ""The Florida Department of Law Enforcement interviewed Lt. Gov. Carroll about her work for this company, and yesterday Lt. Gov. Carroll resigned in an effort to keep her affiliation with the company from distracting our efforts to help make sure we do the right thing for Florida families."" Scott said he wouldn't elaborate on any potential connection between Carroll and Allied Veterans of the World, but did say he appreciated ""the efforts she made on behalf of the state of Florida. She was tireless. She put a lot of effort into military and getting jobs going and I am grateful for her service."" Carroll, a Republican, assumed office in January 2011, having been elected with Scott in 2010. She was the first African-American elected to Florida statewide office, according to her official biography.

"AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- Alexis Ohanian is not the mayor of the Internet. He was proclaimed as such by Forbes magazine and, obviously, there's no such thing. But the man who's become one of the most visible advocates for a free and open Web over the past year says that the very idea goes against the spirit of what he's fighting for. ""The Internet has my axe, insofar as I can be helpful as a voice or a person on camera or someone at a protest,"" the 29-year-old Ohanian, best known as a co-founder of social-sharing site Reddit, said via a deft ""Lord of the Rings"" reference. ""I will use it. But the reality is that the magic of the Internet is that there isn't any hierarchy to it. It's this flat connection of people where all links are created equal."" Ohanian spoke with CNN shortly after giving a presentation at the South by Southwest Interactive festival here -- one in which he shared stories from the Internet 2012 Bus Tour he and Reddit general manager Erik Martin launched during last year's election season. The tour, partially crowdfunded on Indiegogo, rolled from Colorado to Kentucky and highlighted individuals and businesses whose success has been impacted by an open Web. They ranged from a rural family farmer who said he makes 90% of his money through Internet sales to two women who met via their virtual Etsy stores and eventually launched a brick-and-mortar jewelry shop together in St. Louis. They're feel-good stories, but also ones that roll into a narrative about how government controls on the Internet can be dangerous to freedom, job creation and other rights and goals, Ohanian said. ""When you can actually say, 'There is a farmer in your district right now whose life has been changed -- whose business has been transformed -- because of the Internet economy ...' it becomes a lot more real,"" he says. Ohanian emerged as a vocal opponent of the Stop Online Piracy Act. Geared toward clamping down on Internet piracy, critics argued that the way it was written would have given the entertainment industry the ability to shutdown otherwise legitimate websites if it was found they were wrongly hosting copyrighted material. With help from Web bigwigs like Google, Wikipedia and Facebook, opponents eventually killed SOPA and a similar piece of legislation in the Senate. Ohanian, who also helped launch travel site Hipmunk and runs Breadpig, a site that gives all proceeds to social causes, said that like some of his other successes, his role was a matter of good timing. ""When I stepped away from Hipmunk, this fight became my focus. I had a lot of time to devote to it,"" he said. ""What really won the day was millions of people taking action. ""Where I fit into that mix was, I live in New York ... when the media finally had to talk about it, I could get on the subway and spend literally the entire day meeting with every major news organization, being on TV."" These days, he and others from the SOPA fight are setting their sights on another bill, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. It's designed to help authorities use Web tools to track criminals, but critics say it's a ""Big Brother"" plan that strips Fourth Amendment privacy rights. So, mayor of the Internet is out. But at his presentation Friday, Ohanian called on the audience to get active in politics. ""We need more nerds in Congress,"" he said. And, last week, he shared on his social accounts a ""rumor roundup"" article from a tech blog that said Ohanian, himself, might be mulling a run for office. ""No comment,"" he cheekily wrote. So? ""Oh, it has popped into my mind,"" he said. ""Actually -- and this is bad for the rumor roundup -- I had registered (Web domain name) 'ohanian2013' ... I talked to some people who have done it before and whom I trusted for council."" But in the end, Ohanian (who, at 29, couldn't shoot for the U.S. Senate for another year at any rate) said he thinks he can do more for the cause from where he sits now. ""I am having so much, I think, success in the private sector. It's a cost-benefit analysis,"" he said. ""Why would I trade off the freedoms I have as a private-sector individual if I'm having as much, if not more, impact."" Also, he joked, he's not qualified to be a politician. ""I see the hypocrisy of going on stage and telling people we should have more geeks in office then not doing it myself,"" he said. ""But, you know what? By sheer virtue of the fact that I can acknowledge my own hypocrisy, I know I'm not capable of running for office.""","Reddit's Ohanian says the beauty of the Web is its lack of a power hierarchy .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A former southern California schoolteacher entered a not guilty plea Tuesday to allegations he bound young students, then photographed them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and three-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces, among other graphic depictions. Authorities have said they have discovered roughly 600 images allegedly taken by Mark Berndt, 61, in his classroom. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Marcelita Haynes set the next hearing for March 28. Berndt's lawyer is asking to see all of the photographs seized by investigators, but the district attorney's office has only given him copies of 200 photos of the 23 alleged victims who have been identified. The judge will consider if the remaining photos, including those where the children have not been identified, will be given to the defense. Berndt, wearing an orange jail jumpsuit, spoke only once during the short hearing, saying ""not guilty."" The defense complained to the judge that Berndt was not allowed to shave before his court appearance. ""They are purposefully depriving him of this opportunity so he looks unkempt,"" rather than like a professional educator, his lawyer said. Victor Acevedo also complained that jailers have identified Berndt as a child molester on the jail's speaker system. ""We cannot have the sheriff's department deputies acting in such a way to essentially put a bull's-eye on his head,"" Acevedo told reporters after the hearing. The sheriff ordered an internal affairs investigation of the complaint Tuesday, sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. Jail supervisors said they were unaware of the incident, Whitmore said. Berndt's court-appointed lawyer pleaded with journalists outside court to ""not to poison the well"" against Berndt in the minds of potential jurors with their reporting. He reminded them of the Duke lacrosse rape case in which three players were accused of sexually assaulting an exotic dancer at a March 14, 2006, party. ""Everybody was basically guilty in the media and at the very end, when everything was found out, they dismissed all the charges against all of the lacrosse players,"" Acevedo said. He vowed that he would mount a ""very vigorous defense"" of the former teacher. Attorney Gloria Allred, known for taking high-profile, controversial cases, was in court to observe. She said she was recently hired by the parent of one of Berndt's alleged victims. Dismissed by the Los Angeles Unified School District school board about a year ago, Berndt was arrested January 30. He appeared in court two days later, after which he was ordered held on $23 million bail -- $1 million for each of the 23 counts of lewd acts on a child that he faces. All of those initial 23 victims were between 7 and 10 years old, and all but two of them were girls, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. Since Berndt's initial appearance, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Sgt. Dan Scott said an additional 200 photographs purportedly taken by the longtime Miramonte Elementary School teacher had been found. It is uncertain what, if any, additional charges Berndt may face as a result of that discovery or other developments in the investigation. The law enforcement probe began when investigators found ""over 40 photographs depicting children in a school classroom, with their eyes blindfolded and mouths covered with tape,"" a Los Angeles County sheriff's statement said. ""Investigators learned that some of the photos depicted suspect Mark Berndt with his arm around the children, or with his hand over their mouths,"" according to the sheriff's department. Some photos showed ""children with large live Madagascar-type cockroaches on their faces and mouths."" Others show female students with ""what appeared to be a blue plastic spoon, filled with an unknown clear/white liquid substance, up to their mouths as if they were going to ingest the substance,"" said the sheriff's department. Scott said that Berndt was arrested soon after lab testing matched Berndt's DNA with a substance -- later determined to be semen -- from a blue plastic spoon and an empty container from a trash bin in his classroom. The young students ""didn't realize they were victimized,"" said the sheriff's department spokesman. ""They thought they were being blindfolded and gagged as a game,"" Scott added. ""And they were rewarded with cookies or spoons full of sugar, (but) they did not realize the spoon contained semen."" A search of Berndt's home found hundreds of photographs depicting children and a video showing sexual ""bondage"" activity that ""mirrored the bondage-type photos of the children,"" investigators said. Parent Bessy Garcia, the mother of two children who were among Berndt's alleged victims, spoke of betrayal. ""He wasn't only a teacher, he was our personal friend,"" she told CNN earlier this month. ""He tricked us. We thought he was the best person in the world."" Los Angeles School Superintendent John Deasy said that Berndt was removed from his teaching job in January 2011, after school officials learned of the police investigation. A teacher for 30 years, Berndt initially challenged the school district's decision to dismiss him. But he eventually dropped his appeal and resigned last spring. His arrest this January precipitated a broader fallout, into the adequacy of safeguards for the school's students and the prospect of more victims. Days after Berndt was taken into custody, another Miramonte Elementary teacher -- Martin Springer, 49 -- was arrested and charged with three felony counts of lewd acts with a girl under the age of 14. He has pleaded not guilty. The school board subsequently shut Miramonte down for two days, during which the board reconstituted the entire staff in the 1,400-student school. Miramonte is located in unincorporated Los Angeles County within the Florence-Firestone area, about 6 miles south of downtown Los Angeles. CNN's Casey Wian contributed to this report.","Defense attorney asks no rush to judgment .

"(CNN) -- Gambia plans to execute all death row prisoners by September, the president said this week, sparking condemnation from human rights groups worldwide. The tiny West African nation last executed an inmate about 30 years ago. It is unclear what prompted the change in stance. By the end of last year, Gambia had 44 people on death row, including two women, according to human rights activists. Death row convicts will be executed by mid-September, President Yahya Jammeh said in a speech on state media Sunday that was rebroadcast Monday. ""All those guilty of serious crimes and are condemned will face the full force of the law,"" he said. ""All punishments prescribed by law will be maintained in the country to ensure that criminals get what they deserve: that is, that those who kill are killed ... By the middle of next month, all the death sentences would have been carried out to the letter."" The nation imposes capital punishment for various crimes, including murder and treason, the latter commonly used to stifle dissent in some African nations. Previously on CNN.com: Death row inmate leads authorities to hundreds of bone fragments . In 2010, British human rights group Reprieve said Gambia had introduced the death penalty for those found with more than 250 grams of cocaine or heroin. It's unclear whether the law still stands. Amnesty International, the French government and other rights groups condemned the execution order. ""President Jammeh's comments are deeply troubling and will undoubtedly cause severe anguish to those on death row and their families,"" said Audrey Gaughran, the Africa director for Amnesty. ""Any attempt to carry out this threat would be both deeply shocking and a major setback for human rights in Gambia."" International standards on fair trials are not followed in the country, according to Gaughran. ""Death sentences are known to be used as a tool against the political opposition,"" she said. ""The number of grossly unfair trials is shocking and an especially serious concern in cases where the death penalty is handed down."" In 2009, Jammeh made a similar threat to resume executions, but did not act on it, Amnesty said. Nonetheless, the new threat raises concern in the nation, the group said. The former British colony is surrounded by Senegal and has a population of 1.3 million. Jammeh took power in a military coup in 1994, and was elected president two years later.

"(CNN) -- Tomas Berdych may have upset World No.1 Novak Djokovic but found Rafael Nadal an altogether tougher proposition in the semifinals of the Rome Masters Saturday. Nadal was at his impeccable best to sweep aside the big-hitting Czech 6-2 6-4 to reach his eighth straight ATP Tour final since returning to action in February after a long-term injury. He will face his long-time rival Roger Federer after the Swiss ended the hopes of France's Benoit Paire with a 7-6 6-4 win in the second semifinal. Berdych's defeat of Djokovic in the quarters would have done wonders for his confidence, but it took precisely one game for a reality check to set in. Nadal came out firing on all cylinders to break his opponent immediately and he was never headed. The crowd at the Foro Italico were treated to a clay court exhibition, particularly in the first set as the 26-year-old Spaniard broke Berdych a second time to rub it in. The second set was closer and Berdych, who broke Djokovic's service as the Serbian served for the match in the previous round, gave himself a glimmer of hope by holding fast to four games apiece. But he was broken for a third time as Nadal stepped up a gear before wrapping up his passage to the final. ""He starts really well and, of course, it's Rafa and we know how he plays on clay,"" Berdych told the official ATP Tour website. ""It was a good start for him. Yesterday I had one chance that I did take and I won, and today I had one chance that I didn't take and I lost."" Nadal had achieved the incredible feat of winning all 100% of points after his second service as he made it 13 straight wins on the tour over the unfortunate Berdych. He will be heavy favorite to win his 24th Masters 1,000 crown Sunday before heading to Paris for his defense of the French Open crown. ""The first set was fantastic,"" Nadal said. ""I played at a high level and everything went well with no mistakes. I was dominating the points and following to the net. I think I played one of my best matches since I am came back."" Federer, who has been in fine form in Rome, was given a stern test by Paire, particularly in the first set, but used his experience to good effect to set up a repeat of his 2006 final in the Italian capital against Nadal. Earlier, women's World No. 1 Serena Williams ended the hopes of Romanian qualifier Simona Halep with a routine 6-3 6-0 win in their semifinal. 15-time grand slam champion Williams is on a 23-game winning streak and will look to extend that against No.3 seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus. The American is 32-1 on clay since last year -- her only loss against Virginie Razzano at Roland Garros last year. ""I don't know if I feel better on clay this year or last year,"" Williams told the WTA Tour website. ""I felt great last year and I feel great this year too. I love playing on clay and have done very well on it, even at Roland Garros."" Azarenka beat Italian seventh seed 6-0 7-5 Sara Errani in their last four clash.","Rafael Nadal reaches eighth straight final since his comeback .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams came from a set down against Maria Sharapova to win the Miami Masters for a record sixth time on Saturday. After a slow start, the world No.1 sprang into life in stunning fashion, winning the last 10 games of the match to eventually prevail 4-6 6-3 6-0. Williams' win -- the 48th of her career -- means she surpasses the previous all-time title mark that she jointly held with Germany's Steffi Graf. ""Maria definitely pushed me -- she did a really great job today,"" Williams said, WTATennis.com reported. ""I look forward to our next matches -- it's going to be really fun for the fans and for us and for everyone."" The match was turned on its head in the sixth game of the second set with Sharapova serving at 3-2. Williams won the game to love before streaking away with the set and the match. Williams joins Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf and Chris Evert as only the fourth player ever to win any WTA event six times. Defeat for Sharapova means she has now finished runner-up for three successive years in Miami and five times in all. ""It's disappointing to end it like this but Serena played a great match, and I'm sure we'll play a few more times this year,"" Sharapova said, WTATennis.com reported.","Serena Williams claims a record sixth Miami Masters title beating Maria Sharapova in three sets .

"London (CNN) -- The Duchess of Cambridge has been photographed furtively once again: An Italian magazine announced Tuesday it will publish vacation photos of the pregnant royal and her baby bump, despite her objection. The magazine, Chi, said Tuesday that it will print ""extraordinary images of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their dream holiday in the Caribbean"" in the issue coming out Wednesday. ""The future mum, now in her fourth month of pregnancy, wears a small bikini that enhances her now visible bump,"" the magazine said. St. James's Palace -- which represents Catherine, her husband, Prince William, and his brother, Harry -- responded with dismay. ""We are disappointed that photographs of the Duke and Duchess on a private holiday look likely to be published overseas,"" a palace representative said. ""This is a clear breach of the couple's right to privacy."" It was not immediately clear when or exactly where the pictures were taken. British and U.S. media -- including People, like CNN a division of Time Warner -- reported that the royal couple recently vacationed on the secluded Caribbean isle of Mustique. The Duchess, whose maiden name is Kate Middleton, has kept a low profile since the announcement in December she is set to give birth to her first child in July. Images showing any evidence of a baby bump have been hard to come by in that time. The Chi photos, though, are not her first encounter with paparazzi -- which tracked her during her long courtship with William, their engagement and their time since April 2011 as a married couple. The highest-profile example came in September 2012, when the French magazine Closer ran photographs of Catherine privately sunbathing topless while on a holiday with William in France. Besides that magazine, some of those photos also were published in the Irish Daily Star newspaper and Chi, which according to its parent company Mondadori is a women's magazine with an average circulation of more than 218,000 and a readership well beyond that. Soon after the photos came out, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took legal action against Closer -- which was fined by a French court and ordered not to distribute the edition in print or online. It was also told to hand over the photos to the royals. CNN's Susannah Palk reported this story from London, and Greg Botelho wrote it from Atlanta. CNN's Gisella Deputato contributed to this report.","The Italian magazine, Chi, says it will print photos of the Duchess of Cambridge on holiday .

"(CNN) -- It's not surprising that at a town meeting this week, Middleborough, Massachusetts, voted 183-50 to impose a $20 fine for swearing in public. Who's not for civic virtue? Enough is enough. And so on. Plus the ban doesn't apply to what people do ""in private."" But it's an empty, hopeless move. Not to mention plain backward. For one, it's like trying put out a fire with an eyedropper. The police cannot monitor most public activities. Say they pass out some fines to teens waiting in line for a concert. Still, those offended by their language will be endlessly assaulted with it when passing the same teens as they walk down unpatrolled streets, or chat before a movie starts, or, basically, just exist. Overheard on CNN.com: What the $%#;!? Choice words for town's profanity fine . Besides, the fines will only create the kind of resentment that makes it feel sexy to rebel. Nothing will feel more authentic to the Middleborough teen than to haul off with a few epithets when no police are in view -- but plenty of other citizens are. And all we have to do is wait for the cleverer ones to claim that certain uses of the words aren't really profanity, which will mean messy cases of where-do-you-draw-the-line. Is hell in ""It was so from hell that he called me"" a curse word? Or, if someone says something is ""f------ awesome,"" is that profanity? Remember how at one point even the Federal Communications Commission, based on that reasoning, let Bono get by with saying that winning an award was ""really, really f---- brilliant"" at the Golden Globes ceremony in 2003? Americans need to rethink what is considered profanity in 2012. We are taught that a certain collection of words is profane, but this no longer makes sense given the readiness with which even the most mild-mannered of Americans use such words. Sure, there are an especially careful few among us who rarely use them. But they are exceptions. Most of us chuckle that it was considered a big deal for Clark Gable to say ""damn"" in ""Gone With the Wind"" -- or that a newspaper wouldn't have allowed me to use that word in print. Or take a sentence like ""We've got to get all of this stuff out of the garage."" How many of us can honestly say that there isn't an alternate word we would quite possibly use for ""stuff""? And a lot? What our great-grandparents considered profanity is, for us, merely colorful. We teach our kids not to use it -- but are hardly surprised that they start doing so later. The characters on HBO's ""Girls"" curse like sailors, and yet we can assume that their parents were telling them in the '90s not to use bad words -- while using them themselves, as we have heard the mother of the show's lead, Hannah, do already. We are an informal society. We dress scantily compared with earlier Americans. We talk openly about sex and excretion in a way that still shocks our grandparents. We cherish the ""real."" Our sense of profanity lags behind our reality. Now, don't get me wrong -- we do have genuine profanity. The N-word and the one beginning with C that refers to a female body part are the main curses today. These are truly taboo, in the sense an anthropologist studying us would recognize. To haul off with these words is to leave one's moral legitimacy in question. Note, however, that one cannot even shield one's children from the N-word. It decorates their favorite music, rap, and not just the raunchier strains. Kanye West's eternally infectious ""Golddigger"" hit enshrines it in its very chorus, for example. Or, a friend of mine, white, recently told me that her boys are attending a mostly black public school and making a lot of friends -- but also picking up their way of using the N-word as a marker of fellowship. So, let's fine them $20 for embracing diversity? It's hard to see what the benefits of an ordinance such as Middleborough's will be. The smidgen less that people will hear profanity on Main Street will transform the linguistic environment about as much as a cold drink makes you think it isn't actually hot. Or is the idea that the ordinance will nevertheless get an idea in the air, in the way that smoking gradually became uncool and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg hopes will happen with massive sugary drinks? Unlikely. Young people don't model their language usage on what they hear at the shoe store. They will pick up the lingo from music, YouTube, Facebook and texting -- not to mention their own parents talking about that, um, stuff in the garage. Our job is to teach children that certain words are not to be used until a certain age, and even then, with care. That has worked pretty well for a long time after all. As for the fact that we hear the words in public more than we used to, I suggest we bring our sense of ""dirty"" into line with the rest of our modern come-as-you-are American spirits. Or if we can't see it that way, we might just accept teens' potty mouths the way we do cracks in the pavement and overripe trash cans -- inevitable dings in this thing called life. Let's face it: In 2012, an ordinance against public profanity is like fining people for burping. What kind of priority is this in an age when so many more urgent issues face us all? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John McWhorter.","John McWhorter: A town's recent ban on public swearing is a hopeless cause .

"(CNN) -- Malaysian fighter jets and soldiers on Tuesday waged an offensive against a group of armed invaders from the Philippines, who have staked a claim to a remote part of the island of Borneo, authorities said. Previous efforts by Malaysian police to turn the men back had ended in deadly clashes. The group of Filipino men, believed to number between 100 and 300, arrived three weeks ago on the east coast of the Malaysian state of Sabah, on Borneo, demanding to be recognized as representatives of a sultanate that used to rule the area. Malaysian authorities initially tried to persuade the men to return peacefully to their homes in the nearby southern Philippines. But the intruders refused to budge, and the standoff turned violent in recent days as clashes in the region reportedly left nine Malaysian police officers and 19 intruders dead. ""Our security forces were attacked and killed. Malaysians, particularly those in Sabah, are worried about their safety,"" Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said in a statement carried by the national news agency Bernama announcing the offensive Tuesday. The standoff has touched on an unresolved territorial issue between the Philippines and Malaysia, as well as Manila's efforts to improve relations with Islamic insurgents in the country's south after decades of violence. The Malaysian operation Tuesday morning in Lahad Datu, the district in Sabah where the Filipino men had come ashore, involved an air raid by F-18 and Hawk fighter jets followed by mortar fire and a ground assault by soldiers, Bernama reported. The security forces ""achieved their objective,"" the news agency cited Tan Sri Ismail Omar, the head of the Malaysian Police, as saying without elaborating on what exactly the goal had been. No members of the Malaysian forces were hurt in the attack, and the casualties on the Filipino side had yet to be determined, he said. But representatives of the Filipino group didn't report any initial losses from the offensive, saying the Malaysian jets had dropped bombs at a location they had occupied previously. Filipino group on Borneo claims to represent sultanate, Malaysia says . 'The Royal Army' The Filipino men have called themselves the Royal Army of the Sultanate of Sulu, a former Islamic power in the region that once controlled parts of the Philippines and Borneo. Its influence has since faded, and it is now a clan in the poor, restive southern Philippines. The sultanate's leadership has been riven by internal power struggles in recent decades, but the squabbling family members appear to have united in the decision to send their followers to Sabah, a move that has alarmed Malaysians and complicated efforts by the Philippines to pursue peace talks with Muslim rebels in its southern islands. Abraham Idjirani, a spokesman for one of the sultanate's leaders in Manila, said the armed the Filipino men reported hearing shots being fired nearby, but had so far suffered no casualties. Idjirani blamed Malaysian authorities for the escalation of the standoff, saying they had fired the first shots in the clash that took place between the two sides on Friday. He added that a woman and family members of Sabah residents had been killed in that skirmish. He also claimed that other people in the region were joining the sultanate's followers in the fight against the Malaysian forces but was unable to provide details. ""We don't know who they are, but they are there,"" he said. Since the crisis began, Philippine authorities have urged the sultanate's followers to lay down their arms and return home. ""From the very start, our objective has been to avoid the loss of lives and the shedding of blood,"" President Benigno Aquino III said at the weekend. ""If you have grievances, the path you chose was wrong. The just, and indeed, the only correct thing for you to do is to surrender."" Excluded from a peace deal . The Sabah standoff has its roots in a recent landmark peace deal between Manila and Muslim rebels, according to Julkipli Wadi, the dean of the Institute of Islamic Studies at the University of the Philippines. The members of the sultanate's royal family seem to have felt isolated by the provisional accord signed in October by the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has fought for decades to establish an independent Islamic state in southern Philippines, Wadi said last month. The sultanate has succeeded in grabbing the attention of Philippine and Malaysian authorities. But the resulting violence makes the outcome of the situation unclear. Established in the 15th century, the Sultanate of Sulu became an Islamic power center in Southeast Asia that at one point ruled Sabah. But the encroachment of Western colonial powers, followed by the emergence of the Philippines and Malaysia as independent nation states, steadily eroded the sultanate's power, according to Wadi. It became ""a sultanate without a kingdom"" to rule over, he said. Sulu is now a province within the Republic of the Philippines. The economic, cultural and historical links between Sabah and the nearby Philippines islands, as well as the porous nature of the border between the two, means that many of the sultanate's followers have friends and relatives in Lahad Datu. And the historical connection still fuels tensions between Malaysia and the Philippines, with Manila retaining a ""dormant claim"" to Sabah through the Sultanate of Sulu, according to the CIA World Factbook. The Philippines claims much of the eastern part of Sabah, which was leased to the British North Borneo Company in 1878 by the Sultanate of Sulu. In 1963, Britain transferred Sabah to Malaysia, a move that the sultanate claimed was a breach of the 1878 deal. Malaysia still pays a token rent to the sultanate for the lease of Sabah.

"(RollingStone.com) -- Rage Against the Machine's 1992 debut is a grenade that keeps exploding. Among '90s albums, only ""Nevermind"" and ""The Chronic"" rival it for cultural impact. Rage made hip-hop-tinged funk metal the new rebel music, taking over the alienation beat from grunge slackers and making Marxist sloganeering seem badass. Like any good revolutionary sect, the band members weren't without their contradictions and tensions. Zack de la Rocha's blocky, academically aspirational rhymes preached leftist revolution, and guitarist and sonic architect Tom Morello practiced an almost authoritarian control and extreme technical precision as he mimicked sampling, sent down thunderous power chords and, occasionally, indulged in almost New Age-y solos. (See the liquid note-bending on ""Township Rebellion."") RollingStone.com: Rage Against the Machine box set marks 20th anniversary of first LP . Remastered to museum-clean standards, the reissued album comes with DVDs of live shows and music videos, plus demos that prove just how down and detailed the group had every song (even if Morello still couldn't resist changing solos). The rap appropriation has lost the force of novelty, of course, but blaming Rage Against the Machine for Fred Durst is like blaming Abraham Lincoln for John Boehner. RollingStone.com: 500 greatest albums of all time . De la Rocha's throat-scraping eruptions about suicide (the fate of an outcast in ""Settle for Nothing"") and bullets in the head feel as primal as any lefty rock -- and maybe more so, heard from inside Morello's palace of sound.

"London (CNN) -- In public Buckingham Palace are putting on a brave face, insisting the queen's illness is little more than a stomach bug and her hospitalization merely a ""precautionary measure."" But behind the castle walls there is cause for concern. The main worry is dehydration, quite common for anyone suffering from gastroenteritis; usually it is treated by replacing lost bodily fluids with water. Five things to know about gastroenteritis . But the queen is finding it difficult to keep any fluids down. For this reason she was taken to the Edward 7th hospital in London, the first time she has been in hospital for 10 years, where she is currently hooked up to an IV drip. Buckingham Palace have canceled all the queen's official engagements for the next week, including a high profile visit to Rome. Senior advisers have spoken of their concerns to the Prince of Wales and it is believed the queen, who is 87 next month, will be asked to take things easier over the coming months. Though the queen is always described as being in ""robust"" health, her advisers are acutely aware there will come a point when she has to slow down. For this reason the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall have been taking on far more high profile engagements recently as they prepare for the day they will formally replace the queen. A source inside Windsor Castle said: ""Charles and Camilla have subtlety created a more regal air over the past year and are beginning to look, and act, like a King and Queen in waiting. Behind them the ever-popular William and Catherine have now progressed to being senior members of the royal family. ""If the queen is convinced to cut back on the amount of engagements she carried out she will do so with the knowledge the family 'firm' is well taken care of behind her.""

"(CNN) -- With the selection of Cardinal Jorge Maria Bergoglio, who will be known as Pope Francis, the cardinals have sent a signal to the Church about how Catholics should live in the world. Bergoglio is known to be a good administrator. But he lives very simply in a small apartment and rides a bus. He's well known for his engagement in issues of social justice and in defense of the poor. Indeed, the very name Francis honors St. Francis of Assisi, a person of humility and deep caring. If he is anything like his namesake then this selection is good news indeed. And now that he has been named pope, Francis will face a raft of advice. Some will call for improved administration, finding a way to draw new Catholics into the church where it is in decline, and increasing engagement with other faith traditions. Opinion: The biggest moment in the world . Other pundits were thinking in grand terms. Among the progressives, some believe the church should adopt a bold revolution, with new acceptance of women priests, homosexuality, etc. The Cubs have a greater chance of winning a World Series. Change on controversial issues, if it happens at all, will be slow and incremental, since the church is bound by the requirements of tradition and precedent. From the traditional side of Catholicism, expressed in a Wall Street Journal column by George Weigel, hope was for a pope who will be ""a charismatic, missionary culture warrior, challenging the world's democracies to rebuild their moral foundations."" The problem here is that in the United States many of the troops are not following the generals. For example, 90% of Catholics are using contraception and 82% think it is morally permissible. Moreover, many American Catholics are more devoted to liberal and conservative political positions than the teachings of the church. This poses a serious problem. The church has conservative positions on human sexuality, bioethics, etc., but liberal positions on issues such as economic regulation, the death penalty and immigration. A church divided against itself seems unlikely to renew our political or cultural structures. News: Cardinals elect first pope from Latin America . So, in lieu of grand but seemingly unworkable schemes, I would suggest a much more modest but doable set of proposals to address a spiritual crisis of declining confidence in the institutional church. In a recent Pew Foundation survey of Catholics in the United States, almost half listed the issues needing to be addressed in the church as the priest sex abuse scandal and a loss of trust. What can the church do to resolve the trust problem? Why not begin a transparency and empowerment offensive? Transparency could be improved by placing in the Vatican Catholic lay experts in charge of the priest abuse investigations. Trust will not be restored by clerics investigating and judging clerics. We end up with Cardinal Bernard Law, who moved and protected pedophile priests, being granted a position of honor in Rome. These kinds of decisions have seriously eroded trust in the pews. In the United States, the Catholic Church finally awakened and began a process of lay review. A female judge and lay investigators restored a degree of trust. Bring this model to Rome. Opinion: Pope Francis, humble, authentic and credible . Eliminating the Vatican Bank, a source of scandals for many decades, would increase transparency and institutional focus. The church is better with the deposit of faith than the faith of deposits. Turn the funds over to reliable banks subject to international regulatory requirements. Resolving these transparency issues is based in part on empowering the laity for a greater role. And there are other empowerment possibilities. The church could allow more flexibility to local bishops and parishes, who can respond creatively to local conditions. In a global church, this will assist effective evangelization. And why not have women deacons? This would add more personnel for critical church functions in locations without sufficient priests. It would ensure greater access to the sacraments and bring an often-alienated constituency into a critical role offering new gifts to the administration of the church. Another role for women could be an advisory board to the pontiff on the role of women and women's issues in the church. These proposals for transparency and empowerment are realistic ways to restore faith, hope and charity in the administration of the church. They would allow the church to pursue its spiritual mission more effectively and more fully use the gifts of its female members. These proposals can succeed because they will not require a radical change in theology, tradition or canon law. They require no major shift in doctrine. I have one final suggestion to restore hope and trust. The church, starting with the example of Pope Francis, must embody the virtue of humility. It must listen as well as preach. Consider also the example of Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, who does not own a car and eats with workers. His words match his humble lifestyle. He has said, ""(You) may be saying the right things but people will not listen if the manner by which you communicate reminds them of a triumphalistic, know-it-all institution."" Amen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Phillip M. Thomson.","Phillip Thompson: The new pope will be getting much advice .
He says the pope should build trust, introduce new transparency on range of issues .
He says put lay experts in charge of sex abuse probe, eliminate Vatican Bank .

"(CNN) -- There's yet another way to post writing and photos and share them with other people online. Medium is a new blogging tool for people who feel constrained by Twitter and overwhelmed by Blogger or Tumblr. Currently only in preview mode, the project is getting attention because of its founders' impressive pedigree. Evan Williams and Biz Stone co-founded Twitter and Blogger, so they know about blogging, both long and short form. Medium is the latest product out of their Obvious Corporation, which incubated Twitter in its early days, and the duo has a grand vision for the blogging tool, elucidated in a long announcement post by Williams. ""We're re-imagining publishing in an attempt to make an evolutionary leap, based on everything we've learned in the last 13 years and the needs of today's world,"" says Williams in the post. For a project that is ""rethinking"" publishing, the first go is a blogging platform that recycles many of the best features already at work on other sites -- Pinterest, Tumblr, Blogger, Reddit -- and ties it heavily into Twitter. The design is like a minimalist Tumblr or WordPress theme. Posts can be just a large photo, words or a combination. They are organized into collections, like Pinterest, and can be sorted by popularity based on votes from the community, like Reddit and Digg (there's also an option to view by newest first). Clicking on a person's name doesn't take you to a landing page that shows you all their posts. Rather, you're whisked away to their Twitter profile, where you can scan for links to Medium posts they've created. Perhaps following specific people isn't the point of Medium; at its heart are the collections which allow you to explore content by topic. Current collections include the photo-based ""When I Was a Kid,"" a bunch of first-person stories titled ""This Happened to Me"" and ""I.M.H.O.,"" a selection of editorial pieces on everything from Groupon to socialism. The goal of Medium doesn't appear to be revolutionizing how content is shared, but to boost the quality of the content itself, according to its founders. ""Lots of services have successfully lowered the bar for sharing information, but there's been less progress toward raising the quality of what's produced,"" says Williams. Medium gives people space to go deeper than is allowed by Twitter's 140-character limit, but there's no pressure to post regularly or have a branded presence. Voting and collections put the emphasis on surfacing the best content from a mass of people, organizing them into subject-oriented pages like sections of a newspaper. Users can wax poetic about their hopes and dreams ""without the burden of becoming a blogger or worrying about developing an audience,"" says Williams. Posting privileges are limited to a chosen few for the time being, but anyone can make an account, using their Twitter handle, to browse and vote on posts. The first incarnation of Medium seems familiar and a little mundane, but hopefully it's just a starting point for this team of experienced blogging and content veterans. ""We're just starting the journey of figuring out what all that means, and what we're releasing today is just a sliver of what we've figured out,"" said Williams.","Twitter co-founders unveil a new minimalist blogging platform called Medium .

"Washington (CNN) -- Lina Stauffenberg stood on a corner outside the U.S. Supreme Court on a brilliant but unseasonably chilly early spring day and defined marriage as that between a man and a woman. ""A father and a mother is best for children,"" she said. Laura De Nardis and Deborah Smith stood arm-in-arm near the same spot. ""We want equality under the law,"" De Nardis said unequivocally as she wrapped an arm around her partner. 5 things we learned from the justices . Stauffenberg, De Nardis and Smith not only stood apart literally, but also sharply illustrated the divide making history inside the high court -- the question of whether same-sex marriage can be prohibited under the law. As the justices weighed legal arguments over an appeal of California's same-sex marriage ban, demonstrators packed sidewalks around the ornate Supreme Court building. They were jammed shoulder to shoulder as speeches rang out from a makeshift stage. Demonstrators from both sides pumped their fists waved homemade signs. Some broke into chants while others led a small parade that snaked between the crowd. The mood was festive overall. Police cleared the roads and maintained access to the court but otherwise kept a low profile. Grass ringing the court grounds was trampled to mud, which covered the sidewalk. Shoeprints were everywhere. The public sentiment outside the marble court seemed to mirror recent polling showing a growing awareness around the issue, and stronger support for same-sex marriage specifically. A decision that could change America . According to the CNN/ORC International survey, 57% say they have a family member or close friend who is gay or lesbian, up 12 points from 2007. Also, the number of Americans who support same-sex marriage has risen by almost the same amount over the same period - from 40% in 2007 to 53%. ""It's time that gay and lesbian couples have the same rights as straight couples,"" says said Olga Liapis-Muzzy, who was outside the court with her partner of three years, Emily Gosnell. Some of those gathered recognized a momentous event. ""It's a historic day. I want to be a part of history,"" said Scott Nelson, a New Jersey history teacher who arrived at the Supreme Court at 2 a.m. Someone yells to same-sex marriage supporters: ""What do we want?"" They respond: ""Equality!"" The person again implores: ""When do we want it?"" ""Now!"" is the answer. Same-sex marriage opponents were vocal, too. Hear and read the arguments in full . Chris Simon of Maryland owns a detailing company, and held a sign that read: ""Say No to Same-Sex Marriage."" ""I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. This is the way God planned it.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is drafting new plans to hold suspected terrorists without trial indefinitely but allow them to challenge their imprisonment periodically, a White House official said Tuesday. A proposed executive order would cover prisoners who can't be tried in civilian courts or before the military commissions set up at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official provided few details, since the draft had not yet been presented to President Barack Obama. But the official said Obama had pledged in May 2009 to give suspected terrorists some recourse. ""We must have clear, defensible and lawful standards for those who fall in this category,"" Obama said in a 2009 speech at the National Archives. ""We must have fair procedures so that we don't make mistakes. We must have a thorough process of periodic review, so that any prolonged detention is carefully evaluated and justified."" The Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that captives held at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay could challenge their detention. But the decision gave no specific guidelines on how often accused terrorists could make their claims. The latest proposal could be aimed at securing political support for the Obama administration as it ponders whether to bring top al Qaeda figures such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused architect of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, to the United States for trial in a civilian court.","Draft order would give suspects a chance to challenge their detention .

"(CNN) -- If you saw Joseph Gordon-Levitt in ""Premium Rush"" or ""The Dark Knight Rises"" this summer, you will be surprised at how different he looks in ""Looper,"" a hit-man thriller with a time travel conceit. Gordon-Levitt looks older and more mature somehow: with a high forehead, a more pronounced nose and a way of pursing his lips in a faintly ironic scowl. The reasons for his makeover become apparent when his character, Joe, comes face to face with his older self, played by Bruce Willis: higher forehead, same nose, same scowl. It's enough to put even the sharpest hit man (or ""looper"") off his aim. And Old Joe gets away, which is a problem, because if Young Joe doesn't rectify the situation and fulfill his contract, he won't qualify for the 30-year retirement plan that's allowed Old Joe such a long and fruitful life. They'll both be cut off in their prime. The first film in four years from ""Brick"" and ""Brothers Bloom"" writer-director Rian Johnson, ""Looper"" is a smart suspense movie. It's essentially a low-tech variation on themes from ""The Terminator"" but ingenious enough to feel fresh, intriguing and even bewildering at times. Most flicks are so predictable, you could set your watch by them ... if you still had a watch (Joe has a silver pocket watch, but he's a slave to retro fashion). Johnson adopts an arrestingly bold and unusual structure, introducing two major characters an hour in and employing telekinesis when it seems the time travel thing is getting old. But his readiness to make us stretch should not blind us to the fact that ""Looper"" is full of holes: time holes, holes for corpse disposal, and enough plot holes to fill a leaky bucket. It is set, confusingly, 30 years from now, in a low-budget future that looks like a more broken down version of our present (give or take a few flying motor vehicles). Time travel has not been invented, but in another 30 years, it will be -- that is, in 2070 -- and the Mob has taken to sending their marked men back in time to be dispatched by loopers and disposed of in Joe's less-regimented present. Confused? You will be. It doesn't matter. It doesn't even matter that nobody thought to make Gordon-Levitt's earlobes resemble Willis' (if you've seen ""The Imposter,"" you'll know that's a dead giveaway). It's fun being flummoxed, and Johnson has a knack for pulling off short, snappy scenes that keep the drama percolating (the excellent supporting cast, including Emily Blunt, Jeff Daniels and Noah Segan, also helps). Yes, it's a B movie sci-fi thriller, but not many prestige pictures have this much going on underneath the surface.","""Looper"" is a hit-man thriller with a time travel conceit .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Several hundred union and other progressive activists sought to capitalize on the growing ""Occupy Wall Street"" protests Wednesday, holding a rally on Capitol Hill to demand new public spending on job creation and an end to federal budget cuts. The rally, led by former White House clean energy adviser Van Jones, highlighted growing liberal frustration with a public policy agenda increasingly dominated by deficit reduction efforts as opposed to more traditional economic stimulus measures. A number of progressive Democrats are hoping to use the growing protests on Wall Street and elsewhere to energize the party's base in advance of the 2012 elections. They are also hoping to build new momentum for President Barack Obama's stalled $447 billion jobs bill. Jobs bill sparks tense Senate exchange . ""The progressive movement is on the upswing,"" declared Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minnesota. ""We are not going to stop. We are going to get the justice we deserve."" The boisterous crowd responded with a series of chants, including ""What's disgusting? Union busting!"" and ""Hey hey, ho ho, Speaker Boehner's got to go."" Linda Evans, an unemployed home health care provider from Washington, pleaded for Congress to do more to reduce unemployment. ""I come from a proud family. I'm a proud woman,"" she said. ""I want to make a difference. ... Give us a chance. Fight for us. We're the ones who put you in office."" Mahlon Mitchell, head of the Professional Firefighters of Wisconsin, complained that ""we see Wall Street flourishing right now"" while other Americans continue to struggle with the economic downturn. ""They got us into this mess. I say it's their job to get us out of this mess. ... It's time for us to stand up,"" he said. The ""real problem,"" he asserted, is the ""deregulation of banking"" and Wall Street. Overheard: Banks not getting the message . Mitchell mocked GOP attempts to call the wealthiest Americans ""job creators"" who would be forced to lay off more workers if their taxes are increased. In the past, he said, ""we called (these people) robber barons."" ""We didn't start this fight,"" Mitchell declared. ""But it's the fight they want (and) it's the fight they're going to get."" Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Arizona, insisted liberal leaders are not trying to create a counterweight to the conservative economic populism of the tea party. ""This is not an answer to the tea party,"" he asserted. ""This is not about hate. This is not about fear. This is not about division."" It's an effort to ""restore democracy to this nation.""

"(CNN)  -- Her smiling face is broadcast to more than 20 million Americans each month -- yet Victoria Osteen still acts like your small-town Texan neighbor. She makes sure to ask how you're doing and what you did for the holidays before getting down to anything business-related. ""I know the people I've talked to are really valuing what they have right now,"" Victoria Osteen said. As co-pastor of Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas, with her husband, Joel, Victoria Osteen is an inspiration and mentor to many. Her first book, ""Love Your Life: Living Happy, Healthy and Whole,"" offers busy, distressed women advice on embracing joy. And her newly released children's books (""Unexpected Treasures"" and ""My Happy Heart Books"") aim to help kids develop their character and friendships. ""You know, books are such a great way to spend time with your children, open lines of communication with your children, and just build that strong foundation,"" she said. CNN talked with Victoria Osteen about the uncertain economy, common financial sins, and why encouragement is so important. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: Your first book was released in October. Why did you write it? Who were you hoping to inspire? Victoria Osteen: I've talked to so many people after the last 10 years, and I just found that there was a kind of thread that ran through every conversation. Relationships are people's No. 1 priorities. They want to have good relationships and a lot of times they don't. Even in these uncertain times, these economic uncertainties, we have to be able to develop our relationships and our support systems. So I addressed a lot of those issues, and just gave practical advice from my life and people I've talked to. So I just hoped to inspire people to just realize their influence, their value, and the fact that they can get even more out of their relationships and enjoy them. CNN: Have you heard many stories about these difficult economic times? Osteen: It's interesting, because we get so much uncertainty and get so stressed out, and I know the people I've talked to are really valuing what they have right now. And they're starting with their relationships, with their children, with family. They're saying, ""I want to focus on them, I don't want to be so distracted in what's going on that I can't spend time with my family."" And I think that's what happens to us. We go through hard times and difficulties and those things seem to pass. But our relationships are there for a lifetime. In times like this, we need each other and we need to support one another and encourage one another. We all need encouragement so it's good to have that strong support system. CNN: How is religion affected in times like these? ... Do more people turn to God for hope? Or do they get discouraged because he's not doing enough? Osteen: You know, sometimes I think these difficult situations can bring us back to what is important and maybe do some things that we should have done before in our life. I find that people are coming back to their faith. They're depending on it, and they want to rediscover what's important. So I really think there's a lot of hope and a lot of encouragement out there. And people are wanting to say, you know, ""We're going to get through these tough times, too."" And their faith is a key here, it really is. CNN: What are the main financial ""sins"" you see? What do people do over and over again that they could do better? Osteen: I think we could all do better sometimes of not overextending ourselves as much. It's easy in our day and age to just extend ourselves in the credit line and things like that, but this [economic time] I think will bring people back -- ""You know, I need to live within my means and be kind of careful with my money."" CNN: Do you have any advice for those that are suffering with personal finances or job loss? Osteen: I would just encourage them to reach into their faith and reach out to God and to keep their family around them. I mean, I just think that is so important to keep a strong support system, to keep yourself encouraged. You know, when you get down and discouraged, you don't see any hope in a situation -- it doesn't help you rise above it. And another thing ... extend our hand to someone else. You might not be able to help financially, but you can help someone maybe by just babysitting their children while they go on a job interview or, you know, just doing the simple things to get outside your own self and your own needs. Sometimes in need, when you reach out and meet someone else's need, it's amazing how it can change the atmosphere around you. CNN: You travel around the country, spreading an uplifting message. How does it affect you to always have to be the positive one? Do you ever get tired of that or feel like things are bringing you down? Osteen: Well, you know we all have to keep ourselves encouraged. I have to encourage myself every day because when you look at what's going on, you can just look down and say, ""What's happening?"" You know, you can let fear attach itself to you and fear is contagious -- when you get around it, it just seems to build on itself. The thing about it is that I've seen God do so many miracles for so many people. I talk to people everyday who this lord of encouragement has helped them stay above it all, so they can make good decisions. God can lead them in a better direction. So because I've seen God do so many great things, it just helps me to say, ""Stay encouraged"" and ""You can do it, don't give up."" Because God's faithful, and I think that's what helps me continue to encourage other people.","Victoria Osteen is co-pastor of Lakewood Church with husband, Joel Osteen .

"Deauville, France (CNN) -- Leymah Gbowee, the Liberian activist who last year won the Nobel Peace Prize, says she is disappointed with fellow winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberia's president, and believes laureates need to do more to spread the message of peace. ""I think there should be more required of us by the committee ... in terms of preaching the message,"" said Gbowee, who shared the 2011 prize with Johnson Sirleaf and Yemeni activist Tawakkol Karman. Read more: Three women's rights activists share Nobel Peace Prize . All Nobel laureates should come together, particularly Peace Prize winners, ""to really sit down and talk about the impact we're making on the world,"" she told CNN in an interview at the 8th Edition of the Women's Forum Global Meeting in France. Gbowee is a member of the Nobel Women's Initiative, established in 2006 by among others the late Wangari Maathai, which supports women's rights globally. Over the years, the Norwegian Nobel Committee's Peace Prize awards have come under scrutiny. Critics have questioned their choices and politics. Read more: African women look within for change . Many saw the award given to U.S. President Barack Obama in 2009, during the first year of his presidency, as premature. Many also question the fact that Indian leader Gandhi never received the prize, despite a number of nominations. This year's winner will be announced Friday. Gbowee is credited with helping to end Liberia's civil war in 2003 by leading women in non-violent protest, including organizing ""sex strikes."" This week, the outspoken and charismatic campaigner publicly criticized fellow laureate Johnson Sirleaf for failing to fight corruption and nepotism in Liberia. ""Let down by her, I won't say 100%, but on certain issues, yes,"" Gbowee said. Gbowee, who helped Johnson Sirleaf get reelected to a second term last year, asked why the Liberian president's three sons all have lucrative government posts. She called for Johnson Sirleaf, who became Africa's first elected female head of state in 2005, to make one of her sons step down from his job as chairman of the state-owned National Oil Company (NOCAL). ""The public (in Liberia) has spoken, these are the people who voted for (Johnson Sirleaf),"" she said of the outcry in Liberia over the appointment. Read more: Making it as a female movie mogul in Hollywood . Gbowee also resigned as head of the country's reconciliation commission after less than a year because of her concerns. Gbowee acknowledges that Johnson Sirleaf has made progress during her time in office, particularly in building infrastructure and reducing debt in the war-scarred nation. Liberia is one of the world's poorest and least developed countries. Fourteen years of conflict from 1989 to 2003 left an estimated 250,000 dead. But Gbowee says if Johnson Sirleaf does not ""put her foot down (on corruption) ... it's really going to hurt not just her but future women's leadership in Liberia."" Gbowee describes winning the Nobel Peace Prize as a great platform for raising awareness of her work on peace and education. Gbowee is the head of the Ghana-based Women Peace and Security Network (WPSN) and has recently launched a foundation that funds Liberian girls through college. So far, she says, the foundation has helped 30 girls. She says she was under no illusions when she won the prize that it would translate into extra funding for her projects. ""Being a woman, and being African -- those are two things that ... make raising funds very difficult for peace work,"" she said. Read more: Words of wisdom from women of power . While she has yet to come to terms with the celebrity that accompanies winning the prize, Gbowee says the essence of what she does is still working in the community. ""What I do is not to be all red carpet and glam and cams ... when it becomes necessary to come on the red carpet, I should have a message from down there to bring to the red carpet."" Her skills and profile beg the question of whether she has ambitions in the political arena. Gbowee wouldn't rule out running for political office in Liberia but said that she's still young. ""I'm just 40. How can I translate this gift of a Nobel into a better life for girls on the continent of Africa in general and Liberia in particular? That's the quest that I'm on right now.""","Activist Leymah Gbowee shared 2011 prize with Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf .

"(CNN) -- Four scuba divers drowned after a routine trip to a popular underwater cave system in southern Italy went horribly wrong over the weekend, according to the coast guard. The party of divers lost their way while trying to find the exit from the ""Blood Grotto,"" a red-walled cave near the tourist port of Palinuro on Italy's southwest coast on Saturday. The divers became disoriented after kicking up mud and sand from the floor while trying to find a way out -- and instead entered a nearby tunnel which led four of the divers to a dead end, where the coast guard says their bodies were found. Massimo Ruggiero, the coast guard commander, confirmed to CNN that the victims were Greek-born Panaiotis Telios, British-born Douglas Rizzo, and Susy Covaccini and Andrea Pedroni, both from Rome. An Italian public prosecutor has ordered an investigation into the accident, and the equipment used by the divers was checked for faults. Marco Sebastiani, one of the dive's five survivors, said by the time he realized the party was heading the wrong way, it was too late. ""All of a sudden the guide started to panic ... I knew something was wrong but at that point we had already entered the cave and we were going in even further. I tried to take control but it was too late,"" Sebastiani told Italy's Il Messaggero newspaper. Sebastiani, who owns a diving school in Rome, said: ""We suddenly found ourselves in a blind tunnel. We couldn't see anything. At that point it was panic. The agitation of the least experienced took hold. Mud and sand came up from the bottom of the cave and visibility was gone."" ""We couldn't find the exit. At a certain point I managed to find my way. I took as many people as I could with me and we swam towards the light, which grew bigger all the time. When I came up, I looked around to count us and I realised that Susy, Andrea, Douglas and Panos weren't there. I dove back in and went looking for them but I couldn't see them. Then my tank ran out of oxygen.""

"(CNN) -- The Australian government has angered koala conservationists by again delaying a decision on whether to add the national icon to the country's endangered species list. Last year, a Senate inquiry into the status, health and sustainability of Australia's koala population heard that there could be as few as 43,000 koalas left in the country. Millions have been killed since the arrival of European settlers in the 18th century. Numbers were slashed again during open hunting seasons in the early 20th century and in recent decades tens of thousands have died as a result of habitat destruction, disease -- including Chlamydia and retrovirus -- and dog attacks. On average, four koalas are admitted every week to Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, the country's largest wildlife hospital, after being hit by cars. The animals are also vulnerable to bushfires and drought. However, environment minister Tony Burke says he needs 10 more weeks to consider new information from the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (TSSC) on where the marsupial is under the greatest threat. It's the second time he's delayed the decision, which was initially due in October. ""I can't provide a blanket threatened species listing across Australia when there are many places where koala numbers remain high,"" he said in a statement. While the Senate report found there had been a ""marked decline"" in Australia's national koala population -- with the largest losses reported in the states of Queensland and New South Wales -- it said that in some areas of Victoria and South Australia koala colonies were ""flourishing."" Some say the disparity between survival rates in different parts of the country is complicating what should be a simple decision to grant koalas greater protection. ""In the Senate documents there wasn't one submission that said the koala as safe. Not one,"" said Deborah Tabart, chief executive of the Australian Koala Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to saving the species. Currently, koalas are listed as ""vulnerable"" under state legislation in Queensland and New South Wales, and as ""rare"" in South Australia. However, they are currently not granted any extra protection under federal law. Campaigners say a national listing is necessary because state governments have clearly failed to stop population declines. A national listing would offer greater protection to the koala under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999. Currently, more than 1,700 species and ecological communities face the threat of extinction, according to government figures. Tabart said the federal environment minister's decision to delay his verdict was a deliberate tactic to avoid it becoming an issue before the upcoming Queensland state election on March 24. Most koalas in the state are found in the south-east near the capital Brisbane, a growing city which is suffering a shortage of affordable housing. ""We are absolutely convinced it has nothing to do with koala biology. It has to do with politics and I'm ashamed of our minister,"" Tabart said. ""There's nothing that they could gather in 10 more weeks that hasn't been gathered by a 200-strong page Senate report that says the koala is in trouble."" ""The data that we have presented -- and 100 other submissions -- has taken us 25 years to gather and 26,000 man hours. So unless Minister Burke has a group of volunteers scouring the bush looking for koalas, this 10-week delay is nonsense,"" she said. Burke's office denied the delay was politically motivated and said that the minister was seeking more precise information on habitat boundaries. The minister says he doesn't expect the decision to be delayed beyond April 30. The question of whether koalas should be considered endangered has been considered three times in the last 15 years by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (TSSC). Each time, the committee found there was not enough data on koala populations to conclude that populations had fallen far enough to reach the threshold needed to declare them endangered under federal law. Internationally, the koala is listed as of ""least concern"" on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List. However, the U.S. considers the marsupial a threatened species.","Campaigners are urging koalas to be considered endangered .
As few as 43,000 of the national icons are left in Australia .

"(CNN) -- Not since the days of American track star Florence Griffith Joyner has nail art been front and center as an Olympic style trend like it is at the 2012 London Olympics. Athletes are showing their competitive spirit through flag-decorated nails and colors meant to mimic the medals they aim to win. But these special motifs aren't just for Olympians. Samantha Tremlin is one of many nail art fans getting into the spirit of the 2012 London Olympics with funky fingertips. She wasn't crazy about the Olympics before the summer games came to her country this year. But since then, the manicure fanatic who goes by ""the Nailasaurus"" has been honing her technique of recreating tiny Union Jack designs. ""Nail art is a hobby of mine, so as the Olympics are quite a big event and being held in my home country this year, I thought I would show some support for Team Great Britain!"" said the 21-year-old Cardiff, Wales, resident, who shared her handiwork on CNN iReport. ""This year it's very close to home. It feels as though the games have united every single person in the country with all excitement and pride we're feeling."" Share your Olympic-themed nail art on CNN iReport . From swimmers Missy Franklin and Rebecca Addlington to archers, cyclists and weightlifters, athletes everywhere are sporting patriotic nail decor at the games, thanks in part to British ""nail queen"" Sophy Robson, whose team of nail artists is providing services to athletes and their guests in ""grooming salons"" in the Olympic Village. ""It was such fun working with the athletes,"" said Robson, who designed a menu of 207 country flags to choose from in a partnership with corporate sponsor P&G. ""There are no egos involved and they are just excited to have something represent their country on their nails."" YouTube: Sophy Robson's Union Jack tutorial . Even if you're not in London or Europe, participating in the nail art trend connects viewers to the revelry, celebrity nail technician Deborah Lippmann said. ""It's a way that everyone can feel like they're a part of the experience in a supportive way, no matter where you are,"" said Lippman, whose eponymous nail polish brand is sold worldwide. It's not as permanent as a haircut and having 10 fingers means the opportunity to sport various themes, with one finger dedicated to the American flag in support of country and the other to Usain Bolt because he's just that cool. Related: Nail art is the new lipstick . The appeal for fans is probably the same as it is for athletes: you can show off your patriotism without saying a word, said Lisa Bailey, the blogger behind the DIY resource Nail Art 101. ""Nail art can have the stigma of being for ""prissy"" girls or girls who are afraid to get down and dirty,"" Bailey said. ""These women are showing that you can have hot nails and still break world records! It's no longer just for princesses and rich girls."" Da-Hae West, 25, is from South Korea, but she lives in London. She wrote ""Republic of Korea"" in Korean on her nails, accompanied by the national flag. ""It's a small way to show my support!"" she said in an iReport. Allison Fitzpatrick of Charlotte, North Carolina, has been experimenting with nail art for about two years as a way to ""spice up the average manicure,"" the 29-year-old said in an iReport. It's also a great way to feel connected to the games, especially since athletes are also wearing nail art, she said. ""With the Olympics being such an inspiring event I wanted to be able to add some of that inspiration to my everyday life,"" she said. ""Whether the design is the iconic Olympic rings, the Union Jack to celebrate the host city or a recreation of gold medalist Missy Franklin's patriotic nails, nail art is a fun and creative way to show support for the athletes right here at home."" With the home-court advantage, the Brits probably claim the most enthusiastic Olympic-themed nail art. Plus, there's a lot of room to play around with the Union Jack, as nail art enthusiast Jenny Pasha of London demonstrated with her gold studded set of nails. ""I wanted to create a set of nails that were unique and showed off my support for Team GB,"" said Pasha, who documents nail art inspiration on her blog. ""I have done Union flag nails many times in the past, but for the Olympics everyone's goal is to go for a gold medal, so I decided to do an all gold set of nails,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- At 32 years old Doug Ulman is president of cancer-support charity the Lance Armstrong Foundation. He has also survived three separate cases of cancer. In August 1996, Ulman was a 19-year-old college soccer player when a CAT scan revealed a shadow behind his heart. Doctors said there was only a slim chance he had cancer, but he needed surgery. During the operation, Ulman had an allergic reaction to the morphine he was being given as a painkiller, meaning he had to finish the surgery without any pain relief. He made it through the surgery, but two weeks later Ulman was told he had chondrosarcoma -- a bone cancer that develops in cartilage. ""Doctors started talking about 'we need to go in and take out part of your spine, and you may never walk again' -- things that were so drastic I couldn't even comprehend,"" Ulman told CNN. ""I went into a state of anger -- I just didn't know what to make of all of it. To have everything taken from you from a control perspective, to be a the mercy of others and to have to learn something you don't know anything about was really scary."" Supported by his parents, both of whom are themselves cancer survivors, Ulman recovered fully from the chondrosarcoma, but a few months later a mole on his chest was diagnosed as melanoma. Incredibly, three months later, Ulman was told he had a second melanoma. ""When you're 19, to have it [cancer] once is abnormal, but to go through this period between my 19th and 20th birthdays -- it's just not normal,"" he said .

His physical recovery has been so complete that he has managed to run numerous marathons, including a 100-mile run in the Himalayas, but he is careful to schedule his training runs early in the morning to protect himself from the sun. Realizing there was a lack of support for young adults with cancer, Ulman and his family founded the Ulman Cancer fund for Young Adults, which provides education, support and resources to young adults with cancer and their families. The foundation caught the notice of seven-times Tour de France champion and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong and he enlisted Ulman to help run the Lance Armstrong Foundation. CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta is also a board member of the foundation. Ulman says he now spends much of his time raising money and talking with cancer survivors and their families. ""It's incredibly beneficial to help other people,"" Ulman told CNN. ""You help yourself and it also allows us to focus on other people's experiences and try to help them as appose to dwelling on our own.

"(CNN)  -- Last year, the bus in which a young Congolese woman we met named Mary was riding was stopped by a militia. ""They wanted to all have me, to rape me,"" she related haltingly to us. ""I told them no, and then they took off my shirt and beat me. I have terrible marks now."" Mary's story is similar to hundreds of thousands of women's experiences in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where rape is routinely ""deployed"" as a weapon of war by the armed groups fighting over a nation that has some of the richest nonpetroleum natural resource deposits in the world. Congo holds the numbing distinction of being home to the deadliest war in the world since World War II -- with more than 5.4 million people killed during the past 15 years. ""This war is caused by the minerals,"" Mary told us. ""Those [armed groups] control the minerals. I hear that they are used in mobile phones. ... If you talk to Obama or the phone companies, tell them what happens here."" Armed groups in eastern Congo that control minerals, mines and trading routes generate an estimated $180 million each year by trading four main minerals: tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold. This money enables the armed groups to purchase large numbers of weapons and continue their campaign of brutal violence against civilians. Conflict minerals are key components in the manufacture of cell phones, laptops, digital cameras, video games and portable music players. Because of increasing awareness of the links between electronics products and the worst sexual violence in the world, change is afoot. During U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to eastern Congo in August, she said: ""With respect to companies that are responsible for what are now being called conflict minerals, I think the international community must start looking at steps we can take to try to prevent the mineral wealth from the DRC ending up in the hands of those who fund the violence here."" The U.S. Congress has also initiated a strong bipartisan effort to curb the conflict minerals trade. Senate and House bills on this issue represent a significant step toward having conflict-free cell phones and laptops by setting up a system of audits and minerals-tracing mechanisms. This would reveal which phones and laptops contain conflict minerals and which ones do not. Introduced by Sens. Sam Brownback (R-Kansas), Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin) and Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) on the Senate side, and Reps. Jim McDermott (D-Washington), Frank Wolf (R-Virginia), Barney Frank (D-Massachusetts) and Donald Payne (D-New Jersey) on the House side, the bills already have the support of powerful committee chairmen but still must be moved through committee. With the Obama administration and Congress taking a strong interest in this issue, and activist campaigning building some momentum, companies have begun to react. The tin industry has gone the furthest by introducing an initiative to increase due diligence and trace minerals on the ground in Congo. Electronics companies also have a project under way to map out supply chains. And Intel, HP, Dell, and Motorola are hosting a meeting with activists on conflict minerals in San Francisco, California, this month. But it is not enough. Campus activists -- from New York; to Knoxville, Tennessee; to Nevada -- are taking up this issue with increased vigor, along with major faith-based groups, from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to Jewish World Watch. Are the government and company actions taken to date enough to stop the conflict minerals trade from continuing? The answer is no. Electronics companies must invest in a system to certify that the minerals used in their products are verifiably conflict-free. They must work with their suppliers to trace the minerals back to their mines of origin and have independent audits conducted of these supply chains so that we know with verified proof that none has passed through the hands of armed groups. The Obama administration should help companies develop a certification process for conflict minerals, built on the lessons of the Kimberley Process for blood diamonds. The administration can also help devise a public-private partnership to work with companies, the Congolese government and other key donor countries to help miners in eastern Congo and improve mining inspection and tracing on the ground. Companies and the government can take steps today. For a start, electronics companies should have audits conducted of their supply chains for the minerals. And Congress should pass the conflict minerals legislation, to get tracing started. If you have a cell phone, you can also have an impact. Ask your senator and representative to sign the Congo Conflict Minerals Act (S. 891) and Conflict Minerals Trade Act (H.R. 4128), and find a creative way to reach your cell phone manufacturer to tell it you want a conflict-free cell phone. The minerals supply chain involves multiple companies, and the war in Congo will not be resolved overnight. But if companies and consumers take a stand and say ""Give us conflict-free products,"" we can stop this deadly trade and put real pressure on the armed groups that rape women on a mass scale in eastern Congo. Let Mary's request not be forgotten. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sasha Lezhnev and John Prendergast.","Lezhnev, Prendergast: Congo ""conflict minerals"" fund deadly war in which rape is routine .

"(CNN) -- Bionic engineering -- long the subject of science fiction novels and Hollywood blockbusters -- is now helping paraplegics make walking a reality. The so-called Ekso, a mechanical skeleton created by California-based company Ekso Bionics, is designed to give paraplegics the power to walk unaided. The innovation mean the power of bionics, which inspired the hit movie Iron Man and the television series The Six Million Dollar Man, is becoming reality. Suzanne Edwards, who suffered a spinal chord injury that left her wheelchair-bound, has used the Ekso and told CNN it was an ""amazing feeling."" Edwards said, ""to be told you are never going to walk again, and then to be up and walking so quickly and easily in this -- and it feels so natural and normal -- you know you can't really fault it."" Ekso Bionics chief executive Eythor Bender and his team developed the robotic model to help wheelchair users and those who have suffered spinal chord injuries. The mechanical skeleton is a ready-to-wear, battery-powered outfit that is strapped over the user's clothing and responds to a control panel. The company also offers assistance for the more able-bodied. ""We are working with soldiers -- the most able-bodied -- to carry more weight and reduce back injuries,"" Bender said. ""Then there is everyone in between that [who] need power,"" he added. ""Construction workers need to hold tools to become more productive, and you and me might want to climb Kilimanjaro and need extra power from a bionic leg,"" he said. The developments of Ekso Bionics are funded through private investments and government grants. The company is also targeting the medical industry. It has sold 16 devices to rehabilitation centers and hospitals in the U.S. The company expects that to rise to 45 by the end of 2012. In Europe, they expect to deliver up to 20 suits this year. The exo-skeleton costs $130,000 -- but Bender believes this is a small price to pay. ""It's a high cost but considering you are helping people walk again, I think it is pretty cheap,"" he said. CNN's Oliver Joy contributed to this report .","Ekso Bionics has designed a bionic suit to give paraplegics the power to walk unaided.

"(CNN) -- Oh, New York. People say you never sleep, and you're filled with neon lights and people scurrying from place to place. Rumor has it you're a tough place to call home. Some suggest that people leave before you get a chance to harden them. But lately, we're a little taken aback by all the good things we keep hearing about you. You're not getting soft, are you? The sweet city stories are getting hard to ignore. Here are three recent examples that caught our attention: . Not another manic Monday . When we first heard about your murder-free Monday, we were tempted to shrug it off as some random thing. (There was not a single reported slaying, stabbing, shooting or knifing in any of the five boroughs on Monday, according to the New York Police Department.) Some of our commenters were thrilled or surprised. ""Having lived in 'the world's greatest city' for over 30 years, I never thought I'd see the day,"" wrote reader BlackDynamiteOnline. A few attributed the numbers to online shoppers hunkered down for Cyber Monday or criminals who did a better job of hiding bodies than usual. Others thought the whole thing was a little strange. ""Imagine! We are celebrating a murder-free day,"" said KPerspective. ""This is sordidly interesting."" There was more good news to come. Random acts of kindness . The police officer who gave a pair of boots to a homeless man is the talk of the Web. Jennifer Foster, a tourist from Florence, Arizona, snapped a photo near Times Square that ended up being posted on the NYPD Facebook page. The post received 338,000 likes and more than 22,000 comments. ""This is awesome. We shouldn't be surprised by this,"" commented Facebook user Tony Stiltner. ""I believe things like this should be the norm. But I am absolutely thrilled. The officer is a true hero and others should learn from his actions."" Twitter users picked it up as well, and the #NYPD hashtag was full of tweets buzzing about the story on Thursday morning. ""(Shout out) to the #NYPD cop that bought the homeless barefoot man some socks and winter boots,"" wrote J Tucker in a tweet. ""That's awesome. Wish more cops were like him."" We also heard good things about storm recovery efforts. Generosity after disaster . Let us not forget how people have come together as the East Coast recovers from the pounding it received from Superstorm Sandy. We received numerous iReports sharing stories of giving and courage, and highlighted a few of them in a story on CNN.com. An impromptu Broadway performance, volunteer work, storytelling, photo restoration efforts and a rapping duo were among the efforts we heard about. Upon encountering this story, a reader using the name Reen B raved about the people of the region. ""I love New Yorkers. Good for these people for helping out with their creativity, a gift not all of us have but everyone can appreciate. Godspeed, NY/NJ, here's to healing and hope."" What gives? Maybe the holidays have everyone in an extra-good mood. That's assuming we make it past our upcoming date with Doomsday, which no doubt has some people musing about the fragility of life. We're still a little baffled -- and delighted! -- by all these touching stories, so we now turn back to you. Is there something really going on here?

"(EW.com) -- In the years since its 1981 release, Sam Raimi's cabin-in-the-woods cheapie ""The Evil Dead"" has been elevated to the realm of myth. You won't find many films as near and dear to the hearts of horror nerds. The legacy isn't based on the fact that ""The Evil Dead"" had a great screenplay, because it didn't. In fact, the plot is as basic as they come: Five college students drive out to a shack in the middle of nowhere, mess with an old reel-to-reel tape recorder that plays malevolent incantations, and unleash bloody Lovecraftian hell. The film's effects were cut-rate even for the early '80s, and the acting (other than a charismatic breakout turn by lantern-jawed B-movie icon Bruce Campbell) was amateurish at best. What made it a fright flick for the ages was its 22-year-old wunderkind director's dime-store ingenuity and gonzo wit. Raimi jerry-rigged cameras onto two-by-fours and whipped them around like Orson Welles on speed. His off-kilter angles gave the movie a weird, anxious energy. It was an eye-popping debut...and a hard act for anyone to follow. A certain subset of genre purists and Fangoria subscribers already have their knives out for the remake. But they can put them away. The new ""Evil Dead"" is not only made with an affectionate nod and a wink to the 1981 version, it's also the bloodiest, goriest, slapstickiest horror movie since, well, ""The Evil Dead."" 'American Idol' exit: 'I want to do so much' Directed with gutsy promise by newcomer Fede Alvarez (and produced, and thus blessed, by Raimi and Campbell themselves), the update doesn't mess with the original's bare-bones formula too much. It barrels right into the familiar story, placing five old pals in a run-down cabin, having them discover an old book filled with demonic illustrations and harrowing warnings, and once again releasing the gruesome genie from the bottle. Other than ""Suburgatory's"" Jane Levy, the cast isn't weighed down by too many familiar faces, which seems right since these are pretty much interchangeable folks lining up for the body count. And what a juicy, splattery body count it is. In ""Evil Dead"", blood sprays in arterial geysers like the fountains outside the Bellagio in Vegas. One possessed character licks a box cutter, butterflying her tongue in half. Another has rats pouring out of her mouth like clowns piling out of a VW Bug. Eyes are stabbed with hypodermic needles, limbs are severed with electric carving knives, and chain saws do what chain saws do. Did I mention it's a comedy? 'American Idol': Singer exiting tonight is... Some will have a hard time seeing it that way, I know. The audience I saw it with screamed, gasped, and buried their faces in their dates' necks. But horror films and TV shows such as The Walking Dead are like a foreign language. Either they speak to you or they don't. The new ""Evil Dead's"" delirious gross-out scenes spoke to me, and they go further than any mainstream picture I can think of. How a movie this graphic and gooey managed to finagle an R rating is a mystery. But I'm not complaining.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A top Taliban leader in Pakistan is buying and selling children for suicide bombings, Pakistani and U.S. officials said. Children are shown at a training camp in this video footage shot by the Taliban. Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud has been increasingly using the children in attacks, the officials said. A video released by Pakistan's military shows the children training for the task. In the video of a training camp, children can be seen going through exercises. Mehsud has been selling the children, once trained, to other Taliban officials for $6,000 to $12,000, Pakistani military officials said.  Watch more about the child bombers » . Some of the children are as young as 11, the officials said. ""He has been admitting he holds a training center for young boys, for preparing them for suicide bombing. So he is on record saying all this, accepting these crimes,"" said Major General Akhtar Abbas, spokesman for the Pakistani army. The young suicide bombers may be able to reach targets unnoticed, the military said. ""If he is approaching on foot, there is a possibility he will bypass security,"" Abbas said. ""In certain areas, there is a possibility in the population centers everyone can not be checked physically, so he can create havoc there."" Pakistan has launched an offensive against the Taliban, started in the Swat region of the North West Frontier Province. The Taliban have countered with a spate of suicide bombings, including a July 2 attack in Rawalpindi, in which a suicide bomber on a motorcycle struck a Pakistani Defense Ministry bus. At least one person was killed and 29 others were wounded. Pakistan's army said it is hunting Mehsud in the hopes that the supply of suicide bombers will dry up after the Taliban leader is captured. Meanwhile, a suspected U.S. drone attack killed at least 12 people and wounded five others in northwest Pakistan Tuesday, Pakistani officials said. The missile strikes in South Waziristan targeted a suspected Taliban hideout at a madrassa, or Muslim school, in Zangarah, according to intelligence officials. The attack near the border with Afghanistan involved a pair of missiles shot from an unmanned drone, local resident Janbaz Mehsud told CNN. He said all the dead and wounded were Taliban. A local government official, who asked not to be named, said the madrassa was a training center for the Taliban and belongs to Baitullah Mehsud. That official put the death toll at 14, but said the number of dead could rise. The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported drone attacks. However, the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones, which are controlled remotely.","Official: Baitullah Mehsud increasingly using the children in attacks .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabian officials beheaded and then publicly displayed the body of a convicted killer in Riyadh on Friday, an act that prompted a stiff denunciation by a leading human rights monitor. The Saudi Interior Ministry said Ahmed Al-Shamlani Al-Anzi was sentenced to death and then ""crucifixion"" -- having his body displayed in public -- for the kidnapping and killing of an 11-year-old boy and for the killing of the boy's father, according to the official Saudi Press Agency. Amnesty International issued a statement deploring the punishment, with the group's Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui saying in a statement it is ""horrific"" that beheadings and crucifixions ""still happen."" Even though the word ""crucifixion"" is used to describe the public display, the act has no connection to Christianity and the crucifixion of Jesus. The bodies are not displayed on crosses, Lamri Chirouf, who researches Saudi Arabian issues for Amnesty, explained. The Saudi Interior Ministry asserted that Al-Anzi's body was displayed as a warning that those involved in similar crimes would suffer the same fate, the press agency reported. The ministry said Al-Anzi kidnapped the boy and held him for a ""malicious purpose"" at a grocery store where he worked. He tied rope around the boy's neck and strangled him to death, the ministry said. When the boy's father came to the store looking for his son, Al-Anzi axed the father repeatedly until the man died. When police came to arrest Al-Anzi, Al-Anzi resisted arrest by threatening them with a knife. Police later discovered that Al-Anzi had been previously convicted of other crimes, including possession of pornographic videos and sodomy, the Interior Ministry said. Chirouf, the Saudi Arabian researcher for Amnesty International, said his understanding of how the Saudi government carries out crucifixion jibed with Saudi Press Agency's account. Government officials do use crucifixions, or public displays of executed bodies, as a tool to deter people from committing such a crime, he said. This latest case was classified as an offense of rebellion, one that basically rejected all of the rules of religion and society, he said. Chirouf said those crucified are beheaded first and then their heads are sewn back on their bodies. Then, the corpse is mounted on a pole or a tree. The English-language Saudi Gazette newspaper said the body was placed on public display throughout the evening and Chirouf said it was his understanding that the body was to be displayed for a few hours. In its denunciation of the punishment, Amnesty International deplored the ""extensive use of the death penalty"" in Saudi Arabia. ""King Abdullah should show true leadership and commute all death sentences if Saudi Arabia is to have any role to play as a global leader or member of the G-20,"" Sahraoui said. The group asserts that ""trial proceedings"" in the country ""fall far below international fair-trial standards."" ""They usually take place behind closed doors without adequate legal representation. Convictions are often made on the basis of ""confessions"" obtained under duress, including torture or other ill-treatment during incommunicado detention,"" Amnesty International said. ""Those who are sentenced to death are often not informed of the progress of legal proceedings against them or of the date of execution until the morning when they are taken out and beheaded."" Amnesty International said there were 102 executions in Saudi Arabia in 2008 and is aware of 136 people believed to be awaiting execution. It says there has been ""a high number of executions of migrant workers and other foreign nationals, in particular from Asia and Africa."" Al-Anzi was a Saudi national, said Chirouf -- who added ""nobody knows how many people are on death row"" in Saudi Arabia.","Man executed for kidnapping, killing boy and killing of the boy's father .

"(CNN) -- Martin McGowan insisted on going to high school baseball tryouts, despite his mother's worries he wasn't feeling well. After the tryouts, the 15-year-old complained of leg pain and seemed exhausted. He woke up and vomited during the night, Diane McGowan recalled. She gave him medicine for his fever, and he returned to bed, only to wake again, vomiting and complaining of leg pain. At the emergency room, doctors diagnosed Martin with the flu, and said his leg pain was due to ""compartment syndrome,"" Diane McGowan said. ""Because the muscle has no room between the skin and the bone, it causes pressure on the arteries and veins with your bone, and can eventually cut off the circulation,"" she said. ""So if they had not taken him into surgery ... they might have had to amputate his legs."" But no one was prepared for what happened next -- Martin died on the operating table that day in 2005. ""What I later found out is that the flu attacks the muscles, and that's why you feel achy when you get the flu,"" his mother said. ""Because he was so healthy, and because of the exertion he had done the night before, it (the influenza) went thru his system quicker than it would go through a normal child. ... The heart is a muscle, and his heart gave out on the table."" While Martin's complication was uncommon, influenza can produce complications that result in death, including pneumonia, bacterial infection, acute respiratory failure, and encephalitis, even in otherwise healthy children. His death has been motivation for his mother to work toward preventing such deaths in other children. Getting children ready for flu season . At the time, Diane McGowan noted, it wasn't recommended that children Martin's age get the flu vaccine -- something she worked to change, lobbying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to increase flu immunization requirements for children and teens. She is now a volunteer with Families Fighting Flu, a group run exclusively by families who have experienced the loss of a child or a child who has suffered serious complications from the flu. The group receives funding through private donations as well as funding from organizations that include pharmaceutical companies in the form of unrestricted grants. New research presented last week shows that healthy children, as well as those with underlying health conditions, are at risk of dying from flu-associated causes. The research was presented at IDWeek 2012, the first conference held by a consortium of infectious disease groups. It examined deaths among children over the past eight flu seasons. Between 2004 and 2012, 829 U.S. children under 18 died from influenza-associated causes. While many of the deaths occurred among children with underlying health conditions, including neurological disorders, asthma or lung disease, and genetic or chromosomal disorders, 40% occurred among children with no known medical condition, according to lead author Dr. Karen K. Wong of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Healthy children actually died more quickly, according to the research, with a median of four days from symptoms to death. That's compared to a median of seven days from symptoms to death among children with a pre-existing condition. ""Because influenza-associated deaths can occur rapidly in children, prevention is really the best defense,"" explained Wong, noting that over a third of deaths occurred in children younger than age 5 -- a group known to be at high risk -- and 11% occurred in children younger than 6 months. That's a group that is too young to be vaccinated. New research raises hopes in quest to find universal flu vaccine . School-based influenza vaccination programs, however, may help prevent the spread of the virus among children and young adults. In tandem with the new data on pediatric flu deaths, an example of promising new research on flu prevention was presented at the ID Week 2012 meeting. Results of a school-based program were presented by Dr. Pia Pannaraj, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Southern California and Children's Hospital Los Angeles. ""We looked at a proactive approach for how to prevent influenza,"" Pannaraj said. Her study followed 4,500 elementary school children in eight schools in Los Angeles County during the 2010-11 flu season. Half had a school-based flu vaccination program. The schools without a program served as the control group. Thirty to 50% of children in the vaccine program schools received a flu vaccine. If any child came down with respiratory symptoms or a fever, cough or runny nose, they were tested for influenza. The process was done for all schools, Pannaraj explained, and included contacting homes of children who were out sick to make sure they were appropriately tested. ""We found that children who were vaccinated were three times less likely to get the flu and missed half the number of school days compared to children who were not vaccinated,"" said Pannaraj. ""In our schools that had school-based influenza vaccination programs, their rates of influenza overall at the entire school were lower than at school that did not have any vaccination program. And again, also their attendance rates were also much higher than the schools that did not have any vaccination program."" Vitamin D supplements no help for colds, flu . Vaccination of school-age children is important, Pannaraj said, because ""children are very capable of spreading the flu. They go to school, they're in their classrooms, they're all together -- they touch each other, touch doors, pass around papers and pencils."" They also can go home and spread the flu virus to family members including the very young or the elderly, who can become severely ill. The entire community also benefits from school-based immunization programs, she said, as it means less time away from work for parents caring for sick children. In addition, parents don't have to take their children elsewhere for the vaccine if they receive it at school. Another bonus: ""In the school where the vaccination rate was close to 50%, we see some protection extended even to those kids who were unvaccinated,"" she said. ""Their rates of influenza were less compared to schools with lower vaccination rates."" There are simple steps that families can take to fight the flu. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older. Vaccination is critical for people who live with or care for young children or children with medical conditions, to prevent the spread of flu to high-risk children. Moms can help protect their babies by getting a flu shot during pregnancy. And make sure that family members and caregivers -- including babysitters and grandparents -- are all vaccinated to prevent spreading flu to children too young for vaccination. While vaccination is the first line of defense, if children do get the flu, prescription antiviral medicines, which include Tamiflu (generic name oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir), are recommended by the CDC as treatment to help ease symptoms and shorten the duration of the illness, Wong said.","Martin McGowan, 15, was healthy, yet died from influenza complications .
New research shows that healthy children are also at risk of such complications .
School-based flu vaccination programs may provide an important prevention tool ."

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Gunmen attacked a church in the central Nigerian state of Kogi, killing at least 19 people, a military official said Tuesday. Among the dead was the pastor of the Deeper Life church in Okene, Lt. Col. Gabriel Olorunyomi said. No one has claimed responsibility, but immediate suspicion fell on the militant Islamic group Boko Haram, which has carried out similar church attacks in the past. An eyewitness told CNN that the attackers were carrying sophisticated firearms and shot randomly at the members of the congregation gathered for Bible study Monday night. Blood flowed through the church as bodies fell limp, the witness said. Religious attacks have been on the rise in Nigeria recently. Christian and Muslim militant groups have attacked each other's religious sites, claiming retaliation for prior attacks. At least three people were killed and 14 were wounded in an explosion at a mosque in Maiduguri last month. And on June 17, at least 50 people were killed at three churches. Boko Haram claimed responsibility. ""Let them know that now it's the time for revenge God willing,"" the group said then.

"Toulepleu, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Clashes along Ivory Coast's border with Liberia led thousands of people to flee their villages Tuesday, officials said. The confrontations occurred four days after seven U.N. peacekeepers and four civilians were killed in an ambush in the same area. An armed group initiated an assault before dawn Tuesday on the village of Sioblo-Oula near the larger town of Tai, killing at least four civilians, wounding three and kidnapping two, said Tai's youth president, Toubate Darius. The national army, FRCI, sought to protect them. Tai Mayor Tere Tehe said one FRCI soldier was killed in the clashes, which lasted for 12 hours before ending Tuesday afternoon. Tehe said hundreds of displaced people had arrived in Tai, where some of them sought shelter in the city hall. Others had fled to the forest, he said. The Liberian border has been officially closed since June 10, but ""the border in this region is porous,"" said FRCI Commander Aboubakar Sangare, in Toulepleu. The movement began after blue-helmeted peacekeepers, who were in the area as reinforcements because of threats against civilians, came under attack last week. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Friday called on the government of Ivory Coast ""to do its utmost to identify the perpetrators and hold them accountable."" He added that he understood other peacekeepers remained in danger. A spokeswoman for the U.N. mission in Ivory Coast said Friday's incident was the first attack on peacekeepers since they entered the country in 2004. Sylvie van den Wildenberg, in a telephone interview from her office in Abidjan, said the remaining forces were continuing to protect area residents, ""who are living in a very difficult terrain -- their villages scattered."" Van den Wildenberg said it was not clear who was responsible for the attack. ""This is an area where you have so many different types of armed people,"" she said. ""People have different aims and different reasons to carry arms and to perpetrate attack. So this is a very complex environment. We can't extrapolate. We just can't fingerpoint any group."" The peacekeepers were on a reconnaissance patrol because U.N. officials had heard rumors several days earlier of armed men in the area threatening to attack a village, she said. U.N. peacekeepers remained in Ivory Coast after the 2010 presidential election, when the country was thrown into crisis after incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo refused to acknowledge defeat to former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara. The latter was sworn in on May 21. Western Ivory Coast has been largely supportive of Gbagbo. During the post-election crisis, his supporters massed heavy weapons here. According to the United Nations, its peacekeeping force in Ivory Coast as of April 30 included nearly 11,000 uniformed personnel, as well as several hundred international civilian personnel, local staff and volunteers. They provide technical, logistical and security support to the government. Authorities in the area have blamed the violence on militia supporters of Gbagbo based in Liberia but officials with the U.N. peackeeping mission in Ivory Coast have said they do not know whom to blame. Gbagbo has been in custody at the Hague, accused of crimes against humanity during the post-election violence, in which thousands of people were killed. Also Tuesday, the International Criminal Court at the Hague postponed a hearing for Gbagbo that had been scheduled for June 18. No new date was set.","The fighting comes four days after 7 U.N. peacekeepers were killed in the area .

"(CNN) -- The wearing o' the green has Australian eyes smiling. Adam Scott won the 77th Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Georgia -- and the green jacket that goes to the champion -- on Sunday, beating Argentine Angel Cabrera on the second hole of a thrilling, sudden-death playoff to become the first Australian ever to win the Masters. ""Australia's a proud sporting nation, and this was one notch in the belt that we'd never got, and amazing that it's come down to me today,"" Scott, 32, told CBS' Jim Nantz on the post-tourney telecast. For years, Scott, who has been ranked in the top 20 of the official world golf rankings for the better part of a decade, was considered one of the best golfers to have never won one of golf's four major championships: the Masters, the U.S. Open, the British Open, and the PGA championship. Australians had come in second in the Masters seven times before, most recently when Scott and Jason Day, who finished third this year, tied as runner-ups in 2011. The most famous Australian golfer of all time, Greg Norman, finished second at Augusta National Golf Club three times, in 1986, 1987, and 1996. Scott praised Norman after Sunday's victory. ""There was one guy who inspired a nation of golfers, and that's Greg Norman,"" Scott said. ""You know, he's been incredible to me, and all the young golfers in Australia, and part of this definitely belongs to him."" In 1996, Norman turned a six-stroke Masters lead into a five-stroke loss with a final round 78. SI.com called the collapse one of the most painful moments in sports history. Scott survived his own painful ordeal in last year's British Open, when he bogeyed the last four holes at Royal Lytham and St. Annes Golf Club to lose by a stroke to Ernie Els. On Sunday, Scott put his past shortcomings behind him. ""It seems a long way away from a couple of years ago here, and even last July, when I was trying to win another major. I found my way today. There was some luck there somewhere. I don't know how to digest it all at the moment, but it was incredible,"" he said. ""I'm just so proud of myself and everyone around me who's helped me. The list is so long."" One name on that list is easy to determine. For the past two years, Scott's team has included caddie Steve Williams, who carried the bag for 13 of Tiger Woods' 14 major tournament victories. This weekend, Williams helped guide his new boss to the Masters title, while his old boss, Woods, finished tied for fourth, four strokes off Scott's pace. Scott also had special support behind the scenes at Augusta National: his father. ""A hug with him behind the 10th green there when it was all over is something I'll never forget,"" Scott said, while also acknowledging his mother and sister back home. ""Just incredible to have him here.""","Adam Scott is the first Australian ever to win the Masters golf tournament .

"(CNN) -- The head of a U.N. nuclear watchdog group said Friday a deal with Iran over its nuclear program is likely in January, an agreement that will also allow inspectors to gain access to a military complex where Tehran is believed to be testing nuclear materials. The news followed reports that the International Atomic Energy Agency wrapped one-day talks in Iran over its nuclear program, widely suspected by the United States and other Western nations as a front for the country's development of nuclear weapons -- a charge Iran has repeatedly denied. ""We have agreed to meet again on 16 January next year, where we expect to finalize the structured approach and start implementing it then shortly after that,"" IAEA chief inspector Herman Nackaerts told reporters after returning to Vienna, Austria. Read more: CNN Fact Check: Iran and the Bomb . The talks between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) were aimed at jump-starting negotiations, while allowing agency inspectors to gain access to a military complex where Tehran is suspected of testing nuclear materials. Access to the Parchin military complex, just outside Tehran, is a key element in the negotiations. ""We have not been given access to Parchin this time. But as you know access to Parchin is part of the structured approach, and we hope as I said that we will implement that shortly,"" Nackaerts said. Read more: U.N. watchdog: Iran makes significant nuclear steps . Iran's liaison to IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, characterized the talks as constructive, according to state-run news agency IRNA. The report stopped short of saying whether the talks included discussion about investigators getting access to Parchin, which was requested at a meeting in November in Vienna, Austria. The next round of talks were scheduled for January 16, Soltanieh told IRNA. The IAEA also confirmed the talks would continue on that day. The United States, meanwhile, slapped new sanctions on Iran on Thursday, targeting a handful of companies and individuals it says are providing materials and technology to Tehran's nuclear program. The sanctions, announced by the U.S. State and Treasury departments, are the latest to target Iran's economy as well as its ability to develop nuclear material. Read more: U.N. nuclear agency expresses 'serious concern' about Iran nuke activity . The sanctions were essential ""given Iran's continued intransigence on its nuclear program,"" said Victoria Nuland, the U.S. State Department spokeswoman. Among the targets of the latest sanctions is Prof. Fereydoun Abbasi Davani, the head of the Iran Atomic Energy Organization. Abbasi Davani and his wife survived a car bomb two years ago that Tehran has blamed on Israel. At least four scientists associated with Iran's nuclear program have been killed since 2010. The companies being targeted with sanctions: FaraTech, the Neda Industrial Group, Aria Nikan Marine Industry, Towled Abzar Boreshi, Iran Pouya, Terjerat Gostar and Tarh O Palayesh. Read more: Inspection at Iran nuclear facility finds higher-level traces of uranium, U.N. says . The sanctions freeze the companies' assets and prohibit business dealings in or with the United States. Companies and banks that defy the U.S. sanctions could be cut off from the U.S. financial system, the State and Treasury departments said. Iran maintains its nuclear program is for civilian energy purposes only. But the IAEA has said it cannot verify whether the intent of the program is for peaceful means. A number of Western nations have placed economic and arms-related sanctions on Iran since November 2010 when the IAEA said Tehran was pursuing technology that could be used to build nuclear weapons. Since then, Iran has been hit by the United States and the European Union with an oil embargo as well as sanctions targeting its banks and number of its businesses. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne reported from London and Chelsea J. Carter from Atlanta.","NEW: IAEA and Iran close to an agreement, nuclear watchdog chief says .

"(CNN) -- Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan has told CNN that Indian cinema needs to move beyond traditional song-and-dance musicals amid increasing international competition in the Mumbai studios' domestic market. Bachchan, India's favorite film star and a regular presence in Bollywood productions for four decades, said that Indian audiences exposed to Western television and cinema expected Indian movies to be ""at least on a par with is happening in other parts of the world."" ""Technology means the common man has access to the very best in entertainment from other parts of the world almost instantly,"" the 67-year-old told Connect the World. He said Indian audiences were dictating that Bollywood move away from the studio's traditional musical love stories to deal with more serious themes. ""We do want to make different kinds of films and I think recent not-so-successful releases have indicated that audiences in India are now wanting to move away from the traditional format of escapist commercial cinema and see cinema with a greater amount of meaning,"" Bachchan said. Bachchan said his latest movie, ""Pa,"" in which he plays a teenager with an aging disorder which means he looks older than his own father -- played by Bachchan's son, Abhishek -- was an example of a new style of film with broader appeal which Bollywood was capable of making. Asked whether he would ever consider roles in Hollywood to show the world his versatile talent, Bachchan said: ""I don't think there is a great amount of versatility in my performances."" But he added: ""If there was an offer that was of interest then I would most certainly look at it.""","Amitabh Bachchan says Bollywood needs to move beyond traditional movies .

"Washington (CNN) -- Authorities have arrested two Georgetown University students and another person in connection with a suspected drug lab found inside a dormitory Saturday morning, the Metropolitan Police Department said. The three males, each at least 18, face charges of possession of drug paraphernalia, said Officer Hugh Carew, a spokesman for the police department. The third individual was a campus visitor. None was identified. Police said that shortly before 6 a.m., they received a call about a foul odor at Georgetown's Harbin Hall. Initially, police thought the lab was for producing meth but later said it was used to make Dimethyltryptamine, a hallucinogenic drug commonly known as DMT. DMT is classified as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning it has no accepted medical use for treatment of any kind in the United States. Federal trafficking of Schedule 1 drugs carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, said Rusty Payne, a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman. DMT is a hallucinogenic that can be produced synthetically, but it also comes from a variety of plants and seeds found in South America, Payne said. The substance can be sniffed, smoked or injected, giving the user a short high sometimes referred to as a ""business man's trip"" because it lasts about an hour. In addition to the charges of drug paraphernalia possession, the men arrested could also potentially face federal drug trafficking charges if anything more serious is uncovered by the DEA's investigation, Payne said. Harbin Hall was evacuated most of the day following the discovery of the suspected lab. Medical personnel evaluated seven people, including two security officers, at the scene, said fire department spokesman Pete Piringer . No injuries were reported, and the DEA determined that the chemicals used in the suspected lab posed no health risk to students in the dorm. ""The DEA has informed us that there was never a health risk to students in Harbin, including those on the same floor, beyond those who lived in the room,"" Todd Olson, vice president of student affairs, said in a statement to Georgetown students and faculty. ""Hazardous materials experts have now removed all potential contaminants."" Olson said: ""The use, production and distribution of illegal drugs are issues we take very seriously and are violations of the student code of conduct. MPD [Metropolitan Police Department] has arrested three individuals, two of whom are Georgetown undergraduates. They remain in police custody."" Both the DEA and university ask that anyone with information in connection with the incident contact the DEA Washington office, or Georgetown's Department of Public Safety at 202-687-4343.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Following a day of talks, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Chinese leaders said their two nations would work together to press North Korea to tone down its provocations, amid soaring regional tensions. Speaking to reporters in Beijing, Kerry said both the United States and China are calling on North Korea to refrain from any provocative steps -- including any missile launches. But, he said, both nations want to focus on a peaceful solution, not ""threat for threat or confrontational language. There's been enough of that."" No option was left off the table in his talks with Chinese leaders, he said. Among those he met with Saturday were Chinese President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and State Councilor Yang. Kerry said there was no question that China was very serious about upholding international standards. As he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Kerry said, ""Mr. president, this is obviously a critical time with some very challenging issues -- issues on the Korean peninsula, the challenge of Iran and nuclear weapons, Syria and the Middle East, and economies around the world that are in need of a boost."" Kerry in Japan amid heightened Korean tensions . In a joint statement before dinner, Kerry and Yang reaffirmed their intention to work together toward the peaceful denuclearization of North Korea. ""We agreed that this is critically important for the stability of the region and indeed for the world and for all our nonproliferation efforts,"" said Kerry. ""We are committed to taking actions in order to make good on that goal and we are committed to make that goal a reality."" China's position is ""consistent and clear cut,"" Yang said. ""China is firmly committed to upholding peace and stability and advancing the denuclearization process on the peninsula."" Beijing will work with its international partners to help restart the stalled six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program and hold it accountable to its international agreements, he said. Opinion: Why I fled North Korea . 'Mutual respect' Meeting earlier with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Kerry said there were ""enormously challenging issues"" in front of the two nations. ""I look forward to having that conversation with you today ... (to) define for both of us what the model relationship should be and how two great powers, China and the United States, can work effectively to solve problems,"" he said. Wang said he hoped the two nations could work together to handle sensitive issues with ""mutual respect."" Kerry landed in Beijing after leaving Seoul, South Korea, where he pledged unbending U.S. military support against any attack from the North. Washington wants Beijing to ""stop the money trail into North Korea"" and give Pyongyang a strong message that China wants the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons, two U.S. administration officials said. U.S. officials said China has recently expressed frustrations over Pyongyang's actions. ""We hear a growing tone of frustration ... in official statements from the Chinese,"" an administration official said. ""China is increasingly concerned about the downstream effects of North Korea's reckless pursuit of a nuclear missile capability and complications for China's foreign strategic environment."" Kerry will seek to define the areas of common interest with China. ""We have a common interest in putting an end to North Korean proliferation,"" a senior administration official said. ""In stopping the highly destabilizing behavior and the provocative actions of the North Koreans."" Kerry is also expected to address computer hacking coming from state-sponsored sources inside China. Should the U.S. shoot down a missile? Support for Seoul . During his visit to Seoul on Friday, Kerry said the United States would talk to North Korea, but only if the country gets serious about negotiating the end of its nuclear weapons program. ""North Korea will not be accepted as a nuclear power,"" Kerry said in Seoul. His trip to South Korea came a day after a Pentagon intelligence assessment surfaced suggesting North Korea may have developed the ability to fire a nuclear-tipped missile at its foes. Disclosed first by a congressman at a hearing Thursday, and then confirmed to CNN by the Defense Department, the Defense Intelligence Agency assessment is the clearest acknowledgment yet by the United States about potential advances in North Korea's nuclear program. U.S. officials think North Korea could test-launch a mobile ballistic missile at any time in what would be seen by the international community as a highly provocative move. But a senior administration official said there's no indication that any such missiles are armed with nuclear material. Pentagon spokesman George Little said that ""it would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced"" in the DIA study. The DIA has been wrong in the past, producing an assessment in 2002 that formed the basis for arguments that Iraq had nuclear weapons -- a view later found to be incorrect. Nevertheless, Kerry said any launch by North Korea would be a ""huge mistake."" North Korea's propaganda machine grips defector 11 years on . Bellicose North . Despite weeks of bellicose rhetoric from Pyongyang threatening nuclear attacks on the United States, South Korea and their allies, U.S. officials have characterized the North's saber rattling as largely bluster. South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, speaking with Kerry on Friday, urged North Korea to open talks. ""We urge North Korea to cease its reckless behavior and to stop issuing threats,"" he said. A joint statement issued by South Korea and the United States before Kerry's departure emphasized Washington's commitment to defending Seoul ""in the wake of recent unacceptable provocations"" by the North. Before departing for Beijing, Kerry attended a meet and greet, where he called the children of diplomats to join him on stage. He told the group that their work was about making the world a safer place for the children. ""This is one of the most important places on earth,"" he said, referring to the divided Korean Peninsula. It shows what life is like when people are presented with no choices."" North Korea issued a scathing warning to Japan on Friday, saying via its state news agency, KCNA , that Tokyo should ""stop recklessly working for staging a comeback on Korea, depending on its American master."" Japanese foreign minister spokesman Masaru Sato said such remarks only hurt North Korea. ""Japan would not be pushed around by rhetoric of North Korea,"" he said. Japan's Transport Ministry has issued a notice requiring its airplanes to report to the U.S. military if they fly near the U.S. military's Kadena base in Okinawa prefecture, the Kyodo News Agency said. The notice, made at the request of the U.S. military in Japan, is believed to be part of precautions taken against possible North Korean missile launches.

"(AOL Autos) -- Meet today's most powerful production cars. Call your banker: The 2008 Lamborghini Murcielago LP640 costs more than $313,000 . Today, we are experiencing the automobile world's Age of Superlative Speed. During no other decade have so many cars offered so much speed. The secret behind the speed is power, because to go fast you need horsepower...and lots of it. We took a look at the most powerful (and fastest) production vehicles sold in the United States plus the technology that makes the power possible. Want Horsepower? Bring money. There is a direct link between big horsepower and big money. The reason is simple; to make a reliable 600+ horsepower engine costs tens (or even hundreds) of thousands of dollars. Then you must wrap the engine in a vehicle capable of handling that prodigious power -- another hugely expensive proposition because to be safe at high speeds requires a sophisticated chassis, huge brakes and NASA-quality aerodynamics. The Horsepower per Dollar Champion Dodge Viper SRT-10  The first member of our 600+ Horsepower Club is the 2008 Dodge Viper SRT-10. It's also the value champion, with a list price of under $85,000. An 8.4-liter cam-in-block, two-valve per-cylinder V-10 produces exactly 600 horsepower the old-fashioned way, with lots of displacement -- not fancy technology. For those who still appraise engines in cubic inches, the V-10 measures out at 512 cubic inches. What does so much horsepower feel like? Of all the cars listed in this story, your author has only put significant miles on the Viper. We measured its limits at a Detroit drag strip where we experienced an epiphany of power. After completing ¼-mile runs in less than 11.8 seconds at over 123 mph, we now understand the lust unadulterated that power creates. Left to run, the Viper's top speed is over 200 mph. 2008 Mercedes SL 65 AMG  If your tastes are more sophisticated than the Detroit-born and built Viper, perhaps you'll appreciate the Mercedes SL 65 AMG hard-top roadster. It's 6.0-liter V-12 is fitted with twin turbochargers to produce 604 horsepower and a staggering 738 ft-lb of torque. The engine's technology and the car's formidable provenance command a list price of almost $190,000. 2008 Mercedes S & CL 65 AMG Mercedes-Benz spent considerable engineering research and development dollars developing their hugely powerful V-12, so this engine finds its way into many of the company's highest performing models, including the handsome Mercedes S 65 AMG Sedan and Mercedes CL 65 AMG Coupe (both cost around $200k). In these configurations, the engine produces 612 horsepower. Top speed (as with many high-performance German cars) is electronically limited to 155 mph. 2008 Maybach 62 and 57 In case you didn't know, Mercedes-Benz owns Maybach. This division is for Mercedes what Lexus is to Toyota. Not surprisingly, Maybach makes use of the same 612-horse twin-turbo V-12 found in powerful Mercedes to propel the stately 62 and 57 limousine-like sedans. These ultra rare, ultra premium, and ultra powerful sedans are available at ultra prices ranging between $350,000-$440,000. 2008 Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren What do you get when you combine racing technology with supreme luxury? The Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. McLaren is famous in racing series the world over for their advanced engineering, and the company's partnership with Mercedes resulted in the SLR. This 617-horsepower, 212 mph automotive arrow carries a list price of just under half a million. The power comes from a supercharged 5.5-liter V-8. 2008 Ferrari 599 Producing 620 horsepower at a screaming 7600 RPM, the 6-liter V-12 in the Ferrari 599 is the most powerful engine the legendary Italian company has ever let loose on the streets. With a top speed of 200+ mph and the ability to reach 60 mph in 3.5 seconds, the 599 is among the world's most impressive performers, especially at its list price of $302,584. 2008 Lamborghini Murcielago LP640 The horsepower war isn't just global, it's local. Ferrari and Lamborghini have been battling it out for Italian bragging rights since the 1960s. Currently, Lambo is on top with their 632-horsepower 6.5-liter V-12 found in their Murcielago coupe and roadster LP640 models. Audi now owns the Italian automaker, so quality is solid. Prepare to spend $313,600 for a coupe, more for a roadster. Bugatti Veyron 16.4 The Bugatti Veyron bends the mind in so many ways. First, its horsepower 1001 eclipses every other production car on the planet. The engine displaces 8 liters (less than the Dodge Viper) but utilizes 16 cylinders configured as a W (actually twin off-set V-8 engines that share a common crankshaft). There are four turbochargers. The Veyron's top speed has been confirmed by multiple sources to be over 250 mph, attainable only after utilizing the car's ""top speed key."" At this speed, the car burns 2.46 miles per gallon. This land-bound missile figuratively blasts off from a stop with a sophisticated all-wheel-drive system, reaching 60 mph in 2.5 seconds (say, ""one Mississippi, two Mississippi."") With the exchange rate what it is, check with your banker, as you'll need approximately $1.5 million to put the German-built Bugatti Veyron 16.4 in your estate's carriage house (or under the car port of your apartment). With a 10-percent down, your monthly outlay over 60 months at 6.75% interest will be an affordable $26,572 prior to tax and title fees. Coming Soon: Corvette ZR1 Introduced at the 2008 Detroit Auto Show this past January, the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 will be unleashed with a supercharged V-8 producing at least 620 horsepower when it goes on sale this fall. Expect phenomenal performance with a top speed in excess of 200 mph at a relatively affordable price of around $100,000. (Chevy always did know how to deliver value.) Not quite production, but over 600 HP Most every American enthusiast knows about the $42,000 Mustang Shelby GT500. Its supercharged V-8 thumps out 500 horsepower. However, today there are dozens of equally powerful cars, so 500 ponies isn't much to brag about. A trip to Carroll Shelby's Las Vegas workshop with your GT500 and $28,000 gets you a 100 horsepower boost. Congratulations: For $70,000, you've discovered the cheapest way into the 600 Horsepower Club.","Making a 600+ horsepower engine can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars .

"(CNN) -- Militants who control parts of Somalia's capital city are beating women in broad daylight for violating their radical brand of Islamic law, according to local officials and witnesses in Mogadishu. ""Just today, Al-Shabaab dispatched men with whips to the streets around Bakara market and they are flogging any woman who is found not wearing socks,"" according to a female maize trader at the Mogadishu market, who spoke Thursday. She did not want to be named for security reasons. In the past two days, more than 130 people, including women who were not wearing headscarves and men chewing dried khat leaves, have been detained for violating Al-Shabaab's interpretation of sharia, or Islamic law, according to witnesses and officials. Hooded Al-Shabaab gunmen rounded up 50 women on Wednesday from Mogadishu's Bakara market for not wearing the veil that is required for women under some interpretations of Islamic law, according to the maize trader. ""Most of these women were vegetable traders, so they are poor and can't afford to buy veils for 600,000 shillings [about $23 U.S.],"" she said. She said she saw more women being detained Thursday. Another 80 Somali civilians were detained in the southwestern town of Luuq, near the Kenyan and Ethiopian border, ""because they turned deaf ear to orders we imposed on the town,"" said the local Al-Shabaab commander Sheikh Hussien al-Iraqi. Al-Shabaab is considered a terrorist organization by the United States because of its ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. It has been imposing stricter rules on Somali civilians living in the areas it controls. Earlier this month, Al-Shabaab militants whipped women for wearing bras in an area of northern Mogadishu that they control, shocking residents who have been besieged by the ongoing insurgency. The militants believe the female undergarments are a deception to men.","Militant group Al-Shabaab imposes strict interpretation of law in areas it controls .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Officials had power fully restored Sunday afternoon after a 6.5-magnitude earthquake off the northern California coast Saturday left thousands without electricity. The quake, which ran about 13.5 miles deep, hit at 4:27 p.m. Saturday, about 33 miles from the coastal city of Eureka, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Nearly a dozen aftershocks followed, the strongest at 4.5 magnitude. They continued into the early morning hours Sunday. David Eisenhower, spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric Company, said power had been restored to all customers Sunday afternoon. About 28,000 customers, most in Humboldt County, were initially without power. The company launched helicopters Sunday morning to patrol for gas leaks at the transmission lines that run through remote areas, he said, adding there have been no reports of such leaks. There were no reports of serious injuries or damage. See iReports from areas affected by earthquake . St. Joseph Hospital in Eureka said it treated several people for minor quake-related injuries, but none were significant enough for the patient to be admitted. Chris Durant, a reporter for the Eureka Times-Standard, said he was working on the second floor of the newspaper's concrete building when he and his colleagues felt the earthquake. ""We are used to feeling small ones,"" he said, ""but after the first few seconds, we looked at each other and said, 'This is not a small one.'"" Eureka resident Cole Machado told CNN he was talking on the phone when he felt the ground shake. ""I thought my TV was going to fall over."" Tom Grinsell, the fire chief in the nearby town of Ferndale, said it was ""one of the strongest quakes I remember in quite a while. I assumed it was going to be a lot worse than we're seeing."" He said the quake had a ""strong shaking to it and was rather lengthy."" Grinsell said his department has received numerous calls about broken glass, emptied shelves, and stucco and plaster knocked off walls. He added that the damage is cosmetic and that no buildings have collapsed. Grinsell said officials have asked residents to stay off the roads because of debris, and to conserve water until it's certain there is no damage to the water system. Ferndale resident Jessica Stephens Tucker described the movement from the temblor: ""It rolled and rolled and then it slammed.""

"(CNN) -- American student Amanda Knox, convicted last year of murdering her British roommate in Italy, was ordered Monday to face a new trial on slander charges, her lawyer Luciano Ghirga said. She and her parents are accused of defaming Italian police in the wake of her arrest for the killing of Meredith Kercher. Monday's hearing determined that there is enough evidence to try her. The case involves her allegations that police mistreated her in custody. Her parents face charges for repeating Knox's allegations. Her stepfather, Chris Mellas, called Monday's ruling ""a forgone conclusion."" He pointed out that Knox was facing a judge and prosecutor who had been involved in the case before. ""Was there ever hope for an unbiased ruling with this line up? There never was any in our eyes,"" he told CNN. ""We will be asking that the case be... moved to Florence"" because the family considers the court system in Perugia to be biased, he said. ""Amanda made a statement today in court and in that statement she was clear as to her position,"" he said. ""She never wanted to make unjust accusations. She only wanted to defend herself, and had the police recorded the interrogation, she would not be in this mess today, and her position and statements would be confirmed by those recordings."" Mellas said Knox did not claim to have been ""beaten"" by police, but hit on the back of the head. Knox wore black pants and a dark green sweater for her court appearance in Perugia, Italy. She wore her short hair pulled back from her face. The defamation trial is set to begin May 17, 2011, Ghirga, the lawyer, said. Knox, 23, is also planning an appeal of her murder conviction. The appeal is due to begin November 24. Knox was sentenced in December to 26 years in prison for the murder of the British exchange student in Perugia, Italy. Kercher, 21, was found semi-naked with her throat slashed in the house she shared with Knox in November 2007. Knox and her former Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 26, were both found guilty of Kercher's murder. Sollecito is serving a 25-year sentence. A third person, Rudy Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, was tried separately and is serving a 16-year prison sentence.","NEW: There was never hope of an unbiased hearing, her stepfather says .

"(CNN) -- Pakistanis cast ballots in Karachi on Sunday, a day after the slaying of a well-known political leader who had accused rivals of vote rigging. As voters headed to polls, accusations flew over Zahra Shahid Hussain's death. Sources said an execution-style attack on the eve of the election killed Hussain, a senior vice president of the Tehreek-e-Insaf party, or PTI. The party made headlines after nationwide elections on May 11, alleging vote rigging in Karachi and elsewhere. Amid the allegations, election officials held a revote Sunday for one National Assembly seat and two Provincial Assembly seats in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. Unofficial results from the country's election commission showed that PTI candidate Arif Alvi won the National Assembly seat. Former cricket star Imran Khan, who heads the PTI party, blamed the leader of the rival MQM party for Hussain's death, accusing him of making inflammatory speeches threatening PTI workers and leaders. ""I hold (MQM leader) Altaf Hussain directly responsible for the murder,"" Khan said in a Twitter post. Officials from the MQM, one of Pakistan's largest and most liberal parties, denied responsibility and sharply criticized Khan. ""The comments are absolutely baseless and are totally without foundation, made out of frustration from a man who has lost the election,"" said Mohammed Anwar, head of international relations for the MQM. Anwar said Altaf Hussain, the MQM's London-based leader, was the first person to condemn the killing. Khan's comments, Anwar said, show a man lashing out. ""Within minutes of the murder, he was making accusations,"" Anwar said. ""How did he found out so quickly after the event and issue a statement?"" MQM leaders called for a protest against Khan's ""hasty"" allegations. The long road ahead for Pakistan's comeback king: Nawaz Sharif . Political killings escalating . Pakistan has seen a rise in targeted killings in recent years across the political spectrum. A gunman on a motorbike killed a parliamentary candidate and his young child in March in Karachi. Sadiq Zaman Khattak, a representative of the liberal, anti-Taliban Awami National Party, was leaving a mosque with his 4-year-old son when an assassin shot them both. No one owned up to the attack, but the Taliban have threatened Khattak's party and have claimed responsibility for some deadly attacks against its members and other politicians. On the day Khattak was killed, gunmen elsewhere ambushed and killed a top prosecutor, Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali. At the time, he was trying a case stemming from the death of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who had been assassinated while campaigning for her party. Ali was heading to court when attackers opened fire on his car as it passed through an Islamabad neighborhood. The ambush also wounded his bodyguard, whom authorities assigned to protect him after he received threats from the Pakistani Taliban. Meanwhile on Sunday, family, friends and members of the PTI party attended Hussain's funeral. She was buried not far from her home in Karachi. Pakistan votes: Key moments of a turbulent past . British police investigating . Since 1991, the MQM political movement's leader has lived in London. Altaf Hussain sought political asylum in the United Kingdom ""because of an attack on his life,"" according to a statement on the party's website. London's Metropolitan Police Service said Sunday that it was investigating complaints about alleged comments made by someone associated with the MQM but did not provide additional details. ""We are in the early stages of the investigation and are assessing the information which has now been brought to our attention,"" the agency said in a statement. ""We take all allegations of crime seriously and will respond appropriately to the concerns raised and will take action where appropriate."" The British Foreign Office condemned the Pakistani political leader's murder.

"Washington (CNN) -- When Sen. Mark Begich looks at the next two years, he says he is not concerned about the tough votes he is bound to have to make that could have an impact on his re-election in 2014. The moderate Democrat from Alaska even laughs a bit when he says, ""Every vote we take here is tough."" ""My strategy has always been to do what I am going to do and focus on my issues,"" Begich said in an interview with CNN. Begich is one of six moderate Democrats from ""red"" states whose terms ends in two years. Max Baucus of Montana, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas are among the 20 Democrats whose terms will be up in 2014; Republicans will defend 13 seats. CNN Election Center: Complete results . Though no Republican has declared a run against Begich, speculation in Alaska is that Gov. Sean Parnell will challenge the first-term senator. Since 2008, when the former Anchorage mayor narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Ted Stevens, Begich has voted as a moderate and has shown willingness to work with the other party. At times, he says, that can get lonely: ""You feel like a Lone Ranger sometimes."" Asked about positions he has taken on oil and drilling or on transportation in the 112th Congress, Begich said, ""Sometimes I feel like I look around and I look behind me and there aren't many national Democrats there. But that is the way it goes."" Though fiscal cliff and budget issues are likely to dominate Congress' lame duck session -- and likely the new Congress -- there are any number of issues that could emerge in President Barack Obama's second term that could test moderate Democrats. Much has been made of liberal Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin elected to the Senate last week and both parties being pulled away from the middle, but Begich points out that moderate Democrats Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana also were elected. 2014 battle for the Senate starts now . Senate votes will be heavily scrutinized in midterms . But Begich's optimism may not be well-founded -- the reality, says Nathan Gonzales from the Rothenberg Political Report, is that even the most benign votes Begich and his fellow moderates make will be used against them in 2014. ""Senators that are up for re-election are up under a larger microscope. Their votes will be dissected even more closely when they are in cycle,"" Gonzales said. Joe Manchin of West Virginia fired a warning shot -- literally -- to his fellow Democrats when the former governor was running against Republican businessman John Raese in the special election to fill the remainder of the late Sen. Robert Byrd's term. In a 30-second statewide TV ad, Manchin fired a bullet through a symbol of the House-passed cap-and-trade legislation -- a bill incredibly unpopular in his coal-rich state -- thereby both highlighting his opposition to the proposal and trumpeting his support of Second amendment rights. Democrats may also be emboldened by the way voters in some states last week supported Democrats in the Senate even while voting for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney. ""We learned from Tuesday's results that voters are willing to split their tickets,"" Gonzales said. In Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, all states in which Romney outran Obama by more than 10 points, Democrats won Senate seats. Though ill-chosen comments on rape by Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana helped the Democrats in each case, Landrieu's chief of staff, Jane Campbell, is encouraged. Though she did not guarantee victory -- ""I am not telling you that it is going to be easy. Her races have never been easy,"" Campbell said -- she did sound confident. Landrieu ""has run three times in a state that has always had a Republican lean, and her numbers have gone up every single time,"" Campbell said. Every election ""she has always been among the top targets and she has always shown the people of Louisiana and they have asked her to come back."" Campbell noted the senator focuses on issues that her constituents care about, singling out protecting the state's bayous, holding BP oil company responsible for recovery from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, and education. New U.S. House: Women and minorities to the left; white men to the right . Focusing on issues important to constituents . Begich took the same tack -- listing issues like oil and natural gas, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and transportation -- as his selling points to Alaskan voters. Throughout the conversation he mentioned issues most Democrats wouldn't touch, like auditing the Federal Reserve, strengthening gun rights and lowering the corporate tax rate. Begich's strategy seems clear -- focus on issues that matter to Alaskans for the last two years of his term. ""I always run like I am 15 points behind. You always run hard,"" Begich said. ""I am focused in the last several years on the issues that matter to Alaska."" But how does that jibe with the wider Democratic caucus? When the 113th Congress is commenced in January, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will have to unite his caucus. With a mixed bag of priorities, and a handful of more moderate members focusing on getting re-elected in 2014, that could prove taxing. ""Leader Reid has a difficult task and I think the president is going to be looking to define his legacy,"" Gonzalez said. ""I think he is going to try to get something big done that is going to have political consequences. The ones who have the most on the line are the people who will face voters in the midterm."" Jim Manley, who used to work as the chief spokesman for Reid, said he expects that the majority leader is going to go out of his way to make sure every Democrat feels comfortable with each vote. ""There are different ways to juggle votes,"" Manley said. ""In the end, Reid understands that they have to do what they have to do to get re-elected. Reid understands that they need to do what they have to do to represent their constituents."" After all, Manley pointed out, Reid has had to do this ever since becoming majority leader in 2006. ""He spent the last couple of years juggling the competing concerns of (moderates) Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson against the demands of (progressives) Sherrod Brown and Bernie Sanders."" Begich says he assured Reid before the 2012 elections that he is ready to take hard votes and that the leader doesn't have to worry about putting him in a tough spot. Even so, said a confident Begich, he likes where he is two years out from the election. ""Some of the guys who were running for re-election (in 2012) had to moderate in my direction,"" Begich said. ""I came in with these positions already because that is who I am.""","With both parties being pulled away from the middle, Senate Dems face uphill climb in '14 .

"(CNN) -- Ireland stepped up its battle with the Roman Catholic Church over child abuse Sunday, with Justice Minister Alan Shatter vowing to pass a law requiring priests to report suspicions of child abuse, even if they learn about them in confession. The Catholic Church regards information learned in confession as completely confidential. But under the law proposed by Shatter, priests could be prosecuted for failing to tell the police about crimes disclosed in the confession box. Shatter said in a statement through a spokesman last week that priests' failure to report what they learn in confession ""has led sexual predators into believing that they have impunity and facilitated pedophiles preying on children and destroying their lives."" The minister's comment to a local radio station Sunday comes after the Vatican rejected Irish accusations that church leaders sought to cover up extensive abuse of young people by priests in Ireland. Saturday's 25-page statement is the latest development in a row that has seen an unprecedented rift open up between the Vatican and Ireland, a heavily Roman Catholic country. ""The Holy See does not accept that it was somehow indifferent to the plight of those who suffered abuse in Ireland,"" the statement says. Rather, it says, the Holy See ""devoted considerable attention to the Irish situation,"" through meetings with Irish bishops and directions given by the Pope to Irish church leaders. The Vatican response says ""the accusation that the Holy See attempted to frustrate an inquiry in a sovereign democratic republic is unfounded."" The Vatican response follows a biting attack by Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny in the wake of the Cloyne report, published in July, which investigated abuses in the diocese of Cloyne, near the southern city of Cork. After the publication of the Cloyne report, Kenny said: ""The law of the land should not be stopped by a crozier or a collar,"" referring to the hooked staff held by Catholic bishops during religious services and the collar worn by priests. Addressing lawmakers, Kenny claimed the report exposed the Vatican as trying to hinder an inquiry into child sex abuse for its own benefit and said it revealed the ""dysfunction, the disconnection, the elitism that dominate the culture of the Vatican to this day."" Irish lawmakers then passed a motion deploring ""the Vatican's intervention which contributed to the undermining of the child protection framework and guidelines of the Irish State and the Irish Bishops."" The Vatican responded to the criticism by Kenny and other Irish lawmakers by recalling its envoy to Ireland, Archbishop Giuseppe Leanza. It said in its statement Saturday that many of the criticisms and allegations made against it in the Cloyne report appear to result from an incorrect reading of a 1997 letter to Irish bishops from the Vatican's envoy to Ireland at the time -- although it acknowledges the letter is open to ""misinterpretation"" if taken out of context. Detailing letters and reports issued by the Vatican, it questions the conclusions drawn by investigators as to the Church's approach to dealing with complaints of abuse by priests. The Vatican also expresses its regret for the abuses committed, acknowledges instances were sometimes mishandled and says it is confident new measures brought in in Ireland and elsewhere will prevent such ""deplorable acts"" recurring. ""In a spirit of humility, the Holy See, while rejecting unfounded accusations, welcomes all objective and helpful observations and suggestions to combat with determination the appalling crime of sexual abuse of minors,"" the statement says. The Vatican response was welcomed by the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Cardinal Sean Brady. ""The reply conveys the profound abhorrence of the Holy See for the crime of sexual abuse and its sorrow and shame for the terrible sufferings which the victims of abuse and their families have endured within the Church of Jesus Christ, a place where this should never happen,"" he said in an online statement. Released July 13, the 421-page report into the handling of abuses in the diocese of Cloyne demolished claims by the Catholic Church in Ireland that policies it put in place in 1996 had enabled it to get a handle on the problem. It also accused Bishop John Magee, who was responsible for policing abuse in his diocese, of not backing the policies himself and failing to take action against abusers. The report detailed how complaints against 19 clerics in the diocese were dealt with between 1996 and 2009 by church and state authorities. Journalist Peter Taggart contributed to this report.","Ireland will pass a law forcing priests to reveal abuse disclosed in confession, the justice minister says .

"MIAMI (CNN) -- When ""Marta"" was 12, she entered the United States illegally, hoping to join her mother, who had left her in Central America years ago to search for work. Three years later she was sitting in immigration detention by herself waiting to be deported back home to her grandmother, who was dying of cancer. ""Marta"" was 12 when she came to the U.S. illegally and alone. She had something most kids don't -- an attorney. Her case is typical of the 7,211 children known to have entered the United States illegally in 2008 by themselves, according to the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, which runs the shelters where the children are detained. Children come searching for family members or a way out of poverty with little understanding of the legal ramifications they face. Marta had something not every child in those circumstances receives -- legal representation. A lawyer employed by the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, a nonprofit legal assistance group, took her case. It made the difference between being deported and getting a shot at a visa. But not every child will go before a judge with a lawyer. Last year, as many as 50 percent of the children detained went before judges with no lawyer, according to Wendy Young, director of Kids in Need of Defense. She says it could get worse, because the organizations that provide free legal defense for these children are struggling financially and cutting back.  Go inside a secure, children's detention center » . ""The impact [of having fewer legal services] would be devastating, because these are children who can't get through legal proceedings alone. It's just not realistic,"" said Young, who added that there have been cases where babies were carried into court to face judges without lawyers. The Office of Refugee Resettlement did provide $5 million to the Vera Institute, a nonprofit organization that works with the government on justice policy. Vera used that money to help 14 nonprofit organizations provide legal information to children of all ages, but the government is barred by law from providing actual representation to detained children, according to Maureen Dunn, director of the Unaccompanied Children's Services Program for the resettlement office. ""They are children and they don't understand procedures and immigration laws, there are some very arcane laws ... and we help them break down a complex process,"" said Dunn, who said she believes no more than 30 percent of detained immigrant children face judges without lawyers. In Marta's case, her lawyer, Michelle Abarca, determined during interviews with her that she had no place to go home to and no safe place to live in the United States. She argued in court that Marta qualified for a special visa for children who have been abused, abandoned or neglected and need the protection of the United States. She now lives in a foster home in Florida and has a U.S. visa. Dunn says the government's goal is to demystify the legal process for children by teaching them about the legal process and determine which children might qualify for relief and need representation. ""They are very vulnerable in a system that was created for adults,"" said Susan Shah, director of the Vera program. Shah said the program then tries to connect the children with lawyers willing to work free, either with the support of their law firms or through groups like Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center. But services are not always available. The advocacy center represented 400 children this year, but Cheryl Little, the center's executive director, said its chief funder, Florida Children's Trust, is making severe cutbacks. The trust funds programs for children from money levied through real estate taxes and a bad economy has created deep reductions. U.S. Senator former child refugee of Operation Pedro Pan . ""We're in the red by at least $400,000. We're looking at layoffs, cutting salaries, benefits and freezing positions we need,"" said Little, whose group represented Marta. ""It means the lifeline we now extend to children won't be there. It means that kids will get sent to bad circumstances when they may qualify for the protection of this country. It breaks my heart to think of the consequences."" Angelina Jolie and Microsoft help fund Kids in Need of Defense. The group worked with 1,000 pro bono lawyers this year and trained them to represent children facing immigration hearings. But volunteer lawyers without day-to-day experience in immigration are not necessarily a replacement for lawyers versed in complicated immigration law, according to Young. ""Getting a good defense can literally mean the difference between life and death for a child who is fleeing war or is the victim of human trafficking,"" Young said. Marta, whose lawyer has handled as many as 100 clients at once, still depends on her attorney to guide her through the legal process that lies ahead. ""I'll be OK,"" said Marta. ""Because I have my lawyer and my God.""","""Marta"" was 12 when she came to the U.S. illegally to find her mother .

"(CNN) -- A Soyuz spacecraft carrying two cosmonauts and an U.S. astronaut from the International Space Station landed successfully in Kazakhstan early Saturday morning, NASA said. The trio spent 176 days in space. Their return was delayed by a day after an undocking glitch, NASA said.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- The three largest U.S. cellular carriers by subscribers sell the latest iPhone, and next week, eighth-place C Spire Wireless will join the group. Some people were taken aback this week when C Spire, which only has stores in Mississippi, Southwest Alabama and Southwest Tennessee, announced that it will begin carrying the iPhone 4 and 4S on November 11. Among those grumbling over the news were some of T-Mobile USA's 33.6 million subscribers. How, they asked, could a regional carrier get the coveted product before one of the big four? C Spire's infrastructure is based on a cell standard used by Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel, which now both have the iPhone, but it is not common in other countries. C Spire, formerly Cellular South, has a deal with Verizon so that customers who travel outside of its Mississippi home base can still make calls. Since C Spire's network uses the same underpinnings and antenna bands as Verizon, Apple did not have to make modifications to its phones beyond what it already did for Verizon when it launched there in February. An Apple spokeswoman confirmed that C Spire would begin selling the phone next week, but she did not respond to a question about whether the company needed to modify the hardware. The iPhone 4S, Apple's newest gadget, uses a special antenna receiver from Qualcomm that works on typically incompatible networks. ""IPhone 4S is now a world phone, so both GSM and CDMA customers can roam worldwide on GSM networks,"" Bob Mansfield, Apple's head of hardware engineering, says in a promotional video. T-Mobile's network runs on the global standard called GSM. AT&T Mobility also uses GSM. That's what makes T-Mobile an attractive takeover target for AT&T, which plans to bolster its own network using T-Mobile cell towers, as long as the merger is approved. (C Spire, along with Sprint, are suing to block the acquisition, saying it will reduce competition.) While AT&T and T-Mobile use the same basic network infrastructure, their cell signals operate on different antenna bands. That prevents T-Mobile from easily making iPhones run on its network. When asked why C Spire got the iPhone before T-Mobile, Brad Duea, a T-Mobile senior vice-president, smiled, having likely fielded the question before. ""The iPhone already works with their bands,"" he said in an interview on Wednesday. ""They didn't have to change anything."" Since the original iPhone came out in 2007, owners have been able to take the devices to T-Mobile, swap out a SIM card and use them on the network. But as Apple has added 3G and faster data speeds for AT&T, the unofficial T-Mobile iPhones -- more than a million in all, T-Mobile has said -- have not been able to exceed 2G speeds. AT&T's and T-Mobile's 3G and so-called 4G networks operate on different bands. Another T-Mobile executive, Cole Brodman, recently addressed the issue publicly at a conference and in a letter to customers, though not in great deal. Executives say that, while they'd like to have the iPhone, Android is a fine alternative to the iPhone.","C Spire Wireless will be the fourth U.S. carrier to get the iPhone .

"LOS ANGELES, California -- On Earth Day on Wednesday, Dr. David Jentsch marched at the head of a column of UCLA students and faculty members to the chant of, ""Stand up for science!"" Across the street a smaller but equally vocal group of animal rights advocates chanted, ""U-C-L-A, how many animals have you killed today!"" Animal rights activists say large numbers of animals are killed each year during medical trials. Until recently, Jentsch had never dreamed he would lead a political demonstration. But Jentsch's life took a sharp turn last month when his car was firebombed in his driveway. A radical group of animal rights activists claimed responsibility for the act. ""This is terror,"" Jentsch said. ""There is no two ways about it. It's extremism. It's an attempt to intimidate."" It was the latest in a string of arson attacks against UCLA researchers who use animals in medical research projects. Since 2006, there have been seven attacks aimed at researcher's homes or cars. No arrests have been made in the cases, which are being investigated by an FBI lead task force on terrorism. ""We believe it's just a matter of time before someone is going to be hurt,"" said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Salvador Hernandez. ""The intent of these groups is to intimidate and coerce."" Hernandez heads up the task force investigating the series of attacks and says their actions qualify as terrorist attacks. But animal rights advocate Chris DeRose says nothing could be further from the truth . ""There has never been one human being in this country being killed or even hurt,"" he said. He believes the university researchers are the bad guys. ""What I do condemn is what goes on behind those walls,"" he says. DeRose, founder of Last Chance for Animals, says he doesn't condone firebombing researchers' homes, but he doesn't condemn it either.  Watch people against animal research at protest » . ""The reason these people are doing it is because they have been pushed ... nobody is listening ... over a hundred million animals a year are killed in universities and major hospitals in this country,"" he said. Jentsch argues that same medical research using lab animals has lead to many medical breakthroughs that benefit mankind. UCLA points to research advances in breast cancer treatments, Parkinson's disease and artificial heart technology that relied on experiments involving lab animals at their California facilities. Jentsch's own research involves studies aimed at treating drug addiction in humans. He studies the brains of monkeys that have been injected with methamphetamine. He says his experiments are peer-reviewed and adhere strictly to established rules for the treatment of lab animals.  Watch supporters of animal research at protest » . Jentsch says that he hopes that this week's dueling demonstrations can lead to a dialogue. He believes many of the protestors voicing opposition to the UCLA labs do not endorse the string of violent acts aimed against him and other researchers, ""but it is essential for them to repudiate this type of activity."" In the meantime, Jentsch says he refuses to be intimidated. ""I'm going to continue to live where I live, continue to educate people about my work,"" he said. ""I'm not going to stop.""","Dr. David Jentsch joins protest after his car was firebombed last month .

"(CNN) -- Republican Sen. Rob Portman's flip-flop approval for same-sex marriage, is just the latest change of heart on the issue by conservatives. Even Democrats like President Obama -- have turned around after opposing it. This change in attitude is just one of many milestones for the movement. Here are five of the most important turning points in the same-sex marriage debate: . 1993: In a landmark case, Hawaii's Supreme Court ruled that the state can't deny same-sex couples the right to marry unless it finds ""a compelling reason"" to do so. It orders the issue back to the state legislature, which then voted to ban gay marriage. This was one of earliest debates on the issue at the state level, and was a precursor to the legal battles nationwide. Today, domestic partnerships and civil unions for same-sex couples are legal in Hawaii. 1996: President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, -- which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman. The law denies federal benefits to same-sex couples in the nine states where gay marriage is legal. Clinton said he signed it because it would have tamped down calls for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. Only 81 out of 535 members of Congress opposed DOMA. Fast-forward seventeen years to March 2013, when Clinton urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA. He explained: ""As the president who signed the act into law, I have come to believe that DOMA is contrary to those principles and, in fact, incompatible with our Constitution."" 2004: President Bush championed a constitutional amendment that would outlaw gay marriage. It was needed, he said, to stop ""activist judges"" from redefining marriage. The idea found support among Senate conservatives, but its supporters couldn't gather enough votes. By the way, all this unfolded during a contentious presidential campaign. Democratic White House hopefuls Sens. John Kerry and John Edwards opposed the amendment, but they also were against creating a specific law making same-sex marriage legal. 2012: For the first time, voters approved same-sex marriage statewide at the ballot box. Similar measures had been rejected for years. Same-sex couples became free to marry in Maryland, Maine and Washington. Gay rights supporters also scored a smaller victory in Minnesota, where voters rejected a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. Interestingly, support for same-sex marriage came from a mixed coalition of voters. Before 2012, six states had already legalized gay marriage -- but via courts and legislatures -- not voters. 2013: For the first time, the Obama administration joined the legal battle against California's 2008 same-sex marriage ban. The Justice Department made it official in February when it filed a brief to the Supreme Court. The Obama administration urged the high court to invalidate the ban.

"(TIME) -- Google Maps' Street View is becoming less and less about photographing the road to grandma's house and more about getting you off the road entirely. The tech giant's latest project, unveiled Monday, takes mapping initiatives to new and extreme heights by offering interactive galleries of some of the world's tallest mountains. The views include four famous peaks from across the globe: the snow-capped Everest Base Camp in Asia's Himalayas, dormant volcano Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, Mount Elbrus in Europe and Aconcagua in Pope Francis' home country of Argentina. Users can drop into various camps and viewing locations along the mountains to explore 360-degree panoramas and trace the paths of some mountains' trails with just a few clicks. ""It feels like you're walking through the gates of hell because there are mule skeletons sticking out of the ground,"" Dan Fredinburg, one of the Google team members who photographed all four peaks, says about his experience at Aconcagua. ""It was this out-of-world experience of entering into an environment where not many people go and knowing we were going to bring back that experience for others to see."" (VIDEO: Google Street View Lets You Explore the Grand Canyon) Fredinburg is a Google Adventurer. That's not his normal title — he's a technical program manager who works on Google's privacy and security team — but his love of the extreme outdoors led him and his colleagues to start organizing visits to the highest mountains throughout the past year and a half. As they planned, another colleague suggested using their trip as an opportunity to collaborate with the Google Maps team, and their modern-day cartography mission was born. Google Maps uses a variety of devices besides cars to capture footage from all over the world, including pushcart trolleys, trikes and, on occasion, snowmobiles. Cliffside hiking, however, required a different strategy. The Trekker — the backpack camera apparatus Google used to photograph its Grand Canyon collection, which debuted in February — had yet to be invented when Fredinburg and friends set their sights on some summits. Scaling the world's highest peaks is also an equipment-heavy undertaking, which means lugging around backpack-sized cameras wasn't feasible. Instead, the adventurers went fairly low-tech, using an off-the-self digital camera and fish-eye lens — the same tools Google's Business Photos program has used to capture the interiors of more than 100,000 businesses since it launched three years ago. ""The fish-eye camera does allow you to get some amazing views, and it allows you to take photos a little bit more aggressively because you don't need to stop and aim as well,"" Fredinburg tells TIME. ""You just hold the camera in a direction, even if you're precariously perched on the edge of a mountain."" (VIDEO: Google Street View Lets Users Virtually Dive the Great Barrier Reef) Precarious indeed. The mountain peak collection was one of Google's trickiest mapping projects to photograph, as the adventure team dealt with torrential downpours, mudslides and even a 6.9-magnitute earthquake near Everest in the middle of the night. Working in Google's Mountain View, Calif. headquarters means Fredinburg is no stranger to West Coast quakes, but when your lodging in Nepal consists of seismically unsound trading posts built out of stones, natural disasters are a whole other story. ""As I was out in the dark, you could hear people screaming and running for cover. That is an eye-opening experience,"" Fredinburg says. ""These people accept their fate as predetermined. To see them panicking and fearing something, it tests your own ability to stay calm in situations like that and not panic as well."" The mountains' high altitudes were another obstacle, one that required careful planning. At any given spot on the mountain, adventurers only need to take a few shots — three leveled photographs in each compass direction. But when you have to do that every 20 feet without your normal supply of oxygen, capturing the (literally!) breathtaking beauty of geological wonders becomes a demanding and time-consuming task, so Fredinburg and the other adventurers would meet at night to plot their itinerary, which usually began at first light. Fortunately for them, assembling all that data back in Mountain View was a far less rigorous task: Google engineers use their mapping software to link the photos to their shooting locations and string them together to create the panoramic paths users walk through. ""The goal as a team is to make sure we had the opportunity to provide users with maps that are more accurate and usable,"" Fredinburg says. ""Different adventurers and people who want to explore from the comfort of their homes have the opportunity to explore and see these different corners of the world.""

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has been called ""The King of Hearts"" by many of his countrymen, referring to what they believe are his compassionate attempts to reform his ultra-conservative kingdom. He used his power Monday to overturn a criminal court sentence of 60 lashes and a two-year travel ban imposed on female journalist Rosanna al-Yami. Under the travel ban, she could not have left Saudi Arabia. Al-Yami was sentenced for her work on an episode of the television show ""A Thick Red Line"" that featured a Saudi man who bragged about sexual escapades. The controversial show explores social taboos. It is carried by the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., for which al-Yami works as a coordinator and guest booker. ""King Abdullah's swift revocation of this punishment sends an important notice to the Saudi judicial system that it should not go after journalists for exercising free speech,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director for Human Rights Watch. ""King Abdullah should also overturn the sentence against the man at the center of the case, who had spoken about sex on a television show, and initiate reforms to strengthen the rights to freedom of expression and to a fair trial,"" Human Rights Watch said in a written statement. In the episode, the Saudi man, Mazen Abdul Jawad, 32, bragged about his sex life. Saudi authorities put him on trial and sentenced him to five years in prison and 1,000 lashes. Shortly afterward, the court sentenced al-Yami. Jawad's attorney, Suleiman al-Jumeii, said al-Yami was not involved in setting up the episode in which his client appeared. The lawyer said he is attempting to pursue an appeal for his client and get the case heard in a special court that deals only with media matters. ""A Thick Red Line"" caused an uproar in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia, where sharia, or Islamic law, is practiced. Pre-marital sex is illegal, and unrelated men and women are not permitted to mingle. Saudi authorities shut down Lebanese Broadcasting's offices in Jeddah and Riyadh after the interview aired a few months ago. The king's pardon of al-Yami was unusual, but it was not the first time he has stepped in. In late 2007, the king pardoned a woman who, although she had been gang-raped, was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison for appearing in public with an unrelated male, who also was pardoned, according to the Saudi justice minister. The king concluded in a letter pardoning the woman that her male companion, who was abducted along with her, had suffered torture along with her. Details of what happened to the two were not disclosed. Octavia Nasr, senior editor for Middle East affairs, contributed to this report.","Saudi king overturns journalist's sentence of 60 lashes, two-year travel ban .

"(CNN)  -- A wheel from the main landing gear of a Colgan Airlines passenger plane fell off and rolled away as the aircraft was landing in Buffalo, New York, earlier this week. A wheel fell off the landing gear of Q400 Bombardier upon landing on Colgan Flight 3268 earlier this week. On Thursday night, The Toronto Sun posted a video of the incident shot by a passenger on the Q400 Bombardier -- the same type of plane involved in a fatal Colgan Airlines crash three months ago, also on approach to Buffalo Niagara International Airport. The video shows the wheel touch down on the ground and then roll away, followed by metal parts that are meant to keep the wheels in place. The plane was towed to the gate, where everyone on board ""deplaned normally,"" said Joe Williams, a spokesman for Pinnacle Airlines, Colgan's parent company. ""At no time was any passenger or crew member at risk, nor were any injuries reported,"" Williams said of the Tuesday incident. ""The aircraft was properly maintained in accordance with the manufacturer and Federal Aviation Administration procedures."" Williams said the incident ""appears to have been caused by the failure of the outer wheel bearing ... the bearing was relatively new, having been on the aircraft for five weeks."" Colgan Flight 3268 originated in Newark, New Jersey. ""I was scared, and the other passengers looked worried, too,"" one passenger told the Toronto newspaper. ""For a moment, I thought the worst in that we may not make it."" Three months ago, Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed in nearby Clarence Center, New York, killing all 49 passengers and crew members aboard. One person was killed on the ground. Hearings about the cause of that accident have been held in Washington this week. Investigators have focused on pilot fatigue as a possible cause of the crash.","Wheel from main landing gear fell off as aircraft was landing earlier this week .

"(CNN) -- German giants Bayern Munich's march towards domestic domination continues unabated. Having wrapped up the Bundesliga title with six games left to play, the Bavarians have now booked their place in the German Cup final, thrashing Wolfsburg 6-1. The club's first ever treble is still within their grasp. Bayern are also sitting pretty in Europe having dismissed Juventus to take their place in the Champions League semifinals where they will face Barcelona. Pedro's Point of View: Do Bayern need Guardiola? In fact, things are going so well under manager Jupp Heynckes, some have questioned what incoming coach Pep Guardiola, who is set to take over in June, can do to improve them. Guardiola famously steered Barcelona to 14 titles in his four years at the club, including two triumphs in the Champions League. After a season's sabbatical Bayern won the race for his signature, but the 42-year-old might have a tough task on his hands if Bayern go on to pin down another two trophies between now and the season's end. They rarely looked in any trouble against Wolfsburg and went into a two-goal lead before halftime. Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic grabbed the opener, turning home Dutch international Arjen Robben's cross. Robben then found the net after a mistake in Wolfsburg's defense was pounced upon by Xherdan Shaqiri, who teed up his teammate. Diego pulled a goal back for the visitors but Shaqiri soon restored Bayern's two-goal cushion with a low drive. Mandzukic departed for Mario Gomez and the Germany striker netted a hat-trick inside six minutes to put an emphatic gloss on the result. Bayern will now face either Stuttgart or Freiburg in the final. They play on Wednesday night. In the English Premier League Arsenal's hopes of strengthening their grip on third place ahead of London rivals Chelsea and Tottenham in the race for Champions League football were dented by a 0-0 draw with Everton. The Merseyside club have an outside chance of making the top four themselves but will be equally disappointed with the stalemate. Arsenal's French striker Olivier Giroud missed the best chance of the game, firing wide from eight yards out when stretching to meet a Aaron Ramsey cross, while Ross Barkley went close for the visitors. The result means Arsenal remain third in the table, two points clear of both their London rivals but they have played a game more than Chelsea and two more than Tottenham. Everton are sixth, two points behind Chelsea in fourth. Despite the draw Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was confident they are on course to make the Champions League for the 16th successive season under his stewardship. He told Sky Sports: ""We're in a strong position but let's win the next game. As you can see we are ready for a fight and if we keep this fighting spirit I'm sure we will get there."" His opposite number David Moyes added: ""The games are running out now so it's harder and harder for us to get into the top four. ""Probably we will get talked about at the end of conversations about the Champions League as we are rank outsiders. But there's no shame in getting a draw here.""","Bayern Munich thrash Wolfsburg 6-1 in the German Cup semifinal .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Sightseeing cruises to China's newest city, Sansha, located on a disputed island in the South China Sea, are set to commence this month, according to a Chinese official. The move is certain to add to the dispute over sovereignty claims to the area. Woody Island, known as Yongxing Island in Chinese, has a population of about a thousand, including military personnel. It's located 300 kilometers southeast of Hainan and was established as China's latest prefecture in June 2012. The city of Sansha has the smallest land area, but the largest sea area in China. Sansha's government has been set up to administer the Spratly Islands (Nansha Islands), the Macclesfield Bank (Zhongsha Islands) and the Paracel Islands (Xisha Islands), which include Woody Island. The islands are partly claimed by Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan. Shown in the map above are the islands. Closest to Sanya are the Paracel Islands. Further east is the Macclesfield Bank and south are the Spratlys. Sightseeing only . The cruise tour statement is a sign that China is bolstering its claim to the territory. Visitors won't be allowed to stay on the island. Instead, cruise-goers will eat and sleep onboard and only sightsee on the island, said Hainan deputy governor Tan Li at press conference at the annual Boao Forum for Asia over the weekend. ""We have started the planning and development of Sansha, including basic infrastructure, at full speed,"" Tan was quoted by state-run Xinhua News Agency (Chinese). ""Sansha's sightseeing routes, scenic spots and docking locations have been confirmed. We are hoping to begin [the cruise operation] before May 1."" Some 12 projects, including a berth for larger supply ship, freshwater supply, sewage and garbage treatment facilities are under development in Sansha. The first phrase of Yongxing Pier has been completed and begun trial operation. Sansha's first mayor, Xiao Jie, said last month the development and improvement of Sansha city will strengthen China's sovereignty of the islands. Xiao said that the priority would be conservation of the natural habitat, according to the state's travel network, The Travel Channel.","Sightseeing cruises flagged to start in April on disputed island .

"Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN) -- Imagine being a CEO of ideas, heading up a process in which you generate, process and test out new ideas -- for a living. Welcome to a day in the life of Pernille Aalund, CEO of Innovations at one of the biggest media houses in Scandinavia, Aller Media A/S. Her mandate is to generate 250 new ideas annually, out of which 50 have to settle into a new activity -- and income stream -- for the company. It sounds ambitious, because it is. ""It takes a real shift in a company's traditional way of thinking, to open itself to an innovations department. It has to move out of the usual way of working in silos, and be able to work all the way across."" Aalund is likely the right person for the job. She is not your usual business leader, and there is no doubt this 50-year-old high school graduate, is doing things her own way. ""I know where I am going, that's about it,"" says Aalund, who doesn't like to operate by rules, and runs her business by what she calls the cigar box principle. ""I am quite practical and simple in my approach. If I take out one krone, I know I need to put back two."" Don't let her simple approach fool you. Making it to the top of a media conglomerate takes something more, which she says comes in part from her wide background of experience. A single mother with virtually no education, Aalund worked as a record sorter, radio host, casting assistant, advertising representative, TV producer, and much more -- before founding her own production company, hosting her own TV show, launching her own magazine, and authoring several books. Read related: $800 million biotech business started in a garage . Her corporate career took off when Aller Media hired her as chief editor of one of their magazines. Separately, they bought some of her business ventures, including the web portal she founded for women. After a successful stint as chief editor, Aalund was asked to run about 20 of Aller's magazines, and last year they asked her to head up a new innovations department. ""I do have a very different approach to things,"" she says. ""I work differently than they do, and I question everything."" She has had to learn a few things along the way. Among other things, her male colleagues taught her how to leave her emotions behind, when entering a decision-making process. ""As women we have a tendency to make things personal. We are more holistic, which can be a great strength but it can also be very limiting. As a leader you have to be able to say, this will hurt, but we need to get it over with."" Aalund says she has never really taken on anything she knew how to do. But, that she always knew how to align herself with the best. ""When I started a new magazine and a TV show, I had no idea how to do it. But I knew how to find the best people to help me. For leaders today, it is not enough just to know how to be the CEO of a bank. You have to be able to do so much more. And that is not possible for any one person. So, I hire only the best. People who know more than I do."" Read related: Why women will impact global economy as much as China . That is what she has done in her ideas factory of sorts. They have more than a hundred ideas on the table since June, and she is confident they will hit their business and financial targets. Aalund says change is happening and so must we. ""Technology has outpaced tradition. Media habits are changing radically. So, we must think differently. And for us, it is really about putting old content into new bottles,"" she says. The process works with her team generating ideas from inside and out, filtering them, exploring their potential, refining them, creating a business case for them, and moving forward with worthwhile ventures for the company. It sounds like a creative process, but to Aalund, it is more than that. ""Innovation is defined as new ways of thinking that generate growth. It is the idea that gets put into action. Anyone can be creative, but creativity doesn't necessarily lead to growth,"" she says. Read related: CNN Money's 50 Most Powerful Women in Business . For Aller Media, whose products encompass everything from magazines to television, radio and web-based media, it means taking current competencies and strengths, and lifting them onto new platforms and into new times. ""As a 140 year old company, we do not need to be thinking out of the box. We need to be thinking at the edge of the box,"" she says. Perhaps not unlike herself, as she continues to move down new and innovative pathways. Alongside her job as head of innovations, this seemingly unstoppable entrepreneur has just launched a new online talk show, is writing books, and working on various TV shows.

"(CNN) -- The Florida police sergeant fired for possessing shooting targets resembling Trayvon Martin defended himself Sunday and said the targets were meant to be used as training aids for ""no-shoot"" situations. Sgt. Ron King was fired from his job as a firearms instructor for the Port Canaveral Police Department on Friday after an internal review determined he possessed the paper targets and offered them to fellow officers for use during a firearms training session earlier this month. ""When informed of the basic facts, (I) found the entire situation unacceptable,"" John Walsh, the interim chief executive of the Canaveral Port Authority, told reporters Saturday. ""It is not the type of behavior that I want a police officer to have on both a personal and professional level. I find his conduct intolerable and I demanded that the chief immediately start procedures to terminate this employee."" The paper targets show a faceless black hooded sweatshirt with a bull's-eye on the chest. In one hand is a can of iced tea and in the pocket is a pack of Skittles candy, the same items Martin was carrying when he was shot and killed last year in a case that has drawn national attention. King, in a video statement posted online, said he bought the targets because the two items -- the Skittles and iced tea -- were not threatening, which meant the target could be used to help train officers when not to shoot a suspect. King did not say where he bought the targets, but similar ones caused a controversy when they were first sold online a year ago. ""While others have used it as a novelty, I view it as a tool for scenario-based firearms training,"" King said. Using ""real-life situations"" as training scenarios is not uncommon for firearms instructors, he said, and they help teach police how to respond to incidents in the future. ""The only stupid act I performed was to believe that some of my coworkers would be mature enough and care enough to use a bad situation as a learning tool,"" King said, referring to the Martin case. Port Canaveral is just an hour away from Sanford, where the 17-year-old Martin was killed in February 2012 as he walked home at night from a convenience store. George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, is awaiting trial on a second-degree murder charge in Martin's death. He says he shot Martin in self-defense. King, who was hired in January 2011, disputed some of the details Walsh gave to reporters, including that he offered the targets to other officers to shoot. He said he showed them to only one, a fellow sergeant, to find out whether he thought they could be useful training aids. King said he offered one of the targets to the sergeant after the sergeant said his son would ""get a kick"" out of them. Instead of taking it, he said, the sergeant took a picture and then used the image to file a complaint about King. ""To the Martin family, I would like to apologize again for those law enforcement officials that chose to use your son's death as an element for their personal and political gains,"" King said. ""I assure you that the use of these targets that are in question is to prevent a tragedy from taking place."" On Saturday, Martin family attorney Ben Crump condemned the use of the targets as ""absolutely reprehensible."" ""Such a deliberate and depraved indifference to this grieving family is unacceptable,"" Crump said in a statement.","Sgt. Ron King was fired Friday from the Port Canaveral Police Department .

"(CNN) -- American Airlines grounded flights nationwide on Tuesday due to problems over several hours with its computerized reservation system. The decision also resulted its regional affiliate, American Eagle, holding flights at Dallas Ft. Worth, Chicago's O'Hare and New York LaGuardia -- all major airports for the carrier's domestic operations. The glitch caused big delays and flight cancellations for the company, which sought court approval on Monday to exit bankruptcy. It plans to merge with US Airways. American CEO Tom Horton apologized the customers in a video Tuesday evening, saying that the glitch was ""a software issue impacting both primary and backup systems."" Bad weather often forces airlines to halt flights in specific regions, but a nationwide grounding is highly unusual. American estimates it flies about 275,000 passengers a day and receives more than 239,000 reservations calls. American first reported computer problems via twitter at noon ET, then announced a ground stop one hour later. Its reservation systems were restored by 4:30 p.m., but the company said passengers could expect delays and cancellations throughout the day. The Federal Aviation Administration also confirmed that American had sought permission to hold flights. The carrier said in a statement that it saw ""no evidence"" that the technical outage was in any way related to Monday's deadly bombing in Boston that is under investigation as an act of terrorism. Airlines have long been a target of overseas terrorists, although U.S. officials say they have not determined whether the origin of the Boston attack was domestic or foreign. American's reservation systems are operated by the technology company Sabre, which told CNN that its systems were functioning, but American had trouble connecting. DFW, where American operates 85% of daily flights, used buses to help get passengers off planes because gates were full of aircraft that had not departed, spokesman David MagaÃ±a said. Inside the terminal there were some longer lines and the airport was more crowded than it would be on a day with normal operations. The carrier apologized to passengers and said they could rebook on another airline if they must travel on Tuesday and were already at the airport. American was also willing to honor fare differences for rebooked travel, in certain cases, or offer refunds in other circumstances. CNN's Devon Sayers and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","NEW: American CEO apologizes, says the glitch affected the backup system, too .

"Suwanee, Georgia (CNN) -- A gunman in apparent financial distress took several firefighters hostage Wednesday in suburban Atlanta, then was killed in an exchange of gunfire hours later after law enforcement authorities determined he might lash out at his captives. ""It got to the point where we believed that (the firefighters') lives were in immediate danger,"" Gwinnett County police spokesman Ed Ritter said Wednesday night. ""And our SWAT team made the decision to go in there and neutralize the situation."" All four Gwinnett County firefighters who were being held hostage suffered ""superficial"" injuries after authorities used explosives ""to distract the suspect to get in the house and take care of business,"" Ritter explained. Their injuries were the result of the explosions, not gunfire, and all four were expected to go home by night's end. One law enforcement officer was shot in the incident, but his injury is not considered life-threatening, according to Ritter. All those involved in the incident -- including the Gwinnett County police officer -- were in good condition as they were treated at Gwinnett Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Beth Okun said. Several have been released, she said. ""They are simply relieved that the situation is over,"" said Gwinnett County Fire Department spokesman Thomas Rutledge. ""The firefighters are glad to be getting treated ... and really work on getting their lives back to normal."" The hostage situation began around 3:40 p.m. Wednesday when the firefighters went to a residence in Suwanee ""for some type of medical call,"" Ritter said. Four hours later, he noted authorities still weren't sure whether that call was for a ""fake heart attack"" or the gunman was actually suffering from a medical condition. One fire engine and an ambulance were sent to the scene, as is customary, Rutledge said. He explained that the firefighters involved are cross-trained as paramedics so they can provide aid to county residents in purported medical emergencies like this, which happen ""hundreds of times throughout the year."" ""This is what they do, it's what they do very well,"" said Rutledge, saying the firefighters had no reason to think this situation would turn violent. ""This call seemed to be no different ... They were caught off guard."" Five firefighters had gone inside the home -- a two-story structure, one of many in the neighborhood about 30 miles northeast of Atlanta -- with a stretcher, then a single firefighter ran out about 30 minutes later, according to neighbors. Rutledge said one firefighter was let go so he could move the fire truck from in front of the house. The house was foreclosed upon in November and was being prepared for sale, said Brad German, a spokesman for Freddie Mac. It was not clear what, if anything, that fact had to do with what unfolded Wednesday. Jake Major, an 18-year-old neighbor who used to mow the alleged hostage taker's lawn, said he seemed ""really nice, ... like a normal guy."" His yard, though, ""was a mess (and) inside it was just as bad,"" Major said. Ritter, the police spokesman, said that the unidentified gunman started making demands related to the house after taking the firefighters hostage. ""The power was turned off along with the cable and cell phone and so on, and he wanted all those things turned back on,"" said Ritter, adding that ""apparently he was going through some financial issues."" Hostage negotiators were on site, as were agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to Richard Coes, a spokesman for that agency. As scores of law enforcement officers converged on the site, Major said his only hope was that everything he was hearing about the situation ""was wrong."" ""I knew that (once) it had escalated to this level, ... it wasn't going to end well,"" said Major, who lives about a block away. ""Whatever happened, it wasn't going to end well."" Explosions rang out around 7:30 p.m., and soon after ambulances rushed away from the scene. ""Thirty seconds later, I knew everything was OK,"" said Wesley Gossan, who lived two doors down, of the sequence of big and small explosions, followed by a flurry of gunfire. ""Because the (firefighters) walked out, they took their hard hats off."" Ritter explained later that there had been an exchange of ""gunfire between officers and that individual."" ""This was his call, his decision, this was the result of his actions,"" the police spokesman said. ""We didn't want it this way. But he was calling the shots.""

"New York (CNN) -- A rare copy of the first book printed in what is now the United States of America may sell for as much as $30 million when it comes up for auction in November, according to Sotheby's. Congregational Puritans first published the Bay Psalm Book in 1640 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Sotheby's presale estimate for one of 11 remaining copies ranges from $15 million to $30 million. The last time a Bay Psalm Book appeared at auction was in 1947. ""The Bay Psalm Book is a mythical rarity. Unseen on the marketplace for more than two generations, it has become too rare to collect,"" said David Redden of Sotheby's books department in a press release. ""Yet here it is today."" According to Sotheby's, the Puritans wanted a version of the Psalms that was a closer paraphrase of the Hebrew original than the one they brought from England. The copy to be auctioned on November 26 is one of two that come from the collection of Old South Church in Boston. Members of the church voted last December to put one copy up for auction in order to enhance finances and ministries. The book will be on display at Sotheby's in New York until Sunday. From there, it will travel around the country, making stops in Philadelphia, Chicago Dallas, and Los Angeles.","Copy of Bay Psalm Book is set for auction in November .

"(CNN) -- A chain-reaction crash involving 40 vehicles in Indiana injured 10 people who were sent to area hospitals Thursday, police said. One person died from injuries sustained in the wreck that closed a seven-mile section of Interstate 70 west of Indianapolis, Indiana State Police Capt. Dave Bursten said Friday. A hazardous materials team was cleaning up fuel and automobile lubricants from the roadway, Myers said. Wintry white-out conditions are one possible cause for the wreck, James said. A semi tractor and trailer hauling three elephants slid off the roadway at the crash scene, but the animals were not injured, authorities said. The elephants were never loose. In Michigan, three people were killed and up to 20 injured in another chain-reaction accident Thursday, state police said. Two children and one adult died, police said. The accident happened over the Rouge River Bridge in Detroit on Interstate 75, said Robert Morosi of the Michigan Department of Transportation. At least 30 cars were involved in the pileup, he said. Snow was falling at the time of the crash, Morosi said, describing conditions as a ""typical Michigan winter morning."" The jaws of life were used to pull people out of three vehicles, Shaw said. CNN's Michael Martinez, Stephanie Gallman and Jake Carpenter contributed to this report.","Trailer hauling elephants went off road, but they were not injured .

"Greenville, South Carolina (CNN) -- Some are girlish 22-year-olds; others are women approaching 40. They come from South Carolina's rural counties and its booming cities. They are loud and muted, lively and vacant, hopeful and desperate. As different as they are, they share a connection to two powerful forces : their addictions and their babies. They are swallowed by the same shameful past. They don't know if they can be good mothers. They don't know if they can be clean mothers. They're here at a state-run drug-treatment program to learn how to do both. On this summer day, Ashley Hendrix, 24, is eight months pregnant with her first child and one of 16 women at the Phoenix Center's Serenity Place. This is her last shot to get clean -- or face jail. South Carolina's state supreme court is alone in upholding the prosecution of pregnant women for the damage drugs might do to their unborn children. Across the country, local and state agencies have found ways to prosecute pregnant women for drug use, but the cases are often rejected by the courts. And judges in more than two dozen states have overturned decisions that criminalize pregnant addicts. In recent years, Missouri and North Dakota have ruled against charging pregnant women with neglect and endangerment. Illegal substances -- marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine and prescription drugs -- consumed Hendrix for more than a decade. ""To this day, I still cry about it, "" she said, ""that if anything does come out wrong with my baby, I know that my drug use is the reason why. Since 1989, at least 126 women in South Carolina have been arrested during their pregnancies, according to the National Advocates for Pregnant Women. Most were charged with drug and alcohol use that posed harm to the fetus the woman was carrying. During the same period, only about 80 pregnant women were arrested on similar charges in all other states combined. ""Word on the street"" in South Carolina, says Stephen Donaldson, program manager of a drug-treatment facility in Charleston County, ""is if you use during pregnancy, you're being prosecuted or you're losing your baby."" Over the last 15 years, that message has driven many women to Serenity Place, a residential treatment center designed for pregnant women and new mothers. Here, the ultimate goal is to help the women recover from their addiction but Serenity also strives to give the women the confidence to become better mothers. They want the women to know there are second chances, and there is hope. ""I'm grateful everyday for being here and I'm grateful to have my baby with me,"" says a freckled Kim Clark, 28, who gave birth to her son Jaelyn at the center. ""I've been using drugs since I was 11 years old. I didn't know any other life. And I've learned a lot about myself. I've been taught things here."" She graduated in August, has her own apartment now and works to support herself and her son. Some women arrive here voluntarily. Others were sent by the state's Department of Social Services. Others made a plea bargain with the courts, allowing them one last chance at treatment to avoid prison. ""My biggest fear was the [health of the] baby, but right behind that was that 'I'm going to go to jail',"" says Sandria Doremus, one of Hendrix' classmates at Serenity. Afraid of being turned in for her opiate addiction, she delayed getting prenatal care. ""I should have gone in a lot sooner,"" she admits. Doremus, 37, arrived at Serenity after a hospital reported her drug use to law enforcement officials, as required by law. She has sandy blond hair and warm blue eyes that open up her leathered face. She cuddled her 8-month-old son, Matthew, when CNN visited the center in July. Born with heroin in his system, Matthew was placed on methadone. Today, he is healthy, but studies show drug-exposed babies can face developmental delays and learning disabilities in later years. Watch the women of Serenity Place share their story » . In 1997, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that a fetus in the third trimester was viable and charges of child abuse, neglect and murder could apply to the mother. Some treatment providers and advocacy experts say this ruling opened the door for prosecutors to charge pregnant women. ""These are addicts who become pregnant,"" says Lynn Paltrow, executive director of the National Advocates for Pregnant Women. ""They aren't women who chose to use drugs after becoming pregnant."" 'If I didn't have pills, I felt like I had nothing' Hendrix's drug addiction started long before her pregnancy. She was born into a world of drugs. She says her mother was an addict, her father a violent alcoholic who once held a shotgun to her grandmother's head. Hendrix's grandparents rescued her at age 3 by taking her into their home in rural Union, South Carolina. She has fond memories of her grandfather, but one morning, shortly after her 12th birthday, Hendrix watched her 54-year-old grandfather die from a heart attack. The innocent girl started experimenting with drugs, partly because she couldn't cope with her feelings, she says, but mostly to fit in. By the time she turned 18, marijuana use gave way to cocaine and methamphetamine. Then she discovered prescription painkillers: Lortab. OxyContin. Percocet. ""It wasn't even about being high anymore. It was just being able to cope with everyday life,"" Hendrix says. ""If I didn't have the pills, I felt like I had nothing."" Hendrix could no longer leave bed without the painkillers. Her routine consisted of melting OxyContin pills with water, placing the mixture into a syringe and shooting up, even during her pregnancy. By April of this year, she was six months pregnant and on probation for stealing jewelry to feed her drug habit. She took herself to Serenity Place. Tucked alongside empty factories in a once-thriving textile district, the center looks more like a college dormitory inside than a sterile treatment center. Homemade posters, photo collages and cards congratulating the women for giving birth are strewn along the hallways. There is a communal kitchen and colorful playgrounds. Research shows women who remain with their children during treatment have better chances of defeating their addictions. But a national study in 2005 found that only 3 percent of treatment centers had programs tailored specifically to pregnant women. About 14 percent of treatment centers accepted pregnant or postpartum women. The women at Serenity Place follow a rigid schedule that includes therapy, parenting classes and chores. They aren't allowed phone calls or the freedom to surf the Internet without permission. Security cameras guard all exits. The structure can be particularly hard for addicts who grew up in dysfunctional households with few rules. Women spend on average six months in treatment. If a woman violates the rules, she can be removed from the program. On some occasions, women have walked out of the center, leaving their newborns behind. Why prosecute? Why should addicted women be given a chance at motherhood? What about the welfare of the children? These are the questions asked by South Carolina prosecutors, known as solicitors general. Several solicitors general contacted by CNN declined to comment on how many such cases they have prosecuted, but they say that charging pregnant women has become less common in the state. Bob Ariail, solicitor of Greenville, says his district's policy is a far cry from the 1990s, when then-South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon, an anti-abortion advocate, publicly declared he would aggressively crack down on pregnant mothers accused of substance abuse. Condon often referred to a fetus as his ""fellow South Carolinian."" Despite several phone calls by CNN, Condon, who is now a private lawyer in South Carolina, could not be reached for comment. In his two decades as a Democratic state representative, Joe Neal of Columbia, South Carolina, has pushed for more drug treatment funding, an effort he says has little chance in these tough economic times. ""Drug treatment?"" says Neal. ""South Carolina's response to addiction has been incarceration not treatment."" But Wanda McMichael, manager of women's services at Serenity Place, knows treatment can be beneficial. She guides women like Hendrix and the others through that process. Some who graduated from the program when it began in 1993 still remain clean. ""What's the other alternative if they don't come here?"" says McMichael. ""It's prison. That costs more than treatment, but a lot of people don't know that. If these women don't get this treatment, they are going to die."" A healthy baby, a new hope . Most of the women at Serenity Place say they were little girls the first time they used drugs, some as young as 8. Many could not recall what sobriety felt like until they came to the center. Hendrix says her own mother was 15 when she gave birth to her and then abandoned her. ""She was real pretty. Blond hair, pale skin like me,"" Hendrix says. ""I have her nose and lips. She just didn't respect herself."" Hendrix doesn't want to be like her mother. Her son, who was born July 24, is healthy. In August, Hendrix left Serenity for an intensive outpatient treatment program, and she and her baby live with her grandmother in Union. Of the 16 women enrolled in Serenity in July, half have graduated, program directors say. Six continue receiving treatment and two have left the center. Three women are on a waiting list to get in, including one who is pregnant. Hendrix hopes to get her GED and enroll in the University of South Carolina to study psychology next year. ""I am happy today,"" she says, ""and that's something I haven't felt in a long time. ""My grandmother. My baby. They make me happy. But you know, it's not about them, jail or none of that anymore. That all changed. I am doing this for me.""","Serenity Place in South Carolina caters treatment programs to pregnant addicts .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- China's economy grew by 8.7 percent in 2009, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. China's fourth quarter growth alone surged to 10.7 percent on an annualized basis. China's economy has been picking up pace the first three quarters of the year, growing at 6.2 percent the first quarter and 7.9 percent the second quarter and 9.1 percent in the third quarter. The gross domestic product total was $4.9 trillion in 2009. The annual growth was spurred by a $586 billion stimulus package to bolster its economy. The government had set a growth target rate of 8 percent last year, which the government sees as a benchmark to maintain employment rates in the nation of 1.3 billion. ""In the face of severe impact brought about by the global financial crisis in a century and the most complicated domestic and international situations, the (government) sized up the situation, made scientific decisions, and headed the whole nation united as one to surmount the difficulties of our time,"" said Ma Jiantang, director of the National Bureau of Statistics. ""It stopped the remarkable decline ... and China became the first to emerge (from the recession)."" Retail sales rose 16.9 percent in 2009, as China encourage domestic spending to make up for lost export business during the recession. But concerns are rising of a growing property bubble in China, fueled by lending which has seen property prices grow 50 percent or more in some cities. On Wednesday China signaled to several banks to curb lending, causing stock markets to slump globally as questions about China's lending practices slammed the price of commodities. The sector was also hit by reports that China intends to slow the pace of lending this year in an attempt to get ahead of inflation. A stronger dollar also pressured dollar-traded commodity prices and stocks. ""China's efforts to get their banks to lend less really hit commodities hard, because China is the marginal buyer of commodities,"" said David Chalupnik, head of equities at First American Funds. The numbers released Thursday showed, foreign trade dropped 13.9 percent. China still holds a significant trade surplus -- $196 billion -- though the surplus slipped more than 34 percent. Monthly import-export numbers for December 2009, however, were up.","China's economy grew by 8.7 percent in 2009, according to the National Bureau of Statistics .

"(EW.com) -- Today, Major League Baseball will celebrate its annual Jackie Robinson Day, and all players and umpires will wear jerseys with the number 42, which Robinson, the first African-American player in the MLB, made famous. Don't be surprised if the execs at Warner Bros. join in on the fun. The studio did have a grand slam weekend, after all. Warner Bros.' new baseball drama 42 topped the box office with $27.3 million — far ahead of recent baseball titles like Moneyball ($19.5 million debut) and Trouble with the Curve ($12.2 million). In fact, 42 scored the best ever debut for a baseball film, surpassing The Benchwarmers' $19.7 million bow. 42 also became the latest release to earn a rare ""A+"" CinemaScore grade, signifying exemplary word-of-mouth among ticket-buyers. Former ""A+"" releases include The Help, Tangled, The Blind Side, Titanic, and A Few Good Men. 42, which was produced by Legendary Pictures for $40 million, stars newcomer Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson, as well as Harrison Ford as MLB exec Branch Rickey. The film played exceedingly well with older moviegoers (59 percent of audience members were above the age of 35) and African-American crowds (all ten of 42′s top theaters were in urban markets). According to Warner Bros., a surprisingly high 52 percent of the opening weekend crowd was female. If history is any indication, 42 will keep running around the bases for a long time to come. Like fellow ""A+"" films The Help and The Blind Side, which also deal with racial issues, 42 should earn a terrific multiplier and finish well above $100 million. Warner Bros. says it plans on expanding the film from its already-wide 3,002 theater count next weekend. EW: '42' movie review . In second place, Scary Movie 5 hit more of a bunt than a home run during its opening frame. The spoof sequel nabbed an unremarkable $15.2 million over the Friday-to-Sunday period from 3,402 theaters, a low-point for the 13-year-old franchise. Part of the reason for Scary Movie 5's sub-par performance may have to do with the fact that it arrived in theaters a full seven years after Scary Movie 4, which earned $40.2 million in its opening weekend in 2006. That's quite a long break for a youth-targeting franchise like Scary Movie. The film stars High School Musical's Ashley Tisdale, as well as tabloid-magnets Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen in supporting roles. (Hey, at least this did better than Lohan's last starring effort!) Those casting stunts weren't enough to drum up interest in the wretchedly-reviewed sequel, though. Scary Movie 5, which Weinstein/Dimension spent $20 million to produce, drew less interest than similar horror spoof A Haunted House, which scared up an $18.1 million opening in January — against a $1.5 million budget no less! Audiences issued Scary Movie 5 a ""C-"" CinemaScore grade. Fox's hit animated family film The Croods dropped by a slightly larger-than-expected 36 percent in its fourth weekend to $13.2 million. The $135 million caveman comedy has now earned $142.5 million domestically, and may finish its run with about $180 million. Overseas, The Croods has earned an additional $207 million, making it a big winner for Fox Animation. EW: 'Scary Movie 5' review . G.I. Joe: Retaliation dipped 48 percent to $10.8 million this weekend, bringing its total to $102.4 million after three weekends. While the film is running behind its predecessor domestically and won't match G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra's $150.2 million total, it's making up ground overseas, where it has earned $168.3 million — ahead of Cobra's $152.3 million international finish. Paramount, MGM, and Skydance spent $130 million on the sequel. Rounding out the Top 5 was last weekend's champ, Evil Dead, which plummeted 63 percent to $9.5 million. Due to Evil Dead's built-in cult audience, much of which came to the theater on opening day, a large drop was expected. After ten days, the $17 million production from Sony's TriStar, Film District, and Ghost House Productions, has earned $41.5 million and may finish with about $55 million overall. 1. 42 -- $27.3 million . 2. Scary Movie 5 -- $15.2 million . 3. The Croods -- $13.2 million . 4. G.I. Joe: Retaliation -- $10.8 million . 5. Evil Dead -- $9.5 million . In limited release, the Ryan Gosling/Bradley Cooper drama The Place Beyond the Pines successfully expanded into 514 theaters, where it grossed $4.1 million, good for a strong $7,937 location average. Danny Boyle's latest, Trance, wasn't as fortunate. The film moved from four to 438 theaters this weekend, but could only manage a $925,000 frame, yielding a weak $2,112 average. Expect the former film to continue its expansion, while the latter may have trouble convincing tehater owners to take it on board. Internationally, the Tom Cruise thriller Oblivion had a terrific debut with $61.1 million from 52 territories, 48 of which it won. Oblivion's strongest markets included Russia ($8.6 million), the U.K. and Ireland ($7.9 million), and France ($3.9 million). The Universal sci-fi adventure opened in the same range as Oz The Great and Powerful, which conjured a $69.9 million international bow and has now grossed $251.6 million overseas.

"(CNN) -- Israeli settlements have taken a ""heavy toll"" on the rights and sovereignty of Palestinians, a U.N. report said Thursday. The U.N. Human Rights Council report ticked off a range of rights it says have been consistently violated in the West Bank and East Jerusalem during what it calls ""creeping annexation"" by Israel. Yair Lapid: Israel's man of the 'future' They include ""self-determination, non-discrimination, freedom of movement, equality, due process, fair trial, not to be arbitrarily detained, liberty and security of person, freedom of expression, freedom to access places of worship, education, water, housing, adequate standard of living, property, access to natural resources."" ""The settlements are established for the exclusive benefit of Israeli Jews; settlements are being maintained and developed through a system of total segregation between the settlers and the rest of the population,"" the report said. ""This system of segregation is supported and facilitated by a strict military and law enforcement control to the detriment of the rights of the Palestinian population."" Israel defies international criticism of settlement plans . Palestinians welcomed the report, which calls for the settlement activity to stop and settlers to depart. Israel, which has long considered the Human Rights Council as ""systematically one-sided and biased"" toward the Jewish state, said the report will hurt peace efforts. Israel did not cooperate with the U.N. three-person mission, whose members are from France, Pakistan and Botswana. The U.N. report was issued after Israel did not show up at a U.N. review of its human rights record. ""The only way to resolve all pending issues between Israel and the Palestinians, including the settlements issue, is through direct negotiations without preconditions,"" said Yigal Palmor, Israel's Foreign Ministry spokesman. ""Counterproductive measures, such as the report before us, will only hamper efforts to find a sustainable solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict."" Read more: Israel says it will build settlements in East Jerusalem . There are about 250 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the report said, all started since Israel seized the lands after the Six Day War in 1967. There are about 320,000 people in the West Bank and 200,000 in East Jerusalem. After the war, Israel soon annexed East Jerusalem. It established a unified Jerusalem as its capital and has established settlements in the West Bank, the Palestinian land, over the decades, but has not annexed any of that territory. The country has cited the need for a presence in the West Bank for security, but Jewish settlers -- some for religious reasons and others seeking affordable dwellings -- have made their homes in the land. That consistently growing presence in East Jerusalem and the West Bank has caused great tension between Israel and the Arab world, including the Palestinians. Q&A: Inside Israel's planned settlement . The inability of Israel and the Palestinians to reach a political agreement over the West Bank and Jerusalem has arguably been one of the major obstacles to peace in the region. The report cited evidence of ""dispossession, evictions, demolitions and displacement,"" particularly widespread in East Jerusalem. It cited the existence of Jewish settler violence. It said that harassment of Palestinians is ""institutionalized"" and that women alone in their homes, Bedouins and other ""vulnerable groups are easy targets for settler violence."" ""The identities of settlers who are responsible for violence and intimidation are known to the Israeli authorities, yet these acts continue with impunity,"" the report said. ""The motivation behind this violence and the intimidation against the Palestinians as well as their properties is to drive the local populations away from their lands and allow the settlements to expand."" The fact-finding mission singled out a ""high number of children"" seized by authorities ""for minor offenses."" ""They are invariably mistreated, denied due process and fair trial,"" the report said. In violation of international law, they are ""transferred to detention centers in Israel."" Clinton: New Israeli settlements a 'setback' for peace . It also said that Israel is failing to protect their right of access to education. ""Children suffer harassment, violence and encounter significant obstacles in attending educational institutions, which limits their right to access education,"" the report said. It also said Israel must comply with the Fourth Geneva Convention, which states that occupying powers shouldn't transfer parts of its civilian population into territory it occupies. It calls for stopping all settlement activity and says Israel ""must immediately initiate a process of withdrawal of all settlers."" Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, called the report ""courageous."" She hails it for labeling all settlement activities as illegal and noting that serious settler violence is leading to ""ethnic cleansing."" ""Instead of boycotting the Human Rights Council, Israel should act in compliance with this report. Otherwise, it will continue to isolate itself outside the law and it will continue to delegitimize its behavior in all aspects of the occupation,"" she said.","Israel says it thinks the Human Rights Council is biased .

"HIAWATHA, Iowa (CNN) -- As Dr. Jennifer Lickteig examines patients at the Linn Community Care Health Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, she's also earning money from a second career that has nothing to do with medicine. Dr. Jennifer Lickteig started her online clothing business while taking time off from medicine to raise her family. Lickteig runs a clothing store on eBay, where she's a ""Gold PowerSeller,"" ranking among the top 1½ percent of merchants on the online marketplace. The 35-year-old family practitioner says she earned $120,000 last year on eBay, more than she did practicing medicine. ""It's just kind of this thrill,"" she said. ""It think it's the thrill of having built up this business and just done it myself. I don't have to get an MBA. I don't have to have a storefront."" As health care reform threatens to shake up the business of medicine, recruiting firms promote alternatives for doctors at pharmaceutical, biotechnology, insurance and investment banking firms. But eBay? Lickteig was juggling medicine with mothering her two boys when she became pregnant with twin girls. Once Natalie and Melanie arrived, Lickteig had to take time out from her practice. Between feeding and changing her genetically identical daughters, Lickteig was online, discovering that she had the genes of a businesswoman -- a trait that had been hiding behind her medical degree. Pursuing alternatives beyond medicine is a growing trend among doctors, according to Robert Priddy, president of Third Evolution, which helps physicians find careers outside traditional medical practice. ""I tell doctors they can pretty much do whatever they want,"" Priddy said. ""They're enormously driven, intelligent and fast learners."" Lickteig orders merchandise from apparel wholesalers and uses much of her home as a warehouse. The floor of an entire bedroom is covered with inventory, and boxes are piled in her garage. While at home with the girls, Lickteig regularly checks her laptop to mind the store and answer questions from consumers. She packs and labels shipments at night once the kids are asleep. The twins are now 3, and her sons, Tim, 9, and Matt, 7, are in school, allowing Lickteig to practice medicine part time. But she won't give up eBay, though she admits that a doctor selling clothing online seems unusual, even crazy. ""It sort of is. But it's a business, a successful business,"" she said. Her husband, Larry, has a good job as an actuary, so it's not as if she needs a second career. But even as a doctor, she feels, it's a good idea to have a Plan B. ""I think it's really important. You look at the recession and people losing their job; if you have something to fall back on, it's your insurance,"" she said. Medicine still has its rewards for Lickteig. But like many doctors, she's frustrated that insurance companies and malpractice lawyers have so much influence on the practice of medicine. ""If you had looked into a crystal ball and someone told you that you were going to have four children someday, and given all the hassles of medicine, would you have done it? Then I would have said, 'Heck, no,' "" she admitted. Even so, super-mom Jennifer Lickteig is trying to do it all: juggling two sons, twin girls and twin careers, the ultimate balancing act for a doctor who believes in having a little money-making fun on the side.","Iowa doctor started second career selling clothes on eBay while home with twins .

"(CNN) -- To most of the world, David Beckham is a soccer player, both hero and goat, at times loved and loathed, depending on which end of his gracefully served free kicks you reside. The hullabaloo over Beckham's arrival on American shores in 2007, however, had little to do with the Beautiful Game. There is no shortage of Americans who see nothing attractive in the sport at all. They don't get it or don't want to. Yet Beckham somehow mattered, if his vocation didn't. With the 38-year-old announcing his retirement Thursday, it's difficult to quantify his ultimate impact on the game in the United States, but it's safe to say he didn't hurt it. A rocky start to the U.S. leg of his colorful career may have dampened the fanfare with which he landed in Los Angeles to play for Major League Soccer's Galaxy, but he'd eventually snare two MLS Cups before returning to Europe to ply his trade. ""He was still a bit more successful as a celebrity than as a soccer player, which makes sense, because we're more of a celebrity culture than a soccer culture,"" said Sports illustrated senior writer and Fox Soccer analyst Grant Wahl. Wahl, also author of ""The Beckham Experiment: How the World's Most Famous Athlete Tried to Conquer America,"" said the England international's move from Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid to L.A. was met with an immediate spike in interest among Americans. Becks put butts in seats, and opposing teams would develop marketing plans around him to sell tickets when the Galaxy visited, Wahl said. The results on the field, however, left Galaxy fans wanting, as his first four years were defined by injury, sparse appearances and contentious loan spells to Italy's AC Milan. Bleacher Report: Beckham's career-defining moments . Still, Beckham's mere presence was enough to increase the attention Americans paid to soccer, which has long been a fifth wheel or worse among many American sports fans. ""it's very hard to specifically quantify"" what Beckham has meant to the U.S. game's growth, said Sunil Gulati, president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, but several milestones followed his arrival: MLS attendance is up, there are more live games -- MLS and otherwise -- on television, the L.A. Galaxy has become a global brand, and most important, a sport that commanded only a few column inches of coverage 20 years ago now enjoys widespread coverage by the nation's sports media. ""David helped in that. He's certainly given the sport a lot of exposure,"" Gulati said. ""He increased the visibility of the sport and growth of the game, which was already on a good path."" Consider, too, these facts: . • In 2006, a year before the Coming of Beckham, MLS signed an eight-year deal with ESPN, which brought the league between $7 million and $8 million annually, according to Sports Business Daily. A deal with NBC for the 2012-14 seasons reportedly earned the league $10 million a year. • About 3 million people attended MLS games in 2006, with an average attendance of about 15,500 per game. Last year, with more teams, the total attendance doubled while the average attendance jumped more than 3,000 per game. • Chivas USA and Real Salt Lake both paid $10 million expansion fees to join the MLS in 2005, while Toronto FC paid the same amount in 2007. The Montreal Impact, which began playing during the 2012 season, paid $40 million. There are reports that Abu Dhabi's Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan would be willing to pay $100 million for his prospective New York City FC to join the MLS. • There were only 12 teams in the MLS the year before Beckham arrived. Montreal became the 19th team last year. • The year Beckham joined the Galaxy, barely 100 players were making $100,000 or more (PDF), and only four -- one of them Beckham -- had a salary of more than $1 million, according to the MLS Players Union. This year, 240 players made at least six figures (PDF), and eight players draw paychecks of $1 million or more. Blame it on Beckham? Perhaps not. It's a stretch to anoint him ""savior of the MLS,"" Wahl said. The league hasn't collapsed since he left for Paris Saint-Germain. Plus, the MLS did a lot to promote the sport on its own -- building soccer-specific stadiums, expanding into the right cities, developing youth players -- while ESPN helped lay the groundwork with its coverage of World Cups. But, Wahl concedes, ""I do think Beckham is a part of it. ""I look at what he achieved here. It wasn't all that different than what Pele did when he came in the 1970s to play for the New York Cosmos,"" he said, referring to the North American Soccer League, which folded in 1984. As the best player of all time, Pele put a spotlight on the game that perhaps no other player could. And while Beckham, wielder of a deft right foot in his own right, won't be mentioned among history's greatest ever, Wahl said he believes Beckham was the biggest celebrity to play the game. You look at the world's greatest athletes -- Tiger Woods, Usain Bolt, Lionel Messi, LeBron James -- and none carries the cachet that comes with Beckham, Wahl said. Beckham wasn't even the best player to grace MLS, he said. The New York Red Bulls' Thierry Henry, a French goal machine who holds every major title for which he's competed, including the World Cup that eluded Beckham, holds that honor. But he's no Beckham, either, Wahl said. So what is it about Becks that makes him so appealing? Gulati said he believes it's that combination of unique player and grand persona that makes Beckham Beckham. ""There's only one player in the last 20 years that is iconic in the way that David Beckham is,"" he said. Wahl sees it similarly. Beckham is ""a pro's pro,"" a guy known for his work ethic, a free kick master who captained England for six years and won league championships in England, Spain, the United States and France. He has a relatively quiet demeanor and lets his action speak more than his words, Wahl said, and it doesn't hurt that he's married to a Spice Girl and is the object of much adoration.

"(CNN) -- Juventus rebounded from last week's Champions League quarterfinal exit by winning 2-0 at Lazio to extend their lead at the top of Serie A to eleven points. The defending champions ensured they profited from second-placed Napoli's 1-1 draw at Milan on Sunday to strengthen their grip on the championship with just six games remaining. Arturo Vidal, who missed Wednesday's 2-0 home defeat by Bayern Munich (which gave the Germans a 4-0 aggregate win), was the Juventus hero as he scored his first league goals since November. The Chilean opened the scoring after eight minutes from the penalty spot, after striker Mirko Vucinic was brought down in the area by Lazio's Lorik Cana. Twenty minutes later, Vidal doubled the away side's lead as he rifled home following good approach play by midfielder Claudio Marchisio. ""It was a strange kind of week, we had to get over a deserved Champions League exit, something that surprised us for the domineering way in which it came,"" captain Gianluigi Buffon told reporters after the match. ""If we're able to reach our target of the Scudetto, be it in three or four weeks time, it would represent a great achievement. ""It would give us a sense of continuity from last year and I think it would be a deserved victory. We have been out in front from the start and managed to overcome some difficult moments during the season."" Lazio fans appreciated the opportunity to watch their favorites in action again, after the club was forced to play last week's Europa League clash against Fenerbahce behind closed doors as punishment by UEFA for repeated racist chanting from the club's supporters. Goalkeeper Buffon was grateful for the fans' presence, going over to applaud the Lazio faithful at the final whistle. ""We're not used to these things in Italy, but Lazio fans have always shown me respect over the years and I make a point of going over to applaud them whenever I'm here. I hold them in high regard and they deserve it."" Monday's victory takes Juventus to 74 points, with Napoli in second on 63 -- and Milan in third on 59 points. Lazio's European hopes suffered yet another blow as their seventh defeat in their last 11 Serie A games ensured they stayed fifth in the table, level on points with city rivals Roma. Elsewhere in Europe on Monday, Real Mallorca beat fellow relegation strugglers Celta Vigo 1-0 after Giovani dos Santos grabbed a goal three minutes into stoppage time. The win lifted Real Mallorca off the bottom of the Spanish table, leapfrogging their opponents as they did so.","Juventus win 2-0 at Lazio to extend Serie A lead to 11 points .

"RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (CNN) -- Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination was her own fault, the country's president, Pervez Musharraf, said in an interview that aired Sunday on U.S. television. Bhutto sits on stage at a campaign rally minutes before her assassination. ""For standing up outside the car, I think it was she to blame alone -- nobody else. Responsibility is hers,"" the former general told CBS' ""60 Minutes."" Bhutto was killed December 27 in Rawalpindi, south of the Pakistani capital Islamabad, while she was standing in an armored moving car after rallying supporters for now-postponed parliamentary elections. Her head was above the roof and unprotected at the time of the attack. The cause of her death is not clear: a bomber blew himself up near Bhutto's limousine and videotape showed a gunman present, though no autopsy has been carried out. Asked if Bhutto could have been shot, Musharraf said, ""Yes, absolutely, yes. Possibility."" He has said he welcomes an international investigation. Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999, rejected criticism that his government did not do enough to provide security to Bhutto, who was seeking to regain the post of prime minister. He noted that she had already survived one assassination attempt and ""was given more security than any other person."" Asked about the hunt for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, widely rumored to be in the remote border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan, Musharraf said, ""There is no proof whatsoever that he's here. We are not particularly looking for him, but we are operating against this -- and al Qaeda and militant Taliban. And in the process, obviously, it is combined. Maybe we are looking for him also."" And Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Mahmud Ali Durrani, told CNN's ""Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer"" that, ""If we knew where he was, we would have taken him out."" Durrani added that Musharraf's comment about ""not specifically looking for Osama"" means that the Pakistani military is ""totally focused on destroying al Qaeda and the Taliban network and not just one person."" About Bhutto's death, he noted only that the investigation is not completed ""and we should not jump to conclusions."" Still, he added, ""if she had not come out of the vehicle, the protected and armored vehicle, maybe we would have seen her smiling face again today."" Though Musharraf's popularity at home has plummeted, he retains support from GOP presidential contender Sen. John McCain. ""I think he's a good man,"" the Arizonan told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""But I think he's made mistakes, don't get me wrong. And we've got to move forward with these elections and have them free and fair. ""But I can work with him. He understands the threat to his country that the Taliban and al Qaeda present. And radical Islamic extremists. He's a very smart man. He'd be one of the first to go. They've tried to kill him nine times, OK? Nine times they've tried to kill Musharraf. He's not their favorite guy."" The New York Times reported Sunday that the Bush administration is considering expanding covert operations in the western part of Pakistan to shore up support for Musharraf's government and to find bin Laden and his second in command, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Democratic presidential candidate Bill Richardson of New Mexico told CNN's ""Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer"" that, though he had not heard details of the plan, ""it sounds like a strategy that makes sense."" He added, ""We have got to take whatever action is needed."" Richardson has called for Musharraf to step down and has called for free and fair elections. ""What we need to do is ask Musharraf, push him, push him to step aside for the good of the country, because he is widely unpopular,"" he told CNN. Sen. Hillary Clinton, a Democratic presidential candidate from New York, said Saturday that she would try to persuade Musharraf to share the responsibility for safeguarding his country's nuclear weapons with a delegation from the United States and perhaps Great Britain. Meanwhile, detectives from Britain's Scotland Yard Saturday examined the scene where Bhutto was assassinated. CNN cameraman Phil Littleton said the British counter-terrorism officers spent more than two hours at the public park at Liaqat Bath in Rawalpindi. They also visited the site where Bhutto held a rally just prior to her killing. The team of five detectives arrived in Pakistan Friday after Musharraf agreed they should work alongside Pakistani agencies to determine how Bhutto was killed and who was responsible for her death. The Pakistan interior ministry say the former leader died when she hit her head on the lever of her car's sunroof after ducking for cover after a suicide bomb attack on her convoy. However, supporters of Bhutto insist she was shot prior to the explosion -- a view that some say is supported by video footage of the moments before the blast. In Rawalpindi, police commandos blocked off the road while the British investigators were walked around the scene by Pakistani police, Littleton said. He said the detectives took photographs and climbed onto a building that overlooked the site of the rally and assassination. The investigators also spoke with members of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) at a makeshift shrine positioned on the side of the road where the killing took place, he added. They departed the scene under heavy police escort. Asif Ali Zardari, who has stepped in to lead the PPP, has called for a United Nations inquiry into his late wife's assassination. Musharraf said Wednesday that he expected the Scotland Yard investigators to help ""solve all the confusion"" surrounding the case.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Perhaps he should be called Captain Phoenix? Captain America will return in a new comic book series July 1. Its title: ""Captain America Reborn."" Rising from the dead after being killed off over two years ago, Captain America is being resurrected by Marvel Comics. Though the circumstances of his return are being closely shielded, the star-spangled superhero returns July 1 in a five-comic-book series, ""Captain America Reborn."" A big-budget movie in development by Marvel is also expected in 2011. After close to 60 years in print, Marvel Comics killed off Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, in 2007, one of its most famous and beloved superheroes, amid a controversial story line. He fought and triumphed over Hitler, Tojo, international Communism and a host of super-villains, but a sniper's bullet cut Captain America down in 2007, a move that shocked many of his fans. ""The reaction was amazing,"" says Marvel Executive Editor Tom Brevoort. ""It certainly was like the world went crazy for three days. Everybody had a point of view about it, including fans who hadn't read the comic for 30 years."" In the comic series, Rogers was to stand trial for defying a superhero registration law passed after a hero's tragic mistake causes a 9/11-like event. Marvel said the comic story line was intentionally written as an allegory to current real-life issues like the Patriot Act, the war on terror and September 11. Rogers eventually surrenders to police. He is later mortally wounded as he climbs the courthouse steps. It was a violent and strange end for an American hero and icon. The primary shooter, Crossbones -- working under the orders of Captain America's longtime nemesis, the Red Skull -- was caught. The identity of a second shooter is revealed in issue 600, which goes on sale Monday. Many felt Captain America's death in 2007 was symbolic of the time. And his return now? ""The tenor of the world now is when we're at a point where we want to believe in heroes. Someone who can lead the way,"" said Brevoort. ""It just feels like the right time."" Captain America first appeared in 1941, just as the United States entered World War II. He was a symbol of American strength and resolve in fighting the Axis powers. As originally conceived by creators Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, Rogers was born before the Great Depression in a very different America. He disappeared after the war and only reappeared recently in the Marvel timeline. Keeping superheroes dead and buried does not come easy. Even Superman, who was killed off by DC Comics in 1993, came back to life a year later. And what of Captain America's sidekick, Bucky Barnes? After taking up the shield and mission of Captain America for the past year, it'll be time to relinquish the mantle. Is there room for two sentinels of liberty? Stay tuned.

"(CNN) -- Six hundred passengers were evacuated from a high-speed train in Taiwan on Friday after explosives -- attached to a timer and apparently close to detonation -- were found in luggage inside a restroom, police said. The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. train stopped at Hsinchu City after someone found the explosives in two pieces of luggage shortly after 9 a.m., according to police. Police said the luggage was emitting white smoke, and people nearby could smell gas. The setup included 5 liters of gasoline and an activated timer device to trigger them, police said. Investigators believe the explosives would have detonated had authorities not intervened, according to police. They said they believe the blast would have taken out one carriage. A carriage can carry about 60 passengers. Police did not release any information about who could be responsible for the device. The train started at Zuoying and was headed to Taipei. CNN's Karen Smith and Jason Hanna contributed to this report .","Investigators: The bomb could have taken out one carriage, carrying up to 60 people .

"Washington (CNN) -- Pakistani intelligence secretly funneled at least $4 million to a Washington front group whose leaders improperly lobbied U.S. officials over the disputed territory of Kashmir, federal agents alleged Tuesday. A Pakistani-American man who served as director of the Kashmiri American Council is in federal custody, while a second man accused of steering money to the organization is believed to be in Pakistan, the Justice Department said. The KAC director, Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai, ""acted at the direction and with the financial support of the government of Pakistan for more than 20 years,"" an FBI arrest affidavit states. One U.S. congressman quickly gave $4,000 donated by the two men charged in the case to charity, while another said he would consider a similar move if the source of the money was in question. Fai and his co-defendant, Zaheer Ahmad, have been charged with conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires lobbyists acting on behalf of another nation to register with the U.S. government. The charge carries a possible prison term of up to five years. Short, balding and bespectacled, Fai made a brief initial appearance in federal court in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia, Tuesday afternoon. He wore a short-sleeved, checked shirt and dark slacks at the hearing, during which no plea was entered. U.S. Magistrate Judge Theresa Buchanan urged Fai to get a local attorney to defend him after the defendant told her his lawyer was in Rochester, New York. Buchanan set a detention and preliminary hearing for Thursday at afternoon. The goal of the operation was to tilt U.S. policy in Pakistan's favor on Kashmir, a Himalayan territory disputed between India and Pakistan since Pakistan's independence from Britain in 1947. Both nations claim the entire region, which has been divided between them by a U.N.-monitored cease-fire line. The dispute has been the flashpoint in two wars between the nuclear-armed south Asian rivals. Fai was operating as a Pakistani agent as early as 1995, the FBI affidavit states. His group organized seminars, lectures and conferences on Kashmir, and Fai attended a dinner with members of Congress in 2008, according to the affidavit. Another longtime FBI source said up to 80 percent of Fai's public statements are provided by Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency ""to repeat and disseminate verbatim,"" the document states. ""The other 20 percent of the KAC's messaging consists of Fai's own ideas, which have been pre-approved by the ISI but not provided by them."" According to the FBI affidavit, federal agents learned of the scheme from an unidentified informant who faced a U.S. jail term. The man told the FBI he had helped conceal the source of KAC funds, which he said originated with the ISI. The complaint states that Ahmad lined up donors within the United States to contribute to the KAC, ""in return for repayment of those amounts in Pakistan."" The informant said the money was transferred to Fai's organization via Ahmad, an American citizen living in Pakistan. Pakistan has been a U.S. ally in the battle against the al Qaeda terrorist network and the Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan. But relations between Islamabad and Washington have been strained by the American commando raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan and other issues. Federal campaign contribution records show Fai and Ahmad, also a U.S. citizen, contributed to a number of members of Congress between 1998 and 2008. The charges specifically link Pakistani funds to two 2004 contributions -- one by Ahmad and one by his nephew as a ""straw donor"" -- to members of Congress identified only as elected officials A and B. Based on FEC records, ""Elected Official A"" appears to be GOP Rep. Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania, who received a $2,000 contribution from Ahmad on the date mentioned in the affidavit. He got another $2,000 from Fai on the same day in September 2004, those records show. Pitts spokesman Andrew Wimer told CNN that the eight-term congressman has made $2,000 donations to two non-profits in his Lancaster-area district, the Water Street Mission and the Boys and Girls Club, since news of the charges broke. Fai, meanwhile, made personal contributions of $23,500, mostly to Republicans, who controlled Congress for most of the period. He gave $7,500 to GOP Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana, a self-proclaimed ""champion of Pakistan,"" between 1997 and 2010, FEC records show. In a statement posted on his congressional Web site, Burton said he was ""deeply shocked"" by Fai's arrest. ""For as long as I've known him, Dr. Fai has been either a permanent legal resident of the United States or a citizen and as such, any political contributions I may have received from Dr. Fai over the years are completely legal,"" Burton said. He said that in the 20 years he has known Fai, ""I had no inkling of his involvement with any foreign intelligence operation and had presumed our correspondence was legitimate."" ""However,"" he added, ""if there is any doubt about the origin of these contributions, I will donate those funds to the Boy Scouts of America."" The biggest chunk of Fai's contributions went to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, to which he gave $9,500 between 2004 and 2008, according to the Federal Election Commission. Fai also contributed $250 sums to two Democratic presidential campaigns, former Vice President Al Gore's 2000 effort and President Barack Obama's 2008 bid. The Justice Department said there was no evidence that any elected official who received contributions from Fai or the Kashmiri American Council knew the money ""originated from any part of the Pakistani government.""

"(CNN) -- The rumor blowing up Saturday was that Day 2 of the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival could feature a surprise appearance by electronica icons Daft Punk. According to the Twitterverse, it would probably take place during the set of headliners Phoenix. But when the special guest finally materialized on the main stage, it wasn't Daft Punk, it was R. Kelly. Yes, that R. Kelly. The controversial R&B legend's unexpected appearance prompted festival-goer Katy Perry to reference last year's popular Tupac appearance on Twitter: ""Production value has really gone up at (Coachella), it felt like R. Kelly was really there! #rkellyhologram"" Taking the stage near the end of night, Kelly joined the headliners for a mashup of their ""1901"" and his ""Ignition."" Kelly wasn't the only R&B artist to make a cameo at Coachella on Saturday. John Legend premiered his Benny Benassi-produced single ""Dance the Pain Away"" in the Sahara tent during the DJ's set, and Solange made a guest appearance during the performance of her friends the xx. Their special Coachella remix of their cover of Aaliyah's ""Hot Like Fire"" and Solange's ""Locked in Closets"" injected an upbeat energy into an otherwise moody set. Other Saturday crowd-pleasers included the Violent Femmes, who had fans dancing and singing along to their 1983 hits ""Blister in the Sun,"" ""Kiss Off"" and ""Add It Up."" Although the songs were released before most of the festival-goers were born, they were familiar because of their ubiquitous presence on Los Angeles radio station KROQ. Another Day 2 favorite was 2 Chainz, the Georgia rapper best known for the tracks ""I'm Different"" and ""Birthday Song."" Coachella organizers obviously underestimated his rabid fan base, and instead of slotting him onto the main stage, they relegated him to a much smaller tent. Admirers spilled out the back and sides of the tent as puffy clouds of smoke rose from the crowd. Moby made his first appearance at Coachella since 1999, the festival's debut year. Even though he's branched out as a musician in recent years, he returned to his DJ roots, playing the dance tent accompanied by visuals of outer space -- courtesy of his friends at NASA. ""When I was growing up, I was obsessed with science fiction,"" he said. ""And then I became obsessed with space and science, but I was a college dropout, so I was never smart enough to be a scientist. As a musician, I've made friends with people at NASA, so every couple of years, I find myself doing something with them. This is my hometown festival in some ways, and I only get nervous performing when I know people in the audience."" On the flip side, Janelle Monae trotted out her retro soul revue. The singer/funktress was eager to kick off her debut. ""I've heard a lot about the festival. This is my first time, so I'm excited about giving -- and having -- an experience that will be unforgettable.""

"(CNN) -- With gold prices officially in a bear market, investors must ask themselves if this is the time to buy? I remember a gold bug telling me at the beginning of the gold bull market, around 2010, that gold would hit $2000, guaranteed. It never did. Gold prices hit $1,888.70 in August 2011 and with Monday's big drop, it's now more than 20% off of that, even with Tuesday's slight bounce. Why? It depends on who you ask. Some say it's the slowing of the Chinese economy. Some say it's a slowdown in actual physical gold sales in the crucial India market. There is even a worry that European governments, from tiny Cyprus to far bigger Italy, might flood the market by selling off state-owned gold to raise funds. The only reason to speculate on the big price fall is if you care which way gold prices are heading now. All commodities are weakening at the moment; from oil to silver. But gold is supposed to have that extra luster. It's a safe haven investment after all. It's a hedge against inflation. And aren't we still in the midst of an economic crisis? Not if you look at share prices. In fact, analysts say people who are selling gold (or, more accurately, gold futures contracts since few people take delivery of physical gold if it's only an investment) are using the money to buy shares. Stocks with dividends give investors the chance to make a bit of money no matter what the market is doing. So, gold is not sexy anymore. If more people, or governments, decide to get out of gold, it will only go lower. Of course it has a long way to fall to get back to 1980s and 1990s when gold was under $500. Then it took off during the bubble years of the new century, only to gain even more traction as the much of the western world plunged into economic crisis. Now, it's a time of high unemployment, recession and austerity. Funny that gold is also suffering, while stocks hit record or multi-year highs. When will investors move money out of stocks and back into gold? Or will it take a steep drop in gold, similar to oil in the 2008, to bring investors back into the market?","Gold is considered a a safe haven asset and acts as a hedge against inflation .

"(CNN) -- Tomas Berdych has hovered around the edge of the ""big four"" of men's tennis for the past three years, but on Sunday he will take center stage in what could be a historic moment for his country. The Czech Republic has not won the Davis Cup since its split from Slovakia in 1993, but its men's team are poised follow up its women's success in the Fed Cup after taking a 2-1 lead in the final against defending champions Spain. The women retained their title in the tournament's 50th staging, and the men are battling to follow up Czechoslovakia's sole 1980 victory as the 100th edition of the Davis Cup comes to a climax in Prague. ""That's all we wanted,"" Berdych said after helping Radek Stepanek to defeat the ATP World Tour Finals champion partnership of Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez 3-6 7-5 7-5 6-3 in Saturday's doubles rubber. ""We are still missing a lot, it's just one point, but we are looking ahead and we will do everything."" Jubilant Czechs clinch 'amazing' Fed Cup title defense . Berdych is ranked sixth in the world in singles play, and 119th in doubles, but he has come to the fore in the Davis Cup this season with 10 wins from 10 matches. Friday's victory over Nicolas Almagro, which leveled the final, was his first over a Spanish player after three previous defeats -- including the 2009 final when the Czechs were whitewashed 5-0 in Barcelona. On Sunday he will play fifth-ranked David Ferrer, who has a leading seven tournament titles this year and 74 match wins -- second only behind world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. Ferrer has a 22-4 record in Davis Cup matches, including Friday's win over Stepanek, and he holds a 5-3 career advantage in matches against Berdych. Ferrer is also unbeaten in Davis Cup action this year, and is leading the Spanish team in the absence of the injured Rafael Nadal. If he beats Berdych in their first encounter this year, then the final will hinge on the fifth rubber between 37th-ranked Stepanek and world No. 11 Almagro. Almagro has an 8-3 Davis Cup record, but did not feature in last year's final or his country's triumphs in 2004, 2008, and 2009.","Czech Republic's men's team take 2-1 lead over Spain in the 100th Davis Cup final .

"(CNN) -- The Arkansas Department of Health says it has begun contacting about 100 patients -- ranging in age from 14 to 22 -- who were treated by Dr. William Jarrod Stewart at six dental clinics around the state between November 20, 2011, and February 20, 2012. The department is recommending that patients who fall into that time frame be screened for infection. Based on information received from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the health department has concluded that some of the drugs used by Stewart may have been contaminated with infectious material, the department said. Stewart had a substance abuse problem and completed a lengthy rehabilitation program in 2010, said Bill Trice, an attorney for the Arkansas Board of Dental Examiners. Stewart died on February 29, 2012, according to health department spokesman Ed Barham. After his death, the DEA conducted an audit and found two vials of the sedative Demerol that appeared to have been tampered with, Trice said. He said he could not confirm what infectious diseases may be involved, and it is not clear whether Stewart had any diseases. ""Some level of testing was performed on the vials, and so far no diseases have been found,"" Trice said. The warning, therefore, is mostly precautionary, he said. If Stewart were alive, the board of examiners would bring him in for testing, Trice said. In March, Oklahoma dentist Dr. W. Scott Harrington surrendered his license after that state's health investigators said patients may have been exposed to HIV and hepatitis at his suburban Tulsa clinic. The first lawsuit in that case -- which affects 7,000 patients -- was filed Monday. Christina Quin, whose wisdom teeth were removed by Harrington in 2009, filed a lawsuit seeking damages of more than $75,000 in Tulsa County. The lawsuit alleges that she became ill with an infection after the procedure. It took six weeks for Quin to recover from the unspecified infection, her attorney Patrick Carr said. She linked the infection to Harrington's office after hearing reports about it in March, the lawsuit said. ""We see this as a public safety matter ... there needs to be some investigation to see what happened,"" Carr said. ""This is the primary reason for filing this lawsuit."" Carr said his client does not have HIV or hepatitis. CNN's calls to Harrington's attorney James Secrest were not returned.

"Mountain View, California (CNN) -- Software developer Intuit isn't concerned about which of the two most popular applications for personal finance people choose. It owns both of them. Many families use either Quicken or Mint.com year-round to track budgets and review billing statements. Intuit, which also makes TurboTax, maintains the two personal-finance tools in tandem, and recent updates to each, such as the free Mint iPad app that launched on Wednesday or the major new version of Quicken that hit stores last month, are indicative of how different their audiences think about their money. Quicken 2012 has a revamped look and a new debt-reduction-planning feature. Quicken comes in many flavors and can cost anywhere from $30 to $150, with one advertisement for a Quicken credit card shown infrequently. It's only available for Windows, and it stores data on the user's computer, which is important for the security-minded but prevents people from accessing their accounts from multiple devices. On the other hand, Mint's website and applications, which can all provide access to a single account's information stored on Intuit's servers, are free with ads for cards, banks and insurance companies tailored to a user's spending habits sprinkled throughout. Mint seems to push out updates to its website and mobile apps constantly, but the iPad version was a long-awaited release for many people who use the service regularly. The two tools take different approaches to money management and have each found niches. Quicken has been around for nearly 30 years, whereas Mint was founded in 2006 and was acquired by Intuit just a couple of years ago. ""Changing people's habits is hard,"" Intuit co-founder Scott Cook said in a recent interview. ""Mint is for the person who doesn't want to think. They don't want to track or check anything."" Quicken still has a sizable customer base, and people keep buying it because access to online services expires after about 31/2 years. At least three versions of Quicken 2012 appear in the top 50 for software sold on Amazon.com, but an Intuit spokeswoman declined to provide sales data. She said Mint has more than 7 million users. About a third of Quicken customers buy a new version every year, and another third upgrade every three years, said Eddy Wu, an Intuit senior product manager. Presumably, the last third either loses interest in tracking their bills or switches to something like Mint. One might assume that Quicken users are obsessively tabulating each transaction they make rather than letting computers do the thinking, either due to a mistrust of their banks or a mistrust in storing their sensitive info in the cloud. However, more people are using the automatic input mechanisms provided by financial institutions, while only 20% to 30% of Quicken users input manually, according to Wu's research at Intuit. ""Most people don't like to do all that manual data entry,"" Wu said. ""People aren't as scared of the Internet anymore."" So Intuit has beefed up Quicken's Web-based features. If people choose not to use these features, they can bask in the safety of keeping everything on their own machines. The Mint and Quicken teams keep each other informed about what they're working on for their respective software, but the development teams are separate, Wu said. Intuit is mulling how it might converge the two apps, or at least make them more interoperable, but it has no immediate plans to build that bridge, he said. Intuit has managed to ward off many competitors over the years. Microsoft made several attempts of its own, most notably with the Microsoft Money program. When it struggled to make inroads and then failed in its $1.5 billion bid to acquire Intuit in 1994 due to federal antitrust concerns, Microsoft retreated. According to Cook, who founded Intuit with Tom Proulx, Microsoft's Bill Gates admitted to him privately, ""We thought we could copy your products, but we couldn't copy your word of mouth.""","Intuit makes some of the most popular financial management programs .

"(CNN) -- Principal Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung just entered a Ph.D. program. She led a school district's strategic planning panel. She won a national school grant. She could be ""a tough lady in the right sort of sense,"" a friend said. Among it all, she found time to smile and exuded memorable enthusiasm. The longtime educator's career seemed to be peaking when she became principal two years ago of Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, which has 525 pupils from kindergarten to fourth grade. On Friday, Hochsprung, 47, was fatally shot inside her school in a massacre that killed five other adults and 20 students. The shooter killed himself; his mother was found dead in a Newtown house, said a law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation. Hochsprung was an affable but serious leader, recalled Tom Prunty, a friend whose niece goes to Sandy Hook and was uninjured Friday. Share your tributes . ""She was really nice and very fun, but she was also very much a tough lady in the right sort of sense,"" Prunty said. ""She was the kind of person you'd want to be educating your kids. And the kids loved her. ""Even little kids know when someone cares about them, and that was her,"" he said. Hochsprung majored in special education for her bachelor's and master's degrees in the 1990s, and she rose through the ranks, working in elementary, middle and high schools in Connecticut's small communities. The Connecticut Board of Education appointed Hochsprung as Sandy Hook's principal on June 9, 2010. She came to Newtown with 12 years of administrative experience, including as a principal in Regional School District 14 serving the Connecticut communities of Bethlehem and Danbury, the Newtown Bee reported. At home in Woodbury, Connecticut, Hochsprung was busy raising two daughters and three stepdaughters. Comforting survivors: 'Hug them' and 'cry with them' She also dove into her work, quickly asserting her leadership and implementing a number of initiatives affecting the school's nearly 700 students from about 500 families. One of them was overseeing the installation of a new security system requiring every visitor to ring the front entrance's doorbell after the doors locked at 9:30 a.m. If they were buzzed into the front office, parents would be asked for photo identification. Hochsprung also volunteered to be co-chairman of a strategic planning commission for the school district, said Scott Clayton, former assistant principal at Newtown High School, who left this year to become a principal in another district. The commission post is a weighty, important job, said Clayton, who worked with Hochsprung on the panel. ""She was extremely passionate. And she was especially dedicated to and knowledgeable about curriculum,"" Clayton said. ""This was a deep loss for the community."" Last summer, Hochsprung was one of 15 educators accepted into the doctorate program at Esteves School of Education at the Sage Colleges in New York, the college said. She was the first person from Connecticut accepted into the 27-month program, said Dean Lori V. Quigley. Massacre leaves many asking, 'Where's God?' Hochsprung made the biggest impression of the group with her smile and enthusiasm, Quigley said. ""She was truly a caring administrator,"" Quigley said, adding Hochsprung was proud to represent her school. In 2011, Hochsprung won a school grant called Sharing the Dream from the National Association of Elementary School Principals. The grant creates global awareness in schools and international learning communities. She proudly posted notes and photos on her Twitter account about her school's activities. ""Setting up for the Sandy Hook nonfiction book preview for staff ... Common Core, here we come!"" she wrote on Thursday, her most recent tweet. A photo depicted several children's books, including ""Alligator or Crocodile? How Do You Know?"" Another photo shows a choir of boys and girls dressed in white shirts and black pants or skirts being led by the music teacher. The audience was all students. How do we stop the violence? ""Sandy Hook students enjoy the rehearsal for our 4th grade winter concert - a talented group led by Maryrose Kristopik!"" Hochsprung tweeted Wednesday. Kristopik is listed as music teacher on the school's website. On her principal's page of the school website, Hochsprung emphasizes the school's ""rich history of establishing high expectations and sustaining strong academic performance."" ""Our Responsive Classroom approach focuses on the benefits of a climate of kindness and respect where all community members feel accepted, important, and secure,"" Hochsprung wrote. In her two years at Sandy Hook, the principal came across as a ""very well-liked, compassionate woman"" who was ""extremely helpful,"" said Aimee Seaver, a mother of a first grader. Hochsprung brought positive energy, sincerity and a strong work ethic to the job -- qualities that will be sorely missed, added Seaver. ""I never saw her without a smile,"" Seaver said. ""I believe she had the children's best intentions (in mind) all the time. She was always looking out for them."" Complete coverage on the Connecticut school shooting .

"(CNN) -- Lawmakers in Moscow moved Friday to ban Americans from adopting Russian children, passing a bill that imposes a series of sanctions on U.S. interests, state media reported. Russia is one of the top countries of origin for international adoptions in the United States. The State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, adopted the bill on its third reading, the state-run RAPSI news agency reported. The measure will now move to the Federation Council and, if approved there, will go to President Vladimir Putin to be signed into law, the news agency said. Read more: Russian lawmakers eye adoption ban to U.S. The legislation could affect hundreds of American families seeking to adopt Russian children. It also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the United States, if such activities may affect Russian interests, the news agency said, and imposes sanctions against U.S. officials thought to have violated human rights. The move by Russian politicians is widely seen as retaliation for a law that U.S. President Barack Obama signed December 14. That bill, called the Magnitsky Act, imposes U.S. travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in Russia. ""The United States is concerned by measures in the bill passed in the Russian Duma today that, if it becomes law, would halt inter-country adoptions between the United States and Russia and would restrict the ability of Russian civil society organizations to work with American partners,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said. The Magnitsky act is named in honor of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country's history in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state. Magnitsky died in 2009 after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death. Russian leaders have criticized the bill, which also places sanctions on those involved in the tax fraud Magnitsky uncovered and those responsible for his detention, abuse, and death. The bill passed by the State Duma is named in turn after Dima Yakovlev, a 2-year-old boy who died while in the care of a U.S. adoptive family, RAPSI said. Its implementation would nullify a recent agreement between the United States and Russia in which the countries agreed to additional safeguards to protect children and parties involved in inter-country adoptions. ""American families have welcomed more than 60,000 Russian children into American homes over the past 20 years,"" Ventrell said. ""Just last month we implemented a bilateral adoptions agreement with Russia to improve safeguards for adopted children and their families. If Russian officials have concerns about the implementation of this agreement, we stand ready to work with them to improve it and remain committed to supporting inter-country adoptions between our two countries."" Only China has more adoptions to the United States than Russia. Backers of the Russian bill said American adoptive parents have been abusive, citing 19 deaths of Russian children by their adoptive parents since the 1990s, according to local media. In 2010, an American woman caused outrage after she sent her adopted son back to Russia alone on a one-way flight, saying the boy, then 7, had violent episodes that made the family fear for its safety. Amnesty International called on Russian lawmakers Thursday to reject their measure, which it said would ""have a chilling effect on human rights defenders and civil society"" and end adoptions to the United States. ""There is a huge risk that the vaguely worded provisions in this bill will be used to clamp down on government critics and exposers of abuses. Indeed this would appear to be its real purpose,"" said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's Europe and Central Asia program director. ""This bill is frankly a childish response to the Magnitsky Act,"" he said. ""The Duma should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen Russian civil society and not weaken it."" CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Joseph Netto contributed to this report.","NEW: The United States expresses ""concern"" about the measures in the bill .

"(CNN)  -- The head of the U.N. Children's Fund has expressed concern over a Saudi judge's refusal for a second time to annul a marriage between an 8-year-old girl and a 47-year-old man. UNICEF's Ann Veneman said consent cannot be free if either party is too young to make an informed decision. ""Irrespective of circumstances or the legal framework, the marriage of a child is a violation of that child's rights,"" said Ann Veneman, executive director of UNICEF. ""The right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Consent cannot be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision."" The most recent ruling, in which the judge upheld his original verdict, was handed down Saturday in the Saudi city of Onaiza, where late last year the same judge rejected a petition from the girl's mother, seeking a divorce for her daughter. Have your say by clicking here . A relative said the judge, Sheikh Habib al-Habib, ""stuck by his earlier verdict and insisted that the girl could petition the court for a divorce once she reached puberty."" The family member, who requested anonymity, added that the mother will continue to pursue a divorce for her daughter. The case, which has drawn criticism from local and international rights groups, came to light in December when al-Habib declined to annul the marriage on a legal technicality. The judge ruled that the girl's mother -- who is separated from her father -- was not the girl's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court, Abdullah al-Jutaili, the mother's attorney, told CNN at the time. The girl's father, according to the lawyer, arranged the marriage in order to settle his debts with the man, who is a close friend of his. At the time of the initial verdict, the judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty, al-Jutaili told CNN. The judge ruled that when the girl reaches puberty, she will have the right to request a divorce by filing a petition with the court, the lawyer said. Last month, an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh declined to certify the original ruling, in essence rejecting al-Habib's verdict, and sent the case back to him for reconsideration. Under the complicated Saudi legal process, the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect, but that a challenge to the marriage was still ongoing. The appeals court in Riyadh will now take up the case again and a hearing is scheduled for next month, according to the relative. The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom recently. While rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages, the kingdom's top cleric has said that it's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed. ""It is incorrect to say that it's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger,"" Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom's grand mufti, said in remarks last January, according to the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. ""A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong, and they are being unfair to her."" Al-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry. ""We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls,"" he said, according to the newspaper. ""We should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women."" Sharia law is Islamic law. Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism. CNN was unable to reach government officials for comment. Christoph Wilcke, a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch, told CNN in December that his organization has heard of many other cases of child marriages. ""We've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the Saudi public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men,"" Wilcke said. Wilcke said that although Saudi ministries might make decisions designed to protect children, ""It is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts, and in many realms beyond the court."" In December, Zuhair al-Harithi, a spokesman for the Saudi government-run Human Rights Commission, said his organization is fighting against child marriages. ""The Human Rights Commission opposes child marriages in Saudi Arabia,"" al-Harithi said. ""Child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed."" He added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place. Wajeha al-Huwaider, co-founder of the Society of Defending Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, told CNN that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to ""keep us backward and in the dark ages."" She said the marriages cause girls to ""lose their sense of security and safety. Also, it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured. It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression.""","UNICEF: Marriage of a child is a violation of that child's rights .

"New York (CNN) -- Hugh Jackman got a bit more of a workout this weekend than he bargained for. A woman allegedly screamed ""I love you"" as she chased the actor with an electric razor while he was at a New York City gym Saturday, police and Jackman's publicist say. ""He was more alarmed than scared,"" publicist Alan Nierob told CNN Sunday. Jackman thought the woman was grabbing for a weapon, he said. Manhattan resident Katherine Thurston, 47, was charged with stalking Jackman, according to New York Police spokesman Sgt. Tom Antonetti. Thurston could not be reached immediately for comment, and it was not immediately clear whether she is being represented by an attorney. Jackman has seen the woman before outside of his home and his daughter's school, Nierob said. Police interviewed Jackman and a witness at Gotham Gym. They told police the woman took out the razor inside the gym and followed Jackman ""for an extended period of time."" Mike Castle, a trainer at Gotham Gym, saw Thurston enter the facility. She was crying as she slipped past the check-in desk, he said, and headed straight toward Jackman. ""The razor fell out of her hands when I stepped in between them,"" Castle said.

"(CNN) -- A U.N. report says Afghanistan, the world's biggest producer of opium, is also a ""major producer of cannabis"" and ""the world's biggest producer of hashish."" The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime issued its Afghanistan Cannabis Survey on Wednesday, documenting large-scale cannabis cultivation in half of Afghanistan's 34 provinces. ""While other countries have even larger cannabis cultivation, the astonishing yield of the Afghan cannabis crop -- 145 kilograms per hectare of hashish, the resin produced from cannabis, as compared to around 40 kilograms per hectare in Morocco -- makes Afghanistan the world's biggest producer of hashish, estimated at between 1,500 and 3,500 tons a year,"" said Antonio Maria Costa, UNODC's executive director, in a report issued at the agency's headquarters in Vienna, Austria. The survey results reflect the significance of Afghanistan's illicit drug trade, exploited by militants to fund their operations in unstable areas, such as the country's war-torn southern region. In 2008, ""a massive seizure of cannabis -- 245,000 kilograms -- was made in Kandahar near the Pakistan border."" ""All drugs in Afghanistan, whether opium or cannabis, are taxed by those who control the territory, providing an additional source of revenue for insurgents,"" Costa said. The study said the high concentration of cannabis cultivation in the south ""marks a shift away from the north, which even five years ago, was the main cannabis-growing region. Illustrative of this trend is the steep increase in cannabis prices in Balkh province"" because of a crackdown since 2007. The report says money ""is one of the main reasons"" for large-scale cannabis cultivation. ""The gross income per hectare of cannabis (US $3,900) is higher than from opium (US$ 3,600). Cannabis does not need much labor cost: in Afghanistan it is three times cheaper to cultivate a hectare of cannabis than a hectare of opium. ""As a result, the net income of a hectare of cannabis is US $3,341 compared to US $2,005 per hectare of opium. In the aggregate, however, because opium cultivation far exceeds cannabis cultivation, in 2009 the value of cannabis resin production in Afghanistan was estimated at between US $39-94 million, about 10-20 percent of the farmgate value of opium production."" Costa said the report shows that Afghanistan's drug problem ""is even more complex than just the opium trade."" ""Reducing Afghanistan's cannabis supply should be dealt with more seriously as part of the national drug control strategy. As with opium, the bottom line is to improve security and development in drug-producing regions in order to wean farmers off of illicit crops and into sustainable, licit livelihoods, and to deny insurgents another source of illicit income.""","Afghanistan gets ""astonishing"" yield of hashish from its cannabis crop, U.N. report says .

"Washington (CNN) -- In a meeting rife with angry and emotional exchanges, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved a new ban on semiautomatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons. The measure now goes to the full Senate for consideration as part of a package of gun measures prompted by a Connecticut school massacre last December that killed 20 first graders. However, the proposed ban has little chance of becoming law due to fierce opposition by the National Rifle Association and a certain GOP filibuster. Even supporters acknowledged the difficulty ahead in passing an updated version of a similar ban that became law in 1994 and expired without congressional re-authorization a decade letter. Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island said he doubted whether the new prohibition could get the 60 votes needed for passage. Instead, Whitehouse called for breaking off a provision that would limit ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, saying he believed it could win Senate approval as a separate measure. Sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the proposed ban won approval from the Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote with 10 Democrats supporting it and eight Republicans opposed. The panel previously approved other proposals that would expand background checks on all gun sales and enact tougher laws against firearms trafficking and straw purchases. Analysts believe those have a better chance of clearing the Senate. Heated debate by committee members on Thursday showed the partisan divide over gun legislation, as well as the challenge supporters face in getting any substantive measures through Congress. At one point, Feinstein and Chairman Pat Leahy, D-Vermont, reacted sharply to remarks by freshman Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, about the need for the committee to legislate based on facts and the Constitution instead of passion over the gun issue ignited by the Newtown, Connecticut, killings. When Cruz asked if Feinstein believed the First Amendment also could be limited in the same way he contended the proposed ban would limit the Second Amendment right to bear arms, she shot back: ""I'm not a sixth grader."" Noting her 20 years on the committee and experience as mayor of San Francisco, she said in a rising voice how she had seen ""bodies that have been shot with these weapons,"" adding that the schoolchildren killed in Newtown ""were dismembered"" by the bullets. ""I've studied the Constitution myself. I am reasonably well-educated and I thank you for the lecture,"" she continued, noting her bill exempts 2,271 weapons from the ban. ""Isn't that enough for the people in the United States? Do they need a bazooka? Do they need other high-powered weapons that military people use to kill in close combat? I don't think so,"" she said. She concluded by telling Cruz that ""I come from a different place than you do. I respect your views. I ask you to respect my views."" Cruz and other Republicans on the committee contended that Feinstein's proposal would prevent law-abiding gun owners from possessing weapons of choice, while criminals would still be able to get them to leave people unable to properly defend themselves. ""Why would you deny for defensive purposes otherwise law-abiding citizens to be able to use an equivalent firepower to defend themselves?"" argued Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. ""It's not much satisfaction to say that criminals are gonna have access to the whole range of weapons that they will have access to because they don't care about the laws that are passed. And we're gonna give the American citizen a pea shooter to defend themselves with."" President Barack Obama called for the legislative steps in response to the massacre in Newtown by a lone gunman armed with an assault weapon that jolted the nation. The Senate panel passed versions of much of the package Obama proposed, but Republicans made their opposition clear. ""Now the full Senate and the House need to vote on this bill, as well as the measures advanced in the past week,"" Obama said in a statement on Thursday. One measure by Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York would mandate background checks for all gun sales, including private transactions. It would also require increased cooperation by states with the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and would prohibit people deemed by the courts as unfit to own guns from obtaining them. Cornyn said Thursday that he would propose amendments to Schumer's bill on the Senate floor, and he also mentioned that a bipartisan substitute to the measure could be offered. The NRA has said increased checks are nothing more than an attempt to create a national gun registry, a move the group vehemently opposes. Leahy challenged such assertions on Thursday, saying in a toughly worded final statement that opponents of gun legislation should stop spreading false information about the panel's proposals. ""Second Amendment rights are not at risk,"" he said. ""Let's not put an issue out here that's not out here. But lives are at risk."" Reflecting on his decades on the panel, Leahy called for members of both parties to ""come together to become a safer and more secure society."" ""We do not need false charges about gun registries and gun registration to scare people when no such thing is being proposed or will be proposed,"" he said. Another measure approved by the panel earlier this week would establish a framework for the Department of Education to set safety guidelines aimed at protecting schools from gun violence.

"(CNN) -- Arizona will appeal a judge's decision to overturn the murder conviction and death sentence of Debra Milke, the state's attorney general announced Friday. A jury convicted Milke of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, child abuse and kidnapping on October 12, 1990, less than a year after her 4-year-old son was found dead. She was sentenced to death a few months later. But on Thursday, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned her conviction after determining she did not receive a fair trial. His rationale was that prosecutors did not disclose the ""history of misconduct"" of its key witness, a Phoenix police detective, who had testified that Milke confessed to being involved in a plot to kill her son. Unbeknownst to the defense or to the jury, previous judges had tossed out four confessions or indictments because Detective Armando Saldate Jr. had lied under oath, among other issues. Arizona woman's murder conviction, death sentence overturned . But Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne challenged Kozinski's decision, vowing Friday to personally argue on the state's behalf if the U.S. Supreme Court takes the appeal. ""Ms. Milke was found to have arranged the killing of her own son, a four-year-old toddler, because he was too much of a burden and interfering with her life,"" Horne said in a written statement. ""... This is a horrible crime. The Ninth Circuit's decision needs to be reversed, and justice for Christopher needs to be served."" A day after seeing Santa Claus at a mall, young Christopher Milke asked his mother if he could go again. That was the plan, she said, when the boy got into the car with Milke's roommate, James Styers. Styers picked up a friend, ""but instead of heading to the mall, the two men drove the boy out of town to a secluded ravine, where Styers shot Christopher three times in the head,"" according to Kozinski's summary of the case. Styers was convicted of first-degree murder in the boy's killing and sentenced to death. During her trial, ""no ... witnesses or direct evidence (linked) Milke to the crime"" other than Saldate . The detective questioned Milke -- an interrogation that wasn't recorded or witnessed by anyone else -- and later claimed she'd confessed to her role in the murder conspiracy, saying it was a ""bad judgment call."" But Milke offered a vastly different view of the interrogation and denied that she had admitted to any role in a murder plot. ""The judge and jury believed Saldate,"" Kozinski wrote Thursday. ""But they didn't know about Saldate's long history of lying under oath and other misconduct."" Kozinski, chiding prosecutors for remaining ""unconstitutionally silent"" about the detective's background, overturned the conviction and set the stage for Milke's release from prison unless the state quickly presses forward with a retrial. Horne, the Arizona attorney general, argues that the 49-year-old woman should remain on death row, given his understanding of what happened. ""After dressing him up and telling him he was going to the mall to see Santa Claus, Milke was convicted of sending her young son off to be shot, execution style, in a desert wash,"" he said. CNN's Deanna Hackney contributed to this report.","Debra Milke was convicted of murder in her son's death and given the death penalty .

"(CNN) -- Two Iranian warships sailed through Egypt's Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea, Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency reported Saturday, amid heightened tensions in the region. The move represents only the second time such ships have crossed the Suez Canal since the Islamic republic's 1979 revolution. The first time took place in February 2011, just days after Egypt's post-Hosni Mubarak government gave the green light to the passage -- putting Egypt's new military leaders in a prickly position with its Israeli neighbor. ""As the Navy affected the region with its presence in the Mediterranean Sea last year, the Navy's 18th fleet will in the best way carry the message of peace and friendship to regional countries, and display the might of the country and the sacred system of the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" said Rear Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, according to Mehr. It was not clear from the report where the two vessels, a destroyer and a supply ship, were headed. However, another semi-official Iranian news agency, ISNA, said the ships were on their way to Syria. The canal is an internal body of water, and as such, Egypt has sovereignty over it. But Egypt also is bound by the 1978 Camp David Accords, which guarantee the right of free passage by ships belonging to Israel and all other nations on the basis of the Constantinople Convention of 1888. The warships' reported movement comes as tensions between Iran and Israel are high, with speculation of a pre-emptive Israeli strike on Iran to stop its suspected nuclear weapons program. Israel has also blamed Tehran for attacks on Israeli targets in India, Georgia and Thailand. The United States and the European Union bolstered sanctions against Iran after a November report by the International Atomic Energy Agency that said Iran could be developing nuclear weapons. Iran insists its program is strictly for civilian energy purposes. On Friday, Western nations welcomed a letter from Iran offering a resumption of stalled nuclear talks, though they were still determining the Islamic republic's sincerity. The Suez Canal is a key waterway for international trade. It connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, allowing ships to navigate between Europe and Asia without having to go around Africa. Millions of barrels of oil move through the Suez every day en route to Europe and North America. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","NEW: The ships are reportedly heading to Syria .

"(CNN) -- Microsoft has announced its Surface tablets, due out late this year, at a time when security is a growing concern for users of mobile devices. And when most consumers think security, Microsoft probably isn't the first brand to spring to mind. But are Surface tablets likely to be any more or less secure than the iPad or Android tablets? That could depend on which Surface model you're talking about. But in general, these devices probably won't pose any significant additional security risks to mobile users. Microsoft said there will be two versions of Surface. The first, due out this fall, will run the not-yet-released Windows RT operating system -- a tablet-based version of the Windows Phone OS, which will only run apps adapted for Microsoft's tile-based ""Metro"" user interface. So far, Microsoft has offered few hardcore details about this system. But the tech news site Pocket Lint offered a good rundown of what to expect from Windows RT. The higher-end second Surface tablet, probably due out a few months later, will run the full Windows 8 operating system. This OS also has not yet been released, but a consumer preview has been available for several months. At a conference Tuesday, Collin Davis, senior director of development for Symantec's Norton line of security software, explained that so far it's hard to say exactly what types of security concerns Windows RT devices might pose. But security experts know a fair bit about Windows 8. ""It's a lot like the current desktop version of Windows we have today, so its security issues will probably be very similar,"" he said. ""Microsoft raised the security bar considerably a few years ago when they introduced Microsoft Security Essentials,"" Davis added, referring to software has since been rebranded as Microsoft Defender. It offers a level of protection against threats such as spyware, botnets, phishing attacks, websites that install malicious code and more. ""We know that Windows 8 will include Defender,"" Davis said. The ""bad guys"" who develop malware and other security threats pay close attention to the level of security built into Microsoft products, since Windows remains the most popular computer operating system in the world. And right now, those bad guys are busily updating their code, Davis said. Hackers today can already exploit Windows 7 and soon should be able to exploit Windows 8, he said. One key difference in Windows 8 is that it's two operating systems in one. It offers a regular Windows desktop interface as well as Microsoft's newer ""Metro"" interface -- the tile-based design that's the hallmark of Windows Phone. In contrast, the first model of the Surface tablet (Windows RT only) will only offer the Metro interface, so it won't be able to run the full versions of many desktop apps popular with Windows users, such as Photoshop. ""From a security perspective, we expect this device to be about the same as what we see with current mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS,"" Davis said. According to Networked World, Windows RT might offer some security advantages for large organizations: ""Microsoft can perform a type of network access control on Windows RT devices as a way to protect corporate networks from harm ... making them a cut above iPads and Android tablets in this regard."" If you're concerned about security, you can purchase extra security software such as Norton or other products from various vendors, many of which have mobile apps. For the Windows 8 version of Surface, such software could provide additional protection above what Microsoft Defender offers. In the big picture for mobile, so far the vast majority of mobile security threats are malware that target Android devices. The open nature of the Android OS and the ease with which Android apps can be distributed through the Google Play store make this possible. So users of Android devices, including tablets, should be especially careful of security risks. Despite popular opinion that Apple devices are inherently more secure and despite ongoing Windows security problems such as the pernicious Conficker worm, Microsoft may actually be better at security overall than Apple. Security expert Eugene Kaspersky recently told Computer Business Review that Apple is ""10 years behind Microsoft in terms of security."" Kaspersky was referring to Macintosh computers, but his comments might also apply to iPhones and iPads. Simply because Windows has long been the world's most popular computer operating system by a long shot, it has been a far more attractive target for bad guys seeking to exploit security holes. Thus Microsoft has far more experience with spotting, combating and communicating about security issues. Whether this expertise ends up making these new Windows tablets extra secure remains to be seen. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Microsoft announced its Surface tablets this week .

"(CNN) -- Today is the 45th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a champion for freedom, civil rights and justice. I was blessed to be with him the last weekend before his death. I remember the trauma he felt as a result of his opposition to the war in Vietnam. Before going to Memphis, King had the Rev. Ralph Abernathy call for a staff meeting in his church study on a Saturday morning. His close aides came. King complained that he had felt the pain of ""a migraine headache for four days."" He said, ""Maybe I've done as much as I could. We've come from the back of the bus, gotten the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act..."" One of us -- Andy Young -- asked him not to talk that way. King responded, ""Don't say peace when there is no peace."" Many of his supporters had turned against him because of his position on the war in Vietnam, but King felt he had to do what was right. He contended, ""There are those who want me to confine my morality to the war on poverty and overlook the war in Vietnam. However, the bombs in Vietnam ultimately explode at home because of poverty."" He contemplated fasting until he was near the point of death, anticipating that ""those who disagree with me would come to my bedside and we could reconcile."" But then he shook off his pessimism and declared, ""Let's turn a minus into a plus, like we did before. Let's make this nation deal forthrightly with the issue of poverty."" It was with this insight in mind that we went on to Memphis to work with sanitation workers. Beyond their work and their stained uniforms, these workers wanted their children to graduate from college and to attain the American dream. King was invited to speak at the Mason Temple church, but he still suffered from a migraine headache. He sent Abernathy and me in his place. It was a big space, and everyone applauded, assuming King was behind us. We went to the back of the church and called King to tell him he had to come, even if not for long. He came. That night, he gave the now famous ""mountaintop"" speech. Yet, Memphis is memorable less for the accolades for King than for the condemnations of him. We idolize him now as a martyr; we but rejected him as a marcher. Dr. King was invested in the war on poverty, but the federal government and the media were invested in the war in Vietnam. He was invested in justice, but many in the world were invested in the status quo. He was vilified, lied to, spied upon, jailed and threatened. Sick and misguided people wanted to see Dr. King dead, but he represented a truth that lives cannot deter, that jails cannot confine, and bullets cannot kill. Those who shot him meant it for evil, but instead they shot him into immortality. King cannot be buried. When confronted with a dilemma, King often said that we face three questions: First, our vanity asks ""Is it popular?"" Second, politics asks the question ""Can it win?"" Finally, conscience asks the question, ""Is it right?"" It may be neither popular nor politic, King argued, but if it is right it will prevail. In the time since King saw his vision from the mountaintop, much has changed for the better. Three women have been appointed to the Supreme Court; voting has become more democratic; women sit on juries as well as men; students vote en masse. We now have a black president and our state legislatures and local governments are comprised of people who are black, Asian, Hispanic, white, female and male. Ultimately though, King's work was not about complexion, but direction. He fought for freedom, but equality was the next stage. Freedom was the absence of barbarism and sickness; the fight for equality is a move towards sharing resources. Former allies in the freedom movement would not necessarily be our allies in the equality movement. We may go to sporting events together, like when the New Orleans Saints play the Atlanta Falcons, but when the game is over we rarely vote together, do not share capital and grow together. We are missing an opportunity and growing apart. While we struggle over the battles of sequestration and fiscal cliffs, we ignore the growth of poverty. Instead of horizontal divergence based on race, we now face vertical polarization that separates the haves from the have-nots. There is no apparent plan for reconstruction. If King were alive today, I imagine he would cry out for new priorities. He could not rest with the new forms of war and old forms of poverty. He would abhor the political polarization that is the new normal in American life. He would challenge the rhetoric of states rights and its attempt to undermine a more perfect union. King fought for democracy over Democrats, the republic over Republicans, a one big-tent America: everybody in and nobody out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jesse Jackson.","Today is the 45th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

"(CNN) -- The United States declined Monday to surrender an undisclosed number of detainees during the handover of a prison to Afghan control, a spokesman for the American-led coalition in Afghanistan said. The handover of Parwan prison at Bagram Air Base was the linchpin in a larger agreement that outlines the gradual transfer of power from U.S. forces to Afghanistan as American troops prepare to withdraw. A coalition official told CNN the United States is holding on to several Afghan detainees because of concerns about whether Afghan authorities will properly handle their cases and under what circumstances they might be released. The U.S. also is keeping several prisoners of other nationalities who were not part of the agreement, the source said. U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Afghan President Hamid Karzai spoke by telephone Monday about the brewing controversy. Pentagon spokesman George Little said the two leaders ""expressed a shared commitment to implement the terms of the memorandum of understanding on detention operations in Afghanistan."" Roughly 99% of the detainees in custody before the agreement was signed in March have been turned over to Afghan authorities, Jamie Graybeal, a spokesman for coalition, said by telephone. ""We have paused the transfer of the remaining detainees until our concerns are met,"" he said. Graybeal declined to release the number of detainees still in U.S. custody, citing operational security. The detainees in question are believed to be high-value Taliban and Haqqani network militants. The U.S. military has not publicly identified them. The U.S. military also is temporarily halting the handover of any detainees taken into custody after the agreement was signed in March. Graybeal did not outline what the concerns were or what steps needed to be taken before the U.S. military agreed to turnover the detainees. While the handover ceremony at Bagram occurred Monday despite the U.S. military's refusal to surrender the detainees, the issue will likely be a sticking point between Afghan President Hamid Karzai and U.S. military leaders. Karzai has been adamant that all prisoners be under the control of Afghan authorities. As late as last week, there was an indication of a possible disagreement between Karzai and U.S. Marine Gen. John Allen, commander of NATO troops. In November, a loyal jirga, or grand assembly of Afghan elders, endorsed the continued presence of U.S. forces following the end of combat operations in 2014, though only if the two countries could agree on the transfer of prisoners, the end to night raids and lifting immunity for U.S. troops accused of committing crimes. Karzai more recently released a statement following a meeting with Allen in which he said that under the agreement, ""the prison is now supposed to be transferred to Afghan government and thus any delay in its handover is considered a breach of Afghan national sovereignty.""","NEW: U.S. defense secretary, Afghan president talk by phone about controversy .

"(CNN) -- Jurors began deliberations Wednesday in the trial of five current or former police officers in connection with shootings on a New Orleans bridge in the chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The shootings occurred on Danziger Bridge on September 4, 2005, six days after much of New Orleans went underwater after the powerful hurricane slammed into the Gulf Coast. Prosecutors contend the officers opened fire, killing 17-year-old James Brissette. Minutes later, an officer allegedly shot and killed 40-year-old Ronald Madison. Four others were wounded in the shootings. Kenneth Bowen, Robert Gisevius, Robert Faulcon and Anthony Villavasoare are charged in the shooting. They are also accused of covering up the incident, with the help of the fifth defendant -- former detective Arthur Kaufman. During closing arguments Tuesday, the defense asked the jury to consider the stressful circumstances the officers were operating under following Katrina. The shootings took place during a week of dire flooding, rampant looting and death by drowning. Police were strained, beset by suicides and desertion. The prosecution put it more bluntly, calling the officers' actions ""murder, plain and simple."" Similar charges had been filed after local prosecutors first investigated the shootings, but no one was convicted. Federal prosecutors then moved in and launched an investigation. Other officers have already been convicted in connection with the shootings. They include Michael Hunter, who pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy to obstruct justice. Hunter was sentenced to eight years in prison. According to court documents, Hunter drove in a rental truck to Danziger Bridge with other officers to respond to a radio call about gunshots and reports that officers on the nearby Interstate 10 bridge had come under fire. At the time, New Orleans police said they got into a running gunbattle with several people. That's when officers encountered the Madison brothers, Ronald and Lance. Lance Madison told CNN he and his brother Ronald left their flooded home and were crossing the bridge to find shelter. They were unwittingly headed to an area where armed looters were marauding, he said. Lance Madison said police officers were the only ones shooting as he and his brother ran for safety from the area. A witness told CNN in 2006 that police shot Ronald Madison in the back as he ran toward a motel at the bottom of the bridge. ""Hunter ... admitted that he was present on the west side of the Danziger Bridge when an officer, identified as Officer A, shot and killed Ronald Madison, a civilian who was running away from officers with his hands in view, and did not have a weapon or pose a threat,"" the Justice Department said. Hunter admitted that officers on the east side of the Danziger Bridge fired at civilians, even though the same civilians did not appear to have any weapons, the Justice Department said.","The defense asks jury to consider stressful post-Katrina circumstances .
