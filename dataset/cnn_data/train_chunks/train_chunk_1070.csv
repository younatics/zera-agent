"A Detroit family is demanding justice for their daughter and sister — after the newlywed 25-year-old was tragically killed when a parolee leading cops in a high-speed chase broadsided her car. Francesca Vitale Weatherhead was driving to her job as a sales manager when the man ran a red light on his Ford Escape and struck her car on Oct. 6. Her accused killer: 27-year-old John McCallum, who has a mile-long rap sheet for a series of charges including break-ins, possession of weapons and drugs and larceny. Newlywed Francesca Vitale, 25, was struck and killed by an ex-con who had just been released on parole — and quickly returned to a life of crime. He was fleeing cops after yet another home break-in when he killed her . Francesca had recently married Matthew Weatherhead and was putting her husband through medical school. Wedding photos courtesy of Mishelle Lamarand Photography . John McCallum, 27, has a mile-long rap sheet that includes charges for break-ins, weapons and drugs . McCallum had been paroled not five months prior — despite being sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison on his latest break-in and drug possession arrest, the Detroit Free Press reported. He was fleeing Livonia police in the course of yet another  home invasion. 'It just baffles my mind that someone with that history was even allowed out,' Kristina Vitale told the Free Press. 'He's being tried for his fourth serious offense? Does it take a life...to keep someone behind bars?' Mother Angela Vitale sobbed as she remembered her baby girl. 'Why, why was he let out?' she wailed. 'They should be held responsible — whoever let him out should be held responsible,' she told the Free Press. McCallum had first been eligible for parole in September 2013 but was held longer because authorities thought he needed to complete a violence prevention program. Yet he was released just months later. The Michigan Department of Corrections says McCallum 'successfully completed the program with a very positive overall assessment. 'However, predicting human beings' future behavior can be a very difficult task,' department spokesman Russ Marlan told the Free Press. 'Unfortunately, some of the individuals they parole end up not being successful and some end up hurting innocent citizens. 'I know personally that these cases have a significant impact on the individual parole board members involved — they anguish deeply over these cases.' The happy couple poses for engagement pictures . Francesca and Matthew Weather had just found a new house to start their lives together when she was killed . The day of her accident, Francesca had been traveling for work as part of her job as a sales manager for tobacco company Altria. She had just married Matthew Weatherhead in June, and was  putting her husband through medical school at MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine. To her family, Francesca was the 'angelic one,' they told the Free Press. 'My sister was my whole world — she was my everything,' sister Nina Vitale told the Free Press. 'I just want justice.' The two met at Michigan State University, where Matthew Weatherhead was going to medical school . The family says they harbor no ill feelings against the police officer who was chasing McCallum when the accident the happened. The cop has been heartbroken over the crash and had to take a leave of absence, the family says. 'I want her to know we don't blame her,' mother Angela Vitale told the Free Press. 'She was doing her job.' Francesca graduated from Trenton High School, where she played softball and was named homecoming queen, according to The News Herald. She went on to attend Michigan State University and graduated in 2010 with a degree in business administration and marketing. Francesca and Matthew were married in June, just months before she was killed in the horrific crash .","Francesca Vitale Weatherhead, 25, had just started her new life with husband Matthew when she was tragically killed in a car crash .

"Dallas Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan had apologized to his fiancée after doctors told him he had the deadly disease and told her he would have rather died in Liberia than put her at risk, a family friend has said. 'He apologized to Louise the day they told him what he had. He told her, ""I’m so sorry all of this is happening. I would not put the love of my life in danger,'"" Saymendy Lloyd told the Washington Post. Mr Duncan passed away from the disease on Wednesday morning at Texas Presbyterian Hospital. He had been medically sedated and treated with an experimental antiviral drug prior to his death. Duncan's family said on Tuesday that he had no idea he had been exposed to Ebola when he boarded a plane in Liberia, bound for the United States. Scroll down for video . 'Love of his life': Thomas Eric Duncan (right) apologized to his fiancée Louise Troh (left) when he was diagnosed with Ebola, a family friend said. Mr Duncan passed away at a Dallas hospital on Wednesday . Karsiah Duncan (center), son of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, speaks about his dad's condition in Dallas on Tuesday. With him: Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (left rear) and Saymendy Lloyd (left), executive director of the Women's Wing Organization . Duncan had reportedly helped care for a pregnant woman who later died of the disease in Monrovia, Liberia. However, he had told those close to him that he thought she was suffering complications from the pregnancy and had no idea she was infected with Ebola. Duncan told Louise Troh, whom he came to the United States to marry, that he 'would have preferred to stay in Liberia and died than bring this disease to you,' Mr Lloyd told the Post. Liberia authorities accused Duncan of lying on an airport screening form before flying out of Monrovia last month and claiming he had no contact with Ebola victims. The Dallas County prosecutor also announced this week Duncan could face criminal charges if he knew he had Ebola and exposed people to the disease anyway. Ten people, including seven healthcare workers and three family members, are considered at high risk for Ebola after they were exposed to Duncan after he became contagious. Another 38 more are being monitors by the CDC for possible risk of the disease. Ebola spreads by having contact with the bodily fluids of an infected patient. Even getting sweat or blood on the skin can cause an infection. Duncan's fiance Louise Troh, who is perhaps highest at risk of catching the disease after she cared for him at her Dallas apartment while he sweated and vomited through the early staged of the disease, says she does not blame him for possibly exposing her. She had told WFAA-TV that she just wanted him to get better so that he can return to her. The couple, who met in a refugee camp in the Ivory Coast, have a 19-year-old son Karsiah together who is currently in college. 'I'm just praying to God that he gets better. He's a generous guy, and I'm just so sad. He just come to America and just get so sick, and just went down just in a second,' she told the TV station. 'I feel so sad. I'm confused, and really disturbed. I don't know. I'm just praying to God so he can wake up and for him to be able to see his children and be able to come back to his family.' Karsiah Duncan, a student at Angelo State University, arrived in Dallas on Tuesday to visit his father for the first time. 'I hope and keep praying that my family is OK — and that my dad makes it out safely,' Karsiah said. The college student spoke briefly and softly to reporters at Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas, which has a large Liberian community. 'Thank you church for all the good things you've been doing for my mom, the support given to my family,' Karsiah said. 'Thanks to the hospital for their work in trying to help my dad stay alive.' Karsiah's mother, Ms Troh, remains in quarantine after she had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan. Troh left Liberia more than a decade ago after a falling out with Duncan — but the two renewed their relationship earlier this year. Krasiah Duncan, 19, spoke to reporters for the first time on Tuesday regarding his dad's condition, after he was the first person diagnosed with the deadly Ebola virus . Mr Duncan's mother, Nowai Korkoya, traveled 15 hours to pray near the hospital where her son remains in isolation . Duncan's family visited him at the hospital on Tuesday but declined to view him via video because the last time it had been too upsetting. The relatives glimpsed him using a video system at Dallas' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Monday. But when they returned anew, this time with Reverend Jessie Jackson, they decided such images were too much. 'What we saw was very painful. It didn't look good,' said Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks. Weeks said he and Duncan's mother were unable to sleep after seeing Duncan's face. On Tuesday, the hospital said Duncan, who was in isolation since September 28, was in a critical condition and sedated but stable. He was on a breathing machine and kidney dialysis. His temperature was normal and his diarrhea has slowed. Duncan's liver function, which declined over the weekend, had improved,doctors said on Tuesday. Authorities in the United States and the public are on alert following Duncan's diagnosis more than a week ago, which raised concerns that the worst epidemic of Ebola on record could spread from three hardest-hit impoverished countries — Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Duncan, who arrived in Texas in late September on a commercial flight from Liberia, had been in a critical condition since Saturday. The first case of Ebola being contracted outside of West Africa was reported in Spain and the World Health Organization expects more cases in Europe. Freelance NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo is being treated at the Nebraska Medical Center, which cared for one other U.S. national flown out of West Africa after contracting Ebola and was later discharged.

Support: Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks, is comforted by the Rev. Jesse Jackson . The drug used in Dallas and Nebraska, brincidofovir, was developed by Durham, North Carolina-based Chimerix Inc. The company said it has been tested in more than 1,000 patients without raising safety concerns. 'We decided this was currently our best option for treatment,' said Phil Smith, medical director of the Nebraska Medical Center's Biocontainment Unit, which consulted with U.S. health and drug officials before making its decision. Mukpo is experiencing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, the center said. U.S. health officials said on Tuesday they would unveil within days new screening procedures at the country's airports to address public concern over the possibility of an outbreak. Texas state health officials said they are monitoring 10 people who had close contact with Duncan and 38 others who came into contact with that group to see if anyone had developed signs of infection. So far, no one has shown any symptoms, health officials said. Officials have said this is a critical week to see if any of those exposed in Dallas develop signs of the virus that has killed more than 3,400 people since an outbreak in West Africa began in March, out of nearly 7,500 confirmed, probable and suspected cases. Dallas residents have mostly taken in news of Ebola within the city limits calmly, but many have kept a close eye on whether it might spread. Cars of Dallas County Sheriff's deputies who were at the scene of the apartment where Duncan stayed have been scrubbed as a precaution, the sheriff's office said. Prominent civil rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson met members of Duncan's family and held a prayer vigil on Tuesday in front of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. Jackson said the hospital initially discharged Duncan because he was poor and did not have medical insurance. About two days after Duncan left the hospital, he was taken back by ambulance and put into isolation. The hospital and health officials have said mistakes were made in handling Mr Duncan.

"Tiago Rocha, 26, has confessed to killing 39 people, making him one of the world's most prolific killers . The serial killer always stuck to his system. Prostitutes were stabbed. Homeless men were shot. Gays he choked. And young women — the victims he came to savor killing the most — he would shoot in the chest. That was the modus operandi of Tiago Henrique Gomes da Rocha, the Brazilian serial killer who has confessed to murdering at least 39 people in just three years, making him of the most prolific killers in the world. Rocha, 26, was arrested Tuesday after being pulled over in the city of Goiania, when local police found he was facing trial for stealing a motorcycle's license plate in January. He was stopped while riding with fake plates on the motorcycle he often used during the murders, when he would drive by and attack random victims before speeding away. A day later, he confessed to killing 39 people — 15 young women as well as prostitutes and random people he thought to be gay or homeless. In a sick twist, it has been revealed that Rocha was in a romantic relationship with a pretty church girl with long hair, her appearance similar to that of his victims, the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reported. This is the moment confessed killer Tiago Rocha, 26, described his 20th murder to police . Lilian Mesquita, 28, was the 20th victim Rocha confessed to killing . Cops say he may have been engaged to the young woman, who would often take him to her Assembly of God church. Rocha began killing in 2011, at first targeting homeless people, gays and prostitutes. His first victim was a man, the first of 17 males he would eventually kill. This year, he turned his attention to young women. His first young female victim was 14-year-old Bárbara Costa, who had been waiting for her grandmother in a public square on January 18 when a man riding a motorcycle shot her in the chest and left without taking anything. The next day, 23-year-old Beatriz Moura was shot also by a man in a motorcycle. He once again didn't take anything. In all, he killed 15 women in seven months in Goiania, a city of 1.3 million people located some 200 miles from the country's capital of Brasilia. They were ages 14 to 29. Even as late as Sunday, he had once again tried to kill a woman — but the attempt was foiled when his gun didn't go off, and he ran away. Pictured here two of the victims, 24-year-old Janaina Souza (left ) and Barbara Costa, 14 . Victim Ana Maria Duarte, 26 . Victim Wanessa Felipe, 22 . In an interview with Folha, he said he was 'moved by a greater power' and regrets the crimes. 'I wanted to say that I am remorseful, that I wanted to have a chance to pay for what I've done — to ask for forgiveness,' he told Folha. Rocha spoke little, his eyes downcast. He paused frequently and gave short answers. He said he was feeling 'badly, very badly' about the killings. He wouldn't explain why he killed so many people, and avoided personal questions but to confirm that he had problems in his childhood. It was 'stronger than me,' he told Folha. 'I couldn't explain.' He was asked twice about the number of victims. The first time he refused to answer. The second, he said only: 'No comment.' He would often drink before the killings because it would give him liquid courage to proceed, Folha reported. While speaking to police, he would refer to his victims only as numbers. 'All the police officers who followed the interrogation were shocked by his coldness, not only with his modus operandi but also in the way he formulated his ideas,' interrogator Douglas Pedrosa, of the Goias Civil Police, told G1 news. 'He identified each victim by a number--number 30, number 12.' Pedrosa says the killer remembers details of each of his dozens of crimes. 'After admitting to a crime, he would stay there for some five minutes in a catatonic state,' Pedroso told G1. During those times, the killer told police, he would be thinking about the crime — reliving it, even. At times, he would have a smile on his face. 'After, he would give details about the place and what he was feeling,' Pedrosa told G1. 'He didn't have details of the faces, he had details of the violence.' Cops say he was 'cold' during questioning and was visibly bothered by female police staff. When women walked in he 'stopped talking, said he was bothered and that he wasn't going to talk anymore,' Pedrosa told G1.

Before pulling the trigger, he would always shout 'robbery', but then flee the scene without taking anything . Two of Rocha's victims. He confessed to killing 15 young women in the city of Goiania, where he lived . Rocha's lawyer, Thiago Vidal, told Folha that he counseled the killer of his right to remain silent. But Rocha pounded his fists on the interrogation table and insisted: 'No, I will talk.' 'I have to get this from inside me,' he said of the murders. Vidal at first said Rocha had confessed on Monday under pressure from police. Then on Wednesday, he was interrogated once again — and the defense lawyer left the room 'perplexed.' 'At first I thought the police may have coerced him into confessing to a crime he didn't commit, but he narrated with richness of detail each of the deaths,' the lawyer told Folha. While Rocha talked, the lawyer read through the police report detailing the confession from two days earlier. The killer made no mistakes in retelling his macabre story . 'He didn't hesitate,' Vidal told Folha. 'Everything fit.' The lawyer said Rocha attempted suicide with shards from a light bulb on Thursday. He is now on suicide watch in jail and remains handcuffed. He is expected to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Rocha was visited by his mother, an aunt and four other relatives on Friday after he asked for them. A hammer, knives and handcuffs were some of the items seized by the special police task force . Cops walk Rocha into the Goias Civil Police station after his arrest . If Rocha ends up being convicted of the crimes he confessed to, he will gain a place in the record books as one of the world's most prolific serial killers . Rocha's family described him to Folha as a quiet young man with few friends. He rarely went out to social events at night. He lived with his mother and a brother and never met his dad. He was molested by a neighbor when he was 11. Rocha graduated high school and worked for a couple of years in a private security firm. Police say he stole a .38-caliber gun from this job and used it in the murders. For the last four months, he's worked a night security shift in a large hospital in Goiania. Three victims: a special police task force arrested Rocha on Tuesday after the string of unexplained murders caused panic among the local population . Police say the assassin, who lived with his mother in the Goias state capital, has also confessed to killing transvestites and several homeless people, as well as women, two of whom are pictured here . Families and friends of the women murdered this year, including these two victims, staged a series of demonstrations to put pressure on the police and local government . Rocha say he killed because of the 'rage he felt against everything', which only subsided when he murdered. He was arrested on Tuesday by a special police task force set up to catch the serial killer after the string of unexplained murders caused panic among the local population. Families and friends of the women murdered this year staged a series of demonstrations to put pressure on the police and local government to solve the crime. They wore white and carried photos of the victims. Before pulling the trigger, Rocha would always shout 'robbery' —  but then flee the scene without taking anything. Officers swooped on Rocha when they discovered he was facing trial for stealing the number plate on a motorbike at a supermarket in Goiania in January. Days later he was was stopped by police riding a motorbike with a fake plate. The  murder weapon, a.38 revolver, was seized from the home he shared with his mother during a search along with a motorbike and stolen plates. Local reports said he told police before being taken to jail that he killed his victims to alleviate feelings of anxiety. Rocha shot his dead from a motorbike and shouted 'robbery' before pulling the trigger . The list of the 15 most prolific modern serial killers is topped by Colombian Luis Garavito, a child murderer and rapist known as 'La Bestia' or 'The Beast.' He is thought to have killed more than 400 people, mostly street children. His proven victim count is 138. Pedro Rodrigues Filho, Brazil's most prolific killer, claimed to have killed more than 100 victims, 47 of them inmates. He was convicted of killing 71 people. He killed his first two victims at the age of 14 and murdered his father and ate a piece of his heart.","Tiago Henrique Gomes da Rocha, 26, confessed to killing 39 people .

The drone's owner said he was using his remote-controlled device to survey construction work at a friend's house in Lower Township, on the Jersey Shore, on Friday afternoon. He was flying the camera-equipped helicopter around when he heard several blasts from nearby. Seconds later, the drone began to lose altitude and fell off the sky, NBC Philadelphia reported. Russell Percenti, 32, was arrested in New Jersey after he allegedly shot down with a shotgun a drone similar to the one pictured . The owner recovered the felled drone a few minutes later — plus a few holes from a shotgun.

"Jeida Torres, 3, died in Brooklyn after she was allegedly beaten by her mother's boyfriend . The uncle of a man accused of beating a toddler to death in a fit of rage is pleading with the public to know that he is 'not a monster.' 'When I heard about it I was shocked,' uncle Mark Almodovar told The Daily News. 'The kid, he's not that type of person. They said he was a monster - he's not a monster!' Cops found little Jeida Torres unconscious and unresponsive about 3:50pm Saturday in an apartment in Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood. Police had been called by a neighbor who heard the child screaming inside the place. Jeida had been allegedly 'punched and choked' by Almodovar's nephew, 20-year-old Kelsey Smith, who was babysitting her and her 5-year-old brother Andrew, sources told the Daily News. Almodovar says Smith only 'backslapped' the girl. 'Sometimes kids don't listen to their parents and they need to be disciplined. But the way he disciplined them was very wrong,' Almodovar said. Smith's cousin, Tina Torres, told reporters he did everything he could to save the child. 'He did call his mother crying, saying he just called 911, that she wasn't breathing,' Torres said. 'He called the cops before he left. I called my aunt (Smith's mother) and she was just trying to find his location. She asked him where he was and he refused and hung up on her. She was so upset.' Police found Jeida Torres, 3, unconscious and limp on Saturday night. She was rushed to Wyckoff Hospital but didn't survive . Mother Kimberly Torres (pictured) posted this picture of Jeida as a newborn on her Facebook after the toddler was killed . Smith has since attempted suicide.

"A Florida man will spend the rest of his life in prison for the 1994 murder of his wife — even though authorities never recovered her body from where it was dumped at sea off the Miami coast. Clifford Friend, 56, was convicted in July for the second-degree murder of Lynne Friend, 35, who vanished after winning a bitter child custody battle over their son Christian, then 5 years old. Friend was expected to receive just 22 years for the 20-year-old crime, but Judge Teresa Pooler handed down a much stiffer punishment, WSVN reported. 'The evidence shows, sir, that you . committed a monstrous act,' Judge Pooler told him in court Thursday, the station reported. 'Mrs. Friend's life was precious . and you took it from her. 'Then you dumped her body in the Atlantic . Ocean like she was a sack of trash.' Clifford Friend, 58, will spend the rest of his life in prison for the 1994 killing of his ex-wife Lynne . Victim: Lynne Friend, then 35, disappeared shortly after winning a bitter custody battle against Clifford Friend. Her body was never found . On the night she disappeared, Lynne . told her fiancé that Friend has called her to his Pembroke Pines home to pick up a child support check. Later that night, US Customers officers spotted Friend and pal Alan Gold racing out to sea on his 30-foot Chapparal boat. The officers saw the men throw something over the side of the boat before speeding off. Her body was never found, but Gold testified against Friend in exchange for immunity — telling jurors that Friend confided in him that he choked his wife. He also said the duo dumped her body, stuffed in a large duffel bag, at sea. In court Thursday, the victim's son — who was raised by Friend and his current wife Janet  — stood firmly by his father's side. 'I've been asked why I never questioned my dad about any of this many times by many people, and I never felt the need to,' said Christian Friend, now 25, according to WSVN. 'He raised me, and he taught me right from wrong and showed me what it means to be responsible and honest.' Right before she was killed, Lynne had planned to leave Florida and start a new life with fiance Ed O'Dell after winning primary custody of Christian. O'Dell was also in court on Thursday. In court Thursday, son Christian (right), now 25, said he didn't remember his slain mother and defended Friend (left), saying his convicted dad 'showed me what it means to be responsible and honest' 'I think he deserves the death penalty,' O’Dell said, according to the Miami Herald. 'I wish he could be hanged by the neck until pronounced dead.' He then turned to Christian Friend: 'She gave you life, she nourished you, she cared for you. She healed you when you were sick. Everything she did, she did for your benefit.' But Christian, who doesn't remember his mother, wasn't swayed. 'He is the best person I know,' he said of Friend, according to the Miami Herald. Prosecutor Michael Von Zamft told the Herald that he was satisfied with the sentence but it was 'disappointing and depressing' that the 25-year-old Christian couldn't  acknowledge that Friend 'cold-bloodedly killed his mother and took her out of his life.' 'I hope one day he understands what he has lost,' Judge Pooler said, according to the newspaper. An accomplice of Friend's said the duo used this boat to dump Lynne Friend's body off the coast of Miami . On the night of Lynne's disappearance in 1994, US Customs officers saw Friend throw something over the side of his boat at this spot near Miami .","Clifford Friend, 56, was sentenced in Miami for the 1994 murder of his ex-wife Lynn Friend, then 35 .

"A 14-year-old boy in San Francisco has been arrested as the suspect in the fatal stabbing of a former classmate who went on to attend a private high school on a football scholarship and had dreams of playing in the Ivy League. Because of his age, police have not named the teenager who killed 14-year-old Rashawn Williams on Tuesday outside a convenience store in the city's Mission District. Witnesses say Rashawn, a freshman at Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory, was buying chocolate at Rubin's Market with one of his younger brothers when he was attacked on his way out of the store about 7pm, NBC Bay Area reported. Two teenagers had been waiting for him outside. One of them, who relatives say had been threatening Rashawn over Facebook, stabbed the teen and fled.

His high school football coach, Ken Peralta, wrote on Facebook that he was a 'wonderful young man.' 'Seems that another young man had issues with him over social media issues and was threatening him,' Peralta wrote, according to the Chronicle. 'The two crossed paths and with his little brother in hand, Rashawn was knifed in the heart.' Rashawn had a perfect score throughout middle school and was recruited to play football on a scholarship at the private Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory.

'He was such a humble kid — he was so good-hearted,' aunt Maria MacMurray told the Chronicle. 'His dream was to go to Harvard. This is a tragedy.' MacMurray also told the paper that social media could have played a role in the stabbing. 'It's hard. I can't explain the pain when I found . out he didn't make it through surgery,' added Rashawn's cousin, 15-year-old Jamar Williams, to the Chronicle. 'I was just crying thinking about . all the great times we had together.' Dozens of friends and family members on Wednesday gathered to light candles and pray at the spot where Rashawn was stabbed.

"Kenneth Harden, 32, was arrested on rape and torture charges . An Indiana man forced his wife to sign a sex slave contract so he could sexually abuse and torture her — while he coerced her by controlling her diabetes medication, police charge. Kenneth Harden, 32, is accused of binding his wife with ropes, forcing her to wear a choke collar and raping her repeatedly. He is charged with 38 felonies ranging from strangulation, criminal confinement and domestic battery, WHAS11 reported. Some of the charges stem from incidents that happened while his two kids were nearby, according to WBIW. Authorities say Harden wrote out an elaborate contract defining himself as the 'master' and his wife as the 'slave.' His wife said she couldn't leave not only because she 'loved him' — but also because he controlled the medication she needed for her severe diabetes, according to WHAS11. Seymour police arrested him on Saturday while responding to a domestic call at the couple's home. When officers arrived, they found Harden on the sidewalk while his distraught wife sobbed inside the apartment, WBIW reported. While investigating the call, police found an 11-page manual outlining 'the slave's role' and 'punishments,'  which was signed by both Harden and his wife in June, according to the station. The victim, who is not named because she was a victim of sexual abuse, said Harden forced her to sign the contract or he would leave her. She told cops that he was 'sweet' and 'swept her off her feet' when they first met via Craigslist in July 2013, according to WBIW. But soon he told her was a sadist and wanted to be her master, the station reported. The woman said he at times tied her to her bed for so long, she would urinate on herself, according to WBIW. She would often lose her consciousness during the torture sessions, court records show.","Kenneth Harden, 32, is accused of binding his wife with ropes and torturing her repeatedly under a 'master' and 'slave' contract he made her sign .

"It has been five years since two Virginia Tech students were shot to death in the parking lot of a Virginia campground. But local detectives are no closer to finding out who was behind the Aug. 26, 2009, slaying of Heidi Childs and David Metzler at Caldwell Fields in the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests. Capt. Robert New on Tuesday said the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office still has no new information regarding the double shooting, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. Childs, 18, and Metzler, 19, had been together for at least four years and had just started their second year at Virginia Tech, where she was majoring in industrial and systems engineering while he studied biochemistry. Victims: Heidi Childs, 18, and David Metzler, 19, were fatally shot in 2009 in a Virginia campground. The case remains unsolved . A white cross marks the spot where the couple was slain at the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests . The night they were killed, the couple, both of Virginia, had planned on chatting and playing guitars while parked at the idyllic campground in Montgomery County. Childs told friends they wouldn't be late because she had homework to do. They left her apartment about 8 pm. Next morning, a man walking his dog found their bodies shot by a .30-30 rifle. He was inside his Toyota Camry. She was on the ground outside. Since then, investigators have remained unable to point to a motive, saying the shootings were likely random, according to the Times-Dispatch. On the third anniversary of the homicide in 2012, Sheriff Tommy Whitt revealed that his detectives had found DNA evidence at the scene and were trying to match it to people who frequent the area. He said his department was still actively working the case. Childs and Metzler had been a couple for four years and wanted to attend Virginia Tech together. They were starting their second year there when they were killed . Every year since their killing, friends and family members have continued to drop by to set memorials at the spot where Childs and Metzler died . Back then, Whitt told WSET that he'd called the original lead investigator in the case out of retirement so he would focus finding the killer. Detectives said the shooter took Childs' purse containing her cell phone, camera, Virginia Tech lanyard, ID and credit card. The items are still missing. A $70,000 reward remains in place for any information related to the shootings. Police in 2009 canvas the area in Virginia where the Virginia Tech couple was killed .

"Low-income residents in a California city will soon be able to get high for free. The Berkeley City Council has passed a law requiring medical marijuana dispensaries to distribute 2 percent of their stashes to people making less than $32,000 per year or $46,000 per family. Under the new ordinance, which was approved unanimously this summer, only city residents will be eligible and they must have a prescription. 'Basically, the city council wants to make sure that low-income, homeless, indigent folks have access to their medical marijuana, their medicine,” Councilman Darryl Moore told CBS San Francisco. Low-income residents of Berkeley, California, will soon be eligible for free marijuana at dispensaries such as the Berkeley Patients Group (pictured) The law requires that the free medical marijuana, which is legal in California, 'be the same quality on average as medical cannabis that is dispensed to other members,' according to Berkeleyside. Mayor Tom Bates says the move is an effort to provide equal access to what California law considers medication. 'There are some truly compassionate cases . that need to have medical marijuana — but it's expensive,' Bates told the New York Times. 'You hear stories about people dying from cancer who don’t . have the money.' Critics of the program are furious. 'It’s . ludicrous, over-the-top madness,' Bishop Ron Allen, a former addict who . runs the International Faith Based Coalition, told Fox News. 'Why would Berkeley City Council want to keep their . poverty-stricken under-served high, in poverty and lethargic?' 'Instead of taking steps to help the most economically vulnerable residents get out of that state, the city has said, ""Let’s just get everybody high,""' lobbyist John Lovell, of the California Narcotic Officers’ Association, told the Times. Dispensary owners say the ordinance only formalizes the common practice of distributing 'compassion' — the name given to free medical marijuana. 'We do this on our own, so we certainly . welcome the city mandating that all dispensaries create these sorts of . programs,' Sean Luse, who runs the Berkeley Patients Group , told . Berkeleyside. But they're weary of the 2 percent mandate. 'I do think there could be problems if we’re oversupplying demand and giving away more cannabis than is legitimately needed. We’ll see how this plays out.' Berkeley's free marijuana ordinance will go into effect next August.","Berkeley residents with a prescription and annual income of less than $32,000 will be eligible for free pot .

"An 18-year-old Kansas man with a history of mental issues has died after police fired several rounds at him outside a hardware store in Ottowa. Family members say that Joseph Jennings, 18, had just been released from Ransom Memorial Hospital on Saturday night after he attempted suicide by swallowing some 60 pills. Ottowa police were called to the parking lot of Orscheln Farm and Home for a report of a man with a gun — and found Jennings in a 'suicidal state,'  his family said. The officers confronted Jennings and eventually shot him '16 times,' a relative told KCTV. He was rushed to an Ottowa hospital but later died of his injuries.

They said to get back or they were going to shoot him.' But by then it was too late. Smith told The Star that her nephew made gestures that looked like he was reaching for a gun — and the shooting began. 'They didn’t have to shoot and kill him,' the aunt told The Star. 'Nobody deserves this.' At least one of the officers involved in the shooting had transported Jennings to the hospital during Jennings' suicide attempt, she said. 'They knew him — they dealt with him the day before,' Smith told the Kansas City Star. She added, 'I was screaming at the top my lungs: ‘That’s Joseph Jennings!

'We . mourn the loss of any life,' he told reporters, according to The Star. 'We extend our heartfelt condolences and . compassion to the family of Mr. Jennings.' 'We are thankful that no police officers or sheriff’s . deputies were injured while defending themselves from the potential . threat of serious bodily harm.' Jennings had been struggling recently and, minutes before his suicide attempt, he wrote an anguished message on Facebook. 'Tonight is the night goodbye everyone!!!!!' he wrote before swallowing as many as 60 pills, hoping to overdose. Brandy Smith told reporters her nephew was 'suicidal' and she pleaded with cops to not shoot him in the seconds before he was blasted some 16 times . 'It was truly a good ride!

"A pit-bull has died after being repeatedly stabbed during a pet adoption event in Georgia, where the dog bit a smaller pooch inside a PetSmart store while dozens of horrified adults and children watched. Witnesses say 3-year-old pit-bull Clara somehow got off its leash — charging and biting a small Westie Terrier at the Newnan PetSmart on Sunday, the Newnan Times-Herald reported. The terrier's owner, Craig Emory Hayes, told police the pit-bull grabbed his dog Lexie by its ear and began to pull it while Hayes yelled for someone to help, CBS46 reported. He at first punched the dog, according to the police report. Once Clara wouldn't let go, he pulled out a pocket knife and began to stab the dog, the Times-Herald reported. The newspaper reported that Hayes yelled 'f***ing pit-bull!' while he stabbed the dog repeatedly. Clara later had to be euthanized due to her stab wounds. Pit-bull Clara, 3, has been euthanized after a dog owner in Georgia stabbed her repeatedly when the pit-bull bit his Westie Terrier, Lexie . West Terrier Lexie (left) suffered minor injuries and is expected to recover in two weeks. Clara (right) was euthanized after being rushed to a veterinarian . 'It is the worst thing I've ever seen,' eyewitness Teresa Reeves, told WXIA-TV. 'We heard screaming at the front of the store and went running to see what was happening,' added Reeves, who was at the store with her fiance and 10-year-old daughter. 'The pit bull had the smaller dog at the back of the neck holding the loose skin and fur there.' There were at least three dozen people at the store during the incident, many of them children. 'The pit bull came charging past me and . my family and straight towards this small dog who was on a leash,' wrote eyewitness Kathy Stottlar, who said she was standing a foot from the incident, on Facebook. 'His . owner was checking him in or out at the vet hospital. The pit was not on . a leash. Don’t know if he broke his leash or whoever had him lost his . grip or what. It was terrifying.' Both dogs were taken to a local vet. The Westie Terrier Lexie suffered minor injuries. 'After 3 hours at emergency clinic, . sweet Lexie had to stay overnight, the wounds in her neck are building . up fluid, her ear is tore up, and her eye has an hematoma and ripped up . her forehead, looks terrible with blood building up in eye!' wrote owner Tracie Hayes on Facebook. 'Lots of . antibiotics, shots and rest, will be better in about two weeks, said the . vet. Craig said she was crying like crazy when he left. Poor baby.' The Newnan-Coweta Humane Society set up a Facebook page to spread the word about the adoption efforts for Clara . A Facebook page for Clara shows her as a playful and loyal dog who liked to roll on the grass and run around . Reeves' fiance, Mike Wohler, told the Times-Herald that Craig Hayes should be prosecuted. 'He straight murdered this dog in front of 30, 40 people,' he told the paper. 'He didn’t like pit bulls. This just gave him the excuse he needed.' No arrests have been made. In its adoption page for Clara, the Newnan-Coweta Humane Society says the pit-bull 'can be particular of other animal companions.' The description has since been removed. A Facebook page asking for 'Justice for Clara' had garnered more than 5,700 followers by early afternoon on Tuesday, with hundreds of people adding their support each hour.","Craig Emory Hayes, of Georgia, was at a PetSmart store when his Westie Terrier Lexie was bitten by 3-year-old pit-bull Clara .

"A disabled Iraq War veteran says he was turned away from Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey for wearing a shit in support of his fellow Marines — all because it contained the image of a rifle in front. Mario Alejandro says Six Flags turned his family away from the park because of this shirt . Mario Alejandro, 33, says he was with his wife and three children en route to a birthday party at the Jackson Township park on Saturday when a security guard grabbed his arm. ‘I can’t let you into the park with that shirt on,' the guard told him, according to NJ.com. 'That shirt’s offensive.’ Alejandro, who was part of the initial invasion of Iraq in 2003, was aghast. The t-shirt — which says 'Keep Calm and Return Fire' accompanied by a drawing of a red, white and blue rifle — was a Father's Day gift from his wife and kids, purchased from The Reconnaissance Foundation, a nonprofit that supports veterans and their families. 'I said that it’s . not offensive — it’s a military shirt,' Alejandro told NJ.com. 'I told him that I am an Iraq . veteran, I served in the war. 'But he said: 'I don’t care, you have to . take that off — or you need to buy another shirt to put over it.'' Alejandro, who was left disabled after two tours of duty in Iraq as a Marine, says his young son started crying. 'I just told my son to remember this day, to remember how they treat veterans,"" he told NJ.com .

It was purchased at a fundraisers in support of his fellow Marines, some pictured here during the initial invasion of Iraq in 2003 . Six Flags spokeswoman Kristin Siebeneicher told NJ.com that the incident remains under review. The park does not allow clothing with 'vulgar, offensive or violent language or images,' she said. 'If a guest is wearing such attire, we ask them to remove and replace it with another item of clothing,' she wrote in a statement. 'And if they do not have one, they are able to purchase a replacement item at a gift shop.'But Alejandro says he doesn't see anything wrong with his shirt. 'They’re military and they’re . patriotic — that’s my thing,' he told NJ.com. 'I wore them to all over the . place, to my kids’ baseball games – everywhere. 'And I got nothing but . compliments about how great they were,' he added. 'No one ever said they were . offensive, because it’s obvious that they’re in support of the military . and the United States.' Alejandro now wants an apology from the park — or at the very least a policy review. 'I fought for this country, I laid in a hole for 36 hours with no sleep, and had friends die for this country and so the people here could have the freedom to things like visit amusement parks,' he told NJ.com. 'So when they told me that I couldn't come in there with my family because of my shirt, a patriotic shirt, it hurt a lot. 'No other veteran should ever have to experience that.'

"It was this close. Tragedy almost struck at the Washington Nationals game on Sunday, as a little girl ran in front of the pitching mound and was almost hit by Stephen Strasburg. The hard-throwing pitcher was warming up before the San Francisco Giants game when a a tiny blonde child in Nationals gear dashed across the field right in front of where he was about to throw. It was a narrow call — but Strasburg stopped himself at the last second and let the girl pass. The Nationals pitcher averaged 97 mph per pitch in the 2012 season, according to Sports Illustrated.

"A Florida mother is furious at a police dispatcher who would not send officers to help when her baby son was trapped inside her sweltering car. Shana Dees was running errands on Saturday with her 10-month-old son Jack. It was about noon when they left a CVS pharmacy in New Tampa and and Dees moved Jack from the shopping cart to his car seat. The cart began to move away because of the parking lot's uneven ground. Dees ran over to secure the cart — but turned back to a frightening scene. 'Those three seconds, when I was moving the cart, he hit the lock button,' Dees told WFTS. Emergency: Shana Dees says a 911 operator refused to send help when her son was locked inside her car . Trapped: 10-month-old baby Jack (right) hit the lock button inside his mom's SUV and was trapped inside in a hot Florida afternoon . The car wasn't running and the heat was soaring, hitting a maximum of 96 degrees. Also locked inside: Dees' cell phone and purse. 'I was just sitting there, watching him get hotter and turn redder — and he was soaked with sweat, Dees told WFTS. She begged a stranger to let her call 911 with his cell phone. 'My infant son is locked in the car in the parking lot,' Dees told the dispatcher, WFTS reported. 'It is so hot outside. I'm really concerned, like I don't think I have time to call AAA before he would suffer heat exhaustion. Can somebody come out and open the door? I don't even know if that is something you guys do.' The dispatcher responded: 'They won't be able to try to gain access [to the] car unless the child is in some kind of distress and, well, by that point they may just smash your windows.' The call went silent. Some eight minutes later, an off-duty officer saw Dees' desperation and called 911 himself. 'Where are they at?' the second dispatcher said. 'We will be out there for her.' Before the officers arrived, another CVS customer grabbed a wrench inside the store and broke one of the car's windows — rescuing baby Jack and handing him over to his mother. Jack was trapped inside the car until a Good Samaritan smashed one of the windows with a wrench . Dees and baby Jack were at this CVS Pharmacy in New Tampa when the toddler locked himself inside the car . The Tampa Police Department has launched an investigation into the incident and the dispatcher, who 'absolutely make a mistake,' will likely be disciplined, spokeswoman Laura McElroy told WFTS. 'The dispatcher should've kept the mother on the line, should've found out where she was and then immediately dispatched both a police officer and fire rescue,' McElroy told the station. Dees is thankful to the people who helped her get Jack out of the car. 'I would like to say thank you to them, to the man who let me use his phone to the officer that was able to get the police out there,' she told WFTS.

"This 13-year-old kid may be a Little League player, but there is nothing diminutive about him. Erick Figueroa, who plays for Puerto Rico, stands at an insane 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 240 pounds.

At 6-foot-4, Erick Figueroa stands like a giant next to some of the other average-sized players . Erick Figueroa, 230 pounds, is about the same size as Boston Red Sox hitter David Ortiz, whose size earned him the nickname 'Big Papi' One of Figueroa's main attributes is his 'intimidating mound presence,' according to Baseball Factory's scouting report.

"A Florida mom left her two young boys alone at home for hours, tying one to a sliding door with two belts and leaving both in diapers overflowing with their own filth, police charge. Derek Riley, a driver for the furniture store Rent-a-Center, told cops that he was visiting a customer in Orlando on Tuesday when he noticed two little boys, about 2 and 5, playing by themselves in a fenced-in backyard. He noticed something stranger about the older of the boys: two belts tied his left ankle up to a sliding glass door. 'They had him like an animal in there,' Riley told WFTV. 'That was really shocking to me.' 'You know how you would tie your dog to a tree outside?' he added. 'It was like that circumstance a little bit.' Cops in Orlando say that a mother left her 5-year-old boy tied to this sliding door by his ankle using two leather belts. He was left alone with his brother, about 2, and both were in overflowing diapers when they were rescued . Charged: The mother of the boys, 24-year-old Neftaldry Escarment, was arrested on a child neglect charge . Ryan knocked on the front door but nobody answered. He called the Orange County Sheriff's Office, whose deputies barged into the front door and found the children by themselves. The boys reeked of urine, and both were wearing diapers that appeared to not have been changed in some time. The 5-year-old boy, who was tied to the door, had a raw ankle that indicated he was routinely left like this for hours at a time. He could not reach the bathroom, food or water from where he was. Deputies say the house looked like a nightmare: there were sharp pieces of metal and full trash bags in the backyard where the children played, as well as greasy pans and unsecured chemicals easily reachable inside the apartment. The mother — Neftaldry Escarment, 24, of Haiti — arrived while deputies were in the house and told them she was at work. Investigators checked in with her supposed employer and found out she hadn't worked there for months. Escarment told authorities that the father, whose name has not been released, was at work at the time and she had no way of reaching him. She was charged with child neglect and remains at Orange County Jail on $1,000 bond. The children have been placed in the care of protective services.

"The Brooklyn father who fatally beat 7-year-old Nixzmary Brown also forced his son to rape a relative, according to reports. The new allegations were laid out on Wednesday against Cesar Rodriguez, who was convicted in the 2006 torture and killing of Nixzmary, in a case that shocked New York and forced a major shake up of the city's child protection agency. Rodriguez's now 15-year-old stepson, who has been charged with raping two relatives some eight years ago, told detectives that his stepfather forced him to commit at least one of the crimes, the New York Daily News reported. The father made the boy commit the act while he watched, sources told the New York Post. The alleged rape would have happened before his sister's murder in 2006, when he was about 8 years old. Victim: Nixzmary Brown, then 7, was fatally beaten by her father after he accused her of eating his yogurt. Her mother, who had often abused the child herself, did nothing while Nixzmary was killed in 2006 . MURDER: Nixzmary Brown's parents, Cesar Rodriguez and Nixzaliz Santiago, are both serving prison sentences for bounding and beating the 7-year-old girl. The mother did nothing while Rodriguez dealt the final blow . The teen, who now lives with an adoptive family in the Bronx, is charged with rape and endangering the welfare of a minor, The Post reported. Police say that the boy and Nixzmary lived in a house of horrors in Brooklyn and were subjected to starvation and frequent beatings, often involving a thick leather belt. She was also bound frequently and left in a rat-infested room where she was forced to use the cat litter as a toilet. Nixzmary's murder led to reforms at the Administration for Children's Services when it was revealed that case workers had received reports of abuse before but did nothing to stop the girl's parents . The day of her brutal murder in 2006, Rodriguez became enraged because the child had eaten one of his yogurts. The mother, Nixzaliz Santiago, had been a frequent witness to the beatings and often partook in dealing blows, but did nothing to stop Rodriguez as he savagely beat the 7-year-old girl. They were both charged with manslaughter and convicted of in her death. Rodriguez, who dealt the deathly blow, was sentenced to 29 years in prison. The mother, who had previously been convicted of beating the child, was sentenced to a stiffer sentence that could keep her behind bars for up to 43 years. Nixzmary's death shocked the nation and led to an overhaul of the city's Administration for Children's Service.

"With her unique look and seemingly endless supply of energy, she has been the star of fashion week for the past few seasons. But it seems that Cara Delevingne's love affair with the catwalk is coming to an end. Hinting at the fact that success can take its toll, Cara, who walked in around 50 shows for the autumn/winter shows in February earlier this year, has branded fashion week 'horrible'. Despite walking in around 50 shows last season, Cara Delevingne has branded fashion week 'horrible' In an interview with Industrie magazine about the start of fashion week, the model confessed: 'Fashion Week is horrible.' However, she quickly explained: 'I mean it isn't horrible really, it's amazing. But having to work that much every day is. 'What I find hard is having to deal with all the people and all the c**p. It's when the press and fans are following me most, and it's when I work the hardest, so it's kind of like, f***.' Last month Cara Delevingne hinted she may quit the fashion industry because her psoriasis worsens when she is stressed. The 21-year-old told how Kate Moss encouraged her to seek medical advice after spotting her condition at Paris Fashion Week in March. Cara joined best friend Georgia May Jagger to walk in Marc Jacobs' show last night in New York . The stress-induced skin condition, which causes unsightly red sores, had flared up while they were working together. Cara . said: ‘It only happened during the Fashion Weeks, which are, of course, . the worst time of year for me to be covered in scabs. Psoriasis is an . auto-immune disease, and I’m sensitive. 'Kate Moss saw me before the Louis Vuitton show at 3am when I was being painted by people to cover the scabs. ‘She said, “This is horrible! Why is this happening? I need to help you”. She got me a doctor that afternoon.’ Onlookers . had already noticed the sores at a Versace show at Milan Fashion Week . in February, but assumed they were bruises. After the show, Miss . Delevingne tweeted: ‘Be gone psoriasis, you’re no fun.’ Those bushy brows and razor-sharp cheekbones were the stars of last season, but will Cara return to the catwalk? The . model now has career plans that will be kinder to her skin. She said: . ‘I want to make music, I want to act and I want to sing. I want to do . something that doesn’t make my skin erupt.’ Despite her conflicting views on fashion week, Cara was the star attraction on the . Marc Jacobs catwalk in New York last night. Despite a rather unflattering cropped blonde wig . covering her long locks, ever the professional she carried the bizarre look off with aplomb as she walked . the grassy runway for the flamboyant designer. And . with London Fashion Week kicking off in the capital today, it is yet to . be revealed whether the model-of-the-moment will be walking in any . shows.

Toned muscles filter out the stress chemical kynurenine and stop it from reaching the brain, preventing depression, Swedish researchers found . The Swedish researchers put two group of mice under stress by exposing them to loud bangs and flashing lights and waking them up at odd times. After five weeks of this, the normal mice showed signs of depression, including loss of appetite. However, the second group of GM mice remained healthy. These mice had genes that meant they were muscly, even without exercising. Further tests showed what is magical about muscle. Muscly mice make more of protective proteins called KATs. These stop a stress chemical called kynurenine from travelling to the brain. The researchers from Stockholm’s Karolinska Institute showed that normal mice quickly become depressed when given kynurenine. But muscly mice were immune to the chemical. In fact, the amount of kynurenine in their blood never rose because the KAT enzymes in their bulging muscles quickly neutralised it. Other experiments showed that normal mice made more of the protective KATs after regularly running on their wheel. Importantly, people also made more KATs after just a few weeks of exercise. Researcher Jorge Ruas said that by detoxifying the blood, muscle protects the brain said: ‘Well-trained muscle produces an enzyme that purges the body of harmful substances. Experts said the findings pave the way for better treatments for depression, as drugs that work on the muscles rather than the brain  should have fewer side effects . ‘The muscle’s function is reminiscent of the kidney or liver.’ Writing in the journal Cell, Dr Ruas said the discovery paves the way for new and better treatments for depression, which affects up to one in five Britons as some point in their life. Drugs that that works on the muscles, rather than the brain, should produce fewer side-effects. Dr Ruas said: ‘Depression is a debilitating condition with a profound impact on quality of life for millions of people worldwide. ‘Depression is one the world’s leading causes of disease burden and time lived with disability and current anti-depressant treatments are insufficient. ‘Our work suggests that there is great therapeutic potential…in harnessing one of the many beneficial effects of exercise.’","Well-honed muscles make more of protective proteins called KATs .

"Miami Dolphins player Derrick Shelby has been arrested for allegedly trespassing and resisting arrest without violence following a disturbance at a Fort Lauderdale nightclub. The defensive end allegedly caused a disturbance about 2am on Saturday and was asked by security guards to leave Cyn Nightclub, also called Off the Hookah. When he refused, police were called and he was arrested, the Miami Herald reported. Shelby, 25, has been released on bond and plans to enter a not guilty plea in court on Monday , defense attorney Danny Rosenberg told the Herald. 'Derrick maintains his innocence,' Rosenberg told the newspaper. Miami Dolphins defenseive end Derrick Shelby, 25, was arrested at a Fort Lauderdale club on Saturday. His attorney, Danny Rosenberg, says 'the only place the bruising can come from is from the police' In his booking mugshot, his lips and face are covered in blood — his left eye and lips badly swollen. Rosenberg told the Herald that the picture 'speaks volumes' given Shelby's charge of resisting arrest without violence. 'There was no report of a fight (in the club) or anything like that,' Rosenberg told the Palm Beach Post. 'The only place the bruising can come from is from the police. 'I don’t want to get into that too much. When you see charges of resisting without violence and you see photos like that there’s a lot of conflicting information.' Shelby is playing his third season with the Dolphins. He was undrafted out of Utah in 2012 and has appeared in all four of Miami's games this season, recording six tackles, two sacks and recovering a fumble. 'We are aware of the reports regarding Derrick Shelby and are in the process of gathering information,' the Dolphins said in a statement. Shelby is expected for practice Monday morning. The Dolphins have not yet said whether they will discipline the defensive end. Police say Shelby refused to leave Cyn Nightlub (pictured) in Fort Lauderdale and was forced out by officers .","Derrick Shelby, 25, was taken into custody on charges of trespassing and resisting arrest without violence at Cyn Nightclub in Fort Lauderdale .

"Ride-hailing app Uber is yet again being accused of deploying a dirty guerrilla war to control the car-on-demand market, using dozens of staffers to book and cancel rides with competing service Lyft to tie up the company's servers. Lyft — whose drivers sport iconic pink mustaches on their cars — claims that as many as 177 Uber employees have booked 5,560 rides through its app since October, CNN Money reported. Then, once a driver would approach the pick-up spot, the ride would be mysteriously canceled. Lyft says that the bait and switch creates a backlog in its system, making it seem that cars are booked up and the service is slower than its competitors. It also causes its drivers to waste time and money on gas for bogus rides. Shady: Car-hailing service Lyft, which is known for its iconic pink mustaches, says its main competitor, Uber, is employing shady tactics to keep control of the car-on-demand market . One rider alone canceled some 300 rides between May 26 and June 10, according to data released by the company. The user had a total of 21 accounts that combined canceled a whopping 1,524 rides. Another user had 14 accounts and nearly 700 cancellations. 'It's unfortunate for . affected community members that they have used these tactics, as it . wastes a driver's time and impacts the next passenger waiting for that . driver,' Lyft spokeswoman Erin Simpson told CNN Money. Lyft say that in the few occasions when these rides were completed, they were often short and served only as a recruitment pitch to lure its drivers over to Uber. Yet Uber, which has been accused of similarly shady tactics before, claim it is not so. In a rebuttal on Tuesday, the company said Lyft's claims are 'baseless and simply untrue.' 'Furthermore Lyft’s own drivers and employees, including one of Lyft’s founders, have canceled 12,900 trips on Uber,' the company said in a statement to TechCrunch. 'But instead of providing the long list of questionable tactics that Lyft has used over the years, we are focusing on building and maintaining the best platform for both consumers and drivers.' Guerrilla wars: Uber is accused of once again of booking services with competitors and canceling right away, slowing down the company's competition . This is not the first time Uber is accused of shaking down the competition. In January, the CEO of a similar car-hailing app, Gett, accused a least a dozen Uber employees of ordering more than 100 rides over the span of three days and then canceling them right before pick-up, TechCrunch reported. Then a few days later, CEO Jing Herman charged, Uber would contact Gett drivers and offer them money to switch over. Gett, which launched in New York in 2013, was supposed to be a more affordable option to the city's black car offerings. Some drivers say that Uber employees often book short trips just to try to convince them to switch over from Lyft . Uber spokesman Andrew Noyes admitted to TechCrunch that its 'local teams can be pretty determined when spreading the word about Uber and how our platform opens up new economic opportunities for drivers.' 'It was likely too aggressive a sales tactic and we regret the team’s approach to outreach of these drivers,' Uber said in a statement to the tech website. But the company denied that its cancellations had caused any delays of loss of business for Gett, and insisted it had paid cancellation fees for all the rides. Earlier this month, several Uber drivers told CNN Money that the company warned its drivers they were 'forbidden' to work for Lyft, even invoking a non-existent rule by New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission as an explanation. A spokesman for the commission said there are no rules proscribing affiliation with both companies.","Lyft claims that 177 Uber employees booked 5,560 rides through its app .

"Viewers tuned in to KTVA-TV's 10pm newscast last night were given a bit of a shock when the newsreader revealed the identity of the owner of a medical marijuana business  - herself. Reporter Charlo Greene made the confession live on air before announcing that she was quitting using just a few choice words. 'And as for this job, well, not that I have a choice but, f*** it, I quit,' she said. Ms Greene had reported on the Alaska Cannabis Club during Sunday night's broadcast, without revealing her connection to it, Alaska Dispatch News reported. Scroll down for video . Reporter Charlo Greene made the confession live on air before announcing that she was quitting . But at the end of the report, during a live shot, she announced that she was the club's owner and would be devoting herself to legalizing the drug in Alaska. She said: 'Now everything you heard is why I, the actual owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club, will be dedicating all of my energy for fighting for freedom and fairness which begins with legalizing marijuana here in Alaska.' Ms Greene then announced she was quitting and marched off camera. Back in the main studio, the anchor looked rather flummoxed as she struggled to decide how to proceed, before glancing up and down, offering an quick apology, and saying: 'We'll be right back.' The news channel took to Twitter to apologise. 'Viewers, we sincerely apologize for the inappropriate language used by a KTVA reporter on the air tonight,' it wrote. 'The employee has been terminated.' The Alaska Cannabis Club connects medical marijuana cardholders with other cardholders who are growing cannabis. On its website, the club bills itself as striking 'a perfect balancing act with Alaska's Medical Marijuana laws'. Growers are offered 'donations' as reimbursement for the costs of growing the plant, the club said in an interview with Alaska Dispatch News in August. The club said it hopes to increase access to medical marijuana patients, despite operating in a legal grey area within Alaska's murky medical marijuana laws. Fan: On an image on her Facebook page, Greene can be seen giving marijuana plants the thumbs up . No holding back: While on a trip to Colorado, she poses with a joint and marijuana in another Facebook image .

"Dave Hockey and Shawna Bigelow have spent £20,000 on sex dolls to spice up their love life. The couple, who have been dating for over a year, regularly share their bed with five silicone dolls. Dave has been a collector of the dolls for years after first buying one for a documentary in 2010. The hobby previously had a detrimental effect on his love life, with women he met cutting off contact after they discovered his passion. Dave Hockey (left) and his partner Shawna Bigelow (right) with their sex doll Bianca. The couple have four more sex dolls, including one male that they regularly use during sex sessions . Shawna is the first woman he has met through online dating sites who embraced his fetish. He said: 'I had been on a dating site and I had a few good candidates, but I had someone that dumped me immediately when they did a search for me on the internet and saw the documentary. 'I thought what do I have to lose and on our first date it was my dad's birthday. 'I stopped by gave my dad a card and took (Shawna) to the basement and showed her these things. 'I thought, if she leaves me then that will whittle down the choices.' Fortunately for Dave, Shawna took to the idea immediately. She told This Morning: 'I was actually shocked, I knew what the dolls looked like before because I had watched it on TV, but I was interested because they are like big barbie dolls. Dave and Shawna in bed with their sex doll Bianca. The couple enjoy using dolls in the bedroom because it is safer than having threesomes with real people . Shawna (right) admits that she does sometimes get jealous of Dave (left) lavishing affection on his sex dolls, including Bianca (centre) 'So I started taking the wigs off and putting them on me. 'I was looking down their shirts and wanting to see everything  and he (Dave) was looking at me like ?!' The couple now regularly include one of Dave's four female dolls while they are having sex and Shawna claims the addition to the bedroom was actually her idea. She admitted that although she gets jealous of the attention her partner gives to his dolls, it is easily overcome. She said: 'It is kind of like a threesome without anyone getting hurt. 'You've got to realise that she is only a doll. that's really not real, because who has the perfect body? Dave added: 'Having a threesome with a doll is safer, there is no emotional entanglement.'

"Formula One's World Championship leader Nico Rosberg has been forced to ditch his limited edition helmet designed to celebrate Germany's World Cup triumph. Rosberg planned to wear the lid, emblazoned with the Germany flag, World Cup trophy, and four stars to celebrate each of his nation's World Cup wins following their 1-0 win over Argentina at this weekend's German Grand Prix. But the 29-year-old, who leads Lewis Hamilton in the World Championship by four points, is not allowed to carry an image of the World Cup after football's governing body FIFA expressed their grievances over issues with the copyright. New look: Nico Rosberg's helmet has been updated after he was forced to ditch an image of the famous trophy . Change: Rosberg won't be allowed to carry an image of the World Cup on his helmet for this weekend's race . Flying the flag: Rosberg celebrates Germany's World Cup triumph over Argentina on Sunday . 'We appreciate Nico Rosberg's desire to . congratulate the German team and have therefore been in discussions with . the Rosberg team to attempt to find a solution, whereby he is still . able to show his support for Germany without using FIFA intellectual . property in a commercial context,' a FIFA spokesperson said. The German's helmet has since been re-designed, carrying four stars to mark Germany's World Cup triumphs in 1954,1974, 1990 and 2014 instead. 'It is a shame,' said Robserg. 'I would have loved to carry the trophy as a tribute to the guys, but of course I respect the legal situation.' His Mercedes team also paid tribute to the World Cup winners with a message for Joachim Low's triumphant side on their motorhome at this weekend's race. Not since the International Olympic Committee banned British cake decorators from making rings out of marzipan have sporting officials been such party-poopers. FIFA have ordered Formula One World Championship leader Nico Rosberg to remove an image of the World Cup trophy from his helmet. Rosberg tweeted earlier in the week that he was planning to wear the design at this  weekend’s Grand Prix at Hockenheim in homage to the victory of the German football team. A piece of harmless fun? Not for FIFA. Their spokesman confirmed: ‘FIFA is obliged to take action against any unauthorised reproduction of its intellectual property in a commercial context. We cannot allow a commercially branded helmet to feature the FIFA World Cup trophy as this would jeopardise the rights of our commercial affiliates.’ This rebuke prompted Rosberg into a swift redesign. Winners: Mercedes marked the occasion with a special message on the side of their paddock motorhome . Rosberg arrives at this weekend's race in Hockeheim hoping to bounce back from his first DNF of the season at the British Grand Prix. Hamilton won in front of his home crowd at Silverstone to blow the title race wide open after Rosberg retried with a gearbox problem. 'Unfortunately my gearbox broke during the race and Lewis went on to win,' Rosberg wrote in his column for MailOnline. 'Naturally, there was then a lot of . interest in whether I would have won the race had I not suffered my . first DNF of the season. Eyes on the prize: The German leads the World Championship by four points from Lewis Hamilton . 'It is impossible to say, but let us give the benefit to the guy who was leading. I was doing well at the time, so I was pretty confident I could have made it happen and stayed out in front.' Rosberg married his long-term girlfriend Vivian Sibold at a ceremony in Monaco last week before putting pen to paper on a new deal with Mercedes on Wednesday. 'This is the place where I want to be. I feel very much at home here, and they have shown a lot of faith and respect in me and it is a great collaboration, so I am looking forward to many more successful years with the team,' he added. 'I am also enjoying the moment, because is special knowing that if I do a good job at each race I can be on pole and if I do a good job on Sunday I will win the grand prix. It doesn't get better than that.' VIDEO Rosberg signs Mercedes extension .","F1's World Championship leader not allowed to carry image of World Cup .

"It could be the ultimate in male vanity - men are paying thousands of pounds in search of the perfect nipple. Plastic surgeons are creating smaller, flatter nipples for male patients. Some men have their nipples made smaller during surgery to tidy up loose skin left after extreme weight loss. Others are have it done while having their 'moobs', or male breasts, reduced. David Beckham has the 'perfect, almond-shaped nipple' according to the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons . But some are so worried about the state of their nipples that they go under the knife solely to have them altered. They pay up to £2,000 for this – and spend up to a fortnight recovering. The revelation come from a surgeon who has researched the shape of the ideal male nipple. Jeyaram Srinivasan, of the Royal Preston Hospital, asked 62 volunteers to study topless photos of 100 men and say which had the most desirable nipples. Some of the models were ordinary males who worked in the hospital, others were body-conscious gym goers. Both sexes plumped for symmetrical nipples that were small, flat and slightly darker than the surrounding skin. The ideal nipple is also round or almond-shaped, the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons  annual conference heard. In case you are wondering, David Beckham, apparently, has perfect almond-shaped nipples. Mark Wright, of The Only Way is Essex, has poster-boy round nipples. More men are opting for £2000 surgery to achieve small, flat, round nipples like Beckham's . Dr Srinivasan's study also showed that women are more put off than men by nipples that protrude. The surgeon, who does private as well as NHS work, does around 40 nipple reductions a year. Most of these are in men whose nipples seem to large after extreme weight loss or after surgery to remove their 'man boobs'. But some are in men who are simply anxious that their nipples are too big. These men are often body builders who have compared their chest to other men in the gym. Dr Srinivasan said: 'For many years, cosmetic surgery was associated with women and men wouldn't even talk about it. They thought it was too vain. 'But now, men say: ""If I can have something to make me look better and I can afford it, I will do it."" 'The view has changed.' Those can't afford the £2,000, or are squeamish about the 45-mintue op, have another option. The study showed that a sculpted chest can often more than make up for nasty nipples. Dr Srinivasan said: 'A well-toned torso will make people accept a nipple that is less than ideal. 'They are distracted by something more important to look at.'","More men are opting for 'moob' or nipple surgery costing up to £2,000 .

"Coconuts could play a key role in making non-polluting cars that only emit water, a reality. For years, scientists have been working out how to develop fuel cell cars powered by pure hydrogen, but are unsure how to store the substance effectively. Now, they may be close to solving this problem using the unlikely candidate. Researchers from India’s Benaras Hindu University have used coconut kernels (pictured) to store hydrogen. They say the material is plentiful, cheap and easily be converted into carbon . Researchers from India’s Benaras Hindu University used coconut kernels to store hydrogen in gas form,Quartz India reported. Storing liquid hydrogen is notoriously difficult as it must be held at extremely low temperatures, which is expensive and tricky in the confines of a car. To store it in its gaseous state, would mean that vehicles would have to be fitted with large, pressurised tanks, which is not practical. So instead, experts have focused on finding materials, such as carbon, which can absorb hydrogen and release it on demand. Scientists have been working on developing hydrogen-powered cars for two decades. They only emit water and heat, instead of pollutants. Nissan-Renault, Daimler and Ford have joined forces with the ambitious aim of bringing an affordable car to market in four years’ time and Hyundai's Tucson (pictured) is being trialled . Professor Viney Dixit and his team, at the university’s Hydrogen Energy Centre created carbon from coconut kernels, which contain fatty and organic acids as well as potassium, magnesium and sodium. He says that the kernels, which are easily found, are cheap and can easily be converted into carbon. ‘Unlike graphene, Carbon nano tubes (CNTs) and other type of carbons, the production of carbon from solid endosperm is not time taking, he wrote in a research paper. ‘Therefore, its cost-effectiveness, good adsorption capacity and easy availability are its advantageous factors in regard to hydrogen storage.’ The researchers found that the carbon produced from the kernels could store a ‘considerable’ amount of hydrogen. The US Department of Energy predicts that hydrogen storage systems will need a capacity of at least 5.5 weight per cent to be commercially viable and it could be a while until this is demonstrated on a large scale. Scientists have been working on developing hydrogen-powered cars for two decades. Toyota is developing a $69,000 (£43,350) car using the technology, called the Mirai and Nissan-Renault, Daimler and Ford have joined forces with the ambitious aim of bringing an affordable car to market in four years’ time. This week, engineers have designed a concept for a fusion reactor which, when scaled up to the size of a large electrical power plant, would rival costs for a new coal-fired plant with similar electrical output. Until now no-one has come up with a fusion power plant design – dubbed the ‘holy grail’ of energy generation by many - that would produce fuel cheap enough to outperform systems that use fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. ‘Right now, this design has the greatest potential of producing economical fusion power of any current concept,’ said Thomas Jarboe, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the University of Washington. Engineers have designed a concept for a fusion reactor (pictured) that, when scaled up to the size of a large electrical power plant, would rival costs for a new coal-fired plant with similar electrical output . The design builds on existing technology and creates a magnetic field within a closed space to hold plasma in place long enough for fusion to occur - allowing the hot plasma to react and burn. The reactor itself would be largely self-sustaining, meaning it would continuously heat the plasma to maintain thermonuclear conditions. Heat generated from the reactor would heat up a coolant that is used to spin a turbine and generate electricity, similar to how a typical power reactor works. Mr Sutherland said: ‘This is a much more elegant solution because the medium in which you generate fusion is the medium in which you’re also driving all the current required to confine it.’ There are several ways to create a magnetic field, which is crucial for keeping a fusion reactor going. The new design is known as a spheromak, meaning it generates the majority of magnetic fields by driving electrical currents into the plasma itself. This reduces the amount of required materials and allows researchers to shrink the overall size of the reactor. The researchers estimated the cost of building a fusion reactor power plant using their design compared to building a coal power plant. They explained that building a fusion power plant producing 1 gigawatt (1 billion watts) of power would cost $2.7 billion (£1.7 billion), while a coal plant of the same output would cost $2.8 billion (£1.8 billion), according to their analysis. Mr Sutherland said: ‘If we do invest in this type of fusion, we could be rewarded because the commercial reactor unit already looks economical. It’s very exciting.’","Researchers have used coconut kernels to store hydrogen, taking a step closer to making clean fuel cell cars affordable .

"French Prime Minister Manuel Valls was yesterday blasted for turning into a 'fuddy-duddy' version of Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair. Cecile Duflot, who until recently was a member of the Socialist government, is furious at its apparent U-turn in favour of business. Attacking the increasingly right-wing M Valls, she said: 'Imitating Thatcher in 2014, it's very sad. The value of a company is also created by its workers.' Prime Minister Manuel Valls (left) shakes hands with President Francois Hollande . In an interview with Les Echos newspaper, the former housing minister added: 'The stand-up liberal Manuel Valls reveals in his stance a strategy of communication aimed at appearing modern. 'To be modern, does not mean being a Blairite-Thatcherism fuddy-duddy. Being modern, is to say that the ecological transition is our economic horizon and that it's approved by companies.' M Valls infuriated left-wingers earlier this week by telling members of France' s main employers' union, Medef: 'I love business'. This was despite his party coming to power in 2012 after President Francois Hollande said he 'disliked' big business and viewed the world of finance as his 'enemy'. Mrs Thatcher acknowledges the applause at the end of the Conservative Party conference in Blackpool . There has since been a change of tack by both President Hollande and M Valls as, faced with record unemployment and a stagnated economy, they try to improve the situation. They have already replaced left-wing rebel Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg with Emmanuel Macron, a former Rothschild merchant banker. Tony Blair - hated by many in his own party . Former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is widely admired by many French business people for the way she revolutionised Britain during the 1980s, but despised by the Left. Ex Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair is also viewed as a radical who rejected Socialist dogma in favour of pro-business policies. Allegedly trying to sound like both of them, M Valls told the Medef members earlier this week: 'France needs you. 'I know it is the custom to pit the Left against the business world, it's an old tune. But I deeply believe that our country needs to shake off this position, these role-plays that we are so used to. 'It has made us lose too much time, and our country is dying because of these positions.' The French government is now placing all its faith in a so-called 'Responsibility Pact' which will see firms benefit from €40 million worth of tax breaks in the hope that they will recruit 500,000 new staff over the next three years. But many fear that the left wing rebellion will grow in intensity, inevitably leading to the end of the Socialists time in power.","Cecile Duflot, until recently a member of Socialist government, furious at apparent U-turn in favour of business .

"Ed Miliband is being urged by Labour MPs to give up hopes of securing a decent Commons majority and focus resources on 'limping' into Number 10. Senior Labour figures have told MailOnline the leadership must slash the number of target seats from 106 to as few as 70. It comes amid growing fears that Mr Miliband's personal unpopularity is holding the party back and will fail to make inroads in enough constituencies to give him an outright majority. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured in Northampton yesterday, is being urged to dramatically scale back his target seat list after a collapse in his personal ratings . Labour insiders admit that many of the 25 seats needed even for Labour to become the biggest party (right) are now unwinnable, and could struggle to defend some seats against the Tories (left) Ed Miliband today sought to shake off speculation about his leadership with a promise to take the general election fight to the streets. In a 1,000-word Facebook post, he said next May's vote will 'decide the future direction of our country'. He added: 'Labour will fight and win this election street by street, house by house, taking our case to the people on every issue. 'That is how I am going to be spending the next six months. That is what my Shadow Cabinet and our MPs will be doing. 'That is what our councillors, party members and activists will be doing – because that is what they do week in and week out – and they know that is how we win. 'We are in the fight for the future of our country and in the General Election Labour will show we are equal to the challenges of the time in which we live.' Today marks six months to go until the general election, when Mr Miliband hopes to return Labour to power. Last night Mr Miliband dismissed talk of a leadership coup against him as 'nonsense'. Today Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham were forced to issue statements dismissing reports they were planning for a 'post-Miliband future'. Labour currently has 257 seats and needs to win another 24 from the Tories to become the biggest party and at least 70 to secure an outright majority and not have to enter a coalition. At present Labour has a list of 106 target seats given additional money, support and activists in a drive to woo swing voters and give Labour a sizeable Commons majority of almost 40 seats. But there are now calls for the ambitions to be dramatically scaled back to just 70 seats, which would be enough for Labour to secure a majority of just two. A shadow minister told MailOnline: 'You look at the list of marginal seats, and I have been to a lot of them, and you just think we're not going to win that one, we're not going to win that one… . 'We are not going to win 106 more seats. Somebody needs to have a difficult conversation with the people in 30 or 40 of those seats and say 'look, we can't justify giving you extra money when you're not going to win'. 'The money would be better spent on 70 key seats in the hope we can limp over the line.' The admission comes after a meeting of North West Labour MPs this week where the idea of abandoning dozens of target seats was also discussed. The gathering of 30 or so North West based MPs was chaired by the Blairite veteran and former Cabinet minister Hazel Blears. She has been sidelined by party high command since the election defeat of 2010, but has long argued that Labour must broaden its appeal. Mr Miliband's team had hoped that the rise of Ukip would eat into Tory support allowing Labour seize seats across the country. But the party was stunned by the recent Heywood and Middleton by-election in its Greater Manchester heartland where Ukip came within 600 votes of taking a supposedly safe Labour seat. Labour needs to take 24 seats directly off the Tories to make it the biggest party in the Commons. However, there is a growing sense that it will struggle to retake key seats like Rossendale and Darwen or Bury North. 'We think we're going to get Brighton Pavillion back from the Greens, but Caroline Lucas is so dug in we've got no chance,' said one normally loyal Labour MP. 'We need to be realistic and direct what money we've got at the seats we stand some chance of winning.' Labour MPs are also dismayed at a collapse in support in Scotland. A devastating poll last week suggested Labour is facing near-wipeout north of the border. Ipsos Mori found that 52 per cent of Scots would vote for the SNP if there, compared with just 23 per cent for Labour. A devastating IpsosMORI poll for STV last week revealed how support for the SNP has surged since 201 . It means Labour would be left with a rump of just four MPs, shattering Mr Miliband's hopes of becoming Prime Minister. A former Labour minister told MailOnline: 'I went to Scotland during the referendum campaign and even in our strong areas like Glasgow the organisation is hopeless.' At the 2010 general election Labour won 42 per cent of the Scottish vote, compared with the SNP's share of 19.9 per cent. Polls show Mr Miliband he is now less popular than every leader for 30 years who has taken their party to defeat in a general election, with 'depressed' Labour MPs fearing he will cost them victory in 2015. Even Gordon Brown's personal ratings were better six months before he too Labour to defeat. Several senior Labour figures now believe the party would be performing better with almost anyone else in charge. Analysis of IpsosMORI polling dating back to 1977 by MailOnline shows how only Michael Foot had worse personal satisfaction ratings than Ed Miliband six months before a general election . Face-off: Andy Burnham, left, has union backing, while Yvette Cooper, right, is the bookies' favourits . Mr Miliband's fate appears to hinge on whether shadow ministers – some of whom are understood to have met privately to discuss his future – can agree on his fate and engineer a 'coronation' rather than a divisive leadership contest with an election only months away. The Times reported that Ms Cooper, the shadow home secretary, and Mr Burnham, the shadow education secretary, to have struck a 'non-aggression pact'. But a spokesman for  Ms Cooper said there was 'no foundation whatsoever' to the suggestion. 'The spreading of lies like this only damages the Labour Party and should be seen as exactly what it is - complete and utter garbage,' he said. 'Yvette, the shadow cabinet and the party are united behind Ed's leadership.' Shadow health secretary Mr Burnham said: 'The stories in today's newspapers are complete and pure fiction. There is not a shred of truth in them. 'What I think it's part of is a deliberate and desperate attempt to destabilise the Labour Party and to divide us. But I can say this: it won't work. We are a united team, we are united behind Ed.' He told Sky News: 'My focus is on the NHS, exposing the damage that this Government is doing and working hard to deliver the Labour government that this country needs and certainly that my constituency needs. 'That is where my focus is. I'm working hard to support Ed Miliband in every single way I can.' Writing on the Politics Home website, shadow business secretary Mr Umunna said the rumblings were 'nonsense which some in the Westminster bubble want to distract us with'. Mr Umunna added: 'The simple fact is that because of Ed Miliband's leadership we are now within touching distance of being what many thought impossible four years ago. 'We have a leader who has kept us united and overseen the renewal which so eluded us at the end of our time in government. Ed is an honest, sincere man of deep beliefs.' Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: 'Ed Miliband is the right person to lead Labour and the right person to lead Britain. He has shown the ideas and the leadership to take Labour into government and to complete the historic task of Labour as a one-term opposition. 'We're focused on the issues that matter to voters - on the cost of living crisis facing my constituents in Stoke-on-Trent, on the NHS, on reforming technical and vocational education to give every young person the opportunity to reach his or her potential. 'We're a united party and that will remain as we expose the failures of David Cameron's woeful record.'","EXCLUSIVE: Frontbenchers call on Labour leader to scale back ambitions .

"Liberia is banning journalists from Ebola clinics in defiance of media rights campaigners who have warned panicked African governments against 'muzzling' reporters. A government spokesman made the announcement as he was questioned on a radio phone-in show about reporters being barred from covering a strike at a Monrovia Ebola treatment unit (ETU). Journalists had been denied access to the treatment clinic to cover a nationwide 'slow day' of action by healthcare workers demanding risk bonuses for treating Ebola. Scroll down for video . Journalists have been banned from entering Liberian treatment units (pictured) and denied access to cover the ongoing staff pay protests and strike action . The announcement comes after soldiers prevented media in Guinea from investigating the murders in September of eight people - including three journalists - during an Ebola education visit. And Sierra Leone, another country badly affected by the epidemic, is threatening draconian measures against journalists criticizing its Ebola response. Liberian government spokesman Isaac Jackson told radio station Sky FM: 'Journalists are no longer allowed to enter ETUs. These journalists enter the ETUs and cross red lines. 'They violate people's privacy, take pictures that they will sell to international institutions. We are putting an end to that.' The minister said he would insist that journalists report his statements from now on rather than what they saw for themselves. Sources from global aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF, Doctors Without Borders), which runs a unit of around 250 beds in Monrovia, said it would be writing to the government to ask to be excluded from the ban. Liberia is ranked 89th out of 180 countries in the 2014 press freedom index produced by Reporters Without Borders. The media rights campaign group warned that panicked governments fighting the epidemic were 'quarantining' reporters to prevent them covering the crisis. 'Combating the epidemic needs good media reporting but panicked governments are muzzling journalists,' the organisation said. Sierra Leone is also threatening draconian measures against reporters critical of the government's Ebola response. Pictured are Liberian health workers receiving assistance putting on their protective gear . The Ebola treatment clinics in West Africa run by international NGOs are vastly under-resourced . In Liberia, medics have also been banned from communicating directly with the media, RSF said. The Island Clinic, Liberia's largest government Ebola treatment centre, is run by the World Health Organization (WHO) and opened in September. Like all units run by NGOs, it is under-resourced and overrun by demand, forced to fill in for a public health infrastructure that has been decimated by 14 years of civil war and grinding poverty. Although the 'go slow' campaign was officially due to start on Friday, the clinic has been crippled by staff protests all week. 'Most of the workers are no longer coming to work. The few ones who come don't work. We don't have the manpower needed to do the work here at the centre,' director Atai Omoruto told reporters before the government clampdown. Omoruto said the centre had been designed for a maximum capacity of 150 beds but had been forced to take in 300 patients. Alphonso Wesseh, representing the clinic's healthcare workers, said the government had refused to pay benefits for dealing with Ebola and salaries were as low as $250 a month. 'We cannot work under these conditions. We are risking our lives every day and the government remains insensitive to our plight. This is not human.' A team of health workers bury the body of an Ebola victim in Liberia . Ebola, which spreads through contact with bodily fluids, has infected around 8,000 people and killed almost half of them. Liberia, the country hit hardest by the outbreak, has seen more than 2,000 deaths -- including 94 healthcare workers -- from the haemorrhagic fever which the virus causes. The government announced on Wednesday it was postponing nationwide senatorial elections which had been due on Tuesday next week, with no new date yet announced. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and her counterparts in Sierra Leone and Guinea pressed the heads of the International Monetary Fund, United Nations and World Bank on Thursday for a more rapid rollout of support to fight the epidemic. Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (pictured) has requested additional support from the International Monetary Fund to help pay healthcare workers . Finance ministers and representatives from around the world pictured during this week's Ebola crisis meeting . 'This will also require support for compensation to healthcare workers who, for fear of the risk involved, have refused or are reluctant to return to work,' she told the Washington conference via video link. The United Nations said on Friday it had quarantined 41 personnel from its Liberia mission, including 20 soldiers, following a second Ebola infection among its staff. The measure came two days after the mission, known as UNMIL, announced an 'international staff member' working in its medical department tested positive after complaining of symptoms consistent with the Ebola virus.","Journalists in Liberia banned from reporting in Ebola treatment units .

"An HIV scare involving a porn movie actor has spurred another call to halt production in California's adult film industry. The Free Speech Coalition, a California-based trade group representing the industry is calling for a three-day production moratorium following a possible HIV exposure on an out-of-state film set. The Los Angeles Times reports the group called for the halt on Wednesday but didn't name the state where the film set was located. The Free Speech Coalition, a California-based trade group representing the industry is calling for a three-day production moratorium following a possible HIV exposure on an out-of-state film set . The coalition last called for an industry moratorium in August after a report that a performer tested positive for HIV. However, it lifted the two-day ban after determining the test result was a false positive. The group's CEO, Diane Duke, says she's working with public health officials, the production company and the performer to investigate the incident. She said: 'As with past production holds, we ask that people refrain from speculation until more news is forthcoming, and respect performer privacy'. Production of porn movies has shifted away from California since a law requiring actors to wear condoms was passed . An announcement is expected Friday on whether production can resume and whether performers should have additional HIV testing. Production of porn movies has shifted away from California since a law requiring actors to wear condoms was passed. Last year only 40 permits for adult productions were issued across the city and county - a 90 per cent drop from 2012 when the measure was passed. Porn production crews are now said to be mostly traveling to Nevada, Southern California, Florida, and Eastern Europe to film. Porn production crews are now said to be mostly traveling to Nevada, Southern California, Florida, and Eastern Europe to film . An earlier moratorium ended last September, at which point performers became required to test for HIV and other STIs every 14 days instead of every 28. Prior to that, a performer who goes by the name Cameron Bay made national headlines when she tested positive for HIV followed by her adult film actor boyfriend. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which successfully fought to require condoms for porn actors in Los Angeles city and county,  said it underscored the need for statewide action.","Calls for 3-day production moratorium following a possible HIV exposure .

"Former Federal prosecutor Robert Fiske said he was set to indict several  Arkansas politicians and businessmen before he was removed from the case . The original federal prosecutor assigned to investigate Bill and Hillary Clinton's alleged involvement in the so-called Whitewater scandal has told how he was set to indict several high-level Arkansas politicians and businessmen before being removed from the case. Former U.S. Attorney Robert Fiske claims he uncovered 'serious crimes' while investigating the affair in the early 1990s and was left angry and frustrated when  a panel of federal judges replaced him on the grounds  he was not independent enough. And in a forthcoming memoir Mr Fiske tells how his team viewed David Hale - the man who famously accused Bill Clinton of pressuring him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan - as a 'credible witness'. Mr Fiske said that by the summer of 1994, he was preparing to bring eight indictments against 11 defendants. These included criminal charges for fraud against the Clintons' Whitewater business partners Jim and Susan McDougal, Hillary Clinton's former law partner and associate attorney general Webster Hubbell and Bill Clinton's successor as governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker. Mr Fiske claims his removal as prosecutor was a major blow to the investigation and caused the probe to drag on far longer than it should have. His replacement Kenneth Starr was a former federal appellate judge who had no prosecutorial experience. Mr Fiske told Yahoo News: 'The simplest way to put it, after I was replaced, the lawyers on the staff in Arkansas said the agents for the FBI and IRS were totally demoralized. 'They thought we were on the brink of doing all these great things, and now that was not going to happen.' Bill and Hillary Clinton pictured in 19992. The affair dogged the couple throughout Mr Clinton's years as president. He has always strenuously denied any wrong doing . The scandal which dogged Bill Clinton throughout his years as President began when a Resolution Trust Corporation investigator submitted a criminal referral to the FBI naming Bill and Hillary Clinton as witnesses in the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, a business owned by the Clinton's business partners Jim and Susan McDougal. Claims: Former municipal judge David Hale accused Mr Clinton of pressuring him to make an illegal $300,000 loan . Although the Little Rock U.S. Attorney  and the FBI believed  the referral lacked merit, the investigator, L. Jean Lewis, issued several additional referrals against the Clintons. After these became public knowledge, she testified before the Senate Whitewater Committee in 1994. But the most incendiary allegations against the Clintons came from David Hale, the owner of a federally subsidized small-business lending company and a former municipal judge. Hale claimed that Clinton had pressured him to make an illegal $300,000 federally-backed loan to Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan. He claimed the money was to be used to pay off the Clintons and the McDougal's debts following the failed Whitewater real estate project. According to Hale, Clinton told him: 'My name can't show up on this'. The Clintons have always streneously denied the allegations, deriding the entire affair as little more than a politically-motivated smear campaign. Their supporters point to the fact that Hale failed to mention the Clintons during the original FBI investigation of Madison Guaranty in 1989. Three separate inquiries found insufficient evidence to link the Clintons to any crimes. However the McDougals were convicted following a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. Susan McDougal served 18 months in prison after being held in contempt of court after refusing to answer any questions relating to Whitewater. She was granted a pardon by President Clinton just before leaving office. Bill Clinton's successor as Arkansas Governor, Jim Guy Tucker, also served time in prison after his role in the fraud was revealed. The Whitewater affair is likely to return to haunt Hillary Clinton if she runs for President . In his book Mr Fiske tells how Hale's information helped the investigation and that his team had vetted Hale's story. He added: 'Standing alone, nobody was going to bring a case based on what he was telling us. 'But from what we had seen of him, we thought the story was plausible and was certainly worth pursuing.' Curiously Mr Fiske was hauled off the case because he had been appointed by Clinton's attorney general - which the conservative federal judges claime meant he was not independent enough. While little new has emerged surrounding the case in recent years it looks set to come back to haunt Hillary Clinton if she runs for president.","Former U.S. Attorney Robert Fiske investigated the affair in the 1990s .

"Disgraced charity boss Greg Mortenson has returned to Afghanistan in a desperate bid to repair his shattered reputation after being found to have misused funds and lied repeatedly in his best-selling book. The 'Three Cups of Tea' author was pictured visiting female students at a middle school established by his Central Asia Institute charity, in Afghanistan’s Logar province. Three years ago, Mortenson's world came crashing down after '60 Minutes' and author Jon Krakauer alleged he had fabricated much of the book and mismanaged the charity which he co-founded. Scroll down for video . Three Cups of Tea author Greg Mortenson has returned to Afghanistan after his reputation was left in tatters when he was found to have lied repeatedly in his best-selling book . Mortenson was subsequently found to have spent millions in donations on his personal expenses, including travel and clothing. Three Cups of Tea details how Mortenson resolved to build schools in Central Asia after he became lost and wandered into a poor Pakistani village, then follows him as he expands his school-building efforts there. Among many indiscrepancies was Mr Mortenson's account that he wandered lost into the village of Korphe in Pakistan after trying to climb the world's second-highest peak, K2, then decided to build a school there. His previous writings made no mention of his being lost or wandering into Korphe, and he also previously indicated that he originally planned to build that first school in another village. 60 Minutes revealed that Mortenson made up large parts of his best-seller Three Cups of Tea, and its sequel Stones Into Schools . In an interview published in the Washington Post he now admits he was only in Korphe for a few hours saying his relationships with villagers developed on subsequent visits. He said: 'It was obviously a lie. 'I stand by the story, but there were compressions and omissions.' He now admits that said that he didn’t pay close attention to the writing of the book,and that it was largely penned by his co-author, David Oliver Relin. Mr Relin tragically committed suicide after the inaccuracies in the book were exposed. The book was originally conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of the Central Asia Institute, which Mortenson founded in 1996 with a $1million donation from Dr. Jean Hoerni, a Swiss physicist and mountaineer. An attorney general's investigation resulted in Mortenson reimbursing the organization more than $1.1million, removing him from any financial decisions and making wholesale changes to the organization's leadership. He added: 'I suck as an administrator. 'The book was the best thing we had. By promoting the book, I was bringing in money to CAI.' Mortenson was also accused of not building some of the Afghanistan schools he claimed to have built. Others were revealed not to have had any students. He has previously said he plans to eventually leave the organization, but first wants to help raise contributions so they match expenses. He still understood to be the highest-paid employee of Central Asia Institute, drawing $169,000 in salaries and benefits last year. The scandal caused the charity to lose most of its donors, with contributions plummeting from a high of about $22million in 2010 to $2.7million last year. After its release in 2006, Three Cups of Tea became a best seller and it, along with Mortenson's tireless promotion that included more than 500 speaking engagements in four years, resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations to the Central Asia Institute - the charity he ran. In one particularly famous wrong recollection published is how he held Mother Teresa's hand while her body was lying in state in 2000. Mother Teresa passed away in 1997 - the same week that Princess Diana lost her life in car crash in Paris. Scrutiny: The book follows the adventures of co-author Greg Mortenson, pictured in Wakhan, northeastern Afghanistan in 2009, as he set up schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan . He was said to have reaped financial benefits at the expense of the CAI, including the free promotion of Three Cups of Tea and his later book, Stones Into Schools. He also pocketed the royalties from thousands of copies CAI bought to donate to libraries, schools, churches and military personnel, a 2012 report by the Montana Attorney General said. Mortenson has been accused in past lawsuits filed against him by readers of racketeering, fraud, deceit, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. However, in the aftermath of the 60 Minutes investigation Mortenson was accused of mismanagement of the non-profit organization he co-founded to build schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan and spent millions of dollars of charity money on charter flights, family vacations and luxury personal items. Charity: Greg Mortenson with local businesswomen in Gojal Hunza, in Pakistan - where his charity worked to improve the quality of life for people there. However, the 60 Minutes report found that what school she Mortenson's foundation did build, many were repurposed or left without support . Mortenson's control of the Central Asia Institute went largely unchallenged by its board of directors, which consisted of himself and two people loyal to him, the report prepared by the Montana Attorney General's office said. When an employee would question his practices, Mortenson either resisted or ignored the person. The result was a lack of financial accountability in which large amounts of cash sent overseas were never accounted for. Itemized expenses listed as program-related were missing supporting receipts and documentation. Employees and family members charged items such as health club dues and gifts to CAI credit cards. In 2012, Mortenson was told he must reimburse the charity more than $1million under a settlement agreement - according to Montana's Attorney General. The attorney general's probe focused only on the charity's finances and operations, and did not examine the books' contents. The yearlong investigation from 2011 to 2012 concluded that the Central Asia Institute took in far more donations than it spent, and had $23million in reserves. Greg Mortenson's best-selling book 'Three Cups of Tea' came under intense scrutiny after 60 Minutes, author Jon Krakauer and some people in the book said some of the stories were fabricated. Here is a glance at some of those stories, what is being disputed and Mortenson's response in a recent interview with The Associated Press. MORTENSON'S DESCENT FROM K2: . Three Cups of Tea: Mortenson stumbled upon the Pakistani village of Korphe in fall 1993 after trekking from the base camp of K2, the world's second-highest peak. He spent days in the village recovering from the descent. The dispute: Mortenson could not have wandered to Korphe on that trip because it is on the opposite side of the Braldu River, which could not be crossed without reaching Mortenson's original destination on the opposite shore, the village of Askole. Author Jon Krakauer says no bridge crossing existed. Krakauer says he interviewed a climber and others who confirmed a bridge was at that location before and after that period, but not at the time Mortenson was there. Mortenson's response: Mortenson insists he went to Korphe over a narrow footbridge, and disputes Krakauer's assertions to the contrary. Mortenson has acknowledged that he spent only a few hours there, not days as was depicted in the book. MORTENSON'S PROMISE TO BUILD A SCHOOL: . Three Cups of Tea: Mortenson promised the villagers of Korphe that he would build them a school, after they nursed him back to health. That promise forever changed his life, and he dedicated himself to building schools in Central Asia. The dispute: Since Mortenson never went to Korphe, he couldn't have promised to build them a school. However, he did promise the villagers of Khane to the southeast that he would build them a school, but he reneged on that promise and instead built it in Korphe. A fundraising plea written by Mortenson in 1994 backs up the claim that he wanted to build the school in Khane, and it makes no mention of Korphe. Mortenson's response: Mortenson now says he visited both Korphe and Khane villages during that 1993 trip, and promised the residents of both that he would build schools for them. He says he planned to first build the Khane school but then switched to Korphe after finding a lack of local support and corruption in the first. MORTENSON'S KIDNAPPING: . Three Cups of Tea: Mortenson was kidnapped and held hostage by militants in the remote Pakistani region of Waziristan. They took his passport and money, kept him under armed guard and monitored his every movement. He won his freedom after asking for a Koran and telling his captors that his wife was expecting a child. The dispute: People who were there described Mortenson as a guest in Waziristan, not a hostage. A photo shows him with his supposed captors, with Mortenson brandishing an AK-47. Mortenson's response: Mortenson stands by his story, though he says he regrets the unflattering descriptions of his captors in 'Three Cups of Tea.'","Greg Mortenson co-wrote the best-seller 'Three Cups of Tea'

"Police reinforcement arrived in Calais last night after a mass attempt by up to 400 illegal migrants to storm lorries heading for Britain. Tear gas was used on a crowd of mainly young men who were taking part in a ‘clearly coordinated attack’. Despite their efforts, some of the migrants, thought mostly to be from north Africa, may have managed to stow away on vehicles before they crossed the Channel, officials said. Earlier this year a group of migrants were seen trying to sneak onto a lorry in the French coastal town. Today police used tear gas to prevent crowds from storming vehicles bound for the UK . ‘There were between 300 and 400 of them and they all rushed the lorries at once,’ said a local police spokesman. ‘It was such a serious situation that CRS riot squad officers had to use tear gas and batons – it was a highly charged incident. 'It happened during the late afternoon.’ The officer admitted that ‘some may have got aboard lorries’ in the chaos, which follows police complaints that they cannot cope with the rising tide of migrants. By nightfall reinforcements had been drafted into the port from nearby towns in northern France, including Boulogne and Lille. Police had no figures for arrests, although it is common practice for anyone involved in such incidents to be allowed to go free. Few of those involved have any papers, and there is very little the authorities can do with them. Thousands of migrants have set up camp in the French town in a desperate bid to gain entry to Britain by sneaking onto vehicles planning to cross the Channel . Last month terrified ferry workers had to use a power hose to keep back a gang of illegal migrants who stormed their way onto a ferry in Calais. Up to 250 repeatedly tried to get aboard the vessel, and its ramp eventually had to be raised. Some 100 of them initially forced a gate and climbed over a fence, and then there was a second incident involving around 150 migrants. Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart said she could close the port if the situation did not improve . The scenes evoked images of the early 2000s when would-be immigrants to Britain regularly tried to storm the entrance to the Channel Tunnel. Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart said she was sick of the numbers queuing up in northern France to try and sneak across the Channel. ‘I could take the decision to block the port,’ she said, following a meeting with Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve in Paris in August. ‘I could bring pressure to bear. It would be illegal, but today I want to make a strong gesture towards the British.’ She said that the UK ‘is considered an Eldorado’ by migrants, because of its generous benefits culture. Around 1200 migrants - mainly Eritreans, Sudanese and Afghans - are currently squatting in disused buildings in Calais, or living in temporary camps – ones which the French regularly raze. Ms Bouchart also attacked the British for not contributing enough money to security at Calais port. Fights between rival groups have become common place, as well as disturbances involving people smugglers who charge the equivalent of around £1000 for a passage across the Channel in a lorry or car. On August 4 Denis Robin, the Pas de Calais prefect, said that the illegal camps around the port would all be destroyed for health reasons.","An estimated 400 male migrants attempted to storm lorries in French town .

"French police fired tear gas and carried out baton charges on rioting illegal migrants yesterday as they tried to keep them away from UK-bound lorries in Calais. Dozens of mainly Eritreans were involved in the ugly confrontations at the port, which has been at the centre of numerous disturbances in recent weeks. The authorities are desperately trying to stem the growing numbers making their way across the Channel to Britain.

Many believe it is their legal right to get to Britain.’ Around 250 migrants formed themselves into a gang yesterday morning and then rushed vehicles queuing to get on board ferries . When an ambulance arrived to treat one of the migrants who had fallen over and hurt his head, a crowd gathered around him and began to threaten the medics. Barriers were torn down and a wire fence cut, said the police source, who confirmed that tear gas and baton charges were used. Around 1,200 migrants – mainly Eritreans, Sudanese and Afghans – are currently squatting in disused buildings and temporary camps in Calais . Earlier this month, police union spokesman Gilles Debove said tear gas was necessary to stop ‘mass onslaughts’ on vehicles. He claimed there has also been an increase in mugging and sexual assaults by migrants.

"An anaesthetist was almost three times the drink-drive limit when a British-born patient died in her care, it emerged yesterday. Belgian Helga Wauters, 45, had ‘difficulties with expression, comprehension and reactivity’ during a Caesarean section procedure. The medic, who admits a ‘pathological problem’ with alcohol, is accused of inserting a tube into the patient’s oesophagus instead of her windpipe during the procedure in France. The baby survived, but the 28-year-old mother-to-be, who has not been named, was starved of oxygen and suffered a fatal heart attack. In custody: Belgian Helga Wauters, 45, has been charged with aggravated manslaughter and faces up to five years in prison . Wauters was yesterday in custody charged with aggravated manslaughter and faces up to five years in prison. Prosecutors in Pau, south-west France, say the Belgian is guilty of a ‘deliberate violation of caution and security’. She was found to have 216 microgrammes of alcohol per litre of blood – the equivalent of four bottles of wine – when questioned. The legal driving limit in the UK is 80 microgrammes. Prosecutor Jean-Christophe Muller said investigators were looking at the conditions under which the procedure took place and if the use of anaesthetics and artificial respiration were ‘inconsistent’ with good practice. They are also concerned that Wauters’s behaviour was ‘not in its normal state’, he added. The alleged incident happened during a C-section last month at a maternity clinic in the town of Orthez. The patient died on September 27 after being transferred to another hospital in Pau. French health bosses say the maternity clinic faces being closed down. The regional health authority for Aquitaine, an area of France popular with British tourists, has suspended the clinic’s work while an ‘administrative investigation’ continues. Yves Darrigrand, the mayor of Orthez, argued that staffing problems were at the heart of the problem because ‘anaesthetists are very hard to find’. The ancient French town of Orthez, where Helga Wauters drunkenly performed a Caesarean section procedure, resulting in the death of a 28-year-old mother-to-be . He said the incident had exposed the ‘terrible shortage’ of specialists in obstetrics and gynaecology and anaesthesia who ‘sell their services at exorbitant prices’. Mr Darrigrand said many charged the equivalent of more than £800 a day, because they were in such short supply. Wauters, who has been held since Thursday, has practised since 1999 and was hired by the private clinic in Orthez earlier this year. She was not a member of staff. The patient came from Ustaritz, a small village in the Basque province of Labourd, some 40 miles away. She had asked to be taken to Orthez because of its ‘previously good reputation’, said Mr Darrigrand. Pau hospital confirmed that she was a French passport holder who was ‘born in Britain’. The cause of death was confirmed as ‘cardiac arrest’ and the woman’s child is now in the care of the hospital and other family members.","Belgian Helga Wauters, 45 was working at maternity clinic in Orthez, France .

"The detective who headed the Jimmy Savile inquiry is to investigate claims that up to 18 paedophile teachers abused dozens of young boys over five decades at a top public school. Detective Inspector David Gray, who led the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree, will command an investigation into claims that staff sexually abused pupils as young as nine as St Paul's School in central London and its preparatory school Colet Court. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is among the former pupils of St Paul's, which was established in 1509 and is considered one of the leading schools in the country. Allegations: The investigation was triggered by claims made by former pupils that staff sexually abused young boys at St Paul's School in central London and at its preparatory school Colet Court . Scene: Operation Winthorpe will focus on accusations from a number of former pupils that eight former schoolmasters at St Paul's and 10 at Colet Court (pictured) sexually abused dozens of young boys . The allegations were apparently reported to the police in recent weeks and focus on accusations from a number of former pupils that eight former schoolmasters sexually abused dozens of young boys between the mid-1960s and last year. The victims are thought to have been aged between nine and 17, and were abused in dormitories, classrooms, a swimming pool, inside a car, and at teacher's home. The inquiry comes just months after classics teacher Anthony Fuggle, 57, resigned his post after he was arrested and bailed on suspicion of possession of indecent images. According to The Times, detectives have already compiled a list of 100 victims, suspects and potential witnesses following the claims against the former schoolmasters - some of whom are no longer alive. The paper also revealed that a second teacher, Tim Harbord, 61, was arrested on suspicion of grooming a child. However he was not charged and denies the allegations. The involvement of Mr Gray, who is the head of Scotland Yard's paedophile unit, will be to oversee the carrying out of a 'thorough and transparent review' of alleged sexual abuse at the two schools. He said: 'The investigation will be conducted by a dedicated team of specially-trained officers who have experience of historic child abuse investigations and are sensitive to the needs of the victims.'

"Thousands of Britons were among those caught up in travel chaos today as Air France cancelled half of its flights because of strike action. Pilots working for the troubled airline were taking action against its plan to pour more money into its low-cost subsidiary Transavia. The strike, which is expected to cost around £15m a day, saw lengthy queues building up at major airports as thousands were stranded. The strike, which is expected to cost around £15m a day, saw large queues building up at major airports as thousands were stranded . ‘It’s an absolutely chaotic situation – I’m desperate to get to Nice from Paris but nothing seems to be moving,’ said businessman David Newman, who is originally from Birmingham. ‘Lots of services have been cancelled completely, but information is very hard to come by. It’s a ridiculous situation. ‘Air travel in France is always being hit by strikes – the country needs to sort this matter out.’ Britons are the biggest visitor group in the world to Paris, while thousands of others use France as a hub to get to other parts of the world. Air France sent 65,000 text messages to passengers warning them about cancellations and delays, but thousands just turned up anyway. A company spokesman urged those ‘who have booked a flight between September 15 and 22 to delay their trip, change their ticket free of charge or claim a refund.’ Dozens of British passengers were stuck at Marseille-Marignane airport in the south of France on Monday . An Air France spokesman warned those who have a flight booked with the airline for the next week to 'delay their trip, change their ticket free of charge or claim a refund’ Jean-Philippe Beauchene, another stranded passenger, said: ‘What are we meant to do, just sit at home when we’re meant to be somewhere else?’ ‘At least while you’re at the airport you have a slim chance of travelling. Just giving up is not an option for most people.’ SNPL, the main pilots’ union at Air France, warned that up to 80 per cent of flights could be cancelled as the strike continues into this week. Air France employees fear that the development of their low-cost operator, Transavia, will lead to jobs being outsourced to other companies, and permanent jobs being reduced to part-time contracts. Jean-Louis Barber, the head of the SNPL union, told France’s AFP news agency: ‘This is about a point of principle. We’re not even talking about a rise in wages. Mr Barber added: ‘If the strike continues beyond September 15, the flight schedule will be modified as a result. The knock-on effects will be communicated to passengers the day before they are due to leave.’ In response to the strike, British company EasyJet on Saturday laid on 1,000 extra seats on flights from Paris to Toulouse and Nice.","A strike by Air France pilots left thousands of Brits stranded at airports .

"There was anger last night after it emerged militant group ISIS may have ordered compulsory female genital mutilation (FGM) for all women and girls in a region of Iraq now under its control. The extremist group has seized large swathes of the troubled country's northern regions and is now said to be imposing its hardline Sharia rules on the population. The United Nations expressed deep concern yesterday at reports all girls and women in and around city of Mosul are to being forced to undergo FGM procedures. Scroll down for video . ISIS militants have reportedly ordered that women and girls in an area of Iraq under their control undergo FGM . A UN spokesman in Geneva said that they were seeking clarity and trying to establish the facts. Such a 'fatwa' issued by the Sunni Muslim fighters would potentially affect 4million women and girls, according to UN resident and humanitarian coordinator in Iraq Jacqueline Badcoc. 'We have current reports of imposition of a directive that all female girl children and women up to the age of 49 must be circumcised. 'This is something very new for Iraq, particularly in this area, and is of grave concern and does need to be addressed,' Badcock said. 'This is not the will of Iraqi people, or the women of Iraq in these vulnerable areas covered by the terrorists,' she added. But doubts emerged on social media about the basis for the report. One document posted on Twitter suggested it may be a year old and have been issued by the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant, the group's previous name. The hardline group, whose members are pictured in Syria, have been parading through the streets of Iraq with military equipment since seizing large swathes of the country . The owner of one Twitter account, which contains multiple images of the decapitated heads of Syrian soldiers, said the claims were 'a lie'. Other Internet comments, including from Middle East analysts, questioned whether the order would fit with the cultural traditions of the region. There was no immediate comment from ISIS, which has led an offensive through northern and western Iraq. The U.N is said to have 'zero contact' with the miltants, but works through tribal leaders in the affected areas, Badcock said. She added: 'I can't give you any more details until we have been on the ground to get information.' The group have even published a report boasting of their achievements, including the number of bombings . FGM, the partial or total removal of external female genitalia, is a tradition practised widely in many African and Muslim countries and often justified as a means of suppressing a woman's sexual desire to prevent 'immoral' behaviour. Worldwide, more than 130 million girls and women have undergone FGM and more than 700 million women alive today were children when they were married. The practice of FGM previously occurred only in isolated pockets of Iraq, mainly Kurdistan, according to Badcock. Mosul city currently has some two million people, more than half of whom are women as there are many female-headed households in the area, she said. Several more million people live in surrounding areas, she added. 'There are reports of rapes of women, of forced marriages,' Badcock added.","Militant group in charge of northern Iraq accused of ordering  FGM .

"Pele remains in intensive care after undergoing an operation on his kidney but his condition has improved, say doctors treating the football legend. The 74-year-old has stopped dialysis in the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paolo and is now 'lucid and stable', according to medics. The former footballer was hospitalised on Monday after being diagnosed with a urinary tract infection following a surgery to remove kidney stones earlier this month. Pele remains in intensive care but is said to be showing signs of a good recovery after being admitted to hospital with a urinary tract infection having undergone surgery on his kidney earlier this month . Last week the hospital sparked concern for the athlete's health after revealing he had been admitted to an intensive care unit. But he has since said to have shown good signs of recovery and is responding well to antibiotics. Yesterday, his son Edinho said his father was 'very upbeat' and that he expected to be released from hospital by the end of next week. While doctors have stopped administering dialysis, they have not ruled out starting the treatment again if Pele's necessary. 'The renal support treatment was suspended until tomorrow, when its necessity will be re-evaluated,' Albert Einstein Hospital said in a statement. At one point in his sporting career the footballer had to have a kidney removed after breaking a rib during a match, though this is not thought to be affecting his health today. Brazilian and international media have been closely monitoring Pele’s condition since last week, when the hospital said he became unstable and was transferred to an intensive care unit. The former footballer has been in hospital since the beginning of the week after contracting an infection . Doctors at Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paolo said the 74-year-old was showing signs of recovery . On Friday the former footballer thanked his 1.93million Twitter followers for their support in his health battle . Earlier this week, the 74-year-old took to Twitter to share his gratitude for fans' well wishes and put an end to speculation on his health. 'I am blessed to receive your love and support, and thank God this is nothing serious,' he told 1.93million followers. 'I am looking forward to spending the upcoming holidays with my family, and will start the new year with renewed health, with many international trips already planned! Thank you!' he said. In the days beforehand, he dismissed rumours of his condition worsening, adding he needed to recover 'in peace'. After being released from hospital having undergone surgery for kidney stones on November 13, he thanked his followers for their support. 'Thank you to all of my fans, who sent in their concerns and well wishes to me from around the world. 'I dedicate everything I have to you! I am doing well, I will recover just fine.'

"A globetrotting bunny has been stolen after travelling the world to take snaps with its adventurous owner. Travel Bunny - as it is aptly known - visited more than 20 countries, taking an enviable series of snaps along the way with owner Peter Franc, from London. But after posing for snaps around the world, taking in iconic location from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, in Italy, to the Great Barrier Reef, in Australia, Travel Bunny was cruelly stolen from Peter's car. Enjoying the glamour: On his travels, the bunny managed to visit Dubai and see the iconic Burj al Arab hotel, shaped like a sail . La dolce vita: Travel Bunny also worked his way around Italy, visiting sights like the Leaning Tower of Pisa . Asian adventure: Travel Bunny also managed to see Angkor Wat, in Siem Reap, Cambodia, while travelling around South East Asia . The 33-year-old said the rabbit was stolen from his car in Italy, along with his passports, camera equipment and laptop. He said: 'I left my car unattended in a highway petrol station car park for less than two minutes, but it was enough time for the criminals to break the door open and relieve us of some possessions.' Peter, who is originally from Melbourne, Australia, began his adventure with Travel Bunny in 2005, after moving to Berlin. This is England: Stonehenge, in Wiltshire, also received a visit from Travel Bunny before eh was cruelly snatched from a car in Italy . Intrepid Peter Franc hopes to be reunited with his bunny, who accompanied him to the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . Down Under: Australian Peter also took his fluffy travel companion with him to visit Mount Tongariro on New Zealand's North Island . He said: 'I'd always loved rabbits, and received my first pet, creatively named ""Bunny"" when I was 8. 'When I moved to Berlin in 2005, I was given a toy rabbit for my birthday. 'Since it was the first time I was away from my parents, I had travel on my mind, and simply thought taking Travel Bunny on my trips would be a cute way to document where I'd been, to show my friends back home.' Czech mate: The rabbit also posed in front of Prague Castle on his travels through Europe with Peter, before he was stolen in 2010 . Now Peter, who even managed to take his Travel Bunny diving to thee the Great Barrier Reef, is looking for a replacement bunny to continue his journey . Scene of the crime: Travel Bunny was snatched from Peter's car, along with camera equipment and a laptop, in Italy . Peter travelled around the world with Travel Bunny, exploring a long list of countries including Germany, Norway, New Zealand, Italy, Singapore, Dubai, England, Australia and Vietnam. He said: 'I've been on many travels with many different people, and they've always loved being part of the Travel Bunny experience - seeing the photo from a particular place, and knowing they were there too. 'Most people look strangely at me, until they realise what I'm doing. Bucolic: In comparison with the dramatic peaks of the North Island, New Zealand's South Island has a rolling, lush landscape . Go east: Travel Bunny also made it to Russia to pose in front of the Church of Our Saviour on Spilled Blood in St Petersburg . 'I've had people take photos of me taking my photo, and some people have even requested to also take a photo of Travel Bunny - either on his own, or with them in front of the same scene!' After visiting 24 countries with Travel Bunny, Peter is now on a mission to try to re-create him after he was stolen in 2010. He says: 'Since he was taken from me, I've spent a long time trying to recreate him. Beer and bratwurst: Travel Bunny tucked into some local snacks in Munich while touring Germany with his owner .

'Unfortunately, no photos of Travel Bunny show his label tag with enough clarity to read the maker. In a bid to be reunited with his bunny, Peter has scoured online for similar plush toy rabbits and even approached companies in China to have the doll remade. He says: 'I attempted having one hand-made, but he just didn't turn out right.

"An overweight Labrador has been put on an intensive weight loss regime after gorging on chicken dinners led to him ballooning to more than nine stone. Labrador Mike shocked staff at the Dogs Trust when they discovered he tipped the scales at just under 60kg - 9st 5lbs - which is double what he should weigh. Mike, who is just three-years-old, has now been placed on a strict calorie-controlled diet and it is hoped his strained joints will get some help from the centre's hydrotherapy pool - once he can fit into it. Obese: Overweight Labrador Mike tips the scales at a staggering 60kg - 9st 5lbs - which is double what he should weigh . Weighing in: A stunned vet at the Dogs Trust in Loughborough, Leicestershire, puts Mike on the scales . Staff at the re-homing centre in Loughborough, Leicestershire, are currently taking Mike - who weighs more than famous singers Taylor Swift and Jennifer Lopez - for three short walks a day. Mike can currently only walk around 100 metres before getting out of breath. But staff hope this will improve as he loses weight. The 41-week plan is aimed at helping him lose one per cent of his body weight a week before reaching an initial target weight of 35kg. It is hoped Mike - who currently weighs the same as 150 tins of dog food - can eventually slim down to around 30-32kg which is a healthy size for a Labrador. The Labrador, whose elderly owner recently passed away, is joined at the centre by his brother Bud, who weighs 44kg, but they have to be fed their restricted calorie dog food separately in case Mike helps himself to his brother's. Unhealthy: Mike's shocking weight - which is around the same as 150 tins of dog food - is putting strain on his joints and organs . Hard work: Mike can only walk around 100 metres before he gets out of breath and needs a rest . Ella Tonge, Dogs Trust Loughborough Supporter Relations Officer: 'Mike is the largest dog we have had at Dogs Trust Loughborough. 'His diet had basically been full chicken dinners and other human-based food. He will eat pretty much anything. 'But we know that with some attention and a very strict diet we can help him shed those pounds. 'He now eats two small meals of restricted calorie dog food a day and we take him for three short walks. 'We are hoping hydrotherapy will help him lose some weight a little bit quicker by releasing some of the strain on his joint, but unfortunately he’s too large for the tank at the moment.' Calorie counting: Mike, pictured with Dogs Trust staff member Kate Hansell, has now been placed on a 41-week plan with a strict calorie controlled diet to help him lose the weight . Contrasting physiques: Golden Labrador Mike, who weighs nearly 60kg, looks significantly larger than black Labrador Rory, pictured left,  who weighs a healthy 24kg at The Dog's Trust in Loughborough . She added: 'He is such a loveable dog. None of us have seen a dog so overweight. He wants to play with everyone so we feel sorry for him that he can't yet. 'His plight highlights the danger of over-feeding your pet and even worse feeding them a human diet. 'What is fine for us to eat is not for them, especially when combined with very little exercise.' Once Mike is re-homed - the new owners will need to have room for both Mike and Bud - he will return to Dogs Trust Loughborough for weigh-ins every two weeks to make sure he's still on the right track. Paws for thought: Dogs Trust Veterinary Director Paula Boyden hopes Mike's case will show other dog owners how it important it is to feed their pet appropriate food . Looking for a new home: When Mike is a healthy weight the Dogs Trust will help him find a new home with his brother Bud who weighs 44kg . Dogs Trust Veterinary Director Paula Boyden said: 'The concern with Mike is the strain this excess weight is putting on his body, particularly his heart and joints. 'Human food is not an ideal balanced diet for your dog. 'Treats and special meals should be dog friendly, occasional and certainly not a replacement for his regular diet. 'Such treats are often highly calorific so if you are giving to your dog, reduce his daily meal portions accordingly.' Information on Mike and other dogs at Loughborough can be found at www.dogstrust.org.uk or they are on Twitter at @DT_Loughborough. Keeping on track: Once he has been re-homed, Mike will continue to visit the Dogs Trust in Loughborough every two weeks for weigh-ins to make sure he stays a healthy weight .","Labrador Mike was taken to the Dogs Trust in Loughborough, Leicestershire, after his elderly owner passed away .

"Devoted mother:  Myra Goldman , 68, seen here wearing sunglasses was on her way to her office when the massive gate suddenly came loose and toppled onto her . A petite mother was crushed to death by a giant metal gate at a business park after it toppled on top of her as she was unlocking it to go to work, an inquest heard. Myra Goldman, 68, was on her way to her office when the massive 8ft long and 6ft high gate suddenly came loose and pinned her tiny frame to the ground. The businesswoman who stood just 4ft 11in tall was crushed by the weight of the palisade gate, which was thought to have been damaged six months earlier, and died at the scene. The hearing was told the mother of three from Whitefield, Manchester had carried on working as a florist despite being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in 2011. In spite of her prognosis and suffering from a painful hip, Myra carried on her business arranging floral decorations for special occasions, turning up every day without fail to take telephone orders. Her husband, Cyril Goldman, 80, told the two day inquest: 'She was the type of person who couldn't find wrong in anybody. She wouldn't give up. She worked every day, no matter how busy it was.She never complained.' Mrs Goldman had arrived at the business park to complete an order for a customer in the Middle East at 10,30am on Sunday 3rd March 2013. She was crushed after she got out of her Citroen Picasso to manually open the 6ft high by 8ft wide entrance gate. Passer-by Daniel Massey who happened on the scene after visiting a barbers shop told the Oldham inquest: 'I saw a large metal gate on the floor and what appeared to be an object underneath. 'As I approached the metal gate I could see a person underneath. I immediately thought the person was beyond help. I rang 999 and spoke to the operator. 'I returned to the car and waited for the paramedics and police to arrive. The gate was 8ft long and 6ft high and made of metal. I would not have been able to move it.' Mrs Goldman set up her business in 1998 before moving to the Whitefield Business Centre where she shared a storage unit housing her flower company, Si Si Flowers, with a balloon company. She was described by her family as a 'devoted mother with strength and dignity.' Her husband of 40 years, a retired shop keeper, said he had encountered trouble when he previously opened the high security gate, which featured iron railings, himself when he went to the office with his wife. Mr Goldman said: 'Everyday I opened the locking bar, slid the lock off and pushed the right hand gate to the wall and held it there. If you did not and turned your back it would come back at you. It had a habit of swinging back and closing itself. 'I found no resistance from the gate but as a small petite woman it was heavy and hard to push forward. The locking bar had previously been damaged and never been replaced. This happened at least six months prior but I am not sure.' Talking of his wife's illness Mr Goldman added: 'She was unable to undergo chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The reason for that was that her lungs had deteriorated to such a degree that that form of treatment would not work. But she never complained. She wasn't the type of person to moan. I think she was lying about the pain. Scene of tragedy: Entrance to the Whitefield Business Centre in Manchester where florist, Mrs Goldman, was pinned down by the weight of the palisade gate . No longer standing: This is where the iron gate that crashed down on Mrs Goldman once stood, it has since been replaced . 'Although she was always tired, she did all the house work. She cooked, cleaned, did the washing and ironing She was the type of person that could not find wrong in anybody. Everybody liked her. She didn't' have any enemies.' Mrs Goldman had also ran a 5k Race for Life in a aid of Cancer Research and enjoyed visiting her son in Spain, where he worked as a flight instructor. A post mortem examination concluded that the cause of her death was 'traumatic asphyxia'. Home office pathologist Dr Naomi Carter said it was likely Mrs Goldman died within minutes of the fatal crush wounds. Former site manager, Daniel Reilly, who was employed by owners of the site, Spaces & Place Ltd said: 'When I went to the site the gates were open most of the time. The gates are closed at night time and the last person living ensures the gate is locked. 'I had previously opened the gate on occasion and experienced no problems. The gate has only had one previous problem to the best of my knowledge. This was in the winter when the gate was scraping along the floor and the issue was raised with my boss and it was repaired. They also replaced the fencing next to the gate and also fitted palisade fencing.' The inquest heard a new gate with more hinges which were larger had been fitted since Mrs Goldman's death. The owner of Spaces & Places Ltd, Timothy Churchill, who lives in Alderley Edge, and who has 21 brick units and storage containers in the business centre said: 'I would like to express my utmost sorrow over the occurrence of this tragic incident.' The inquest continues.","Myra Goldman, 68, was unlocking heavy gate alone to go to work .

"The pilot of a medical transport helicopter narrowly avoided a collision with an unmanned drone near a Pennsylvania airport on Wednesday, a hospital official said. A Life Flight helicopter was crossing over the Schuylkill County Joe Zerbey Airport, about 50 miles west of Allentown, when it nearly crossed paths with a drone flying in the same airspace. WBRE reports the drone was operating about 1000 feet above the ground at the time of the incident, though it did not describe how the helicopter evaded the unmanned aircraft. Near miss: A Life Flight pilot crossed over the Schuylkill County Joe Zerbey Airport and narrowly missed colliding with a drone . There were no patients aboard the helicopter at the time, a Geisinger Health System spokesperson told the station. The pilot of the helicopter reached out to drone enthusiast Lee DeAngelis to ask about protocol among operators of unmanned aircraft. 'His main concern used to be birds, now it's drones,' DeAngelis says about the Life Flight pilot involved in  the incident. DeAngelis posts videos shot using drones to Access Aerial, a site for fans of the technology. He says he 'self-regulates' to avoid incidents such as the one that happened Wednesday, steering clear of airports and speaking with authorities ahead of flights. Sky eye: Lee DeAngelis, a local drone enthusiast, says he avoids flying unmanned aircraft near airports out of concern for collisions with larger vehicles . The station reports the Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, but as for the helicopter pilot, DeAngelis says the close call hasn't turned him off drones for good. 'He likes the technology and thinks it could be used for good, he's just amazed at how quickly these things have shown up on his radar,' said DeAngelis.","The pilot of a medical transport helicopter narrowly avoided colliding with an unmanned drone near a Pennsylvania airport .

"Tourists are being urged not to leave padlocks on a Paris bridge to symbolise their love - and to take selfies instead. Officials in the French capital are cracking down on the gesture, which sees couples leave a 'love lock' on the Pont des Arts, and are advising couples to take photos to post on social media. The practice of attaching the inscribed padlocks has become so popular that part of the bridge over the Seine collapsed under their weight in June. Scroll down for video . Tourism officials are urging visitors to take photos instead of placing love locks on Paris's Pont des Arts . Sealing their love: Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick attached a padlock to the Pont des Arts when they visited Paris with their son Mason . No crossing: A wooden board covers a section of the bridge railing that collapsed under the weight of the padlocks . From . Monday, notices will be placed on bridges urging couples to take selfies . - and post them on social media with the hastag #lovewithoutlocks. A . city official told Le Parisien newspaper: 'There was no question of a . clampdown or penalising tourists who place padlocks, so we're proposing . that they use a ""social wall"" instead.' Tourists . have been evacuated from one of the most iconic bridges in Paris after . it began to crumble under the weight of thousands of 'love locks'. A . chunk of the Pont des Arts bridge fell away in June and the . police were called to seal off the area which remained closed for days. It . is a popular custom for tourists to secure a padlock to the bridge . branded with their names as a romantic gesture, with Kourtney Kardashian . and boyfriend Scott Disick also indulging in the tradition. Celebrity trend: Kourtney, pictured with Scott and son Mason, was captured on camera attaching the lock for TV show Keeping up with the Kardashians . In the family: Kim Kardashian and her mother Kris Jenner also stopped at Pont des Arts on a visit to Paris to attach a padlock to the bridge . Vying for space: There are now so many padlocks on the bridge that some tourists have taken to attaching theirs to lampposts too . Kim Kardashian has also been pictured attaching a lock to the bridge when she visited Paris while pregnant. But the weight of the locks is damaging . the metal Ponts des Arts, which was originally completed in 1804 but rebuilt in . the 1980s following damage in the two World Wars. A local French police spokesperson said of the collapse in June: 'A metal grille had fallen inwards, rather than into the river. 'If it had landed on a passing boat, the results could have been disastrous. As it happened, nobody was injured. 'The bridge was evacuated, and will now be closed until Monday morning at the earliest.' It follows growing calls for the padlocks - which also blight other major European cities including London - to be banned. The famous Paris bridge is said to offer some of the best views along the Seine . It was first built between 1802 and 1804, under the reign of Napoleon, and is a favourite with artists . Due to damage sustained in WW1 and WW2, the bridge was rebuilt between 1981 and 1984 . The 'love lock' tradition began in Hungary in the early 20th century, based on a tale of a woman who lost her soldier love to another during WW1. Young women started symbolising their love by attaching padlocks to the bridge where the abandoned woman used to meet her lost lover. The padlock tradition took hold in Western Europe in the early 2000s and was popularised by an Italian book I Want You by Federico Moccia, in which a couple adds a padlock to the Ponte Milvio in Rome. In Paris, the ritual began in 2008 on the Pont des Arts but has since extended to the Pont de l’Archevêché near Notre Dame too. Othe bridges encountering problems from a vast quantity of padlocks being affixed are the Ponte Vecchio in Florence and the Ponte l’Accademia in Venice. It has . become common practice for visitors to buy a padlock, attach it to a . bridge, and then throw the key into the river, in Paris's case the . Seine. The . practice has been encouraged by American celebrities including Kim . Kardashian and Kanye West, who spent a lot of time dating in Paris . before their wedding in Italy last month. The 'Not Love Locks' campaign was launched in Paris by two Americans in . February, in response to some 700,000 padlocks appearing around the . city. All . bridges have been blighted by the practice, but the Pont des Arts now . looks like two solid walls of metal divided by a wooden walkway. 'It's so out of control,' says Lisa Anselmo, who co-founded the campaign with fellow writer Lisa Taylor Huff. Love locks: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West also attached a padlock to the bridge when they were in Paris . Lookout point: The bridge is famed for its spectacular views along the Seine .

"This is the incredible moment more than 25,000 teddy bears rained down on the ice during a Calgary Hitmen hockey game in Canada. The toys were tossed from the stands as part of the the world-famous Teddy Bear Toss Hockey Game, in which the stuffed animals are collected and distributed to children's charities. The concept behind the festive tradition is that each spectator brings a teddy bear which they then throw onto the ice when the home team first scores. The annual Teddy Bear Toss is a seasonal tradition carried out by hockey clubs across North America, but the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League are the undisputed kings of the toss . When Ridal Fazleev scored at 1:38 of the first period in the game against the Moose Jaw Warriors, 25,214 teddy bears and other stuffed toys sailed down from the stands, almost covering the ice. It took nearly 40 minutes for the deluge of toys to be swept up and collected from the ice by seven trucks. The bears will now be distributed among 60 local children's charities.

"Wildlife selfie: Jack Gangwish, a 21-year-old defensive end for the University of Nebraska, grabbed a selfie with the critter . A college football player got bitten by a raccoon after stopping on a drive through rural Nebraska to take a selfie with it. Jack Gangwish, 21, a defensive end for the University of Nebraksa's Cornhuskers, spotted the 'soft and friendly' critter while driving near Lincoln, Nebraska, and stopped to take a picture with it. But seconds after he had taken the snap, the animal bit him on the calf - prompted a violent reaction from the 6'2"", 260lbs college junior, who killed it with a wrench. 'It was a raccoon selfie gone completely wrong', Gangwish explained to his local newspaper the Lincoln Journal Star. He took to the animal afterwards with a crescent wrench from his pick-up truck so that it can be tested for rabies - which could have been transmitted from the bite. Gangwich later tweeted to his followers: 'Guys… I got bit by a raccoon… It just looked so soft and friendly I couldnt [sic] help it!' He later joked about having rabies and posted a tweet declaring himself 'THE COON WHISPERER'. He later removed the messages. Experts recommend that any raccoon which bites a person should be 'humanley euthanized' so that its brain can be tested for signs of the infectious disease. Gangwish, who plays as number 95 for the Cornhuskers, has lived in rural Nebraska all his life, hailing from Wood River, a town of 1,300 in the center of the state. Revenge: The football player tweeted this picture of the bite the creature made on his leg - before he killed it with a wrench so the raccoon can be tested for rabies . His University of Nebraska biography describes the agricultural economics student as: 'a standout in the weight room throughout his career, adding more than 30 pounds of muscle since arriving on campus. 'Gangwish spent the majority of the spring working with the second unit at end and will have an opportunity to see action behind projected starters Randy Gregory and Greg McMullen. 'The walk-on from Wood River, Neb., has shown the relentless attitude to work his way into a position to contend for playing time.'

"This is the bizarre moment a woman dressed in black wrestled with a taxi driver which was parked across a busy road. In the video - which appeared on YouTube - the woman can clearly be heard shouting and gesturing at the driver of the black cab. About 25 seconds in, she can be seen leaning in to the car and grapples with the man, setting off the car's horn twice. Scroll down for video . The woman, dressed in black, approaches the taxi on South Road in Dundee that was parked across the road . As the woman tries to force her way in to the taxi, the driver reacts and shrugs her away . The woman refuses to back down and the struggle continues, forcing cars to swerve out of the way of the cab . The woman then tries to jump on top of the driver and sets off the car's horn twice . The driver fends off the woman again and she eventually walked off after the struggle which lasted a minute . In the extraordinary footage, the pair awkwardly struggle in the car seat for almost a minute before the woman walks away. In the background there is traffic chaos as cars are forced to drive round the vehicle, which is pulled over across one side of the road facing oncoming traffic. The incident took place on Dundee's South Road and was reported to police. A police spokesman said officers were making inquiries into the incident. Dougie Inglis, owner of Discovery Taxis said: 'The driver in the video works for us. Apparently this happened around ten weeks ago. 'The police have all the details. It should have already been dealt with. There are two dedicated police officers dealing with it.' Graeme Stephen, chairman of the Dundee Taxi Association, said: 'I don't know what happened in this case, but in general safety is a concern for taxi drivers. 'You're picking up lots of people — sometimes groups of them — and you're on your own. 'You don't know if they've taken alcohol or drugs, or whether they've just argued with their partner. 'A whole host of things could have upset them and the taxi driver gets the brunt of it. 'I find that it's helpful to have CCTV in the taxi.

"A man has been taken to a mental facility for evaluation after allegedly driving a car into a Ten Commandments monument in Oklahoma, smashing it to pieces, 'because Satan told him to do it'. Michael Reed Jr, 29, from Roland, Sequoyah County, is accused of deliberately running over the controversial six-foot structure outside the State Capitol building on Thursday night. He then reportedly showed up at a federal building in Oklahoma City on Friday morning, where he started rambling and making derogatory statements about President Barack Obama. These included threats to kill the President, as well as spitting on a photo of Obama, it is alleged. Destroyed: Michael Reed Jr, 29, has been arrested after allegedly driving a car into a Ten Commandments monument  in Oklahoma because 'Satan told him to do it'. Above, the structure, which was smashed to pieces . Reed Jr was quickly arrested by police and later admitted destroying the monument because he had been ordered to do so by Satan, U.S. Secret Service agent David Allison said. 'He claimed he got out of his car, urinated on the monument, and then ran over it and destroyed it,' Mr Allison said. 'He said Satan told him to do it, and that he was a Satanist.' Now, it has emerged that the suspect - who fled the scene following the alleged monument attack at around 9pm - has been taken to a mental facility in Oklahoma County for evaluation. Investigators are also looking at the possibility of filing criminal charges against Reed Jr, according to a news release from Oklahoma Highway Patrol Captain, George Brown. 'Investigators will continue to look into the case and coordinate with the Oklahoma County District Attorney on Monday, for any possible criminal charges,' said the release. On Saturday, Reed Jr's mother, Crystal Tucker, told Koco.com that her son would never have committed such an act of violence - particularly because he 'worships God, not Satan'. Before: Reed Jr is accused of deliberately running over the controversial six-foot structure outside the State Capitol building last night. Above, the widely disputed monument is pictured before the alleged attack . Workers at the scene of the crash: He then reportedly showed up at a federal building in Oklahoma City this morning, where he started rambling and making derogatory statements about President Barack Obama . 'He would never deface something that meant so much to him,' she said. 'He takes the Ten Commandments very seriously.' However, Mrs Tucker added that Reed Jr has been battling breakdowns for two years, saying: 'It all started after an injury at work four years ago. 'Now, when he has these breakdowns, the one thing that is foremost in his mind, his religion, is the thing he takes it out on.' The Ten Commandments monument, which has been a subject of great controversy since its creation in 2012, was built with the agreement of Oklahoma's Conservative Legislature. Removal: Reed Jr  admitted destroying the monument because he had been ordered to do so by Satan, U.S. Secret Service agent David Allison said. Above, workers remove the damaged remains of the monument . Mike Ritze, of Broken Arrow, whose family spent nearly $10,000 having the monument erected, said: 'We consider this an act of violence against the state of Oklahoma.' In a vow to have it rebuilt, he added: 'We are obviously shocked and dismayed, but we're not discouraged.' Meanwhile, Governor Mary Fallin called Reed Jr's alleged crime an 'appalling' act of vandalism and volunteered to help raise private funds to restore the structure. Over the past two years, the monument has been widely disputed, with The American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma suing to have it removed on the basis it violates the Oklahoma Constitution. The ACLU is carrying out legal action on behalf of a Norman minister and others who allege the monument's location violates the state constitutional ban on using public property to support 'any sect, church, denomination or system of religion.' A judge ruled last month that the monument does not violate the Oklahoma Constitution, and ACLU attorneys filed an appeal with the state Supreme Court. Ryan Kiesel, the ACLU of Oklahoma's executive director, said he and his clients were 'outraged' that the monument was vandalized. 'To see the Ten Commandments desecrated by vandals is highly offensive to them as people of faith,' Mr Kiesel said. President: Reed Jr allegedly threatened to kill Obama (pictured speaking in Tallinn, Estonia, this month) The monument's placement has led others to seek permission to erect their own monuments, including a satanic group that hopes to create a seven-foot statue of Satan. Other requests have been made from a Hindu leader in Nevada and the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Pieces of the monument were yesterday removed from the scene, while the vehicle Reed Jr was allegedly driving was impounded.","Michael Reed Jr allegedly drove car into Ten Commandments monument .

"Officials have confirmed that the . mummified remains of a woman found in the garage of a suburban Detroit . home in March were those of the lady who lived there alone. Authorities . this week notified the relatives of Pia Farrenkopf that she had been . positively identified using DNA testing, the Detroit Free Press reported. Oakland County Deputy Medical Examiner . Dr. Bernardino Pacris said the cause and manner of death could not be . determined because the body was mummified. Investigators . said in March that they believed the remains were Farrenkopf, a . self-employed financial trouble-shooter who would have turned 50 this . year. A message posted . Tuesday on a Facebook page set up by a relative said arrangements were . being made to lay Farrenkopf's remains to rest. Young and carefree: Pia Farrenkopf - seen here in a high school yearbook photo - is believed to have died in the garage of her home in Pontiac, Michigan, in 2008, however her body was only found in March 2014 . Her body was found in the rear seat of her Jeep, inside the garage of her Pontiac home. Officials . said she could have been dead for more than five years and that there . was no evidence of foul play. They sought help from dentists who may . have treated Farrenkopf, but couldn't secure the necessary records. Oakland . County authorities say Farrenkopf paid her mortgage and other bills . automatically through a checking account that once had a balance of . $54,000. The money ran out last year, and the Pontiac home went into . foreclosure. A contractor sent by the lender discovered the body. Farrenkopf, . who was single, traveled the world and had family in Massachusetts. Strangely her sister, Paula Logan, said she was not extranged from her incredibly private sister. She claims she repeatedly tried to get in touch with her, but yet did not go by her house. 'It's not like we were estranged.... My sister had died. I tried to get in touch with her,' Logan said. 'My mother passed, too. We tried to get in touch with her. The phone . just rang, rang, rang.' Logan said she last saw in 2007. Authorities believe she died in 2008. She said Farrenkopf, one of . 10 siblings from an Irish-Belgian family in the Boston area, typically . stayed in touch even while working or traveling in Germany, England, . Switzerland and Egypt. 'She was energetic, bubbly, well-rounded - you know what I mean?' Logan said. 'She had plenty of money. She had . stocks, insurance. That house was a minute part of what she owned.' Logan said she asked police in Pontiac to go to Farrenkopf's home, but couldn't recall the date. 'They said they did a wellness check and didn't see anything wrong,' Logan said. Pontiac . has been patrolled by the county sheriff's office since summer 2011. A . message seeking comment was not immediately returned Tuesday. Logan doesn't believe her sister would commit suicide. 'I think there was foul play. I think someone might have been in that garage,' she told WXYZ. Scene: Pia Farrenkompf's mummified body was found in the garage of her Pontiac, Michigan home (pictured) Discovery: The woman's body was found when a contractor went into the home because it was going into foreclosure . Farrenkopf's devastated nephew Eric Logan said the news has shocked the family. 'It kills us to read that maybe nobody . cared for her,' he said. 'It's completely opposite. All of us are just . devastated. ... We have been looking for her. We've done everything we . could do, shy of us kicking the door ourselves.' Farrenkopf's niece Mickelann LeBlanc Burke - just a few years younger than her aunt - shared her grief in a public Facebook post. 'Pia . was loved by our entire family and was never forgotten! Please keep in . mind that every family has their own dynamic, function or dysfunction. It is easy to rush to judgement not knowing, our family dynamic,' she . wrote. 'Our family had been . trying to contact Pia numerous times over the years and now we know why . our calls went unanswered ... We were all shocked and deeply saddened . when we heard about Pia. 'This . is a terrible tragedy and our hearts are broken. Devastated, knowing . she was alone in that garage all of these years! I hope in time we can . get some answers to what actually happened to Pia and lay her to . peaceful rest.' One of Farrenkopf's nieces has also set up a 'Mummified in Michigan' Facebook page in a bid to clarify reporting about the woman and to get information about what could have happened to her. Decay: Police had to done HAZMAT suits to enter the home, the interior of which was covered in a toxic black mold . Back seat: Farrenkopf was found mummified in the backseat of her Jeep (pictured) inside the garage of her Detroit home . Farrenkopf's remains were discovered when a bank contractor was sent to the home to . investigate a hole in the roof after it went into foreclosure in March . 2013. Farrenkopf's payments . for her mortgage, utilities and other bills were automatically . deducted from her bank account which at one time contained $54,000. The . money finally ran out, leading to the grim discovery of the woman's . mummified body lying on the back seat of a Jeep Liberty registered to . Farrenkopf inside the garage. Undersheriff . Mike McCabe told Detroit Free Press that investigators believe the . woman has been dead since at least 2008. That’s the year the license . plate on Farrenkopf's Jeep expired. The body was clothed in a heavy . jacket and jeans, leading investigators to believe that it was winter . when she died. The key was in the ignition, but it was switched to the . off position. Investigators . are treating the death as a homicide at this time and say suicide by . carbon monoxide seems unlikely. The body shows no signs of trauma, . McCabe says. Dr . Bernadino Pacris, the Oakland County deputy medical examiner, said the . skin was intact on the corpse, but the internal organs had decomposed. Climate, weather and humidity play a role in preserving a body in such a way, he said. Unpaid bills: Mail for Pia Farrenkopf on the snowy driveway to the home she once owned . Neighbors of Farrenkopf's on Savanna St said they never noticed anything amiss. The woman lived alone and kept to herself, often disappearing for days or weeks on business. According . to the Detroit News, Farrenkopf was a contractor with Chrysler's . financing division before her employment was terminated in September . 2008. Logan said that the Chrysler job had been the reason for her sister's move from Massachusetts to Detroit. Neighbor Darryl Tillery, 49, said the woman’s mail never piled up at the house and her lawn was kept neat. 'It was pretty manicured,' he told the Detroit Free Press. 'There was no indication there was a body in there, at all.' Strange: Neighbor Darryl Tillery said Farrenkopf's mail never piled up at the house and her lawn was kept neat . Some believed they no longer saw Farrenkopf because she had moved to Germany, something she had indicated that she intended to do. Many left the area after the economy crashed in 2009 wand they could no longer afford their mortgage payments. The outside of the home was fairly well maintained, but inside a black mold had taken over, McCabe said. WXYZ reported that Farrenkopf's stepfather Edward Caroll, said she was estranged from her family. Caroll married Farrenkopf’s mother three years ago. He said Pia Farrenkopf never answered the wedding invitation. 'I tried to find her through the Internet and everything and I never could find her.  And I wrote a letter a couple times and I think some of them came back. Her mother hadn’t heard from her for years and years.'

"Calls to the NHS's non-emergency 111 phoneline are to be screened for possible Ebola sufferers, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has announced. Call centre workers are to question anyone phoning with possible symptoms of the disease about their recent travel history to see if they have been to west Africa - where the death toll has passed 4,000 people. Symptoms of the deadly virus include respiratory problems, high temperatures, or diarrhoea and vomiting. Scroll down for video . Yesterday NHS staff across the country took part in drills in which actors played suspected Ebola sufferers . The NHS 111 service is a free one-step number for patients with urgent, but not life-threatening symptoms. The phone line, which has 46 different centres across the country, operates 24-hours a day, seven days a week. It receives one million calls every month. Mr Hunt said that the UK had 'robust and well-tested systems for dealing with any imported case of Ebola', but added: 'However, we keep the need for further measures under review and will never be complacent.' He said: 'Now all call handlers on the NHS 111 service are asking anyone reporting potential symptoms of Ebola, such as respiratory problems, high temperatures, or diarrhoea and vomiting, about their recent travel history, so appropriate help can be given to people who might be at higher risk of having come into contact with the virus. 'If the person with symptoms has recently been to west Africa and is at high risk of having been in contact with Ebola, 111 will immediately refer them to local emergency services for assessment by ambulance personnel with appropriate protective equipment. 'The NHS and Public Health England are well prepared for Ebola, and I am determined to make sure that we continue to do everything we can to protect the public, based on the best medical advice.' One actor is treated by a paramedic  wearing bio-hazard suits and mask as he is transferred to hospital . In this exercise, an actor visited a walk-in health centre in Hillingdon, pictured, to report flu-like symptoms. He told workers that he had recently been travelling in west Africa . Meanwhile, thousands of NHS workers are planning to walk out of hospitals on Monday as they strike over pay. The industrial action will see picket lines mounted outside hospitals and ambulance stations across England for four hours from 7am. Mr Hunt's announcement comes one day after NHS staff carried out show drills ordered by the Prime Minister to practise diagnosing and treating suspected Ebola cases. The exercises, which took place at health centres and hospitals across the UK, came amid growing fears that the deadly virus could strike here - and spread. Pictures of the exercises showed medics clad head-to-toe in sealed plastic bio-protection suits, medics wheeling stricken 'patients' - played by actors - into an NHS hospital. The space-age medical outfits – similar to those used in West Africa, where 4,000 people have already died from the disease – protect them from direct contact with the patient. An NHS staff worker wears a full-body protective suit to wheel the actor into quarantine in Newcastle. Calls to the non-emergency 111 phoneline will now be screen for suspected Ebola cases . Ebola, which kills up to 90 per cent of those it infects, is present in all bodily fluids – including tears, sweat and mucus – of those infected. The medics in the drill images wear special respirators that enable them to breathe filtered air. Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer for England, said the exercises ‘gave a very realistic test of how prepared the system is to deal with a case of ebola.' Last night she said the UK should expect ‘a handful’ of ebola cases in the coming months. She said: ‘The big problem is in West Africa where the doubling rate is every four weeks and it really is going up and up. So it will not be surprising if we have spill- over into this country. I would expect a handful of cases over the next few months.’ The only British citizen to have been infected with Ebola was nurse Will Pooley who survived despite catching the virus while working to help victims in Sierra Leone. Yesterday it was confirmed that a British man suspected of being the first UK citizen to die of Ebola did not have the deadly virus. Colin Jaffray, 58, from Royston, Cambridgeshire, was struck down with a fever, vomiting and internal bleeding during a business trip to Macedonia - and died in hospital on Thursday evening. Officials in Skopje say that although the cause of death was not known, it is thought that a drinking binge may have played a part in his death.","Calls to non-emergency line to be screened for possible Ebola sufferers .

"Two Silicon Valley companies will now cover egg-freezing as an incentive for top female talent in their prime fertility years who don't want to sacrifice motherhood for work. Apple and Facebook say they'll shell out out as much as $20,000 for women to put their parenthood plans on ice. The firms also hope the incentive will help women balance child-rearing and work life. However, even as success rates continue to rise, there are no guarantees the method will lead to conception down the road. Looking for female talent: Apple and Facebook say they'll shell out out as much as $20,000 for women to put their parenthood plans on ice . Facebook has already started covering the procedure, which can cost $10,000 or more plus annual storage fees, and Apple's program begins in January, according to NBC News. Apple's plan is covered as part of its fertility benefits while Facebook's will fall under its surrogacy benefit. While the move is sure to bring in gifted tech talent eager to have it all, experts warn that freezing eggs is no guarantee of a future family. Women inject high levels of hormones for a week in order to ovulate as many eggs as possible. Retrieving them is an outpatient procedure that can cost $10,000 to $15,000, sometimes not including the cost of the medication. Clinics also charge a storage fee, and then women who wind up using their eggs will pay thousands more to undergo in vitro fertilization. Anyone considering egg freezing needs careful counseling about their age and the odds of success if they want to later thaw those eggs for use in in vitro fertilization, the guidelines stress. Sperm routinely are frozen. So are the extra embryos of couples undergoing infertility treatment, in case they want to use them for later pregnancy attempts. But eggs proved more delicate and difficult to freeze than sperm or embryos. The problem: Eggs contain lots of water, and early methods of freezing and thawing allowed ice crystals to form that could destroy or damage them. In the past decade, scientists created a flash-freezing method called vitrification that appears to overcome that challenge. For a number of years, egg-freezing has been offered experimentally for young women or girls who are diagnosed with cancer or other serious illnesses that would destroy their ovaries. Then there's age-related infertility: About 1 in 5 U.S. women now have their first child after age 35, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet the ability to conceive begins dropping around 35 and more rapidly as the 40s near. Women have fewer eggs left, and these older remaining ones aren't as healthy, meaning even if the woman can get pregnant she's more likely to miscarry. There are only about 1,500 known live births resulting from frozen eggs worldwide, compared with about 1 million IVF births using fresh eggs.","The male-dominated Silicon Valley giants are hoping it will help attract top female talent .
Both companies will cover the costs up to $20,000 .
Many women will successfully become mothers using the method but there are no guarantees ."
"Military officials are trying to calm widespread fears stoked Tuesday when news broke that dozens of the 4,000 American troops being deployed to Ebola-ravaged Liberia could risk direct exposure as they test lab samples for the deadly virus. 'I am confident we can ensure our service members’ safety and the safety of the American people,' assured U.S. Army General David Rodriguez. Meanwhile, the Pentagon went on to announce Wednesday that even more soldiers are being deployed to West Africa. On their way: A picture released by the USMC on Thursday shows US Marines and Sailors assigned to Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force-Crisis Response-Africa prepare to deploy to West Africa in support of Operation United Assistance . Sending more: One hundred Marines will go to Liberia on Thursday with helicopters and other transportation to help the military get to locations around the country and help with the Ebola fight. This probably will be a temporary assignment, and the Marines will remain until soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, arrive . One hundred Marines will go to Liberia on Thursday with helicopters and other transportation to help the military get to locations around the country and help with the Ebola fight. The Pentagon press secretary, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, says the Marines are part of a special air-ground task force out of Spain. He says this probably will be a temporary assignment, and the Marines will remain until soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, arrive. About two dozen U.S. military specialists deploying to Liberia will test laboratory samples for Ebola, but most of the nearly 4,000 troops due to go are not expected to be in direct contact with the virus, defense officials said Tuesday. General David Rodriguez, head of U.S. forces in Africa, said three mobile labs had deployed to Liberia and four more were being sought to run tests that would distinguish between people infected with Ebola and those who have diseases with similar symptoms, such as malaria. Ramping up: General David Rodriguez, head of U.S. forces in Africa, said three mobile labs had deployed to Liberia and four more were being sought to run tests that would distinguish between people infected with Ebola and those who have diseases with similar symptoms, such as malaria . Moving out: The 101st Airborne Division (pictured here in Afghanistan in 2013) are preparing to go to West Africa to assist in the Ebola crisis . Each lab would be staffed by a team of three to four experts trained to operate in the worst chemical, biological and nuclear environments, Rodriguez told reporters at a Pentagon briefing. The teams operate in full protective clothing. Ebola, which can cause fever, vomiting and diarrhea, spreads through contact with bodily fluids such as blood or saliva. The U.S. military is ramping up its response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where it has already killed more than 3,400 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Concern is growing that the virus could spread to other parts of the world. The United States has 348 military personnel in Liberia and Senegal working on combating the spread of Ebola. Rodriguez has been authorized to send some 3,900 troops if needed. He said at this point he expected the effort to last a year and did not think more troops would be necessary. 'We're going to stay as long as we're needed, but not longer,' said Rodriguez, who estimated the cost of the military operation at $750 million for the next six months. Many of the military personnel due to go to Liberia in the coming months are construction workers who will build up to 17 100-bed Ebola treatment facilities. Risk of exposure: U.S. military officials have announced that some two dozen specially-trained troops will have contact with the Ebola virus as they test laboratory samples for the dreaded virus in Liberia . Expanding response: U.S. Navy microbiologist Lt. Jimmy Regeimbal prepares to test blood samples for Ebola at the U.S. Navy mobile laboratory on October 7 near Gbarnga central Liberia. The U.S. now operates 4 mobile laboratories in Liberia as part of the American response to the Ebola epidemic and is expected to soon open more . Rodriguez said health officials estimated at least 70 percent of those diagnosed with the virus need to be in treatment facilities in order to slow the spread of the disease. Assistant Defense Secretary Andy Weber, who is responsible for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, said the Pentagon was working with international partners to ensure there are more beds than patients, aiming to contain the spread by isolating the patients. 'If you've seen the modeling from CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), it's on a fast rise. But we can turn it. We know what to do,' said Weber, who is leaving the Defense Department to become the deputy to the State Department's Ebola Coordinator, Ambassador Nancy Powell. 'Over half the people infected with Ebola can survive if they have just basic medical support,' he said. 'So we can get ahead of this, but right now we're playing catch-up because it really started to spread at an exponential rate in August.' Weber said the U.S. departments of Defense and Health and Human Services had been primary investors in the search for drugs, vaccines and diagnostic tools to counter the Ebola virus, including the promising experimental drug ZMapp produced by Mapp Biopharmaceutical. 'Ebola has always been on the threat list of agents that we're concerned about,' he said, noting that rare diseases like Ebola are 'not a commercial market so big pharma doesn't have an interest in pursuing these, which is why the government involvement is so important.'

"Police have released the chilling 911 call made after the mayor of a small Los Angeles suburb was fatally shot by his wife. In the recording, the sobbing 19-year-old son of the Bell Gardens Mayor Daniel Crespo, 45, all but begs the operator not to blame his mother in the domestic tragedy. 'It wasn't my mom's fault. She was defending herself,' cries Daniel Crespo Jr. Scroll down to listen to audio . Better times: A wailing 19-year-old Daniel Crespo Jr. (far right) called 911 September 30 after his mother shot his mayor father multiple times in the torso during a domestic altercation. A top right is Mrs. Levette Crespo with her daughter Chrystal at center . His mother, 43-year-old Levette Crespo, had been in a fight with her husband when their son tried to intervene, according to KTLA. The father and son dispute turned abusive, said Crespo Jr. And that's when Mrs. Crespo snapped. Police say she fired multiple times into her high school sweetheart husband's torso. 'My parents got in an argument and there were shots fired,' Crespo Jr. cried into the phone, in a call punctuated by several long silences from the victim's end. 'He hurt me. He hurt me,' Crespo Jr. said, as if in explanation. 'He's on the floor dying, OK? He hurt me.' As police arrived, the 911 call ended. Lawyer Eber Bayona said Lyvette Crespo has cooperated with authorities since the outset and was released after questioning. There has been no arrest and no criminal charges thus far. Domestic unrest: The Bell Gardens mayor was in an argument with his wife when his son reportedly interviewed. The two men then got into a physical fight . Levette Crespo's lawyer told reporters outside Bell Gardens City Hall that the stay-at-home mother, whom police questioned and released following the shooting on Tuesday, was a victim in the case along with her husband, Daniel Crespo. Police have not said who owned the gun. In addition to serving as mayor of Bell Gardens, Crespo worked as a Los Angeles County probation officer for over 20 years. Neighbors had never complained of arguments coming from the house, Daniel Crespo's friend Joaquin Madrigal, who met the mayor 25 years ago, told Reuters in an interview. 'It was a huge surprise,' he said in Spanish. 'We never thought anything would happen in his house.' Madrigal described Levette Crespo as quiet, serious and reserved, a woman who tried to keep herself and her children out of her husband's political world. A friend of Daniel Crespo said he was friendly and enjoyed karaoke to relieve the pressures of his job. 'It's very hard to picture what they're saying,' said Albert Bernal, who met Crespo during his 2000 campaign and was helping plan a vigil for the mayor on Friday evening. 'I just want justice for my brother,' the mayor's brother, William Crespo, said outside City Hall. 'It wasn't my mom's fault. She was defending herself': Crespo's 43-year-old wife shot her husband multiple times in the torso during the struggle. He later was pronounced dead at a hospital, but Mrs. Crespo faces no charges . Counterpoint: William Crespo, the mayor's brother, said allegations of physical abuse and cheating were a lie. He said he wants his sister-in-law to be charged with second-degree murder, adding that she knows how to use a gun. 'I think the evidence will corroborate she has been the victim of domestic violence for many years,' attorney Eber Bayona said. 'What happened Tuesday in the Crespo home is a tragedy. Everyone is a victim.' Claudia Osuna, an attorney for the couple's son and daughter, said the children stood behind their mother. Bayona added: 'In this case, there may be a chance to learn about the difficult and intolerable home life for this family.' It has also been reported that reported that Crespo may have kept one or more women on the side. The Los Angeles Times reported that 'law enforcement sources [...] said they had received information that Crespo had relationships with women besides his wife.'","The son of Daniel Crespo called 911 September 30 after his mother Levette Crespo shot the Bell Gardens mayor .

"Turner Broadcasting announced Monday plans to shed nearly 1,500 jobs worldwide, about 10 percent of the news and entertainment giant's employees. The layoffs include 300 workers getting the ax at CNN. Monday's announcement follows an offer of voluntary buyouts to 600 veteran employees in August, part of an overall cost-cutting effort at the Atlanta-based broadcasting company founded by Ted Turner. Turner said Monday that the restructuring includes cutting jobs, eliminating unfilled positions and voluntary departures. Axed: Turner Broadcasting announced Monday plans to shed nearly 1,500 jobs worldwide, about 10 percent of the news and entertainment giant's employees--including 300 at CNN . The reduction includes previously announced buyouts targeting 500 to 600 workers. Turner has about 14,000 full-time employees worldwide. The eliminations will affect 18 different locations and will come from its news, entertainment, sports, and business units as well as corporate positions. The job cuts 'will come at all levels from across the company's news, entertainment, kids, young adult and sports networks and businesses, as well as corporate functions in 18 Turner locations around the world,' Turner said in a statement. The company also plans to add about 150 new positions in areas of investment and growth. Turner's CNN division has struggled in recent years to find a programming strategy that will allow it to get and keep viewers as it competes with cable news rivals Fox News and MSNBC. And TNT and TBS, which once relied heavily on reruns of old broadcast shows to fill their schedules, are under increased pressure to create more original programming. Turner Broadcasting System, which also owns The Cartoon Network, HLN, TruTV and Turner Classic Movies, is a unit of New York-based Time Warner Inc., the company behind HBO and Warner Bros. studios.

"A shocking tuberculosis outbreak in a Texas hospital has now hit home for three more terrorized homes after a nurse's assistant was allowed to continue working with newborns for weeks after she began showing symptoms of the disease. Eight babies have tested positive for TB following the August 21 discovery that a Providence Memorial Hospital nursery employee suffered from the active, highly contagious form of the disease, it was reported last week. The revelation that the El Paso nurse had reported symptoms as far back as July has now become all the more disturbing as authorities have raised the number of infants possibly exposed to 860. Shocking: Eight infants born at an El Paso, Texas hospital have tested positive for tuberculosis after a nursery employee worked with babies in the ward for weeks or more while extremely contagious (stock photo) The unidentified hospital employee worked at Providence Memorial Hospital in El Paso. She potentially exposed 860 babies to TB, it was revealed last week . The Mantoux test is a widely used test for latent TB and is used on both adults and children. It involves injecting a substance called PPD tuberculin into the skin of the forearm. If the patient has latent TB infection, their skin will be sensitive to PPD tuberculin and a hard red bump will develop at the site of the injection, usually within 48 to 72 hours of having the test. If they have a very strong skin reaction, they may need a chest X-ray to confirm whether they have an active TB infection. If they do not have a latent infection, their skin will not react to the Mantoux test. The infants who've tested positive all have a latent form of tuberculosis and have been offered treatment that will prevent them from becoming ill. El Paso Public Health Director Robert Resendes said Thursday that of the eight, five babies had been vaccinated previously against TB and their results may be false positives. The report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reveals that the nurse assistant on July 2 told others at Providence Memorial Hospital she was fatigued and coughing up blood. However, she didn't stop working until after her Aug. 15 shift and her private doctor diagnosed her with the active form of the disease on Aug. 21. Dozens of the potentially infected babies came from nearby New Mexico. The hospital worker may have also exposed  about 40 other hospital workers starting all the way back in September 2013, said Dr. Hector Ocaranza, the health authority for El Paso County. Ocaranza didn't say how the nursery worker may have contracted the disease, citing privacy laws. Employment and medical records were reviewed to determine which infants and hospital workers may have been exposed. Ocaranza noted that TB is treatable and said the possible exposure at the hospital doesn't represent a public health threat. The discovery of the infected employee also prompted an inspection of the hospital by regulators, who found several violations that could threaten the hospital's Medicare funding and posed 'an immediate jeopardy to patient safety,' said David Wright, deputy regional administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Wright declined to specify the violations, saying only that they were in the areas of infection control, patient rights and management oversight. He also declined to say if the violations were related to the TB exposure. As of October, The hospital says it passed the first inspection by federal health authorities and inspectors will return in December. Bacterial scourge: The bacterial infection is spread through the air when someone sick with TB coughs or sneezes. The infected person must have the active form of the disease in order to be contagious . Tuberculosis was a major killer of humans and scourge to societies dating back to ancient Egypt. The potentially deadly disease of the lungs still rears its head today, so what should you know about TB? Ancient scourge: An x-ray of a human chest reveals pulmonary tuberculosis . Q: How is TB transmitted? A: People with active TB, which travels through the air, can transmit the bacteria when they cough, sneeze or even speak. TB is unique because it remains airborne for prolonged periods of time, unlike the flu virus, which travels in droplets of fluid expelled from the body, according to David Dowdy, an epidemiology professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. But the illness is hard to catch. Dowdy noted that it can only be spread by someone with active TB. Lee B. Richman, founder of the New Jersey Medical School Global Tuberculosis Institute in Newark, said TB also requires prolonged exposure. Q: What are the symptoms and how is TB treated? A: Symptoms of active TB include muscle weakness and general sickness, weight loss, fever and night sweats. TB also usually includes coughing, chest pain or coughing up blood. People infected with TB are given a four-drug treatment over 6 to 12 months. People who stop treatment or don't take the medication as prescribed may become sick again and cause the bacteria to become resistant to the drugs, creating a far more deadly microbe that is much harder to treat. Q: How prevalent is TB in the U.S.? A: Last year, nearly 9,600 cases of active TB were reported in the U.S., and about 65 percent of those cases were among people born outside the U.S., according to the CDC. Most people living in the U.S. and areas with access to good health care will not die from TB if treated, though drug-resistant TB is more deadly.","The nursery worker at Providence Memorial Hospital in El Paso reported symptoms in July but worked through August 15 .

"A Columbine-obsessed Pennsylvania teen accused of stabbing 21 people at his high school in April was has been refused admission to up to eight Pittsburgh-area psychiatric hospitals, a rep for his family said. A judge revealed on Tuesday the most recent hospital did so out of safety concerns. Alex Hribal, who was 16 at the time of the stabbings, has been held in juvenile detention since he was arrested on April 9 at Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville, Pennsylvania. Nowhere to go: A psychologist hired by the family of a teen accused of injuring 21 in a stabbing spree at his Pittsburgh school says the boy has been turned away by up to eight psych hospitals . He is accused of slashing students and staff with two 8-inch kitchen knives. Westmoreland County Judge Christopher Feliciani on Friday granted a defense request to transfer the teenager to a psychiatric facility, and planned to send him to Southwood Psychiatric Hospital in Pittsburgh. Southwood subsequently said it was unable to accommodate Hribal, according to a statement issued by the judge. 'Southwood has security concerns,' Feliciani said in the statement. 'Counsel for defendant is investigating other options. If a facility is approved, the defendant will be transferred. The court order remains in effect,' Feliciani said. Officials at Southwood said that due to privacy laws, they were unable to provide further information about their reasons for rejecting Hribal. Before Southwood's decision, seven or eight other mental health facilities denied admission to the teenager, said Bruce Chambers, a forensic psychologist hired by Hribal's defense team to evaluate him. 'Because of the high-profile nature of the case and some of the misconceptions of his mental illness, some places are not wanting to take him,' said Chambers, who is in private practice in Cranberry, Pennsylvania. 'Security concerns': Alex Hribal, who was 16 at the time of the stabbings, has been held in juvenile detention since he was arrested on April 9.

'Now that he has a court order ordering him to treatment maybe a few of these other facilities will accept him.' Chambers testified on Friday that 16-year-old Alex Hribal planned the stabbing for April 20, the 15th anniversary of the massacre, but school was out that day. His attorney, Patrick Thomassey, doesn't dispute that Hribal brought two eight-inch kitchen knives from his home and attacked others before classes began that morning. But Thomassey maintains the boy has deep-seated mental health issues that would be better addressed in juvenile court. Bloody spree: His attorney, Patrick Thomassey, doesn't dispute that Hribal brought two eight-inch kitchen knives from his home and attacked others before classes began that April morning . Dark anniversary: Hribal's psychologist testified on Friday that 16-year-old Alex Hribal planned the stabbing for April 20, the 15th anniversary of the massacre, but school was out that day . Thomassey has said he plans to ask a judge to move the case from Common Pleas to juvenile court, where the judge would be able to incarcerate or supervise Hribal only until he's 21. If he's convicted as an adult, he would likely face decades in prison. Prosecutors are expected to argue that Hribal should continue to be treated as an adult. Hribal's trial had been scheduled to begin October 6, but was postponed indefinitely to resolve some legal issues.

"A Wednesday morning bomb threat has led to the evacuation of the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut and early dismissal of all students. Monroe Police Lt. Brian McCauley says the threat was called in to the school at 9:30 a.m. and the evacuation was ordered as a precaution. He says the school building and grounds were checked and no evidence of danger was found. Scroll down for video . Sick: A Wednesday morning bomb threat has led to the evacuation of the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Students went home early from the school in Monroe, which has temporarily served Newtown students since their school was razed after the 2012 massacre . Nancy Bartosik of the Monroe superintendent's office says the school was dismissed early and students moved to a nearby school to be picked up by their parents. 'Sandy Hook will dismiss at noontime because of a low to no threat scare,' Newtown Superintendent of Schools Dr. Joseph V. Erardi Jr. told parents in a recorded statement, according to WFSB. 'All students are safe, all staff are safe, everyone is absolutely fine,' it said. The scare is being investigated, the message said. The former Chalk Hill Middle School in Monroe, Connecticut was repurposed for use by Sandy Hook students after their school in Newtown became the backdrop for America's most horrific school shooting to date in 2012. Erardi planned a meeting for 7pm at Sandy hook high where parents could air questions and concerns over the day's events and the school's response. A gunman killed 20 first-grade students and six educators at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December 2012. The students resumed classes in a school in the neighboring town of Monroe, also called Sandy Hook Elementary School. The original school building was torn down last year.

"Second DUI arrest: Record-breaking multiple Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps was arrested Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence . Michael Phelps had been on an eight-hour gambling session before being pulled over on suspicion of DUI, it has been claimed. Reports have emerged that the record-breaking multiple Olympic gold medalist had been at a casino in Baltimore, Maryland, in the hours before he was stopped by police in the same city. The revelation comes after Phelps tweeted an apology following his early morning arrest, saying he was 'deeply sorry'. The website tmz.com has reported that the 29-year-old had been at the Horseshoe Casino, arriving at around 5pm on Monday afternoon. He sat in a VIP gambling room for hours before leaving at about 1am, a casino source told the website. MailOnline approached the swimmer's representatives for a comment this morning but has yet to receive a response. It was after 1:30am when Maryland Transit Authority police pulled over Phelps' Land Rover, just past a toll plaza near the Fort McHenry Tunnel on I-395 - a few miles from the casino. It was the athlete's second DUI arrest. In 2004, at the age of 19, he was arrested for DUI and received 18 months probation. On Tuesday afternoon, the Olympian tweeted: 'I know these words may not mean much right now but I am deeply sorry to everyone I have let down. I understand the severity of my actions and take full responsibility.' After pulling Phelps over, police initiated a field sobriety test, which he reportedly failed spectacularly and had nearly twice the legal B.A.C. 'He was unable to perform satisfactorily a series of standard field sobriety tests,' reads the MdTA statement. 'Mr. Phelps was cooperative throughout the process.' Phelps was arrested and taken to a transportation authority station, from which he was later released. The 22 gold medal winning athlete was charged with for driving 84MPH in a 45MPH zone, police told TMZ, and for crossing double lane lines. The last time news broke of Phelps' antics behind the wheel, it also took place in Maryland. In 2004, then 19-year-old Phelps was arrested near Salisbury University in the city of Salisbury and charged with DUI, DWI, violation of a license restriction and failure to obey a stop sign. As part of a plea deal, the rising sports star pleaded guilty to drunk driving and was sentenced to 18 months probation. Phelps apologized Tuesday afternoon--his second such apology. In 2004, at age 19, the swimmer was sentenced to 18 months probation after pleading guilty to driving drunk in Maryland's Eastern Shore . Phelps is the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time and has an astounding 22 medals from three Summer Games, including 18 gold. When he was last arrested for DUI, he announced 'I've learned from this mistake' He was also made to pay a $250 fine and ordered to pay  court costs of $55. 'I recognize the seriousness of this mistake,' Phelps told a judge in 2004 as 100 spectators looked on. 'I've learned from this mistake and will continue learning from this mistake for the rest of my life.' It didn't take long for fellow Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte to give the media his two cents on Phelps' arrest. 'He just makes dumb decisions,' Lochte told TMZ of his former teammate. 'He has so much money to get a driver. I even have a driver. Just stinks for the sport of swimming.' Ryan then pulled back a little, telling TMZ he's just glad everyone involved is unharmed. 'He will become smarter from this. Luckily he did not hurt himself or someone else,' Lochte said. After winning 18 gold medals, two silver and two bronze medals at Olympics in Athens, Beijing and London, Phelps announced his retirement following the 2012 Olympics. Phelps announced his plans to come out of retirement and return to professional competition at age 28 in April 2014. Talking about poker in an interview with cardplayer.com in 2008, Phelps said: 'I love to play, it's fun, it's exciting,' adding that he was not drawn to the game for its competitive aspect, but more as an opportunity to unwind. 'It was more something so that I could have time to myself,' he said. 'I could relax, I could be myself, and I could have fun. It’s a place where I can be me.' In 2009, a British tabloid published a photo of Phelps using a marijuana pipe in South Carolina a few months earlier. A sheriff said there wasn't evidence to charge Phelps with a crime, but he agreed to the suspension by USA Swimming. Sponsor Kellogg Co. dropped him almost immediately, while Subway stayed with him.

"Second DUI arrest: Record-breaking multiple Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps was arrested Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence . Michael Phelps has tweeted an apology after news broke Tuesday of his early morning arrest on suspicion of DUI. 'I know these words may not mean much right now but I am deeply sorry to everyone I have let down,' wrote the record-breaking multiple Olympic gold medalist Tuesday afternoon. 'I understand the severity of my actions and take full responsibility.' The arrest took place in Baltimore City, Maryland, the 29-year-old's home state and was the athlete's second DUI arrest. Phelps was arrested in 2004 at age 19 for DUI and later received 18 months probation. It was after 1:30 when Maryland Transit Authority police pulled over Phelps' Land Rover, just past a toll plaza near the Fort McHenry Tunnel on I-395. They initiated a field sobriety test, which he reportedly failed spectacularly and had nearly twice the legal B.A.C. 'He was unable to perform satisfactorily a series of standard field sobriety tests,' reads the MdTA statement. 'Mr. Phelps was cooperative throughout the process.' Phelps was arrested and taken to a transportation authority station, from which he was later released.

"The Mexican government began airlifting the first of thousands of stranded tourists out of the hurricane and looting-ravaged celebrity-frequented beach town of Los Cabos on Tuesday, as residents picked up the pieces of shattered, flooded homes. The Interior Ministry said military and commercial planes were carrying travelers out through the Los Cabos international airport, which remained closed to commercial flights due to damage suffered when Hurricane Odile tore through the area late Sunday and Monday. Images on Mexican television showed the terminal full of debris, but Ministry official Jose Maria Tapia told Milenio Television earlier that the runway was usable and work was nearly complete to make the control tower operable. Travelers were being flown free of charge to airports in Tijuana, Mazatlan, Guadalajara and Mexico City to catch connecting flights and, in the case of foreigners, receive consular assistance.

Free of charge: Travelers were being flown free of charge to airports in Tijuana, Mazatlan, Guadalajara and Mexico City to catch connecting flights and, in the case of foreigners, receive consular assistance . Priorities: President Enrique Pena Nieto was scheduled to tour the area later in the day and oversee evacuations, after presiding over an independence day military parade in the capital . Safe to fly? Images on Mexican television showed the terminal full of debris, but Ministry official Jose Maria Tapia told Milenio Television earlier that the runway was usable and work was nearly complete to make the control tower operable . A boat was on its way to Baja California Sur with humanitarian aid, and authorities were working to restore electricity and phone service. President Enrique Pena Nieto was scheduled to tour the area later in the day and oversee evacuations, after presiding over an independence day military parade in the capital. Downgraded to a tropical storm, Odile continued to soak parts of the Baja California Peninsula, and forecasters said it was still capable of unleashing dangerous flash floods and mudslides. In Los Cabos, Enrique Cota wept as he stood in murky, ankle-deep water and surveyed the destruction at his home. On the kitchen wall, a muddy mark nearly waist-high showed how deep the floodwaters got. 'We'll have to start over, little by little,' Cota said, 'because the stove, the refrigerator, the television, the kid's computer — it's all ruined.' He rode out Odile's landfall in a shelter with firefighters, and said he hadn't slept for two days. Dreams into nightmares: Authorities said about 30,000 tourists, 26,000 of them foreigners, were being put up in temporary refuges or hotel areas converted to shelters . Close to disaster: Thousands of others were evacuated from areas at risk of flooding as the NHC said rainfall in some areas could reach as much as 18 inches through Friday .

Authorities said about 30,000 tourists, 26,000 of them foreigners, were being put up in temporary refuges or hotel areas converted to shelters. Luis Felipe Puente, national coordinator for Civil Protection, said the airlift would prioritize the elderly and people with health problems. For some, it was a dream vacation turned nightmare. Charly Park, 52, flew in from Los Angeles with his wife on Sunday, but they never even got to check into their room. Instead, they were put directly into the hotel shelter where they spent a hot, cramped night as the hurricane raged outside. Tourists in shelters or hiding in bathtubs in their rooms posted photos overnight on social media showing windows barricaded with furniture after they were blown out. 'It's a horrible experience, no air conditioning, no fans ... the power lines all fell down,' Park said. He was considering renting a car to drive to Tijuana, a little over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) to the north, and cross the border back into California.

But surprisingly for a hurricane of this intensity — it made landfall as a monster Category 3 storm — there were no reports so far of fatalities directly related to Odile. Odile tore down scores of electricity towers, water tanks, air conditioning units and smashed storefronts across Cabo San Lucas, sparking looting. Pharmacies, electronics shops and convenience stores were among businesses hit by looters before police restored order on streets strewn with shattered glass from broken windows, said local shop worker Cristina Osuna, 31. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that by Tuesday afternoon Tropical Storm Odile had maximum sustained winds near 50 mph (85 kph). It was centered about 15 miles (25 kilometers) southeast of Bahia de Los Angeles, Mexico, and was moving to the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 kph). Farther south in the Pacific, Tropical Storm Polo formed off southern Mexico early Tuesday. It was centered 275 miles (440 kilometers) south of Acapulco with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), and was moving northwest parallel to the coast at 12 mph (19 kph). The hurricane center predicted that Polo could become a hurricane later in the week. Meanwhile in the central Atlantic, Hurricane Edouard strengthened to a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds near 115 mph (185 kph). It was forecast to pose no threat to land.

"The Federal Aviation Administration has launched a security review at Air Traffic Control facilities after a deliberate blaze in Chicago caused serious flight disruption which is set to last for two weeks. The incident on Friday was caused when an employee set fire to a room containing communications equipment at an Air Traffic Control center in Chicago. By Monday, O'Hare International was only back to 60 per cent capacity while Midway International Airport was running at 75 per cent. Scroll down for video . Still waiting: The FAA revealed Sunday that it's set an October 13 goal for restoring all the flights that were delayed or canceled after an O'Hare control room was sabotage by a suicidal employee on Friday . Michael Huerta of the FAA said a review into what happened has been launched and he wants a report on his desk within 30 days. He said: 'If we need to make changes because of the incident that happened in Chicago on Friday I will not hesitate to do so.' He added that new rule and background checks on people working in ATC centers may need to be introduced. Experts believe that the passengers will continue to face delays at O'Hare until October 13 at the earliest. That's the 'target' date the FAA has set for fully restoring service at the Chicago airport and allaying the inevitable nationwide ripple effect of having a major travel hub so crippled. Some 2,100 flights were canceled at major airports across the country on Friday after FAA telecom contractor set a fire in a basement before slashing his own throat and arms in a suicide attempt. Chaos: Some 4,000 flights were grounded by the sabotage as of Sunday and more issues were expected to stretch into the weeks ahead . On Saturday, the resulting air control chaos caused another 1,100 flight cancellations nationwide. Sunday saw 700 grounded flights. Howard, 36, of Naperville, who had access to the control center in suburban Aurora via a swipe card, entered around 5 a.m. Friday, and about 30 minutes later posted a suicide note on Facebook, according to a federal criminal complaint. Minutes later, someone at the facility called 911 to report the fire. A relative who saw the Facebook post also alerted authorities. Paramedics followed a trail of blood past a gas can, two knives and a lighter and found the suspect slashing his throat, the complaint said. He also had cuts to his arms. Howard was charged with a federal felony count of destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities, prosecutors said. 'Our team is on site working 24/7 with the (FAA) to install new equipment and restore service to full capacity as quickly as possible,' Harris spokesman Jim Burke said in a statement. Howard worked for eight years as a Harris field technician, and was terminated after the incident. O'Hare, one of the world's busiest airports, is the largest hub of United Airlines and a major hub for American Airlines. The airport averaged about 2,700 flights a day in August with a daily average of about 220,000 passengers in the month, according to its website. The FAA said that air traffic controllers who normally work at the Aurora facility are now working at other surrounding FAA facilities to help maximize traffic flow in and out of Chicago-area airports while repairs are being made. The FAA said on Saturday that it had decided to completely replace the central communications network in a different part of the same building to restore the system as quickly as possible. The first shipment of replacement equipment is scheduled to arrive late on Sunday night, and teams will be working around the clock to install it, the FAA said. Ripple effect: O'Hare, one of the world's busiest airports, is the largest hub of United Airlines and a major hub for American Airlines .

"Deeply regretful: Brian Howard is accused of setting a fire in an O'Hare air traffic control center before trying to kill himself. He expressed his remorse through his attorney on Monday . A man accused of setting fire to an air control facility in Chicago on Friday, causing an outage that continues to disrupt flights, appeared in federal court on Monday to hear the charges against him and was ordered held without bond. Brian Howard, 36, of the Chicago suburb of Naperville, appeared in the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Illinois and was charged with damaging an air navigation facility, interfering with its operations and endangering the safety of aircraft in flight. He did not enter a plea, but through his attorney said 'he deeply regrets' his actions. For many insiders, who see just how devastating his alleged actions were to air traffic controllers, his regret may not be enough. 'This is the biggest challenge we have faced in the national airspace system since the tragedy of 9/11,' Paul Rinaldi, president of the air traffic controllers union, told NBC News. 'We're going back to manually inputting routes, and you have a very large chunk of airspace that is not being controlled by anybody, and we're re-routing airplanes around this airspace.' Howard, a telecommunications contractor at the control center for eight years, tried to kill himself with a knife at the center on Friday when he sabotaged the facility, according to the criminal complaint against him. He was released from hospital on Monday morning and appeared in court with a bandage around his neck. 'He made a tragic mistake in the course of trying to end his own life,' his defense attorney, Ron Safer, told reporters after the hearing. 'Brian tried to take his life,' Safer told reports, including the Chicago Tribune. 'That he did so in a way that inconvenienced … many, many people is unacceptable and he deeply regrets that.' Court appearance: Howard, 36, (right) appeared in court for the first time on Monday after allegedly setting a fire that left regional and national air traffic snarled for days. Police say the FAA contractor slit his wrists and his own throat after setting the fire. A court sketch appears to show his neck bandaged . The center controls aircraft flying above 5,000 feet over a large part of the central United States. The sabotage on Friday affected more than 3,000 flights. Howard was disgruntled because he had been told he was being transferred to Hawaii, according to the criminal complaint. He posted a Facebook message early on Friday saying he was going to take his life. Friends who saw the message alerted the police. Cancellations and delays continued on Monday at Chicago airports, with 300 canceled flights at O'Hare International Airport, according to Chicago's Department of Aviation. The U.S. aviation safety agency's top official said on Monday he has asked for a review of all U.S. air traffic control contingency plans and security policies following the incident. Speaking at an industry conference, Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Michael Huerta said the agency won't hesitate to make changes in security policies if needed. Huerta, in his first public comments since the incident, said 20 of 29 pieces of communications equipment were damaged by the fire and were still being replaced. Lingering effects: Cancellations and delays continued on Monday at Chicago airports, with 300 canceled flights at O'Hare International Airport, according to Chicago's Department of Aviation. The fire's effects are expected to linger through half of October . Air traffic control at Chicago's O'Hare airport was brought to its knees after Brian Howard allegedly set a fire in a control center basement Friday. As the regional and even nationwide effects linger on, what should you know about the situation and about your own travel plans? Q: How many flights have been canceled? The U.S. aviation safety agency's top official said on Monday he has asked for a review of all U.S. air traffic control contingency plans and security policies following the incident . A: Since Friday morning, more than 3,700 flights have been canceled at O'Hare Airport, the nation's second-largest airport by passengers, and Midway Airport, the nation's 21st largest. Q: Which airlines have been hardest hit? A: United Airlines and its regional partners canceled 1,579 flights, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.com. American Airlines and its regional carriers canceled 1,415 flights, Southwest Airlines 601 flights and Delta Air Lines 46 flights. Q: How did airlines decide which flights to scrap? A: The vast majority of flights canceled by American, Delta and United were on their regional partner airlines. Those jets, which fly to smaller cities, typically carry 50 or 75 passengers, compared with the 150 or 200 on larger planes. Yet they still require the same amount of work for controllers. Q: So did this just affect Chicago? A: No. As planes fly across the country at high altitudes, they are handed off from one regional control center to another. There are 21 such facilities. The one in Aurora covers 91,000 square miles of airspace over five states and hundreds of airports. Q: What did the FAA do to keep planes flying? A: Responsibility for any air traffic flying above 18,000 feet in that region has been split up among the four neighboring air traffic control centers in Minneapolis, Kansas City, Cleveland and Indianapolis. Further, the FAA is redirecting transcontinental flights around Chicago's airspace. Q: What about flights to the Chicago area? A: Traffic below 18,000 feet is being handled by 19 regional facilities, which hand off approaching flights to the individual airport control towers for clearance to land. Q: If the FAA was able to create such a backup system, why were so many flights canceled? A: First, it took some time to get the plan in place. Next, there was a problem sharing data between the various control centers. Since the fire took out telecommunications, there was no easy way to exchange flight data between Chicago and the four neighboring centers. The FAA was typing in flight-plan information for each plane and printing it out on a strip. To safely manage that process, the number of planes in the sky had to be reduced. The government has since been able to automate much of the process, significantly improving the number of planes that can be handled. Q: What are delays like now? A: The FAA said Monday that the takeoff and landing rate at O'Hare was at 80 percent of the rate last week at the same time. Midway's rate was at more than 90 percent of the prior week's rate. Luckily for the airlines and passengers, the area has experienced mostly calm weather, with no severe thunderstorms that could further slow flights. Q: When are operations expected to get back to normal? A: The FAA says it will have the Aurora center open on Oct. 13. Q: Why will it take two weeks to fix the problem? A: First, crews are cleaning the area damaged by the fire, making sure the building is safe. Other crews are reconfiguring space on a different floor to house new equipment. The work involves replacing 20 of 29 racks of fiber-optic cables and other telecommunications equipment and re-establishing more than 600 circuits, ""so it's a very, very large job,"" FAA Administrator Michael P. Huerta said. Q: In light of the fire, will the FAA change how it operates and secures these facilities? A: Huerta said the agency might need to treat some buildings, like the center in Aurora, differently because they are more critical to the national air traffic system than others. Over the next 30 days, the FAA will conduct a review of its contingency plans for unexpected events like Friday's fire, as well as security at its facilities. United Airlines and its regional partners were reportedly the hardest hit canceling 1,579 flights, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.com. American Airlines and its regional carriers canceled 1,415 flights, Southwest Airlines 601 flights and Delta Air Lines 46 flights.","Brian Howard, 36, spoke through his attorney in court Monday to express his remorse .

Vargas . says the pipe has to be turned off slowly to avoid more damage. Normal . water flow through the pipes is 75,000 gallons per minute, reports NBC Los Angeles. City officials say the pipe that was laid down in 1921 carries water from a reservoir in the San Fernando Valley. The cause of the break hasn't been determined. Local . television images showed students wading through knee-deep water as the . geyser continued to pour water onto nearby Sunset Boulevard. Firefighters placed sandbags outside of classrooms and aided drivers stuck in water and mud. 'The . Number 1 thing is to keep hundreds of students from wandering into the . water where they could get swept off their feet,' Humphrey said. Standing water: Students stand among flood waters on UCLA's campus as water flows from a broken thirty inch water main gushing water onto Sunset Boulevard . But despite the water flooding their campus, UCLA students were making the most of the unusual situation by wading through the water .

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said in a statement that several crews are on the scene shutting down valves and being careful not to cause more breaks. Sunset, a major thoroughfare through the city's west side, was shut down in both directions, jamming traffic during the afternoon rush-hour commute. The city's Department of Water said workers were working to shut down multiple valves that would stop the water from flowing from the 30-inch main without breaking any nearby pipes. The water main break poured thousands of gallons of water onto the UCLA campus and nearby streets as California suffers through a record drought that has prompted state and local authorities to impose water-use restrictions on residents. Pushing water: The process of cleaning up UCLA began before the pipe was even shut off and will likely continue for months . The Pauley Pavilion sports area was covered in water after the main ruptured flooding the UCLA campus . Staff quickly got to work and weren't afraid to get their hands dirty as water spewed into the athletic center . Workers try to clear water from the floor of Pauley Pavillion on the UCLA campus. The athletic facility recently underwent a multi-million dollar makeover .

"A veteran sheriff's deputy and father-of-four who was one of two officers gunned down in a shooting rampage that spanned 30 miles across California on Friday died exactly 26 years to the day that his own father, who was also killed in the line of fire. Michael Davis Jr., 42, was shot dead by a male and female couple who were on the run from killing another deputy in Sacramento earlier in the day. His death tragically mimicked that of his father, Michael Davis Sr., who was killed on the job on the same day in 1988. The incident started about 10.30am in the parking lot of the Motel 6 in Sacramento. Fateful: Michael Davis Jr., 42 (left), a sheriff's deputy of 15 years, was killed in a shooting on October 24 - the same day his father, Michael Davis Sr. (right) was also killed in the line of the duty in 1988 . Shooter: Marcelo Marquez, 34, of Salt Lake City, fled police but was eventually flushed out of a home he hid in for several hours using gas bombs. He and a female companion are now in custody . High alert:  Law enforcement officers stop to search cars as they left the area in response to an officer involved shooting on Friday, October 24, 2014 . Scene: Law enforcement officers in Auburn, Calif., in response to a shooting on Friday. Another officer was shot 30 miles away in Sacramento . Huge response: A suspect armed with a rifle left one Sacramento sheriff's deputy dead, a motorist gravely injured, and two Placer County sheriff's deputies wounded in a 30-mile crime spree . A pair of Placer County Deputy Sheriff's embrace after the suspect was arrested (left) while another assesses a bullet cartridge left at one of the scenes . Sacramento County Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, approached a suspicious-looking car, but the occupants immediately opened fire. He was shot in the forehead with an assault rifle at close range and did not have time to draw his weapon. He died in hospital. Oliver, a 15-year veteran of the department, was the first Sacramento County deputy killed since 2008. He left a wife and two daughters. After Oliver was shot, his partner fired at the attackers, who drove about a mile before attempting a carjacking. The attackers then stole a red Ford pickup from a gardener and fled to the Sierra Nevada foothills city of Auburn in neighboring Placer County, about 30 miles northeast of Sacramento. Tragic: Deputy Danny Oliver, a father and officer of 15 years, was the first officer to be shot, sparking a wide-spanning hunt for the killer that ended 30 miles away . Scene: Officer Oliver was shot dead in the car park of Hotel 66 in Sacramento (pictured) Unprovoked: The suspects immediately opened fire, police said . That is when officer Michael Davis Jr. and his partner spotted the car parked alongside the road. Both were shot with an AR-15-type assault weapon, Placer County sheriff's spokeswoman Dena Erwin said. Davis, who had been working in law enforcement since 1996 - the last 10 years a homicide investigator - died from his injuries. His partner Jeff Davis - no relation - a 17-year department veteran, was treated for a gunshot wound in the arm. Police suspect the shooter was 34-year-old Marcelo Marquez of Salt Lake City, who was being held on suspicion of two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of carjacking. A woman with him, 38-year-old Janelle Marquez Monroy, was in custody on suspicion of attempted murder and two counts of carjacking. Monroy was arrested at the scene where Davis was killed. Police found a handgun in her purse. Deputies finally used tear gas to flush Marquez from the basement of the home where he hid for several hours. Arrested: This is the man police believe was behind the rampage that claimed the lives of two officers. Marcelo Marquez was being held on suspicion of two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of carjacking . Emergency: A special agent with the California Department of Justice walks a student from the Discovery Montessori school to her parents after being on lock-down because a suspect in the multiple shootings of officers in Sacramento and Placer Counties . Evacuated: The area was placed on lock-down as police tried to flush out the suspect, who was hiding in a nearby house . Jail records contained no indications that either suspect had outstanding arrest warrants. Both were being held without bail. Initial court appearances were expected Tuesday. A search of Utah court records for Marquez shows a history of about 10 tickets and misdemeanor traffic offenses between 2003 and 2009. Those records list one speeding ticket for Monroy in 2009 and three small claims filings attempting to collect outstanding debts. The slaying of the deputies was the single deadliest day for California law enforcement since February 2013. In separate incidents that month, former Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner killed two law enforcement officers, and two Santa Cruz police detectives were shot and killed.","Michael Davis Jr., 42, a officer of 18 years and father-of-four, was shot dead in Auburn on Friday .

"Paula Deen's name will soon be proudly plastered on a new restaurant, despite many believing it had been dragged too far through the mud to return. The TV chef's comeback trail appears to be in full swing, and it's leading her to Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, where she will open the doors to 'Paula Deen's Kitchen' in the summer. A hub for tourists visiting Dolly Parton's 'Dollywood' theme park and the nearby Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Pigeon Forge draws about 10 million vacationers a year - and Deen hopes to cash in. Comeback? Paula Deen, pictured on February 23,  is launching a new restaurant as she strives to return to fame . The news comes after the Savannah, . Georgia, celebrity launched a new company, Paula Deen Ventures, to . manage her return to fame following her racism scandal last year. Earlier . this month, Deen, who lost many of her sponsorship deals after she . admitted to using racial slurs, announced the company was getting a . massive $75 million from a private investment firm. On . Wednesday, she said Paula Deen Ventures was pouring $20 million into . the 20,000-square-foot restaurant, which will be at The Island real . estate development. The restaurant is expected to open in late summer this year. The TV chef already operates The Lady & Sons in Savannah. Deen's . new company comprises Paula Deen Foods, Paula Deen Media, Paula Deen . Restaurants, Paula Deen Cookware and Paula Deen Home. Busy complex: 'Paula Deen's Kitchen' will be located at Pigeon Forge, pictured, a hub for tourists visiting Dolly Parton's 'Dollywood' theme park and the nearby Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which draws about 10 million vacationers a year . According . to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the private investment company, . Najafi Media, is an affiliate of Najafi Cos., which often chooses to . invest in enterprises that have run into trouble. Deen . lost four buffet restaurants in casinos operated by Caesars . Entertainment last year during the fallout from the controversy. It . also led to Deen's Food Network show being canceled and the loss of . dozens of product endorsements, including Smithfield Foods. After announcing Paula Deen Ventures . earlier this month, Deen made her first major public speech last Sunday, . and began maneuvering for a comeback. She turned a beachside cooking demonstration into a public apology for the racist comments that decimated her career last year. Lady: Deen already owns The Lady and Sons Restaurant, pictured, in Savannah, Georgia . The former Food Network star took the stage to prepare chicken and dumplings at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival, but before beginning asked the crowd if they minded if she talked about something serious for a moment. Without ever explicitly discussing . the allegations or comments she has admitted making, she said she was . glad to be back and that, 'I am not a quitter.' 'We . have come off of a very hard summer my family and I, my team, my . partners,' she said to a cheering crowd of several hundred fans. 'But . you know, I have heard on more than one occasion ... that I've never . apologized. So if anybody did not hear me apologize, I would like to . apologize to those who did not hear me.' In the saddle: Paula Deen gets a ride across stage from Food Network star Robert Irvine during a cooking demo at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival in Miami, Sunday, February 23 . Deen has mostly stayed out of the spotlight since then, even avoiding the Food Network's 20th anniversary party last October. But lately, she has made it clear she wants back. And Sunday's crowd seemed primed for it all, shouting out to her 'You don't need to apologize!' and 'We want you back, Paula!' 'Ya'll's cards and letters that I got, helped me get out of bed every day' she replied. Midway through the demo, Food Network star Robert Irvine joined Deen onstage. Before a roaring crowd, Irvine then got down on his hands and knees while Deen straddled his back and rode him across the stage, a reenactment of a gimmick they'd done during a previous festival. 'I'm back in the saddle!' she yelled to the crowd.","The celebrity chef will soon open the doors to 'Paula Deen's Kitchen' in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, next to Dolly Parton's 'Dollywood'

"The Sheriff leading the investigation . into the cinema shooting which happened after a row over texting has . told MailOnline there is no chance of a Stand Your Ground defence, . saying, ‘It was an empty movie theatre. If he was scared why didn’t he . move seats?’. Sheriff Chris . Nocco has completely dismissed shooter Curtis Reeves’ claims that he . gunned down Chad Oulson because he feared for his safety and said there . is no way he can use Florida’s controversial self-defence law. He . is convinced the retired cop, 71, simply lost his temper after married . father-of-one Oulson refused to stop texting and then threw a bag of . popcorn at his killer’s face. Scroll down for videos . Dismissed: Sheriff Chris Nocco doesn't buy Curtis Reeves' claim that he shot Chad Oulson in self defense . Charges: Reeves, wearing a green 'suicide smock' appears via video link at a hearing on Tuesday . Dedicated: Chad, pictured with wife Nicole and Lexy, two, was texting about the health of his daughter when he was shot dead. A source told MailOnline: 'Although she was only very slightly unwell, he was concerned to know how she was feeling' Reeves’ attorney Richard Escobar . suggested on Wednesday that his client was not hit with popcorn and was . actually attacked with another more dangerous 'dark object'. However . Sheriff Nocco has completely dismissed that idea, saying nothing else . was thrown and that Monday’s shooting is an open and shut case. Speaking . to MailOnline the Pasco County Sheriff said: ‘Stand Your Ground is a . hot topic in Florida. Even if you have a clear Stand Your Ground case . then you still have to work incredibly hard to prove that is valid. ‘So . from our perspective, if we think it is going to be used as a defense . we have to prove why it’s not relevant. We immediately brought in our . states attorney’s office to work with us after Monday’s shooting. ‘I . remember very clearly that we stood outside the movie theatre, got all . the detectives over and said, ""what do we think we’ve got here? Is this a . Stand Your Ground case?"" Everyone said, no way, this is not Stand Your . Ground. ‘One of the key . elements is that the theater was not packed so there was ample . opportunity for anybody to move their seat if they wanted to. ‘From our investigation it seems simply that the agitation of someone using their cell phone to text has caused this. All the evidence and witness statements we have point that way. ‘The . suspect was sitting there, they had an argument about texting, the . victim turned around, threw something, a shot is fired and the next . thing you know a man is dead.’ Support: Family and friends of Reeves attend his Tuesday morning hearing . Richard Escobar, the attorney for Reeves, talks to reporters after his client's first hearing . Another shot? Nocco said Reeves may have been planning to shoot again but his gun was jammed. But added that it is not relevant to the investigation . Former Tampa Bay police captain Reeves was in the Wesley Chapel theater with his wife Vivian watching ‘Lone Survivor’ when he asked Oulson to stop using his phone. Oulson, . 43 – who was with his wife Nicole – was texting the babysitter looking . after his two-year-old daughter Lexy and he refused to stop. Reeves . went out to get a manager, came back alone and continued the row. Nocco . explained: ‘We believe the manager didn’t have a full conversation with . the individual because he was dealing with other customers. ‘But the fact the suspect had the ability to go and see the manager, shows he had the ability to move his seat.’ Soon after the row restarted, Oulson threw a bag of popcorn in Reeves face and the older man drew a pistol from his pocket. Nicole . Oulson desperately tried to shield her husband, but Reeves fired his . weapon and the bullet passed through her outstretched hand and hit . Oulson in the chest. Reeves . then placed the gun on his thigh and calmly sat down, before being . restrained by an off-duty deputy. His gun was jammed when it was . recovered and investigators are not sure whether he tried to fire a . second time. Sheriff Nocco said: ‘After he shot his weapon he put it down. It was jammed when he put it down on his thigh. ‘I . can’t tell you if he was trying to shoot again, or what he was doing. We will look at the gun to see what happened In the future, but that . isn’t relevant to the second degree murder charge at present.’ Today . Richard Escobar was quoted as saying something more than popcorn was . thrown. He told The Tampa Bay Times: ‘If it was popcorn, don't you think . the detective would have written popcorn? It's an unknown object, dark . in color. Those facts will come out.’ But Nocco hit back: ‘There is absolutely nothing to prove anything else was thrown.’ Since . the shooting a couple, Jamira and Michael Dixon have said they had a . run in with Reeves in the same cinema back in December after they used . their cell phone. Senseless killing: Nicole Oulson was shot in the hand and Chad Oulson shot fatally in the chest . Sheriff Nocco says they are looking into the claims and they could help the case against father-of-two Reeves. He . said: ‘Other people are now saying this happened to them. We are . currently trying to verify those statements, using credit card . statements to make sure they were definitely at the movies when they . said they were. If we can verify that then it gives us even more to go . on.’ Devastated Nicole . was released from hospital on Monday evening. She had surgery on her . hand on Wednesday and has now returned to the family home in Land O . Lakes. Over the past few days a steady stream of relatives have arrived . at the property to look after her and Lexy. The . family has said very little since the tragedy, but Chad Oulson’s sister . Kip Hoosier did talk to The Quincy Herald Whig, based in her home state . of Illinois, earlier this week. Describing her brother, she said: ‘He loved to have fun. He was a joker, a kidder. He smiled and laughed all the time. ‘He . works in a motorcycle shop. He was an avid motorcycle rider, a dirtbike . rider, but he gave that up when his wife got pregnant with their baby . to be a father and not be so daring with his life.’ Describing . the terrible moment Nicole broke the news to Chad’s mother, Kip said: . ‘It happened at 1 p.m. Nicole was on the phone with my mom before a . quarter after. She wasn’t at the hospital. She was still at the theater. ‘It was completely senseless, just a sad situation. We haven’t even dealt with the reality of it yet.’ Her brother’s killer is currently being held in Land O’ Lakes jail after he was denied bail at a court hearing on Tuesday. He . appeared before Circuit Judge Lynn Tepper in Pasco County via video . conference, standing at a podium wearing an olive-colored padded vest . and handcuffs. Grim task: Pasco Sheriff Chris Nocco, front, walks out to update reporters after an argument between patrons over texting sparked a shooting that left one person dead and another injured today . Richard Escobar told the court that . Reeves has close ties to the community, posed no danger to residents and . was no threat to flee. Later, outside the courtroom, Escobar told reporters his client was 'heartbroken' that a life was lost in the shooting. Reeves . served in the Navy and the Navy Reserves before joining the Tampa . Police Department in 1966, where he was a commander for around 17 years. He also worked as a homicide detective, property crimes detective and . instructor. He retired . in 1993 as captain. Tampa police told CNN that he was instrumental in . establishing the department's first Tactical Response Team - also known . as SWAT. Throughout his career, he consistently received good evaluations, praising his work ethic and leadership. A . 1992 evaluation states: 'Capt. Reeves is highly adept at recognizing . potential problems and utilizing available information to achieve . positive results. He is frequently called upon to develop and implement . department-wide programs concerning firearms and civil disorder.' He . also worked on several high-profile security details, including those . of presidential candidate Ross Perot, Vice President Dan Quayle, . President Ronald Reagan, Vice President George H.W. Bush and Bill . Clinton. He was rarely . criticized, but in 1971, his supervisors said he needed to make a 'marked improvement' after he demonstrated a 'get-by attitude'. Tragedy: Police tape surrounds the Cobb Grove 16 movie theater in Wesley Chapel, Florida, January 13 after the shooting over text messaging . Suspected Florida movie theater shooter Curtis Reeves was led away in handcuffs wearing a white jumpsuit after police removed his clothing for evidence. A 911 call released today revealed he had watched as his alleged victim died from a gunshot wound . Heated argument: The former cop and the victim argued before Reeves shot Oulson in the chest, killing him . In 1979 an evaluation cited problems with his temperament. It stated: 'His demeanor is generally very professional. He has, however, occasionally allowed his temper to detrimentally affect his manner of dealing with his supervisors.' Following . his retirement, he served as director of security for Busch Gardens . Tampa until 2005. WFLA has reported that the keen hunter served as . president of the Hernando County Crime Stoppers program from 2006 to . 2007. He has been married to his wife, Vivian, since 1967 and as well as . son Matthew, they have a daughter called Jennifer and one grandchild. Chad’s . former colleagues at Sky Power Sports have set up a Facebook page to . raise money for Nicole and Lexy.

"A Death Row prisoner's choice of final meal can show how guilty or innocent they feel, a study has shown. Researchers in the United States found that those who believe they have been 'hard done by' eat less food, or even avoid the meal altogether. Those who have accepted guilt, meanwhile, ask for a third more calories in their meal on average. Researchers have found that a Death Row prisoner's choice of last meal could indicate how guilty they feel . The researchers proved their hypothesis – that those who felt innocent would eat less – correct after analysing the final meals of 247 prisoners between 2002 and 2006. They found that those who denied guilt were 2.7 times more likely to decline a meal than those who had admitted their crimes. They also showed that prisoners who had accepted guilt, either by apologising or confessing, asked for 34 per cent more calories of food – and were more likely to request a brand name or comfort foods. While there are many factors that could contribute to prisoners' choices, it is thought that the final meals could tell researchers something about the degree of guilt, and could also be applied to anti-obesity research. Kevin Kniffin, of Cornell University, said: ‘The growing macabre fascination with ""last meals"" offers a window into one's true consumption desires when one's value of the future is discounted close to zero. ‘But in contrast to popular anecdotes and individual case studies, we created an empirical catalog of actual last meals - the final food requests of 247 individuals executed in the United States during a recent five-year period.' This photograph shows a death chamber in Raleigh, North Carolina . He added: ‘Our content analyses reveal three key findings: [Firstly], the average last meal is calorically rich (2756 calories) and proportionally averages 2.5 times the daily recommended servings of protein and fat. ‘[Secondly], the most frequent requests are also calorie dense: meat (83.9 per cent), fried food (67.9 per cent), desserts (66.3 per cent), and soft drinks (60 per cent), and [thirdly] 39.9% requested branded foods or beverages. ‘Given that some people who are warned about the ill effects of obesity might counter-intuitively engage in unhealthy overconsumption, the findings also suggest further study relating to the artificial use of mortality salience in campaigns against obesity.’ Final meal requests in Florida range from salami sandwiches to Jack Daniel's whiskey . A Death Row prisoner's choice of last meal fascinates like few other requests and has been the subject of a number of research projects in recent years. Last year, artist Julie Green completed a 13-year project painting more than 500 Death Row final meals on to plates. They included everything from cigarettes to pizza and tubs of ice cream. The most commonly ordered meals were fast food from KFC and McDonald’s. Meanwhile, in October, the Orlando Sentinel explored the final meal choices of the Death Row inmates of Florida. Before Panhandle Killer Arthur Rutherford was put to death in 2006, he requested some foods true to his southern locale. A deep fried feast of fried catfish, fried green tomatoes, fried eggplant and hush puppies were laid out for him before his lethal injection. Rutherford washed it down with sweet tea. Clarence Hill, an attempted bank robber and police officer killer, asked for tacos. So did Angel Nieves Diaz, who murdered the owner of a Miami strip club while he and accomplices robbed it. Oba Chandler, who raped and murdered an Ohio woman and her two teen daughters after they asked him for directions in 1989, asked for salami sandwiches and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. John Spenkelink got a special treat at his 1979 execution. Not only was he the first in Florida to be put to death following the Supreme Court’s reinstatement of the death penalty, but he also got to split a flask of Jack Daniel's whiskey with the prison superintendent. Aileen Wuornos’ seven-man killing spree was immortalised in the 2003 film Monster, but her life came to an end the year before. She declined a last meal and instead drank just a cup of coffee nine hours before she was put to death. Taking the opposite route was Allen Lee Davis, who murdered a pregnant woman in 1982 along with her two young daughters. He chose to have a smorgasbord of lobster tail, fried potatoes, a half-pound of fried shrimp, six ounces of fried clam strips, half a loaf of garlic bread and 32 ounces of A&W root beer.","Researchers in the United States found that those who feel innocent or 'hard done by' eat less .

"The judge in the murder trial of Etan Patz today refused to release the man accused of killing the six-year-old after the prosecution reminded him of the brutal crime he confessed to. Pedro Hernandez, from New Jersey, appeared in court today, where his lawyer asked that he be released from jail immediately due to the slow-moving case and lack of evidence against his client. But the prosecution asked that this request be denied, reminding the court: 'Let's remember he killed a six-year-old child.' Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley said that due to Hernandez's mental state, he would remain in prison until the trial, which is due to begin in Spring 2014. Killing: Pedro Hernandez, right, told police he was guilty of murdering missing child Etan Patz, left . Hernandez, who was led into the court handcuffed by police, said nothing during the short hearing. His lawyer Harvey Fishbein expressed . his frustration at the speed at which the case was moving, . referring to it as Groundhog Day, and accused the prosecution of dragging their feet while his client is languishing in jail, where he has been since May 2012. Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said prosecutors were moving as fast as they could. Fishbein has always maintained that Hernandez is schizophrenic and bipolar, and that his admission was . false, peppered with questionable claims and made after almost seven . hours of police questioning. Hernandez has entered a not guilty plea in the case. Etan vanished on May 25, 1979. The anniversary was later named National Missing Children's Day in his memory. He became one of the first vanished children pictured on a milk carton. Hernandez was arrested last May after . police got a tip that he'd told people years before that he had killed a . child in New York City. Iconic: Etan was one of the earliest missing children to make national headlines when he disappeared in 1979 . He then told authorities he'd seen . Etan at the bus stop, offered the boy a soda to entice him to a corner . store where he worked and choked the boy in the basement. Hernandez said he tossed Etan's book . bag behind a basement freezer, put his limp body in a box and left it . with some trash about a block away. No body or bag has ever been found. Under New York law, a person can be . convicted based only on a confession if there's additional evidence that . a crime was committed. 'The evidence before the grand jury .

"Attention, LeBron James, Kim Kardashian, Michele Obama and Beyonce: You, as well as dozens of other selfie-snapping celebs, have been put on notice by the recently formed SelfiePolice, which is now charging one dollar for each pompous portrait posted on social media websites. But self-centered celebs aren't the only targets of the Internet's new self-portrait patrol - anyone with a penchant for excessively posting selfies on the web could be hit with a one-dollar 'fine' from the group. But it gets even better - it's for a good cause. New Sheriff in Town: You may want to think twice before sharing that selfie on social media - you could be fined . On Notice: The group has targeted some of the most self-obsessed celebs as its 'most wanted' selfie offenders . The organization was formed by a group of students from Brigham Young University, and all of the profits from the 'fines' handed out for posting selfies online are donated to Vittana, a charitable organization that tries to fight world poverty by giving student loans to college-aged kids in third-world countries. The 'fines,' of course, aren't actual fines - they serve as an innovative way to ask for donations to a good cause by using one of the biggest phenomenons to hit the self-obsessed world of social media: The selfie. 'When we first came up with the idea we were trying to think of how to . engage our generation in giving,' co-creator Chas Barton tells the website petapixel.com. 'It’s . tricky because we’re such a selfish generation, so the question we asked . was not how do we make our generation charitable, but how do we turn . selfishness into charity. That’s where Selfie Police was born.' A good cause: The 'fines' the group collects go towards giving college loans to kids in third-world countries . The organization encourages people to 'accuse' their social media friends and family of selfie violations in one of three ways: Funny, snotty or mean. Anyone who goes the funny route will post 'OMG you are so beautiful! And nice! That’s why I knew you would pay up at selfiepolice.org #selfiepolice' underneath the offender's selfie. Those who choose snotty will post 'Thanks for that selfie I almost forgot what you looked like! Looks like you owe a dollar to the #selfiepolice selfiepolice.org.' Anyone who wants to get mean with their accusations are asked to post 'Eh, nice selfie. Use a better filter next time so I can’t actually tell what you look like. Pay up at selfiepolice.org #selfiepolice' under the self-centered photo. The URL address will direct offenders to the SelfiePolice website, where they are greeted with an explanatory message. Wanted: Kim Kardashian is one of the world's most notorious selfie offenders - and she's got the cash to pay a lot of 'fines' 'On behalf of humanity, you are hereby fined $1 per selfie on charges of self-obsession.

There’s a lot of work to be done. Together we can turn vanity into charity.' So far, the organization has raised a little more than $1,400.

"Americans are eating 23 pounds of cheese each a year - triple the amount consumed in 1970, according to a fascinating 'report card' on U.S. eating habits. The hefty serving of fromage, teamed with increased consumption of fats and oils has resulted in our overall calorific intake soaring 450 calories in the past 40 years to 2,535 a day, on average. Center for Science in the Public Interest researcher Bonnie Leibman said while there are some signs of improvement - we're cutting back on sugars, beef, whole milk and white flour - this is still not a report card to post on the fridge. Extra cheese: 'There's cheese in our salads, our sandwiches, our soups, and our pizza crust,' Liebman said . '(We're) eating more flour, more cheese, and more fats, with an extra shot of sugar thrown in,' she said. 'Bottom line? It's time to eat less - less red meat, less cheese, less starches, and less sweets. If Americans want straight As, they've got to do a little work.' The study entitled 'The Changing American Diet' shows fruit and vegetable consumption has barely budged since 1970 and Americans are still choosing red meat over white, though beef consumption is lower than it has been since the 1950s. We are eating 109 pounds of flour per year, thanks to the rise in corn flour. It's down from the 116 pound peak of 2000, right before low-carb craze began, but it's not far off. Cheese please: Americans are eating 23 pounds of cheese each a year - triple the amount consumed in 1970. Yogurt is also on the up, while full fat ice cream consumption has dropped, according to a fascinating 'report card' on U.S. eating habits . Sweet meat: Americans are still choosing red meat over white, though beef consumption is lower than it has been since the 1950s, as shown in the above graph . 'Breads, bagels, cereal, pasta, rice, crackers, granola bars, pizza, burritos, wraps, pretzels, paninis, cookies, scones, muffins, and other grain foods are still going gangbusters,' Leibman said. 'We need to switch to whole grains... and cut back on all grains.' She said the cheese frenzy showed no sign of slowing. 'There's cheese in our salads, our sandwiches, our soups, and our pizza crust,' she said. Calories: The hefty serving of fromage, teamed with increased consumption of fats and oils has resulted in our overall calorific intake soaring 450 calories in the past 40 years to 2,535 a day, on average . East your vegetables: The study entitled 'The Changing American Diet' shows fruit and vegetable consumption hasn't changed significantly since 1970 . 'Since 1970, we've gone from 8 pounds per person per year to 23 pounds. That's bad news for our arteries and waistlines.' On the positive side, we aren't reaching for the Ben & Jerry's quite so much. Full-fat ice cream is dipping and (mostly low-fat) yogurt is booming. However, the skim version is generally laden with sugar. Speaking . of sugar, we are consuming 78 pounds of sugar each a year - down from . the sugar high of 89 pounds per person in 1999 but still too much, . mostly as a result of sodas and other sweetened beverages that are . linked to obesity, diabetes and heart disease.","The hefty serving of cheese, teamed with increased consumption of fats and oils has resulted in our overall calorific intake soaring to 2,535 a day .

"Male fish are becoming part female at unusually high rates in three Pennsylvania rivers, sparking concerns the water is tainted with chemicals. Male smallmouth bass and white sucker fish carrying eggs in their testes were found in the Delaware, Ohio and Susquehanna rivers, according to research from the US Geological Survey. Researchers have linked the increasing number of intersex fish, or fish with two genders, to a 'complex mix of chemicals' flowing into waterways from nearby farms. Research: Intersex bass (with two genders) are turning up in polluted waterways in the Chesapeake Bay region . A sign of endocrine disruption: This magnification of a cross-section view of a smallmouth bass' testes shows immature eggs, which are round circles . 'I did not expect . to find it quite as widespread,' US Geological Survey . biologist Vicki Blazer told Washington Post. '(With the mutant bass) we keep . seeing... a correlation with the percent of agriculture in the . watershed where we conduct a study.' Scientists have discovered intersex bass in several areas . of the Potomac River, including near the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater . Treatment Plant, since 2003. Previous studies detected abnormal levels of chemicals such as herbicides, veterinary pharmaceuticals and manure from farms flowing into the nesting areas of the fish. These chemicals disrupt the endocrine system, throwing off functions which regulate hormones and the reproductive system. Location: Studies show a high level of chemicals from animal farms and human waste at bass nesting areas in the Potomac River . The Washington Post reported the problem extends beyond the Chesapeake Bay region, which includes Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia. US Geological Survey scientists found intersex bass in the Columbia, Colorado and Mississippi river basins in 2009. However scientists have yet to identify a single chemical responsible for altering a fish's sexual characteristics. A new Environmental Integrity Project report found there's a high incidence of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in the Chesapeake Bay, and tighter monitoring of fertilizers and other chemicals used at farms is necessary. 'Farmers should more carefully manage these manure and chemical fertilizers, and reduce them in areas where excessive amounts are being applied,' the report said. 'Bay states will need better monitoring data in small sub-watersheds dominated by agriculture to accurately track pollution from farms.' Last year, Democrats in the Maryland House and Senate sponsored a pair of bills requiring growers to submit records of their use of insecticides and herbicides to the state. Researchers welcomed the proposal, saying it would help focus research on chemical 'hot spots'. However the requirement was changed when growers said it would be a major financial burden. State lawmakers instead passed legislation to create a fund paying for mandatory pesticide reporting in the future. Meanwhile Blazer said the presence of intersex fish 'is an indicator that something . else is really wrong.' 'What are these things doing to the natural environment? If . we find these things in wild organisms, there’s a good chance they’re . also affecting people,' she told Washington Post.","New study shows male smallmouth bass and white sucker fish in 3 Pennsylvania rivers have eggs in their testes .

"When Hannah Carr's parents noticed a bruise on their baby's neck, they could never have imagined what was growing underneath it. The then-six-month-old from Hornsby in Sydney's north had a rare tumour the size of a tennis ball growing in the blood vessels of her neck. Her parents Amber and Peter were told it was a rare disease known as Kaposiform haemangioendothelioma (KHE) and just six other children were affected in Australia. Hannah Carr had a rare tumour the size of a tennis ball growing in the blood vessels of her neck when she was just six months old . 'When I first noticed it was the size of my thumbnail. I thought my husband was manhandling her – I told him to be more gentle when he was burping her,' Ms Carr told Daily Mail Australia. 'This bruise just didn't go away, I thought they normally clear up after a week.' Following tests at Westmead Children's Hospital, Hannah's family were told their daughter would have to endure 12 months worth of chemotherapy in a bid to tackle to tumour. 'I fell to the floor, my legs gave way (when) they told me it was a tumour,' Ms Carr said. 'The tumour grew overnight. I thought she was bleeding to death and it just kept getting bigger and bigger.' First signs of the tumour was a bruise the size of a thumbnail on Hannah's neck but it quickly doubled in size . Hannah's mother Amber thought her daughter was initially 'bleeding to death' after the tumor in the cells of her blood vessels left a horrific mark on her neck . Doctors planned to shrink Hannah's tumour with chemotherapy and subsequently cut it out, but when they did an MRI they realised it wasn't a solid mass. 'It has tentacles that spread across her chest, it goes across a lot of vital organs,' Ms Carr said. 'The chemo wasn't doing a lot, it was only slowly improving, so they added steroids as well. The side effects were awful. She blew up like a balloon and she was growling like a monster.' The tumour reduced by 50 percent after nine months on steroids and chemotherapy, but then stopped responding to treatment altogether. Doctors suggested a breakthrough treatment for transplant patients that had been used to treat this type of KHE cancer in America. As well as 12 months of chemotherapy, Hannah had to have nine months of steroids to help reduce the tumour - the side effects included weight gain (pictured) and mood changes . Hannah had a port inserted in straight into her chest so doctors could administer the chemotherapy . Doctors planned to shrink Hannah's tumour with chemotherapy and subsequently cut it out, but when they did an MRI they realised it wasn't a solid mass . 'She was the first kid in Australia to have this treatment,' Ms Carr said. 'It was absolutely scary. Doctors never said it was a life threatening thing - it wasn't like leukaemia when you had to pray they would wake up. 'But being so rare, it's scary because you don’t know how they’re going to react to the drug. She’s the first in Australia – who knows what side effects there are.' The cancer treatment came just three months after another devastating blow for the Carr family. Hannah spent the first three months of her life in hospital after being born 14 weeks prematurely. She was an identical twin but due to complications prior to birth, Hannah's sister Sophie was  stillborn.

Hannah, now aged three, is taking daily doses of drugs and has monthly blood tests. '(The tumour) is still there – but it’s back down the size of my thumb,' Ms Carr said.

"Misguided teen: Skylar Murphy, 18, brought a pipe bomb to Edmonton International Airport . It has been revealed the airport inspectors who permitted an 18-year-old man caught at Edmonton International Airport to board a plane tried to give the explosive device back to him. Skylar Murphy, from suburban Edmonton, was caught Sept 20 by security screeners with a pipe bomb. Despite a fuse at least nine-feet-long sticking out of one side. He made the bomb by taking gun powder stolen from bullets owned by an Alberta Sheriff set to marry his mother, according to the CBC. Authorities have said the man had no idea the bullets were stolen, he has been cleared of any wrongdoing. Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the judge in Mr Murphy's case say they believe him bringing the bomb to the airport was an accident based on how shocked he was in surveillance video, the CBC reported. The steel pipe bomb was filled with black powder and appeared to be functional. Airport Security inspectors first tried to return it to the teen before setting aside and neglecting to tell RCMP about it for four days, according to the CBC. Mr Murphy told officers when he was arrested that he planned to 'blow up a shed for fun,' according to a court transcript. The misguided teen received one year of probation, was order to pay $500 to the burn unit of a local hospital and also a $100 fine, according to the CBC. Black powder and a pipe bomb were found in Mr Murphy’s luggage by Canadian Air Transport Security Authority screeners, but they did not detain him or immediately alert authorities because they are not permitted to, according to a CATSA official. ‘Screening officers do not have the authority to apprehend or detain passengers,’ CATSA spokesman Mathieu Larocque told the CBC in a statement. ‘When they see something potentially illegal, the(y) contact the police.’ The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were not contacted until four days later, Mr Murphy was arrested when returned to Edmonton Sept 27. The lax approach to ensuring the safety of fliers infuriated the country’s top transportation official. ‘This individual should not have been allowed to board his flight, and it is unacceptable that CATSA waited four days before seeking the RCMP’s assistance,’ Transport Minister Lisa Raitt told the National Post. Mr Larocque declined to comment further about the incident, saying only that ‘for security reasons, I can’t go into details about our procedures at the checkpoint, which include our protocols with the police.’ 'A breakdown': A CATSA spokesperson told MailOnline there was a breakdown in security procedures - 'we should have called the police... we didn't' Mr Larocque separately admitted to MailOnline that was a procedural breakdown. 'We saw something unusual in his bag… we should have called the police right away, we didn’t.' A call to the RCMP’s Edmonton Airport detachment was shuffled to an airport spokesperson. The RCMP officer who answered the phone said Mounties are not publicly commenting on the incident. An airport spokesperson also declined to comment. A message left with the Crown Prosecutor's office was not returned. The lack of public comment on the incident has not gone unnoticed. ‘Everyone is dodging the bullet,’ a security expert told CTV. ‘No one wants to take responsibility for what is obviously a series of mistakes.’ Except for Mr Murphy, he pleaded guilty last month to possession of an explosive substance. Edmonton is the eighth busiest airport in Canada with just over one million passengers per year.","Skylar Murphy was caught Sept 20 with a pipe bomb at Edmonton International Airport .

"Chris Robshaw insists England are better prepared than two years ago when they pulled off a shock victory over the All Blacks at Twickenham that ended the tourists’ 20-game winning streak. England were less than a year into Stuart Lancaster’s tenure as head coach when they shocked the world champions with a stunning 38-21 win and, despite a raft of injuries ahead of Saturday’s showdown, Robshaw believes his side are much improved. ‘I think we have come a long way since then,’ said the England captain. ‘We were a side that was very defence-orientated and we prided ourselves on that defence. We probably won a lot of games because of that. Chris Ashton dives over to score for England during their famous win over New Zealand in 2012 . England captain Chris Robshaw talks to the media at England's Pennyhill Park training base on Wednesday . ‘I think we have come a long way since then,’ said the England captain. ‘We were a side that was very defence-orientated and we prided ourselves on that defence. We probably won a lot of games because of that. ‘Our attack has now caught up with that. Now we can play both sides. We can threaten with our attack and have that dominant defence as well. ‘The experience and composure of the guys has come on a long way. There were a lot of single-figure caps back then. Guys have now been round the world and played in some intimidating arenas, and excelled there.’ Robshaw also sent out a warning to his team-mates saying there will be 'no hiding places' against New Zealand. He added: 'There's no hiding place. We're not going into this game to come out second best. You can't stand off these guys for a second. It's about us putting our game out there. 'You have to defend extremely well and take your chances - there is no magic formula to beating them. 'In the pressure of the situation it's about who is able to do that and keep their composure. It's about being clinical. Robshaw is all smiles in training as England's forwards practice their scrummaging . 'In international rugby you know you're going to get a couple of chances, but in international rugby, when everything is flying around, are we good enough to take our chances? 'As an England squad that's the next step we need to take if we really want to push ourselves up there. 'We need to be as clinical as these guys coming to town this weekend. They are the benchmark of world rugby. Playing them is a great way to kick-start the autumn.' Lancaster will name his side on Thursday with uncapped Fijian-born wing Semesa Rokoduguni expected to be named alongside a midfield containing Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt.

"Risk: Agony aunt Irma Kurtz faced a backlash over her latest advice ¿ saying women should not get drunk around men because it puts them at risk of being raped . For four decades she has imparted wisdom to millions of women. But agony aunt Irma Kurtz yesterday faced a backlash over her latest advice – saying women should not get drunk around men because it puts them at risk of being raped. Miss Kurtz, who has worked as an agony aunt at Cosmopolitan magazine since 1973, claimed that the onus was on women to protect themselves against attack. She said those who ‘get drunk with the boys’ become incapable of defending themselves because ‘drunkenness tears that away. It really is carelessness to lose your self-defence’. She called rape ‘an assault with a weapon’, adding: ‘You really have to be a little bit defensive when you’re around people who are stupid and armed.’ The 78-year-old’s pronouncement was seized upon by anti-rape campaigners, who labelled her advice ‘totally irresponsible’ and called it ‘misguided, unhelpful and judgmental’. She made the comments in an interview with BBC presenter Jane Garvey on Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour yesterday morning. Miss Garvey asked Miss Kurtz about views she expressed some years ago, when she said women’s sexual freedom came with an obligation to protect themselves. Miss Garvey quoted Miss Kurtz’s words: ‘Please remember that your new freedom to go out and play with the boys requires you to employ an even greater freedom new to women, the greatest freedom ... the freedom to take responsibility  for ourselves.’ Asked by Miss Garvey if she meant that rape was the fault of the victim, Miss Kurtz said: ‘Rape is a vicious and wicked crime. It’s an assault with a weapon. It’s not the fault of the victim. However it’s a very good idea to keep away, to protect yourself. ‘What I’m saying actually is not that it is her fault. But please protect yourself, now that you’re allowed to, by not getting drunk with the boys.’ Miss Garvey retorted that just because women get drunk, it doesn’t mean they should become victims of rape, in the same way that men shouldn’t become rapists if they drink too much. Miss Kurtz replied: ‘No, and I couldn’t agree more if you’re saying that nor should men become rapists because they can get drunk. That’s absurd. It’s like saying someone’s got to shoot someone because he’s got a gun. ‘However, the woman is responsible for herself. Men and women are not quite the same. If a woman had a weapon she could use when she got drunk, I would tell her not to, of course. Strong words: Miss Kutz said those who 'get drunk with the boys' become incapable of defending themselves (posed by models) ‘But what she does have that she can use is self-defence. And drunkenness tears that away. It really is carelessness to lose your self-defence. You really have to be a little bit defensive when you’re around people who are stupid and armed.’ Miss Kurtz’s comments were last night condemned by anti-rape organisations, who said women often did not fight back during sexual assault in order to survive. Lisa Longstaff, of Women Against Rape, said: ‘Her comments are totally irresponsible. It is time commentators stopped blaming victims and put the responsibility on those who do the crime – rapists. 'It is carelessness to lose your self defence' ‘Many women do not fight back out of fear or as a survival technique – they can suffer even more injury by physically fighting back.’ Karen Ingala Smith, chief executive of campaign group NIA, which acts to reduce violence against women, added: ‘Whoever the rapist, whatever the circumstances, the state of intoxication of the victim is irrelevant. Rapists are the only ones responsible for rape. Every time. ‘Most – but not all – victims of sexual  violence and abuse are stone-cold sober when they are abused. Those who are drunk or intoxicated through drug use are no more deserving of abuse and no less deserving of support.’ Born in New Jersey in 1935, Miss Kurtz is the daughter of a dentist. She studied at Columbia University, graduating with a degree in English literature. After travelling around Europe, she lived in Paris for a short time before settling in London. She initially worked as a journalist for 1960s magazine Nova, before joining Cosmopolitan as agony aunt in 1973. A regular on Radio 4, she has written three self-help books, two novels and three travel books. She has never married, but has a son from a relationship in the 1970s. She is releasing her memoirs, My Life In Agony, next month.","Irma Kurtz says the onus is on women to protect themselves .

Here, she can be seen as Johnny Depp's character in Dark Shadows . After finishing school she applied to Limerick Art College, however Maria ended up turning down her place. She explains: 'I felt at the time that there wasn’t anywhere for me to go with what I wanted to do, I didn’t want to be a standard artist. I loved special effects, particularly body and face art. 'I went to find out about it but there was literally nowhere in Limerick or Ireland that specialised in that kind up of make up art.' Feeling frustrated she decided to move to London. Within three weeks she met her husband and together they have opened a line of cafe’s in the city.

"A property tycoon whose wife left him for Cesc Fabregas said today that British courts 'favour badly behaved women' after a judge refused to halt the sale of his £5.5million flat to the footballer as part of the divorce settlement. Elie Taktouk, 38, whose former wife, . Daniella Semaan, gave birth to Fabregas' baby in April, tried to block . the sale on the basis that the Barcelona star's offer was £2million less than . its true value. However a judge ruled last month the family home, a Grade-II listed Belgravia flat, just yards from Buckingham Palace, should be sold as part of divorce proceedings. Mr Taktouk told The Evening Standard: 'They [the courts] are not interested if you are right or wrong, they are just trying to protect the woman, they protect the badly behaved ones, not the well behaved ones who are dedicated to their work, family or life – they don’t get anything. 'It’s a gross injustice that the system has done and will continue to do with everyone.' Mr Taktouk said the court system allowed the footballer to buy the flat for £2million below what he says is its true £7.5million valuation. After the sale to Fabregas was approved by the High Court, Mr Taktouk launched a last-ditch bid for time to look for a bid closer to his valuation but Lord Justice Floyd at the Court of Appeal threw out his application to block the sale. Mr Taktouk said today while he respects . the court system, he criticised the family courts and said his case . should be a 'wake-up call' to other men. Miss . Semaan told the court she will not be able to stay in the flat when it . is signed over to her boyfriend as Fabregas will use it as an . 'investment'. Mr Taktouk said Fabregas (left), with Miss Semaan, paid £2million less for the Belgravia flat than it is worth . A view of the central London street where the flat at the centre of the dispute is situated. Miss Semaan said she will not be able to live in the flat after it is sold to Fabregas as he will rent it out . In a statement read out in court, she said: 'If the property is sold to Mr Fabregas, it is my understanding that it will be used as an investment and rented out in order to cover the cost of the purchase, and/or generate some income.' Mr Taktouk's barrister, Stephen Lyon, had told the court that other parties were willing to pay closer to £7.5million for the apartment. But, . rejecting his case, the appeal judge said encouraging more offers would . be a breach of the contract of sale already agreed with Fabregas, and . that, while unsold, the £4.8 million mortgage is accruing interest of . £1,000-a-day. Mr Taktouk had not objected to a sale of the flat to his mother, Mary Taktouk, for a price similar to that being offered by the footballer, he continued. Mr Taktouk previously objected to having to shell out for a home for his ex-wife as her new boyfriend Cesc Fabregas (pictured together), who is thought to earn £5m-a-year, has millions to lavish on he . Mr Taktouk and his ex-wife married when they were 24 and living in Lebanon. They had two children before their separation in 2011, months after Miss Semaan was seen on holiday with the 25-year-old footballer. Mr Taktouk had previously objected to having to shell out for a home for his ex-wife in circumstances where her new boyfriend, who is thought to earn £5m-a-year, has millions to lavish on her. In a court hearing in April, he claimed she had significantly under-stated the financial support she would get from Fabregas. She said his only obligation was to support their child and all she got was the price of flights, presents and being looked after when she is in Spain. Her evidence led family judge, Mr Justice Coleridge, to rule that the flat be sold. The proceeds, with a top-up from Mr Taktouk, would provide her with the £1.4m she needed to find a home of her own.","Elie Taktouk said his case should be a warning to other men .

"The year's first colchicums bring a blend of joy and sadness. Joy because the mauve-pink flowers are so fresh and beautiful; sadness because their arrival marks the beginning of summer's demise. Colchicums look like crocuses, but they buck the trend by flowering now instead of in spring. You often see them popping up, fresh and bedewed, in country churchyards or old cottage gardens. Other gorgeous autumn bulbs include Nerines — brilliant for flower arrangements — bright pink Amaryllis belladonna and such little gems as yellow Sternbergia or pink-flushed white Acis. There are true crocuses for October, too, and even a pre-Christmas snowdrop. Colchicum autumnale naturalises happily in grass and likes full sunshine. Buy them now as dry bulbs and expect fresh blooms within days. Some of these flower while the bulbs are semi-dormant. So you can buy them now as dry bulbs and expect fresh blooms within days. Plant them carefully, though, lest you snap off any tender buds. These lie just beneath the bulb's skin. LEAFY AFTERMATH . Colchicums have a serious downside. They may resemble crocuses but, unlike them, they produce enormous shucks of untidy leaves in late spring. Bear that in mind if you plant them at a border front. They may resemble crocuses but, unlike them, they produce enormous shucks of untidy leaves in late spring . The easiest to grow, Colchicum autumnale, is good for naturalising in grass, preferably in full sun. Like daffodils, it does best in ground that doesn't dry out too much. Biggerflowered crocus speciosus performs better in a well-lit border, and both species have white varieties as well as rosy purple. I rather like the big leaves, even when they tower above cowslips and daisies in our little spring meadow. But if they're not to your taste, choose true autumn crocuses instead. These, like their springblooming cousins, have sparse grassy leaves. Crocus speciosus — easiest and prettiest — comes later than most colchicums, and has purple flowers with orange stigmas and subtle striping. In groups, they look spectacular, but prefer soil to turf. Likewise, Acis autumnalis, the autumn snowflake. The tiny pinktinged white flowers look charming in big numbers. The grassy leaves which follow are discreet. None of these plants can equal the splendour of the nerine, undisputed queen of the autumn bulbs. The hardiest, Nerine bowdenii, produces long stems topped with startling pink flowers whose petals curl elegantly. They last well in water, and the bulbs, if happy, grow steadily. If the fluorescent pink of N. bowdenii is too strident for you, try the paler flowered Stefanie. FLIGHTS OF FANCY . I alsogrow Zeal Giant, a large loud hybrid with satiny pink flowers. It's survived horrible winters in my Lincolnshire garden. If you live in a mild area (Cornwall, say, or south-west Scotland) you could try the more fancy nerines. These are developed from the non-hardy Nerine sarniensis and come in hotter, more exciting colours. I've tried one called Codora which has vibrant red blooms but succumbed to slug attack and then got frozen through. If you live in a mild area (Cornwall or south-west Scotland) you could try the more fancy nerines . But if I had a roomy conservatory, I'd keep pots of fancy nerines outdoors from May to October and bring them inside for a late autumn bonanza. The colours of some are extraordinary — purple or even grey overlying crimson or pink. Unlike most bulbs, nerines flower best when planted shallow, in overcrowded conditions and baked in summer sun. If left undisturbed for years, these get so crammed together that some are squeezed out. Re-plant the expelled bulbs in a new spot. Nerine bowdenii loves a sunny border. The most prolific display I've ever seen was in a modest front garden near the sea, in Norfolk. The soil there was sandy — an extension of the beach, almost — but the nerines behaved as though they were at home in South Africa's muggy Eastern Cape.

"The U.S representative for Alaska alarmed students and teachers at a school assembly after making 'hurtful' and 'insensitive' comments about suicide days after a student killed himself. While speaking at Wasilla High School yesterday, Don Young - the longest serving Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives - said people often committed suicide because they had a lack of support from friends and family. The comments stunned his audience of about 120 English and government students as they were still mourning the loss of a student who died last Thursday. U.S representative for Alaska Don Young has been accused of making 'hurtful' comments about suicide during a talk with students at Wasilla High Schooldays after a boy had killed himself . Principal Amy Spargo told the Alaska Dispatch News: 'When I heard 'a lack of support from family' and I heard 'a lack of support from friends,' I felt the oxygen go out of the room, but I gasped as well. 'It just isn't true in these situations. It's just such a hurtful thing to say.' She said the remarks were 'hurtful' and 'insensitive'. The encounter occurred after teacher Carla Swick asked Mr Young about Alaska's high suicide and domestic violence rates and what his office was doing to address it. Ms Spargo and Ms Swick say a friend of the victim, shouted at Young that the deceased, 'Had friends. He had support.' And that he went on to say the cause of his death was depression, 'a mental illness'. Ms Spargo said Mr Young replied, 'Well, what, do you just go to the doctor and get diagnosed with suicide?' The congressman is said to have gone on to use the words '***hole or 'smartass'. About 120 students attended the talk and question and answer session which was ended by school principal Amy Spargo after Mr Young made comments against same-sex marriage . The politician's views on same-sex marriage also caused a stir when he compared to men getting married to bulls having sex. He was asked by junior student Zachary Grier why it was 'so bad in your eyes?' Ms Spargo said Mr Young, 81, answered by saying: 'You can't have marriage with two men. What do you get with two bulls?' Mr Young was then said to have said something about a lot of 'bullshazzle' or some word resembling the swear word. The principal said: 'At that point I was heading for the microphone. 'It was time to be done.' Ms Spargo said she talked briefly with Mr Young on his way out and he asked her who the boy was that shouted at him. She said, when told it was a friend of the boy who died, Mr Young replied: 'That boy needs to learn some respect.' Mr Young was also accused of using profanity and and telling stories not appropriate for a high-school audience. Mr Young's office later issued a statement about his talk at the school, saying he was 'serious and forthright' when discussing the issue of suicide. His spokesman, Matt Shuckerow said: 'He discussed what he believes are leading causes of youth suicide in our state and shared some suggestions for helping family members and friends who are dealing with suicidal thoughts. 'In no way did Congressman Young mean to upset anyone with his well-intentioned message. In light of the tragic events affecting the Wasilla High School community, he should have taken a much more sensitive approach.' The statement went on to say Mr Young had become frustrated by one student who had 'deprived their fellow classmates by talking throughout the presentation'. But the congressman, the statement said, had expressed 'his regret for any offence taken during the honest and spirited discussion' to the school. Ms Spargo was meeting with staff today to discuss the incident, and was unsure if she would take the matter further.","Congressman Don Young spoke at Alaska's Wasilla High School yesterday .

"Onion rings: Francisco Barrera attacked a customer with a switch blade and stun gun after the customer asked to have his cold onion rings reheated . What happened to 'Have it Your Way?' A New Mexico man is suing Burger King after he was attacked by a manager with a stun gun and a switch blade after receiving cold onion rings, officials say. The suit was filed by Robert Deyapp Oct. 1. Deyapp is seeking punitive damages for assault and negligent hiring and training following an incident that occurred June 2013 at a Bloomfield, New Mexico Burger King, according to Courthouse News Service. Deyapp reportedly tried to return his cold onions rings, asking for them to be reheated, when the restaurant's manager Francisco Barrera, 31, began making remarks about him in Spanish to a nearby employee. The Daily Times reports that Deyapp's complaint described Barrera saying this: 'This white boy is mad about his food and he doesn't even know that I'm going to return it and do whatever I want to it and he'll still eat it and never have any idea of what I did to his food.' Unfortunately for Barrera, Deyapp speaks fluent Spanish, according to the complaint. DT reports that Deyapp refused the onion rings and asked for a refund after hearing the remarks and  Barrera then began taking photos of Deyapp and his vehicle. Law suit: Robert Deyapp is seeking punitive damages for assault and negligent hiring and training following an incident that occurred June 2013 at a Bloomfield, New Mexico Burger King . The complaint states that Deyapp confronted Barrera about taking the photos and that's when Barrera attacked him with a stun gun and a switchblade. Deyapp reportedly avoided being injured until the police arrived. Barrera was arrested and later charged with aggravated assault in June, DT reports. In September, he was sentenced to one year probation and ordered to take an anger management course, court records state. DT reports that though Barrera was arrested and charged for the assault, Deyapp's story deviates wildly from that told at the time of Barrera's arrest more than a year ago. Decline: A Burger King spokesperson declined to comment on the situation saying that Burger King doesn't comment on pending litigation . At the time of the arrest, Deyapp reportedly told police that Barrera followed him out of the restaurant with the stun gun and switchblade after the two argued, according to the arrest warrant. A woman who saw the incident allegedly told police that after the two argued and Barrera began taking photos of Deyapp, Deyapp provoked Barrera and mockingly invited him to take photos of his truck as well. Also, Barrera claimed that he armed himself with the stun gun and switchblade after Deyapp threatened to get a gun from his truck, according to an affidavit. Now, more than a year after the incident, Deyapp is suing Burger King, Barrera, and several Burger King associates saying that the Burger King Corp., is guilty of negligent training, hiring and retention, according to DT. KRQE reports that the law suit states that Barrera has a history of being violent with customers and co-workers even prior to the June 2013 incident. The Associated Press reported that a Burger King spokesperson declined to comment on the situation saying that Burger King doesn't comment on pending litigation.","Robert Deyapp is suing Burger King after a manager attacked him with a stun gun and switchblade when he asked to have his cold onion rings reheated .

"Hot pursuit: Actor Nigel Havers, 61, said women 'never learn' and will always be drawn to cads . TV heart-throb Nigel Havers says women 'never learn' when it comes to men - because they cannot stop pursuing 'cads'. The star of The Charmer - who married his third wife, wealthy divorcee Georgiana Bronfman, in 2007 - discovers that his family history is not as upmarket as he had assumed in a new episode of Who Do You Think You Are? He finds out that his maternal great-great-grandfather, David Couch, had an illegitimate daughter with a 19-year-old servant girl. Havers, 61, told the Radio Times: 'You can’t help but think you’ve inherited some of their qualities. David was a bit of a cad, which is the sort of part I’ve played. 'I made The Charmer in 1987, which was dangerous for me because I didn’t think viewers would warm to such a ghastly character. And yet the opposite happened. However evil he was, people liked him. 'Throughout history women tend to like cads. They want to mother and change them. It’s exciting, but always ends in tears. 'They don’t learn, do they? I don’t mean that in a sexist way. Some women prefer a stable life, but others love danger.' The Chariots Of Fire actor added: 'Men are the same. I’ve always gone for women who are exciting, dangerous and fun - and I’ve met quite a few.' Havers left his first wife Carolyn Cox after 18 years, for actor Simon Williams’s sister Polly, resulting in a much-publicised divorce. They were married from 1989 until her death from cancer in 2004. Havers admitted: 'You could say leaving one woman for another is caddish.' The actor, whose father Lord Havers was attorney general and lord chancellor, assumed he came from an upmarket legal background but was delighted to discover an Essex girl - his great-great-grandmother Elizabeth, on his father’s side, who went on to marry a wealthy shoe manufacturer. Her father, who ran a Colchester hackney cab company, went bankrupt but his family were saved from the poor house by the Provident Asylum Society. Havers, who appeared on I’m A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here!, said: 'I am no longer posh, thank goodness...I might have ended up in the East End of London.' Unexpected attraction: Havers, pictured in the 1986 series The Charmer, said he was surprised that people were won over by his 'evil' character David . Upper crust: Havers, pictured here in a scene from Downton Abbey, said he is happy to be called 'posh' but loathes the term 'luvvie' The star also hit out at the BBC for using the word 'luvvie'. 'I was never p***ed off about being called posh but the one word I can’t stand is ""luvvie"". 'I was listening to (Radio 4 show) PM, and they said they had a luvvie on the programme,' he told the magazine. 'I phoned the BBC, was put through to the studio and demanded, ""Stop using that word. It’s such a put-down"". 'They invited me on the next day and Googled the number of times they’d used it - thousands. They promised they’d never do it again, and they haven’t,' he added.","61-year-old actor said women 'never learn' and have been drawn to rogues throughout history .

"Rechargeable bulbs that use nothing but sunlight could help bring lighting to areas with little or no access to electricity. Nokero's $15 (£9) Nokero N200 solar bulb recharges even in poor weather and lasts for six hours on a full charge. It has been designed for areas where there is limited or no electricity, but can also be used for camping trips or during power cuts. Scroll down for video . The $15 (£9) Nokero N200 bulb’s (pictured) solar cell recharges in low sunlight  and it is designed for areas where there is limited or no electricity. The bulb lasts for more than six hours following a day’s charge in low light, and this charging time drops to four-hours when used in bright sunlight . The N200 is a follow-up to the Denver-based firm’s N100 bulb, and the second-generation model won the 2013 USPTO Patents for Humanity Awards. Earlier this week, a Deutsche Bank study claimed solar prices are falling at a rate at which they will undercut prices for conventional energy sources such as coal and oil by 2016. The study is based on the assumption that the US government will keep its 30 per cent tax credit for solar in place. However, it added prices are likely to reach the lower level, even if this credit was dropped to 10 per cent. The report added that because solar is a technology, not a fuel, its price will continue to fall as the technology is made more efficient. The awards are aimed at rewarding innovations that use patented technologies to address humanitarian needs. Brightness-wise, the bulbs are not designed to replace electric versions, but instead are on par with kerosene lamps and similar devices used in poor areas. On its highest setting, the N200 reaches 13.5 lumens, compared to 850 lumens for a 60-watt bulb. It takes around a day to charge the N200 in low light, but this charging time drops to four hours in bright sunlight. The waterproof N200 is slightly larger than a traditional bulb, and it is fitted to a chrome-plated steel loop. This can be swivelled to face the sun using a single solar cell, and the power is distributed across four LEDs. Solar power is stored in a  1,000 mAh Ni-MH battery, which the firm claims will last for two years, and can be replaced for $1 (63p).

"Police arrested 17-year-old Will Campbell Monday for a mass shooting last month that injured 15 people inside a Miami restaurant hosting a teen club night. Campbell is being charged with attempted murder after he fired point blank into a 15-year-old school rival's stomach at The Spot then shot into the crowd as he fled. He will also be charged with one count of aggravated battery with a firearm for each of the 14 people he hit during his escape. The Spot: The Caribbean restaurant in north Miami doubled as a nightclub, and was hosting a teen night when 15 patrons were shot . According to the NBC Miami, Campbell is speaking with police in the company of his mother, said Police Chief Manuel Orosa. According to Orosa, bad blood from a fight at Norland Senior High School involving Campbell's friend and a 15-year-old spilled over into the club. The Miami Herald reports that Campbell approached the other teen and, pulling out a weapon, shot him 'point blank in the stomach.' The victim is in critical condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Campbell left the club still holding his weapon, firing multiple shots into the crowd and striking 14 other club goers from ages 11 to 25. The 17-year-old had a troubled past, having been kicked out of several schools in recent months. Aftermath: Shooting victims receive treatment from emergency services outside of The Spot after 17-year-old Will Campbell fired into the crowd . Aftermath: Shooting victims receive treatment from emergency services outside of The Spot after 17-year-old Will Campbell fired into the crowd . Crime scene: The area around The Spot is taped off as emergency responders treat victims. Campbell escaped Sunday morning after the shooting, allegedly with the help of a driver . At two schools Campbell had previously attended, he'd been in trouble for fighting, bringing a knife on school grounds and marijuana possession. In 2013, he was arrested on a charge of resisting with violence. Police said Campbell is currently booked as a juvenile, but that this status may change considering the circumstances of the crime. Detectives are still looking for a get-away driver. 'We need to show people you cannot go into an establishment and shoot indiscriminately and get away with it,' Orosa said. 'A lot of innocent people were hit by bullets.' Last week, the Spot's manager, Tiffany Johnson, 31, was arrested for distributing liquor without a license. The Spot is only licensed for beer and wine, and several liquor bottles were found behind the bar, though detectives are looking into whether any alcohol was served to minors. The Caribbean restaurant is not licensed to operate as a club, though management has hosted events in the past months, with some Saturdays being dedicated to an all-ages 'teen night.'","Will Campbell shot a 15-year-old student from Norland Senior High School in the stomach before fleeing, firing indiscriminately into the crowd .

"The death of a star Australian batsman stunned the cricket world yesterday and led to immediate concerns over the safety of helmets worn by players of all ages. Phillip Hughes died two days after being struck behind the ear by a ball while batting. Hughes, 25, who played against England in last summer’s Ashes and had represented three English county teams, did not regain consciousness after the sickening blow. Although he was wearing a helmet, a bouncer struck him on an unprotected part of his neck as he turned his back attempting a shot. The impact split his vertebral artery, causing a massive bleed. Surgeons in Sydney operated on Hughes to try to relieve the pressure on his brain but he died yesterday. Scroll down for video . As his devastated Australia team-mates mourned, the cricket world paid tribute to Hughes and rallied to support Sean Abbott, 22, the bowler who delivered the fatal ball, describing the tragedy as a freak accident. Manufacturers have been exploring ways to make cricket helmets safer – but they have faced resistance from the players and experts admit no helmets currently available would have been guaranteed to save Hughes, a left-hander who had represented Australia in 26 Tests. Under England and Wales Cricket Board regulations, all schoolchildren are required to wear helmets while batting and keeping wicket. New safety standards were introduced in Britain earlier this year, expanding the area of the grille in front of the face and jaw so a ball could not sneak through the gaps. Hughes, 25, who played against England in last summer’s Ashes and had represented three English county teams, did not regain consciousness after the sickening blow . The peak was stiffened and more protection provided around the cheekbones and at the back of the head. Even these improvements provide no protection for the vulnerable area at the back of the neck. Researchers from Loughborough and Cardiff University found last year that six per cent of cricket injuries result from balls striking the neck and a further 17 per cent from impacts on the back of the helmet. They recommended lowering the back of the shell to cover most of the neck. Rene Ferdinands, of the University of Sydney, said helmets could be changed, with a foam skull cap worn underneath to cover the back of the neck. Australian cricketer Sean Abbott wipes a tear from his eye as he arrives at the Sydney Cricket Ground . But changes to helmets have been opposed by players, who are said to believe such a design would reduce a batsman’s mobility as the ball hurtles towards him at around 90mph. Brendan Denning, chief executive of sports equipment firm Albion, said: ‘The ability of manufacturers to innovate is reliant on players embracing new technology and they are very, very traditional in cricket. 'Other sports, like horse racing, more readily accept that injury is an issue.’ Masuri – the firm that made the helmet Hughes was wearing – said the cricketer was not using its most recent model, which gives batsmen extra protection in the neck area. However, a spokesman for the firm added: ‘This is a vulnerable area of the head and neck that helmets cannot fully protect while enabling batsmen to have full and proper movement.’ Professor Antonio Belli of Birmingham University, a sports trauma expert, said the devastating injury Hughes suffered while playing for South Australia against New South Wales was simply bad luck. ‘We should design helmets as strong as technology allows,’ he said. ‘But we need to accept that in cricket and other sports that involve hard objects or bodily contact there will always be freak accidents.’ Former England star Geoff Boycott said helmets have given cricketers a false sense of security. He wrote in the Daily Telegraph: ‘Most of my career I batted without a helmet. You required judgment of what to leave, when to duck and when to play the ball. Helmets have taken away a lot of that fear.’ Ex-England captain Andrew Strauss said the natural response to tragedy was that massive change was needed, but added: ‘The protection in the game of cricket has never been better than it is today. I don’t think any cricketer will go out there to bat these days worrying that his life might be on the line.’ Parents Greg and Virginia Hughes and sister Megan leave Cricket NSW in Sydney .","Cricketer Phillip Hughes died surrounded by close family and friends at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney .

"Scientists have devised a plan to survive a nuclear winter that might follow a massive volcanic eruption. Experts say huge seismic disasters are inevitable – and we must use modern technology to limit the impacts of the very worst of them. They have drawn up plans to pump millions of tonnes of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere to stabilise the climate after a huge eruption. Scientists have devised a plan to survive a nuclear winter that might follow a massive volcanic eruption. Experts say huge seismic disasters are inevitable – and we must use modern technology to limit the impacts of the very worst of them. Pictured is the eruption ash cloud of Eyjafjallajokull Volcano, Iceland in 2010 . The study authors, from Reading University and Norway, aimed to produce a plan that might help people survive an event on the scale of the eruption of the Indonesian volcano of Tambora 200 years ago. That eruption - the biggest in the last 10,000 years - resulted in a 'year without summers'. Clouds of sulphuric gas blocked out the sun, cooling the temperature of the Earth for months on end. The Reading scientists, who worked with the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo (Cicero), calculated that the climatic impact of a repeat could be controlled. Producing huge quantities of a greenhouse gas called a hydrofluorocarbon, or HFC, would be sufficient to warm the atmosphere and balance the effect of the reduced temperature. The HFC would stop warmth leaving the planet, making up for the lack of solar heat reaching the atmosphere in the first place. The benefit of the plan is that HFCs are already produced industrially, to create plastics, although their manufacture would have to increase 100-fold to achieve the required effect . Afforestation: This technique would irrigate deserts, such as those in Australia and North Africa, to plant millions of trees that could absorb carbon dioxide. Drawback: This vegetation would also draw in sunlight that the deserts currently reflect back into space, and so contribute to global warming. Artificial ocean upwelling: Engineers would use long pipes to pump cold, nutrient-rich water upward to cool ocean-surface waters. Drawback: If this process ever stopped it could cause oceans to rebalance their heat levels and rapidly change the climate. Ocean alkalinisation: This involves heaping lime into the ocean to chemically increase the absorption of carbon dioxide. Drawback: Study suggests it will have of little use in reducing global temperatures. Ocean iron fertilisation: The method involves dumping iron into the oceans to improve the growth of photosynthetic organisms that can absorb carbon dioxide. Drawback: Studies suggest it will have of little use in reducing global temperatures. Solar radiation management: This would reduce the amount of sunlight Earth receives, by shooting reflective sulphate-based aerosols into the atmosphere. Drawback: Carbon dioxide would still build up in the atmosphere. The proposal, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, is the first significant geoengineering plan to avert disaster in the event of a volcanic eruption. HFCs are similar to CFCs –destructive compounds which were banned in fridges and aerosol sprays in the 1980s. However, the specific type of HFC that the scientists propose using does not harm the ozone layer, unlike its chemical cousins, and disappears from the atmosphere after a few years, breaking down naturally. The benefit of the plan is that HFCs are already produced industrially, to create plastics, although their manufacture would have to increase 100-fold to achieve the required effect. The researchers suggest a specific gas called HFC-152a would be used, as it breaks down naturally after a few years, reducing the long-term effect. Study author Professor Keith Shine, of the University of Reading, said: 'Unlike global warming, the climate impacts from a volcano eruption have a natural end-point beyond which we would not need to act further. 'However, the emissions of the short-lived gas we found to be needed are problematic in other respects. 'While a gas could in principle be found that has few associated detrimental environmental impacts, we estimate that large quantities would be needed. This would be very expensive, and would require a vastly expanded industrial production capacity. 'Society would have to decide whether the risks associated with such a large volcanic eruption could ever justify this expense.' HFCs are similar to CFCs –destructive compounds which were banned in fridges and aerosol sprays in the 1980s. However, the specific type of HFC that the scientists propose using does not harm the ozone layer, unlike its chemical cousins, and disappears from the atmosphere after a few years, breaking down naturally . Co-author Dr Jan Fuglestvedt added: 'Considering such drastic action may appear far-fetched. But it would be unwise for the scientific community and policymakers not to think the issue through. 'Future, large volcanic eruptions are inevitable.' 'However, to our knowledge, no one had considered whether similar ideas could be applied to temporary global cooling from volcanic eruptions. We investigated, and found that yes, in principle, they can.' The plan was welcomed by climate scientists yesterday. Professor John Shepherd of the University of Southampton said: 'The possibility of deliberate intervention to 'engineer' our climate is undoubtedly scary, but climate change causes problems for both people and ecosystems, especially if it is large and rapid, whether it is warming or cooling. 'It is sensible and responsible to consider whether, and if so how, we could moderate such changes, and to think through the benefits, costs and risks of doing so, before we attempt to reach any decisions about whether or not such actions should ever be considered. 'We need to be prepared, so far as possible, and explorations like this are desirable, even if some people find them distasteful.' Dr Matt Watson of the University of Bristol added: 'It is an interesting idea, with an appropriate level of careful caveats, and probably worthy of further investigation, not least because it broadens the debate on climate engineering to countering natural, as opposed to anthropogenic threat. And Professor Peter Cox of the University of Exeter said: 'This is an interesting left-field study suggesting that the cooling effects of a large volcano could be counteracted by deliberately injecting short-lived greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.'","Experts say huge seismic disasters are inevitable – and we must use modern technology to limit the impacts of the very worst of them .
Have drawn up plans to pump millions of tonnes of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere to stabilise the climate after a huge eruption .
Producing huge quantities of  hydrofluorocarbon, or HFC, would be sufficient to warm the atmosphere and balance the effect of the reduced temperature .
The HFC would stop warmth leaving the planet, making up for the lack of solar heat reaching the atmosphere in the first place."
"A Greenpeace campaigner claims he was forced to live on bread and water while being held in a Russian prison because it didn't offer a vegetarian alternative. Antony Perrett arrived home yesterday after spending two months in prisons in Murmansk and St Petersburg for trying to hang a climate change banner on an oil rig. The former town councillor is one a group of environmental activists known as the Arctic 30 who were being held in Russia on hooliganism charges. Since being released under a new amnesty . law, the 33-year-old has revealed he refused to eat some of the food . offered to him behind bars. Greenpeace activist Anthony Perrett has returned to his home in Newport, south Wales with his girlfriend Zahara Ally, after spending two months in Russian prison . 'All the prison food had low grade meat of unknown origin in it. I'm a vegetarian and I lost a lot of weight,' he said from his home in Newport, South Wales. Perrett said he passed his time in the rodent-infested jails by doing drawings with paper and pencils sent in a Greenpeace parcel, and communicating with other prisoners by whistling. 'We were not 100 per cent isolated but we were in cells 23 hours a day. We would have one hour to exercise in a four metre square cell with no roof. 'We would shout over the wall and speak to different people every day, some days they would be Russian and some days they would be crew mates.' 'We chatted and stuff and whistled the Great Escape, that was kind of a farewell.' Perrett and his fellow activists were arrested on board the Greenpeace ship, Sunrise, by Russian authorities in September. The campaigner spent much of his time behind bars drawing pictures with pencils and paper delivered in a Greenpeace parcel . The former town councillor said he was more able to communicate with foreign cellmates by drawing pictures . He was originally charged with piracy but had the offence dropped in favour of hooliganism for his hand in the protests. If convicted, he could have spent seven years in the squalid prison where disease was rife. 'The entire first floor of the block was contaminated with TB,' he said. 'You would see all the guys on the first floor wearing face masks, there was a real risk of tuberculosis everywhere.' The freezing temperatures however meant insects were few and far between. 'One virtue of being in Murmansk is that it's freezing so pests are not a huge problem. 'There were a lot of rats and stray cats in there. One night there was a midnight raid and I found myself face to face with a guard dog,' recalls Perrett who said he would protest in the country again but only after a shift in government. After a month in Murmansk, the campaigner was moved to Kestry prison in St Petersburg. Perrett said the Kestry prison in St Petersburg was riddled with stray cats and rats and that parts of the jail were contaminated with tuberculosis . Perrett said he communicated with other Greenpeace activists by whistling over prison walls. In spite of his ordeal, the 33-year-old said he would 'do it all again' It's good to be back: Perrett said it was 'fantastic' to be back in Wales after finding out he would be released on Christmas Eve . The reunited couple are pictured arriving back in Britain after flying from St Petersburg, Russia . 'One of my cell mates was a convicted robber and had assaulted a police officer with a deadly weapon and the other chap was a suspected gangster. 'I got on very well with them, they were nice to me,' said Perrett who, in spite of everything, would 'do it all again.' 'I have been locked in cells with seven Russian gangsters, many with ears and fingers missing, scars of violence all over them. I was just accepted as one of them.' Kieron Bryan spent his time behind bars planning how to propose to his girlfriend . He was even able to overcome language barriers by showing drawings to his foreign cellmates. 'I made a lot of drawings, I could explain stories through drawings and create crude comic books for what I was trying to explain. 'I made hundreds, absolutely hundreds of drawings. I gave them to various different people. I've a few left.' Perrett was bailed on November 20 and was joined by his girlfriend, Zahara Ally, in Russia. He arrived in London last week along with four other activists, including Keiron Bryan, who spent his time in prison planning how to propose to his girlfriend. The 29-year-old popped the question to Nancy Thorburn, 27, when the pair were reunited in St Petersburg. 'I decided while I was in prison that I wanted her to be my wife,' said Bryan who spent 60 days in jail. The journalist told the Sunday Times: 'We were only going to have 36 hours together so I didn't think I would ask her but as soon as I saw her I just knew I had to.' Greenpeace is now keen to retrieve its boat whose return has been ordered by the international court of the sea. 'Give us back the Sunrise! That would be . great,' added Perrett who has returned home from freezing conditions to a . broken boiler. Back on British soil: Anthony Perrett, Kieron Bryan, Alexandra Harris, Iain Rogers and Phil Ball arrived in London last week after being arrested in Russia in September . Greenpeace is now eager to retrieve its ship, the Sunrise, after the international court of the sea ordered its return . He arrived in London on Friday 29 December with activists Alexandra Harris and Phil Ball, Sunrise crew member Iain Rogers and freelance videographer Kieron Bryan. The campaigners were told they were going to be released on Christmas Eve. 'It's fantastic being back,'  Anthony said. 'I stopped at the Severn Bridge and paid my toll and they were like, ""Oh, hello, how's it going?""' 'Everyone has been up for a bit of banter. It's great to be able to communicate with people after spending so long speaking broken English and broken Russian. 'It's nice to get home and not have to explain my jokes.'","Anthony Perrett was released from Russian prison last week .

"The cuckolded husband of a woman involved in a 'close relationship' with the Bishop of Arundel has called for him to be sacked from the Catholic Church. Simon Hodgkinson, whose wife, Olivia, 43, is the latest woman to be linked to the bishop, is compiling a formal complaint against Kieran Conry over his intimate friendship with her. It has been claimed that Bishop Conry had relationships with up to four women, breaking his vow of celibacy. Scroll down for video . Kieran Conry, the Bishop of Arundel and Brighton, had a secret relationship with Olivia Hodgkinson . The bishop resigned two weeks ago after admitting he had been ‘unfaithful to my promises as a Catholic priest' Mr Hodgkinson's complaint will be sent to Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, the Papal Nuncio, the Pope's representative in the UK, and the Vicar General, one of the Church's most powerful figures, the Sunday Telegraph reported. As well as stating Bishop Conry broke his celibacy vow, the complaint will say he has gone against Church teachings on adultery, marriage and family life by having a close relationship with Mrs Hodgkinson, a 43-year-old mother-of-two, and an affair with another married woman. Mr Hodgkinson also claims the bishop abused his authority, taking advantage of both women after they turned to him for help with their marriages. Graham Baldwin, from the charity Catalyst - which helps individuals whose family life has been affected by religious or cult groups - said: 'Bishop Conry has ... by his own admission on at least one occasion, committed adultery with a married woman, which in the eyes of the Church is a mortal sin. 'He needs to be laicised - what most people would understand as defrocked - and removed from the priesthood.' Mr Hodgkinson, a 44-year-old banker, said: 'His behaviour has been appalling. To think that this is a person who people turn to for marriage advice is unbelievable. It makes him a hypocrite.' Bishop Conry, 63, resigned as Bishop of Arundel and Brighton a fortnight ago, saying he had been 'unfaithful to my promises as a Catholic priest'. He said it 'was the easiest way to avoid further embarrassment, disappointment...and shame for the church.' Simon Hodgkinson is compiling a formal complaint against Kieran Conry over his intimate friendship with Olivia . Bishop Conry says he still wants to be a priest, despite being forced to resign a fortnight ago . In his resignation statement added that his actions 'were not illegal and did not involve minors.' Despite this, the bishop insisted he wanted to remain in the Church as a priest. Mr Hodgkinson discovered his wife's affair after she did not attend choir practice at their local church. He went to drop off some music through her letterbox to find she was not home at around 10pm. He said: 'I thought it was really weird. I decided it was time to test my suspicion that she was having an affair. ‘I went up to the bishop’s residence and her car was there. I checked and it was there all night. I was devastated.’ Since then a second love affair with a married mother-of-three six years ago has come to light, and he has been linked to two other women. Questions have been raised over whether the Catholic Church turned a blind eye to the bishop's behaviour. After writing a letter to the bishop asking whether the pair were having an affair, Mr Hodgkinson did not receive a reply. He then sent a second letter to the bishop, as well as the Papal Nuncio, the Vicar General and Cardinal Vincent Nichols, but none of them have responded. Mr Hodgkinson said: ‘The thought of losing my wife to someone who has behaved so irresponsibly is awful. ‘He has abused his authority to the extent that he has allowed a married woman and mother of two children to sleep in his house and he has been completely blind to the emotional impact on the people affected by this. ‘For someone in his position to create that much emotional distress without really noticing or thinking about the consequences and then failing to explain himself is arrogant. Conry technically remains both a priest and a bishop, even though he is no longer responsible for Arundel and Brighton.","Simon Hodgkinson's wife had a 'close relationship' with a Catholic bishop .

"Ashutosh Maharaj, seen here on a billboard in Punjab, has been in deep freeze for six weeks . An Indian guru declared dead six . weeks ago has been put into a deep freezer by his followers - who are . convinced he will come back to life. Ashutosh . Maharaj, the leader of the Divya Jyoti Jagrati Sansthan (Divine Light . Awakening Mission), is in a state of samadhi - the deepest form of . meditation, according to his believers, and is sending them messages. Mission spokesman Swami Vishalanand said followers were . now waiting for him to end his meditation and expect him to step out of the freezer in the town of Nurmahal, in the state of Punjab, northern India. Until then they would perform their own . meditation and spiritual sessions. 'Mahara-ji (a Hindi term of respect) is . still sending messages through followers in their meditative stage to . protect his body until he returns,' Mr Vishalanand said. The decision to place Maharaj in a freezer was challenged in court by a man claiming to be his former driver, who alleged several followers were not releasing the body because they wanted a share of the guru's properties. But the court rejected the man's claim after receiving information from authorities confirming his death, reportedly from a heart attack. 'The court rejected his pleas after the Punjab government said that the man is clinically dead and that it is up to his followers to decide what they want to do with the body,' Reeta Kohli, additional advocate general of Punjab state, said. Senior district police officer Gurinder Singh Dhillon said police 'cannot interfere' now that the court has made its ruling.

"Prince William could become an air ambulance helicopter pilot instead of starting full-time royal duties this year. He gave up his job as an RAF search and rescue pilot eight months ago to start a ‘transitional’ year of public service placements as part of his preparation for becoming King. But sources claim William, 31, has decided he is not ready to move on to full-time royal duties when this period comes to an end in September, and is keen to return to flying. Misses flying: The Duke of Cambridge, Prince William at the controls of his Sea King helicopter, after he qualified as an operational search and rescue captain . William hinted at a return to the skies during his family's recent official trip to New Zealand . One option would be to enlist as a pilot for the East Anglian Air Ambulance, which is based near his country home in Norfolk. William hinted at a return to the skies during his family’s recent official trip to New Zealand. Touring an aviation museum, he said seeing the historic military aircraft made him ‘long to be flying again’ and revealed that he hoped to obtain a commercial pilot’s licence. He already holds a private pilot’s licence from his time in the RAF. Acquiring a commercial licence would allow him to fly civilian helicopters such as air ambulances. In a possible sign of where his intentions lie, William and the Duchess of Cambridge will meet representatives of the Scottish Air Ambulance Service on a visit to Crieff, near Perth, on Thursday. A source said: ‘William has privately said he does not want to give up flying and hopes to find a way to incorporate it into what he does in the future. ‘He will not become a full-time working member of the royal family in September, and Charles and the Queen support him in this.’ However, Kate may have some concerns about her husband becoming a pilot again. Writing in the introduction to a new book, Living In the Slipstream: Life As An RAF Wife, she revealed: ‘I cannot pretend that I didn’t feel anxious at times when William was on shift in howling gales, knowing that he was out flying in extremely challenging conditions.’ On Thursday he will visit an air ambulance team during a trip to Crieff, near Perth, with his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge . The Duke of Cambridge shows the Prince of Wales one of the Sea King helicopters, as Prince Charles visits RAF Valley on Anglesey in July 2012 . The East Anglian Air Ambulance was launched in 2000 after an appeal led by jockey Frankie Dettori, who was involved in a plane crash in which the pilot was killed. Today there are two helicopters, funded by donations, which fly every day of the year, covering Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. A Kensington Palace spokesman said: ‘The Duke of Cambridge is currently considering his options and an announcement will be made in due course.’ The East Anglian Air Ambulance was unavailable for comment.","William stepped down as a rescue pilot with the RAF a year ago .

"'All-nighter': Moritz Erhardt, 21, had been working gruelling hours as an intern at an investment bank . A young student who died after working 'crazy hours' as an intern at a top investment bank said he felt 'pressurised' to succeed before his death. German student Moritz Erhardt collapsed in the shower at his student halls in east London just days before completing a grueling internship at Bank of America Merrill Lynch International investment bank division. Friends of the 21-year-old, who had recently completed a study abroad programme at the University of Michigan, claimed he had been forced to work through the night eight times in a two week period in an effort to secure long term work with the firm. But it has emerged that he always felt compelled to be the best, a competitive edge which, he admitted sometimes caused him 'severe injuries.' In an online portfolio Mr Erhadt told prospective employers that his upbringing taught him to always be driven to be good at everything. He wrote: 'I have grown up in family that expected me, in whatever respect, to excel in life. 'By implication, I felt somehow pressurizes [sic]. However I did not intend to blie my parents' expectations. 'Therefore I have become highly competitive and ambitious nature from early on. 'Already during my times in elementary school I began playing soccer as well as tennis, I engaged in track and field athletics, and I started ski racing. 'Sometimes I had a tendency to be over ambitious, which resulted in severe injuries. 'With respect to my performance in school, I was striving for excellence and trying to be the best all the time.' Reflecting on his intensive approach to his education he added: 'Over the last year, I have learned that complacency implies stagnancy.' Grueling internship: Friends of the 21-year-old claimed Mr Erhardt, pictured, had been forced to work through the night eight times in a two week period . The profile also shows that prior to . his seven week internship at Merrill Lynch, he had also completed . placements at KPMG Consulting, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank's . corporate finance division. Mr Erhadt had studied business administration as an exchange student at the University of Michigan before attending WHU Otto Beisheim School of Managment in Vallendar, Germany, according to the Evening Standard. Last night a representative for the Otto Beissheim School of Management business college where Mr Ergardt studied and from where he was due to graduate next year, called him 'a wonderful person.' Head of PR Peter Augstin said: 'We are all deeply shocked. He was a wonderful person and a dedicated student.  He will be sadly missed. We are still trying to come to terms with his death.' Body: The body of Moritz Erhardt, pictured with a friend, was discovered on Thursday evening . He was a regional leader of the Junge . Union, the youth organisation for the political pary of Christian . Democratic Union and also a regional champion tennis player who won . school awards in maths, English and French. The student had also visited Israel to try to 'understand' the Arab-Israel conflict and donated English book to Palestinian teenagers at an international school in Bethlehem. He as planning to apply to the MBA program at the Ross School of Business in Michigan and was also considering a graduate degree in public policy, foreign affairs or philosophy. Mr Erhadt was discovered by friends at Claredale House in Bethnal Green on Thursday, paramedics tried to resuscitate him but he was pronounced dead at the scene, it is believed that he suffered from epilepsy and could have had a seizure. Speaking outside the student halls which are let to hundreds of interns each summer, one friend said he believed the long hours played a part in Mr Erhadt's tragic death. He said: 'He was working in investment banking and apparently he pulled eight all-nighters in two weeks. 'They get you working crazy hours and maybe it was just too much for him in the end.' Paid interns at the bank normally earn £45,000 ($70,550) a year pro rata - around £2,700 ($4,200) a month. Yesterday, internet forum users also said he had been working 'all-nighters' during his stay with the company. Many . banks are known to encourage their young students to work late into the . night and in the past there have been claims those keen to impress have . put in long hours with very little sleep. Superstar: Friends called Mr Erhardt, pictured center, the 'superstar' of the internship programme . On one site, called . wallstreetoasis.com, many posters insisted Mr Erhardt regularly worked . long hours and added: 'One of the best interns at BAML – three . all-nighters, didn't turn up, colleagues went to find him.' A fellow intern called Mr Erhardt 'the superstar' of the programme. He said: 'We typically work 15 hours a day or more and you would not find a harder worker than him. 'He seemed a lovely guy and was very popular with everyone. He was tipped for greatness.' Mr . Erhardt had been living in the Claredale House student accommodation . flats in Bethnal Green, East London. The apartments are rented out to . hundreds of interns during the summer months. A . friend from one of Mr Erhardt's classes said that he was such a . workaholic that he would turn in assignments early because he 'wanted to . be the best.' Work experience: Student Moritz Erhardt, pictured in front of St Paul's Cathedral, was working as an intern in London . Dedicated: Moritz Erhardt, pictured taking time out of work (left), was an ambitious 21-year-old . The female friend, who was in his strategy class at the Ross School of Management, also revealed that he was a 'night owl' who was used to staying up late studying. She said: 'He was always asking questions of the teachers to stay ahead of his work. He was always presenting his work early, handing in his projects ahead of time.' The friend added: 'He was just a hard worker. He wanted to be the best. 'I don't know what happened in that situation... maybe the situation got the better of him. 'He . would work very late in college, I don't know if that lifestyle was . hard for his body. He would stay up late at night and he was a night . owl. He liked to sleep in.' Another poster on the . wallstreetoasis.com site added: 'It is absolutely true – he was found . dead in the shower by his flatmate. Intern at BAML who went home at 6am . three days in a row.' On . Friday, staff at the Claredale complex issued a statement to residents, . part of which read: 'Some of you might be aware that the emergency . services were called to Claredale yesterday evening. 'The . reason for this is that we were made aware of an incident involving one . of our residents. Sadly the resident concerned had passed away. 'To . avoid any rumours or misinformation, we would like to inform you all . that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.' In recent years interns have told of working long hours at investment banks. Long hours: Mr Erhardt was near the end of his seven-week summer internship with Bank of America Merrill Lynch International in London when he died . One 20-year-old told London's Evening Standard in 2011 that 'you work whatever hours you're  asked to.' He added: 'Every intern's worst . nightmare is what's called ""the Magic Roundabout"" – which is when you . get a taxi to drive you home at 7am and then it waits for you while you . shower and change and then takes you back to the office.' Another . 24-year-old told the same newspaper: 'About 100 hours a week was the . minimum and the average was probably 110. I worked six-and-a-half days a . week.' Summer stay: Mr Erhardt, from Germany, had been staying at Claredale House in Bethnal Green, London, during his internship . A source at Merrill Lynch said Mr Erhardt had completed previous internships . at other investment banks but could not confirm or deny claims he had . worked exceptionally long hours. However he insisted staff are given both 'mentors' and 'buddies' when they join the firm and are monitored by staff from the human resources department. The source added Mr Erhardt was very well-liked by members of staff and there will now be a post mortem examination and inquest into his death. A statement from BAML said: 'We are deeply shocked and saddened by the news of Moritz Erhardt's death. 'He was popular amongst his peers and was a highly diligent intern at our company with a promising future. 'Our first thoughts are with his family and we send our condolences to them at this difficult time.'","Moritz Erhardt had been interning with investment bank Merrill Lynch .

"Michael Schumacher has shown slight signs of improvement, 94 days after being placed in an artificial coma, his manager has said. Sabine Khem said the 45-year-old Formula 1 ace, who has been sedated since his skiing accident at the French resort of Meribel in December last year, will not be confined to a vegetative state for the rest of his life. His family is said to be planing to build a custom multi-million pound mini-clinic to care for him, but not in the home he shares with Corinna, as previously reported, but in the house of his father Rolf. New hope: Schumacher's manager last week said the F1 driver has shown 'encouraging signs' of improvement . ‘I can only repeat there are signs that give us encouragement,’ said Sabine Kehm, claiming unending ‘negative’ reports that doctors fear he will be condemned to life as a vegetable are untrue. ‘Family, friends and doctors are optimistic,’ said Bild, without elaborating on where the optimism comes from. Earlier this week it was said that his . wife Corinna is planning on spending £10million on building a fully . equipped medical suite on their vast family estate in Switzerland, . although new reports say it will be built at his father's home. Even though Corinna Schumacher, 45, has been told by doctors it is highly unlikely the racing ace will ever wake up from his medically induced coma, she has decided to use the family's £500million fortune to build the facility in their lavish £25million estate on the banks of Lake Geneva, Switzerland. Today is the three month anniversary of the Alps skiing accident where the seven-time F1 champion, 45, hit his head and was put into an induced coma to reduce brain swelling. Bring him home: Reports had claimed that Corinna planned to build a multi-million pound facility so her husband can leave hospital, but these were subsequently denied by family and friends of the former F1 ace . Successful: The £25million estate on the shores of Lake Geneva where the Schumacher family live . Since then, there have been few encouraging signs of recovery and the racing ace has been wasting away in his hospital bed, losing 25 per cent of his body mass to now only weigh 8st 7lbs. A friend of the Schumacher's, who has known the family for 25 years said: 'Miracles happen, of course, and as a wealthy man he has the best care money can buy. 'But all the money in the world cannot fix what has happened to him. The family are making arrangements for a future of permanent immobility. 'Is there a sense of denial at play among them? I would say yes,' the friend told The Sun. The family's life has been taken over by the accident, every day they make the 150-mile round trip from their home in Switzerland to the Grenoble University Hospital, France, where Schumacher is receiving the best possible care. They spend up to ten hours by his bedside, offering up prayers for his recovery, before returning home in the evening. Mrs Schumacher has always been a devoted wife, extremely supportive of her husband's career. Mr Schumacher once said: 'It is not so easy to find a partner who unconditionally adapts to the pace of my life.' Both . growing up in the same region of West Germany, Michael and Corinna . Schumacher met at a party in 1991 and fell in love. The pact that has . seen their loving relationship endure is that she allows him pursue his . high-octane career and, in return, he would give her everything she . could want. Keen skier: Thrill-seeker Schumacher had been a keen and skilled skier before his accident in December . Waiting: The Grenoble University Hospital, where Schumacher has been in an induced coma for three months . Loving support: Corinna arrives at the hospital to which she and family make a daily 150-mile round trip . With an . accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, . Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that . will be needed in the coming years.  This will include physiotherapists, . to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and . neurological experts. He . used the staggering fortunes from his 22-year career to snap up a ranch . in Texas, where Corinna raises horses, as well as apartments and ski . chalets around the world - including the one in Meribel from which he . set out on the tragic day late last year. He even built the estate on Lake Geneva where the new medical facility will be installed. As a result, Mrs Schumacher refuses to give up on the man she once described as the 'perfect partner'. The family friend told The Sun she 'would view breaking faith with the hope of a miracle a betrayal, little better than treachery. 'She feels that the family communes around his bedside pulsate their hope and love to him, and that of the millions of fans worldwide who share that faith. 'She can’t express defeat because that would be the end of her.'","Schumacher is showing slight 'encouraging' improvements, manager says .

"Thousands of passengers have been left stranded across Europe as snow storms and freezing temperatures have forced airports to shut down. As Britain braces itself for its own travel chaos, hazardous weather has already left transport at a standstill in other European countries. More than 1,000 unfortunate travellers resembled refugees at Munich airport as they were left no choice but to sleep overnight on camp beds provided by the airport. Scroll down for video . Stranded: Passengers at Munich Airport had to sleep overnight on camp beds supplied by the authorities in Terminal 2 after heavy snowstorms caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled . Chaos: Authorities have suggested that that the hazardous conditions could leave 20,000 passengers stranded across Germany . Heavy snowfalls and ice led to hundreds of flight cancellations at Germany's second-busiest airport. Across the country, an estimated 20,000 could be left with nowhere to go as planed stayed grounded. With no hotel capacity available near Munich airport, where 300 flights were cancelled, to deal with the stranded passengers, staff struggled as they handed out blankets and soft drinks. Uncomfortable: Munich airport, Germany's second-busiest, originally had 971 flights on its timetable for Thursday when the weather deteriorated and cancellations began . Miserable passengers were lined up in hundreds of beds for an uncomfortable night's sleep in the waiting areas of Terminal 2. The take-off runways at Munich had to be . cleared of snow eight times on Thursday and overnight to Friday, with . nearly 500 personnel in action. The south German airport had . previously cut around 10 percent of scheduled services on Thursday and . expected the proportion to rise to 20 percent by the evening weather . conditions deteriorated. The airport originally had 971 flights on its timetable for Thursday. Edgar Engert, a Munich airport spokesman, speaking yesterday, said: 'We’ve cleared both of our runways three . times already today.' 'We try to keep one in operation at all times, and we are . doing a lot of de-icing of planes.' Hundreds of miles away in Hamburg, there was a human cause to the plethora of delays, as security personnel staged a walkout that gridlocked the passenger terminals. Out of 20 security checkpoints at the . airport, only one was in operation. Passengers were warned of 'extremely . lengthy delays' over the walkout called by the Verdi union. Almost 95 percent of its employees manning the scanners did not report for work, having an obvious effect on passengers. Desperate measures: An airplane is sprayed with de-icing fluid prior to its take-off at the Munich Airport, where 500 staff have struggled to make aircraft and runways suitable for flying . Plummeting: Staff struggle to de-ice a plane on the runway as temperatures plummeted . 'Passengers can land in Hamburg but they cannot leave the plane,' said . airport executive board chief Michael Eggenschwiler, explaining that the . chaos in departures was choking up the rest of the airport. The combination of the industrial action and the weather will cost the affected counties millions in  lost revenue. Havoc: There have also been significant delays at Stuttgart airport and in Hamburg, where security staff staged a walkout . An . airport spokeswoman: 'Just about nothing is moving - many passengers have missed their . planes and tempers are frayed.' She added that there are long lines leading leading to the . terminals and many passengers have missed their planes, leaving them angered by the situation. There were delays also at Stuttgart . airport and across the border in Austria, where Vienna airport was closed to . new landings on Friday due to five inches of snow. Vienna airport was closed for inbound flights from as early as 1:20pm on Thursday, with its website listing more than 160 scrapped flights. Fraport AG’s Frankfurt Airport, Europe’s third-busiest in terms of passenger numbers, reported 40 cancellations of flights yesterday of 1,193 takeoffs and landings scheduled. Basel airport in Switzerland also shut . down its landing strips on Friday morning as fleets of snowblowers . struggled to clean the runways. The lack of a security walkout in Munich was bad news for one female passenger arriving from South America. Customs officials, suspicious at her . nervous behaviour on Thursday, stopped and searched the woman to . discover 1lb of pure cocaine tucked in a plastic bag hidden beneath her . wig. 'It is not every day that we come across . cocaine hidden in a braided wig,' said Thomas Meister of the customs . office in Munich. Get ready: Around 70 flights were cancelled at Heathrow airport - snow hit the capital this morning . Paris was among French other European cities bracing itself for a white-out this weekend, as huge parts of the country were covered in snow and ice. The temperature in the Ile de France department, in which the capital is located, was expected to fall below -10c. ‘It will be extremely cold and there is likely to be a fair amount of snow,’ said a spokesman for France Meteo, suggesting that British visitors should come prepared. Expatriates in areas such as Brittany, Normandy and the Dordogne were also warned to expect snow, where bad weather warnings were issued. In all, 38 departments in the west and centre of the country were placed on ‘orange alert’ – the highest possible. Despite this, rail and other travel services were generally running smoothly. Alpine ski resorts also reported a huge increase in business thanks to the cold weather.

"It is the crime we have accused the Germans of for decades – hogging the sun loungers. But now, it seems, holidaying Britons might have to throw in the towel in the battle for the moral high ground by the swimming pool. For it is us, and not them, who are more likely to get up early, creep down from our hotel rooms and bag the coveted spots, at least according to an investigation by the mass-selling German newspaper Bild. Scroll down for video . All quiet on the pool side: The loungers in the  resort at Lloret de Mar, Costa Brava, are free of towels at 7.36am . Flagged up: Circled here are the British families’ towels ‘reserving’ loungers at 9.21am, according to Bild . It monitored activity in the hotly contested pool side area at a hotel in the Spanish resort of Lloret de Mar on the Costa Brava, a region long popular with sunseekers from both countries. Bild apparently took two photos: the first at 7.36am showing all the sun loungers empty and towel free, the second at 9.21am showing most of the sun loungers bedecked with a towel – including one emblazoned with a Union Jack and one with a St George’s Cross – but still not a human on them. When the lounger baggers eventually turned up to claim their spots, the paper’s reporter went to find out who they are – and it then printed the findings under the headline: ‘Photo evidence in the war of the towels. The English are the worst lounger squatters!’ The paper focuses on three families it identifies as British and says the hotel is filled with English holidaymakers. However, it doesn’t detail the owners of the other pictured towels. Potentially they could all belong to Britons. One family was identified in Bild as Julie, 49, Danni, 19, and Korban, 12. They said they claimed their sun loungers earlier, including laying a towel decorated with images of England soccer stars on one, because a party of French vacationers ‘stole’ them all the day before. One-nil to England: Bild identified Korban and his mother Julie as among those who bagged their spots early . ‘Not enough places’: Darren, 43, from Exmouth, Devon, at the holiday resort with daughters Elouise and Daisy . Car mechanic Darren, 43, from Exmouth, Devon, holidaying with daughters Elouise, nine, and Daisy, seven, and proud owner of a Union Jack towel, said: ‘I was in a queue at 8.50am. Without a reservation you don’t stand a chance. There are simply not enough places for everyone.’ Asked if Germans or Britons were the worst poolside hogs he said: ‘I don’t know. We often have exchange students staying from Germany. I find them very polite and friendly.’ The third family identified, Carolina, 52, from Farnborough, Hampshire, and her husband Mark, said they bagged their places because ‘everybody does it.’ Another tourist, Linda, 55, from Somerset, put towels on seven loungers for her family. ‘If we all want to be together we have no other choice,’ she told Bild. It is the latest skirmish in the long-running battle of the sun loungers and follows another recent article in Bild which mocked Britons on foreign holidays for being drunken, stupid, overweight, lecherous, tattooed and sunburnt. ‘Everyone does it’: Carolina, 52, husband Mark and son Josh, from Farnborough, Hampshire, said they are doing no different to anyone else . It poked fun at British men abroad with ‘red and white chests’ and the women with ‘underwear amnesia’ – and suggested we have ‘Prince Harry Syndrome’, which it described as a compulsive need to undress. It also referred to the condition ‘balcony leg’ which it blamed on Britons injuring themselves trying to jump into the hotel pool. A survey of German holidaymakers in June claimed British tourists are second only to Russians when it comes to nationalities they dislike most on holiday. The research by German travel operator Urlaubstours found Germans viewed Britons as both loud and all too often drunk.","German newspaper Bild carried out investigation into sun lounger hoggers .

"Dead at 47: Antje Crapnik was found dead in bed by her lover after a drink and drugs binge . Dressed in a skin-tight dress and showing off her ample cleavage, Antje Crapnik looks relaxed and happy as she poses for a photograph. There is nothing to hint that her life would end abruptly at the age of 47 - or that her last days would be dogged by such sordid ignominy. For this is the first picture of the woman dubbed the 'German nymphomaniac', a person so sexually obsessed she was accused of imprisoning two men in her Munich apartment so they could make love to her. The woman's first victim complained that she forced him to sexually perform . eight times before he finally escaped via her balcony wearing his underwear. Another victim, an African man, aged 36, was found . weeping in the street outside her home after an ordeal lasting 36 hours. Recalling his . encounter with Miss Crapnik, the man said: 'I met her on a bus. She . invited me back here. Oh God, it was hell. I can't walk. Please help . me.' Miss Crapnik was . found lying dead next to her latest and last lover in her bed on Friday. The man, who was her neighbour, rang police to report her death when he woke up to . find her lifeless beside him. He said: 'I knew something was wrong because usually she wanted it first thing in the morning.' An . autopsy will determine what the cause of death was - and whether her insatiable . sex drive had anything to do with it. Her last lover said to police that she had 'been . hitting the wine' before they retired to her room on Thursday night and that she had snorted a drug. Miss Crapnik, dubbed the woman who could not say 'nein', formerly owned a fashion store before her sex drive forced . her into poverty and on to welfare. She told social workers she needed . sex up to ten times a day, every day. Miss Crapnik's mother told Germany's Bild newspaper: 'She . was a sick person.' She spoke with her mother the night before she died.  Her . daughter complained that 2012 was a terrible year and that next year 'would be better'. Imprisoned: Antje Crapnik, 47, was found dead by her latest lover at her home in Munich. She was arrested earlier this year for imprisoning men for lengthy sex ordeals . Recurrent and intense sexual fantasies, sexual urges, and sexual behavior, lasting at least six monthsExcessive amounts of sex, frequently used to cope with stressSex interfering with the ability to function in daily life, e.g. job or social lifeFeeling out of control and having to act on sexual urges, even in situations it might cause significant problems or harm, such as job loss, relationship problems or financial difficultiesThe sexual fantasies, urges and behaviors must not be brought on by drugs or alcohol, or another mental disorder . SOURCE: UCLA . Her first victim Dieter Schulz, 43, met her in a bar in . the centre of his home city. She took him back to her apartment and they had . sex several times. But when the woman demanded more, the exhausted man said . no. A police spokesman said: 'He complied with the woman's wishes another few . times so he could finally leave the apartment. 'But when she continued to refuse and demanded even more . sex from him, he fled to the balcony.'  Schulz phoned police and pleaded . for assistance. 'You have got to help me,' he told them. 'She is trying . to kill me with sex. I cannot get out - and I cannot go on!' When police arrived to question the woman and free Schulz . she invited two officers to join her in bed for a 'quickie', but they declined. She was taken for evaluation at a psychiatric hospital following the arrest.","Antje Crapnik found dead in Munich home after drink and drug binge .

"Ben Thomas, 5, suffered from Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) which caused his skin to blister and peel away . A little boy is lucky to be alive after suffering a painful rash that caused 99 per cent of the skin on his body to scald and peel away. Five year-old Ben Thomas, from Waltham Abbey, Essex, spent three weeks in intensive care after eventually being diagnosed with Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) – a condition where bacteria causes the outer layer of skin to shed. But doctors misdiagnosed his condition twice, at first prescribing antibiotics as they thought it was tonsillitis. Then, as the rash got worse, they misdiagnosed him with another rare condition. Believing he had Steven-Johnsons Syndrome - a severe allergic reaction to antibiotics - they took him off the drugs in the hope the rash would go down. But after 18 hours off medication, the rash was getting worse. A new doctor instantly recognised the condition as SSSS and screamed that Ben should be put back on antibiotics instantly. But it was too late by then, and Ben's mother, Annette Devonshire, 38, had to watch helplessly while her little boy spent three weeks in intensive care at the burns unit at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford and lost 99 per cent of his skin. Now recovering at home, he has been left with scarring, has difficulty sleeping and has to walk on his tiptoes as the skin on the back of his legs is so tight. Ms Devonshire, a cleaner, said she felt powerless being unable to comfort her son while he was in pain. She said: 'He was covered head to toe in bandages, like a mummy. 'You feel totally helpless, it's a feeling you only know if your child has been sick. I'm not religious but I prayed for Ben. 'I couldn't even give him a cuddle because he'd be left in agony.' Ben's symptoms first appeared as a red rash around his mouth, and then some spots across his body. At first Ms Devonshire didn't think it was anything to worry about. Ben's mother Annette Devonshire, 38, had to watch helplessly while her son spent three weeks in intensive care. 'I couldn't even give him a cuddle because he'd be left in agony' she said . Ben's rash, initially around his mouth and with a few spots on his chest, got worse and his entire body began to blister. Eventually he lost 99 per cent of his skin (his face is pictured left and his leg pictured right) Initially doctors said Ben had tonsillitis (right) but after the rash got worse he was eventually sent to intensive care. He has been left with scarring and has to sometimes walk on tiptoes as his skin is so tight . She said: 'I called the NHS line, but he seemed fine in himself still - he even went out for a bounce on the trampoline. 'That was at nine in the morning, but by three in the afternoon he was lying on the sofa poorly. 'I tried to take him to bed and he screamed in pain. She took Ben to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, where he was misdiagnosed with tonsillitis and sent away with antibiotics. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a widespread painful rash caused by bacteria. This germ produces a toxin that causes the outer layer of the skin to be shed. The toxin is removed by the immune system and the kidneys. If either is not working properly the toxin can circulate in the blood and can then affect most of the body’s surface. In young children, especially newborns, the immune system and kidneys are not fully developed, and this explains why they are most commonly affected. The original infection may be relatively minor, for example an infected graze or a red sticky eye. After a few days a widespread patchy red rash appears and rapidly joins up to cover most of the skin surface. Unlike most rashes it is painful and affected children are miserable and feverish and may not want to be held or touched. Soon there is loosening of skin, which can detach from the underlying layers, sometimes with easily-torn, fluid-filled blisters. If large areas of skin are shed, body fluid and salts can be lost causing dehydration, and further infection may get through into the bloodstream. The infection is treated with oral antibiotics, which in severe cases may be given through a vein. The skin needs gentle cleansing and soothing creams or dressings, which may include antibiotics or antiseptics. Special medical care is needed if fluid or salt balance is affected, or if there is a blood infection. Source: British Association of Dermatologists . Hours later his rash had spread and was starting to blister so Ms Devonshire rushed him back to the hospital. There, Ben was once again misdiagnosed, this time with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, an allergic reaction to antibiotics or epilepsy medicine which can cause a rash. Doctors took him off antibiotics, but in the morning, a new doctor - who instantly recognised it wasn't Steven-Johnson Syndrome but Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome - and shouted that he needed to be put back on medication immediately, Ms Devonshire claims. In most cases, SSSS  can be completely cured  if antibiotics are given in the early stages, but if large areas of skin are shed, body fluid and salts can be lost causing dehydration, and further infection may get through into the bloodstream. After being off antibiotics overnight, Ben now had to be sent to a specialist burns unit for treatment. Ms Devonshire said: 'Ben was off medication for about 18 hours. 'When the ward doctor came round the next morning he knew straight away what it was and screamed to get Ben back on antibiotics. 'By then it was too late and they had to decide whether he should go to Great Ormond Street or a specialist burns unit.' Ben was transferred to the burns unit at Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford. He spent three weeks in intensive care and a week on the general ward before being allowed home. Ms Devonshire said her son is still suffering and they expect he will have scars for life. She said: 'Ben is still really itchy at night and it stops him sleeping and makes him tired for school. It's a nuisance for him. 'He was first diagnosed with SSSS at the end of June and he's still suffering now. 'The bacteria got past the epidermal layer on his legs so he's still recovering and we expect there will be some scarring. 'He has to walk on his tip toes sometimes because the skin on the back of his legs is so tight. It's like he has really bad sunburn.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has admitted paying a banker £27million to stay silent over the tycoon's complex financial affairs. The billionaire had previously denied making any payment to Gerhard Gribkowsky, the German banker at the centre of a huge fraud trial. But yesterday he admitted to a packed Munich courtroom that he had paid him around £27million – because he was being blackmailed. Bernie Ecclestone (left) admitted paying Gerhard Gribkowsky (right) over his complex financial affairs despite his earlier denial . He claimed Gribkowsky was threatening to make false accusations to the Inland Revenue about his tax affairs which would cost him 'billions' even though he was innocent. Prosecutors have accused Mr Ecclestone, the fourth richest man in Britain, of paying the banker to fix a deal involving the sale of F1 shares on terms which were favourable to him. As a result of the deal arranged by Gribkowsky, Mr Ecclestone was paid five per cent commission – or £27million. But the F1 boss said a payment of £27million he subsequently made to Gribkowsky was because of the blackmail. Mr Ecclestone said he paid the banker the money not to do 'silly things'. He told the court: 'I really did not have any alternative. 'I was under the impression he might have given some information to the Revenue in England which I did not know much about. If he had done and the Revenue had investigated and been successful it would have been extremely expensive.' He added: 'My fear was he would do something. I thought I could keep him peaceful and quiet and not do silly things.' Ecclestone with his daughter, Tamara. His admission raises further questions about the flamboyant billionaire whose finances have long been shrouded in mystery . The admission that Mr Ecclestone, 81, . paid Gribkowsky will raise further questions about the business affairs . of the flamboyant billionaire, which have always been shrouded in . mystery. The tycoon has not been charged with any offence but his admission places him at the heart of the corruption case. It centres around the 2005 sale of F1 . shares by Gribkowsky's former employer, the German bank BayernLB, to . the London-based private equity group Citicorp Venture Capital, CVC. Gribkowsky, who engineered the deal, was charged with fraud after he was . found to have £27million in an Austrian bank account following the . deal's completion. Prosecutors claim this money was . given to him by Ecclestone as a bribe for securing favourable terms for . the F1 boss. Mr Ecclestone denies this. Following the sale of BayernLB's F1 . stake to CVC, Mr Ecclestone was appointed chief executive of the equity . group and was able to retain his controlling influence over F1. Mr Ecclestone said the £27million . commission he received was for facilitating the deal and giving the bank . assurances that F1 was in rude health. Mr Gribkowsky denies all charges against him. The case continues.","F1 supremo paid Gerhard Gribkowsky after the banker co-ordinated lucrative sale of Formula One .

"The family of a girl who was strangled by a teenage neighbor planning to steal her bike parts has launched a lawsuit, saying authorities could have done more to save her. Autumn Pasquale failed to return to her home in Clayton, New Jersey in October 2012, just days before her 13th birthday. Her disappearance prompted a massive search by officials and locals, but two days later, her body was found dumped in a recycling bin near to the home of Justin Robinson. Robinson, then 15, has since admitted to luring the young girl to his home to trade bicycle parts before strangling her by 'mistake'. Now Autumn's father and two siblings have launched a lawsuit against State Police, Gloucester County's Prosecutor Office and several townships, saying that they didn't search for her properly. Victim: Autumn Paquale was strangled by a teenager who had lured her to his home on the promise of trading bike parts. Her body was found in a recycling bin near to his home two days later . Devastated: Autumn's estranged parents, Jennifer Cornwell and Anthony Pasquale, are pictured in 2012. Autumn's estate - her father and two siblings - has sued authorities, saying that they didn't do enough . 'They didn't do the appropriate perimeter search,' family lawyer Gregg Zeff told the Inquirer. 'They were told specifically by someone who came in where he believed the child was, and they did not want to hear it. And, in fact, that's where she was.' The lawsuit claims law enforcement 'did not follow appropriate procedures,' including a canvass of the immediate area where the girl vanished, the Courier Post reported. 'If proper and adequate law enforcement techniques would have been employed in this matter, Autumn may have been discovered sooner and a reasonable chance exists that she would have survived,' the lawsuit says. Locked up: Justin Robinson is pictured leaving court last year after he pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and was sentenced to 17 years in prison. He was 15 when he killed the young girl . Accused: Robinson, left, and his brother Dante, right, were both arrested after their mother contacted police about a suspicious message she found. Dante later pleaded guilty to lesser charges and is out of jail . The family is seeking monetary damages - although specific amounts were not laid out - for each of seven counts: two counts of due process violations, a state-created danger, failure to train personnel, wrongful death, willful disregard and negligence, the Courier Post reported. The lawsuit adds that as well as losing their daughter, 'the parents have also lost any direct financial contributions, which would have been made by the child to her survivors after she became a wage earner'. It continues: 'They also lost the value of the child's anticipated services to survivors such as household chores and care of siblings.' It is not the first time the family has expressed their disdain at the police investigation. Last year, Autumn's father Anthony threatened to sue, claiming that prosecutor Sean Dalton's office botched the search. But Dalton handed the case over to the prosecutor in Camden County to avoid a legal conflict, the Inquirer reported. Dalton's office has previously said that Autumn was killed hours before she was reported missing. Found: An investigator takes away a bike from the boys' home that matches the description of the white BMX Autumn was seen riding. It emerged she had gone to the  house on the promise of trading bike parts . Autumn Pasquale vanished on October 20 after receiving a Facebook offer to trade bike parts and going to Justin Robinson's house several blocks from her family's home. Autumn was promised parts for her bike by Justin Robinson and his brother Dante, but the teenagers were really plotting to steal parts from her model, authorities said. When she didn't return home that night, her family - including her parents, who were estranged - and the community launched a frantic search. Two days later, her body was found in a recycling bin behind the home next to Robinson's. A break in the case came when the boy's mother, Anita Saunders, called police after seeing a Facebook post from one of her sons containing the word 'Autumn'. An autopsy concluded Autumn had died from 'blunt force trauma, consistent with strangulation'. She was also beaten. There was no evidence of sexual assault. Distraught: Her mother Jennifer Cornwell is pictured in court last year after making a victim impact statement . Loss: Autumn, pictured left with her mother and right, was remembered as a smiling tomboy and soccer fan . Justin Robinson pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter in August 2013 and admittted strangling the Clayton Middle School student. As he was sentenced to 17 years behind bars last year, he apologized to the family and said: 'This was not supposed to happen'. Prosecutors faced difficulties during the trial, including a lack of physical evidence to determine whether Justin or Dante killed Autumn. They also struggled to find a motive for the killing. But when he pleaded guilty, Justin Robinson said he acted alone. His brother Dante, later pleaded to lesser charges of fourth-degree obstruction. The older teen was sent to Camden County Youth Correction Facility but was released in September 2013 after he was sentenced to six months in jail and released with time served.","Autumn Pasquale was lured to Justin Robinson's New Jersey home in October 2012 after receiving a Facebook offer to trade bike parts .

"The dog is flat on his back, trussed up with a rough rope, his paws scrabbling frantically in the air as a man in a red baseball cap rams a needle deep into his heart. There is one last desperate struggle then a monstrous howl that rips  through the muggy tropical morning, startling nearby market traders and silencing the birds. When the howl splutters into a whimper, the dog is dragged and kicked into a kennel to die alongside three others. It is a slow and painful death, the result of a botched lethal injection by a canine-killing squad. Squalid: A dog jumps up looking for its owner. He is on death row at the dog pound in Port Louis, Mauritius. Eighty per cent of the dogs caught and killed are pet dogs not strays . And it takes place in the so-called tropical paradise of Mauritius — the palm-fringed holiday destination of more than 200,000 Britons each year. Away from the white, gleaming beaches — where the sea is impossibly blue and tourists sip cocktails while lazing on luxury sunbeds — more than 20,000 pet and stray dogs are slayed annually in this sickening way. These horrific images of the slaughter were taken during an undercover investigation by the Mail after the alarm was raised by the British-based charity International Animal Rescue. The Mauritian government claims it is a humane way of controlling the island’s stray dog population, but it is neither humane nor honest. Cruel:  An MSPCA dog catcher nets a dog before throwing it into the van where it will be taken off to the pound . Death sentence: When it arrives at the pound the dog has three days . before it is thrown into a mass grave at the grave yard in Port . Louis . Some of the animals are strays but many more — up to 80 per cent — are much-loved pets that have been snatched from their doorsteps, with collars and security tags clearly marking their addresses. They are captured as part of a ‘clean-up’ campaign, despite pleas from animal welfare organisations across the world. And they are killed by an organisation with a name so ironic it would be laughable it wasn’t true — the Mauritian Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Kitted out in jaunty red caps and wielding giant fishing nets, MSPCA dog-catchers snatch animals wherever they see them — sleeping on street corners, lingering in alleys or lazing on their own doorsteps. They are scooped up and hurled into cages in the back of roasting-hot vans where they remain — often bleeding and with broken bones — while the officers continue their rounds. Caged: MSPCA personnel march around in heavy boots, brandishing sharp metal rods to punish disobedient animals. In the filthy concrete cages, most of the dogs shrink to the back, shivering and terrified . Their destination is a pound that can only be described as a concentration camp for dogs.MSPCA personnel march around in heavy boots, brandishing sharp metal rods to punish disobedient animals. In the filthy concrete cages, most of the dogs shrink to the back, shivering and terrified. Others edge forward, hopeful and trusting, unable to understand their predicament. The worst corner is the puppy cage — rusty, squalid with faeces, and utterly desolate. Only animals with owners have any hope, and even then it is slim. If residents suspect their pet has been snatched by the MSPCA, they can come to the pound and pay a ransom to rescue it. But the charge is £30, which is beyond the reach of most people, as the average worker earns less than £60 a month. Nearly all the dogs spend three days in the cages before a lethal injection and a slow, painful death. The still-warm bodies are hurled into a mass open grave in a stretch of wasteland. Clumps of fur, tails and ears are visible in the red soil. Skulls and bones create splashes of white. The MSPCA insists only stray dogs are exterminated but this is a lie. The truth is that the organisation has a quota of more than 100 stray dogs to capture every day in a bid to reduce the island’s estimated 200,000 population. Helpless: The worst corner is the puppy cage - rusty, squalid with . faeces, and utterly desolate. Only animals with owners have any hope, . and even then it is slim . And officers will happily take pets to achieve this figure. British woman Alicia Browne can testify to this, after her two dogs were snatched while she was walking them. Alicia, who is staying in Mauritius for nine months to visit a friend, adopted two stray dogs — whom she called Mira and Wanda — on the waterfront near Riv du Rempart in the north-east. She recalls: ‘I was with them on the beach in December, throwing sticks, just having a nice day, when these two guys ran down with their nets and threw them over Mira and Wanda. ‘I screamed, “What are you doing! These are my dogs!” Mira and Wanda could not have been more than 4ft away from me. But one of the dog-catchers said I was breaking the law: because they weren’t on a leash, they were strays, and that was that.’ Alicia, from Redhill, Surrey, adds: . ‘I was in tears and ran after them and saw them dumped in the van like . trash. Mira’s leg was cut — you can see the scars and she has a limp . now. ‘I followed the van in . my car for the rest of the morning while the men scooped up pet after . pet then went to the pound where they were unloaded. ‘I had to pay to get my dogs back. Wanda will never be the same again — she was severely traumatised by the experience.’ Jacqueline . Woodridge, a British expat living in Mauritius, lost her pet dog in . January and went to the Port Louis MSPCA compound to try to find him. Lucky ones: Alicia Browne (35) from Redhill Surrey with her two dogs . Wanda (left) and Mira (right) who she saved from the dog pound after the dog catchers snatched her pets from the beach. Her search was unsuccessful — and shocking. She said: ‘What I saw was horrific. There were so many beautiful dogs, many, many with collars, including puppies, squeezed into dirty kennel chambers covered with urine and faeces. ‘They were trembling, whining, and terrified. There was just one bowl of bread and water in each kennel.’ While the population of strays is undoubtedly large and growing, the dogs are not dangerous: there is no rabies on Mauritius, and the strays shun human contact. Local and international vets agree that sterilisation would stem the problem — indeed, three years ago French actress Brigitte Bardot offered to pay for a mass sterilisation for all the island’s strays. But the government will not consider it. Yesterday, phone calls to the MSPCA were not returned. German vet Birgit Wellmann, who had to rescue her own dog from a pound, said: Sterilisation is the way forward but no one will listen. It is heartbreaking.’ She claims people on the island won’t criticise the MSPCA for fear of veiled retribution. Foreigners worry about losing residency and work permits, and locals are vulnerable to arrest if they defame the government. Authorities say the strays are an eyesore and jeopardise the lucrative tourism trade. But as one European vet who used to work on the island points out: ‘For most tourists, these dogs are less dangerous than sunburn.’","More than 20,000 pet and stray dogs are brutally slayed annually in Mauritius .

"Lucy Richards was diagnosed with the rare womb disorder placenta previa while pregnant with her daughter Demi . A young mother was forced to have a hysterectomy at just 21 after suffering a rare womb disorder which caused severe bleeding during her pregnancy. Doctors feared nine times that Lucy Richards would miscarry her baby, before her daughter was delivered safely via C-section. She lost six pints of blood and drifted out of consciousness as her daughter Demi was born. At 36 weeks pregnant, doctors diagnosed Miss Richards with the condition placenta previa. This is where the placenta grows into the lower part of the womb, causing heavy bleeding. As doctors delivered her baby, the condition caused her womb to begin to disintegrate, leaving surgeons no option other than to perform a hysterectomy. Without the drastic operation, the 21-year-old would not have survived to raise her daughter. She said: 'I had always dreamed of having a big family. I wanted four kids. 'Giving birth was traumatising and I lost my womb during labour. 'I can never have any more children, but one smile from my beautiful daughter is enough to make me realise that it was all worth it.' Miss Richards, from Warrington, became pregnant when she was 19 years old. She conceived despite using the contraceptive pill and the morning after pill. She said: 'At that time I had no plans to start a family. I knew I would have plenty of time to have babies, so I was in no rush to get pregnant.' Miss Richards discovered she was pregnant only when she was rushed to hospital after she began bleeding uncontrollably at work. Doctors told her she was five weeks pregnant and in the midst of suffering a miscarriage. She said: 'I was terrified. I'd been in a meeting and I suddenly started bleeding. I was completely shocked when they told me I was pregnant.' Doctors were able to save her unborn child and bring the bleeding under control. But over the next 14 weeks the expectant mother suffered the early stages of a miscarriage another eight times. Miss Richards said: 'I didn't know what was happening - but I was terrified I would lose my baby. 'I hadn't planned to have children for another ten years and now I was carrying a little life inside me. 'As soon as I knew I was having a baby my mothering instinct kicked in and I was determined to fight for it. 'I couldn't even consider having an abortion, she'd been through so much - it was obvious she was desperate to live. It was awful, but eventually I was told the baby was safe and healthy.' The 21-year-old did not know she was pregnant and only discovered she was expecting after suffering heavy bleeding at work. Doctors told her she was five weeks pregnant and in the midst of a miscarriage. But they managed to bring the bleeding under control and saved her unborn child's life . At 36 weeks Miss Richards was diagnosed with placenta previa, which causes the placenta to grow in the lower part of the womb causing severe bleeding. As a result doctors said she would need a C-section to deliver her daughter. Miss Richards lost six litres of blood during delivery, forcing doctors to perform a hysterectomy . Without the life-saving operation, Miss Richards would not have survived to bring up her now six-month-old daughter Demi, pictured . In April, when she was 36 weeks pregnant, Miss Richards was diagnosed with placenta previa. The complication, which affects one in 250 labours, causes the placenta to grow into the lower part of an expectant mother's womb, causing vaginal bleeding. On April 22, Miss Richards went into labour three weeks early and was rushed into theatre for an urgent Caesarean section. Placenta previa occurs when the baby's placenta partially or totally covers the opening of the mother's cervix. The condition can cause severe bleeding before and during labour. The placenta provides oxygen and nutrients to an unborn baby. In most pregnancies, it attaches at the top or side of the uterus. Where a woman is suffering placenta previa, it attaches to the lower area of the placenta. Sufferers normally require a Caesarean section to safely deliver their baby. The placenta grows wherever the embryo implants itself in the uterus. Placenta previa is caused when the embryo implants in the lower part of the womb. Women are at greater risk of the condition if they have had previous surgeries invloving the uterus, including a C-section or removal of uterine fibroids. It is also more common in women who have had at least one child, the condition before, women carrying multiple pregnancies, those aged 35 or older, those who smoke and those who use cocaine. Source: Mayo Clinic . She said: 'Doctors said if I gave birth naturally it would kill me and the baby so I had to have a Caesarean. 'When my waters broke I was really scared. I went to hospital and doctors rushed me straight into surgery.' After her daughter was born Miss Richard's slipped in and out of consciousness as she lost nearly six pints of blood. When she regained consciousness doctors told her that they had attempted to remove her placenta but her womb had started to disintegrate, causing haemorrhaging. Her placenta had fused itself to her cervix and hip and an emergency hysterectomy was required to save her life. She said: 'The doctors and surgeons were rushing around me. One told me I would have to have to have my womb removed or I would die.' After a night in intensive care Miss Richards finally held her daughter Demi Alice Richards. She said: 'The day I gave birth was the worst day of my life - but the day I finally held my daughter was the best. 'I can hardly put into words what it felt like. She was so tiny and perfect.' Now six months on, baby Demi said her first word last Thursday. 'Her first word was 'Mama' - it felt awesome to hear,' said Miss Richards. 'I'm lucky to have survived through labour, but the chance to have more children has been taken from me. 'I still have my ovaries so I will look to other options like surrogacy and womb transplants in the future. 'But right now I want to focus on raising the daughter I'm lucky to have.'","Lucy Richards was diagnosed with the rare womb disorder placenta previa .

"It was acceptable in the Eighties. And now bright, eccentric jewellery from the decade of shoulder pads is making a comeback. Giant hoop and drop earrings, extravagant torque bangles and sprung-collar necklaces were all the rage among power-dressing women more than 25 years ago. The look, which is characterised by abstract design, yellow gold and colourful stones, was soon seen as tasteless but is now back in fashion, according to one auction house. Bright, eccentric jewellery from the decade of shoulder pads is making a comeback. Pictured here: A fine diamond and sapphire Claw dress ring, signed by Marina B, popular among 80s power-dressing women . Bonhams has reported a surge in customers paying above estimate prices for the over-the-top jewellery. Recent sales include £11,000 for an amethyst and ametrine choker, and £17,000 for a moonstone and gem set necklace, both by US designer Tony Duquette.

Jean Ghika, head of jewellery in the UK and Europe at Bonhams, said: 'The beauty of the Eighties is that for many people it is still seen as the time that fashion forgot. 'There is definitely a feeling these designs have been unappreciated, even as recently as four or five years ago. 'Obviously that view is now changing when it comes to jewellery. 'Much of the jewellery from the Art Deco period is meant to be worn exclusively in the evening with a formal dress. 'But big, bold and stylish Eighties jewellery, with its unmistakable mix of stones and vibrant colour palette can be easily worn both during the day and at night. 'That makes it a versatile option for the time-poor business woman. 'Now is definitely the moment to dig out any Eighties jewellery you might have hidden away in a box and have a look. It could be worth trying on again or selling if you're still not convinced.' Bonhams has compared sale figures of Eighties jewellery in 2010 versus this year and found pieces were now achieving an average of 70 per cent higher than estimated. In some cases, the final price was 200 per cent higher than it was four years ago. By comparison, some stunning lots of signed Eighties jewellery on sale in 2010 failed to reach their reserves, despite now being highly sought after and commanding top prices.

"Pictured with his first bike in 1954, Nick Thomas spent six months in the 60s hitch-hiking from Sydney to Magnetic Island at only 16 . At 16 years of age, with less than two pence to his name and only his best mate beside him, Nick Thomas set out to hitch-hike 2000km from Sydney to Magnetic Island in Queensland. Over the next six months the two teenagers, who sought a promised fortune, came face-to-face with the kooky characters and unique landscapes that made-up Australia's outback in the 1960s. More than 50 years later, Mr Thomas' memories and diary entries from the time have been published into the book Once A Pommie Swagman; a memoir of sorts which celebrates and looks 'back at a time and a way of life that no longer exists'. 'It was the characters who got me writing the book,' Mr Thomas told Daily Mail Australia, 'the characters are worth remembering.' From stealing food, crashing cars, picking fruit, camping by the roadside, hitch-hiking with truck drivers and farm widows, being thrown into jail and being taken in and fed by families who were 'flabbergasted to see two boys travelling on their own'- the book records a range of mischief in which the two boys partook. Mr Thomas explained how in an era of unlocked front doors, he and his childhood friend Glen learnt to survive on the road while stealthily taking showers in random pubs in the early hours of the morning. The teenager (pictured here in 1959 at Epping Boys High School, bottom row, very centre) went on the adventure alongside with only two pence to his name and only his best mate Glen by his side . 'We would just go up the resident stairs and walk along the corridor to have a shower – and you'd wash your clothes while you're doing it,' Mr Thomas said. 'We got caught up in Julia Creek though, which was a bit traumatic. This bloke came out of a room down near the stairs at the bottom of the hall – the toilets were always at the far end of the hall, you see – wearing a pair of underpants and a blue singlet, just your typical country Australian. 'He called out ""What room are you two in?"" and I just quickly answered ""14"". 'His arm instantly shot out towards the back of my neck and smashed me into the wall when I said that. ""14 my arse!"" Of course, there were only nine rooms in the hotel. More than 50 years later, Mr Thomas (pictured with his elder sister Sally) has published his memories from the trip in the book Once A Pommie Swagman . With his father and sister at Avoca beach in 1953: The book details all the mischief the two boys got up to including  stealing food, crashing cars, camping by the roadside, and being thrown into jail . 'We had to paint the roof of the hotel for that and of course there was drama to follow with that because Glen was afraid of heights.' However, the book serves as a record of more sombre times in Australia too; an era when the country still directed hate and prejudice towards both immigrants and Aboriginal people. 'Australia still had a white Australia policy then – racially vilifying and and insulting foreigners was common. Whether you were Japanese or Italian or a Pom, it didn't matter, we were all insulted. The book is also a reflection of that, not in a bitter or resentful way, that's just how it was,' Mr Thomas said. It recalls a particularly appalling example of this attitude directed towards an Aboriginal man which was witnessed by Nick and Glen just outside Charters Towers in Northern Queensland as they tried to light a fire by the side of the road. Mr Thomas with his sister Sally and father and myself in 1949 (left) and dressed as a 'bush musician' for the school fete in 1955 (right) 'We were just sitting on side of road when suddenly a police car came and stopped about 200 yards away from us and a cop got out and dragged out an Aboriginal man who was just paralytic drunk,' Mr Thomas recalled. Army recruit training in Ingleburn, NSW, in 1962 at age 18: Mr Thomas fought in the Vietnam War and developed post-traumatic stress disorder . 'He pushed him out the side of car and punched him in his stomach and we heard him yell ""and stay out,"" presumably as he was kicking him out of town. Then he looked around and kicked the Aborigine in the groin and just drove off. 'We had been hiding, but when we got up to see how the Aboriginal man was, the cop had seen us and he drove back and gave us a grilling. We were vagrants so he was saying things like ""I can arrest you at any time"", ""I'll arrest you for resisting arrest"" and ""if anyone hears about this, I'll know who told them"".' Nick adventures came to an abrupt end when his mother arrived from New Guinea after speaking to his sister, who he contacted regularly. Determined to make something of her son, 'she took me by the ear lobe and dragged me to the recruiting office and I joined the army,' Mr Thomas said. From that moment onward, life took on a different tone for Mr Thomas, who fought in the Vietnam War and developed a debilitating version of post-traumatic stress disorder that would haunt him for the next 40 years. He spent 10 and a half months on the ground with only four days break, in what he describes as necessary 'rifle gripping tension'. 'Even at the base camp which was portrayed as 'easy with steaks and beer', every time we went outside the wire someone came back minus a foot or dead. 182 people were wounded and 25 men were lost, that's almost one every one and a half days so that keeps you alert and tense,' he said. 'It does things to you and you need to have this tension to keep you watchful and alert and alive. Once you've got into that mode it's not an easy function to turn off.' Due to understanding the struggles associated with returning from war, Mr Thomas is donating a portion of the sales from Once A Pommie Swagman to war veteran associations. Reminiscing of simpler times, he admitted that he had attempted to retrace his steps 14 years after his journey in 1975 alongside his wife Veronica. However, none of the characters that made the adventure such an enduring memory were still there.","Nick Thomas spent six months hitch-hiking from Sydney to Magnetic Island alongside his best friend when he was 16-years-old .

"Hot-stepping his way into the hallowed halls of Downton Abbey, the popular ITV drama's newest star Jack Ross made quite the impression when he made his debut on Sunday night's episode. Audiences had been eagerly awaiting the jazz singer's first appearance, and although Ross looks set to shake up the Crawleys, his antics will likely pale in comparison to those of the real-life musician on who Downton's newest resident is said to be based. The show's first black character, played by actor Gary Carr, is thought to have been inspired by Leslie 'Hutch' Hutchinson - the Twenties cabaret star who charmed a string of women, and became embroiled in a scandal with Edwina Mountbatten, Countess Mountbatten of Burma. Scroll down for video . Newest star: Jazz singer Jack Ross, said to be based on Leslie 'Hutch' Hutchinson made his Downton debut on Sunday night . First impressions: It remains to be seen if Jack Ross, played by actor Gary Carr, makes the same impact on Lady Rose as real-life singer Hutch had on the women of the 1920s . Huge star: Singer Leslie 'Hutch' Hutchinson found fans among the rich and famous including the Prince of Wales and infamously Edwina Mountbatten . As one of the biggest stars in Britain during the 1920s and 1930s, Hutch lived the life of an upper-crust aristocrat - enjoying hunting, fishing and trips to Savile Row in his chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce, according to the Daily Telegraph newspaper. He found fans among the rich and famous, including the then Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII, and infamously Edwina, the wife of the Prince's cousin Lord Louis Mountbatten, much to the horror of her royal in-laws. Downton's creator, Julian Fellowes, may find that some of Hutch's escapades prove a little too much for cosy Sunday evening audiences - one of his boasts that may not make the Downtown storylines was that he had a larger 'endowment' than any other man on earth. Born Leslie Arthur Julien Hutchinson in Grenada in March 1900, Hutch moved to New York as a teenager to study for a degree in medicine, but became sidetracked when he started playing the piano and singing in bars. Instant attraction: Wealthy Edwina Mountbatten, married to the Prince of Wales' cousin, was introduced to the talented young singer following a performance of his West End show One Dam' Thing . After moving to Paris to further his musical career, in 1927 he found himself in London where he swiftly became a society darling, and was for a time the highest-paid star in the country. Despite his success, Hutch found that his rise to the top was hindered by the prejudice of British society at the time, and as a black man he was barred from sharing a stage with white women. His West End show One Dam' Thing, which boasted costumes designed by Coco Chanel, garnered fantastic reviews - despite the fact that Variety magazine would not include his name in them. Hutch was one of the first stars in Britain to volunteer to entertain the troops at home and abroad during World War II, but he received no formal recognition for his service, and his name would never appear in any Honours list. When he entertained at lavish Mayfair parties, his fee was large, but he was often obliged to go in by the servants' entrance. It was during his performances in One Dam' Thing that Hutch first attracted the attention of his royal fans, after the Prince of Wales, Lord Mountbatten - and Edwina - were watching from the theatre's boxes on opening night. Wealthy Edwina, the daughter of King Edward VII's banker Sir Ernest Cassel, was said to be instantly enthralled and at the post-show party she was introduced to the talented young singer, according to biographer Charlotte Breese. A few nights later Hutch, who was himself married to wife Ella Bird, was said to have sung directly to Edwina when he performed a late-night set at a London nightspot. Screen icons: Hutch enjoyed affairs with high-profile actresses Tallulah Bankhead, left, and Merle Oberon, right . 'He sang directly to Edwina,' Ms Breese said in the Daily Telegraph. '[She] took off her chiffon scarf and put it round his neck and kissed him while he was playing.' At the time Hutch was living with society belle Zena Naylor, and had enjoyed affairs with screen sirens Tallulah Bankhead and Merle Oberon, as well as another bright young thing, 'Babe' Plunkett Greene. The West End's leading matinee idol, Ivor Novello, was also rumoured to have been one of bisexual Hutch's lovers, and in 1930 Hutch made debutante Elizabeth Corbett pregnant. When the child was black Elizabeth's Guards-officer husband was appalled, and the baby was given up for adoption. None of that seemed to deter Edwina, however, with one BBC producer Bobby Jay telling Ms Breese: 'I was at a grand party. 'Edwina interrupted Hutch playing the piano. She kissed his neck and led him by the hand behind the closed doors of the dining-room. There was a shriek, and a few minutes later she returned, straightening her clothes. 'Hutch seemed elated, and before he returned to the piano, told me that, with one thrust, he had flashed [propelled] her the length of the dining-room table.' Edwina was said to have showered Hutch with presents, including a jewelled gold cigarette case, a gold ring with her coat of arms engraved on the inside, and a gold and diamond watch. She was even thought to have commissioned a jewelled sheath for Hutch's aforementioned manhood. The singer would proudly show off the sheath to his fellow musicians. Although the affair caught the attention of American gossip columnists, the British press were doing their best to ignore the scandal, even when Hutch took Edwina with him to perform for inmates at Dartmoor prison. Happier times: Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, married wife Edwina in July 1922 . Eventually, in 1932, The People newspaper cracked. It launched a thinly veiled attack on a 'leading hostess' who was been 'caught in compromising circumstances' with a black man. Many took the article to mean that Edwina was having a relationship with another black singer, Paul Robeson, and the resulting High Court libel case caused a furore when Edwina boldly told how she had never met Robeson - which he confirmed. Facing the wrath of the King, The People eventually backed down and shelled out damages to charity, with its barrister Sir Patrick Hastings forced to make a grovelling apology - 'genuine and deep regrets' - on behalf of the newspaper's owners. The Mountbattens were invited to lunch at Buckingham Palace the next day in a public show of marital solidarity. New arrival: Audiences have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of Downton Abbey's new character Jack Ross . Though still a celebrity, without his royal approval Hutch began to fall from grace. He was dropped from BBC radio shows and found that he could no longer win bookings at many theatres. He was struggling to make ends meet and when his wife Ella died in 1958 she was buried in an unmarked pauper's grave at a cost of £12. By that time, he had six children by different mothers, and was to father a seventh at the age of 64.With his fortune squandered on gambling, he was forced to sell his house in 1967 for £13,037. Of this, £10,000 went to pay off his debts, leaving him just £3,000 out of the millions he had earned.On August 18, 1969, he died 'virtually penniless' at the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, from 'overwhelming pneumonia' at the age of 69. He left £1,949 and no will. Only 42 mourners showed up at his funeral.","Downton character Jack Ross based on singer Leslie 'Hutch' Hutchinson .

"The man accused of killing his girlfriend's mother and stuffing her body in a suitcase allegedly lashed out after the 62-year-old used a racial slur against him. Tommy Schaefer, 21, is said to have attacked Sheila von Wiese-Mack in their Bali hotel on holiday from Chicago after she used the N-word, Indonesian police say. The claim came from her mixed-race daughter Heather Mack, 19, who is also being held as a suspect. Neither have been formally charged. Scroll down for video . Racial dispute? Heather Mack, 19, (left) claims her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21 (right), killed her white mother after the 62-year-old used the N-word to refer to him and her late husband jazz musician James L Mack . Attack: Police say Schaefer hit Sheila von Wiese-Mack, from Chicago, with the iron handle of a fruit bowl . Schaefer is black, as was Mack's father James L Mack - a highly regarded jazz and classical composer who died in 2006. According to police detective chief Captain Nengah Sadiarta, Mack told them that Schaefer became angry when von Wiese-Mack - who was white - called him the N-word, and killed her while Mack watched in their hotel room. When Schaefer brought up her late husband's race, von-Weise-Mack  used the N-word again but added that James Mack was also rich, the 19-year-old allegedly told police. The badly beaten body of von Wiese-Mack was found stuffed in a suitcase inside the trunk of a taxi at the St. Regis Bali Resort in August. Sadiarta said police filed their dossiers at the prosecutor's office in Denpasar, the capital of Bali, on Monday but are continuing to investigate. Suspect: Heather Mack, pictured at the police headquarters in Bali, is a suspect but not formally charged . Details: Mack confessed to police that Schaefer beat her mother but did not say if it was intended for murder . Family: Heather and Sheila, from Chicago, were on holiday together on the Indonesian island . Raja Nasution, an Indonesian lawyer for Mack, said he and her U.S. lawyer accompanied her during questioning. He confirmed the police account of the racial slur being used, but added that Mack did not specifically say she saw Schaefer kill her mother. 'She did not mention murder, but she told investigators that Tommy did the beating,' Nasution said. 'Our client did not mention that the beating was intended to kill her mother or not. She just confessed to the police that Tommy beat her mother.' Nasution also said Mack told police she did not kill von Wiese-Mack or help stuff her body into the suitcase. Haposan Sihombing, a lawyer who has represented Schaefer, said Friday that he could not comment because Schaefer replaced him a day earlier. He refused to give the name of Schaefer's new lawyer. Sihombing, however, denied that Schaefer had confessed to killing von Wiese-Mack, as Denpasar's police chief, Col. Djoko Hari Utomo, said last month. Utomo has since said he intended to say that Mack told police that Schaefer was responsible. Scene: Police laid out pieces of evidence in the parking lot including bloodied sheets and pillows from the room . Killed: von Wiese-Mack's body was found in the suitcase at the luxury resort in Indonesia in August . Sadiarta said the hotel's surveillance camera video shows that Schaefer took a piece of iron from his room and hid it under his shirt as he went to von Wiese-Mack's room. He said the iron appeared to be the grip of a fruit bowl provided by the hotel in his room, and investigators found bits of iron matching the piece in the victim's wound. The captain said the surveillance video shows that no one but Mack and Schaefer went in and out of von Wiese-Mack's room in the hours surrounding her death. He said Mack was seen in the video bringing a cart to von Wiese-Mack's room to transport the suitcase that contained her mother's body. Police have said that Mack and Schaefer hired a taxi, placed the suitcase in its trunk and disappeared. Hotel staff noticed spots of blood on the suitcase and told the driver to go to a police station, where officers opened the suitcase and discovered the body. Sadiarta also said police found a jacket belonging to Schaefer with blood spots when police caught him at another Bali hotel. Lab results showed that the blood matched von Wiese-Mack's blood.","Heather Mack, 19, told Indonesian police her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, killed her mother Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62, after  N-word row .

"To Ramazan Culum’s mind, it was the ultimate declaration of love. To win the heart of a young British waitress he had met in Cyprus seven years earlier, the Turkish businessman set off on an eight-month odyssey in a tiny yacht, braving stormy seas and travelling 2,500 miles to track her down. The only problem was that the object of his affections, Courtney Murray, had never indicated any interest in him, and in fact had fled her job in Cyprus to escape his disturbing and persistent overtures. Obsessive quest for romance: Turkish sailor Ramazan Noyan Culum (left) embarked on a fruitless eight-month, 2,500-mile voyage to track down his 'holiday sweetheart' Courtney Murray, whom he met in Cyprus in 2005 . Tiny yacht: Culum made his voyage in the 'Ninova', a 16ft long vessel, pictured on the left in Plymouth with a border patrol boat . This was not enough to deter Culum, . however, from a quest that has seen him arrested, lose his job as a . company director and, as he put it, get banned from ‘more countries than . Osama Bin Laden’. His bizarre journey has now been . brought to an abrupt end after he was arrested in a British port on . Friday and told he will be deported. The 38-year-old’s obsession is said . to have begun in 2005 when he met Miss Murray while on a scuba-diving . trip in Northern Cyprus, where she was working in a cafe. Although she took ‘no interest’ in . Culum and served him just the once, he is said to have stolen her phone . number from the cafe’s wall and began harassing her. Her friends claim Culum showed up at . the restaurant several times – once wielding a knife so he could ‘take . her’ – and was eventually arrested and deported from Cyprus. Miss Murray . was apparently so terrified she returned to her home, thought to be in . Liverpool, where she eventually married. Infatuation: Culum, a businessman (pictured here with another woman) became obsessed with Murray after she served him in a Cypriot restaurant when he was on a scuba diving holiday in 2005 . Happier times: Culum (seated fourth from left) set off from the port of Bodrum in April and spent eight months at sea before being detained near Plymouth on Friday . In early 2011, Culum was still . refusing to give up, and tracked Miss Murray down on Facebook, only for . her promptly to block him from contacting her on the site. Undeterred, he set off from Bodrum, . Turkey, in April this year, after writing on his online blog that he . aimed to marry Miss Murray – despite admitting she ‘abhorred’ him. During his epic voyage, Culum is . thought to have been arrested in both Italy and Spain because he didn’t . have the correct papers. He also battled stormy seas in the Adriatic and . the Mediterranean, getting hypothermia at one point. He negotiated the Strait of . Gibraltar, and sailed along the coast of Spain and across the Bay of . Biscay before heading north towards the English Channel. On his blog, Culum says he has been . imprisoned, gone on a hunger strike and spent time in a mental hospital . since the chance encounter with Miss Murray. Quest for love: Culum travelled from Bodrum in Turkey to Plymouth . Long voyage: The sailor documented his 2,500-mile journey, aboard a 16ft yacht, on a blog, posting a number of pictures of the countries he visited . The website, entitled ‘Hunger Strike . for Courtney Murray: The world is not beautiful without you’, states . that he has been deported from Cyprus nine times. He wrote: ‘You stupid girl, you . didn’t understand why I come to the UK. I will come there, I will kneel . down in front of you. I will kiss your hands and I will propose marrying . me. You can marry me or you can imprison me. It’s yours to decide.’ Culum, once a successful businessman . and CEO of a mobile phone games firm, claimed he was ‘ready to die’ on . his way to reach Britain. He added: ‘Please accept my proposal . and give me a family. I have only one sister. My father and my mother . are both died. Courtney, marry me, why don’t you accept?  I come.’ Tracked: His online blog featured a photograph of Murray and a map charting his progress across Europe . In his latest entry two days ago, he . wrote: ‘I did never dream to immigrate but was trying to gain the heart . of the angel of my life. ‘But I’m now at an immigration centre. I’m not happy of course. I love you, excuse me please.’ Miss Murray’s friends and family left comments on his blog posts calling him a ‘fruitcake stalker’. One post in April, from her Aunt . Florence, read: ‘If you ever make it to the UK and make contact with . Courtney the police will be informed immediately. 'Courtney is married . and happy – all you are doing is making yourself a fool and upsetting . Courtney and her family. Hunger strike: This was the 'proposal' posted on Culum's blog . ‘This is to your family and friends . who are supposed to love and support you: GET HIM HELP! He sounds like . he is totally off his head and a danger to himself and to Courtney.’ Another post, from a friend, said: . ‘I’m so sick of you upsetting and distressing my pal. All you are to her . is a fruitcake stalker... so either go home or drown.’ The Home Office confirmed a . 38-year-old man in a 16-foot yacht, Ninova, was intercepted by the . Border Force cutter HMC Valiant late on Friday in the sea off Devon. Peter Jones, of Border Force, said: . ‘This man was attempting to enter the UK without a visa or valid . passport but was stopped and will now be removed to his home country.’ Defiant: Culum continued to update his webpage with messages such as this one despite Murray's family leaving comments urging him to give up his quest . Deportation: Murray had caused Culum to be kicked out of more countries than 'Osama Bin Laden', he wrote .","Ramazan Noyan Culum, 38, embarked on 2,500-mile voyage to find 'holiday sweetheart' Courtney Murray .

"While people might generally think of the average Aussie male as tall, lean and well-built, research shows that perception is wide of the mark. In fact, the average Mr Australia has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 27, which is comfortably in the overweight category, and not far off being classified as clinically obese. Researcher, and graphic designer, Nickolay Lamm, from Pittsburgh, US, compared the bodies of Mr Average from around the globe, as part of a body measurement project. So how does Mr Oz size up? The following graphic looks at the size of the average Australian man compared to his counterpart from USA, the Netherlands, France and Japan . Many see the typical Aussie male as being tall and muscular, like Hugh Jackman, pictured here in Sydney . Average Aussie male stands at 175.6cm tall and hits the scales at 85.9kg, giving him a BMI of 27, which is smack bang in the middle of the overweight category . The Average Mr Australia stands at 175.6cm tall and hits the scales at 85.9 kilograms, leaving him with a BMI of 27, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It's far from the rippling image of Chris Hemmsworth or Hugh Jackman, but the average Aussie is still leaner than Mr America, whose BMI is 29 and stands up at 176.4cm, reports Sydney Morning Herald. Mr Japan is the healthiest, with a BMI of 23. Mr Netherlands stands at 183.3cm and a BMI of 25.2, while France comes in at 25.5 at 174.4 cm. The results highlight the growing threat of obesity in Australia, which increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and increased blood pressure. While the average Aussie male might not be as buff as he's often perceived, another recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences revealed super-muscular male body types seen in Hollywood are not attractive in some cultures. For example, in South America,  softer, more feminine looking men are perceived as more attractive. Last year, graphic artist and researcher Nickolay Lamm used data of the average American woman to create a graphic of an average barbie, then pictured her next to a standard barbie . It's not the first time that Nickolay Lamm, 24, has endeavoured to reshape body image perceptions. Last year, he used the measurement of an average American women to create a graphic of a barbie with these proportions, then pictured her next to a traditional barbie. Scaled up to human size, Mr Lamm found Barbie was grossly disproportionate and would have a BMI of 16.24, which is considered  severely anorexic. The study reignited the sentiment that the doll was promoting unhealthy body image in girls. Lamm spoke out about the artwork, saying 'If we criticise skinny models, we should at least be open to the possibility that Barbie may negatively influence young girls as well.'","Quintessential Australian male often thought of as tall, lean and well-built .

"Former Missouri Republican congressman Todd Akin made the claim that some people working on his campaign team had been conceived by rape as he once again attempted to justify his controversial remarks about 'legitimate rape' on MSNBC on Thursday. During the 2012 U.S. Senate campaign Akin’s controversial rape comments caused a national outrage, which lost him the support of senior Republicans and ultimately cost him his seat. In his new book, Firing Back: Taking On The Party Bosses And Media Elite To Protect Our Faith And Freedom., Akin attempts to set the record straight and also writes that he regrets ever apologizing in a television commercial. Former Missouri Republican congressman Todd Akin made the claim that some people working on his campaign team had been conceived by rape as he once again attempted to justify his controversial remarks about 'legitimate rape' on MSNBC on Thursday . Speaking on MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown to promote his book on Thursday, Akin admitted he had used a poor choice of words in 2012, but stood by his argument that ‘legitimate rape’ rarely caused pregnancy and said he had worked with people who were conceived by rape. ‘I had number of people on my campaign that were children that were conceived in rape - helping me on the campaign,’ he said. 'I believe that little children are special,' he also told host Chuck Todd. It was during an interview with a local TV reporter in 2012, that Akin asserted that rape victims are less likely to get pregnant because ‘the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.’ In his new political memoir Akin writes that his wife Lulli was the only person in his team who objected to him filming an apology ad over his rape comments . In his new book, Firing Back: Taking On The Party Bosses And Media Elite To Protect Our Faith And Freedom., Akin attempts to set the record straight over his 'legitimate rape' remark . The 67-year-old Akin, who spent 12 years in Congress and another dozen as a state lawmaker, lost to Democrat Claire McCaskill. In a new political memoir Akin writes that his remarks on whether abortion should be legal in cases of rape were taken out of context and led to his 'political assassination' and betrayal by GOP allies. The 209-page book includes a foreword by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who, like Akin, criticizes Republican leaders for abandoning the candidate soon after his remarks garnered national attention and almost immediately dominated the campaign. Some blamed Akin - who resisted calls to drop out of the race - for costing Republicans a chance to gain a majority in the Senate. Akin writes he believes stress can affect a woman's ability to conceive, expanding on his earlier thoughts on the subject. 'My comment about a woman's body shutting the pregnancy down was directed to the impact of stress on fertilization,' he writes. 'This is something fertility doctors debate and discuss. Doubt me? Google 'stress and infertility,' and you will find a library of research on the subject.' 'The research is not conclusive, but there is considerable evidence that stress makes conception more difficult,' he adds. 'And what could be more stressful than a rape?' Akin also says he only agreed to film a campaign ad in which he apologized for those comments because he was under pressure from his political advisers and campaign staff. He now regrets that apology and says he should have listened to his wife Lulli, the only person who objected. 'By asking the public at large for forgiveness, I was validating the willful misrepresentation of what I had said,' he writes in a chapter entitled Damage Control.","Former Missouri Republican congressman Todd Akin caused a national outrage with his controversial comments in 2012 .

"Kamara James, 29, who battled schizophrenia for years, was found dead in her California apartment . An Olympic fencer who battled schizophrenia for years has been found dead in her California apartment. Kamara James, 29, from Queens, New York, represented the United States at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. She was found September 20 at an apartment in Modesto where she lived alone. A spokesperson for the coroner said her death is still under investigation -  it does not appear suspicious, and suicide is not believed to be the cause. James battled the mental health condition since her senior year at Princeton, but was thought to be doing well recently. James, who was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and raised by her mother in Queens, began fencing aged nine after being introduced by a charity. 'It was difficult,' she once told the New York Daily News. 'But fencing helped me break out of my shell. I was always over-thinking things. Then I found a way to challenge myself physically and mentally.' By her teenage years she was a world junior bronze medalist, earning herself a scholarship spot at a prestigious New York City private school and later to Princeton. Even though she did not have the financial backing, according to USA Fencing, James developed a business plan. An internship at Morgan Stanley led to a $50,000 grant from the firm to support her Olympic expenses where she competed aged 19 and got a bronze medal. But behind the scenes her family was fractured - she refused to name her father who lived in Jamaica, although she got on well with her stepfather who died of a brain tumor in 1996, saying it was a 'different experience to have a male figure in my home life.' Her relationship with her mother was poor - they were estranged before she died - and James told the New York Daily News in 2004: 'She's not a big part of my life.' USA's Kamara James, right, and Russia's Tatiana Logounova during their preliminary bout in  the Women's Individual Epee competition at the 2004 Olympic Games at the Helliniko Fencing Hall in Athens . 'Of course, I'd love to have a good relationship with my parents, but it's not detrimental to me or my goals. Eric Rosenberg told Fencing.net: 'At the beginning of her senior year at Princeton, Kamara had herself admitted to a psychiatric hospital and received a diagnosis of schizophrenia. 'After only three months of treatment, she was released and returned to school. 'In a single semester, she managed to complete one year's worth of credits in addition to a 120 page senior thesis and graduate on time. 'Subsequently, Harvard University admitted her to a Master's program in comparative religion. James (seen here left and right) was found September 20 at an apartment in Modesto where she lived alone . James, (pictured) who was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and raised by her mother in Queens, began fencing aged nine after being introduced by a charity . On her graduation she opened a fencing club in Greenwich, Connecticut, but then had a second breakdown which was 'a slow, long ride,' according to Rosenberg. After her graduation James went in and out of treatment and was occasionally homeless. 'She was beaten up. She lacked a lot of the energy she had,' Rosenberg told PEOPLE magazine. 'She was emaciated, unkempt, wearing filthy clothes.' 'Kamara was a survivor; of abuse, of neglect, of poverty and of homelessness. I will not recount the sordid details of all that she endured,' he said on fencing.net. 'All her life, she refused to be defined by her suffering, but rather by her successes. 'Unfortunately, mental illness proved Kamara's most unrelenting adversary. 'Still, just prior to her death, she had resumed a stable drug regimen, was living comfortably and had begun thinking about the future.' USA Fencing president Don Anthony issued a statement on her death. 'Kamara James was one of the brightest, precocious, self-assured young people I have ever met,' Mr. Anthony's statement read. 'From her time as a very young fencer at the Peter Westbrook Foundation to her years at Princeton as an accomplished Olympian she remained warm, caring and confident. Kamara's untimely passing leaves our fencing community very saddened and her spirit, charm and wit will dearly be missed.' Keeth Smart, a 2009 Olympic silver medalist who trained alongside her for more than ten years when they studied together at the Peter Westbrook Foundation said in statement James was 'one of the smartest people' he knew.

"For decades, airline pilots were the only people lucky enough to catch sight of an incredible natural phenomenon known as red sprites. These rare burst of light last for just a few milliseconds and take place more than 50 miles (80 km) above the ground during a thunderstorm. Now one photographer has managed to capture this elusive light after spending months on the road following storms in Vivaro, Italy. For decades, airline pilots were the only people lucky enough to catch sight of an incredible natural phenomenon known as red sprites. Now one photographer has managed to capture this elusive light after spending months on the road following storms in Vivaro, Italy . The incredible flashes of light are caused by huge electrical discharges of lightning in the sky, and they get their deep red hue from nitrogen molecules in the air. Marko Korosec, 32, managed to capture the rare pictures whilst standing in a corn field, over 200 miles (320km) away from the phenomenon. Mr Korosec, from Sezana in Slovenia, said: 'I've been trying to capture them for few months now. 'I was very happy with the results, the details of the sprites came out pretty impressively.

The incredible flashes of light are caused by huge electrical discharges of lightning in the sky, and they get their deep red hue from nitrogen molecules in the air. Pictured is the lightning storm where the sprites were seen . Red sprites are electrical bursts of light that occur above highly active thunderstorms. They can be seen in the D region of the ionosphere. This is the area of the atmosphere just above the dense lower atmosphere, about 37 to 56 miles (60 km to 90 km) above the Earth. Atmospheric sprites have been known for nearly a century, but their origins were a mystery. They only last a few milliseconds and are relatively dim compared with other lightning. The late experimental physicist John Winckler accidentally discovered sprites, while helping to test a new low-light video camera in 1989. 'Sprites are not easy to capture, and might occur just a few times in hours, but this storm system was very active this time. 'It was very difficult to get these shots as they are so rare and you simply have to be quite lucky that the storm will produce them. 'You might take hundreds of photos without capturing any of them,' added Mr Korosec, who works as a system administrator for highways in Slovenia. 'Only the strongest and the most bright ones were visible to the naked eyes, acting like very short flash of light above the storm. 'I was standing on the open corn fields, I found the spot to have good visuals away from city lights and trees.' Atmospheric sprites have been known for nearly a century, but researchers have been baffled as to how, and why, they form. In May, Penn State University researchers managed to model the elusive phenomenon, which forms above thunderstorms and appears as a 'jellyfish' shape in the sky. They say they believe that sprites form at plasma irregularities and may be useful in remote sensing of the lower ionosphere – an area that facilitates radio communication on Earth.

She said: 'I thought it would be different when I got to college but it was the same.' Eventually she was forced to drop out, but hopes to return now that she has finally learned to love the way she looks. Kirstie explained that she has tried all sorts of diets to lose weight but that nothing has worked: . 'I did it more because people were telling me to lose weight and there was lots of pressure to look a certain way. Obviously for health reasons if I needed to lose weight I would, because health is the most important thing, but then I just think if you love the way you are and you're comfortable what's the problem?' Presenter Kate Upton - who has spoken about her battle with anorexia in the past - questioned the morality of a beauty pageant for obese women. She said: 'Obesity is the biggest drain of all eating disorders on the National Health Service. If there were to be a competition for Britain's Best Smoker or Britain's Skinniest Woman there would be an outcry.'

"Scroll down for video . Sarah Palin shot down the latest rumors that she and husband Todd are splitting on Friday, telling a conservative audience that she 'rarely' wears a ring. Gossip columns were buzzing earlier this month about the status of the Palins' marriage after photos of the conservative commentator, sans her wedding band - and make-up, emerged online. Palin said today that the sweaty photos were taken just after she had finished 'a workout' and denied that she and Todd were on the verge of divorce. 'Well, I rarely wear a ring, especially up in Alaska, you know it's choppin' wood or you're butcherin' a moose or something,' she told attendees of the Values Voter Summit held annually in Washington, D.C. Together Forever: Sarah Palin denied rumors that she and her husband Todd were divorcing today. Palin, seen here pointing to her wedding ring, chalked up the erroneous claims to the liberal media . Rumors began swirling that Palin and her husband Todd were on the outs after she was spotted last week without her wedding band on . Palin told attends of the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C. today that she 'rarely' wears a ring, and it has nothing to do with the status of her marriage . Palin playfully confronted the issue on her own accord Friday afternoon, saying midway through her speech, 'I heard the other day that I'm in the middle of another divorce. 'Or again, the same divorce, I guess, I dunno,' she continued. Oh, I read it - it must be true!' True to form, Palin chalked the false accusations up to the liberal media concocting lies about her family. 'And by the way, what the heck business is it of the liberal haters anyway?' she said afterward. 'Why are liberals so intolerant? she asked to roars of applause from the Christian conservative audience. Acknowledging Todd's absence from the event she said 'he sends his very best.' 'He's not able to be here because it is moose season,' she snarked. The former Alaska Governor said she was helping her husband, who's she's been with since high school, winterize his plane when she brought up the defamatory stories to him. Palin said Todd simply asked her, ' ""Yeah, uh, is it was the same thing they wrote last time? Is it still that $20 million divorce? "" ''Well, write me the check!' "" he said, teasing her. The 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee appeared to let the whole incident roll off her back, saying, 'We are used to it.' 'It's kind of tragic to say it,' she said, but 'at this point, what difference does it make?' This photo of the former Republican vice presidential candidate running errands in Anchorage, Alaska, a week and a half ago, sans her wedding ring, is what led to reknewed rumors that she and her husband Todd were on the outs . Palin appeared to have just worked left the gym when she was photographed, wearing casual dress. She confirmed today that she had just finished a workout at the time of the incident . Palin didn't talk about the media coverage of the drunken brawl her family recently got into in Alaska during which her daughter Bristol allegedly punched a man in the face, her son Track broke four ribs and her husband Todd bloodied his nose. Instead, she used the divorce chatter as a bridge into a lengthier rant on the mainsteam media and the perceived bias against conservatives. 'It is what happens to you, too, the lies that they tell about you,' she said, 'calling you the intolerant [one], the hater, the bigots' and the racists. 'I am speaking to the most slandered group in American today,' she said. The conservative firebrand speaker said liberals can't defeat conservatives' arguments so they just 'change the subject.' News reports about Palin's alleged divorces have been circulating since she burst onto the national political stage in the fall of 2008. Palin explained at a rally in Tampa, Florida, in October of that year that she sometimes doesn't wear a ring to events because of all the hand-shaking she has to do. 'And my wedding ring, it's in Todd's pocket 'cause it hurts sometimes when I shake hands and it gets squished,' she said. 'A $35 wedding ring from Hawaii that I bought by myself and 'cause I always thought with my ring it's not what it's made of, it's what it represents. 'And 20 years later, I'm happy to wear it,' she told the audience. When stories appeared online in August of 2009 about yet another suspected split between Palin and her husband, she rebuffed the claim to conservative blogger Robert Stacy McCain with this: 'Divorce Todd? Have you seen Todd? I may be just a renegade hockey mom, but I’m not blind!'","Gossip columns were buzzing earlier this month about the status of Palin's marriage after photos her, sans her wedding band, emerged online .

"David Cameron yesterday suggested he could campaign for a vote to leave the EU if he fails to win major changes to Britain’s membership. Seeking to contain a spiralling crisis after the defection of a second Tory MP to Ukip, the Prime Minister said reforms to immigration rules would be at the heart of his plan to negotiate looser ties with Brussels. Mr Cameron said he was confident that other countries would agree concessions for the UK ahead of an in/out referendum, including an opt-out from the EU’s founding aim of ‘ever closer union’. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron suggested he could campaign for a vote to leave the EU if he fails to win major changes to Britain’s membership. It came during an appearance on BBC’s Andrew Marr programme (above) He said reforms to immigration rules would be at the heart of his plan to negotiate looser ties with Brussels . But he also gave the clearest signal yet he might recommend an EU exit if his renegotiation fails – a key demand of his Eurosceptic MPs. ‘If I thought that it wasn’t in Britain’s interests to be in the European Union I wouldn’t argue for us to be in it,’ Mr Cameron told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme. ‘I am just a deeply patriotic politician and person. I do this job because I love my country, I care passionately about its future and I want it to be a strong, proud, self-governing independent nation.’ Reacting to Mark Reckless’s defection he said it was ‘counterproductive and senseless’. He said the only choice facing voters at the next election was between a Conservative and Labour government. He added that he would ensure rules on freedom of movement were reformed – suggesting that EU citizens working in Britain should be barred from sending child benefit back home, for instance – and that the right to work should also be restricted to countries whose economies have reached a certain level. ‘If you want to have a European referendum, if you want to have immigration controlled... there is only one option and that is to have a Conservative government after the next election,’ Mr Cameron said. Mr Cameron (pictured) said he was confident that other countries would agree concessions for the UK ahead of an in/out referendum, including an opt-out from the European Union’s founding aim of ‘ever closer union’ Ed Miliband is set to win a ‘comfortable working majority’ in 2015, pollster Lord Ashcroft said last night. The former Tory chairman said Labour could secure up to 37 per cent of the vote from core supporters and Lib Dem defectors. Ukip is likely to win Tory seats Thurrock and Thanet South, he added. A poll of 8,000 people found that more than one in four Tory voters in 2010 would now vote for another party. More than half would support Ukip. Lord Ashcroft said his polls put the Tories behind in 24 marginal seats – leaving them with fewer seats than Labour. Ed Miliband is set to win a ‘comfortable working majority’ in 2015, pollster Lord Ashcroft said last night . Aides insisted the Prime Minister had not shifted stance on a referendum – but Eurosceptic MPs were convinced he had hardened his line. And in a sign of the growing pressure on Mr Cameron over Europe, last night former defence secretary Liam Fox warned the Conservatives will lose the election unless they toughen up on immigration. ‘We had better have a workable narrative on immigration in the next six months or we are going to find it very difficult to win the next election,’ he told a fringe event. Senior Tories are also telling the Prime Minister it is vital that the party halts the Ukip tide by defeating Mr Reckless in a by-election that is likely to be delayed until November. Her chic dresses have stolen the show at past conferences – but it seems this year Samantha Cameron is going for a more casual look. The Prime Minister’s wife, pictured, arrived in Birmingham yesterday wearing dark corduroy trousers, a pinstriped blue shirt and navy heels. It seemed an unlikely choice for the style-conscious 43-year-old, but the outfit is expected to spark a buying frenzy in what has been called the ‘SamCam effect’. Fashion pundits have already hailed the come-back of corduroy – which had its heyday in the 1970s – with other celebrity fans including Madonna and model Cara Delevingne.

"A couple were jailed yesterday for a brutal attack on the daughter they felt had shamed them by dating a black man. David and Frances Champion repeatedly punched Jane in the face and shouted racist abuse while kicking her boyfriend out of the family home. They lost control after they returned home to find their 17-year-old daughter in a ‘state of undress’ with Alfonce Ncube, a court heard. Assaulted by her parents: Jane Champion was hit and punched in the face by her father and mother for having a relationship with a black man . Racial abuse: Boyfriend Aflonce Ncube was subjected to racial abuse and physical assault from Jane's parents because of his race . After throwing the waiter out of the . house, Mr Champion, 50, grabbed his daughter by her hair and started to . hit her, said Nicola Powell, prosecuting. ‘He told her she was destroying the . family and pushed her out of the door, Champion shouting racist language . to describe Mr Ncube,’ she added. Jane went to stay with her grandmother . but returned to her parents in St Thomas, Swansea, once the situation . had apparently calmed down. But a month later her parents challenged her over Mr Ncube when they returned from a pub. ‘David Champion asked his daughter if . she was still seeing Mr Ncube. When she told him she was, he punched her . in the face,’ said Miss Powell. ‘Miss Champion said she felt huge pain . to her left eye but her father then grabbed her by the throat and . continued hitting her.’ Mrs Champion, 47, then began hitting . her daughter – causing swelling on her face and lumps on her head – . yelling abuse at the teenager saying: ‘You deserve it. It is all your . fault.’ Swansea Crown Court was told Mrs Champion said her daughter had . ‘brought shame on her family’. The couple then went in search of Mr Ncube at the Swansea restaurant where he worked. When they were removed from the . premises Mrs Champion continued to bang on the restaurant window. John . Hipkin, defending her husband, said his client knew that it was an . ‘abhorrent’ assault, adding: ‘It’s not excusable in any way, shape or . form. ‘But the circumstances in which he found his young daughter meant he reacted in a terrible way. Lessons have been learned.’ Georgina Buckley, defending Mrs . Champion, said: ‘She accepts her actions were fuelled by alcohol and . that she confronted her daughter in a wholly unacceptable and disgusting . way. ‘She is remorseful and her daughter has sent her a text message before the court hearing wishing her well.’ Jailed for the 'vile' attack: Father David Champion (right) was sentenced to 12 months in jail and mother Frances (left) to nine months after punching and hitting their 17-year-old daughter and kicking her boyfriend . Judge Peter Heywood told the couple: ‘Your behaviour was disgraceful and you used vile language. ‘We live in a liberal and enlightened . society and these sorts of racist behaviour cannot be tolerated. The way . you reacted was totally inappropriate. ‘I would be failing in my public duty if I was to do anything other than impose a custodial sentence.’ Mr Champion was sentenced to 12 months in prison and his wife to nine months. Both admitted assaulting their daughter. Mr Champion also pleaded guilty to a racially aggravated assault against Mr Ncube and his wife admitted a racial abuse charge. 'You deserve it': Jane was punched in the face by her father after admitting she was still dating Mr Ncube. Her mother also hit her, saying 'you deserve it. It is all your fault.' The couple have another daughter, who is 12. The court heard that Mr Ncube suffered a dead leg in the first attack after being kicked by Mr Champion. Jane, who is studying sports science . at college, suffered bleeding from her ear in the second attack at the . hands of her mother. She met Mr Ncube at the college and the pair have . been dating for two years. He moved from his native Zimbabwe to Southend . in Essex when he was eight. Miss Champion said her parents had apologised for their actions and she had forgiven them. She told the Mail: ‘I have seen my . parents a few times since they were arrested and they are very sorry for . what they did. I don’t know why they did it. Alfie and I love each . other very much.’ Her parents originally pleaded not guilty to charges in two earlier appearances but later changed their plea to avoid a trial. Speaking outside the family’s terraced . house on a quiet street in Swansea, a relative said they wanted to . reunite Jane with her parents. The family spokesman said: ‘We’re . trying to get the family back together again. We are working on getting . Jane and her parents back speaking. ‘It’s been a terrible case for everyone involved. Now we just want to put it all behind us.’.","David and Frances Champion have been jailed for assaulting their daughter, 17, and her boyfriend Aflonce Ncube in a racist attack .

"Condemned: This government alcohol awareness poster has sparked outrage after 'shifting the blame' onto rape victims if they have been drinking . A government poster has sparked outrage after 'shifting the blame' onto rape victims if they have been drinking. The black-and-white alcohol awareness poster features the image of a rape victim . crying on the ground, with the slogan: 'One in three reported rapes . happens when the victim has been drinking.' It ran as part of the NHS and Home Office's 'Know Your Limits' campaign in 2006, but can still be seen in NHS hospitals, GP surgeries and universities. Now, an online petition has been launched to ban the poster and has so far gained  more than 15,000 signatures in just a few days. One of the signatories, Dr Alexis Thomas, from London, said the poster gave the 'wrong message' to people across the UK. 'Yes, . it is good to try to reduce the amount people drink, but the poster . implies that, had the victims of one in three reported rapes not been . drunk, those rapes would not have happened,' she said. 'This . is a false argument and one that shifts the blame for the rape to the . victim, similarly to previous suggestions that women who dress . provocatively are ""asking"" to be raped.' The Change.org petition, started by Jack May from Oxford, is titled: 'NHS & Home Office: Remove all copies of this poster and stop victim blaming'. Addressed to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Theresa May, it states: 'This is a blatant and appalling case of victim-blaming, putting the onus on the victim rather than the perpetrator. 'Two honourable intentions -- to stop people drinking, and to stop rape happening - are being completely deformed. 'It is not consistent with the NHS' own . guidelines on ""Help after rape and sexual assault"" in which they say ""If . you have been sexually assaulted, remember that it wasn’t your fault. It doesn’t matter what you were wearing, where you were or whether you . had been drinking. A sexual assault is always the fault of the . perpetrator. Outrage: An online petition has been launched to ban the poster, which was recently spotted on the wall of an NHS premises. Above, a Twitter user named Tracy said she was 'disgusted' by the government poster's slogan . Targeted: The petition is aimed at Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) and Home Secretary Theresa May (right) 'We ask the NHS and the Home Office to destroy this poster in all formats.' Launched in 2006, the 'Know Your Limits' campaign aimed to raise public awareness of the risks associated with binge drinking among 18 to 24 year olds. Its controversial 'rape' poster remains available to download online and has been spotted on the walls of numerous public places. The poster has also been widely condemned on social-networking sites - with . many users deeming it 'disgusting' and 'inappropriate'. Shocked: The poster has also been widely condemned on social-networking sites, with many users deeming it 'inappropriate'. Above, Sophie Wood said: 'I didn't realise rape was a potential side effect of women drinking' Questioning the government's approach: Ross Williams wrote: 'Is it really appropriate for the Home Office to use ""rape"" and blame victims to show the effects of alcohol?' One woman took to Twitter after spotting the poster at work, writing: 'NHS victim blaming, seen at occupational health today. Disgusted.' Meanwhile, Sophie Wood tweeted: 'I didn't realise rape was a potential side effect of drinking.' A . Home Office spokesman said the 'Know Your Limits' campaign ran from . 2005 to 2007 and focused on alcohol statistics, not violence against . women and girls. He added that the government no longer uses this campaign, nor stocks any copies of the poster. Sharon Gosling said: 'Seriously disgusted by this NHS England poster.

"A routine traffic stop by a police officer landed a sheriff's office a surprise seizure of nearly $500,000 in drug money during a search. The deputy pulled over the vehicle in Houston, Texas, off the I-10 East after noting the driver acting nervously when the officer approached the vehicle, Harris County Sheriff's Office said. The driver told the deputy he was a construction worker who was just getting off work, but the officer noted the driver's clothes were too clean to have been worn in a building site, sheriff's officials said. A routine traffic stop by a deputy in Houston, Texas, landed the county sheriff's office a surprise seizure of nearly $500,000 in drug money and packages of narcotics (pictured) linked to a notorious Mexican cartel . A search of the car, which was seized on Wednesday last week, found $448,000 in cash and several bags in the front seat. Both the money, bags and the vehicle were seized. The driver said the Gulf Coast Cartel, a notorious Mexican drug trafficker syndicate, paid him to deliver the money, according to sheriff's officials. The driver and the car were transported to the sheriff's office in Wallisville where a dog unit sniffed out the drugs in packages inside the vehicle. The driver was not arrested pending an investigation. The seizure is the second in recent weeks for the Harris County Sheriff's Office which last week discovered $12,000 in another vehicle search. Mexico is struggling under the grip of deadly drug cartels - but the authorities are fighting back and in recent months have scored a number of hi-profile arrests of infamous cartel heads. Last month, the security forces captured the leader of the once-feared Juarez Cartel in the country's restive north, the second drug kingpin which fell in just a number of days. Vicente Carrillo, 51, long-time head of the Juarez Cartel, was a fierce rival of Joaquin 'Shorty' Guzman, the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. The car was stopped off the I-10 and was seized and searched after the deputy noted the driver was 'nervous' Carrillo's rival was the world's most wanted drug boss until his capture in February. A two-year turf war between the two gangs unleashed a bloodbath in Ciudad Juarez, in Chihuahua state on Mexico's border with Texas, making it one of the most violent places in the world. Politicians and members of the security forces have long been linked to the deadly cartels. Last month, a Mexican mayor and his wife were accused of being involved in the disappearance of 43 students who were believed to have been abducted by a 'narco' syndicate. Jose Luis Abarca, who is mayor of Iguala and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa were both accused of having strong links with the Guerreros Unidos cartel. Mr Arbarca ordered the arrest of the 43 students who were protesting against the drugs gang in September, and who were then handed over to the cartel. The cartel is understood to have paid Arbarca a monthly retainer of up to $220,000 and effectively ran the city of Iguala in the Guerrero state. More than 60,000 have been killed in Mexico's drug wars between 2006 to 2012, according to Human Rights Watch.","Driver told Texas officer he had just gotten off work from construction job .

"Three quarters of sunbeds have failed safety tests in undercover checks by officials. Salons are using beds three times as hot as the Australian outback – putting unsuspecting clients at risk of serious skin conditions such as cancer. In the worst cases, sunbeds breached the legal limit by as much as three times, emitting UV rays too hot to ever occur on earth. Many salons are using sunbeds three times as hot as the Australian Outback - putting users at risk of skin cancer - an investigation by Trading Standards has revealed . Tanning salons, hairdressers and nail bars with sunbeds caused the most concern, while sunbeds in gyms were found to have much higher levels of compliance. Now, even the tanning industry has joined calls for tougher action against rogue operators. The latest shock figures come from North Yorkshire County Council's Trading Standards department - but there are fears the problem could be nationwide. The report revealed that 75 per cent of sunbeds failed to meet the legal limit for an acceptable level of UV radiation. Undercover officers found sunbeds emitting radiation at between 1.5 and 2.5 times the legal limit - a level hotter than the sun in the Australian Outback. The investigation began after complaints from customers that the tanning beds were too hot. It involved Trading Standards officers donning protective radiation suits to check UV levels. Tests carried out earlier this year in West Yorkshire found 89 per cent of beds failed to meet the legal safety limit. Lamps in sunbeds can use a level of UV no more powerful than the legal limit of 0.3 watts per square metre, which is the equivalent of the sun on a hot day in Spain. However, investigations in Wakefield, Bradford, Kirklees, Leeds, and Calderdale revealed some sunbeds were belting out 0.9 watts per square metre, a level of solar energy too hot ever to be found on earth. Some beds were pumping out 0.9 watts per square metre, three times the legal limit and a level of UV radiation too hot ever to be found on earth . Similarly, an inspection of all the sunbeds in North Tyneside carried out in March  found that eight out of 10 sunbed salons failed to comply with the rules. The average level of radiation they found was 0.49 watts per square metre, with at least one bed emitting 1.18 watts. Officials underlined that while 0.3 watts can be compared with a hot day on the beach in the Mediterranean, 0.9 watts is completely off the scale. The Trading Standards investigation began after complaints from customers that the tanning beds were too hot . Clare Forbes, of West Yorkshire County Council's Trading Standards department said: 'Such levels of UV radiation do not occur anywhere on the earth's surface. Not even 0.6 occurs anywhere on earth.' A Trading Standards officer for North Yorkshire County council said the beds that failed the tests were all suspended from use until the bulbs were repaired or replaced. Officers will now expand the survey to cover the whole county. They added: 'As we move into autumn officers warned people who may be tempted to use sunbeds to maintain their holiday tan, that they may be risking serious skin damage and worse.' Gary Lipman, Chairman of The Sunbed Association, joined in calls for further regulation to keep the public safe. He said: 'We welcome North Yorkshire County Council's efforts to ensure sunbed businesses are operating within the law. 'Our Code of Practice requires our members to operate to best practise but beyond our membership we are aware that not all tanning businesses operate to such high standards. 'We very much hope that now these tests have been taken, the Council uses its powers to ensure compliance, so that all sunbed businesses are operating on a level playing field. 'Only the local authority has the powers to ensure compliance and where this is properly enforced across the board, experience dictates that the vast majority of salons comply. 'We would encourage the Council to take swift action against any salon that resists compliance. 'We would always recommend that anyone looking to use a sunbed, seeks out a member of The Sunbed Association, where they are assured of receiving correct advice and information from properly trained staff about responsible tanning.'","Three quarters of sunbeds failed safety tests in spot checks by officials .

"Accident victim Emma Stephens . WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . One lazy Sunday morning back in July, Emma Stephens slipped while climbing out of the bath - landing teeth-first on the bath rim. 'I didn't have time to put a hand in front of my face,' she recalls. The fall smashed one of Emma's bottom teeth into pieces, while a top tooth came out completely. Three teeth next to it ended up embedded high in her gums. Emma, 44, her partner Karl and her two children, aged 11 and seven, were staying at her mother's house in Hertfordshire. Hearing the crash, Karl raced upstairs and hauled her out of the bath. 'It wasn't until I saw his face that I realised it was serious. My mouth was full of blood - I couldn't string a sentence together,' recalls Emma, who works for a telecommunications group. 'I was in such a state of shock that I didn't really feel the pain. But it was still terrifying.' Things would only get worse - the ambulance took 40 minutes to arrive, and was turned away from the local A&E. 'The doctors said we needed to go a hospital with a specialist clinic,' she says. Although there are no official figures on how many people damage their teeth in accidents or assaults in the UK, it's estimated that hundreds of thousands of people each year have their teeth chipped, broken or pushed out of place. A recent audit based on 1,384 patients has revealed there is woeful confusion nationwide over what to do when someone loses a tooth - with nothing like the strict protocols that exist for treating other medical emergencies, such as broken bones. This lack of clarity - as well as little specialist training for dentists - is leaving patients in pain and with disfiguring injuries, says Serpil Djemal, a consultant in restorative dentistry, who established the UK's only adult- dedicated dental trauma unit, at King's College Hospital, London. According to the new evidence, which was collected by Miss Djemal, half of patients who experience some sort of dental trauma remain in severe pain and suffer disabling stress and embarrassment for weeks afterwards. Scroll down for video . Yet there are very simple measures we could all take that could dramatically reduce the impact of someone losing a tooth. The first of these, says Miss Djemal, is never to discard a tooth that's been knocked out. 'Pick it up - avoiding the root - get rid of any obvious dirt by licking it or running it under water, then put it back in the mouth as close as possible to where it belongs,' she advises. 'Minutes count here. When a tooth is knocked out, the nerves and blood vessels are severed; the blood supply to the live tooth is cut. But delicate cells on the surface of the root of the tooth are capable of re-attaching themselves to the jawbone - as long as they're not damaged.' Emma  fell on her mouth getting out of bath, sustaining severe dental trauma - but was turned away at A&E . If putting the tooth back within minutes of the accident is out of the question, putting it in milk will maintain the correct fluid balance in the root, and will help the cells to survive for longer - possibly up to six hours. 'A knocked-out permanent tooth is one of the few real emergency situations in dentistry,' says Dr Peter Day, consultant in paediatric dentistry at Leeds University. 'The public needs to be made aware of how to proceed immediately following these unexpected injuries.' Next week, Miss Djemal will launch a charity called Dental Trauma UK, which aims to ensure everyone knows what to do if they lose a tooth. Its slogan is: 'Pick it, Lick it and Stick it.' 'Putting a tooth back in the gum could save the tooth,' she says. 'If bystanders, paramedics and doctors at A&E all know how important this is, it could mean that far more teeth are saved.' The charity will also begin a major educational programme for dentists - with extra training, online material and an accreditation programme, so people can check that their local dentist has the expertise to treat dental trauma. 'The urgent care patients need can only be provided by local dentists,' says Miss Djemal. 'While all undergraduate dentists learn about reimplantation and managing dental trauma, they'll get no more than a single lecture on the subject. The vast majority will never see a case involving a knocked-out tooth during their training.' Indeed, research led by Dr Day has shown that out of 200 children treated at five dental clinics after a tooth had been knocked out, only 25 were re-implanted. 'Children are advised not to have implants until their jaw is fully formed, which normally happens by age 18. Without a tooth or implant in place, the bone in the jaw begins to deteriorate - with a permanent impact on their dental health,' he adds. Emma was lucky. Her partner Karl knew from his rugby-playing days that a knocked-out tooth was worth saving. Emma says: 'I saw it in the bath and was going to throw it away. But Karl took it downstairs and put it in a glass of milk, which he brought along to the hospital. 'I was still too shocked to ask what on earth he was doing.' After being turned away by A&E, Karl drove Emma to the maxillofacial clinic at Northwick Park Hospital, 20 miles away, where doctors put the tooth back in her mouth - fixing it in place with a splint. 'I never for a moment thought the tooth would re-root. But it did. If Karl had not been so quick-thinking, I'd have had to live with a missing tooth or spend £2,000 on an implant.' She was treated at Kings College Dental Hospital where the adult dental trauma unit is best in country . The expense of dental work isn't the only consideration. 'Once a real tooth takes root, it has the same chance of surviving for longer than an implant,' says Miss Djemal. She also advises patients to keep a decent photograph of their smile. 'A selfie will do perfectly,' she says. This is so knocked-out teeth can be reimplanted in the right position. 'An X-ray can provide this information - but only if the tooth is still straight and the damage is relatively minor,' she explains. Emma was referred to the dental trauma service at King's College Hospital 24 hours after her accident - and was surprised to be asked if she had a selfie. 'Karl had a picture of me on his phone, with my face full-on and with a big smile.' It provided all the information the dentists needed. That day, Emma had five hours of reconstructive surgery. The knocked-out tooth was repositioned, the teeth that had been pushed into the gums were pulled back in place and the smashed bottom tooth was replaced with a tooth-coloured filling built up over the original root. Since then, Emma has had regular root-canal work to repair some damaged nerves. However, not all patients receive treatment so quickly. When Carlota Berruezo, 33, fractured two top teeth and pushed a third into her lower gum after going over the handlebars of her bike this summer, it took nearly a fortnight to get the emergency treatment she needed. Carlota, a strategic consultant who lives in South-West London, was told by her local A&E that as her jaw was not broken, she should see an emergency dentist. But after five different consultations over 12 days, Carlota was still in agony - with one tooth stuck in her gum - and unable to close her mouth. Emma Stephens's mouth after her fall . 'I spent £1,000 on various investigations and X-rays, as well as having one piece of broken tooth taken out and the nerve underneath it removed,' she says. She was incorrectly told the only way to get the stuck tooth back in place was by wearing a fixed brace for a year - at a cost of £18,000. Finally, one dentist told her about the King's College clinic, where the stuck tooth was manoeuvred back into position at the first appointment. 'In the last four months, I've had the other teeth restored, and root-canal work to repair the nerves. I'm pretty well back to normal.' Emma's teeth have also been fully repaired. 'For several weeks, I was living on shakes and soft food because the teeth felt insecure, even though they were all held in place. I lost a stone.' Now, she feels lucky to have landed on her teeth. 'Anywhere else on my head and I might not have been here,' she says.' For the new charity, see dentaltrauma.co.uk.

"A former chief of staff for Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander, has been found dead after committing suicide while awaiting court proceedings on child pornography charges. Jesse Ryan Loskarn's lifeless body was found Thursday by family members in their Sykesville, Maryland, home, and officials told MailOnline the former Senate staffer killed himself by hanging. The accused pedophile, 35, had been released last month from jail to live with parents Chuck and Gay Loskarn. Police discovered child pornography on Loskarn's hard drive after raiding his home as part of an investigation of a Canadian film-maker. New allegations: Loskarn wrote that he was sexually abused as a child and that is what drew him to child porn . 'We loved our son very much, and we’re devastated by his death,' they said in a statement released to Politico. 'Please respect our privacy at this difficult time and let us grieve in peace. Pray for him, his family and friends.' Loskarn was on conditional release at the home provided he wear a GPS monitoring bracelet and have no access to the internet. 'At approximately 12 p.m. yesterday, Carroll County Sheriff’s Deputies responded to a private residence.. for a report of an unconscious male, believed to be deceased,' authorities said in a statement. 'Family members reported finding 35-year old Jesse Ryan Loskarn unresponsive in his basement where he’d been residing with family since [December 16].' Rising star: Loskarn had worked as the chief of staff to Republican Senator Lamar Alexander for two years (seen together in January) The death was ruled a suicide Friday by the State Medical Examiner's Office, it was first reported by Politico. 'The cause of death was hanging and it was by suicide,' medical examiner's office spokesperson Bruce Goldfarb confirmed to MailOnline. 'For everyone involved, this is a sad and tragic story from beginning to end,' Sen Alexander said in a Friday morning statement. Loskarn's lawyers had successfully argued for his conditional release by saying the . 35-year-old had no prior convictions or arrests and 'deep ties' to the community. Magistrate Judge John Facciola ordered Loskarn to be confined to his parents' despite objections from prosecutors . Those objections included statements he is alleged to have made while in custody that suggested he was a suicide risk, according to reports. His lawyer dismissed the notion, saying Loskarn taking his life was 'not a concern.' Loskarn's parents appeared in court for the hearing, . and his father stood with his arm around his mother as she told the . judge that they have no home computer and that cellphones and iPads were . password protected. They promised to ensure their son would have no access to the Internet. Loskarn was arrested last month and . faced up to 10 years on possession charges and a minimum of five and . maximum of 20 years on distribution charges. Filings cited by the Tennessean showed multiple delays in the prosecution of charges against the former Senate aide, possibly hinting at a plea deal being in the works. Loskarn had served as chief of staff for the Republican senator for two years up until his arrest. According to a filing with the U.S. District Court last week, police used a ram to enter Loskarn's home the . day it was searched, and noticed that he put something on the ledge outside a . window. It turned out to a portable hard drive with videos depicting child pornography, according to the filing. The filing states that, in 2010, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and Toronto Police Service were investigating a movie production company whose films feature young nude boys, and discovered the former political operative made several purchases from the company in 2010 and 2011. Beginning of the end: Ryan Loskarn was arrested on December 11 (pictured) and later ordered to live with his parents until his trial. He was found dead by suicide in their home on January 23 . Stunned and saddened: U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), pictured right, called Ryan Loskarn's (left) troubles 'a sad and tragic story from beginning to end' in a Friday statement . Federal investigators then identified Loskarn's residential IP . address on a peer-to-peer network offering files 'with names that are . consistent with child pornography broadcasting as a download candidate,' the filing continued. Loskarn . was a rising star who had spent the past decade working his way up to . increasingly important posts in the House and then the Senate. Republican Senator Alexander said in a news release the day of the arrest that he was 'stunned, . surprised and disappointed' by the allegations against his newly . departed staffer. Alexander . initially placed Loskarn on unpaid leave, but before the end of the . day, he had replaced Loskarn with David Cleary, the senator's . legislative director. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, another Tennessee Republican for whom Loskarn had . worked as communications director, said she was 'shocked, saddened and . stunned.'","The state medical examiner has confirmed to MailOnline that Jesse Ryan Loskarn, 35, killed himself by hanging .

Horror movie fan Jonathan Lockett, 17,  was so convincing in his make-up artist by sister Chantelle Delaney that two children called police . His sister had decked him out in fake blood and gruesome looking injuries for a photoshoot in Cheshire . But when she started taking pictures of her brother outside a social club, two children playing nearby thought Jonathan's make up was real and mistakenly called police thinking that he had been attacked . Two officers dashed to the scene to question the pair but let them go when they realised there been a misunderstanding. Chantelle, 23, from Warrington, Cheshire, who has recently completed a course in media and make-up at Warrington Collegiate, said: 'I couldn't believe it when the officers approached me and told me what had happened. 'They had received a report of a badly injured man in the area and assumed the worst. I was shocked at first but now I feel quite flattering to think the makeup looked so real. During the makeover Jonathan had fake blood spattered over a white shirt and was made up to look as if he had suffered horrific gashes across his face, with part of his cheek missing. The makeup started with latex, around half an hour of drying and wax to recreate gashes.

Chantelle then added fake blood and mud to finish before the pair went to Penketh Social Club to take photographs of her work. She said: 'My plan was to make Jonathan look as terrifying as possible and the whole make-up process took about an hour. 'I have to say I myself couldn't even bear to look at him when I had finished, it gave me the chills - I suppose that's the sign of a good make-up artist. 'I found the perfect setting for the shoot, across the road from my mum's house in a disused building. We got a couple of strange looks from people as we were walking over but I never thought that people would think that Jonathan's make-up was real. 'It's all boarded up at the back of the club so we went there and I just asked my brother to walk around to get some action shots. Then all of a sudden these two police officers started to walk towards us and I was worried I was going to get in trouble because it's private land. 'They then said a couple of kids had just seen my brother walking around like a zombie and presumed he had been injured in some kind of assault. The kids only looked about eight and they were too scared to look at him. The pair are pictured without make-up on. Chantelle said: 'I still have to finish my portfolio but I am now confident of my skills. I will just have to make sure my shoots are done indoors now and away from the public' 'I didn't know what to say, I was lost for words - by this point a crowd had gathered and I remembered two young boys crying as Jonathan looked so scary. Thankfully the police had a laugh and a joke about it too. 'I know this sounds bad but I was actually delighted to get the reaction I did - I just feel bad that I scared a couple of kids in the process. If I can make someone believe that my brother was a zombie then my work here is done.' Sgt Mark Naylor of Cheshire Police said: 'On our arrival, it was clear that there was indeed a male wearing torn clothing, who was covered in blood and appeared to have a severe facial injury and who was stood with a female.

Such a gaffe occurred at the at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) when Microsoft showing off its next-generation Xbox One hardware and games . During a demonstration of 'Killer Instinct' a male producer of the game was matched up against a woman, who appeared to be bad at playing video games. Scroll down to watch the video and hear the comment... Unfortunate remarks: A Microsoft presenter slipped an apparent rape reference into a Monday presentation at Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, the biggest video-game conference of the year . Are women even allowed? In the male-dominated world of computer games, the 'rape' joke does nothing to entice female game players to want to join in the fun . One blog described the woman as 'playing a video game like a girl' perpetuating the stereotype that women are not serious gamers. 'I can't even block correctly, and you're too fast,' she says. 'Here we go. Just let it happen. It'll be over soon,' her male partner says. The audience laughed at the remark, but many have interpreted it as a rape joke. The banter continued between the duo laden with sexual innuendo. 'You have a fight stick,' she says. 'Wow, you like those,' he retorts. 'No, I don't like this,"" she responds. Terrible instincts: The remark was made during a public demo of the game 'Killer Instinct' where the male presenter told his female opponent 'Just let it happen. It'll be over soon.' On Twitter, the audience reacted right away. 'Wow. This is really gross. Male overpowering a female in a game, so of course, rape joke. Good one, Msoft,' @Vahn16 tweeted. 'Oh . my god. One of the people just made a rape joke onstage and the . audience actually liked it. That's sick,' @IatosHaunted tweeted. 'Even . if it was unintentional, Microsoft should've realized they shouldn't . make a rape joke in an environment already toxic with misogyny,' @stillgray tweeted. 'Let's . bring a woman on stage and joke about how she's bad at games, and say . stuff like 'relax, just let it happen, it'll be over soon'??' @Jonathan_Blow tweeted. Boys only: Attendees play XBox One games at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles, California . A spokesperson for the company released a statement: 'The comments in question during the 'Killer Instinct' demo were not scripted. The demo was meant to include friendly gameplay banter, and there was no ill intent.' Microsoft has issued an apology for an inappropriate joke made during a demonstration of 'Killer Instinct' at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) on Monday. During a demonstration a male producer of the game was matched up against a woman, who appeared to be bad at playing video games. There was some awkward banter between the two gamers that was interpreted as a rape joke by the audience, when the man said: 'Just let it happen. It'll be over soon.' Microsoft apologized for the behavior of its employee and issued this statement from Microsoft Studios corporate vice president Phil Spencer. 'Yesterday, during the Xbox E3 briefing, one of our employees made an off the cuff and inappropriate comment while demoing 'Killer Instinct' with another employee. This comment was offensive and we apologize. At Microsoft, being open and respectful with others is central to our code of conduct and our values. Bullying and harassment of any kind is not condoned and is taken very seriously. We remain committed to make gaming fun for everyone, and in that effort, we must lead by example.' This is the second rape debacle in as many years at E3. Last year gamers were disturbed by a cuty-scene in video game Tomb Raider where players were required to save Lara Croft from being sexually assaulted. Though 47 per cent of gamers are female, according to a report by the Entertainment Software Association, sexism in the gaming industry has long been a problem.","Gamers are outraged over a rape joke made during an Xbox presentation .

"A tax cheat who compared himself as ‘Del Boy’ and applied to appear on The Only Way is Essex was jailed for five years today after conning the taxman out of £5.8million. Michael Woodward, 29, who applied to be on the ITV show in 2010, was cheating the government out of money, while using his ill-gotten gains to buy a fleet of luxury cars. Woodward passed thousands of pounds in profits off to co-defendant Richard Ponsford, 36, for non-existent 'consultancy services', before Ponsford handed the money back, minus his cut. Michael Woodward, 29 (left), who described himself as 'Del Boy' on his TOWIE application, and his 'best friend' Richard Ponsford, 36, were each jailed for five years after conning the Government out of millions in tax . This made his company profits look relatively small, meaning he was charged less corporation tax than he should have been by HMRC. Woodward used the profits to live a plush lifestyle, and when he was arrested in March 2011 he had a blue Bentley, a white Range Rover and a white Land Rover Discovery parked in his drive. He boasted of ‘loving designer clothes’ and lives in an Essex home worth more than £400,000. In his application to reality soap TOWIE Woodward named Ponsford as one of his closest friends. He also describes himself as a wheeler dealer ‘Del Boy’ character who loves designer gear. ‘If you don’t ask you don’t get so I have a lot of front (love to negotiate and save £££),’ he wrote. ‘Look after those closest to me. Generous and caring. Love my designer clothes.’ Woodward also owns an English Bulldog breeding company called Woody Couture. He submitted tax returns with supercars including a Maserati V8 and a Bentley listed as business expenses. Woodward, who supplied labour to Balfour Beatty and London Overground, pulled off the seven year corporation tax scam with the help of ‘best mate’ Ponsford. Giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court, Woodward insisted his ‘crooked’ father, who appointed him as director of the ‘Westview Rail’ firms when he was just 18, duped him into the fraud. But a jury convicted Woodward and Ponsford of cheating the public revenue, and Judge Michael Gledhill QC sentenced the pair to five years in jail each. Woodward’s firms include Westview Rail Limited Westview Rail LUL Limited, Westview Rail Protection Services Limited and Westview Resources Limited. The companies boasted a turnover of millions of pounds each year. They provided labourers to repair and renew tracks to large rail contractor companies including Balfour Beatty and London Overground Rail Operations Limited. Ponsford was the sole director of several companies but he had no employees, no company offices and the businesses were slammed as merely a ‘vehicle for fraud’. When Woodward was arrested in 2011 police discovered a fleet of luxury cars on his driveway, including a Bentley, a Maserati, and a Land Rover Discovery (pictured) They were Network 24 Finance Ltd, Network 24 (consultants) Ltd, Twentyfour/7 Consultants Ltd, Adventure Developments Ltd and Manor House Projects Ltd. Woodward attempted to explain away the lack of contracts between the companies as a ‘gentleman’s agreement’. Prosecutor Timothy Godfrey said: ‘The two defendants, Mr Woodward and Mr Ponsford, acting together over a period of some seven years pursued a fraudulent scheme - a fraud whereby they evaded £5.8million of tax. ‘In short what it concerned was the companies run by the first defendant Mr Woodward very significantly understating their profits and this meant of course that the companies as a result were taxed on an unduly favourable basis. ‘The profits of companies run by Mr Woodward being under-declared, falsely represented to the tax man and therefore the tax position was fraudulently advantageous to the defendants.’ Woodward evaded paying £4,373,105.84 of corporation tax and Ponsford earned at least £352,184 from the scheme. Woodward also evaded paying £1,469,005 of VAT in respect of refunds for cash he said he had paid to Ponsford's companies on bogus invoices. He used the excess cash as ‘untaxed money in the back pockets among members of his immediate family’ and company employees.","Michael Woodward, 29, called himself 'Del Boy' on TOWIE application form .

"A father was given a ticket for exceeding the speed limit by 9mph when he followed an ambulance rushing his sick daughter to hospital. Frantic Kevin Theaker dialled 999 when his daughter Sophie, 25, suffered a fit and stopped breathing in the shower at home. He jumped into his car and followed the ambulance but was clocked by a speed camera doing 39mph in a 30 zone and got a ticket with a £100 fine and three penalty points. But when he appealed to police - even sending in proof of his daughter's hospital admission - he was told the ticket couldn't be cancelled. Sophie Theaker and her father Kevin, who was fined for driving 9mph over the speed limit as he followed her ambulance to hospital when she had an epileptic fit . Mr Theaker's 2006 Toyota Celica, in which he was caught speeding during the rush to hospital . Unsympathetic officers at Northumbria Police told him he will have to take the case to court if he wants to challenge the fixed penalty notice. Mr Theaker, 56, said: 'The police always ask for the public's help, but what about when we need their help? 'She was in a really bad state, I thought I'd lost her. If I had been doing 90mph I would have held my hands up.' The trauma began on August 20 when Mr Theaker, a manufacturing team leader, heard a noise in the bathroom at the family's home in Sunderland. He dashed upstairs to find his daughter lying collapsed and lifeless in the shower and shouted for his wife Susan, 53, to call for help. An ambulance quickly arrived and his daughter's boyfriend Tony Thompson, 28, accompanied her in it while her brother Curtis, 21, followed in his van. Mr Theaker also followed the ambulance in his 2006 Celica GT Special Edition, which he bought new about eight years ago for £22,500. Mr Theaker said: 'The sound I heard her make in the shower, it took me over a week to get over it. It was like a horrible moan. Kevin Theaker and his wife Linda, pictured in June last year. The two thought their daughter was dying when she suddenly suffered an epileptic fit . Sophie Theaker was rushed to Sunderland Royal Hospital (pictured) after she collapsed . 'She stopped breathing for a couple of seconds. I went and grabbed her. She was in a very stiff position. It was like taking a doll out of the shower. 'I was screaming at my wife to get an ambulance. I thought that was it. Her heart rate was 130 when the paramedics arrived.' On the way to Sunderland Royal Hospital a fixed speed camera caught him speeding and two weeks later he got the fine from Northumbria Police. He wrote to their fixed penalty unit pleading for leniency given the circumstances - but they refused to relent. He said: 'I even sent Sophie's wristband to prove she had been in hospital and the parking ticket to show we were there from 10pm until 2am.' Ms Theaker, a steward, has now been diagnosed with epilepsy and has returned to work with tablets she will have to take for the rest of her life. Northumbria Police Temporary Chief Inspector John Heckels said: 'While we understand and sympathise with Mr Theaker's situation there is a specific process in place for motorists to challenge speeding enforcement. 'He now has the option of accepting the ticket, attending a speed awareness course or challenging the fixed penalty notice in the magistrates court, where he'll be able to put forward his specific circumstances for consideration.'","Kevin Theaker's daughter  rushed to hospital in ambulance after suffering fit .

"President Obama is being accused of sexism for publicly remarking on California Attorney General Kamala Harris's good looks at a fundraiser in San Francisco on Thursday, though he was forced to call her and apologize later that night after his remarks sparked a firestorm and he was accused of being sexist. The President said of the 48-year-old: 'She’s brilliant and she’s dedicated, . she’s tough...She also happens to be, by far, the best looking attorney . general,' Obama said, adding, 'It's true! C'mon!' According to a pool reporter who attended the event, Obama was . doting on Harris, 'noting a couple of times that she is, objectively, . easy on the eyes.' President Obama apologized for the distraction that his comments caused and his press secretary released a statement saying that the President 'regretted' the move. Commentators both liberal and conservative immediately took to Twitter to blast his remarks as 'unsettling,' 'disgraceful' and 'disrespectful.' Scroll down for video . Political pals: President Obama, seen here with Kamala Harris in February 2012, called her 'the best looking Attorney General' in the country at a fundraiser on Thursday . Beauty and brains: The daughter of an Asian Indian mother and Jamaican American father, Ms Harris has a unique look . 'Obama's comment about Kamala Harris is . disgraceful and really terrible for workplace equality,' wrote Jonathan . Chait of New York Magazine. Added Rebecca Traister, writer for . The New York Times Magazine and Salon, 'On What planet in [Obama's] mind did . he think that sounded like the right thing to say?' Obama's supporters argue that the . president and Harris, who is not married, are good friends and that it shouldn't be . considered a crime to compliment a women on her obvious good looks. 'The fact that this has in some way . become a story about his overall respect of women (or lack thereof) is a . slap in the face to the first lady, the first daughters, and every . other woman who appreciates a compliment that extends far beyond . appearance from the president or any other man,' Angela Rye, a . Democratic political consultant, told Politico. On Friday, press secretary Jay Carney made the first public reaction by the White House, saying: 'He apologized for the remark. He certainly regretted the distraction. He believes that she is a superb AG.' The President 'did not want in any way to diminish the attorney general's professional accomplishments and her capabilities. 'He fully recognizes the challenges women continue to face in the workplace and that they should not be judged based on appearance,' Mr Carney said. Michelle Obama has not commented on the controversy , but she did have a slip-up of her own on Thursday . in a TV interview where she accidentally called herself a 'single . mother.' During an interview with Burlington, Vermont CBS affiliant WCAX, the first lady was discussing healthy foods and how the demands of raising a family can leave little time for nutritious cooking. 'Believe me, as a busy single mother, Obama said, before quickly correcting herself, 'Or I shouldn't say single - as a busy mother.' Explaining her slip-up, she added, 'Sometimes, you know when you've got the husband who's president it can feel a little single. But he's there.' Single? Obama remarked on Harris' looks on the same day that Michelle Obama slipped up in an interview and called herself a 'single mother' Rising star: Many speculate that Ms Harris, the current Attorney General for California, could go on to run for governor of the state or even serve on the Supreme Court . Woman of firsts: She is the first female, African American and Asian American attorney general in the state, as well as the first Indian American attorney general in the country . Ms Harris is a Democratic favorite and a trailblazer in her home state. Her . mixed race descent - having been born of an Asian Indian mother who . emigrated to the U.S. from Chennai and a Jamaican American father- made . her the first female, African American and Asian American attorney . general in the state. On top of that, she is the first Indian American attorney general in the country. Her . career shows no sign of stopping, as she is regularly mentioned when . pundits speculate about possible Supreme Court nominees should a new . judge be appointed during President Obama's second term. Another possible track for her is the . gubernatorial one, as attorney general is a common springboard position . for those hoping to climb the local ladder. Little . is known about her current romantic situation, except that she was in a . serious relationship with the former mayor of San Francisco Willie . Brown. The two were a serious item and dated when he was the Speaker of the California State Assembly, but they reportedly broke up in 1998.

"The bodies of a lesbian couple have been found behind a dumpster after one was beaten to death and the other was fatally shot, authorities have said. Britney Cosby and Crystal Jackson, both 24, left their home in Houston, Texas on Wednesday night for a trip to Galveston - which is 50 miles south - in their new car. But their families did not hear from them and at 7.30am on Friday, a delivery man found their bodies near a dumpster outside a convenience store in Port Bolivar, just north of Galveston. Scroll down for video . Killed: Crystal Jackson, left in both pictures, and her girlfriend Britney Cosby, right, have been found murdered in Galveston, Texas after driving from their home in Houston for Mardi Gras last week . Detectives believe the women were killed elsewhere and then dumped at the store, KHOU reported. The Galveston County Medical Examiner's Office concluded that Cosby died from the result of blunt force trauma while Jackson was killed by a gunshot wound, KTRK reported. It is unclear whether the incident was an anti-gay hate crime but police are not ruling it out. Suspect: Detectives are looking for a man in his late 20s or early 30s seen in the couple's car . The couple had been together for two years and lived together. Jackson, a barista at Starbucks, was the mother of a five-year-old. Cosby worked as a security guard. 'That was her girlfriend, that was her soulmate,' one of Cosby's neighbor's, James Randle, told ABC. On Valentine's Day, Jackson wrote a Facebook message to Cosby beneath a photo of them together. 'Words can't explain . how u make me feel,' she wrote. 'From the moment we met, I just knew u was the one . for me, through all the tears, laughter, the good and bad, I still love u . always and forever.' Investigators are now searching for Cosby's vehicle, a silver 2006 Kia Sorrento with paper tags, and on Sunday, they released a composite sketch of the suspect who was reportedly seen driving the car. The suspect is described as a black male with an average build, standing between 5 feet 11 inches and 6 feet tall and in his late 20s or early 30s.

"Former National Basketball Association star Mookie Blaylock was sentenced on Monday to seven years in a Georgia prison followed by eight years of probation for killing a woman in a head-on traffic crash last year, court records show. Blaylock, known for his defensive prowess during a 13-year NBA career that ended in 2002, knew he should not have been driving due to a seizure disorder when his SUV crossed the center line and collided with a minivan outside Atlanta in May 2013, authorities have said. Sentenced: Mookie Blaylock was sentenced on Monday to seven years in a Georgia prison followed by eight years of probation for killing a woman in a head-on traffic crash last year . Star: Blaylock is seen here playing with the Atlanta Hawks, and also spent time with the New Jersey Nets and Golden State Warriors . Monica Murphy, a mother of five who was a passenger in the other vehicle, died of her injuries hours after the accident, authorities have said. Blaylock was in critical condition after the crash but recovered. Blaylock, 47, pleaded guilty on Monday to vehicular homicide and serious injury by vehicle, according to Clayton County court records. At the time of the crash, he faced an arrest warrant for failure to appear in court on drug possession and drunken-driving charges in a nearby county, according to police. Authorities never cited alcohol as playing a role in the fatal accident. Blaylock may only spend three years in prison if he attends alcohol abuse counseling and meets other criteria, lawyer Amanda Palmer told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Blaylock (seen here in 1990 playing for the New Jersey Nets) twice was on the NBA's All-Defensive First Team, and he was an NBA All-Star in 1994 . 'He has admitted he has a problem with alcohol and he is getting treatment for that,' Palmer told the newspaper, and also mentioned a DI arrest as well as 'several past DUI convictions.' However, she told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution he tested negative for alcohol in the 2013 incident. Palmer also said that in the courthouse '[Blaylock] said something to the effect that the accident had changed him, and I think he was referring to his drinking. Mr. Murphy [Frank Murphy, Monica Murphy's husband] spoke and said he understood it was a negotiated sentence... I can’t say he went so far to let say he was okay with it but I guess he let the court know he didn’t oppose it.' The former basketball player is reportedly a patient of Potter's House, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. As a basketball player, Blaylock's ability to shut down opposing players twice earned him a place on the NBA's All-Defensive First Team, and he was an NBA All-Star in 1994. He played with the Atlanta Hawks from 1992 to 1999 and also spent time with the New Jersey Nets and Golden State Warriors.","Mookie Blaylock was sentenced to seven years in  prison followed by eight years of probation for killing a woman in a May 2013 crash .

"Americans have rejected the chance of enjoying a cappuccino flavoured potato chip and instead chose the more exotic wasabi ginger option. Frito-Lay, who are owned by Pepsi, launched the Do Us A Flavor promotion where one million people got the chance to vote for a new type of chip. Customers got a chance to vote for their favourite option after the four new varieties, including Mango Salsa, Cheddar Bacon Mac and Cheese, entered shops in July. The company ran the competition over the summer trying to determine the most popular new flavoured chip . America has chosen a potato chip flavoured with Wasabi paste rather than one made from cappuccino . Last year Cheesy Garlic Bread won the competition and is still available in the shops. The inspiration behind the the winning option will receive either $1 million in prize money or a percentage of the flavour's annual sales - whichever is greater. Ram Krishnan, Frito-Lay's chief marketing officer, said this year's winner is evidence Americans want more ethnic flavors, even though the top four Lay's flavors remain Original, Barbecue, Cheddar & Sour Cream and Sour Cream & Onion. He said he couldn't have imagined Lay's selling a Wasabi Ginger flavor when he joined the company eight years ago. He said: 'We're kind of getting into a new flavour territory. When I went to school, Mexican food was exotic. Some comments on Lay's Facebook page described the cappuccino option as 'nasty' and 'gross'. The contest began in the United Kingdom, where Frito-Lay sells chips under the Walkers brand. Since then, it was launched in 14 countries before coming to the U.S. last year. Winning flavors in other countries include Pizza in Saudi Arabia, Shrimp in Egypt, Sunday Roast in New Zealand, Pickled Cucumber in Serbia and Aline's Caesar Salad in Australia. Given its success, Krishnan said the company is looking to launch the contest in other countries as well.","Frito-Lay asked the public to suggest new flavors for its chips .

"At least 13 Tunisian girls reportedly travelled to rebel-held Northern Syria to offer themselves as sex workers to opposition fighters. The report comes as concerns in Tunisia grow about religious orders or 'fatwas' that have circulated the internet calling on women to perform jihad through sex. Last week, a Tunisian minister of religious affairs appealed to girls not to be influenced by Islamic preachers outside of Tunisia who, it has been reported, made a number of 'sexual fatwas'. Syrian rebels are pictured after taking control of Raqqa. Reports from suggest 13 girls travelled to the rebel-held North to offer themselves as sex workers . Noureddine al-Khadimi rejected 'sexual jihad' fatwas, urging Tunisian people and state institutions to not respond to them. Tunisian newspapers reported that a young Tunisian man divorced his wife, and that they both headed to Syria almost a month ago to 'allow her to engage in sexual jihad with the mujahideen' there. This report followed earlier ones of a video widely circulated on the internet and social websites in Tunisia shows the parents of a veiled girl called Rahmah, 17. They said Rahmahat disappeared from home one morning and they 'later learned that she had headed to Syria to carry out sexual jihad.' The young girl has since returned to her family, who have kept her out of sight, and said that their daughter is not a religious fanatic 'but was influenced by her fellow students who are known for their affiliation with the jihadist Salafist.' Her parents said these fellow students may have brainwashed her and convinced her to travel to Syria 'to support the mujahideen there.' Such stories are becoming more common in Tunisia and parents are concerned about the influence charismatic Islamic leaders in other Arab countries can wield over their children. There are concerns in Tunisia about the influence of online videos calling for women to engage in a 'sexual jihad'. Pictured Syrian rebel checks an anti-aircraft weapon . Free Syrian Army fighters are pictured taking their positions Syrian army forces . The minister’s statements came after the . spread of an anonymous 'sexual jihad' fatwa on the Internet calling on . young women to support [opposition] fighters in Syria by providing . sexual services on the battlefield. According to media reports in Tunisia who quoted mujahideen returning to Tunisia after participating in jihad in Syria, 13 Tunisian girls headed to the battlefield in response to the 'sexual jihad' fatwa. News websites and social networks in Tunisia circulated a fatwa attributed to Sheikh Mohamed al-Arifi  in which he calls upon 'Muslim women' to perform jihad through sex. However, sources close to the sheikh denied that he had issued the fatwa, stressing that anyone who circulates or believes it is insane. Saudi Arabia is widely known to be financially backing the Syrian rebels fighting in Northern Syria and whose hardcore ‘Salafist’ strand of Islam influences a great number of the young fighters – many of whom are ‘jihadists’ and come from all around the world, including the UK. Reports in Tunisia stress though that the fatwa had gained much attention on pro-Syrian regime websites, the goal of which may be to tarnish the image of the Islamic fighters by stressing a key point of Syrian leader Bashar Al Assad that fundamentalists, supported by Salafist groups in Saudi Arabia, are amongst the Syrian rebels. A Syrian opposition fighter runs for cover from Syrian army snipers. Tunisian have appealed to girls to ignore then 'sexual jihad' internet calls . Al-Hadi Yahmad, a researcher on the affairs of Islamic groups, told Al-Hayat: 'The issue of sexual jihad was initially attributed to a Saudi sheikh who denied it, and this fatwa is abnormal and not endorsed by religious scholars.' He added that this fatwa — had it indeed been issued — may involve Syrian girls living in Syria, who can 'support the mujahideen by marrying them for a few hours.' Under Islamic law, a man can marry and consummate a marriage with his bride, before divorcing her the next day without any resistance from the bride or her family simply by following religious etiquette. Noor Eddin al-Khadimi, said that Tunisians should not abide by the fatwa. Her calls were duplicated by the Tunisian opposition also. Salma al-Raqiq, a Tunisian opposition figure, said that the 'jihad marriages' were a disgrace for the Tunisians. She also called on the authorities to start dealing with the increasing phenomenon of Tunisian jihadis heading to Syria to join radical Islamist groups. Al-Raqiq told the UPI press agency that the phenomenon was a dangerous one. She said that young girls, including minors, have been sent to Syria to 'marry' jihadis for a few hours.","Reports spread on internet calling for girls to offer themselves to fighters .

"The wife of an Army general facing sexual misconduct charges in North Carolina has written an opinion piece in support of her husband, claiming that the stresses of a decade of war contributed to recent high-profile military scandals. Rebecca Sinclair's husband, Fort Bragg-based Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair, faces a long list of charges including forcible sodomy, wrongful sexual conduct, violating orders, engaging in inappropriate relationships and adultery. Sinclair is accused of forcing women to . have sex with him during combat tours and threatening at least one . victim's life, as well as her career and the lives of her relatives if . she told anyone about his actions. Charged: Army Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair has been charged with forcible sodomy, multiple counts of adultery and having inappropriate relationships with several female subordinates . Prosecutors allege . that the married general committed sex crimes against five women . including four military subordinates and civilian between 2007 and 2012 . in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Germany. The 27-year Army . veteran was deputy commander in charge of logistics and support for the . 82nd Airborne Division in Afghanistan before being abruptly relieved in . May. Rebecca Sinclair's . piece was published just days after retired Gen. David Petraeus . admitted having an affair with his biographer and resigned as director . of the CIA. During the . investigation into the affair, the FBI uncovered flirtatious emails . between Gen. John Allen, the top American commander in Afghanistan, and a . Florida socialite. Both were married. Grave allegations: Sinclair, left, pictured laughing with elder Afghan leaders, has been accused by female subordinates of forcing them to send him their nude photos . Defense: Sinclair's wife of 27 years came to his defense, writing in an op-ed piece that the open-ended wars and years spent apart are partially to blame for sex scandals in the Army . In her 800-word . piece in The Washington Post published November 15, Rebecca Sinclair . said that her husband of 27 years spent more than six years in the past . decade away from his family and that they moved six times in 11 years. ‘Spectators will . try to make this scandal about many things: the arrogance of powerful . men; conniving mistresses; the silent epidemic of sexual assault in the . armed services. But these explanations obscure an underlying problem: . the devastating influence of an open-ended war – now in its 11th year – . on the families of U.S. service members,’ she wrote. Rebecca Sinclair . said the distance apart isn't an excuse for infidelity. But she said . this is the only time in history the U.S. has fought for a decade with . an all-volunteer force. ‘Nothing good can come of families being chronically separated for a decade or more,’ she wrote. She said many military spouses don't have any good options after finding . out a husband or wife was unfaithful. If they leave, they risk losing . the financial security of military salary, pension, housing and health . benefits. Spectators will try to make this scandal about many things: the arrogance of powerful men; conniving mistresses; the silent epidemic of sexual assault in the armed services. But these explanations obscure an underlying problem: the devastating influence of an open-ended war — now in its 11th year — on the families of U.S. service members. Let me first address the elephant in the room. My husband had an affair. He violated our marriage vows and hurt me tremendously. Jeff and I are working on our marriage, but that’s our business. The officer corps is plagued by leaders abandoning their families and forging new beginnings with other men and women. And many wives know about their husbands’ infidelity but stay silent. For military wives, the options are bad and worse. Stay with an unfaithful husband and keep your family intact; or lose your husband, your family and the financial security that comes with a military salary, pension, health care and housing.We have moved six times in 11 years. On average, our kids change schools every two years. Between five deployments, site surveys and training operations, Jeff has spent more than six of the past 10 years away from his family. This is the only time in U.S. history that our nation has fought a decade-long war with a volunteer Army. Doing so has consequences. Nothing good can come of families being chronically separated for a decade or more. It will take years for Jeff to shed the false image of a hard-drinking, porn-dependent aggressor. The other generals will also struggle to rehabilitate reputations they spent decades building. All of these men are human beings, with strengths and fallibilities, and they have families who are under real strain. Source:Washingtonpost.com . ‘Because we move . so often, spouses lose years of career advancement,’ she said. ‘Some of . us spend every other year as single parents. We are vulnerable . emotionally and financially. Many stay silent out of necessity, not . natural passivity.’ Rebecca Sinclair . also wrote that she supports her husband fighting the charges against . him. She said she thinks many of the charges will be dropped because the . evidence isn't strong. ‘But the damage . has been done,’ she writes at the end of her piece. ‘It will take years . for Jeff to shed the false image of a hard-drinking, porn-dependent . aggressor. The other generals will also struggle to rehabilitate . reputations they spent decades building. ‘All of these men . are human beings, with strengths and fallibilities, and they have . families who are under real strain. How we address this strain will say . much about what kind of country we are; it will also determine how . stable and strong our military is.’ Mrs Sinclair's . impassioned defense of her husband comes a little more than a week after . two female Army officers testified that Gen Sinclair had forced them to . provide him with their nude photos. A . married captain testified that Sinclair repeatedly . asked her to send him nude photos of herself, which she said made her . uncomfortable. Eventually, she said she placated the married general by . sending him downloaded pornographic photos of other women cropped so . that their faces weren't visible. The damaging . testimony came last Wednesday during a hearing at Fort Bragg to . determine whether Sinclair will go on trial for multiple criminal . charges including forcible sodomy, wrongful sexual conduct and adultery, . which is a crime under the military justice system. The allegations . against Sinclair involve relationships with five women other than his wife. On Tuesday a former subordinate to Sinclair testified that her superior . officer started an affair with her in Iraq and later threatened to kill . her and her family if she told anyone. The . woman says she was honored at first by the attention from Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair, who she said was highly regarded. They first had sex . in 2008 at a forward operating base in Iraq, she said. 'I . was extremely intimated by him. Everybody in the brigade spoke about . him like he was a god,' the woman said, as Sinclair rolled his eyes and . appeared visibly annoyed during her testimony. Now a captain, she was testifying on the second day of a military . hearing at Fort Bragg, N.C., on whether there is enough evidence to . court-martial Sinclair on charges including forcible sodomy, wrongful . sexual conduct and engaging in inappropriate relationships. Disgraced hero: The 27-year Army veteran was deputy commander in charge of logistics and support for the 82nd Airborne Division in Afghanistan before being abruptly relieved in May . Promiscuous: Prosecutors believe Sinclair committed sex crimes against five women in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Germany . She had earlier testified how he had grabbed her by the neck and forcibly sodomized her. During the testimony, Sinclair repeatedly rolled his eyes, sighed audibly and stared at his former aide from the defense table. She did not look at him. The captain testified that she believed Sinclair's threats because he had gone through special forces training, knew how to kill with his hands and had a reputation as a killer in battle. Sinclair was deputy . commander in charge of logistics and support for the 82nd Airborne . Division in Afghanistan before being abruptly relieved in May amid a . criminal probe. He has been on special assignment since then at Fort . Bragg, the sprawling base that is home to the 82nd Airborne. Sinclair's . former commanding officer, Maj. Gen. James Huggins, testified on Monday . that he launched the criminal investigation that led to the charges . after the female captain told him Sinclair forced her to have sex. Trial continues: Sinclair's trial is now in its third day at Fort Bragg and witnesses continue to come forward . Huggins said that on March 19, the captain came to his office late at night in tears. She reported that she had been involved in a three-year sexual affair with Sinclair, then her direct commander and a married man. Adultery is a crime under the military code of justice. Huggins said he knew the female officer to be a good soldier whom Sinclair had specifically asked to have transferred under his command. According to Huggins, the captain said Sinclair had once forced her to perform oral sex on him, but that she also had sex willingly with her boss at Army bases in the United States and on deployments to Germany, Iraq and at the airborne division's headquarters in Afghanistan. When she had tried to end the affair, Sinclair had threatened her and persisted in pushing for sex, according to Huggins' testimony. But she also told Huggins she finally decided to report Sinclair after finding emails exchanged with other women in his account. Sinclair is accused of 26 . violations of military law including forcible sodomy, wrongful sexual . conduct, possessing pornography while deployed and conduct unbecoming of . an officer. Sinclair's . attorney asked for the charges to be thrown out, arguing that . prosecutors had read confidential emails between the general and his . defense. Defense attorney Lt. Col. Jackie Thompson said this violated . his client's rights and asked that new prosecutors be brought in to try . the case.","Jeffrey Sinclair is accused of sodomy, forcing women to send him naked photos and threatening violence against a subordinate .

"Thirty years after he became the face of the worst industrial disaster in the world, former Union Carbide chief executive officer (CEO) Warren Anderson has breathed his last at the age of 92. Strangely, a month passed by before the world even got a whiff about the death of a man India had sought for prosecution since that fated December of 1984. Anderson, who died at a nursing home in the US state of Florida on September 29, was the chairman of Union Carbide when a gas leak at its Bhopal-based subsidiary killed thousands on the night of December 2 and mortally wounded hundreds of others. Female demonstrators hold posters demanding Anderson's extradition from America . Thousands more continue to suffer from ailments caused by the toxic methyl isocyanate, used in the production of a pesticide at Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL), with the harmful effects passed on to the following generation. The news of Anderson’s death has come as a blow to the victims and survivors of the tragedy, who had been demanding his extradition from the US and prosecution for UCIL’s fatal negligence. What makes it worse for them is the fact that Anderson was allowed to get away (see accompanying story) after a perfunctory arrest in Bhopal four days after the tragedy. Warren Anderson died at a Florida nursing home a month ago, on September 29 . No responsibility . Shamshad Bi (55), who lost her five-year-old son Rajain that night and her husband to the gas’s lingering effects a few years later, says she wanted to kill Anderson. “But now I can’t. However, when I die, I will search for him up there and throttle him, to make him experience what my son and the thousands of other victims did,” she added. Tulsi Yadav was just 12 years old at the time of the disaster. At 42, her life continues to be defined by that night, restricted to her house in the Gas Rahat Widhwa Colony owing to her deteriorating health. “The gas leak killed my father, damaged my immune system and left me disabled for life,” she said. Tulsi takes the news of Anderson’s death with a sense of resignation. “He may have escaped prison and the victims, but he was unable to escape death,” she added. Living a nightmare . Aneesa Bi is seething with bitter resentment, directed more at the Indian government than Anderson. “The government kept ignoring the Anderson extradition case. His case must have been expedited,” she said. “The blame lies with the successive governments. They didn’t care, because when people like us were exposed to the gas, they were safely ensconced in their bungalows and offices,” she added. As soon as the American daily New York Times broke the news of Anderson’s death and news television channels caught on, survivors of the tragedy and representatives of organisations working for them assembled outside the derelict premises where the factory was based. A common refrain among the demonstrators was the government’s failure to bring Anderson to India and punish him. The prospect of that succour is lost forever now. “India’s extradition request for Warren Anderson remained under examination and the US Department of Justice did not take a decision either way,” Abdul Jabbar, convener of the Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sangathan (GPMUS) said, citing a Central Bureau of Investigation report from April 2013. The CBI, probing the incident, had submitted the report in a Bhopal court. In the report, the CBI stated that the Ministry of External Affairs had presented a status report on Anderson's extradition which clearly stated that, as on January 2012, no action had been taken and the matter was still under examination, Jabbar added. ‘Negligence’ The fact came to light after the GPMUS and Bhopal Gas Peedit Sangharsh Sahyog Samiti moved an application in December 2012 requesting the Bhopal chief judicial magistrate to direct the CBI to present a status report on Anderson’s extradition, explaining the delay. India had considered Anderson a fugitive because despite the fact that his bail in those initial days was conditioned on his return, he never did, ignoring the multiple summons issued to him over the years. The Madhya Pradesh government confirmed 3,787 deaths as a result of the tragedy, but unofficial estimates placed the toll at 15,000. More than a half-million people were injured, with many dying from illnesses including lung cancer, kidney failure and liver disease. Eight Indian officials, including former UCIL chairman Keshub Mahindra, were convicted on negligence charges in 2010 and sentenced to two years in prison. The nightmare, meanwhile, continues for the victims of that “negligence”. How Anderson eluded us . The leak from Union Carbide's Bhopal-based pesticide factory killed thousands immediately . Four days after a deadly gas leak at Union Carbide’s plant in Bhopal killed thousands in 1984, the company’s chairman, Warren Anderson, was arrested on his arrival in the capital of Madhya Pradesh. But after being held under house arrest for only a few hours, Anderson posted bail and quickly left the country, never returning to face trial. Several reports have suggested that the government of PM Rajiv Gandhi was pressured by the US to let Anderson go. Senior Congress leader Arjun Singh, who was then the chief minister of MP, wrote in his autobiography A Grain of Sand in the Hourglass of Time that home secretary R.D. Pradhan called him “on the instructions of the then Union home minister P.V. Narasimha Rao”. Pradhan denied the allegation, saying he was chief secretary of Maharashtra at the time and became Union home secretary only in January 1985. Singh died in 2011 after a prolonged illness. Moti Singh, who was the Bhopal collector at the time of the disaster, said Anderson managed to get away by using a phone in the room where he was detained to contact persons in the US. “Had we removed the landline phone from his room, Anderson would not have escaped. He possibly made calls to contacts in the US to help him leave India,” Singh added. The US embassy reportedly mounted pressure on the Indian government, which released Anderson on a personal bond of Rs 25,000. Anderson never returned to face trial and was declared a fugitive by the Indian courts. Rights activists have blamed successive governments for failing to secure the extradition of the man who was held responsible for the death of around 15,000 people. Over half a million people were injured by the gas, and many of them died slowly from illnesses like lung cancer, kidney failure and liver disease. Anderson was arrested after the CBI took over the investigation on December 6, 1984. While he was being held at the Union Carbide guest house, he spoke to Indian officials and legal advisers of the company. The six-foot-two-inch tall executive, then aged 63, wanted to visit the factory but was discouraged by the local administration. Swaraj Puri, Bhopal’s Superintendent of Police in 1984, claimed Anderson was arrested on a written order and released on an oral order. “We arrested him on the basis of a written order but released him on an oral order,” Puri told the Union Carbide Toxic Gas Leakage Enquiry Commission. He added that the oral order came “from higher-ups”.","Warren Anderson was chairman of Union Carbide when a gas leak at its Bhopal-based subsidiary killed thousands .

"A former model has told how she dieted down to a dangerously low 115lbs following her agent's orders. Meredith Hattam, 27, revealed in a personal essay for VICE that when she entered the industry she was issued a strict diet plan to help her lose around two inches off her slender 135lb, 5ft 9in frame. 'I didn’t understand that 800 calories a day . countered by two hours of exercise was a starvation diet, something . capable of doing long-term damage to my metabolism,' the brunette recalled. Frail and miserable: Meredith Hattam from New York said she dieted down to a dangerously low 115lbs following her agent's orders - her she is pictured at her thinnest, aged 19 . Bread was off limits and only sources of lean protein including chicken, fish, steamed vegetables, almonds and eggs were allowed. Over a seven-week period she lost 20lbs - taking her down to a tiny size two - and was promptly sent off to work in New York City. Although her agency was thrilled with her new gaunt look, Ms Hattam, then aged 19, said she felt 'miserable and frail'. 'I would walk miles around the city for hours on end just to burn off any food I'd ingested' In . New York it was a struggle to keep the weight off, but new jobs and . praise from her reps made Ms Hattam believe it was all worth while. However, her unhealthy habits soon spiraled out of control. 'I binged at free dinners provided by promoters and punished myself afterwards by not eating for days,' she said. 'I would walk miles around the city for hours on end just to burn off any food I'd ingested.' In a good place: The California native, who currently works as graphic designer, is now a healthy size four and does not know how much she weighs . Eventually she burned herself out and returned home to San Diego where she checked in for therapy. Realizing that modeling wasn't doing her . any good, she chose another career path and completed a degree in media . studies. Today she works in New York as a freelance graphic designer. She told MailOnline that she feels in 'a . good place' now but it took her a longtime to recover and craft a . self-identity outside of modeling. 'Do not model if you can't model... I wouldn't recommend modeling to teenagers at all' In a bid to help others in her position, she wants the fashion industry to promote a healthier body image and is a supporter of the Model Alliance, a non-profit which fights for models' rights. Asked what her message is to other young girls, she replied: 'Do not model if you can't model. If you are tall and thin, don't let a scout or agent persuade you to lose weight or change yourself, or else you may pay the psychological tow. 'Also, do not feel like you need to do anything you don't want to do. 'You are in charge of your life - if you really do want to lose weight and be a model, consult a nutritionist, talk with your family, and do it in a healthy way. I wouldn't recommend modeling to teenagers at all.' According to a 2012 study conducted by the Model Alliance 68.3per cent of models admit to suffering from depression or anxiety.","Meredith Hattam, 27, from New York said she felt 'miserable and frail'

A 40-year-old man who was walking nearby was also hit and suffered a broken hip. At the time of the incident, Prime Minister David Cameron, who is the MP for Witney, expressed his condolences on Twitter. Meanwhile, Sophie Hicks, 14, a friend of the three victims, said she usually accompanied the girls but had stayed at home yesterday because she was ill. She said of Liberty: ‘She was one of my best friends. It doesn’t quite seem real, I feel numb. I was on the phone to Mercy and she said they couldn’t watch as Liberty was getting CPR.

"A rare tornado ripped roofs off buildings, uprooted trees and shattered windows Thursday afternoon in the southwest Washington city of Longview, but there were no reports of injuries. A National Weather Service storm survey team from nearby Portland, Oregon, estimated the EF1 tornado carved a path of 1.3 miles and packed winds of 86 to 110 mph, meteorologist Miles Higa said.

A rare tornado ripped down power lines and damaged property Thursday in the city of Longview in Washington state, but there were no immediate reports of injuries, officials said . Still, police and fire crews responded quickly to the hardest-hit area and cordoned it off with help from the National Guard, which has an armory nearby, Jurmu said. Police Chief Jim Duscha told the Daily News of Longview the full extent of damage wouldn't be known until Friday. One witness told KOIN 6 News he 'saw pieces of things flying through the air', and saw the roof of a local business, Carl's Towing, 'blown 100 feet up in the air'. Crews quickly started cleaning up under sunny skies that followed the windstorm. Roofs were torn off an assisted living building and a towing company structure, the newspaper reported. Tornadoes are rare in Washington state and the Pacific Northwest, where the nearby Pacific Ocean generally prevents severe temperature changes. The Rev. Eric Atcheson said he saw the funnel cloud form and touch down near his church. He barely made it inside before the wind tore through an alley between two church buildings. 'There is a pre-school in the building, so I was able to make sure all our kids and teachers are safe,' he said. Ripped up: Many trees were uprooted during the tornado and fell onto the streets .

The church didn't sustain any damage but several trees were knocked down, he said. At Manchester Brothers appliance and sporting goods store, a large piece of roof from another building crashed through a store window and pushed a row of refrigerators about a foot from where they had been sitting. After the roof section blew through, 'it was just absolutely howling. It was deafening', Ian McNew told KATU-TV. 'That's when we took cover. 'It ripped the back door, it's a security door, it ripped it right off its hinges.' No one in the store was hurt. Andy Bernard took a break from carving pumpkins at his home to see what was making so much noise. That's when the tornado lifted his outdoor trampoline. Debris: Residents reported that winds exceeding 100 miles an hour knocked down trees and left debris in the streets that was later cleared . 'It decided to take flight right at me and I ducked and the trampoline went into the house and it sucked it back out and up and over the roof and the garage, and down three quarters of the block,' he told KGW-TV.

'I saw what looked like an enormous dust devil and then these large panels off a roof started falling everywhere,' he told KGW.

"Former CIA Director David Petraeus has told Congress that the CIA believed almost immediately that al-Qaeda-linked terrorists were behind the September 11th attacks in Benghazi, according to a leading Republican congressman. Representative Peter King of New York, a member of the House Intelligence Committee that Petraeus briefed, said that the former general left a 'different impression' today than he had when he testified on Capitol Hill three days after the attack. Now, King said, Petraeus insisted that the 'original talking points prepared by the CIA were different than the final ones put out' and used by Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, on Sunday talk shows to say - incorrectly - that the attack was sparked by anger over an anti-Islam video made in California. Scroll down for video . Lawyering up: Former General David Petraeus has hired a top Washington lawyer to help with his transition out of government and public life . Guarded: A Capitol Hill Police officer guards a staircase near the hearing room where former CIA Director David Petraeus is testifying . The only glimpse media got of Petraeus, right, followed by security agents, was as he entered his home in Arlington Friday afternoon . 'The original talking points were much . more specific about al-Qaeda involvement and yet the final ones just . said ""indications of extremists"" even though it was clearly evident to . the CIA that there was al-Qaeda involvement,' King said. The former CIA director was giving classified testimony and was accompanied by a CIA analyst. King said he did not speak under oath. Petraeus arrived early Friday for closed hearings on Capitol Hill as lawmakers seek details from the retired general about the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. King said that there was only brief mention by Petraeus of his affair with biographer Paula Broadwell, which triggered his shock resignation last Friday. 'He was asked at the start did that have any impact on his testimony, he said no...10 seconds into it, that was off to the side.' After the closed door hearing Rep. Peter King told the media that Petraeus's original talking points were different than the ones put out by the White House and Susan Rice . Looking for answers: Packs of reporters and camera crews were on hand at the US Capitol hoping to catch Petraeus at the highly-anticipated, closed-door hearing of the House Intelligence Committee but only found committee members like Florida Rep. Charles Willima 'Bill' Young . In defense: Petraeus testified that the original CIA talking points showed a clear al-Qaeda involvement that Susan Rice ignored in her later statements . Circus: Petraeus' affair with writer Paula Broadwell turned the days testimony into a media circus as writers and photographers scrambled catch the general . The New York congressman said that Petraeus had explained that the talking points ultimately used by Rice had been altered by inputs by a number of other government agencies after the CIA had made its assessment. 'He said that it goes though a long process, an interagency process and when they came back it was taken out.' The House Intelligence Committee, which was hearing from Petraeus before he briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee, met in a secure room several floors below the main area of the Capitol Visitors Centre, where tourists gather when they are visiting Congress. Republicans and some Democrats have demanded an explanation of why . the Obama administration initially described the attack at Benghazi as a . protest gone awry, leading to the deaths of U.S. Ambassador Christopher . Stevens, diplomat Sean Smith and CIA contractors and former Navy SEALS Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods. Guarded: Police officers guard the Restricted Access-Secure Room as the House Intelligence Committee conducts a hearing on Benghazi with testimony from David Petraeus . On record: These stairs lead to the Capitol Visitors Center . Friday morning testimony happened in a secure room several floors below the main area of the Visitors Center . Five days after attack, the administration sent Rice onto the Sunday news shows to describe what precipitated the . assault. She relied on initial intelligence talking points that subsequently proved . incorrect. Deputy CIA Director Mark Morell told the House committee on Thursday . that Rice was provided with an unclassified version of events at the . American mission, according to Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a committee . member. The assessment concluded that a spontaneous protest over an . anti-Muslim video had evolved into an attack on the American consulate, a . description that Rice presented in the television interviews. Patraeus hoped that by testifying he would put an end to some of the wilder rumors following his resignation over reveal of his affair with Paula Broadwell. 'He did not like the conspiracies going around that somehow he had something to hide on Benghazi,' said retired Colonel Peter Mansoor, who served as Petraeus' executive officer in Iraq. 'I think his offer to testify crossed with the Congress' request to him to testify. But anyway he looks forward to that.' David Petraeus, former CIA director, has testified on Capitol Hill that 'talking points' on Benghazi initially prepared by the CIA were subsequently altered before being given to Ambassador Susan Rice. Far from expressing spontaneous or even personal opinions, Obama administration officials appearing on Sunday talk shows, as Rice did in the aftermath of the September 11th Benghazi attack, are given a virtual script beforehand. These are usually distributed on Saturday night, when a conference call or meeting is held to go over key points. As President Obama put in this week, Rice 'made an appearance at the request of the White House in which she gave her best understanding of the intelligence that had been provided to her'. When foreign policy is involved, these 'talking points' are coordinated by the National Security Council after inputs from agencies throughout the U.S. government. Representative Peter King of the House Intelligence Committee spoke on Friday of an 'interagency process' that Petraeus had said had changed the initial CIA assessment of the events in Benghazi. 'He said that the talking points that were drafted [by the CIA] were specific about an al-Qaeda affiliate...after they went through that process, whatever that process is, which they seem unclear about, that was taken out.' King added that he had 'got the impression about seven, eight, nine different agencies' had been involved in drafting the talking points. There are 16 different agencies in the U.S. intelligence community. In addition, it is overseen by the Directorate of National Intelligence (DNI), which almost certainly would have had an input. In the case of Benghazi, the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), National Security Agency (NSA) and FBI would almost certainly have been involved in drafting the talking points. The State Department would also have had a key role, perhaps drawing on work from its Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR), one of the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies. As well as the DIA input, the Pentagon and perhaps the U.S. Special Operations Command would have been consulted. Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat, said that Petraeus had disputed Republican suggestions that politics were involved in altering the talking points. 'There was an inter-agency process to draft it, not a political process. They came up with the best assessment without compromising classified information or sources or methods. So changes were made to protect classified information.' 'The general was adamant there was no politicisation of the process, no White House interference or political agenda. -BY TOBY HARNDEN . 'I think his offer to testify crossed with the Congress' request to him to testify. But anyway, he looks forward to that.' This comes as the former CIA director . told his close friend Mansoor that he was ignoring the media firestorm . that has erupted in the wake of his resignation. Petraeus hopes that by offering to give testimony he will clear up some of the wilder rumours that are circulating. 'He did not like the conspiracies . going around that somehow he had something to hide on Benghazi,' said . retired Colonel Peter Mansoor who served as Petraeus' executive officer . in Iraq.

With dozens of journalists waiting for a glimpse of the retired four-star general, and a chance to ask about his affair with writer Paula Broadwell, David Petraeus resorted to cloak-and-dagger techniques to sneak into the hearing on the Sept. 11 attacks in Benghazi undetected. Petraeus stole into the House Intelligence Committee hearing through a network of underground hallways leading to a secure room, his entrance hidden from the cameras. CIA directors usually walk through the building's front door. Petraeus is under investigation by the agency for possible wrongdoing though for the day at least that was not the subject of his appearance. Lawmakers said they were looking forward to hearing Petraeus' thoughts on the attacks. 'Director Petraeus went to Tripoli and interviewed many of the people involved,' said head of the Senate committee, California Democrat Dianne Feinstein. 'Id like to get a sense of why it took as long as it did to get a more accurate assessment of what took place in Benghazi,' said California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff.","Petraeus testified that he always knew the attack was linked to al-Qaeda .

'When the Doctor does hear these claims, he immediately pours scorn on them, dismissing them out of hand as a ‘con’ and a ‘racket’.

"The Ebola outbreak risks unleashing an economic catastrophe that will leave a 'lost . generation' of West Africans, Liberian President Ellen . Johnson Sirleaf has said. The president made a desperate appeal for help from every nation with the capacity to do so, describing the initial reaction as 'inconsistent and lacking in clear direction or urgency'. She said the international community had woken up to the . global health risk posed by the epidemic but added that her country had been brought to 'a standstill' and was desperate for funding and medical supplies. President EllenJohnson Sirleaf said the international community had woken up to the global health risk posed by Ebola but said her country had been brought to 'a standstill' and was desperate for medical supplies . 'We all have a stake in the battle against Ebola,' President Johnson Sirleaf said . in an open letter read on the BBC World Service. 'It is the duty of all of us, as global citizens, to send a . message that we will not leave millions of West Africans to fend . for themselves against an enemy that they do not know, and . against whom they have little defence.' She noted that Liberia and two other badly hit countries - Guinea and Sierra Leone - were already weakened by years of war. 'There is no coincidence Ebola has taken hold in three fragile states - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - all battling to overcome the effects of interconnected wars,' the leader said. She pointed out that Liberia once had 3,000 medical doctors, but by the end of its 1989-2003 civil war the country had just 36. The Ebola epidemic remains out of control in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, with the death toll topping 4,500 . President Johnson Sirleaf, a former senior World Bank executive, said . Ebola was having a dire economic impact in the worst affected . countries, with harvests missed, markets shut and borders . closed. 'Ebola is not just a health crisis - across West Africa, a . generation of young people risk being lost to an economic . catastrophe,' she said. President Johnson Sirleaf insisted that the whole world had a stake infighting the deadly virus . 'The time for talking or theorizing is . over. Only concerted action will save my country, and our . neighbours, from experiencing another national tragedy.' The total death toll of the Ebola outbreak, first detected in March deep in the forests of southern Guinea, has risen to more than 4,500, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Although Senegal and Nigeria have been declared Ebola-free, the epidemic remains out of control in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. WHO warns that by December there could be as many as 10,000 new infections per week. The deadly virus has also reached Spain and the United States but outbreaks have been contained so far. President Barack Obama has appealed for Americans not to give in . to hysteria or fear. Winner of the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize, President Johnson Sirleaf insisted that the whole world had a stake in . fighting the virus. She said: 'This disease respects no borders. It is the duty of all of . us, as global citizens, to send a message that we will not leave . millions of West Africans to fend for themselves against an . enemy that they do not know, and against whom they have little . defence.' The United Nations has established a regional headquarters for the response to Ebola in Accra, Ghana. The director of WHO Margaret Chan was scheduled to attend a meeting in Ghana but did not make any public appearances, cancelling a scheduled press conference Saturday. Ms Chan and WHO have come under scrutiny following an internal document obtained by The Associated Press which said the UN health organization did not respond adequately to contain the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. President Johnson Sirleaf appealed to the international community not to leave millions of West Africans to fight the disease alone, as Ebola knows 'no borders' and it is the duty of all people to battle the virus .

"Left-handed people have a ‘strikingly higher’ chance of suffering from schizophrenia, research suggests. A study revealed left-handers accounted for 40 per cent of those with the mental illness. However, only around 10 per cent of the general population is left-handed. Famous left-handers: Prince William, left, and Barack Obama. It is also seen as a sign of greatness . It is thought that the changes in the brain that make people left-handed may also contribute to schizophrenia. Famous left-handers include Prince William, Barack Obama, David Cameron, Sir Paul McCartney, Nicole Kidman and Angelina Jolie. Left-handers are more likely to develop psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, than mood disorders, research suggests (posed by model) Several US presidents have also written with their left hand, including George Bush Snr and Bill Clinton. Ronald Reagan is said to have been ambidextrous. Four of the five original designers of the Macintosh computer were left-handed, as were one in four Apollo astronauts. Researcher Jadon Webb, of Yale University, US, said: ‘Our results show a strikingly higher prevalence of left-handedness among patients presenting with psychotic disorders.’ In contrast, just 10 per cent of those being treated for bipolar disorder or depression were left-handed – a figure much more in line with the rate of left-handedness in the general population. Nick Craddock, a psychiatrist at Cardiff University, said: ‘This link between handedness and psychosis builds on previous work that seeks to understand how the development and connections within the brain help us better understand schizophrenia. That is an important prelude to developing better treatments.’ The study, published in the journal Sage Open, could also help remove some of the stigma surrounding the illness. Professor Craddock added: ‘It also serves to highlight that severe psychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia have a very real physical basis in the brain and body and are not just “all in the mind”.’ Despite the link, most schizophrenics are not left-handed – and most people who are left-handed do not develop schizophrenia. Independent minds? Mr Cameron may be left-handed but Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, left, is not . Some argue that the dominance of lefties in the top  is simply a coincidence and the numbers will even out over time. Others claim left-handedness is associated with greater levels of creativity and skill - a disproportionate number of gifted artists, musicians and sportsmen are left-handed. Or it could simply be that living in a right-handed world means left-handers get used to fighting for their rights from an early age. The proportion of left-handers in Britain as a whole has risen fourfold in the past 100 years. Around 13 per cent of men and 11 per cent of women are now left-handed, compared to just 3 per cent of those born before 1910. Experts say the rise can be partly explained by a growing acceptance of left-handedness. In the 18th and 19th centuries it was regarded as a handicap and teachers would try to beat it out of their pupils, or tie their hand behind their back to train them to use their ‘correct’ hand.","Study in the journal Sage Open found 40 per cent of sufferers left-handed .

The burly Traficant had cut a singular figure in Congress, . sporting dated bell-bottom pants and a mound of spiky hair, . which was revealed to be a toupee when he went to prison. He was known for frequent one-minute floor speeches - rants . against free trade, foreign aid, the Internal Revenue Service . and anything else he depicted as beating down his struggling . constituents. 'Beam me up,' he would say, quoting from Star Trek and . asking to be removed from what he saw as Washington absurdities. A Democrat who often bucked his own party, Traficant managed . to deliver federal money and projects to his district, which . suffered from steel mill closures and high unemployment. Traficant grew up in eastern Ohio and played quarterback at . the University of Pittsburgh. He was drafted, but released, by . the Pittsburgh Steelers professional football team. He was elected Mahoning County sheriff in 1980 and became . known for refusing to foreclose on out-of-work steelworkers. While sheriff, Traficant successfully defending himself . against charges of taking payoffs from mobsters to overlook . loan-sharking, prostitution and drug trafficking. He convinced . the jury he took the money in a one-man sting operation. Publicity from that trial was Traficant's springboard to . Congress. He was elected in 1984. While he was in Congress, a U.S. tax court ruled that he . owed more than $100,000 in back taxes on bribes. Still, he kept getting elected. Many voters viewed him as a . champion of the regular guy and reveled in his earthy, . in-your-face style. A judge in 2002 sentenced him to eight years in prison after . he was convicted of making his staff give him a portion of their . paychecks and do chores on his farm and boat, as well as of . taking bribes and favors from businessmen, and for concealing . all this on his tax returns. Traficant - seen here arriving for his sentencing hearing on bribery, tax evasion and racketeering charges in 2002 - had been in a critical conidtion since the accident on Wednesday . As he faced prison, Youngstown celebrated his folk-hero . status when a local minor league baseball team gave free entry . to fans wearing bad wigs and those who declared themselves to be 'a son of a truck driver', one of his frequent declarations. Traficant ran for reelection from prison but lost. He emerged from prison in 2009 and made an unsuccessful . attempt to reclaim his old congressional seat. He is survived by his wife, Patricia, and two daughters.","Onetime Ohio populist in the U.S. House of Representatives died Saturday .

"No feminist: Today's feminism is utterly irrelevant to Angela . When Newsnight's Emily Maitlis asked me during a debate on the programme this week whether I was a feminist, I hoped my blow-dried hair and figure-hugging dress would give her some clue as to the answer. Feeling a little mischievous, I was tempted to ask her whether I looked like one of those grumpy women in bad clothes who spend their days in a state of agitation about whether it's right to let girls play with dolls. But since I was a guest on the BBC's flagship news programme, I decided to park the sarcasm and simply say that I am not: that today's feminism is utterly irrelevant to me. I explained to Emily and my fellow panellists, Professor Mary Beard and Natascha McElhone, that feminism has betrayed its roots and deteriorated into spurious artificial engineering. Rather than campaigning to help women, feminists today are more likely to be picking fights on Twitter, or dressing up petty grievances as proof of rampant 'sexism'. And, needless to say, these devotees of 'equality' believe you can't be a feminist unless you're Left-wing. Spoiling for a fight is the default position of today's chippy feminists. They've turned nit-picking into an art form - and I told Emily as much. No sooner had I said this than I'd elicited the ire of what I call the 'hash-tag sisters' - those liberal commentators on Twitter who rushed to attack me for my unfashionable conviction that feminism has lost its meaning. I was accused of espousing views which are 'poisonous to society', and called 'sad', 'ignorant' and 'stupid'. Someone bitterly declared I must have enjoyed a 'charmed life' - a lazy generalisation by a socialist grudge-bearer who assumes my convictions have been created from a position of privilege. In fact, my parents were of modest means and couldn't afford private school, but I won a scholarship to attend one. At my all-girls' school no one sought out trite examples of discrimination. We were urged to aim high and fulfil our potential. That, after all, is what the Suffragettes did - one of whom was an alumna of my school. Petty: Rather than campaigning to help women, feminist today are more likely to be picking fights on Twitter . Some 100 years after Emily Wilding Davison threw herself under a horse in the name of equality, isn't it perverse that those who would wish to subjugate me are the firebrand feminists who pit sister against sister, denying my view credence? How ironic, I thought, as I scrolled through my Twitter feed, that those who claim to champion women want to bully me for saying I don't believe in a cause they have bastardised. As a university-educated woman who combines a fulfilling career as a journalist and broadcaster with my role as a homemaker for my husband and four children, I have better things to do than spend my days mirthlessly lamenting the lot of women, which is what most feminists seem to do. Indeed, what the sour Lefty Twitterati won't admit is that all the great battles on which feminism was founded have been won - including political representation, and equality in education, the workplace and other areas of public life. What's left is an ugly vacuum occupied by those who will only let you join the sisterhood if you agree to pander to a petty hunt for signs of oppression. Look no further than the campaign by The Women's Room, who railed against the Bank of England for the lack of women on our bank notes, citing this as evidence of discrimination. Spectacularly pointless, surely? An emancipated, financially independent woman couldn't care less whether Jane Austen is emblazoned on a tenner. I don't: I just care that I'm being paid enough of them. 'What the sour Lefty Twitterati won't admit is that all the great battles on which feminism was founded have been won' When I went out to splash some of my hard-earned cash on a beautiful new dress this week, I didn't take a blind bit of notice of the images on the notes I was spending. Yet today's misguided women's libbers scrabble around in search of reasons to validate their existence. When it was announced that the Women's Prize for Fiction would be known henceforth as the Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction, acknowledging sponsorship by the liqueur, one sour feminist took to the internet to proclaim that it was 'a reflection of the depressing girlification of culture [as] Baileys is a sweet, sticky drink explicitly marketed at women.' Tell that to my husband, who loves it over ice. Today's feminists appear to be living behind a smoke screen of their own construction, blind to the reality of female achievement in the 21st century, when girls outperform boys at GCSE and in further education. Around 20 per cent more girls make it to university than boys. Today's so-called sisters also refuse to accept that women are wired differently to men - that many see becoming a mother as the crowning achievement of their lives. Who can argue with the female executive who, after delivering her newborn, decides to give up the office and stay at home? I think today's glass ceiling is largely self-imposed, perhaps the result of many deciding to leave full-time employment to put family life first. The sisterhood today: Contemporary feminists would loathe the fact that Angela lets her daughter play with dolls . One survey found that women who own businesses earn nearly 17 per cent more than men in the same position. That's my definition of feminism - not some spurious insistence on female quotas and women-only shortlists. How does that square with sisters doing it  for themselves? If I ever was a feminist, I can't be now - not according to those who loathe the fact I see marriage as more than a piece of paper, that I believe women have no place in a combat zone, and that I know my daughter won't be stereotyped for playing with dolls. I will be disqualified from the 'sisterhood', too, by my hope that as well as having a career, she will meet a man who will love and treasure her. The final irony is that feminism has brought out a touch of the misogynist in me, so ashamed and depressed am I by a once-laudable movement which has corrupted its heritage and condemns me for saying so. For that, I think any sensible woman will join me in feeling saddened by how irrelevant and niche modern feminism has become.","Angela Epstein argues that feminism has lost its meaning .

"The NYPD is investigating the leak of a gruesome video that shows a New York City subway train dragging a man to his death along the tracks. The disturbing footage captures 23-year-old Nyrel Wade's last moments at Penn Station after he walks to the end of the platform and past a 'Do Not Enter' sign to urinate, just after 1am on Saturday. As the Pratt Institute employee walks back, a train leaving the station hits him as he tries to edge around the sign and knocks him to the ground. Scroll Down for Video .

"A former Lord Chancellor has criticised police for ‘inappropriately’ misusing controversial anti-terror powers to spy on journalists. Lord Falconer lashed out at police chiefs who defended the dubious practice of using snooping legislation to identify reporters’ sources. He clashed with Andy Trotter, ex-chief constable of British Transport Police, who insisted there were ‘higher concerns’ than protecting whistleblowers who spoke to the media. Former Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, pictured, criticised the police's excessive use of 'snooping laws' Mr Trotter, until recently the media lead at the Association of Chief Police Officers, said constabularies had used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) ‘entirely properly’. The row deepened after it emerged two police forces used the powers to obtain phone records from the Sun and Mail on Sunday journalists to work out who they were speaking to, in once case sidestepping a judge’s agreement to protect a confidential source. Home Secretary Theresa May has ordered a review into how the powers are being used amid widespread concerns officers are bypassing legal protections. The surveillance watchdog, Sir Paul Kennedy, is also holding a ‘full inquiry’ into officers potentially misusing Ripa by ordering telecommunications companies to hand over call logs belonging to newspapers. The powers require only that a request be approved by a police officer of Superintendent rank or above – effectively giving forces the right to sign off their own warrants. It is claimed officers used Ripa because other laws governing investigations require officers to go before a judge to make the case for seizing journalistic material. Lord Falconer, a member of the Labour Government which brought the powers, said the review by Sir Paul, the Interception of Communications Commissioner, should state that when identification of journalistic sources was an issue, police must seek the permission of the courts. It has emerged that the police secretly obtained phone records of a Mail on Sunday reporter while they were preparing a prosecution against former Liberal Democrat government minister Chris Huhne, pictured . He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘There are provisions in other legislation which say where there’s an issue about identifying a journalistic source, the application for that material should go before a judge so the judge can balance the public interest in making sure there’s a proper investigation against a need to protect journalistic sources. ‘Going and using Ripa involves no such balance - the police can authorise it themselves so nobody ever considers the balance of, for example, protecting sources.’ Lord Falconer said that neither case involved any ‘degree of urgency’ by the police and in one of the cases the judge had taken ‘great steps’ to ensure the identity of a source was concealed. He said: ‘It does look this is not a proper use of the powers.’ He accepted proper safeguards should have been included to protect journalists and their sources when Ripa was first introduced in 2000. But Mr Trotter said he believed police had been using the legislation ‘entirely properly when you look at the seriousness of the cases they were dealing with.’ Former British Transport Police chief constable, Andy Trotter, pictured, defended the practice of the police secretly inspecting the phone records of journalists claiming justice needed all information to come out . He said: ‘It’s about dealing with serious crime that the police forces were in this particular case using the legislation properly and making sure that all the evidence available comes out for victims and for the accused to make sure that nothing is secret, nothing is kept away from the judicial process. ‘Whilst I totally respect the need for journalists to protect their sources and their informants but there are other higher needs for justice to make sure all information comes out, it shouldn’t be secret, it shouldn’t be hidden away.’ Last month it emerged the Metropolitan Police used Ripa powers to obtain telephone records from The Sun newspaper’s newsdesk and those of its political editor, Tom Newton Dunn as part of the Plebgate inquiry. The records were used to uncover who told the newspaper about claims Andrew Mitchell, the then chief whip, described officers as ‘plebs’ after they refused to allow him to cycle through the gates of Downing Street. Then, last week, it emerged police investigating the Chris Huhne speeding points scandal secretly obtained the phone records of journalist on the Mail on Sunday – the Daily Mail’s sister paper – and one of his sources for the story, even though a judge had agreed that the source could remain confidential. Kent Police also used Ripa to find out who spoke to David Dillon, the Mail on Sunday news editor working on the story, and his source, freelance journalist Andrew Alderson, who was given the story by Constance Briscoe. Police and the security sources obtained communications records under Ripa more than 514,000 times last year, nearly 10,000 a week.","Lord Falconer claimed police were misusing stronger anti-terror laws .

"An Oklahoma man has been charged in his aunt's shooting death, telling investigators that he killed the woman to put an end to their incestuous sexual relationship. Mayes County Sheriff Mike Reed said the body of Verna Sarten, 50, was found around 1am Monday by deputies responding to a report of a woman not breathing at the house. Deputies later pulled over the victim's nephew and roommate, 37-year-old Jeremy Sappington, who was driving her pickup truck, and took him into custody. He is now facing a first-degree murder charge. Scroll down for video . Troubled family: Jeremy Sappington (left) has been charged with first-degree murder after confessing that he killed his aunt, Verna Sarten (right), 50, because he no longer wanted to have sex with her . Grisly crime scene: A sheriff's deputy discovered Sarten's body bloodied and naked from the waist down lying on the floor of her home in Chouteau, Oklahoma . According to prosecutors, Sappington shot Sarten in the head with a .22 caliber revolver at her home in the 1400 block of East Jones Street in Chouteau, and then burned a stack of papers with the apparent intent to start a fire before fleeing, Tulsa World reported. When an officer responded to a call from Sarten's relative asking to check up on her just before 1am, he walked inside the house and immediately discovered the woman's bloodied body on the floor next to the couch. Court documents stated that Sarten’s pajama pants and underwear were cast aside on the floor, and there was blood on her face and the carpet. The oven was on with its door ajar and the central heating system was also switched on, according to the affidavit. Jeremy Sappington was initially arrested on suspicion of public intoxication when sheriff's deputies responded to reports of a disturbance on West 590th Street. Damning evidence: Sappington, 37, was pulled over driving the victim's pickup truck, where officers found the alleged murder weapon and a spent shell . Living arrangements: Sarten, pictured with her daughter-in-law, Fonda Thompson, invited her nephew to stay with her and her boyfriend after his divorce . When police searched the Dodge pickup Sappington was driving, they discovered an H & R .22 caliber revolver and a spent shell under the driver's seat. It was later determined that the vehicle belonged to Verna Sarten's boyfriend, Gerald Howard, who was out of town at the time of the killing. During questioning Monday, Sappington allegedly confessed to the murder, telling deputies that he was having sex with Sarten, his mother's sister, in exchange for housing. Matriarch: Verna Sarten (far right) was the sister of Sappington's mother, Veta, who passed away in 1984; the 50-year-old woman leaves behind four grown children and seven grandchildren . The 37-year-old suspect told the deputies that he wanted to break things off with his aunt, so he grabbed a gun that Sarten had been hiding under her mattress, walked up behind her and fired a shot at her head. According to her obituary, Miss Sarten, a certified nursing assistant and avid gardener, is survived by four grown children and seven grandchildren. Sarten's niece - and Sappington's sister - Susan Austin Kerr, who lives in Georgia, told Tulsa World that she and her brother had a rough upbringing, and things only got worse after the passing of their mother, Veta, in 1984. As a teenager, Sappington often got in trouble and was in and out of juvenile detention centers. Pryor Daily Times reported that Sappington moved in with his aunt and her boyfriend after his divorce. Assistant District Attorney Marny Hill said that after Sarten’s shooting, her nephew headed over to his ex-wife’s house, banging on the doors and windows. Sappington is being held without bond due to his extensive criminal record, which includes drug possession, armed robbery, assault, domestic assault and battery, and multiple auto theft charges, according to the station News On 6. He had been sentenced to seven years in prison for attempted larceny of an automobile.","Jeremy Sappington, 37, charged with first-degree murder in shooting death of Verna Sarten, 50 .

"A friend says Heidi denies she and her bodyguard were romantically involved while she was with Seal . Heidi and her bodyguard are currently calling their relationship 'undefined' Friend of the supermodel says it is 'sad' that Seal is making these accusations . When they split up their seven year marriage in January, the world was shocked. Heidi Klum and Seal by all accounts appeared happy, renewing their wedding vows every year and putting on plenty of red-carpet PDA's. But now the Kiss From A Rose singer has sensationally revealed that the 39-year-old German supermodel was having an affair with her bodyguard BEFORE the couple broke up. Did Heidi cheat? Heidi Klum's estranged husband Seal claims that she cheated on him by having an affair with her bodyguard before they separated in January this year . The 49-year-old made the claims last night to TMZ, after pictures emerged this week of his estranged wife cavorting on the beach with her bodyguard. Seal told TMZ that the former Victoria's Secret Angel was having an affair with the security guard before they separated earlier this year. When initially asked what he thought about his former wife moving on with the heavily tattooed man, Seal said: Whilst I didn't expect anything better from him, I would of thought that Heidi would have shown a little more class and at least waited until we separated first before deciding to fornicate with the help. Sensational revelation: The 49-year-old made the claims yesterday to TMZ at LAX airport, after pictures emerged this week of his estranged wife cavorting on the beach with her bodyguard . 'But I guess you all now have the answer you have been looking for for the last seven months.' The British singer added that his top priority was his children's well-being. The singer has three biological children with the Project Runway host, including Henry, six, Johan, five,  and Lou, two. As well as Leni, eight, whom he formally adopted. 'That's what happens when two people separate, they move on and generally meet other people in their lives,' he said. 'I certainly don't expect Heidi to all of a sudden become a nun, but as always my main priority is the emotional well-being of my children, and to be quite honest if there is going to be someone else there in their lives, I would much rather it was a familiar face.'

Close: It . would appear that things are getting serious between the two – which is . hardly a surprise seeing as they already knew each other so well . According to TMZ, Heidi today denied that she cheated on Seal with her bodyguard. The website reports that the supermodel told a friend that while she was still with Seal, the pair's relationship was 'strictly professional.' However, since splitting with the singer in January, Heidi has gotten 'very close' to her security guard. Heidi's friend explained to TMZ that he has been helping her get through her separation from Seal. The couple are now said to classing their relationship as 'undefined'. Heidi's pal said she is not surprised that Seal would make these kinds of accusations. 'It’s sad but not surprising that he would resort to making excuses for their divorce when the real reason is looking him in the mirror,' they told TMZ. Never too far away: Heidi's bodyguard sat close to the star as she got in some sun bathing throughout the day . Seal's sensational revelations come . after pictures emerged this week of Heidi cavorting around with a man believed . to be her bodyguard during a sun-soaked holiday in Sardinia, Italy. She was seen going topless and reclining on a sunlounger with the man in question at a swimming pool, looking loved up. The . pair then showed they have developed a close relationship as Heidi . massaged suncream into her tattooed companion’s shoulders while they . took a dip and later floated around on a lilo. It . would appear that things are getting serious between the two – which is . hardly a surprise seeing as they already knew each other so well. A lot to talk about: The pair chatted all throughout the afternoon . As well as enjoying some romantic alone time by the pool the duo hit the beach with three of Heidi’s children and Heidi’s bodyguard has even met the in-laws in the form of her parents Gunther and Erna. Youngsters Johan, Leni, and Henry, were all on hand for the trip with their famous mother, and were seen playing on the beach together during a day out - while Lou was spotted in Erna's arms later. The bodyguard, who has worked for Heidi since she was still married to Seal, seemed to be getting on well with the children as they larked around together on the sand before he gave Heidi a tender hug. Holiday over: Heidi, her bodyguard beau and her children arrived home earlier this week . Tall and handsome: Heidi's new supposed beau is tall and strapping . However even during the family day out it seems the two couldn’t get enough of each other. They took some time out to go and perch on a rock for a private chat and were very hands on with one another. While Seal is not happy about the couple's union, it appears that he has also moved on his love life with a new partner. Well acquainted: Heidi is seen walking next to her bodyguard as she heads out with Seal and the children in their happier times in June 2011 . Last month he was seen cosying up to a pretty bikini clad brunette on a yacht – also in Sardinia. Seal and Heidi announced their split in January after seven years of marriage and filed for divorce three months later. While their split was initially amicable, it seems things may have turned sour for the pair in the divorce. Work out buddies: Heidi and her fit security guard have often been seen out jogging together and went for a run around Manhattan on Thursday . A source told Star magazine that the supermodel is fuming at her former flame after he reportedly used intimate shots of the children in an ad campaign without her permission. An insider told the publication via Radar Online: ‘Heidi felt that the children had gone through enough since their parents split, and she didn’t want their private moments out there for the world to see. ‘But Seal maintained he had every right to use his personal photos —  and, moreover, that it was a done deal and out of his hands.' The model allegedly hired a lawyer to demand that the company, Leica digital, take down the video – and it was retraced days later.

"The woman who alerted police to  Jesse Matthew has spoken for the first time about the moment she came face-to-face with the man suspected of kidnapping student Hannah Graham. Karen, who did not give her last name, was walking along a beach in Gilchrist, Texas on Wednesday afternoon when a man came speeding alongside her in his car. She said that he slammed on his brakes and brought the car to a halt in the sand - and it was then she recognized him as the man suspected of abducting the missing University of Virginia student. Scroll down for videos . Karen, who did not give her last name, said that she was walking along a beach in Gilchrist, Texas when a man came speeding alongside her in a car and she recognized him instantly as Jesse Matthew . She told ABC13: 'He was very close and looked at me. It was very scary. 'At a glance, I think I resemble Hannah. And I know that's why he did a double take at me, I do. And I knew it was him.' Karen also recognized Matthew from his wanted poster which was issued after he fled Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday. Matthew was arrested at his blue tent on a Texas beach in Gilchrist on Wednesday at 3.30pm after Karen's tip-off. Matthew (pictured in a new mugshot on Wednesday) was caught on a beach in Texas . A sheriff's deputy caught him following a massive manhunt by the FBI and police forces across the U.S. and he was taken into custody without incident. According to CNN, he was held at the scene on the Gilchrist beach for several hours and questioned. It is unclear why Matthew was in Texas although several reports have suggested that he may have been trying to flee to Mexico. Galveston is roughly a nine-hour drive from the Mexico border. He was later caught on camera being led into Galveston County Jail surrounded by law enforcement at 8pm. The 32-year-old was charged on Thursday with being a fugitive from justice and abduction on a Virginia warrant. He also faced a charge of giving false information to a police officer in Texas. He was denied bond on the federal abduction charge and his bond on the Galveston County charge was set at $1,500. Investigators traveled to Texas to interview Matthew who is reportedly not talking. He appeared in court on Thursday where he complained that his clothes had been taken away from him and he had been made to sleep on a hard bed. The 32-year-old, stood in green prison overalls with his hands cuffed in front of him at 8am on Thursday as he appeared, via video link, before Galveston County Judge Mark Henry in Texas. He was charged with abduction in connection with missing UVA student Hannah Graham and waived his extradition to Virginia to stand trial and right to an attorney - but yet all Matthew seemed to be concerned with was his outfit. Karen was walking along with beach in Gilchrist, Texas when she came across fugitive kidnap suspect Jesse Matthew and raised the alarm on Wednesday . The woman who spotted Jesse Matthew on a Texas beach said that she immediately recognized him from his wanted poster . UVA student Hannah Graham, 18, was last seen in the early hours of September 13 in Charlottesville, Virginia. The last person seen with her was Jesse Matthew . After mumbling that he understood the charges against him and his rights, Matthew said: 'Oh sir, I had a question for you. Like, they took all of my clothes and they got me sleeping a [inaudible] thing. I don't feel like I'm... I should be able to have some kind of clothes.' An apparently unimpressed Judge Henry responded curtly: 'You appear to me to be dressed in a jumpsuit.' Matthew responded: 'Well, once I get back they are going to take my jumpsuit off.' The judge explained that he had to be cleared by medical which is why his jumpsuit would be removed but he then would be given the clothing back. Matthew appeared bewildered by the paperwork he was being asked to sign which included a fugitive warrant from Virginia which the judge explained for a second time. He was not asked to enter a plea. With Matthew not talking and police having few updates in the search for the missing teenager at a press conference on Thursday, a new witness has come forward to offer details about the night she disappeared. According to the owner of the bar where was last seen, Miss Graham was so drunk she could barely walk. Tempo Restaurant owner Brice Cunningham said on Thursday that the sophomore, 18, appeared to be incapacitated as she left the nightspot with Jesse Matthew on September 13. Matthew had been drinking at the bar earlier that night before he encountered the 18-year-old  outside on Charlottesville's pedestrian Downtown Mall, Cunningham said. Matthew then briefly re-entered the bar, ordered what credit card records suggest were two beers, and rejoined the teenager outside. The bar's door monitor told police they walked off with Matthew's arm around her for support, he said. Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. is escorted into a courtroom for an appearance before District Court Judge Michelle Slaughter regarding his extradition back to Virginia on Thursday in Galveston, Texas . Kidnapping suspect Jesse 'LJ' Matthew, 32, stood in green prison overalls with his hands cuffed in front of him as charges were read in Galveston on Thursday morning . At a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo returned the focus of the investigation to finding 18-year-old Hannah Graham. He said that his officers were re-interviewing witnesses, canvassing for more surveillance footage and searching properties. The police department has had in the region of 1,600 tips but the chief could offer no more details on the whereabouts of Miss Graham. Chief Longo said: 'The more time that goes by, the more difficult this becomes for everyone but we won't lose hope until we have to.' He was unable to offer further details on the Galveston investigation and and could say no more about the clothing that Charlottesville officers retrieved from Matthew's home because it would be 'prejudicial' to the suspect's trial. He confirmed that Matthew would return to the state of Virginia on Friday or Saturday in the company of state police. Jesse Matthew, 32, pictured in handcuffs, was arrested on Wednesday afternoon on a Texas beach and escorted by sheriff deputies into Galveston County Jail several hours later at 8pm . Just hours before Hannah Graham's disappearance, Jesse Matthew (pictured left) was at a football game at a private school . Meanwhile, it was revealed today that just hours before Graham's disappearance, Matthew was at a football game. The 32-year-old was a part-time volunteer assistant football coach at a private school. Video obtained by NBC 29 shows the 32-year-old suspect on the football field on September 12 at the Covenant School - a Christian liberal arts and sciences school in Charlottesville. Matthew had been on the run since Saturday just hours after he was named by MailOnline as the last person seen with the 18-year-old student on the night she disappeared in Charlottesville, Virginia. MailOnline exclusively revealed on Thursday that Matthew was accused of rape when he studied at Liberty University. Matthew was expelled in 2002 from the Christian university founded by Jerry Falwell in Lynchburg, Virginia, following the alleged sex attack on a female student but was not charged with any crime, former teammates said. Lynchburg City Police investigated the rape allegation and Matthew was named as a suspect, MailOnline has been told. But the student was not arrested or charged, due to lack of evidence. However his scholarship was withdrawn and he was thrown out of the university, his teammates told MailOnline. The reward for information leading to the location of Hannah Graham had increased to $100,000. Police released a new missing person poster for UVA student Hannah Graham who vanished on September 13 in Charlottesville, Virginia. The reward for information has been doubled to $100,000 . Police released this footage in their search for a man in dreadlocks. He has now been revealed to be Jesse 'LJ' Matthew, a nursing assistant at UVA Hospital. Police charged him with abduction on Tuesday . Confusion: This map shows Hannah Graham's movements on the night of Friday 12 and Saturday 13. At 11.50pm she was seen at a party by friends with another male friend. She then seemed to head westward toward the Charlottesville downtown mall .","Karen, who did not give her last name, was walking along a beach in Gilchrist, Texas when a man came speeding along in his car .

"Kneeling on a pillow, surrounded by mothers and their children, the Countess of Wessex looked perfectly at ease as she took part in a musical play session in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, yesterday. Cuddling three-month-old Rowan Wilson-Jones, the royal laughed happily as the youngster sucked on her hand as she joined in on a sing-a-long for toddlers. After greeting flag-waving pupils gathered in the playground of Wittering Primary School, the Countess made her way to the children's centre - which she renamed the Wittering Families' Centre. Scroll down for video . The Countess of Wessex was happy to join in the musical session with families at Wittering Primary School . The mother-of-two looked relaxed as she rocked three-month-old Rowan, who sucked happily on her hand . Sophie playfully covered her ears after little Rowan Wilson-Jones started crying during her visit . There she delighted the children - and their parents - by singing nursery rhymes including Humpty Dumpty and Incy Wincy Spider, according to the community group that organised the session. The Countess, who is a long-standing supporter of children's charities, spent time cuddling the children - rocking three-month-old Rowan  as they took part in the fun with his mother Emma. She looked unfazed as the baby sucked on her hand - looking down and smiling at the little boy. At Wittering Primary School, which she last visited in May last year, Sophie crouched down to speak to the pupils who shrieked with delight as she walked into the playground. She also took the time to speak to a number of different groups and chat to parents. Earlier in the day, the Countess visited RAF Wittering, just south of Stamford, Lincolnshire, in her capacity as Honorary Air Commodore of the station. The helicopter carrying Sophie touched down at the base mid-morning, where she was greeted by pupils from nearby Wittering Primary School. She was handed bouquets by two year six pupils, before she headed to met with service personnel in the officers' mess.

The mother-of-two crouched down to speak to the children who crowded into the playground to see her . Year six pupils Rebecca O’Sullivan and Owen Harrison handed Sophie a bouquet on her arrival to RAF Wittering . While at the base, the Countess watched an aerobatic display and met with members of Cambridge University Air Squadron. The visit came in the wake of a busy month for Sophie, who has spent most of it touring the country and hosting charity suppers at Buckingham Palace. Last week, the Countess delighted pupils at the Royal School for Deaf Children in Margate, where she greeted a number of youngsters with a warm embrace. Earlier that day, the Countess had spent the morning raising the profile of another cause close to her heart, the plight of people suffering from cancer.

"A waitress has claimed that she contracted herpes from a MAC lipstick endorsed by Rihanna at one of the singer's concerts. Starkeema Greenidge, 28, developed mouth sores after a MAC Cosmetics representative applied the 'RiRi Woo' lipstick on her as she attended a show in Brooklyn, New York, she claims in a lawsuit. She is now suing MAC, which launched Rihanna's lipstick in May, after she suffered emotional distress from the ordeal. She was unable to work for two weeks, causing a loss of earnings, she says. Lawsuit: A woman has claimed she contracted herpes from a MAC lipstick endorsed by Rihanna, pictured, after a representative applied some on her at the singer's concert in Brooklyn in May . Greenidge was . at the Rihanna concert at the Barclay's Center on May 7 when she stopped at a MAC . Cosmetics pop-up counter, according to the lawsuit, the New York Daily News reported. A representative used a tube of the . lipstick on her, and when Greenidge asked if it was clean, the woman . replied, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah', Greenidge claims. The employee applied the RiRi Woo red lipstick to her upper lip and instructed her to 'press her lips together and spread the lipstick around', according to the suit. The representative 'didn’t use a fresh or new lipstick tube, but rather one that had been used for other patrons,' the suit alleges. Two days later, Greenidge developed a cold sore on her lip and her doctor diagnosed it as herpes. It caused her mental anguish and emotional distress, she says in her lawsuit. 'I wasn't able to work for two weeks,' Greenidge told the Daily News. 'It cost me a lot of money.'

She is now suing MAC - not Rihanna - for . an unspecified amount and said she brought the case because she wants . the company to be more hygienic in the future. Her lawsuit said the company 'should have known... it was unsanitary and exposing patrons to possible spread of disease'. She added that staff should be trained to use disposable tubes or swabs to apply the lipstick. 'This is going to happen over and over again if nothing is done,' Greenidge said. Rihanna signed a deal with MAC Cosmetics in February for her own line, including the RiRi Woo lipstick, which sold out within minutes of being released on May 2.

"A Perth father who crashed a stolen car and abandoned his injured three-year-old daughter inside the burning vehicle has been jailed for seven-and-a-half years. Bevan Stanley Cameron, 25, was drunk on April 20 when he crashed a stolen car on Great Eastern Highway in Midland. He fled the scene, leaving his daughter in the front passenger seat. Scroll down for video . Bevan Stanley Cameron, 25, was drunk when he crashed a stolen car in April this year . Cameron's daughter, who was just three years old, was injured in the crash but he fled the scene . She was treated for a ruptured bladder, cuts and bruises after the crash in Midland, Perth . He pleaded guilty on Friday in the West Australian District Court to 10 offences including dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm and having a blood alcohol level exceeding 0.08. The court heard Cameron first bashed the 16-year-old sister of his ex-partner with a baseball bat. He had been looking for his ex-partner, the mother of his child, who was hiding from him. Cameron then drove away with his daughter in a stolen vehicle, the court heard. He later ignored a request from police to pull over and sped away without his headlights on before crashing into a concrete barrier. Cameron's daughter was treated for a ruptured bladder, cuts and bruises. His lawyer John Hawkins submitted that the case was 'almost something out of a novel or a Hollywood horror movie'. Mr Hawkins said his client didn't remember the events but accepted the facts based on what other people had witnessed. He said Cameron was appalled when he learned what had happened and hoped to one day be able to make it up to his daughter. Judge Gillian Braddock commented that Cameron was 'completely out of control' when he attacked the girl with a baseball bat. A grainy picture from the scene of the crash and the fire in Perth showing the car on fire . Cameron's daughter seen with family recovering after her ordeal . Cameron's lawyer said the case was like a 'Hollywood horror movie' and he was 'out of control' 'It would not have mattered who got in his way by sound of it,' she said. Judge Braddock said the house was full of children who would have been frightened by his violent rage. She said while Cameron's daughter suffered no long-term physical effects from the crash, she still had anxiety about fire and travelling in cars. 'You have frightened her in a way that will be long lasting, hopefully not permanent,' she said. She accepted that Cameron was deeply ashamed by what happened, but noted it was a very serious offence. He pleaded guilty at West Australian District Court to 10 offences including occasioning grievous bodily harm . She said he showed a total disregard for the safety of his child and other road users. The judge also noted that Cameron had a lengthy criminal record and had only been released from prison a few months before the incident after serving time for aggravated burglary. Cameron was also fined and disqualified from driving for a period. Outside court, Mr Hawkins said his client loved his daughter and wanted to express to his estranged family his sorrow and shame over his conduct.","Bevan Stanley Cameron was drunk when he crashed a stolen car in April .

Erik Pauze, head gardener for Rockefeller Center, said he found the tree a couple of years ago, but it wasn't quite ready. 'I came by every now and then, checked it out, and when they bought the house and they contacted me again I came by and it was perfect, it was ready to go,' Mr Pauze said. 'This tree is great.

"A man who paid out around £30,000 to the Child Support Agency (CSA) for a child he has proved is not his will not get his money back despite a promise that he would. The CSA wrote to him twice saying that if he could prove he was not the father of the girl then he would get a full refund. But now the 49-year-old has been told that even though he has provided a DNA test showing that he is not the father, he will not get a penny back. Scroll down for video . Steven Carter, 49, from Devon paid out around £50,000 to the Child Support Agency (CSA) for a child he has proved is not his will not get his money back despite a promise that he would . Mr Carter said that he will continue to fight to get back the money he has paid out on the girl who is now 22. A Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) spokesman said today: “If a person continues to make child support payments for year after year, the assumption has to be that they accept parentage. “When there is a dispute, then the onus is very much on the father to prompt action and have a paternity test, rather than pay and wait until the child is an adult. “Reimbursements can only be considered after a paternity test is taken.” A DWP source said a rebate would not be considered if the paternity test is taken after the child has become an adult and the case is closed. A DNA swab is taken: A private DNA test which took place in February 2014 and confirmed that Steven Carter was not the father . Mr Carter’s lawyer Kate Baker said: “I will continue to represent my client and take his complaint to the next stage.” Miss Baker said payments of £86.31p per week were deducted from his salary from June 2007 up until April 2014 when she got the payments stopped - a total of around £31,000. She added that there was a level of miscommunication between 2003 and 2013 between her client and the CSA because he does not understand letters he receives due to his dyslexia, which he told the CSA about. She said: “He has disputed parentage from the outset from 2003. He requested a DNA test by letter in April 2007. “We got involved in July 2013 and asked for a breakdown but we did not get one.” Miss Baker said her firm located the ‘child’ - now a young woman - and arranged a private DNA test which took place in February 2014 and confirmed that Steven Carter was not the father. The lawyer wrote three letters to the CSA asking for a refund as well as a breakdown of how much he had paid but ‘these letters were ignored’. Mr Carter, from Exeter, Devon, who runs a security company, suffers with dyslexia and because of this ‘would not a clue’ about the CSA procedures. He said: “The CSA say they set up two DNA tests but that is an absolute lie. And they knew I was dyslexic. I told them to speak to me on the phone, don’t send me letters. But I did keep all the paperwork which I gave to my solicitor.” And one CSA letter dated August 2013 from a general manager states: “As Mr Carter failed to attend the DNA the child support agency arranged for him, he will have to pay for a private DNA test. “If this shows that he is not the parent of the child then he will be refunded back any money he has made.” And a second letter written to his then MP, Tory Angela Browning, in September 2007, written by a complaints resolution officer, said: “Until the Agency receives a Declaration of Parentage confirming Mr Carter is not the father of the qualifying child, we will continue to request payments by deductions of earning order and maintain the case until such time as the case closes. “Should Mr Carter obtain a Declaration of Parentage showing he is not the father, any payments he has made will be refunded to him in full.” But in June 2014 his lawyer received another letter from the CSA which read: “As his DNA test proves he is not the father, a refund could be considered, but only for payments made against any charges for maintenance due from March 2014, when his test was taken, onwards. “However as his case was closed from September 2009 (when the girl ended full time education) there are no ongoing maintenance charges against which payments were made and a refund is therefore not possible. “Whilst I appreciate that Mr Carter will be disappointed, I trust I have explained the reason for our decision clearly.” The letter also admitted that the CSA continued to take money from Mr Carter’s salary after 2009 ‘in order to recover the outstanding balance of arrears’. The CSA admitted that since 2003 Mr Carter disputed he was the father of the girl - but he did not have the DNA test until 2014. He said: “I had a one-night stand with the mother of this girl, on two occasions. She was with a boyfriend at the time. “She obviously looked at me like a cash cow. It was a fling 23 years ago and the girl is now 22-years-old. “I work in a nightclub and the CSA contacted my employers and took my money. They accepted her word with no proof at all. “I always said she was not my child. It was basically a one night stand but I wore protection which I know is not 100% but from day one I knew she was not my child. “Now the Government seem to be penny pinching off me. I work all the hours I can every day and have not had a holiday in nine years.” Mr Carter, who has two grown up children who he has paid maintenance for, said he was shelling out £70 a week from his wages for the girl since 1995 - £35 a week plus another £35 a week in back pay. He took his case to a lawyer when the CSA demanded he pay another £8,000 back pay for the girl which would take another five years to clear. DNA strands enable scientists to tell with almost total certainty who is the father of a child. It can also tell who is not the father as was the case in Mr Carter's case . He said over the years he has made hundreds of phone calls to the CSA who told him to prove he was not the father. He said: “I could not afford a solicitor. But when I was told I had to pay another £8,000 back pay I got one because I had been hitting brick walls. “They have said in black and white that if I can prove I am not the father they will refund all the money. “I have had to borrow £20,000 from my father to keep going. Over the years the CSA has taken all my money. But I am not giving up on this. I don’t care what it costs. “I don’t know if the girl knows who her real dad is. I feel sorry for her but I have had no contact with her mother. “But whoever her biological father is has got away with it and not paid a penny.” Local Devon Tory MP Hugo Swire got involved but the CSA told him they would not be giving a refund. The case is now going to an Independent case examiner for a review. Mr Carter paid around £1,000 for the DNA test and is paying his legal fees which have added to his financial burden. Miss Baker said: “We have not been provided with any legislation from the CSA which justifies them withholding payment to our client.” Mr Carter has never met the girl at the centre of the row and has not seen her mother. He said: “I would not know the girl if she walked past me in the street.”","Girl was born from a one-night stand as the mother had a boyfriend already .

"Prolific: Nigella Lawson is continuously sharing pictures of meals out with followers on Twitter . It is a commonplace sight in Britain’s high-end restaurants. A customer, delighted with their meal, photographs their plate of food and posts it on Twitter. The snapshots are sometimes labelled ‘food porn’ by their aficionados. But far from enjoying the free publicity, agitated French chefs have pledged to ban cameras in their restaurants, claiming it is the height of bad manners and an infringement of their ‘intellectual property’. A group of top chefs have criticised diners for ruining the surprise for future diners and tipping off rivals about their food presentation. Chef Alexandre Gauthier, 34, who runs the Grenouillere restaurant in La Madelaine-sous-Montreuil, in northern France, said diners often appeared more interested in photographing their food than eating it. He has now introduced menus with a picture of a camera with a line through it to dissuade diners from posting photos of their food on social networking sites. He said: ‘They used to come and take pictures of themselves and their family, their grandmother, whoever, as a souvenir. 'Now they take pictures of the food, they put it on Facebook or Twitter, they comment. And then the food is cold.’ Mr Gauthier said he had seen customers rearrange tables in order to capture their food at the best angle, before setting off a stream of flashes from their camera. He added: ‘I would like people to be living in the present. Tweet about the meal beforehand, tweet about it afterwards, but in between stop and eat.’ Gilles Goujon, who runs a three Michelin-starred restaurant, L’Auberge du Vieux Puits, in Fontjoncouse, in southern France, said: ‘If people take a photo and put it out on social media, it takes away the surprise. Robin Lawley recently posed pictures of her meal to Instagram - a practice which French chefs are trying to ban . ‘It takes away a little bit of my intellectual property too. Someone could copy me. ‘Plus a photo taken on an average smartphone is rarely a great image. It doesn’t give the best impression of our work. It’s annoying.’ He complained that his signature dish ‘oeuf de poule pourri de truffles’, chicken egg laden with truffles, was now often pictured on social media. Mr Goujon said he wanted to ban the practice but did not want to appear rude himself. ‘It’s difficult to forbid it. I’m looking for a sentence to write but I haven’t yet found the right words that won’t be too shocking’, he said. Several restaurants in New York have already banned mobile phones for the same reason. Michel Roux Jr, head chef of the two Michelin-starred Le Gavroche in Mayfair, central London, has also previously criticised the practice. He said: ‘It should be flattering, but it annoys me when I see people taking photos of their food. ‘It’s disruptive for the people around them and it spoils that person’s enjoyment of the meal. Personally, I think it’s incredibly poor manners.’ One chef says he has seen diners move tables to take a picture, ruining the atmosphere for other diners . But it seems not all British chefs agree with their French counterparts. Nigella Lawson tweets pictures of her food non-stop, including when she is dining out. She previously took a photograph of herself at Scott’s in Mayfair, writing: ‘Lunchtime treat at Scott’s restaurant – oysters! 3 Cornish natives & 3 West Mersea natives. Glorious.’ Scott’s would later be the scene of her infamous contretemps with former husband Charles Saatchi. Meanwhile, rapper Professor Green tweeted pictures of each of the courses of his £195 meal at the Fat Duck while on a date with his now-wife, Millie Mackintosh. His wife also regularly tweets about her food and posted a photograph of a fish dish at 202 London, in Notting Hill, describing it as a ‘dream’. Television presenter Philip Schofield is also a fan of food tweets, and posted a photo himself eating the ‘sound of the sea’ from the tasting menu at Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, Berks, during a meal to celebrate his brother’s birthday.","Sharing pictures of food online is an established trend .

"It's fair to say that Friday is Grant Trebilco's favourite day of the week. Not because it's the end of the working week but because it's the day he can suit up in his fluro gear and head out into the surf. It may sound like fun and games but this is a project that the 33-year-old has been working on since March 2013 with a serious message behind it. When the avid surfer found out he had bipolar disorder two years ago, it was the waves of the ocean that helped him get through his condition. 'When I got myself out there into the surf, I was able to forget about everything,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Each wave would keep me going. Being in the ocean helped me get through it. So it took one wave to give me hope again.' This sparked the idea for Fluro Fridays - a weekly project which was established by OneWave, Mr Trebilco's non-proft surf community. It began in Mr Trebilco's beachside hometown Bondi, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, and since then other surfing communities across NSW have jumped on board. However this morning, October 10, marked a special day for the event. World Mental Health Day fell on a Friday and the OneWave community were keen to support and raise awareness for the cause. 'We had the biggest turn out today with over 200 people showing up at Bondi,' Mr Trebilco said. 'I can't believe how far it's [Fluro Fridays] come because I started it just hoping that we could help people and introduce them to surfing as a way of coping.' He says participants dressed in fluro, like every other Friday, but this time they held hands and stood along the shoreline to create a wave. They then held a minute silence for those who had lost their battle with mental illness. 'All we want to do is start a critical conversation and help others to beat mental health,' Mr Trebilco said.

Nicola Wright and her boyfriend Lee Makin made up half of a destructive group of robbers who stormed homes and businesses across the North. The 39-year-old mother-of-two, who acted as the gang's getaway driver, was jailed alongside her 30-year-old partner and his accomplices after CCTV footage of them dressed in balaclavas and yielding knives against members of the public in Leigh and Warrington emerged. Scroll down for video . Nicola Wright, 39, and her boyfriend Lee Makin, 30, were part of a gang of armed robbers who raided shops and businesses across Leigh and Warrington . Accomplices Lee Harper (left) and Daniel Atherton (right) were jailed for eight and seven years respectively after admitting conspiracy to rob and burgle . The couple were arrested following a high-speed police chase . Together they had carried out almost 40 burglaries and raids between May and July last year. After being pursued by police cars and helicopters, the group were arrested on July 18 and jailed at Liverpool Crown Court this month. The court heard how Wright drove Makin and his accomplices, Daniel Atherton, 28, and Lee Harper, 34, away from dozens of houses and businesses raided as part of the group's spree in a saloon car. Dramatic footage obtained by Greater Manchester Police shows the gang, dressed in balaclavas and masks, smashing shop fronts with axes and waving knives in the faces of innocent bystanders as they steal an estimated £94,000 worth of property. Makin, from Leigh was jailed for seven years after admitting conspiracy to rob and burgle while Wright will spend two years behind bars for conspiracy to burgle. Harper received an eight year sentence while Atherton was also jailed for seven years. Detective Constable Lynsey Watson of Greater Manchester Police described the 'devastation' caused by the group. 'It is no exaggeration to that say that these four terrorised the Leigh and Warrington areas over a period of several weeks. 'Collectively they conspired to commit serious acquisitive crime for their own ends and did not at any point give a second thought to the trail of devastation they left behind. 'They targeted businesses and homes indiscriminately, moving from shops to garages to an amusement arcade. 'Even a letting agent wasn't outside their remit, proving just how arbitrary their offending was. The gang stormed businesses including letting agents across Leigh and Warrington wielding knives and axes . Wearing masks, hats and balaclavas they 'terorrised' members of the public and office workers with their raids . Among the gangs targets with letting agents and other businesses though they are thought to have also robbed homes . CCTV footage shows one of the gang members escaping through a broken-in door at a shop after plundering its till .

Greater Manchester Police said they terrorised dozens of workers across Leigh and Warrington with their crimes . One of the men rests his axe on the counter of  a shop while a second gang member searches cupboards behind the till . The group were arrested while driving in tandem as Greater Manchester Police helicopters and cars followed . 'A lot of time and effort went into identifying this gang and bringing them to justice and I would like to thank everyone who has been involved for helping us get to this point today. 'We have secured lengthy sentences against a dangerous gang of organised criminals who do not shy away from serious offending and this result is great news for everyone, particularly the residents and business community of Wigan and Warrington.'","Nicola Wright was a getaway driver for robber boyfriend Lee Makin .

"On trial: Renata Sode, 26, is accused of shaking a three-month-old baby so hard it became brain damaged - then delayed getting medical help . A Lithuanian woman shook a three month-old boy so hard he suffered brain damage and then waited 12 hours before calling an ambulance, a court has heard. Renata Sode, 26, also carried out internet searches for 'baby in coma' and 'baby having difficulty breathing' after attacking the child in September 2012, a jury was told. Doctors at  Queen's Hospital in Romford, Essex, first believed the baby, who cannot be named, might be suffering from a viral infection before becoming suspicious at his injuries, it is alleged. The little boy was described as 'grunting' as he tried to fill its lungs. His fontanelle, the soft area of a baby's skull, was raised and swollen, indicating bleeding of the brain, Snaresbrook Crown Court was told. His condition was so serious that he was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at King's College Hospital, London. Further tests revealed he had very little brain activity and was likely to have suffered brain damage. The boy also had extensive bleeding in his eyes and  bruising on his abdomen, the court heard. Sally Howes QC, prosecuting, said: 'What caused [the baby] to become so very unwell? The crown say that the subdural bleeding was the result of traumatic injury caused by being shaken or a mechanism involving some kind of shaking. 'The prosecution say it was deliberate injury caused by shaking. The defence say some other medical condition can't be ruled out.' Miss Howes continued: 'Who caused these injuries? It's the crown's case that they were caused by Renata Sode and, knowing and appreciating what she had done, she didn't contact emergency services for the best part of 12 hours. 'Having watched what she had done to him she watched him deteriorate - she finally called for an ambulance.' Her partner, Mindaugas Sodys, 31, is also accused of failing to provide medical assistance when the baby fell ill. The Lithuanian couple told doctors they had given mouth to mouth to the baby when it stopped breathing a few hours before the emergency call. Sode said she hadn't called an ambulance sooner because his condition had seemed to be improving. Pic shows Sode and partner Mindaugas Sodys, who is on trial for one count of cruelty to a person under 16 and one  of causing or allowing a child to suffer physical harm . Shocking: Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that the little boy had bleeding on the brain and was brain damaged . An analysis of Sode's phone showed that she had searched terms including 'baby in coma', 'baby is pale', 'baby having difficulty breathing' and 'London Ambulance Service' several hours before raising the alarm, the court heard. Sode, of Rainham, Essex, denies one counts of cruelty to a person under 16, one count of GBH, two counts of assault occasioning ABH and one count of causing or allowing a child to suffer physical harm. Sodys, of the same address, denies one count of cruelty to a person under 16 and one could of causing or allowing a child to suffer physical harm. The trial continues.

"A daughter who lived the life of a party animal was spurred into losing more than eight stone and six dress sizes after her mother died of liver cancer. Sara-Jayne Foreman, who at her largest was a size 20, put her expanding figure out of her head as she enjoyed boozy nights out with her friends, until her tee-total mother Gillian was diagnosed with the terminal illness. The 26-year-old swapped a diet of takeaways for fresh fruit and vegetables, and a variety of home-cooked meals to see her figure drop to a svelte size eight. Stunning transformation: Sara-Jayne Foreman swapped a diet of takeaways for . fresh fruit and vegetables, and a variety of home-cooked meals to see . her figure drop to a svelte size eight from size 20 . Sara-Jayne said: 'When I found out mum had cancer I was devastated. 'It didn't make any sense - she never drank, she never smoked and everything she ate was really healthy. 'Her cupboards were full of fresh food and she didn't have any junk.' Despite being a slim size 12 while at school, Sara-Jayne began eating unhealthy when she left, and stopped being active. Sara has dropped from 18st 6 and a size 20 (right) to just 10st 3 and a size 8 in just two years after being spurred to change her unhealthy lifestyle following her mothers diagnosis and death . Sara Jayne, with her mother Gillian (front right), father Garry Foreman and sister Sophie Rose . The hairdresser said: 'I was on the go all the time while I was still at school, but then I lost it and started eating loads of rubbish and going out all the time. 'The weight began to creep on, but I pushed it out of my mind and started eating loads of takeaways. 'I was living with my dad and his . portion sizes were huge. His work patterns were different to mine so I . was having four takeaways a week as well as McDonalds and KFC for lunch. 'I would eat Chinese, Indian and Pizza over three nights and then whichever I had preferred, I would have on the fourth night. 'I noticed I was going up in dress sizes but I didn't think I was that big.' Sara Jayne, who was a size 20 at this time lived the life of a party animal and her diet consisted largely of takeaways and alcohol . Sara-Jayne's party lifestyle meant the weight piled on and before she knew it, she weighed more than 18 stone. Gillian Foreman wad diagnosed with terminal liver cancer at age 56 . 'When I started going out, I noticed I looked massive,' she said.' 'I just tried to be a party animal and be like anyone else to put it out of my head. 'I couldn't fit into fashionable clothes so I would run into shops like Evans and just buy anything that fit. 'If I went into Topshop I would buy the clothes that are meant to be oversized, but on me, they were fitted.' But when Gillian, 56, became unwell, Sara-Jayne was forced to face up to her own health. Sara-Jayne, from Pontefract, Yorkshire, said: 'It was my worst nightmare and totally out of the blue. 'It was a big strain on the whole family. We spent nine months by her side before she died, we just wanted to spend as much time with her as possible. 'I thought about how short life was, and when she passed away I decided I needed to sort my life out.' Sara-Jayne joined Weight Watchers with her auntie Janet, tipping the scales at 18 stone 6. After just two months, she had already lost 2.5 stone. She said: 'I felt like a completely different person. I didn't think I was that big but when I look back at pictures I think I looked massive. Sara says that the devastating loss of her mother changed her perspective and realise life is short and made her reassess her own health and lifestyle choices . 'Going down a dress size or preparing for a holiday spurred me on to keep going and I changed my whole lifestyle.' In less than two years, Sara-Jayne has lost more than EIGHT stone, and now weighs in at an incredible 10 stone 3. 'I feel great and I love creating new recipes with fresh food. 'I have gone to eat the stuff that I used to but I don't like it anymore. 'Losing my mum spurred me on because it made me see things in a totally different perspective.

"Justice minister Andrew Selous said the disabled often worked harder because they were 'grateful' to have a job . A Tory minster has claimed disabled people are often harder grafters because they are 'grateful' to be in work. Justice minister Andrew Selous made the remarks at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham earlier this month. The revelation comes just days after David Cameron faced calls to sack welfare minister Lord Freud after he claimed some disabled people were 'not worth' the minimum wage. Mr Selous, a former parliamentary aide to Welfare Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, told a fringe meeting on social justice - that in his experience the disabled often made excellent employees. According to the Independent on Sunday he said: 'Disabled people work harder because they're grateful to have a job.' Dave Adams, of the Napo probation union, said he was 'shocked' by Mr Selous' remarks. He said: 'It was one of those moments where you think 'did he really just say that?'.' Mr Selous defended his position last night. He said: 'I was Iain Duncan Smith's PPS [Parliamentary Private Secretary] for four years. 'My recollection is that the point I was making was the feedback I had... that employers are often very, very pleased with disabled employees; they work harder, they are loyal. These are good reasons to employ disabled people and offenders.' But Labour's shadow disabilities minister Kate Green said: 'These new comments about disabled people from another Tory minister show they just don't get it. 'Many would love to work, but Tory policies are failing disabled people.' The party's shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves told the Independent on Sunday that Labour would be tabling a motion of no confidence in Lord Freud next week. She said: 'David Cameron's failure to act after Lord Freud said that some disabled people are 'not worth the full wage' is astonishing... it's clear the mask has slipped and the nasty party is back. 'Labour will table a motion of no confidence in Lord Freud because we believe it's completely unacceptable that David Cameron has failed to sack his minister for Welfare Reform.' Labour will table the no-confidence motion tomorrow and the vote will be on October 29. Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith, 60, took part in the annual 10km Swanbourne Endeavour Endurance Event in support of his wife Betsey's special charity, Medical Detection Dogs . The Cabinet minister has faced calls to sack his welfare minister Lord Freud this week over his comments about the disabled . Welfare minister Lord Freud said some disabled people were being stopped from working because they were 'not worth' the minimum wage . Lord Freud's remarks were revealed by Labour leader Ed Miliband during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. Mr Miliband ambushed the PM with a transcript of the minister's controversial remarks taken from a secret recording. Lord Freud was forced to issue a grovelling apology following the Commons bust up, but Labour have pushed for him to be sacked. Shadow cabinet minister Angela Eagle said: 'I do think he should resign. I think what he said… has caused a great deal of offence to disabled people. 'There are 50 per cent of people with disabilities who are not in work at the moment. The answer to that isn't to somehow weaken the minimum wage and make them work for less than the minimum wage.' Labour shadow minister Angela Eagle was criticised on Question Time for attacking Lord Freud's remarks . But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was clear Lord Freud had been talking about the state 'topping up' the incomes of disabled people. Lord Freud comments came in response to a councillor with a severely disabled daughter who suggested that people with mental health problems may be unable to work because employers are unwilling to pay them the statutory minimum. He suggested that some disabled workers were 'not worth' the £6.50 minimum wage and were therefore locked out of work.","Justice minister Andrew Selous made the remarks at the Tory conference .

"Silvio Berlusconi has labelled judges who ordered him to pay his ex-wife £29 million a year in a divorce settlement as 'feminists and communists'. The 74-year-old lashed out during a TV interview in his first public comments on the decision which emerged last month. The ruling works out at £82,000 a day, four times the average annual salary for an ordinary Italian but small change to Mr Berlusconi, who has a personal fortune of more than £5 billion. Divorce settlement: Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi, right, has been ordered to pay his ex-wife Veronica Lario, left, £29 million a year . Asked about the Milan court’s ruling, the former PM who is planing a political comeback at the general election next month said: ‘That figure was decided on by three feminist and communist judges. It’s something unreal.’ The ruling said the money would allow Veronica Lario, the mother of Mr Berlusconi’s three children, to 'live in the manner that she was accustomed to during her marriage' and it also noted she was 'without a home as part of the settlement'. Miss Lario began proceedings against Mr . Berlusconi three years ago after it emerged he had attended the 18th . birthday party of lingerie model Noemi Letizia. The revelation sparked fury from his then wife who accused him of never attending birthday parties of their own children. Scathing attack: The former Italian Prime Minister labelled the judges who made the 'unreal' decision 'feminists and communists' Outspoken: Former Premier Silvio Berlusconi gestures as he is interviewed about the divorce settlement today . As a result, she said that she could 'no longer live with a man who associates with minors' and she instructed lawyers to begin divorce proceedings against her husband. However Mr Berlusconi added in his TV interview that he hoped 'to sort things out amicably with Veronica' as they were still on good terms. However, the judges hit back yesterday. In a statement, senior judges criticised him for his ‘mocking’ of the judiciary. In October he was convicted of tax fraud and given a four year sentence which was later reduced to one year but he is appealing this verdict as well and he is also currently on trial accused of having sex with an underage prostitute and abuse of office.","Former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi has three children with Veronica Lario .

"A Northern California woman and her boyfriend were arrested on Sunday on suspicion of murder in her three-year-old daughter's death after someone recognized the wanted couple at a restaurant and tipped off authorities. Sara Krueger, 23, and Scott Warner, 26, became subjects of an intense search in the San Francisco Bay Area after officers conducting a welfare check at Krueger's Napa apartment found the child's body in her bed on Saturday, Lt. Debbie Peecook said. A few hours earlier, witnesses had seen Krueger and Warner leaving the apartment with luggage, police said. Sara Krueger, 23, and Scott Warner, 26, became subjects of an intense search in the San Francisco Bay Area after officers conducting a welfare check at Krueger's Napa apartment found the child's body in her bed . Victim: Krueger's 3-year-old daughter (pictured) was found beaten and sexually assaulted in her bed . Someone who spotted the couple at a restaurant near a Bay Area Rapid Transit station on Sunday in the city of El Cerrito alerted police, and BART officers detained them, Peecook said. BART police Lt. Gil Lopez said they were detained without incident at the station in El Cerrito, about 30 miles south of Napa. They were questioned and booked on suspicion of murder with special circumstances and assault on a child resulting in death. Peecook said she didn't know whether they have retained an attorney. The child, whose name was not released, showed signs of having been sexually assaulted and blunt force trauma, investigators said. Her biological father, who is serving time at San Quentin State Prison, was notified of her death. Neighbors said that the home had been the scene of multiple disturbances since Kreuger's boyfriend 26-year-old Scott Warner moved in . The property manager at Krueger's apartment building told the Napa Valley Register . that in recent months, police visited the mother's residence for . several disturbances, including late-night noise, slamming doors and . neighbors reporting possible physical abuse of the child. Warner 'moved in about 10 months ago, and it all went downhill from there,' Elizabeth Chechourka said.

"He toiled day and night in icy streams around the mountains of Scotland. John Greenwood was searching for gold with one aim in mind – to make engagement and wedding rings for his sweetheart from the thousands of tiny specks of precious metal he was collecting. It was a pure labour of love. And today, as he returned with his delighted new bride from a Caribbean marriage ceremony, it was clear it had all panned out okay. John and Morag pictured after having exchanged their special rings at their Antigua wedding . Morag's engagement ring (pictured), like the wedding bands, was hallmarked simply as 'Scottish gold' because gold from there is so rare . In total John spent over 18 months painstakingly panning for tiny flecks of gold in the hills . Mr Greenwood and Morag Shearer tied the knot when the explosives technician slipped a beautifully crafted band on his fiancee’s finger, and she put a matching ring on his. Yesterday the man with the Midas touch (not to mention a rare romantic streak) looked back on his time knee-deep in the upper reaches of Highland rivers and declared: ‘I put a lot of effort into it . . . but it was worth it.’ Mr Greenwood wanted to pop the question with a unique ring. Not for him, however, the cheapskate trick of sawing off a piece of copper pipe, or popping to Argos. During three months from September 2011, equipped with just a trowel, shovel, rake and pan, he quietly went for gold – and emerged a winner. John needed to collect far more gold than was used in the finished ring, to allow the jeweller to melt and cast it . John only paid £500 for a jeweller to cast the collected gold into the designed rings . Gold experts say John must have the Midas touch, after he collected 34 grammes in a few months . He used a simple gold pan, trowel, shovel and rake to collect nuggets, flakes and tiny specks . The tiny separate amounts John had collected had to be melted together before being cast . ‘I was driven by it,’ the 48-year-old said. ‘They talk about gold fever – I was panning for gold in my dreams. Some days I’d be camping next to the river and I’d start as soon as the sun was up, and carry on for 14 or 15 hours. 'Everybody says I must have beginner’s luck to find so much but I was out there every weekend and in the evenings in freezing cold water. I reckon I spent about 20 full days getting enough for the engagement ring.’ By December, the Perthshire native had 34g of flakes, dust and the odd small nugget for Mull of Kintyre goldsmith Grant Logan to melt, shape and embed with diamonds. The gold has a purity of approximately 22+ carats and a significantly greater value than the gold market value thanks to its rarity. Morag wearing both her wedding and engagement rings and John in his wedding band . The following Christmas Day he surprised Miss Shearer, 42, with the ring. Then, it was back to the chilly waters of the River Tay and the Highland Boundary Fault. Over 18 months, he found almost 70g for wedding bands. Mr Logan told him: ‘A lot of people spend a lifetime panning in Scotland without finding enough for a ring.’ The rings cost a bargain £500. But to Miss Shearer, they are priceless. ‘I feel very proud of John and very lucky,’ the physiotherapist said. The bands were proudly engraved ‘Scottish Gold’, a provenance that will greatly increase their value. Gold from Scotland is relatively rare, and is not available commercially. Last Thursday, the intrepid prospector and his bride flew to Antigua to become Mr and Mrs Greenwood. ‘It was an amazing feeling to put the ring on her finger,’ he said. ‘I was really overwhelmed.’ It seems there IS gold in them there hills – and in Scotland, lucky prospectors have been reaping its rewards for centuries. The first known discovery was made in 1239. In 1818, a single large nugget found in Sutherland was made into a ring, still owned by the local Duke’s family. Today some holiday firms offer prospecting holidays, but few strike it rich. A specialist website shows nuggets totalling 200g – the result of five years’ panning. However, Scottish gold is very pure, at least 22 carats. Totally pure gold is rated 24-carat. In this form, it is very soft, so most good quality jewellery is made from tougher 18-carat gold. Regular 22-carat gold is valued at £20 to £22 per gram at current prices – making the flakes and nuggets Mr Greenwood found worth well over £2,000. Not all of his haul went into the rings themselves. A certain amount of excess raw material was needed so jeweller Mr Logan could cast them successfully. The pair exchanged rings in a dream wedding on the paradise island of Antigua, in the West Indies . The couple wed in Antigua on Thursday 25 September with a small group of family members and are returning to Scotland today .","John spent hours over months panning for tiny specks of gold .

"Hiring in U.S. firms might be strong, but don't expect a pay raise anytime soon, says a new study. Only 24 per cent of companies increased employees' wages and salaries in the July-September quarter, a survey by the National Association for Business Economics found. This is compared to a much higher 43 per cent in the April-June quarter. The drop, the first after three straight increases, could be a sign that wage gains may remain weak in coming months. It comes as U.S firms continue to hire employees at a healthy pace, which usually pushes wages higher as employers compete for workers. A measure of hiring remained near a three-year high. Don't get your hopes up: U.S. firms were much less likely to boost pay in the third quarter than in previous quarters, a study has found. It fell to just 24 per cent in July-September . Strong hiring: U.S firms continue to hire employees at a healthy pace, which usually pushes wages higher as employers compete for workers. A measure of hiring remained near a three-year high . However, the figures suggest that the number of people out of work remains high enough that companies are not under any pressure to raise pay. Despite healthy job gains this year, there were still 9.3 million people unemployed in September, according to government data. That's up from 7.6 million before the Great Recession. More than seven million Americans are working part-time but are looking for full-time work, which gives employers an even larger pool of potential employees to choose from. The NABE surveyed 76 of its member economists in late September. The economists work for companies or private trade associations. The survey revealed that just one-third of workers believe their companies will boost their wages in the October-December quarter, around the same proportion as three months ago. Weaker sales and profits may have also made companies reluctant to boost pay. Just 49 percent of respondents said their company's sales rose in the third quarter, the smallest proportion in a year. Out of work: The figures suggest that the number of people out of work remains high enough that companies are not under any pressure to raise pay. Above, a file image of man filling in a job application . Profits also were squeezed, with 14 percent of firms reporting smaller profit margins. That was the largest proportion to do so in a year. The study also found that the economists were only modestly concerned about slower growth in Europe. Only 7 percent of firms said a slowdown there would have a significant negative effect. Forty four percent said it would have a minor negative effect, 46 percent said it would have no impact and just 3 percent said it would have a minor positive effect. Still, the survey was conducted before weak economic data from the region caused sharp drops in U.S. stock markets in the past two weeks. Searching for a job: Despite healthy job gains this year, there were still 9.3 million people unemployed in September, according to government data. That's up from 7.6 million before the Great Recession (file image) Meanwhile, more than three-quarters of the economists surveyed said they expected the Federal Reserve to begin raising its benchmark short-term interest rate in the second quarter of 2015. But 84 percent said a small increase in rates in the short-term wouldn't hurt their businesses. And two-thirds of the firms said they were having no difficulty filling their open jobs, a good sign for hiring. Government data shows that job openings are at the highest level in nearly 14 years. Some economists worry that many of the unemployed don't have the skills needed for the jobs that are available. But the NABE survey suggests that companies are mostly able to fill available jobs. This is also another likely reason why wages increases are becoming less common; if companies were having more difficulty hiring workers, they might offer higher salaries.","Only 24 per cent of U.S. firms gave workers pay raises July-September .

"The wife at the center of a nasty divorce with her investment banker husband who makes $7 million a year at Jefferies and Company in New York City is not just revealing the details of their now very public sex life in court documents, but also her and her husband's rampant drug use. In an affidavit filed by Christina Di Mauro Kelly, she describes the last 12 years of marriage with her husband Sage as a nonstop drugfest, complete with cocaine, heroin, Molly, Ketamine, ecstasy and a whole lot of alcohol. In fact, she claims her husband's drug use was so frequent, he had a special high end drug dealer who only worked with clients purchasing 'substantial quantities of illegal drugs.' Bitter divorce: Christina Di Mauro Kelly (left) is making some very big claims about her soon to be ex-husband Sage's (right) rampant drug use in court documents . Children's welfare: Christina claims she and her husband did drugs while their children were present in their apartment in the city and their Hamptons vacation home . Christina says her husband kept cocaine and Molly around both their Manhattan apartment and Sag Harbor house at all times, with both parties using while their children, ages 10 and 6, were home, and with Sage storing the drugs in 'bags' or 'squirt bottles designed and manufactured to contain a nasal spray.' That's not all her snorted either according to Christina, who recalls one time when her husband snorted heroin at a club in the Hamptons while they were dating. She says afterwards he became 'disoriented' and then tried to walk home 'barefoot.' Soon he moved on to other drugs claims Christina, among them Ketamine and mushrooms. He had a ""magic mushroom party"" at their house in Sag Harbor in 2011, and consumed so many of the hallucinogenics that she says they hid the bag from him. That did not stop him however according to Christina. She says in court papers, 'We were all stunned, therefore, at the sight of Sage– with his own blood purposefully smeared on his face in several long lines– walking towards us outside the home. 'After exclaiming, ""I found the bag!,"" Sage popped yet another mushroom into his mouth.' Acrimonious divorce: The couple are seen leaving a Manhattan courthouse separately earlier this week . Then there was the time he did Ketamine and, again according to Christina, demanded to hold their daughter for several hours after getting depressed and going in to a K-hole. She says Sage 'desperately clung to [then 3-year-old daughter] Cameron for several hours, causing Cameron to have palpable feelings of fear for her father's well-being.' She also provided the court with photos that claim to show a giant mound of cocaine he consumed with a friend and Sage showing off a vial of cocaine during a party they had at their apartment while their daughters were home. Party buds: Christina says the couple did cocaine with Sloane Angell (left) and Mark Hosny (right), . Denying claims: Sage has said of these claims, 'While [she] and I used recreational drugs on occasion at certain social events in the past, the Wolf of Wall Street tale she tells this court is a work of fiction' One of her last claims is a wild trip Sage took to Las Vegas to celebrate the 'Bachelor Party' of Mark Hosny, a weekend that she seems to imply was filled with drugs, booze and hookers. 'In May 2014, defendant and several of Defendant's drug cohorts engaged in a several-day, illegal ""drugfest"" in Las Vegas, Nevada in which they ingested various illegal substances, notably cocaine, and engaged in numerous forms of wild behavior, including but not limited to, engagement in sexual relations with prostitutes,' the papers claim. She also names a host of men who also did cocaine and other drugs with her husband, from younger men about town in NYC to big name execs and bankers. Mr Kelly said in paper filed this summer of his soon to be ex-wife's claims, 'While [she] and I used recreational drugs on occasion at certain social events in the past, the Wolf of Wall Street tale she tells this court is a work of fiction.' Christina says she is now sober, attending meetings on a daily basis, and is dedicated to getting clean.","In a court affidavit filed in her divorce proceedings, Christina Di Mauro Kelly reveals her and her investment banker husband Sage's rampant drug use .

"Sainsbury's and Asda will let shoppers pay for groceries with the Zapp mobile payments app (pictured) from 2015 . UK shoppers will be able leave their wallets at home when doing the supermarket shop in the future, after Sainsbury’s and Asda joined a number of companies allowing customers to pay with their smartphones. The two supermarkets will let shoppers pay for groceries with the Zapp mobile payments app from 2015. Zapp was announced in January, and HSBC, First Direct, Nationwide, Santander and Metro Bank have already signed up to offer Zapp mobile payments to 18 million customers across the UK. Now a new tranche of companies including House of Fraser Shop Direct, Thomas Cook, Clarks and Oxfam have pledged to let their customers use Zapp to pay. The company says the retailers' commitment is proof that the mobile payment revolution is at last taking off and will deliver improvements in security, convenience and speed, while ‘checking out’ both online and in-store. Consumers should be able to start using the app next year on iOS, Android and Windows Phone handsets. It will be rolled out gradually and customers will be alerted by their banks when it becomes available. Zapp will be integrated into a mobile banking application. Bank customers will be able to see their balances on each account, and choose which one to pay from. When customers reach the checkout of a shop that accepts Zapp payments, they will have a special code sent to their mobile phone. Alternatively, customers will be able to scan a code into the handset from a bill in a restaurant or the screen on a card machine. The code will contain all the information about the transaction including the price, the retailer's details and information about the items being purchased. These will appear on the customer's mobile screen. Zapp will be integrated into a mobile banking application. Bank customers will be able to see their balances on each account, and choose which one to pay from. When customers reach the checkout of a shop (stock image) that accepts Zapp payments, they will have a special code sent to their mobile phone . Once a customer has then logged into the mobile banking app they will then confirm or reject the transaction with a tap of the finger. Zapp claims the whole process will take about 12 seconds. The group of retailers and payment providers will roll out Zapp to more than 35 million people and represents the largest coalition of retailer support for a new payment method to be announced in the UK. Zapp will compete with other payment systems when it launches, such as PayPal and Apple Pay – the forthcoming wallet service from Apple that is embedded in iPhones and the Apple Watch. At the moment, Apple Watch is only launching in the US next year and a global launch date has not yet been announced. Rob Harper, Head of Retail Services at PayPal UK, said the well-established payment service handled $27 billion in mobile payments globally in 2013 both online and on the high street. 'PayPal has been accepted on the British high street for over three years. You can use PayPal’s smartphone app to pay at over 2,000 UK high street shops and restaurants, including GBK, Prezzo and wagamama alongside the likes of Oasis, Coast and JD Sports. 'The PayPal app is more than a replacement for your wallet – not only can you shop on the high street but you can use it to check your spending, send money to a friend, order ahead for food or pay the bill at your table as well as take advantage of special offers at retailers,' he added. Barclays launched a payment app called Pingit in 2012 and since then it has been downloaded 3.2 million times and responsible for £680 million of transfers, demonstrating demand for an alternative way to make payments. According to the Centre for Economic and Business Research (Cebr) 20 million adults will use their mobiles to pay for goods and services by the end of the decade, with the value of purchases tripling from current levels to £14.2bn ($22.8bn) in 2018. Once a customer has then logged into the mobile banking app they will then confirm or reject the transaction with a tap of the finger (illustrated) . Zapp claims the whole process will take about 12 seconds . The service will be integrated onto a mobile banking application. The customers will be able to see their balances on each account, and choose which one to pay from. When customers reach the checkout of a shop that accepts Zapp payments, they will have a special code sent to their mobile phone. They will then confirm the transaction with a tap of the finger. The payments work through something known as ‘digital tokens’ which means customers can keep their financial details private. Banks claim the technology will be safer than using a debit card, as the unique code for that purchase will expire after three minutes. Unlike chip and pin cards, Zapp will never hand over sensitive information, such as card numbers and expiry dates. As well as this, only retailers signed up to the scheme will be able to generate the codes. Zapp claims its app will be the biggest change in mobile payments since the introduction of the Switch card in 1988. It will be simple for customers to use and there will be no long card numbers, new passwords and usernames to remember. They will be able to pay for goods and services with their existing bank account, a smartphone and a mobile banking app. Customers will be able to see their account balances at the point of purchase and choose different accounts to pay from, thereby staying more in control of their finances. Paying with Zapp will be more secure and simple than existing methods, the company claims, because customers won’t have to reveal any of their financial details to retailers when they are shopping. The payments system is also set to make life easier for retailers through real-time payments which will improve their cash flow. Zapp transactions will be a fraction of the cost of cards or other alternative payment methods. Jon Rudoe, Digital and Technology Director at Sainsbury’s, said: ‘We know that the way that our customers shop is changing and we’re always looking at new and innovative ways to improve the experience. ‘We’re one of the first retailers to sign up to Zapp to give our customers a quick, secure and convenient option to pay – both online and at the till.’ Paul Fielding, Group Treasurer of Asda said: ‘Zapp supports our long standing commitment to innovation. Our customers want to have choice, not only of what they buy but how they buy it, and Zapp will represent a fantastic addition to our payment options.’ Zapp transactions will be a fraction of the cost of cards or other alternative payment methods to make life easier for retailers. Both Sainsbury's and Tesco say they are pleased to be one of the first retailers to offer an alternative way to pay .","Two supermarkets will let shoppers pay with the Zapp app at their checkouts when it launches next year - although there is no exact date .
