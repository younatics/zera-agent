"(CNN) -- Flamboyant carnival musician Michel Martelly edged out former Haitian first lady Mirlande Manigat in a pivotal presidential runoff vote held last month, according to preliminary results released Monday. Martelly, 50, took 67.6% of the vote, while Manigat, 70, received 31.5%, according to Pierre Thibault, spokesman for Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council. After the announcement, streets around the electoral council in Petionville filled with Martelly's spirited supporters, who chanted ""Tete Kale,"" or bald head -- one of Martelly's many nicknames. The preliminary results were originally expected to be announced last week, but fraud forced the council to delay the announcement until Monday. Final results are scheduled to be announced April 16. Martelly made a name for himself as the singer ""Sweet Mickey,"" who sometimes drank rum straight from a bottle and ripped his clothes off during performances. But he shed his bad-boy image off-stage to take care of his family and educate his children. ""My life on stage was very different than it was at home,"" Martelly said last year in the midst of violence after the November election. In early December, the electoral council announced that Manigat had won but lacked the majority of votes needed for an outright victory. Initial results put her in a runoff with government-backed candidate Jude Celestin. Haitians responded by charging fraud and burning cars, tires and Celestin's campaign headquarters in Port-au-Prince. The third-place candidate, Martelly, claimed he had won more votes than Celestin and a review of results by an Organization of American States team supported that contention. The runoff vote was held March 20 and unfolded peacefully for the most part amid concerns that the return of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a polarizing figure in Haiti, would disrupt the vote. Aristide arrived in Haiti two days before the runoff but has kept a low profile so far and did not endorse a candidate. If the preliminary results stand, Martelly will inherit a job laden with challenges as the impoverished country struggles to rebuild after last year's devastating earthquake and a cholera epidemic. Martelly said in December that Haiti will go nowhere unless the people have a president they can trust, a president who is honest. ""I've been on the ground with them for 22 years,"" he said of his musical career. ""The people know me. I represent the light at the end of the tunnel.""

"Kenyan counterterrorism sources are looking at a Norwegian citizen of Somali descent as a possible suspect in the Westgate mall attack last month, the sources told CNN on Friday. The Norwegian citizen is believed to have ties to Mohamed Abdikadir Mohamed, known as Ikrima, who is regarded as one of the most dangerous commanders in the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab. Norwegian intelligence services are in Kenya investigating Ikrima and the Norwegian citizen, the Kenyan sources said, and have also spoken to the latter's sister in Norway. Norwegian authorities have not yet released the Norwegian citizen's name. Kenyan authorities suspect Ikrima of involvement with the Westgate mall attack. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the bloody four-day siege at the upscale mall in Nairobi, where at least 67 people died. U.S. officials said Ikrima was the target of a raid earlier this month by U.S. Navy SEALs on an Al-Shabaab compound near the town of Baraawe in Somalia. It's believed that he escaped after the U.S. troops came under heavy fire. A Kenyan intelligence dossier seen by CNN alleges Ikrima's involvement with Briton Samantha Lewthwaite, a terror suspect known as the ""White Widow,"" in a foiled Mombasa attack in 2011 with Jermaine Grant, a fellow British citizen currently held in Mombasa on terror charges. Kenyan intelligence sources say that Ikrima, who speaks six languages and grew up in Kenya, is the main ""point person"" between al Qaeda in Somalia and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and that he has helped pinpoint Kenyan targets. Recruiting operatives in the West? Morten Storm, a former informant who has worked for several Western intelligence agencies, has told CNN that he developed a close relationship with an Al-Shabaab figure called Ikrima between 2008 and 2012. He said he is confident that it's the same person who was targeted by U.S. forces. Inside story on an Al-Shabaab commander . Storm, who is Danish, described Ikrima as a Somali-Kenyan Al-Shabaab operative who had spent time in Norway. He said that Ikrima made clear to him via e-mail that he was ready to send recruits from the West back home from Somalia to launch attacks. Norwegian journalist Bent Skjaerstad told CNN his sources have confirmed that Ikrima had indeed spent time in Norway and had tried to recruit for Al-Shabaab in Europe. Skjaerstad, who reports on security and terrorism for TV2, said Ikrima had lived there between 2004 and 2008. He had failed to gain asylum status but had been given Norwegian travel papers. Skjaerstad told CNN that according to his sources, Ikrima had traveled to Somalia while living in Norway and had used about a dozen aliases. Friends of Ikrima who knew him from his time growing up on the Nairobi suburb of Eastleigh told CNN he traveled to Norway in 2003 and grew increasingly radicalized there. The sources, who had kept up with him over the years, said Ikrima traveled in 2007 to London, where they lost contact with him. In 2008 they heard that he was in Somalia, where he has been based since. Arabic is among the six languages spoken by Ikrima, and he studied French for two years at the Alliance Francais in Nairobi, his friends say. Al-Shabaab in Norway . The possible involvement of the Norwegian citizen in the Westgate mall attack has highlighted concerns about the widening reach of the Al-Shabaab group outside Somali borders. Stig Hansen, a security expert based in Norway and author of the book ""Al-Shabaab in Somalia,"" told CNN that if the Norwegian suspect is who he believes him to be, he lived in a small town in Norway but had connections with a wider group, not all of Somali origin. He came to Norway at age 8 or 9 and stayed for a couple of years, during which time he gained Norwegian citizenship, Hansen said. He later returned to Somalia. Al-Shabaab became quite popular among some Somali community groups in Norway from 2007 to 2009, Hansen said, ""because they were wrongly seen as some kind of national resistance group."" Observers noticed contradictions between what the group said in its English- and Arabic-language messaging, he said, which contributed to ignorance within the diaspora about its real nature. ""But the terrorist attacks inside of Somalia made it easier for the wider ethnic Somali community to see that this was really a terrorist organization, and it distanced itself,"" he said, making it less popular now. However, this development brought its own problems, Hansen said, and not just in Norway. ""What you have to look out for, also in the United States and the United Kingdom and all these other Scandinavian countries, are these small, small networks that are in one sense detached also from the Somali community leaders -- radicalized groups of youths and radical preachers, sheikhs, that go traveling around the various countries to try to incite,"" he said. ""That's what we have to watch these days.""","A Norwegian citizen of Somali descent is investigated in the Kenya mall attack .

"Unmanned aerial vehicles aren't generally thought of as technology that improves lives; they're more readily associated with spying or attacking things. However a competition in the United Arab Emirates is trying to change all that. Last month, the government launched the Drones for Good Award, a two-part competition inviting local and international engineers alike to submit proposals for UAVs aimed at improving government services locally and bettering humanity worldwide. While the UAE has thrown itself into the manufacturing of military drones (at last year's Dubai Airshow, Abu Dhabi-based Adcom Systems had the largest selection of UAVs), the government is also hoping to lead the way in the implementation of machines meant for civilian use. ""Drones get a lot of bad publicity related to surveillance and military operations,"" admits Saif Al Aleeli, the project manager. ""But at the end of the day, they're only a tool of technology. Our message is that we can use it for the good of people all over the world. We've already seen a lot of potential for humanitarian uses."" The first phase of the competition, which comes with a $270,000 cash award, invites UAE residents to submit ideas that can be employed by the country's various government services (Al Aleeli envisions drones monitoring traffic and being the first responder at emergency scenes within the next five years). The competition is an extension of the UAE's ambition of becoming the first government to use UAVs to deliver government services. In February, Dubai announced it started testing drones to make lightweight deliveries -- namely official documents, like IDs and driver's licenses, and medication -- and would employ fingerprint technology to confirm the identities of recipients. The government also envisions drones acting as the first responder at accident scenes. The announcement was accompanied by the unveiling of a battery-operated drone model developed by Emirati engineers. ""I think it is a new stage of development, not only for the UAE, but for the world,"" the UAE's minister of cabinet affairs, Mohammed Al Gergawi, told CNNMoney earlier this year. ""Either you embrace this technology, or you resist it. If you resist it, then the gap between you and your competitor wouldn't be a year or two, it's going to be 500 years,"" he continued. The competition also has an international component, with higher stakes, and a heftier award  of $1m. International submissions aren't limited to government services. They just need to make the world a better place. ""Innovation doesn't have an address. It comes from different geographical areas, from R&D centers and from the poor guy in Africa trying to provide a service or feed a certain need with technology. We want to give a chance to everyone in this world to be part of this innovation exercise,"" says Al Aleeli.","The UAE launched the Drones for Good Award last month .

"Washington (CNN) -- One of two photojournalists killed in a 2007 attack by a U.S. helicopter gunship in Iraq was being rescued when the gunship's crew fired on the van to which he was being carried, according to footage posted online Monday. Reuters photographer Saeed Cmagh survived an initial strafing by the Apache gunship's 30 mm machine gun, but he apparently died when the gunship opened fire on people attempting to get him off the sidewalk where he lay, according to the video. The aerial footage was posted by the Web site WikiLeaks, which said the video remains classified and ""clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded Reuters employee and his rescuers."" WikiLeaks is a site that publishes anonymously submitted documents, video and other sensitive materials. Pentagon documents on the investigation (pdf) The gunship's crew requested and received permission to open fire on the van, which the crew believed was trying to evacuate wounded insurgents, the U.S. military later concluded. Chmagh's Reuters colleague, Namir Noor-Eldeen, also died in the July 2007 air strike in the New Baghdad district of the Iraqi capital. Noor-Eldeen appears to have been killed in the first round of strafing from the gunship. The U.S. investigation into the attack found that the helicopter gunship's crew mistook the journalists' cameras for weapons while seeking out insurgents who had been firing at American troops in the area. The fliers estimated they killed 12 to 15 Iraqis in the attack. ""This tragic incident was investigated at that time by the brigade involved and the investigation found that the forces involved were not aware of the presence of the two reporters, and that all evidence available supported the conclusion by those forces that they were engaging armed insurgents, and not civilians,"" Maj. Shawn Turner, a U.S. military spokesman, told CNN in a written statement Monday. The Army's 2007 report on the incident found the crew had ""neither reason nor probability to assume that neutral media personnel were embedded with enemy forces,"" according to a copy of the document released to CNN. ""We regret the loss of innocent life, but this incident was promptly investigated, and there was never any attempt to cover up any aspects of this engagement,"" Turner added. A total of 139 journalists, nearly 120 of them Iraqis, have been killed during the 7-year-old war, according to the Committee To Protect Journalists. Reuters said the deaths of Chmagh and Noor-Eldeen ""were tragic and emblematic of the extreme dangers that exist in covering war zones."" ""This footage is deeply disturbing and reminds us of what journalists in war zones undergo to bring us the news,"" Joel Simon, the group's executive director, said in a written statement. ""The video also confirms our long-held view that a thorough and transparent investigation into this incident is urgently needed."" And Reuters said the deaths of Chmagh and Noor-Eldeen ""were tragic and emblematic of the extreme dangers that exist in covering war zones."" ""We continue to work for journalist safety and call on all involved parties to recognise the important work that journalists do and the extreme danger that photographers and video journalists face in particular,"" David Schlesinger, the wire service's editor-in-chief, said in a statement released to CNN.

"(CNN)A nurse who was quarantined against her will in New Jersey after treating Ebola patients in West Africa will not obey officials' instructions to seclude herself at home in Maine, she and her lawyers said on the ""Today"" show and to the Bangor Daily News. The nurse, Kaci Hickox, returned to Maine on Monday after New Jersey authorities released her from a hospital tent where state officials kept her over the weekend as part of a new quarantine policy. She hired a lawyer and spoke out about her isolation and was then transported to Maine. She has twice tested negative for the virus. Maine officials have said that they would ask Hickox to quarantine herself at home until the passage of 21 days from her last possible contact with an Ebola patient -- and that they would make it involuntary if she resisted. ""Today"" show host Matt Lauer asked her on Wednesday if she planned to follow guidelines and finish that quarantine on November 10. ""I don't plan on sticking to the guidelines,"" she said. ""I remain appalled by these home quarantine policies that have been forced upon me."" That could set up a confrontation with Maine officials. Photos: Ebola patients in the U.S. A fight ahead? Maine officials are ""exploring all of our options"" to protect residents' health, Gov. Paul LePage said Wednesday after news of Hickox resisting a home quarantine. He did not name the nurse. In a written statement, the governor said she ""has been unwilling to follow the protocols set forth by the Maine CDC and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for medical workers who have been in contact with Ebola patients."" The statement didn't say which protocols she was resisting but added that LePage is seeking legal authority to enforce a quarantine. CNN's attempts to contact LePage's office weren't immediately successful. LePage has said the state would work with Hickox on a plan to isolate her for the 21-day period. One of Hickox's lawyers, Norm Siegel, told Lauer that officials had until Thursday to adjust their approach, and if they tried to physically apprehend Hickox after she once she stops obeying the quarantine, her legal team would take the matter to court. On Tuesday, the state's health commissioner -- without naming Hickox -- warned that the state would force the quarantine if she didn't isolate herself willingly. ""If an individual who came in direct contact with Ebola patients has returned to Maine and is not willing to avoid public contact and stay in their home voluntarily during the period they are at some risk, we will take additional measures and pursue appropriate authority to ensure they make no public contact,"" Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew told reporters Tuesday. ""I want to be sure everyone understands what quarantine means in this case,"" Mayhew said. ""Stating it plainly, what we are asking for is that individuals who had direct contact with Ebola patients stay in their home and avoid public contact until the 21 days for potential incubation has passed."" On CNN, Hickox attorney Steven Hyman said he thinks the next step is up to Maine. ""We had been attempting to work with them to try to find some kind of compromise here, but that has not been possible,"" he said. ""And I saw from their news conference last night that they intend to try to seek an order. We have received no paper, so at this point she is not under any restriction other than her own voluntary staying in the house today."" Hyman said that knowing for certain what could happen legally is unclear because ""we're treading in areas"" in which ""there's not a whole lot of case law."" However, he said, ""Society has a right to protect itself from legitimate issues of public health, but it can't do it based on what the (U.S.) Supreme Court calls fear."" The lawyer referred to the opinion of Dr. Amesh A. Adalja who also discussed the Hickox case on CNN on Wednesday, weighing in as an independent medical expert. He specializes in infectious disease and is a member of the U.S. government's National Disaster Medical System. Adalja said the nurse is not contagious if she is not having symptoms, and even if she were symptomatic, she would have to somehow pass along her bodily fluids to other people to infect them. He said he worried that some had ""forgotten"" established science about the virus. Lawyer: Nurse will follow CDC guidelines . Siegel told the Bangor newspaper that Hickox would contest any court order. But she will abide by guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that say she should subject herself to monitoring, such as daily reporting of measured temperatures. ""The conditions that the state of Maine is now requiring Kaci to comply with are unconstitutional and illegal and there is no justification for the state of Maine to infringe on her liberty,"" Siegel told the Daily News. Hickox told ""Today"" that she's in good health and is not having symptoms. A person must be symptomatic to be contagious if they have Ebola. The nurse said that she thinks it would be ""reasonable,"" in circumstances like hers, to self-monitor for symptoms but not be quarantined. Those are the steps that the organization, Doctors Without Borders, recommends. She spent time recently in Sierra Leone treating Ebola patients with the group. Hickox initially was put in isolation Friday, after landing in New Jersey from Sierra Leone. New Jersey and New York had just started requiring anyone who had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa to be quarantined for 21 days. New Jersey officials additionally said that screeners determined that she had a fever at the airport. But Hickox, speaking to CNN over the weekend from her quarantine tent at a New Jersey hospital, said she never had a fever. ""They were using a forehead scanner, and I was distressed and a little bit upset and so my cheeks were flushed,"" Hickox explained to CNN's Candy Crowley. Hickox said her temperature was later determined to be normal. Dispute about quarantine policies . New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said the state agreed to let her go to Maine after confirming she ""was no longer symptomatic,"" but is unapologetic about New Jersey's quarantine policy. Hickox told ""Today"" that she witnessed ""complete disorganization"" at the airport in Newark and that New York and New Jersey's policies are ""not scientifically"" or ""Constitutionally just."" The policies, she believes, will be a ""big deterrent"" to health care workers from going to West Africa to treat patients because they won't want to be quarantined when they return if, like her, they are asymptomatic. ""It's already difficult for people to take time out of their lives to go and respond,"" she said, though she plans on definitely going back because it feels like a ""privilege to help."" Marco Rubio: Quarantined nurse is a 'hero' Christie said he doesn't plan to move ""an inch"" on New Jersey's Ebola quarantine policy. Campaigning Tuesday in Rhode Island for GOP gubernatorial nominee Allan Fung, the straight-talking Republican also hit back at criticism that the nurse wasn't treated well enough, arguing she even had internet access and takeout food. ""Whatever,"" he said, when pressed by reporters about a potential legal challenge. ""Get in line. I've been sued lots of times before. Get in line. I'm happy to take it on."" Christie on possible Ebola lawsuit: 'Whatever' The debate about how to treat returning health care workers comes amid what officials say is the worst Ebola outbreak in history. The World Health Organization reported Wednesday that there are more than 13,700 confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola -- almost all in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The United Nations' health authority projected that deaths from the virus have exceeded 5,000. And those are only the ones that authorities have been able to count. In a region where health care access and record-keeping are limited, the WHO says the death toll may be especially under-counted. Some ill people who are seen by physicians and counted as Ebola cases may not stay for treatment and die of the disease, and the record keepers won't know to record their deaths. The WHO has said that the mortality rate from the current outbreak, starting with the first death in December, is roughly 60% to 70%. Ebola, a child and a lawsuit . The family of a third-grader in Connecticut has filed a lawsuit against Milford Public Schools, claiming that their daughter was banned from school for 21 days after returning from a trip to Lagos, Nigeria, for a family wedding. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, alleges that Ikeoluwa Opayemi was not allowed to return to Meadowside Elementary School in Milford ""based on fears"" about the deadly Ebola outbreak mainly in the West African countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Nigeria had 19 cases of Ebola and seven of those patients died. But the country was declared Ebola-free October 20 by the WHO, after 42 days with no Ebola cases reported. ""I think it's outrageous how this child was treated,"" said Gary Phelan, the attorney for the girl's family. ""At some point, making a medical decision has to based on medical information, not fear."" School officials said they would release a statement Wednesday. Phelan said the decision to keep Opayemi out of school came after complaints from parents of her classmates. The girl's father, Stephen Opayemi, was told by city officials that if he tried to bring his daughter to school she would be removed by police, the lawyer said. CNN's Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","Nurse Kaci Hickox: ""I don't plan on sticking to the guidelines"" on quarantine .

"Hundreds of anti-abortion activists gathered in Washington's Lafayette Park on Sunday on the 39th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. The 90-minute program featured speakers, music and a quick march along the White House's north gate, located in front of the park. Many carried signs and recited prayers during the gathering, which was organized by the nonprofit group March for Life. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee told the crowd the reason he got into politics is because he is ""pro-life,"" and believes ""if we get this issue wrong, we will inevitably get all the other issues wrong, too."" ""Whether the baby is in the mother's womb, or whether it's 8 years old or 18 or 80, that life has value, not because I said so, but because God made it to have value,"" said Huckabee, a Republican who made an unsuccessful presidential bid in 2008. Emily Morgan, 21, said she traveled from Cincinnati, Ohio, with her parents and pastor because she felt obligated to speak up. She told CNN she has had friends and family members who have had abortions and endured ""the emotional chaos that happens after that."" ""Killing is wrong,"" Morgan said. ""Abortion is killing unborn children."" In a statement issued early Sunday, President Obama said he remains ""committed to protecting a woman's right to choose and this fundamental constitutional right."" ""While this is a sensitive and often divisive issue, no matter what our views, we must stay united in our determination to prevent unintended pregnancies, support pregnant women and mothers, reduce the need for abortion, encourage healthy relationships, and promote adoption,"" the statement said. Obama was in the White House residence during the protest,  having spent some time earlier in the day at an off-site venue playing basketball with daughters Sasha and Malia. Other Roe v. Wade-related events were planned elsewhere in Washington Sunday and Monday, by both anti-abortion activists and abortion rights advocates alike.","Sunday was the 39th anniversary of the decision that legalized abortion .

"A Danish zoo that made international headlines last month when it killed a healthy giraffe is once again in the news after it killed four lions to make way for a new male. The lions were killed Monday, said Tobias Stenbaek Bro, a spokesman for the Copenhagen Zoo. Two of those were young lions that were not old enough to survive by themselves and would have been killed by the new male lion if it had the chance, Bro told CNN. He said the zoo had tried to place them elsewhere, ""but unfortunately there wasn't any interest."" The other two are the youngsters' parents, described by the Copenhagen Zoo as a ""very old"" breeding pair. The new male lion was brought from Givskud Zoo, also in Denmark, to form a breeding group with the Copenhagen Zoo's two 18-month-old females, born on site in 2012. The zoo had to put down the old lions and their young offspring ""because of the natural structure and behavior"" of the lion pride, the Copenhagen Zoo said in a prepared statement. The newcomer is about 3 years old, large for his age and healthy, the zoo said. After he's had a few days to adjust to his new surroundings, visitors will be able to see him. ""He is a beautiful young male and I am certain he will be an impressive ambassador for his species,"" zoo chief Steffen Straede is quoted as saying. He said the three young lions would ""be the foundation of the zoo's next lion era."" Public anger . The decision by the Copenhagen Zoo to shoot dead its giraffe, named Marius, in February to prevent inbreeding sparked widespread outrage. The killing of four healthy lions has prompted further dismay. Some questioned why the lions weren't sent elsewhere if the Copenhagen Zoo no longer had space. ""Why are people visiting this abhorrent animal slaughter house,"" said a message posted on a Facebook page that calls for the closure of the zoo. The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria -- a body governing 345 institutions -- said that the Copenhagen Zoo had not broken its codes of conduct and that it ""has been consistent in its approach to animal population management, and high standards of animal welfare."" The zoo supports natural cycles of reproduction and cub rearing, it said, and its lions are not part of a breeding program. ""While EAZA regrets the death of the animals in question, we recognize the right of Copenhagen Zoo to humanely cull them in line with their policies,"" it added. Such culling is not uncommon, although large animals are less likely to meet that fate. European Association of Zoos and Aquaria spokesman David Williams-Mitchell told CNN that across the European zoos governed by the body, about 3,000 to 5,000 animals are killed each year under programs to manage zoo populations. This includes ""everything from tadpoles and insects up to charismatic megafauna like giraffes and lions,"" he said, adding that it represents only 0.06% of the zoos' overall animal population. Exact figures are hard to come by, but a few hundred of those killed by the zoos each year would be large animals, he said. Williams-Mitchell added that members of the public and animal rights groups tend to object only when zoos kill ""cute, storybook animals,"" rather than rodents or tadpoles. Giraffe backlash . Marius the giraffe was shot by a veterinarian and dismembered in front of an audience that included children, before being fed to the zoo's lions, tigers and leopards. Addressing criticism after that killing, Bengt Holst, the zoo's scientific director, told CNN the decision was made for the greater good of the giraffe population. ""Our giraffes are part of an international breeding program, which has a purpose of ensuring a sound and healthy population of giraffes,"" he said. But the explanation did little to appease public anger. The backlash prompted another zoo in Denmark to reverse course. Jyllands Park Zoo had said it was considering culling one of its male giraffes if a female was brought in to breed. But it backtracked.","Zoo group says 3,000 to 5,000 zoo animals, from tadpoles to lions, are killed each year .

"(CNN) -- Eric Abidal is a fighter. He's also a philosopher. ""Everyone has their own destiny,"" he says. The football star's fate is now firmly in his own hands -- something he thanks God for each and every day. His faith, and fighting spirit, has helped him climb out of an abyss -- not once, but twice -- recover his strength and stand proudly tall once more. But the future did not seem so certain in March 2011. The Frenchman, then at Barcelona, was diagnosed with a cancerous liver tumor following a routine examination. It was a moment that would not only change his life, but would transform him as a person. ""It was a shock,"" he told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""But it was a quick shock because mentally I am very strong. ""I am a fighter. I had a clear and honest discussion with the doctors and the surgeons. I told them that if I had something bad in my body that it was better for them to take it out quickly. ""It was complicated to come back, but like I always say, sport enabled me to have this mental strength to fight. ""It was certainly because of that that I managed to be even stronger in that battle."" Abidal's fight with cancer shocked the world of football. The defender, a much-loved character within Catalonia after playing a key role in his team's success, received support from across the sporting world. Even the players and president of Real Madrid, Barcelona's fiercest rival, showed public support for Abidal while he was laid up in a hospital bed following the operation, which took place just days after the tumor had been found. Teams wore t-shirts urging Abidal a quick recovery, Twitter and Facebook were awash with good wishes and television pictures showed Barcelona fans singing his name in the 22nd minute of each half -- the shirt number which he wore with such distinction. The widespread support proved invaluable to Abidal. ""I remember everything,"" he says. ""When you are in hospital you can't really see what's going on outside. ""All of that certainly helped me and proved that I was cherished and liked in Catalunya and in the Barcelona team. ""It motivated me to tell people that, 'Although I am ill, I won't let myself go down. I will do everything to come back and try to finish the season with the club.' "" Most survivors would be happy to just be in a position to have their health -- but for Abidal that was simply not enough. A warrior, he was determined to fight back all the way -- not just to peak health but to a place where he could once again pull on the famous blue and red stripes of Barcelona. ""I always had fighting spirit,"" he says. ""Yes I had the illness but I still had a chance of playing sport at a high level. There are similarities between illness and sport -- you can't get beaten. ""I told myself that even though I was ill that I wouldn't allow myself to get beaten. I said, 'I am going to fight for myself, for my wife and children, my parents and all the people who surround me.' "" Abidal surprised everyone by returning to training within weeks of his diagnosis, hoping to make an incredible comeback before the end of the 2010-11 season. Such was Abidal's willpower that he did indeed return to the Barca side -- making a substitute appearance against Real Madrid on May 3. Just 25 days later he played the full 90 minutes at Wembley as Barca defeated Manchester United 3-1, and Abidal was afforded the honor of lifting the European Champions League trophy -- a gesture which he will never forget. ""It was a special moment,"" he recalls. ""There are not many of us who can win the Champions League, let alone be given the special gesture of lifting the trophy. ""It was a gesture from the whole team. The club and players lived through the difficult moments with me. ""It was an utter privilege and an honor. I will always thank my teammates for that gesture."" Less than a year later, however, Abidal was once again fighting the cancer -- in March 2012 it was revealed he needed a liver transplant due to problems the initial operation did not resolve. Teammate and close Dani Alves offered part of his, but it was not possible due to the impact it would have on his own playing career, so Abidal instead turned to his cousin Gerard. Abidal again made a heroic comeback, returning to action a year later on April 6, 2013 as Barcelona went on to regain the Spanish league title from Real. However, any thoughts of extending his six-year stay at the Camp Nou were soon extinguished once the club revealed it would not be offering him a new contract. But the No. 22 shirt is still linked with Abidal, as Alves has taken it on. ""With Dani it's unique because my wife gets along very well with his wife, we lived next to each other, I liked his mindset and vice versa,"" Abidal says of the Brazilian. ""We had a good feeling, we have a similar personality. Everyone knows about the gesture he did for me when I was ill. He remains an important person in my life."" After winning 15 trophies in his time with Barca, Abidal returned to where it all began for him as a professional -- Monaco. He began his professional career in the Principality, before going on to play for Lille and hometown club Lyon, where he won the French title in each of his three seasons before joining Barcelona for $16 million in 2007. His form this season looks likely to secure him a place in France's World Cup squad in Brazil next year -- not bad for a man who almost lost his life. ""The move back to Monaco gave me the chance to close a full circle,"" he said. ""It was important for me. It wasn't an easy choice but it was important because I started here and I wanted my kids where their dad started back in the day. ""I have pictures to show them of me when I was a little younger and things were a bit different. It's a club which gave me a lot -- a club which gave me a start as a professional and I wanted to give them something back."" The phrase ""giving back"" is one which Abidal likes to use over and over again whether it be in relation to his family or those in society who are less privileged. A devout Muslim who prays five times a day, Abidal believes he has a responsibility to work with the current generation of youngsters and help guide them through turbulent times. A leader, he likes to show by example both on and off the field -- but to the last he remains a warrior and a philosopher. ""It's important for me whatever the situation to know that we are not here by accident,"" he said. ""We certainly all have a mission on earth, mine is to help people. ""The illness I went through wasn't by accident. The way I see it is that God gives you challenges.""","Eric Abidal is a professional football player with French club Monaco .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)A former Korean Air executive who sparked outrage earlier this month by kicking a flight attendant off a plane for serving macadamia nuts the wrong way is being detained by police in Seoul. Heather Cho, the 40-year-old daughter of Korean Air's chairman, is in the South Seoul Detention Facility, the Seoul Western District Prosecutor's Office said. Officials gave no other details, other than the investigation into the incident is ongoing. A spokesman for the office, Lee Kwang-woo, said an arrest warrant  was approved because ""the necessity was recognized because of the graveness of the case and there was an attempt to systematically cover up the charges since the beginning of the incident."" Cho resigned from her post as a vice president at the company in the aftermath of the incident earlier this month on a flight from New York's JFK airport to South Korea's Incheon International Airport. She ordered that the plane turn back to the gate and that a flight attendant be removed because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a plate in first class. Although her role put her in charge of in-flight service, Cho was a passenger and was not flying in an official capacity. Amid public anger over her behavior, she and her father both apologized for the incident. Cho, whose Korean name is Cho Hyun-ah, said she accepted ""full responsibility"" for what happened. Last week, prosecutors said an arrest warrant might cover charges of violating aviation safety rules, including a change in a flight plan, assault on a plane, coercion and interference in the execution of duty. The warrant was approved Tuesday night. When contacted by CNN, the press office for Korean Air said it had no comment on the latest development. 'Violent language' Testimony from crew members and passengers confirmed that Cho used ""violent language in a loud voice,"" which may not be compliant with an aviation safety law that requires cooperation of passengers on a flight, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said earlier this month. The captain of the plane has also faced criticism for obeying Cho's demands to turn back the plane and remove the flight attendant. The airline faces possible disciplinary action from the government because of the captain's failure to command and supervise crew members to ensure the safe operation of the flight, the ministry said last week. CNN's Jethro Mullen and Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report.","Prosecutors get an arrest warrant Tuesday night .

"The U.N. Security Council, in a close 8-2 vote with five abstentions, on Tuesday voted down a Palestinian statehood resolution that set a deadline for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Palestinian territories by 2017. Eight nations voted for the draft resolution -- one vote short of the necessary nine to be adopted -- including Jordan, which sponsored the resolution, and three permanent Security Council members: ​China, Russia and France. The United States voted against the resolution on the table and had been expected to exercise its permanent council member authority and veto the measure, had it passed. The Security Council consists of 15 members, five permanent and 10 rotating members. The permanent five, China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and the United States, have veto power to block any resolution. The resolution called for an end of Israeli troops in Palestinian territories -- including the West Bank -- by 2017 and set a 12-month deadline for a peace solution, with two separate states. It also identified East Jerusalem as the capital of what would be called Palestine. Palestine currently is not recognized as a state. In November 2012, the General Assembly voted to upgrade the status of the Palestinians to ""non-member observer state."" Jordanian envoy: World ready for move . Dina Kawar, Jordan's ambassador to the United Nations and the sponsor of the draft, said she hoped the Security Council would have adopted the resolution because the council ""bears both the legal and the moral responsibilities to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which is the crux of the conflict in the Middle East."" Elements in the draft resolution, including the right for Palestinian people for self-determination, a two-state solution with East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine and an end to what it calls Israeli occupation were ""acceptable not only to members of the Security Council but to the international community as a whole,"" Kawar said. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said no other country in the world has invested more than the United States in pursuing peace between Israel and the Palestinians, but said the resolution ""would undermine efforts to get back to an atmosphere that makes it possible to achieve two states for two people."" Power said that the current resolution was ""deeply unbalanced"" and instead of giving a voice to both sides, only considered the concerns of one. ""Today's vote should not be interpreted as a victory for an unsustainable status quo, instead it should serve as a wake-up call to catalyze all interested parties to take constructive, responsible steps to achieve a two-state solution,"" Power said. Australia also voted against the measure. The Palestinian representative at the United Nations, Riyad Mansour,  told the diplomats that it is ""most regrettable that the Security Council remains paralyzed."" ""The repeated requests for us to 'wait,' and 'wait,' and 'wait' while our people are suffering, while our people are besieged, while our land is being colonized, and while the two-state solution is being destroyed and the prospects for peace are evaporating, must understand that such requests are not viable under these circumstances and are unsustainable,"" he said. Israeli: ""Political games' continue . ""The Palestinians have found every possible opportunity to avoid direct negotiations with Israel,"" said Israel Nitzan, a counselor representing Israel at the meeting, and called the most recent ""unilateral"" draft the latest endeavor in a ""never-ending string of political games."" ""I have news for the Palestinians: you cannot agitate and provoke your way to a state,"" Nitzan said. Five countries abstained from the vote, including permanent member United Kingdom. UK Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant told the Security Council, ""We consider President (Mahmoud) Abbas a man of peace and understand the pressure that the Palestinian leadership has been under to act and their frustration at the lack of progress. But we are disappointed that the normal, and necessary, negotiation did not take place on this occasion. "" After the meeting, Jordan's  Kawar told reporters that although she would have liked more consultations and negotiations to ""come up with a product that would be acceptable to the 15"" [member states,] the importance of this resolution was ""to put some momentum and dynamics in the Security Council.""","U.N.

"The Kremlin sends troops across the border, and the United States and its allies cry foul. It's happened before -- Afghanistan in 1979, Georgia in 2008 -- and now Russian President Vladimir Putin has essentially seized military control of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. The move reflects the still simmering political and social upheaval from the breakup of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago. What hasn't changed much are the limited options available to President Barack Obama and European powers to respond to the Kremlin's aggression. The United States and some other countries boycotted the Moscow Olympics in 1980, and Washington helped arm Afghan rebels against Soviet forces, who eventually went back home. In Georgia, Russia backed secessionist bids in the South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions in sovereignty disputes that remain unresolved. The United States and European Union consider the regions part of Georgia. Here is a look at possible responses to Putin's latest move in Ukraine: . Military . Unless a sudden escalation causes open warfare between Ukraine and Russia, forget about any kind of U.S. or allied military response. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday the United States was keeping its options open, but he made a point of adding that escalated military involvement would ""not serve the world well."" ""The last thing anybody wants is a military option in this kind of situation,"" Kerry said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Even veteran Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a proponent of exerting U.S. influence abroad, conceded that the fight must involve diplomacy, not the military. ""There is not a military option that could be exercised now,"" McCain said Monday in remarks at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual conference. ""But the most powerful and biggest and strongest nation in the world should have plenty of options."" On Monday, the United States put on hold all military-to-military engagements with Russia, an official announced. ""Although the Department of Defense finds value in the military-to-military relationship with the Russian Federation we have developed over the past few years to increase transparency, build understanding, and reduce the risk of military miscalculation, we have, in light of recent events in Ukraine, put on hold all military-to-military engagements between the United States and Russia. This includes exercises, bilateral meetings, port visits and planning conferences,"" said Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby. He denied reports speculating on possible ship movements in the region. ""There has been no change to our military posture in Europe or the Mediterranean; our Navy units continue to conduct routine, previously planned operations and exercises with allies and partners in the region,"" he said. John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in the administration of Republican President George W. Bush, suggested one possible military response would be for NATO to agree to deploy additional forces in countries with significant Russian populations. Herbst noted on CNN that Russia used the need to protect Russian citizens and interests as a pretext for what he called ""blatant aggression"" in Ukraine now and previously in Georgia. What you need to know . G8 . The annual summit of the world's industrial powers is scheduled for Russian Olympic venue Sochi in June, but  the United States and other members have halted planning for the gathering amid calls for Russia to be kicked out. Once known as the G7, the group that also includes Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Canada agreed to add Russia in 1998 to reflect the changing geopolitical dynamic after the Cold War and breakup of the Soviet Union. Revoking Russia's membership would isolate Putin diplomatically to deny him the Western acceptance he has sought. ""He will be isolated more. He won't look good in front of his people,"" CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour said Monday. Such isolation would bolster economic isolation and sanctions -- a more effective strategy to pressure Putin. ""The G8 plus some others and all of them, every single one of them are prepared to go to the hilt in order to isolate Russia with respect to this invasion,"" Kerry said Sunday on the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" A divided Ukraine? Think again . Sanctions . Obama said Monday the United States is examining a series of economic and diplomatic steps to ""isolate Russia."" Kerry also said foreign leaders were prepared to act as well, noting the possibilities include visa bans, asset freezes and isolation by the international community on trade and investment. Republican Rep. Ed Royce of California, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN on Monday that  ""the Achilles heel for Russia is their economy -- the ruble."" ""We have to lead and we have to rally Europe around a series of steps that would actually impact the Russians economically: sanctions against state-owned banks,"" Royce said. Later Monday, a spokesman told CNN that the United States has suspended upcoming trade and investment talks with Russia. ""Due to recent events in Ukraine, we have suspended upcoming bilateral trade and investment engagement with the Government of Russia that were part of a move toward deeper commercial and trade ties,"" said the U.S. trade representative spokesman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. What's happening? Depends on whom you ask . Diplomacy . Obama had a lengthy phone call with Putin over the weekend in which the U.S. leader said his Russian counterpart violated international law by sending military forces into Crimea, according to a White House statement. ""President Obama wants to emphasize to the Russians that there are a right set of choices that can still be made to address any concerns they have about Crimea, about their citizens, but you don't choose to invade a country in order to do that,"" Kerry said on CBS. Putin has yet to make any substantive public statement about the situation, which follows the successful staging of the Winter Olympics in Sochi to bring Putin and Russia some pride in the international community. The thrust of the Russian position is that it had the right to protect the interests of Russians in eastern Ukraine. On Monday, Vice President Joe Biden called Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to urge Russia to ""pull back its forces, support the immediate deployment of international monitors to Ukraine, and begin a meaningful political dialogue with the Ukrainian government,"" the White House said. Obama outlined a similar approach to reporters later Monday, saying that should satisfy Russian concerns of protecting the rights of ethnic Russian residents and Russian citizens in Ukraine. Separately, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the United States has scrapped plans to send a presidential delegation to the upcoming Winter Paralympic Games in Sochi. U.S. athletes still plan to compete. Politics . Congress will have a say in the focus and size of a U.S. response, with calls already for a possible sanctions package. Hawkish Republicans have criticized Obama for what they called a lack of resolve that they say emboldened Putin to send troops into the Crimea region. McCain called Obama's foreign policy ""feckless"" on Monday, after House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers of Michigan said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that Putin and Russia had been ""running circles around us."" Fellow GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of  South Carolina called for reviving plans for a NATO missile defense shield in Poland that Russia opposed. Obama told reporters on Monday that there should be ""unanimity"" between Democrats and Republicans in seeking to preserve ""the principle that no country has the right to send in troops to another country unprovoked."" ""My expectation is we ought to be able to get Congress to work with us to achieve that goal,"" he said, specifically calling for an economic assistance package for Ukraine to help provide stability during the crisis. Sen. Robert Menendez, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Monday the panel was putting together legislation to provide $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine's economy. ""We are also consulting with the administration on possible sanctions actions against individual Russians and Ukrainians that range from visa bans and asset freezes, to the suspension of military cooperation and sales, as well as economic sanctions,"" the New Jersey Democrat said. A Republican member of the committee, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, told CNN he was urging the panel to speak with ""one voice"" to ""show the Russians that this is something we are unified in."" ""It will send a much more powerful signal and hopefully get Putin to think twice,"" Johnson said, adding that ""Putin needs to pay a big price here"" because ""this is no time to be shrinking violets and rely on words.""","The U.S. suspends upcoming trade, investment talks with Russia, official says .

"Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea just gave it away, confirming what everyone already suspected. The rock group's halftime performance at Super Bowl XLVIII was pre-recorded. The band's guitars were not plugged in. The Red Hot Chili Peppers performed Sunday night alongside Bruno Mars. ""When we were asked by the NFL and Bruno to play our song Give It Away at the Super Bowl, it was made clear to us that the vocals would be live, but the bass, drums, and guitar would be pre-recorded. ""I understand the NFL's stance on this, given they only have a few minutes to set up the stage, there a zillion things that could go wrong and ruin the sound for the folks watching in the stadium and the t.v. viewers. There was not any room for argument on this, the NFL does not want to risk their show being botched by bad sound, period,"" Flea wrote Tuesday on the band's website. He said that he and his bandmates -- Anthony Kiedis, Josh Klinghoffer and Chad Smith -- thought long and hard about doing the show given those conditions. ""We decided that, with Anthony singing live, that we could still bring the spirit and freedom of what we do into the performance, and of course we played every note in the recording specially for the gig. I met and spoke with Bruno, who was a beautiful dude, a real talented musician, and we worked out something that seemed like it would be fun,"" Flea wrote. He said the band was not trying to trick anyone. The bassist continued: ""For the actual performance, Josh, Chad, and I were playing along with the pre recorded track so there was no need to plug in our guitars, so we did not. ""Could we have plugged them in and avoided bumming people out who have expressed disappointment that the instrumental track was pre recorded? Of course easily we could have and this would be a non-issue. We thought it better to not pretend. It seemed like the realest thing to do in the circumstance.

"The Louisiana delegation is offering bipartisan support to Rep. Steve Scalise, who is embroiled in scandal surrounding his 2002 address to a white supremacist forum. Rep. Cedric Richmond, the lone Democrat in Louisiana's House delegation, offered his full-throated support to the congressman in an interview with the New Orleans Times-Picayune Monday night. ""I don't think Steve Scalise has a racist bone in his body,"" Richmond, who is African American, told the paper. ""Steve and I have worked on issues that benefit poor people, black people, white people, Jewish people. I know his character."" He added: ""I am not going to let them use Steve as a scapegoat to score political points when I know him and know his family,"" Richmond said. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, also backed the congressman in a statement. ""I know Congressman Scalise to be a good man who is fair-minded and kindhearted. I'm confident he absolutely rejects racism in all its forms,"" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said in a statement. A local Louisiana blog reported this weekend on blog posts and documents revealing that Scalise spoke at a 2002 event for the National/International EURO Workshop on Civil Rights, a white nationalist organization founded by David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. The controversy surrounding his appearance at the event has raised questions over whether Scalise will continue to serve as Majory Whip, the third-ranking position in House leadership. House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, however, have remained silent on the situation since the news broke. RELATED: Whip lashed by critics . Scalise has disavowed the group's beliefs and said he wasn't aware of them when he spoke at the forum. In an interview with the Times-Picayune, Scalise chalked up the misunderstanding to a staff flub. ""I didn't know who all of these groups were and I detest any kind of hate group. For anyone to suggest that I was involved with a group like that is insulting and ludicrous,"" he said. He added: ""I had one person that was working for me. When someone called and asked me to speak, I would go. I was, in no way, affiliated with that group or the other groups I was talking to."" CNN has learned that the staffer at the time was Cameron Henry, who currently represents Scalise's former state House seat. Henry rushed CNN off the phone Monday night and declined to discuss the situation, but did not deny his work for the congressman. Henry's brother, Charles Henry, is Scalise's current chief of staff. Neither responded to requests for comment on Tuesday. But Democrats were already taking aim at Scalise on Tuesday morning, and trying to goad House leadership into weighing in. ""Steve Scalise chose to cheerlead for a group of KKK members and neo-Nazis at a white supremacist rally and now his fellow House Republican Leaders can't even speak up and say he was wrong. While David Duke defends Scalise, Speaker Boehner and Leader McCarthy are refusing to condemn Scalise's choice of allies,"" said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee National Press Secretary Josh Schwerin. Schwerin said the incident made it ""clear their leadership has a history of embracing anti-Semitic, racist hate groups."" ""Republicans are off to a banner start for their new Congress -- on the path to break their own record for least popular Congress in history,"" he added.","The Louisiana delegation is offering bipartisan support to Rep.

"There are two Rick Santorums: The first one I might not agree with, but the second one truly scares me. ""Santorum One"" pushes for less government regulation for corporations and shrinking the federal government.  You may or may not agree with these positions, but they are both mainstream conservative fare. Then there's ""Santorum Two."" This Santorum wants to impose conservative Christian law upon America.  Am I being hyperbolic or overly dramatic with this statement? I wish I were, but I'm not. Plainly put, Rick Santorum wants to convert our current legal system into one that requires our laws to be in agreement with religious law, not unlike what the Taliban want to do in Afghanistan. Santorum is not hiding this. The only reason you may not be aware of it is because up until his recent surge in the polls, the media were ignoring him. However, ""Santorum Two"" was out there telling anyone who would listen. He told a crowd at a November campaign stop in Iowa in no uncertain terms, ""our civil laws have to comport with a higher law: God's law."" On Thanksgiving Day at an Iowa candidates' forum, he reiterated: ""We have civil laws, but our civil laws have to comport with the higher law."" Yes, that means exactly what you think it does: Santorum believes that each and every one of our government's laws must match God's law, warning that ""as long as there is a discordance between the two, there will be agitation."" I'm not exactly sure what ""agitation"" means in this context, but I think it's a code word for something much worse than acid reflux. And as an aside, when Santorum says ""God,"" he means ""not any god (but) the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.""  So, if your god differs from Rick's, your god's views will be ignored, just like the father is on ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians."" Some of you might be asking: How far will ""Santorum Two"" take this?  It's not like he's going to base public policy decisions on Bible passages, right? Well, here's what Santorum had to say just last week when asked about his opposition to gay marriage: ""We have Judeo-Christian values that are based on biblical truth. ... And those truths don't change just because people's attitudes may change."" Santorum could not be more unambiguous: His policy decisions will be based on ""biblical truths,"" and as he noted, these ""truths"" will not change regardless of whether public opinion has evolved since the time the Bible was written thousands of years ago. Imagine if either of the two Muslim members of Congress declared their support for a proposed American law based on verses from the Quran. The outcry would be deafening, especially from people like Santorum. One of the great ironies is that Santorum has been a leader in sounding alarm bells that Muslims want to impose Islamic law -- called Sharia law -- upon non-Muslims in America.  While Santorum fails to offer even a scintilla of credible evidence to support this claim, he continually warns about the ""creeping"" influence of Muslim law. Santorum's fundamental problem with Sharia law is that it's ""not just a religious code. It is also a governmental code. It happens to be both religious in nature and origin, but it is a civil code."" Consequently, under the Sharia system, the civil laws of the land must comport with God's law. Now, where did I hear about someone wanting to impose only laws that agree with God's law in America? So, what type of nation might the United States be under Rick Santorum's Sharia law? 1. Rape victims would be forced to give birth to the rapist's child. Santorum has stated that his religious beliefs dictate that life begins at conception, and as a result, rape victims would be sentenced to carrying the child of the rapist for nine months. 2. Gay marriages would be annulled. Santorum recently declared that not only does he oppose gay marriages, but he supports a federal constitutional amendment that would ban them, invalidating all previous gay marriages that have legally been sanctioned by states and thus callously destroying marriages and thrusting families into chaos. 3. Santorum would ban all federal funding for birth control and would not oppose any state that wanted to pass laws making birth control illegal. 4. No porn! I'm not kidding. Santorum signed ""The Marriage Vow"" pledge (PDF) authored by the Family Leader organization, under which he swears to oppose pornography. I think many would agree that alone should disqualify him from being president. To me, ""Santorum Two"" truly poses an existential threat to the separation of church and state, one of the bedrock principles of our nation since its inception. Not only did Thomas Jefferson speak of the need to create ""a wall of separation between church and state,"" so did Santorum's idol, Ronald Reagan, who succinctly stated, ""church and state are, and must remain, separate."" While there may be millions of Americans who in their heart agree with the views of ""Santorum Two,"" it is my hope they will reject any attempts to move America closer to a becoming the Afghanistan of the Western Hemisphere.","Dean Obeidallah: Santorum would like to impose Christian law on U.S.

"Dolakha, Nepal (CNN)As snow layered the trail before him, Hari Chaudhary thought it was odd. The veteran trekking guide had never seen snow on the trail in early October. The popular 21-day Annapurna Circuit takes trekkers in a horseshoe-shaped route around a majestic segment of the Himalayas in Nepal. On the 10th day of the tour, Chaudhary and his clients, two young Israeli women, were descending from the highest point of the trail, Thorung La Pass, to the next destination, a walk that would normally take about seven hours. Now, after more than 10 hours of heading downhill, the snow pelted. The flurry fell heavier and faster, obstructing their vision. There was nowhere to stop or rest; they had to keep walking. ""You couldn't see the trail, there was snow everywhere, making it easy to get lost,"" said Chaudhary. ""It was all white, in the distance you could only see shadows of people walking."" Some wandered off the trail. As the blizzard continued, their feet sunk into the snow pile. As their steps became heavier, they began to cry. As the hours passed, Chaudhary could make out backpacks and supplies strewn on the snow. ""There were people who had fallen, or were stuck or resting along the way. I couldn't tell if I saw a dead body."" Conditions in the Himalayas can be cruel. But trekkers dying in snowstorms on the Annapurna Circuit is almost unheard of -- until this year. Deadly year . Nepal, known for its fabled Himalayas including Mount Everest, has endured a deadly, tragic year. In April, a hanging glacial mass collapsed and tumbled through a dangerous route on Everest, killing 16 Sherpas in the worst single disaster. Months later, an unseasonal snowstorm struck Annapurna, killing at least 43 people including locals and foreign tourists. Were the disasters just prone to happen or was climate change a factor? Everest mountaineers have spoken of changes they've witnessed for years. ""In my first journey, there was snow and ice,"" said Apa Sherpa, a retired mountaineer who made his first summit in 1990. ""Now we can see more rock. It's more dangerous ... the glacier's melting, the ice is falling, there's rocks falling more."" After a record 21 summits of Everest, he has no doubt that conditions are changing rapidly. Dawa Stephen Sherpa, who has been climbing Everest since 2006, agreed: ""Our observations show that seracs are peeling off the mountains much quicker and we're seeing avalanches much more frequently and of greater magnitude."" Whether the deadly disasters in Nepal this year can be linked to climate change is debatable. ""I am leery of attributing everything bad in nature to climate change,"" said Jeffrey Kargel, senior associate research scientist at the University of Arizona who studies the Himalayas. ""Sorting out what's specifically due to climate change and what's not is a difficult and sometimes impossible task. That said, it's clear climate is changing all over the world, including in Nepal."" While it's difficult to blame any single incident on climate change, there's evidence of an increasingly warming Himalayas. Temperatures in the central Himalayas increased by about 0.6 degrees Celsius per decade between 1977 and 2000, according to one study. In the Tibetan Plateau, the average temperature in Lhasa rose by 1.35 degrees Celsius in 30 years, according to a report by International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. The impact of climate change includes accelerated glacial melt, irregular rainfall, changes in the monsoon season and greater risk of catastrophes such as avalanches, landslides and floods. Natural disasters always happen, regardless of climate change, experts say. What's worrisome is that disasters in the Himalayas are becoming more common. Extreme flooding hit Pakistan in 2012 and landslides and flooding washed away streets and killed hundreds in 2013 at a Himalayan holy site in Kedernath, India. Unusually early and heavy monsoon rains triggered that disaster, in which two months of rain poured in two days. ""These extreme rare events, they're not rare anymore,"" Kargel said. Water towers of Asia . The Himalayas stretch from the eastern corner of Afghanistan, through Nepal to the northern tip of Myanmar. They contain snow packs and glaciers with freshwater that feed 10 major Asian rivers, including the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Mekong, Yellow and Yangtze, giving life to the continent's farms. Disruptions to the Himalayas could affect agriculture, as well as water and food security for Asian countries including the two most populous countries in the world -- India and China. Nepal sits sandwiched between these two countries, which are among the world's biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. But Nepal emits 0.025% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, according to estimates. ""We have not swallowed poison, yet we are being poisoned,"" said Dr. Govind Raj Pokharel, vice chairman of the Nepal's planning commission. ""We haven't done anything against nature or contributed to climate change, but we are majorly affected."" Farmers at risk . In Nepal, climate change is already impacting lives and livelihood, scientists say. ""Climate change is making things worse,"" said Deepak K.C., senior program officer for integrated climate risk management at the United Nations Development Program. ""There are lots of dry spurts, interspersed with heavy rain in a short period of time that's causing flooding."" Farmers say that pests they've never seen before are eating their crops. The monsoon rains they've traditionally expected to arrive in June have become inconsistent, many say. ""We depend on timely rainfall for crop cultivation,"" said Purnimaya Thamang, a farmer who lives in a small village near the foot of the Himalayas. ""We may not be able to feed ourselves or have the proper yield. The rain is either too late, too little or too much."" It wasn't like this before, they say. Nepal's mountains are encircled with terrace farms where families have tilled the soil for generations. More than 70% of Nepalis work in agriculture and most are subsistence farmers. Many farmers, like Ganesh Thami, have seen landslides and floods destroy their livelihoods. He woke up several years ago to his house trembling as a flood swept over his farmland. ""The river beating the stones made drumming sounds that kept growing. I heard the sound of the boulders rolling with the water. It felt like an earthquake,"" said Thami, who lost his farm in Dolakha, near the Himalayas. Dolakha is identified as one of the most vulnerable districts to landslides according to a national study on climate change conducted by the Nepalese government. The farmers say their livelihood is becoming harder and they don't know why. ""The people that are hit the hardest are not the ones causing the climate change,"" said David Molden, director general of the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. ""That's the important message. The poorest people in the world are emitting the least amount of carbon, (yet) they're the ones who have to adapt dramatically to these changes."" In harms way . One of the issues is that some villages and homes are cropping up too close to a river or in dangerous areas prone to landslides or floods. ""People who are building are unaware that they're in dire jeopardy,"" Kargel said. ""Right now, there's uncontrolled growth, in very vulnerable places, with houses sitting on river bluffs."" The mountains have always carried risk of landslides, avalanches and snowstorms even without climate change. But new developments in vulnerable areas exacerbate the risks of making them casualty events. ""The Himalayas are changing, the way people are living in the Himalayas is changing too,"" said Molden. ""People are living closer to the river, there are more trekkers and mountain climbers."" As Everest has become more commercial, the number of expeditions has increased. In 2013, 658 climbers summited the peak, compared with 192 two decades ago. About 20,000 people a year now trek around the Annapurnas. More people climbing and trekking means a greater probability of disasters that impact tourists and local hires. ""People were not prepared"" It's riskier for local hires, like Hari Chaudhary, who are exposed to greater risks because of repeated trips. ""Why would you want to go to the mountains? I only do it because I need to survive and I need the money,"" he said. The only opportunities for uneducated, landless men are to take a construction job in the Middle East or work in tourism, said Chaudhary, a lanky man with a wiry frame. He has to support his wife and two kids. During the blizzard, he guided his two clients to safety after 12 hours. While dozens died, went missing or had their hands blackened from frostbite, he and his two Israeli hikers survived without injuries. For a day's work of carrying 50 pounds of gear and guiding tourists, he earns $10. The Annapurna snowstorm was the effect of Cyclone Hudhud, which lashed India and wound up north in Nepal in October. Hundreds of tourists and local hires were stranded when the storms hit. ""People were not prepared, they didn't get the warning signals, like they should have,"" said Molden. While the Annapurna event cannot be definitively ruled as a climate change-related disaster, it can't be ruled out either, scientists say. ""The speculation to the link to climate change is we're getting more intense rainfall or precipitation,"" said Molden. ""It's so hard to say that event was due to climate change. All of these things have a relation. To prove that would be difficult."" Chaudhary attributes his survival to the rings of ice that formed around his ankles, which blocked snow from seeping into his bright orange Nikes, saving his feet from frostbite. Just three days later, Chaudhary laced the same sneakers and headed back to the mountains to guide another group, glancing upward to the clouds that, for him and others, were becoming increasingly difficult to decipher. This story was made possible by a reporting grant from the International Center for Journalists. A second part about solutions will run in 2015. Journalist Manesh Shrestha also contributed to this report.","Recent deadly mountain incidents in Himalayas have created concern about climate change .

"My daughter graduated from Duplos to traditional LEGOs when she was 5, around the time the iconic building blocks maker released its Friends line based on five female characters. My daughter was interested in science and art, but LEGO was interested in selling her pink beauty salons and cupcake bakeries. When we went LEGO shopping, she expressed frustration over the lack of female ""minifigures"" in her favorite LEGOs, such as the blue- and black-packaged City set or the yellow-boxed Dino world. LEGO has expanded the Friends line by introducing activities such as biking, camping and playing sports. But now at 7, my daughter is very much aware of the gender disparity in toy marketing. She sees it in the color-coded toy aisles, where male characters outnumber females, and she's frustrated that she does not see more female characters in toys she likes. The Friends line encapsulates my problem with LEGO: the lack of female minifigures in the yellow, blue and black boxes and the lack of males in the Friends sets. It's obvious from walking through a toy store that LEGO has focused its licensing and product development around boys. To capture the girl market, LEGO created the alternate, girl-only world of Heartlake City for Friends instead of incorporating more females into existing LEGO sets. LEGO says the line was one of its most successful to date, ""surpassing early projections to triple the number of girls building with LEGO bricks"" in 2012. But that still leaves the market wide open for children such as my daughter, who want more female ""minifigs"" in gender-neutral packaging. Instead, LEGO clearly distinguishes which sets are aimed at boys or girls, and our children take in the colors on the packaging and placement on the shelves through a cultural lens. They get the message loud and clear. LEGO is the second-largest toy manufacturer in the world; gender parity matters in a product that is consumed and loved by so many children. When kids play across gender lines . Through my business and blog, I frequently discuss gender stereotypes in children's products. A few weeks ago, a dad in New Zealand pointed out the LEGO CUUSOO competition site, which allows LEGO enthusiasts to submit product ideas on which the community may vote. The father asked me to use my social media following to promote a project called the ""Female Minifigure Set,"" comprising 13 ideas for female minifigures engaged in astronomy, chemistry, geology, zoology, firefighting and law enforcement. I loved the project's focus on women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. These are examples I want for my daughter and son. If my daughter sees females in these roles, she is more likely to believe that she can fill these roles as an adult. If my son grows up with females occupying an equal amount of space in his toys, he is more likely to become an adult who respects women and sees them as equals. Teen says pink Easy-Bake oven discourages boys from playing kitchen . Research shows that when women make up 25% or more of a group, stereotypes begin to drop off, according to gender activist group SPARK Summit. About 16% of LEGO minifigures are female, and this number includes the Friends line, according to SPARK Summit analysis. The project reached 10,000 votes on June 13, thanks in large part to social media. LEGO said the project will advance to the review phase, where a LEGO review board will examine the idea. During the campaign to get 10,000 votes, I noticed how many times people commented they would buy these sets because their sons and daughters wanted them. I drafted a Change.org petition to aggregate these consumer voices and let LEGO executives know that if they make the Female Minifigure Set, we will buy it in droves. The petition asks LEGO's decision-makers to consider the voices of more than 9,000 petition signers who say they would buy female LEGO Minifigs for our sons and daughters. While gender equality in toys is largely seen as a girl-power issue, dozens of comments on the petition indicate that parents understand it's important for boys and girls to see female characters doing smart and daring things. I think LEGO is a wonderful toy with a few not wonderful parts. LEGO gives my son and daughter a chance to play side by side. And in the end, that is what I am after, a space that is equal for boys and girls.","Melissa Atkins Wardy launched a petition asking LEGO to make proposed Female Minifigure Set .

"Abu Dhabi (CNN)""Do you know what the Islamic State (ISIS) will do with you?"" members of the terrorist group's propaganda wing ask their captive, who appears to be wearing an orange jumpsuit.  ""Yes. They will kill me,"" the hostage replies. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has just published in its latest English-language magazine Dabiq what it claims is an ""interview"" with the Jordanian pilot captured in Syria. Militants say they downed an F-16 jet manned by Moaz al-Kassasbeh as he took part in U.S.-led coalition air strikes near ISIS's de-facto capital, Raqqah, last week. Images provided by the extremist organization's media wing and circulated widely on social media showed bearded men with Kalashnikovs pulling the terrified airman out of a nearby river. ""We entered the region of Raqqah to sweep the area, then the striker jets entered to begin their attack,"" al-Kassasbeh said, according to the online publication. ""My plane was struck by a heat-seeking missile. I heard and felt its hit."" The Jordanian government and U.S. Central Command described the incident as an aircraft crash and adamantly stated that it was not shot down by ISIS. ""I checked the system display and it indicated that the engine was damaged and burning,"" the pilot is quoted as saying. ""The plane began to deviate from its normal flight path, so I ejected. I landed in the Furat River by parachute and the seat caught on some ground, keeping me fixed, until I was captured by soldiers of the Islamic State."" A still image of al-Kassasbeh wearing the orange jumpsuit tops the short article titled: ""The Capture of the Crusader Pilot."" Journalist James Foley, American NGO founder Peter Kassig, and British aid worker Alan Henning among other hostages wore similar outfits in videos purporting to show their murders at the hands of the extremists. The magazine also contains an article claimed to have been authored by British hostage John Cantlie, headlined ""Meltdown."" The article suggests the world is facing economic collapse and says ""it makes enormous sense for the Islamic State to mint their own gold dinars."" Cantlie was a photojournalist and freelance writer for major British newspapers, before he was kidnapped in November 2012 along with American journalist James Foley, who was also killed by ISIS militants. The family of the captured Jordanian pilot have made several emotional pleas for his release and called on the Jordanian government to launch an investigation into the crash. ""Be supportive of our brother Moaz and to be merciful on him, please send him back to us,"" Jawad al-Kassasbeh told CNN Arabic last Friday. ""He is just a soldier who is following orders and has no authority.""

"It's carnival season, that pre-Lent period of collective frenzy that celebrates overindulgence and transgression before Ash Wednesday ushers in a more sober time of prayer, penance and abstention in the weeks leading up to Easter. But the roots of carnival are both older and newer than the Christian traditions that started in Europe and have spread with colonialism throughout much of the world. Ancient Greek and Roman pagan rituals as well as the folklore, music and dance of colonized peoples have forged colorful expressions of each country's respective history and cultures. Creative disguises and parody are characteristic of carnival in many countries, which historically gave oppressed and marginalized groups the opportunity to subvert norms of class, race and gender. Here are some of the most dazzling carnival celebrations around the world. New Orleans (January 6 - March 4) As winter drags into March, the Big Easy will explode into a cacophony of color, music and dance. Carnival started here January 6, but it's the weekend before Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday (March 4), that has become the biggest street party in the United States. Contrary to reputation, carnival here is largely a family friendly affair, with the most authentic events taking place far from the rum-soaked, topless naughtiness of the French Quarter. If you're looking to experience the unique traditions of New Orleans' carnival, you need to find the ""krewes,"" neighborhood social clubs that organize their own parades, complete with flashy floats and their own carnival king and queen. Be sure to bring bags to catch the ""throws"" -- beads, stuffed animals and other trinkets that are tossed to the crowd. Information about parade schedules, routes and other carnival events and history is available online, although routes are subject to change up until the day of the parade. New Orleans also illustrates the story of carnival throughout the New World: Groups that were initially excluded from the festivities, especially people of African descent, created their own parallel celebrations, which over time flourished and became fundamental features of carnival. In New Orleans, nothing demonstrates this history like the Mardi Gras Indians. Distinct from the krewes, these ""tribes,"" or ""gangs,"" began appearing in late 19th century New Orleans, representing specific neighborhoods. In the old days, gangs would battle one another to assert territory. Today, they battle for the title of ""prettiest"" big chief, the ceremonial leader of each tribe. The chief and his family work on his carnival costume throughout the year, constructing stunning suits of satin, beads, sequins and rhinestones and enormous plumed headdresses that shake and sway like some rare, exotic creature. Other members of the tribe along with spectators march randomly through their neighborhood, where they may encounter other Indians. They dance to the sounds of jazz, blues and the distinctive call-and-response that brings the sounds of West Africa to the rich musical melting pot of Louisiana. Mardi Gras Indians do not march on specific city-sanctioned routes, so talk to locals and tourist information officials to find out where and when to see them. www.mardigrasneworleans.com . Rio de Janeiro (February 28 - March 4) Carnival, or carnaval, in Rio tends to conjure images of glittering bikinis, body paint and huge plumed headdresses. But it actually had an elite, predominantly European character until the 20th century, when African and indigenous traditions -- in particular samba music -- began to play a central role in the celebrations. That shift helped made Rio's carnival the biggest, most spectacular one on the planet. The huge Samba Parade is held at the massive Sambodromo, an exhibition area designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. Here you'll see Rio's famous samba schools compete all night while spectators generate a powerful energy in the stands. As throughout the Americas, the heart and soul of Rio's carnival is in working class neighborhoods and favelas, the city's mountainside slums, many of which have become considerably safer for tourists in recent years. Each neighborhood has its own samba street bands and costumed participants, along with throngs of locals and tourists who dance along. www.rio-carnival.net/ . Venice, Italy (February 15-March 4) Half a world away from Rio's dazzling sun-drenched street party, Venice offers possibly the world's most romantic carnival destination. Get ready to be transported back in time as ladies in Renaissance-era gowns and men in ruffled coats and powdered wigs stroll through the city's famous piazzas while gondoliers transport partygoers to elaborate feasts and masquerade balls. From mid-February until Shrove Tuesday (March 4), the city is a place of mystery and enchantment. The festivities begin with the Flight of the Angel, featuring a woman in full carnival regalia who descends from a bell tower in St. Mark's Square. The square is the center of carnival action, with jugglers, acrobats and a variety of musicians. On Shrove Tuesday, known elsewhere as Fat Tuesday, the celebration concludes with a costumed ball and fireworks in front of the Palazzo Ducale. While some Venetians and visitors may plunk down thousands for custom-made gowns and masks, you don't have to break the bank. Rent a costume, or fashion your own with a makeshift cape and a beautiful mask purchased from any cart along the canals. Presto! -- you're part of the scene. www.carnevale.venezia.it/ . Cologne, Germany (February 28-March 4) The energy of German karneval is largely generated by people of all ages who gather in public spaces or bars to sing, dance and drink the days and nights away. But Cologne's carnival is also famous for its parades -- in particular, audacious (and at times lewd) satirical floats depicting well-known politicians. Rose Monday, the second to the last day of carnival, features the largest parade of the season. See bands, satirical floats and thousands of spectators in creative, colorful costumes depicting everything from animals to priests, nuns, clowns and devils. Don't miss the alternative carnival, which since the 1980s has become a fixture of the season. Don a ghoulish costume and join the ghost parade, a tradition dating back to the Middle Ages. Then, the night before Ash Wednesday, celebrate the burning of the Nubbel, in which a straw figure is charged with all the sins committed during the year and then burned as onlookers sing in a collective purging. Learn all about carnival in Cologne at the Kölner Karnevalsmuseum. www.cologne.de/events/cologne-carnival . Montevideo, Uruguay (January 20-early March) Uruguay may be small, but its carnival is mighty, lasting 40 days. That's longer than any carnival in the world. It starts with the selection of the carnival queen in January, followed by lavish parades. Then begin the tablados -- stages across the city where carnival shows are held. One of the main events is the murga, groups of musicians that perform a form of street theater involving powerful, haunting choral song that incorporate clever parody and satire. Neighborhood murga groups work throughout the year on themes, lyrics and beautiful costumes reminiscent of commedia dell'arte characters, complete with painted faces, colorful capes and lavish headgear. Top groups compete in large theaters around Montevideo, but you can also catch fantastic performances at the tablados throughout the city, many of which cost little or nothing. Murga: A musical tale of two cities . Another must-see Uruguayan carnival tradition is candombe, unique drumming rhythms developed by enslaved Africans and their descendants during Spanish colonial rule. Today, candombe is thriving, particularly in historically Afro-Uruguayan neighborhoods like Barrio Sur and Palermo where candombe schools hold llamadas, call-and-response drumming processions, in the streets. Lear more about Uruguayan carnival traditions at the Museo del Carnival, located in Montevideo's charming old city. Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago (March 3 and 4) Officially, carnival in Trinidad's Port of Spain is the two days before Ash Wednesday. Unofficially, the city fills with the sounds of the steel pan -- calypso, limbo competitions and soca (a popular fusion of calypso and traditional Indian instruments) -- right after Christmas. Carnival in these Caribbean islands reflects their multicultural heritage. People of African, European, Amerindian, Indian, Middle Eastern and Chinese descent join in the festivities, but especially the African slaves and Indian indentured servants who were originally excluded from French plantation owners' carnival celebrations have created their own traditions. The big party starts the weekend before Ash Wednesday with steel band competitions and creative, often outlandishly costumed contestants vying to be the king and queen of carnival. Revelers stay out into the wee hours of Monday morning, eagerly awaiting the arrival of J'Ouvert at 4 a.m. In this predawn ritual, local folklore takes center stage as people dressed as devils, demons and monsters dance wildly through the streets to the rhythms of battling steel bands. For those with the stamina to party on, this gives way to ""Pretty Mas,"" in which vibrantly costumed revelers continue the dance party, jumping and gyrating to the soca music blasting from truck speakers. The celebrations and competitions last through Tuesday, with thousands of lavishly costumed bands and their affiliated masqueraders competing in an enormous parade. www.gotrinidadandtobago.com .","Mardi Gras falls on March 4 this year .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Personally, I like my pizza deliveryman to do one thing: bring me my dinner. But mention this guy to a group of women, and, while most of us will think of cheesy pies with tomato sauce, a good number of us will conjure up that hilariously bad porn cliché, the randy fellow who's always ready to accept sex in exchange for a medium sausage and mushroom. Some pornographers are marketing to women. Notwithstanding how lame the cliché is, or how simply bad most porn is (and after ten years as a professional reviewer of the stuff, I can report that much of it is very bad), the fact is, millions of women use and enjoy ""explicit sexual imagery."" What's perhaps more surprising, given the latest scientific research, is that more of us don't. In the first three months of 2007, according to Nielsen/NetRatings, approximately one in three visitors to adult entertainment Web sites was female; during the same period, nearly 13 million American women were checking out porn online at least once each month. Theresa Flynt, vice president of marketing for Hustler video, says that women account for 56 percent of business at her company's video stores. ""And the female audience is increasing,"" she adds. ""Women are buying more porn."" (They're creating more of it, too: Female director Candida Royalle's hard-core erotic videos, made expressly for women viewers, sell at the rate of approximately 10,000 copies a month.)  Watch man fired over porn-star wife » . Meanwhile, science is finally buying into the idea that women are at least as stimulated by porn as men. In a 2006 study at McGill University, researchers monitored genital temperature changes to measure sexual arousal and found that, when shown porn clips, men and women alike began displaying arousal within 30 seconds; men reached maximum arousal in about 11 minutes, women in about 12 (a statistically negligible difference, according to the study). Even more compelling were the results of a 2004 study at Northwestern University that also assessed the effect of porn on genital arousal. Mind you, a copy of ""Buffy the Vampire Layer"" and a lubed-up feedback device isn't most girls' idea of a hot night in. But when the researchers showed gay, lesbian, and straight porn to heterosexual and homosexual women and men, they found that while the men responded more intensely to porn that mirrored their particular gender orientation, the women tended to like it all. Or at least their bodies did. Oprah.com How to feel good naked . But that's the hitch: Even when our bodies respond to what we're seeing, not every woman feels empowered to enjoy the show. For years we've been told that we won't -- or shouldn't -- be turned on by porn, end of story, sleep tight. The message has come from all sides -- from conservative Christian organizations (""Traditionally, women are far more likely to engage in wistful, romantic fantasies than crude scenes of people engaging in sexual acts,"" Kathy Gallagher, cofounder of Pure Life Ministries, has written) to the radical feminist Catharine MacKinnon (who says porn exploits and discriminates against women, and encourages rape). When everyone tells you that what you might be curious about, or even secretly like, is wrong, bad, sleazy, and shameful, you don't have to cast a line very far to land a set of inhibitions. And, indeed, many a smart, strong, sexually self-reliant girl has popped in a porn DVD and ejected it just as quickly because she saw something that offended her or made her uncomfortable. I've heard from many women that they don't like the sense of being ""out of control"" they get from watching porn -- that disconnect between how their body is feeling and what their brain is telling them is acceptable. I like to remind these women that porn won't make you do anything you didn't already want to do before you pressed Play on the ""Edward Penishands"" DVD. Oprah.com: What you still don't know about sex . I've also heard, plenty of times, that porn degrades women. That argument always makes me wonder about gay male porn, which lots of women appreciate for all its hunky hotties in flagrante. If heterosexual porn degrades women, does gay porn degrade men? What about porn made by women -- is that degrading, too? For me, the real problem with most porn is its hokeyness -- the ridiculous costumes, the awful cinematography, the ludicrous story lines, the terrible acting (not to mention how scary the close-ups sometimes look, how fake the boobs are, how some starlets really sound like injured animals...). And yet in my research and experience, the biggest roadblock for women (and men) to enjoying explicit imagery is the fear that they don't ""stack up"" to the bodies and abilities of the people onscreen. Erotic models and actresses bring up a whole range of adequacy issues, from breast size to weight, from what you look like ""down there"" to the adult acne we all periodically fight. But it's worth remembering that if porn performers looked like you and me, they'd be out of a job. They're abnormally thin, they get cosmetic surgery literally (and sometimes frightfully) from head to toe, they have makeup in places you'd be surprised makeup can be applied, they shave and wax everything imaginable, and they're weirdly flexible. They occupy a tiny end of the gene pool, and that's why they're capable of acting out fantasy sex. Oprah.com: 5 secrets of the female orgasm . Though I've sometimes felt that my job as a porn reviewer (for Web sites like FleshBot.com) is akin to being a canary in a bad-taste boys' club mine shaft, I've seen a change in quality in the past few years that I think is a direct reflection of the growing female audience. As more discriminating viewers, we've demanded better porn -- and lo, it is being made. Women are changing the market. Director Maria Beatty's gorgeously shot movies (all of which feature strictly lesbian action) look like 1920s noir films with sex, but not explicit sex -- just a lot of tease and dreamy outfits and music. And Comstock Films, maker of high-quality, documentary-style, real-couples videos, aggressively markets to women with the simple tagline ""Women love real sex."" So just what do we love about it? First, the way it lets us satisfy our very normal, very human sexual curiosity. If you're like me, you're the kind of woman who'll peep at Pam Anderson's new boob job just to see the latest installations. But it's not just what the bodies look like, it's what they look like aroused -- and what they can do. Watching people have sex can be fascinating. Porn is also a fun and versatile toy. Sure, I sometimes feel like I need Google Earth to show me where the good porn is, but once I find it, I can figure out what to do with it faster than you can click Zoom In. Explicit sexual imagery is an aphrodisiac; it sends a direct current buzzing from our brains to our groins. Like a reliable vibrator, it can be a great tool. With porn, women like me get to experiment with making adult choices and trying on new fantasy ideas, just as we might try a different brand of condom for a change. We don't have to think of rationality and animalistic urges as mutually exclusive. If we desire, we can let them play together like tennis doubles. Porn is one more pleasure to add to life's sexual buffet, one that can be enjoyed with a partner or alone.

"(CNN)The passengers and crew aboard AirAsia Flight QZ8501 expected to land in Singapore at 8:30 a.m. on Sunday, after a flight of just over two hours. They departed Juanda International Airport in Indonesia's East Java early that morning, but amid increasingly bad weather one of the pilots requested to deviate from their planned route, AirAsia said in a statement. Although little is known about the aircraft's disappearance, the region has been struck by torrential rain -- which has some speculating that inclement weather could have played a role in the flight's disappearance . The plane was still traceable about five minutes before it disappeared, according to Indonesian state media. One minute before it lost contact, the pilot requested to raise the plane's flying altitude due to bad weather. CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis says that this maneuver could have been made in order to avoid turbulence. ""Turbulence doesn't bring an aircraft down,"" Maginnis said. ""It may be a pilot reaction to the turbulence. It may be perhaps it got too close to a thunderstorm. There could be so many variables."" It's unclear where the diversion took place, but CNN's aviation expert Richard Quest says that's where investigators' attention should focus. ""Bad weather per se does not bring down aircraft,"" he said. ""How the pilot may respond to bad weather could be an issue in this case."" AirAsia statement on missing airliner . Torrential rains . The region has been plagued by heavy rain and severe flooding in recent weeks -- something that the pilots should have been acutely aware of and trained to respond to, according to Maginnis. ""It is typical they would encounter monsoon weather,"" Maginnis said. ""They (the pilots) would have had monsoon training."" With around 8,000 flying hours between them, the pilots could be considered ""moderately experienced,"" Quest said. Tony Fernandes, the CEO and founder of AirAsia, told CNN's Andrew Stevens that the captain had 20,000 hours of flying experience, 7,000 of which were with AirAsia on the same model of plane that disappeared. Mary Schiavo, CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation, said weather can change quickly and there may have been little time to act. ""This weather system might have built up very quickly and they're on their own up there.

"(CNN) -- Reality show star and White House party-crasher Michaele Salahi has been asked to leave the television show ""Celebrity Rehab"" because she does not have an addiction, VH1 said in a statement. Salahi's manager shot back, saying the network knew that all along. Salahi and her husband made news in November 2009 after attending President Barack Obama's first state dinner without an invitation. VH1 said Tuesday it has canceled her appearance on the show, which chronicles celebrities undergoing treatment for alcohol and drug addictions. ""The treatment program that 'Celebrity Rehab' documents is intended for individuals with serious substance abuse and addiction issues,"" VH1 said in a statement Tuesday night. ""Prior to the taping of the current season, producers were advised that Michaele Salahi met the criteria to be treated in this setting. However, professional assessments spanning from that time to the present, found that she did not meet such criteria."" However, the show knew that in advance, according to Gina Rodriguez, her manager. ""That is the excuse they used. But they knew what it was when they cast her,"" Rodriguez said.

"(CNN) -- He is India's most successful Test match captain but Mahendra Singh Dhoni has decided enough is enough. The 33-year-old has retired from Test match cricket, bringing down the curtain on an illustrious career in which he thrilled crowds across the world. Dhoni, who made his debut in 2005, captained India in 60 of his 90 Test matches but decided to quit on Tuesday following the draw with Australia in Melbourne which meant his side conceded the series. In a statement, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), said that Dhoni made the decision to retire from Tests ""in order to concentrate"" on one-day and Twenty20 cricket. ""One of India's greatest Test Captains under whose leadership India became the No. 1 team in the Test Rankings MS Dhoni, has decided to retire from Test Cricket citing the strain of playing all formats of Cricket,"" said the statement. ""MS Dhoni has chosen to retire from Test Cricket with immediate effect in order to concentrate on ODI and T20 formats. ""BCCI while respecting the decision of MS Dhoni to retire from Test Cricket, wishes to thank him for his enormous contribution to Test Cricket and the laurels that he has brought to India."" The decision comes following a difficult year for Dhoni, who has been hampered by a succession of injuries. The wicket-keeper batsman missed five one-day games against Sri Lanka in November after suffering a hand injury, the same problem which forced him out of the opening Test against Australia earlier this month. That should not detract from a stellar career in which Dhoni has become India's highest earning sports star. According to Forbes, he is the fourth highest earning sportsman in the world, raking in $20 million in 2014, placing him ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo, Usain Bolt, Kobe Bryant and Lionel Messi. His decision comes just weeks ahead of the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand where India will defend its one-day crown. Dhoni will now start preparing for the tournament while Virat Kohli, one of the team's star batsmen, takes charge of the final Test match against Australia in Sydney which starts on January 6. Trailing 2-0 in the four match series, India required victory in Melbourne to keep the series alive. The draw meant that it was unable to overturn the deficit and slumped to yet another overseas defeat -- a recurring theme during Dhoni's reign. Since 2011, India has managed to win just two out of 22 away Tests and lost 13. During his 90-match Test career, Dhoni scored 4,876 runs at an average of 38.09, while his highest score of 224 came against Australia in February 2013. The wicket-keeper batsman also claimed 256 catches and made 38 stumpings. Dhoni replaced Anil Kumble as captain in 2008 after guiding India to victory in the very first World Twenty20 title the previous year. He enjoyed a hugely successful start to his reign, losing just one of 13 Test series and winning eight. That run allowed India to top the world rankings towards the end of 2009, a position in which it remained until 2011. But India has struggled for success outside of its own country in the Test match arena in recent times. This latest defeat by Australia comes on the back of similar results in England, New Zealand and South Africa. Last August, Dhoni hinted he may leave his role as captain after his side's 3-1 Test series defeat by England. When asked if he had taken his team as far as possible, he said: ""Maybe, yes. ""You'll have to wait and watch. If I'm strong enough or not strong enough, you'll have to wait and get the news."" India begins its defense of the World Cup title on February 15 against Pakistan in Adelaide. It will also face South Africa, West Indies, Zimbabwe, Ireland and United Arab Emirates in the group stages. Dhoni has excelled in the one-day game having made 250 appearances for India. He has scored 8,192 runs at an average of 52.85.","MS Dhoni has retired from Test cricket .

"The first man out the gate in the 2016 race for the White House is already facing scrutiny over payments his PAC made to his wife and daughter. A political action committee headed by Former Sen. Jim Webb, the Democrat who launched a presidential exploratory committee last month, has paid more than $90,000 to his wife and daughter since late 2006 -- with close to half of that amount doled out in 2014 alone, according to FEC filings. The information was first reported by Business Insider. A Webb spokesperson defended the expenses in an email to CNN, explaining that payments to Webb's wife and daughter increased in 2014 to a total of $37,000 to revamp Webb's personal website and create his 2016 exploratory committee page before he announced his plans to fundraise for a prospective presidential bid. ""Adding up numbers across several years for a sensational headline doesn't tell the story,"" the spokesperson said. ""The activities of the PAC increased in 2014 when Jim Webb decided to re-enter the political discussions of our country."" The spokesperson added that the payments were ""well within the law"" and ""much lower"" than typical compensation. Webb's daughter, Amy Webb Hogan, drew most of the disbursements, charging her father's PAC $24,000 in 2014 alone for ""administrative consulting services,"" which included administering, managing and designing the PAC's website, Sen. Webb's personal site and creating the Webb2016 website. Webb Hogan is the CEO of Webbmedia Group, a digital strategy firm based in Baltimore, though the payments from the PAC went directly to her. Sen. Webb's wife, Hong Le Webb, made $13,800 in 2014 for ""website services,"" which included ""vetting design consultants, negotiating contracts and content management,"" Webb's spokesperson said. She also received more than $1,000 in travel reimbursements from the PAC. Sen. Webb was also reimbursed $4,100 in travel expenses tied to an August 2014 trip to Iowa to campaign for candidates and meet prospective key supporters in the key primary state. The PAC has not spent any of its funds on donations to political candidates or groups since Oct. 2010, though it has continued to receive donations from supporters, according to FEC filings. And the payments to Webb's family amount to nearly 10% of all contributions the PAC received and only about 20% of donations to the PAC went to political candidates or groups, Business Insider reported. The Born Fighting PAC continues to accept donations online and the website now also links to Sen. Webb's 2016 exploratory committee website. Webb, a Marine Corps veteran, touted his bipartisan credentials and his military ties in a 14-minute video he posted last month announcing his intention to form an exploratory committee for 2016, which allows him to raise funds for a potential run and is typically the first step to formally announcing a presidential bid. If he does, Webb will likely face former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Democrats' primary process. Clinton is expected to announce a presidential bid next year.","Webb spokesperson explains 2014 .

"Bringing supplies to astronauts on the International Space Station can be a little screwy, leaving astronauts waiting for the next costly and risky resupply mission. This week, thanks to 3-D printing, astronaut and ISS commander Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore had a wrench he needed manufactured by a printer in just four hours. The ratcheting socket wrench was the first ""uplink tool"" printed in space, according to Grant Lowery, marketing and communications manager for Made In Space, which built the printer in partnership with NASA. The tool was designed on the ground, emailed to the space station and then manufactured. From start to finish, the process took less than a week. Made in Space's 3-D printer is the first to operate in zero gravity, and printed its first object in orbit -- a part for the printer, ironically -- in November. ""This means that we could go from having a part designed on the ground to printed in orbit within an hour to two from start to finish,"" Niki Werkheiser, NASA's 3-D print manager, said in a press release when the printer was sent to the ISS in September. ""The on-demand capability can revolutionize the constrained supply chain model we are limited to today and will be critical for exploration missions."" The goal for the project is to create in-space manufacturing, especially as missions venture farther from Earth. Space, the final frontier for 3-D printing . Ultimately, Lowery said the wrench and other objects will be sent back  to assess whether there are any functional differences between those samples printed in space versus those on the ground.","A wrench is first ""uplink tool"" designed on Earth then emailed and printed in space .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Meg Whitman, California's Republican nominee for governor, denied Thursday ever seeing a letter from the federal government questioning her former housekeeper's Social Security number. Whitman said she would be willing to take a polygraph test, to prove that she was ""really stunned"" to learn just last year that Nicky Diaz Santillan was an undocumented worker. Lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents Santillan, on Thursday released a copy of a 2003 letter from the Social Security Administration that she called ""the smoking gun or smoking document"" to prove Whitman knew her housekeeper was working illegally in the United States. Whitman, at a news conference an hour earlier, insisted she and her husband never saw such a letter. She said Santillan sorted their mail and ""might have been on the lookout for that letter."" The letter, shown to reporters Thursday afternoon, included a handwritten notation that Allred said was written by Whitman's husband, Dr. Griffith Harsh. ""Nicky Please check this Thanks,"" is scribbled at the bottom of the letter addressed to Whitman and her husband. Santillan kept the letter after Harsh gave it to her and the information requested by the Social Security Administration was not provided, Allred said. ""Now that we've shown you the evidence, let's see if she's going to deny it,""Allred said. Whitman, at a news conference a few miles away and an hour earlier, said she would take a polygraph test to prove she did not know her housekeeper was undocumented ""If it comes to that."" ""I would be delighted to do that,"" Whitman said. The allegations became public Wednesday when Allred held a news conference with Santillan to say the former housekeeper was ""exploited, disrespected, humiliated and emotionally and financially abused"" by the former eBay CEO. ""Make no mistake, these allegations are completely untrue they lack any merit whatsoever,"" Whitman said Thursday. Whitman called the charges a ""political smear"" orchestrated by her Democratic opponent, Jerry Brown. Allred said Thursday she has had no contact with the Brown campaign. The Whitman campaign gave reporters copies of immigration and IRS forms it said Santillan signed stating she was a legal resident of the United States when she first applied for employment as a housekeeper in 2000. Allred claimed that back in August 2000, Santillan ""was sent by an employment agency to interview with Meg Whitman for a job as a housekeeper. ... Nicky alleges that Ms. Whitman never asked if [she] was here legally,"" Allred said. ""The inconvenient truth of the hypocrisy of Meg Whitman as illustrated by her employment of an undocumented worker and her exploitation of her was going to be revealed, because Nicky wanted to be legalized,"" Allred said. ""Nicky was terminated in a sudden, cruel and heartless way,"" she added. Allred said Santillan intends to file a claim for unfairly denied wages. Whitman said she paid her housekeeper $23 an hour to work 15 hours a week. Sometimes, she said, Santillan worked fewer hours but was paid for more. While Whitman called Santillan like a member of her family, the housekeeper described a cold Whitman firing her for political reason. ""When I met with Meg Whitman on June 20, 2009, I asked her for assistance,"" Santillan said. ""I explained to her why I came to the United States. I explained that I was married and our economic situation in Mexico was very bad. We had no job, no food, no place to live and for that reason we made the decision to come here."" ""Ms. Whitman just laughed,"" Santillan said. Whitman, Santillan claimed, also blamed herself for failing to previously ask for any documentation. Whitman, according to Santillan, indicated four days later that she couldn't help the former housekeeper. ""She said, 'I cannot help you and do not say anything to my children. I will tell them you already have a new job and that you want to go to school and from now on, you don't know me and I do not know you. You have never seen me and I have never seen you. Do you understand me?'"" Allred also outlined what she said were abusive labor practices by Whitman, including not reimbursing the maid for mileage when she ran errands and not allowing her maternity leave. ""When Nicky indicated to Ms. Whitman in March 2005, that she needed to take a medical leave of absence for pregnancy, she alleges that she was told that unless she herself obtained someone to replace her, that her job might not be there for her when she returned."" Whitman denied the allegation, saying Santillan proposed the idea of having a friend fill in for her while she gave birth. While Santillan used her personal car to ""run a few errands,"" she never asked for mileage reimbursement, Whitman said. Whitman has previously beat back allegations she was involved in a 2007 shoving altercation with an employee at eBay's California headquarters after the Silicon Valley chief felt unprepared for an upcoming media interview. The incident reportedly led to a $200,000 settlement. Responding to the press conference, Whitman campaign lawyer Tom Hiltchak told reporters that, when hired in 2000, Santillan gave Whitman false documentation, including IRS forms, a Social Security card, a California drivers license, and Department of Justice immigration forms in which the stated she was in the United States lawfully. Whitman is currently neck and neck with Brown in the polls. The issue of immigration looms large in California, as in other states along the Mexican border. Whitman has come out against Arizona's controversial new anti-illegal immigration law, as well as California's controversial Proposition 187. However, she supports tough crackdowns on employers who hire illegal immigrants, requiring employers ""pay a fine and have their business license suspended for 10 days"" for first-time offenses, with steeper fines and penalties for repeat offenders.","NEW: Lawyer shows a 2003 letter she calls the ""smoking document""

"New York (CNN) -- A judge in Manhattan sentenced Faisal Shahzad to life in prison Tuesday for the botched Times Square car bombing, as the 31-year-old Pakistani-American defiantly warned in court to ""brace yourself, the war with Muslims has just begun."" ""The defeat of the U.S. is imminent, inshallah,"" Shahzad said during the sentencing. Inshallah means ""if God is willing."" Speaking in a 14th-floor courtroom with a view of Lower Manhattan and the area where the World Trade Center towers once stood, Shahzad said Muslims have been defending their people and their lands. If that makes them terrorists, ""then we will terrorize you,"" he said, imploring people to embrace Islam. U.S. District Judge Miriam Cedarbaum, who sentenced Shahzad to the mandatory sentence of life in prison, noted that he failed to show remorse for his actions. She also said that the sentence was an ""adequate deterrent to those inclined to follow the defendant and to protect the public against the crimes of this defendant."" White House spokesman Nick Shapiro noted the trial held in a civilian court effectively handled the case. Republicans have criticized the Obama administration for seeking to prosecute terrorists in civilian courts instead of military panels. ""We are pleased that this terrorist has been sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison, after providing substantial intelligence to our interrogators, and a speedy civilian trial,"" Shapiro said. ""His trial served no propaganda purpose for al Qaeda, and only underscored the strength of our justice system. The case shows once again how our values and the rule of law can keep us safe against those determined to do us harm on behalf of terrorist organizations overseas."" During Tuesday's sentencing, Cedarbaum asked Shahzad about swearing to defend Americans when he became a naturalized citizen. ""I swore but I didn't mean it,"" he said. Shahzad interrupted the judge's sentencing several times. He pointed to the ceiling and said ""Allahu akbar,"" or God is great, and he said he didn't care about the sentence. ""My sentence reflects life in this world, not life in the hereafter,"" he said. ""I'm happy with the deal that God has given me."" Saying he appears to be someone ""who is capable of education,"" she said she hopes he will spend time in prison thinking of whether the Quran wants you to kill people."" The Quran is Islam's sacred book. ""The Quran gives us the right to defend ourselves,"" he said. Cedarbaum said he has the right to appeal the sentence. Shahzad put his hands behind his back, and U.S. marshals cuffed him and led him out of court. The sentence drew immediate reaction in addition to the White House comment. Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, issued a statement saying the sentence was appropriate, calling Shahzad a ""remorseless terrorist who betrayed his adopted country."" Janice Fedarcyk, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York  office, said the sentence ""means Shahzad will never pose that threat again."" New York Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said, ""it's only right that Shahzad forfeit his freedom for life for having tried to forfeit the lives of New Yorkers forever."" U.S. Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-New York, said the sentence sends a clear message. ""Let this be a warning to others who would attempt to attack us: You will be caught; you will be held to account; and justice will be brought down upon you,"" Schumer said. Shahzad pleaded guilty in June to all 10 counts in an indictment against him. At the time, he told the court, ""I want to plead guilty 100 times because unless the United States pulls out of Afghanistan and Iraq, until they stop drone strikes in Somalia, Pakistan and Yemen and stop attacking Muslim lands, we will attack the United States and be out to get them."" Charges against Shahzad included attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, conspiracy and attempt to commit international terrorism, among others, authorities have said. Shahzad is accused of attempting to set off a vehicle bomb in Times Square on May 1, according to documents filed in federal court. Prosecutors said Shahzad carefully selected his location as a highly populated target and intended to strike again if he wasn't caught the first time. The bomb failed to detonate and he was arrested two days later while trying to leave the country on a flight bound for Pakistan from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. In a sentencing memo submitted to a federal court Wednesday, prosecutors painted a picture of a young man determined to target Americans on a large scale. According to the memo, Shahzad used webcams accessible on the internet ""as part of his effort to maximize the deadly effect of his bomb."" The memo says Shahzad found webcams online and studied the real-time video feeds of different areas in Times Square to determine when and where he could inflict the most damage. Prosecutors said Shahzad ""wanted to select the busiest time for pedestrian traffic in Times Square because pedestrians walking on the streets would be easier to kill and to injure than people driving in cars."" Federal prosecutors also contended in the sentencing memo that Shahzad believed the bomb would kill about 40 people and that he ""was prepared to conduct additional attacks until he was captured or killed."" According to the document, at the time of his arrest, Shahzad waived his Miranda rights and stated that ""if he had not been arrested he planned to detonate a second bomb in New York City two weeks later."" At a June court appearance, Shahzad admitted to receiving five days of weapons training in Waziristan, in Pakistan. Prosecutors said Shahzad spent 40 days beginning in December 2009 in the tribal region that straddles Pakistan and Afghanistan, where he lived with members of the Pakistani Taliban, or TTP. According to the court documents, he worked with an experienced bomb trainer affiliated with the TTP for five days. In addition, Shahzad was given $5,000 to help fund the mission and agreed to appear in a TTP video glorifying the planned attack. The roughly 40-minute video, according to its description in the memo, features Shahzad quoting from the Quran while the other side of the screen is filled with images of Times Square after the botched bombing. Toward the end of the video, the memo quotes Shahzad as saying, ""I have been trying to join my brothers in jihad every day since 9/11 happened. I am planning to wage an attack inside America.""","NEW: White House pleased with sentence and civilian court trial, a spokesman says .

"On April 2, CNN will report on the global impact, latest science and controversies related to autism for the first ""World Autism Day."" Watch for coverage on CNN.com and CNN TV. The parents of Hannah Poling, 9, sought damages after their daughter developed autism. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The parents of a 9-year-old girl with autism said Thursday that their assertion that her illness was caused by childhood vaccines has been vindicated by the federal government's decision to compensate them. ""We are very pleased with the government's decision,"" Hannah Poling's father, Dr. Jon Poling, a neurologist in private practice in Athens, Georgia, told reporters Thursday. ""It has been eight difficult and heartbreaking years since our daughter's injury."" A federal program intended to compensate victims of injuries caused by vaccines concluded last November that Hannah Poling's underlying illness that had predisposed her to symptoms of autism was ""significantly aggravated"" by the vaccinations she received as a toddler and that her family should therefore be compensated. How much the compensation should be has not been decided.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta discuss the Polings' views » . But public health officials quickly countered that the decision in no way supports the couple's claim. ""The government has made absolutely no statement indicating that vaccines are a cause of autism,"" said Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a conference call with reporters. ""This does not represent anything other than a very specific situation and a very sad situation as far as the family of the affected child."" Parents should continue to get their children immunized, she said: ""This is proven to save lives."" The decision by the Department of Health and Human Services' Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation had been sealed and was made available to the public only recently, when it was posted on an autism advocacy group's Web site. I-Report: Are you living with autism? Tell us your story . Hannah, who was born in December 1998, was ""precocious"" during her first 18 months, said her mother, Terry Poling. She said her daughter had been recruited in the spring of 2000 to participate as a peer in a program for children with disabilities. But within 48 hours after receiving nine routinely administered childhood vaccines in July 2000, the girl's health rapidly declined, she said. Terry Poling said her daughter stopped eating, failed to respond to verbal stimuli and became prone to episodes of screaming and high fever. Watch more from Terry Poling at the news conference . ""We knew something was wrong,"" said the registered nurse, who was then working as a trial attorney. More disturbing behavior followed, including staring at lights, running in circles, looking at fans -- all symptoms of autism, she said. ""When my husband saw this, his heart just broke,"" Terry Poling said. ""We knew that Hanna's beautiful, inquisitive mind wasn't coming back,"" said Dr. Poling, who gave up his job at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore for private practice, which offered him more time with this family. Terry Poling gave up her job as a trial attorney to take care of her daughter full time. Watch more from Terry Poling at the news conference » . That summer, Hannah did indeed participate in the early intervention program, but ""instead of being a peer that year, she was one of the multi-intensive needs children,"" Terry Poling said. In 2002, the couple filed their case with what is known as the vaccine court, alleging that the vaccines caused her autism. In addition, she was diagnosed with a disorder of the mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, Jon Poling said. The fact that his wife also has the disorder yet displays no signs of autism suggests that his daughter's symptoms are not genetically caused, he said.  Watch Dr. Jon Poling explain how Hannah's condition unfolded » . Instead, he said, Hannah's inborn mitochondrial problem may have been aggravated either by the vaccines or by the vaccine preservative thimerosal, which contains mercury, he said. Numerous studies have shown no link between illness and the vaccines, public health officials have long contended. In 2007, the case, which had been consolidated with other claims, was designated as a potential test case, said the Polings' lawyer, Cliff Shoemaker. But last fall, shortly before a deadline for expert testimony to be filed, the government conceded the link between the vaccines and the girl's injury and moved the case to the damages phase, he said. Though the family would be willing to make public the facts of the case, the rules of the court do not allow that, Shoemaker said. ""To the extent that their story is familiar to countless other families of autistic children, if this offers any hope or comfort to those parents, then they will be satisfied,"" he said about his clients. He noted that nearly 5,000 other autism claims are pending in the court, which was set up in the 1980s to pay for vaccine-related injuries. ""Our primary concern is our daughter's welfare,"" said Jon Poling, who added that he felt ""compelled to share information with all the other families out there who are wondering what this case means to them."" Shoemaker said his clients do not oppose vaccines. ""What we are all in favor of is safe vaccines,"" he said, calling for the removal of thimerosal from all vaccines. ""If there is any question or doubt, then it should not be there."" Thimerosal was removed from infant vaccines as a precaution following a 1999 agreement involving the Public Health Service, the American Academy of Pediatrics and vaccine manufacturers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Meanwhile, the Autism Omnibus Proceedings are expected to resume in May, with evidence about thimerosal. The CDC estimates one in 150 U.S. children is born with autism. The CDC, American Academy of Pediatrics, Institute of Medicine and other prestigious medical organizations maintain there is no known link between vaccines and autism. Studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine and elsewhere also have found no link. Even after thimerosal was removed from infant vaccines, the autism rate has continued to climb.

"Authorities expect to complete the autopsy Friday for a Colorado woman who went missing in Texas last month after traveling the world with her husband, police said. There will be no further updates in the case until the autopsy is complete, Garden Ridge, Texas, Police Chief Donna O'Conner said. Leanne Hecht Bearden had recently returned to the United States after 22 months crisscrossing the globe with her husband, Josh Bearden. Police said Thursday her life may have ended in the woods near a home in central Texas. The couple, who got married at the Denver Zoo and joked on their blog that they epitomized the adage ""opposites attract,"" had traveled with just carry-on backpacks to some of the world's most rugged locations. The couple's blog indicates they left in January 2012, traveling across the United States and visiting Canada before venturing on to Oceania, Asia, Africa, Europe and South America. The trip included stops in New Zealand, China, Singapore, Myanmar, Cambodia, India, Rwanda, Egypt, Serbia, Ukraine, Lithuania and Bolivia. Bearden documented trips to a Mount Everest base camp, the Dead Sea, an Indian wedding, Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's Victoria Falls and Serengeti, South America's Patagonia and Bolivia's salt flats. Authorities announced Thursday that a body believed to be the 33-year-old woman had been found in Garden Ridge, where she was last seen January 17 heading out from her in-laws' house for what was supposed to be a one-hour walk. Family members later confirmed her death, saying on a Facebook page dedicated to finding her that they were ""understandably devastated."" ""Leanne was a lovely and remarkable young woman,"" the family said, ""and we will all miss her greatly."" Just a few hours earlier Thursday, a post on the same page echoed the optimism and energy that had marked the family's efforts to find Bearden. ""DON'T LET UP!"" they urged all those who had joined them in looking for Bearden. ""We are still hopeful."" That hope was dashed after a phone call from a man to police around 12:15 p.m. (1:15 p.m. ET) Thursday, saying there was a body ""in a wooded area near his home in Garden Ridge,"" O'Conner said. O'Conner said responding officers ""located what we believe to be the body of Leanne Bearden."" ""We will reserve any information regarding the cause of death until an autopsy has been performed,"" the chief said. ""Our thoughts are with the Bearden and Hecht families, and (we) ask that you respect them in their time of grief."" The Beardens returned from their world travels in December, spending a short time in Georgia before heading to visit his family in Garden Ridge, just northeast of San Antonio, according to her brother Michael Hecht. Family: Strong possibility Bearden meant to leave . Coming back to her native country wasn't necessarily easy, her family suggested. ""The pressure of transitioning from her two-year trip back into what we consider 'normal' life seems to have left her very anxious and stressed,"" they said. After she went missing, relatives and friends worked intently to spread the word as the search for her -- on the ground and from the air, using helicopters -- expanded. One such search in January covered 23 acres. Garden Ridge police noted their concern about Bearden that month, while adding ""there is no indication at this time that (her disappearance) is criminal in nature."" Her family, meanwhile, acknowledged on Facebook that ""there is evidence that Leanne may have voluntarily left the area."" Whether or not that was true, the family pleaded for the public's help finding her given that -- for all her travels -- the 5-foot-3-inch Bearden ""is extremely vulnerable"" and ""her mental and physical status is uncertain."" ""We fear for her greatly,"" her family said.","Police chief says there will be no updates until after Friday's autopsy .

"Long lines formed at help centers and lawyers' office across America Wednesday as thousands of young, undocumented immigrants began applying for relief from deportation. They took advantage of one of the biggest immigration policy changes in years. An executive order by President Barack Obama allows those who entered the country illegally as children to remain and work without fear of deportation for at least two years. A crowd formed at Chicago's Navy Pier Wednesday to get help from  immigration lawyers and fill out forms. ""I was able to learn the customs and traditions, and I am used to living the life here,"" Nayeli Manzano, 16, told CNN affiliate WLS-TV. She arrived in the United States as a child from Mexico and said she is very much American. Faces of hope: Lining up for two more years in the U.S. ""I feel I am a citizen,"" she said. ""The only thing that is stopping me is a little piece of paper."" Tuesday, at a Latino community center in New York, Maria, a young Chilean, leaped from her seat. ""I've found the form!"" she screamed. She was with a number of other undocumented immigrants meeting there to get legal advice in anticipation of the release of the form, which authorities surprisingly posted a day before they had said they would. The form, titled ""Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,"" was dated August 15, 2012, and bore the expiration date of February 28, 2013. Maria started filling it out immediately, telling a reporter she was too afraid to divulge her last name or details of her childhood trek to the United States, but would feel differently once the form had been processed and her status ensured. Alejandro Mayorkas, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said applicants who have not committed major crimes can apply without fear of deportation. The forms were made available two months after Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that people who arrived in the United States as children may request consideration of deferred action for a period of two years subject to renewal, and upon approval would be eligible for work authorization. As many as 1.7 million youths may qualify for the program, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a project of the Pew Research Center. Dubbed Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the deferral program was created in June under an executive order signed by President Barack Obama. However, there is no guarantee of its future if Obama is not re-elected. Republican Mitt Romney would then have the power to revoke the order. The program also does not guarantee public benefits to successful applicants. That allowed Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer to issue an executive order Wednesday directing state agencies to deny benefits -- including driver's licenses -- to deferred action recipients. ""The program does not provide for any additional public benefit to unlawfully present aliens beyond the delayed enforcement of United States immigration laws and the possible provision of employment authorization,"" the executive order states. It says granting public benefits to deferred action recipients would have ""significant and lasting impacts"" on Arizona's budget, health care system and other taxpayer-funded benefits. Brewer's order drew immediate criticism from supporters of immigration reform and the DREAM Act, which would offer temporary legal status to young illegal immigrants who have graduated high school and want to attend college or join the military. Eventually, they could obtain permanent residency or citizenship. ""Gov. Brewer is directly attacking children and immigrant youth, who with no fault of their own, were brought to the United States,"" said the Arizona DREAM Act Coalition. The group organized a march to the State Capitol on Wednesday, carrying a large banner reading ""DREAM Act Now."" When he signed the deferred action order, Obama said the changes would make immigration policy ""more fair, more efficient and more just."" Undocumented students in their own words . The shift on the politically volatile issue of immigration policy elicited praise from Latino leaders, while Republicans reacted with outrage, saying the move amounts to amnesty -- a negative buzzword among conservatives -- and usurps congressional authority. ""This is not amnesty,"" Obama said. ""This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It's not a permanent fix. This is a temporary stopgap measure."" Mayorkas reiterated Tuesday that deferred action does not provide lawful status or a shortcut to permanent residency or citizenship. A $465 application fee will fund the administrative costs of the program, including a biometric check and the issuance of a secure work-authorization document, he said. Each request will be examined for possible fraud, he added. Ana Ramirez said her parents brought her and her sister, Juana, to the United States without any documentation many years ago when they were just toddlers. They were filling out the paperwork for the deferred action program in suburban Atlanta. I didn't have a choice to come here,"" Juana Ramirez said. Lawyer Charles Kuck said the young immigrants just want a chance at life without fear of deportation. ""They are getting two things out of this program: one, a promise they won't be deported for two years and, two, a work permit,"" Kuck said. ""In exchange, the federal government is getting a million or more kids coming forward, give their biographical information and that of their whole family and give their pictures."" He urged anyone applying to do so with the help of a lawyer. ""The government has said quite clearly: There will be no appeals. There will be no motions to reopen,"" he said. ""You get one bite at this apple."" In announcing the program, Obama noted that children of illegal immigrants ""study in our schools, play in our neighborhoods, befriend our kids, pledge allegiance to our flag. It makes no sense to expel talented young people who are, for all intents and purposes, Americans."" The president declared that the policy change is ""the right thing to do."" Under the new policy, people 30 and younger who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military, can get a two-year deferral from deportation and apply for work permits. Participants must prove they have been living in the country continuously for at least five years. The change is part of a department effort to target resources at illegal immigrants who pose a greater threat, such as criminals and those trying to enter the country now, Napolitano said. The move addresses a concern of the Latino community and includes some of the provisions of the DREAM Act, which failed to win enough Republican support to gain congressional approval. The name is an acronym for Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors. Obama has been criticized by Latino leaders for an overall increase in deportations of undocumented immigrants in recent years. Last year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 396,906 illegal immigrants, the largest number in the agency's history. Obama and Napolitano have called for Congress to pass the DREAM Act, which would put into law similar steps for children of illegal immigrants to continue living and working in the country. Republicans who blocked Democratic efforts to change immigration laws have condemned the move, with some calling it an improper maneuver to skirt congressional opposition. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, a GOP foe of Democratic proposals on immigration, threatened in June to sue to stop Obama ""from implementing his unconstitutional and unlawful policy."" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has called the decision ""a classic Barack Obama move of choosing politics over leadership,"" while House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, has called the change a ""decision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants."" Others predicted the move will tighten an already poor job market for young Americans. However, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who sponsored the DREAM Act, said it ""will give these young immigrants their chance to come out of the shadows and be part of the only country they've ever called home."" Presumed GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney said in June that the issue needs more substantive action than an executive order, which can be replaced by a subsequent president. As president, Romney said, he would seek to provide ""certainty and clarity for people who come into this country through no fault of their own by virtue of the actions of their parents."" Latinos make up the fastest-growing immigrant population in the country, and the Latino vote is considered a crucial bloc for the November presidential election. A spokeswoman for a major Latino group, the National Council of La Raza, hailed the administration's move. ""In light of the congressional inaction on immigration reform, this is the right step for the administration to take at this time,"" NCLR spokeswoman Laura Vazquez said in June.

"A father in Daytona Beach, Florida, called 911 early Friday morning to report that when he found someone sexually abusing his 11-year-old son, he beat the assailant until he was ""nice and knocked out"" for police to apprehend. So far, the father is not facing any charges. CNN affiliate CFN 13 asked Daytona Beach Police Chief Michael Chitwood whether he had any issue with the father's reaction Friday. Chitwood responded, ""Not as a police chief and not as a father."" The father's identity and that of his son were not released  to protect the identity of the minor as an alleged sexual abuse victim. The father, who sounds collected but enraged during the 911 call, told Volusia County emergency dispatch that 18-year-old Raymond Frolander was close to the family and was in the apartment while the father was out. The father says that when he got home, the look on Frolander's face made him think something was wrong. The father says Frolander's pants fell down to his ankles ""and nothing else needed to be said"" when he saw exposed genitals. According to the charging affivadit, the 11-year-old victim told authorities that Frolander had performed oral sex on him and instructed the boy to fondle him. The document says the boy told authorities that Frolander began abusing him a few years ago. It also says Frolander told police, ""I'm guilty."" When the 911 dispatcher asked the father whether he used weapons to knock out Frolander, the father told the dispatcher, ""my fist and my foot."" The father explained that Frolander was breathing, but not speaking, ""in a puddle of blood"" on the floor ""and I loved him up until 15 minutes ago."" At times, the dad is heard talking to the suspect, at one point saying, ""You are damn lucky, boy, that I love my God."" When Daytona Beach police officers arrived, according to the charging affidavit, they saw Frolander ""laying motionless on the living room floor with several knots on his face and bleeding from his mouth."" He was treated and released from a hospital before he was questioned. Frolander faces a charge of sexual battery of a child and was in the Volusia County Jail late Friday. He had no bond. CNN could not determine whether he had an attorney. Chitwood said that the 18-year-old was like a family member to the boy, ""and the father acted as a father should act."" Chitwood told CFN 13 that it's not unusual for young victims to be afraid to report sexual abuse because they feel threatened or fear that they will get in trouble.","A man in Daytona Beach, Florida, said he caught someone sexually abusing his son .

"Stop judging the California woman who walked away from her alleged captor after a decade, an angry and emotional Michelle Knight told CNN's ""New Day"" on Friday. ""Unless you were walking in her shoes, you have no reason to talk, none at all,"" said Knight, one of three women freed from years of brutal captivity in a Cleveland home in 2013. Knight was referring to the case of a California woman who approached police after contacting her sister on Facebook, saying -- according to police -- that she had been abducted by her mother's boyfriend at 15, then raped, beaten and forced to marry her alleged captor, Isidro Garcia. In the days since the woman's story came to light, Garcia's attorney and some of her neighbors in the Bell Gardens neighborhood where she lived with Garcia and their 3-year-old child have questioned the abduction story, saying she appeared to be happy and well cared for. ""She never showed a sad face or worried face,"" said a neighbor who identified herself only as Erika. ""She had plenty of time to actually escape so it's hard to believe this is really going on because she had a lot of free time."" Authorities have acknowledged that the woman said she reached out to her family before she went to police. A photo posted on Facebook purports to show her with her mother and sister on on Mother's Day -- one week before she went to authorities. A post in Spanish that accompanies the photo on Facebook reads: ""After almost 10 years after not seeing my mom and little sister."" CNN cannot confirm the date of the photo, and police and the prosecutor's office declined Friday to comment further on the details of the case. Garcia's attorney, Charles Frisco, said Friday he hasn't had much time to talk to his client but said stories such as the neighbor's make him doubt the state's case. ""If you listen to what they have to say, it sounds like he's not guilty and it's all fabricated,"" Frisco told CNN. Knight has just one answer to those doubting the woman's story: You couldn't possibly understand. ""Just because you're not chained up and you're not locked in the basement doesn't mean you ain't trapped,"" she told CNN's Kate Bolduan. ""I know exactly what it feels like to be trapped in your own mind, your emotional mind, and told you can't do anything about it, nobody will care about what you say."" Knight was held in Ariel Castro's Cleveland home from August 2002 until May 2013, when her fellow captive Amanda Berry summoned help from a neighbor to break out of the locked house. Sometimes chained, frequently brutalized, Knight said the worst part of her decade of captivity was the isolation and the psychological manipulation her captor held over her. ""I was threatened to be killed. I was threatened that nobody cared about me,"" she said. ""For a girl like her, the emotional torture is so painful that she chose not to hurt other people,"" Knight said. ""Because he may have threatened to hurt her, he may have threatened to hurt the people that she was talking to."" Elizabeth Smart, who also was abducted, had a similar message in an interview Thursday with Chris Cuomo on ""New Day."" ""Well, as a survivor who has been chained up in physical chains and also had the chains of threats held over me, I can tell you firsthand that threat is so much stronger than physical chains,"" said Smart, who was abducted from her Salt Lake City home in 2002. ""Now, I don't have intimate details on what threats he was holding over her head, but I understand that he was holding her family, that he was threatening her family and, for me, that was the strongest threat anyone could have ever made to me,"" she said. Knight said she worries that questions such as those raised about the California woman's case will keep other people suffering from abuse from coming forward and seeking help. ""You're making people not want to come out, not want to say anything,"" she said, her voice breaking. ""You're making people want to sit there and keep it to themselves and go through the abuse when you say stupid crap like that."" The California woman's alleged captor, Garcia, 42, was arrested during a traffic stop Wednesday. He is charged with a felony count of forcible rape, three felony counts of lewd acts on a minor and a felony count of kidnapping to commit a sexual offense. If convicted of all three crimes, he could face life in prison.","A photo purports to show the woman with her mom a week before she went to police .

"Wander the historic streets of the Bahian capital of Salvador, and you're never far from one of the region's most moving traditions: its powerful rhythms. Whether it's the local axe pop music powered by freight-train percussion or street musicians and blocos afro pounding out hypnotic riffs, big beats power Bahia in a way they do nowhere else in Brazil, maybe even the world. A state on Brazil's coast, Bahia is the center of the country's Afro-Brazilian culture, and the heartbeat of that is the drum. The state is home to percussion ensembles such as Ile Aiye and Olodum, a group of several thousand members famed for their work with Paul Simon, that make Carnival in Salvador one of the top attractions in Brazil. Percussionist Carlinhos Brown rose from drumming on empty water bottles in the streets of a poor neighborhood in Salvador to become one of Brazil's top hit makers and artists, not to mention a judge on ""The Voice Brasil."" Brown founded the mostly percussion band Timbalada, a Carnival favorite, which takes its name from the conical hand drum known as a timbal. Saude! Ice-cold caipirinhas in Bahia . Brash bashers . ""From the time kids here are very young, they play drums,"" says Gabi Guedes, one of Bahia's top percussionists. Guedes has played with fellow Bahiano Gilberto Gil and Margareth Menezes, as well as Jamaican reggae legend Jimmy Cliff, and is a member of Orkestra Rumpilezz, a 20-piece Afro-Brazilian group. ""You hear all sorts of percussion growing up, all kinds of samba, samba afro, samba de roda,"" says Guedes. ""All this music is connected to the drum. It's in the blood. It's passed down from the grandfathers."" Like their grandfathers, Bahia's modern musicians are known for a brash style that mixes rhythms from around Brazil and the Caribbean. The hyperkinetic music style known as axe (pronounced ""AH-shay""), which blends speed-pop with fiery Afro-Brazilian percussion, has produced pop superstars such as Ivete Sangalo, Daniela Mercury and Claudia Leitte. Samba reggae is another made-in-Bahia style that bends rhythmic traditions in a popular way. ""Bahia is a rhythmic laboratory,"" says Chris McGowan, co-author of ""The Brazilian Sound: Samba, Bossa Nova and the Popular Music of Brazil"" and a just-released ebook of interviews with top Brazilian artists of the MPB (Musica Popular Brasileira) and bossa nova era, ""The Brazilian Music Book."" ""It's a place where Afro-Brazilian rhythms and the latest sounds coming from the Caribbean and elsewhere are mixed together to create new danceable hybrids,"" says McGowan. ""Samba, ijexa, reggae, rock, merengue, lambada, soca, salsa, zouk and other styles are energetically shaken and stirred together."" Godly beats . Drums are also at the heart of the Afro-Brazilian religious tradition of Candomblé, which blends African beliefs with Catholic influences and has its origins in Salvador, where the first Candomblé terreiro (house of worship) was founded. Candomblé is widely practiced in Bahia and has followers throughout Brazil. In worship ceremonies, devotees commune with deities known as orixas through dance, chants, offerings and music rituals in which drumming plays a prominent role. The beat of tall, conga-like drums, and atabaques, a conical hand drum that comes in three sizes, calls forth the deities and creates a trance-like mood for encountering the divine. ""The drum is very powerful to bring the orixas close to us,"" says Guedes, ""and to help us worship them."" Guedes got his percussion training as a youth in the Gantois house of Candomblé, where he lived and studied with the most famous head priestess of Candomblé, Mae Menininha, celebrated in songs by pop icons Caetano Veloso and Dorival Caymmi and whose fans included the writer Jorge Amado. Bloc parties . Candomblé also figures in another percussion-oriented tradition in Bahia, afoxe, a procession that brings Candomblé music, songs and rhythms into the streets. Afoxe groups march to the beat of an ijexa rhythm tapped on atabaques, gongues (a double-bell agogo) and a gourd shaker familiar to African music also called afoxe. The most famous afoxe group, the Filhos de Gandhy, began parading at Carnival in the late 1940s, inspired by the nonviolence of Mahatma Gandhi. During Carnival in Brazil, people who aren't part of their city's featured parade form their own neighborhood groups, or blocos, so everyone can get in on the celebration. In the 1970s, a tradition of blocos afro, all Afro-Brazilian drumming groups, developed in Bahia, led by a bloco called Ile Aiye. Over the years Ile Aiye has grown to a couple thousand members, blazing a percussion trail of thundering bass drums (surdos) and tenor drums (repiques) with powerful songs about African roots and black pride. Today, the best-known bloco afro is Olodum, originally an all-percussion group based in the historic heart of Salvador in the Pelourinho district. The group has recorded a number of successful albums and touched off the samba-reggae style of music so popular in Bahia and across Brazil. If you're in Brazil and want to get closer to the real Bahian experience, the path is easy to find: Just follow the beat.","A state on Brazil's coast, Bahia is the center of the country's Afro-Brazilian culture .

"(CNN) -- In March, single mother Shanesha Taylor, destitute and effectively homeless, was arrested on charges of leaving her children in her car during a 40-minute job interview. The children were unharmed, but Taylor then faced two counts of third-degree felony child abuse -- charges that sparked outrage across the country. It sparked outrage with me as well, and I've worked with Taylor's attorney to help handle the media attention surrounding the case. My involvement in the story opened my eyes to a number of cases where parents have been arrested for behavior that, just a generation ago, may have raised eyebrows but would certainly not have risen to the level of criminal charges. For example: In a split decision this month, an appellate court in Florida upheld the conviction of Jovita Ibeagwa, who served a year in jail for two counts of aggravated manslaughter of a child following the drowning deaths of her children, aged 6 and 3. Ibeagwa left her children unsupervised while she went to work at her second-shift job. During that time, her children tragically drowned in a neighbor's pool. Debra Harrell, a South Carolina mother, found herself under arrest this month when a bystander discovered her 9-year-old daughter playing in the park alone. Harrell had been allowing the girl to play there while she worked at a McDonald's a mile and a half away. Here are some more recent examples: . In North Carolina, a mother was arrested after leaving her 5- and 11-year-olds alone for 2Â½ hours. A Connecticut mother was arrested when her 7-year-old, who wasn't wearing a helmet, suffered head injuries after falling off his scooter. In Pennsylvania, a mother died in jail while serving a 48-hour sentence after she couldn't pay fines incurred for the truancy of some of her seven children. In Ohio, a father was arrested when his 8-year-old gave the church bus the slip and played with neighborhood friends instead of going to youth group. And then just this week, a mother in Florida was arrested after allowing her 7-year-old to walk half a mile to a neighborhood park. The boy even had a cell phone to call home if he got into trouble. What's going on here? From one perspective, we're criminalizing poverty. Some of the parents I mentioned above clearly acted out of economic necessity. In our post-recession economy, good jobs are hard to come by and child care is expensive. For low-wage earners, child care costs can easily eclipse earning potential. In Taylor's case, she had previously been offered a full-time job, but child care costs would have left her with less income than she was able to earn by picking up a few hours here and there. A news report in the Harrell case quoted another parent who said, ""I understand the mom may have been in a difficult situation, not having someone to watch the child, but at the same time, you've got to find somebody."" It sounds as though she is suggesting that having some unqualified person to stay home alone with the daughter would somehow be better than letting her play in the park, surrounded by other children and parents. I'm not a parent, but I am a board-certified family law attorney, and I frequently deal with families facing difficult decisions. The truth is that too many parents are finding themselves having to make a desperate choice between providing for their children and caring for their children. Unless you've been put in that situation, I don't think you're entitled to judge. I grew up in Queens in the '60s -- during a time when crime in New York was notoriously on the rise. My father was a battalion chief for the New York Fire Department, and he worked two other jobs to support our family. My mother worked hard to keep my two sisters, my two brothers (and me) in line. She was an amazing mother but didn't always succeed in keeping us out of hot water. We were allowed to play unsupervised in our neighborhood, and sometimes we got in trouble. But my mother knew we were with other neighborhood kids. She knew other adults in our neighborhood kept tabs on us and would look out for us. She expected that if we got into real trouble, we'd encounter a police officer, and that officer would deliver us home -- and it did happen from time to time. I'm concerned that in the average neighborhood today -- where the crime rate is far lower than it was in the 1960s -- adults are not looking out for neighborhood kids. Instead of helping a youngster who may be in trouble, they're calling the cops. And the police, instead of bringing children home, they're handing them over to child services and arresting the parents. Last week, prosecutors offered Taylor a deal: After she completes a parenting plan, which includes six months of counseling, they will drop the felony charges. But Taylor now has to fight to regain custody of her children. In South Carolina, Harrell has been reunited with her daughter but still faces criminal prosecution, and she lost her job as a result of the arrest. In Florida, Ibeagwa is out of jail now -- after suffering the double tragedy of losing her children and enduring incarceration for her role in the misfortune. Elsewhere other children are being taken from their parents, and families are being torn apart. I have to wonder if my mom, who I think was a wonderful mother, would face criminal charges if she were alive and raising children in today's world -- if she raised them the way she raised my brothers and sisters and me.","Mark O'Mara: In March, homeless mom arrested after leaving kids in car during job interview .

"(CNN) -- While the world watched the historic landing of a space probe on a comet 310 million miles from Earth, many were distracted by what was happening closer to home. Rosetta Project scientist Matt Taylor caused a firestorm with his choice of fashion during the European Space Agency's live stream of Wednesday's Philae landing. Taylor initially sported a shirt featuring women in lingerie, possibly not the wisest choice of attire given all of the discussion surrounding the challenges for women in the tech and science fields. ""The fact that a scientist of any gender, but especially a man, would think it's a good idea to wear a shirt covered in naked women while representing a major space agency and a significant research project is appalling; and clearly, he had no idea that he was engaging in exactly the kind of casual sexism that drives women away from STEM,"" S.E. Smith wrote in an article on XOJane. STEM is the acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and women in those disciplines have long complained of sexism and other difficulties in their male-dominated fields. The shirt quickly spawned its own hashtag on Twitter -- #shirtstorm -- as both sexes took Taylor to task. ""No no women are toooootally welcome in our community, just ask the dude in this shirt,"" tweeted The Atlantic tech writer Rose Eveleth. ""I don't care what scientists wear. But a shirt featuring women in lingerie isn't appropriate for a broadcast if you care about women in STEM,"" tweeted astrophysicist Katie Mack. ""You think a shirt like this makes women feel welcome? I don't,"" Mack added when another Twitter user questioned whether she was going too far. Smith wrote that the shirt was sexist and that ""The people who were upset by it weren't just those silly oversensitive feminists who can't take a joke. Scientists from all perspectives were unimpressed with the shirt, both on professional grounds and gendered ones. "" Taylor has been one of the most public faces of the mission and is known as an unconventional scientist. He sports tattoos all over his arms and, in honor of the Rosetta mission, got some new ink in January: a drawing of the space probe landing on the comet. During a recent Wall Street Journal Facebook Q&A, Taylor was asked about whether tattooed men can achieve greatness and said, ""The people I work with don't judge me by my looks but only by the work I have done and can do. Simple."" Taylor reportedly changed out of the shirt during the live stream. On Friday, he made an emotional apology during another live stream about the mission. ""The shirt I wore this week, I made a big mistake, and I've offended many people, and I am very sorry about this,"" Taylor said before wiping his eyes. We can land on a comet, but we can't ...","NEW: Scientist Matt Taylor apologizes for shirt .

"Your first view of Kamilo Beach on Hawaii's Big Island is of majestic rock, postcard-worthy waves and miles of uninhabited beach. But look closer at the sand and you see specks of blue, yellow and white plastic. A piece of a bottle cap. A corner of a milk crate. Half a toothbrush. Kamilo Beach is part of the devastating legacy of the March 2011 Japan tsunami. ""It's disheartening to come out here and see all this marine debris in an area that's otherwise so remote, debris that's washing up from other countries,"" said Megan Lamson, debris project coordinator for the Hawaii Wildlife Fund. Hawaii is in a unique geographical spot, the center of the Pacific Ocean, to witness the impact of the Japan tsunami. Debris swirls from Asia to the continental United States through Hawaii. The islands are, in effect, a comb of the Pacific. The nonprofit Hawaii Wildlife Fund said marine debris has been a problem for years for the island state and tsunami debris has made things worse. According to Japan, 1.5 million tons of tsunami debris floated away. The wildlife fund organizes beach cleanups along Hawaii's  shorelines and struggles to keep up with the marine debris, made up primarily of plastic. Lamson pulled out part of a beer crate that read ""Exclusively for Kirin Beer"" in Japanese. She also found a Suntory Whisky bottle stamped ""Japan."" Lamson also found a small vitamin drink container with Japanese text. Since fall, the wildlife fund and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have found refrigerators, freezers, buoys and even an intact fishing boat, all with Japanese text. But most disturbing to Lamson are a couple of soft plastic bottles with bite marks. ""Marine life in the ocean are mistaking plastic for their natural food,"" Lamson said. Lamson may suspect it, but Lesley Jantz, a NOAA fishery biologist with the observer program, can confirm it. Jantz has been studying the impact of marine debris in fish. In her lab, Jantz sliced open the stomach of a lancetfish for CNN. You may never have heard of the lancetfish, a sometimes 4- to 6-foot long fish with enormous teeth. But bigeye and yellow fin tuna eat lancetfish. Tuna ends up on our plates. Jantz pulled out a 12 by 12 piece of indigestible black plastic. ""It would be difficult to pass through the system,"" said Jantz. ""I've found several fish with the same black plastic bag, just like this, even larger. If it gets to a certain size, the fish is going to feel like it's full."" Jantz conducted a study that included 64 fish of varying species. Twelve percent of them, she said, contained plastic. When she looked just at lancetfish, 45% had plastic. ""One concern that we have and don't know is if any chemicals from the plastic are absorbed into the tissue of the fish, which is a problem if consumed by a fish that we consume. That's definitely the next step, what is the impact?"" Across the island in David Hyrenbach's lab, the impact of plastic debris is apparent among the animal species he studies: birds. Hyrenbach cut open the bellies of some albatross for CNN. Plastic pieces spilled out of the belly of a 2-month-old albatross. Eighty percent of the stomach was packed with plastic. Hyrenbach, an assistant professor of oceanography at Hawaii Pacific University, pulled out a small bottle top. ""Toothpaste top?"" he said. ""No, cap of a medicine tube."" He reached into the stomach again. ""Oh, it's a brush, you see?"" There were the unmistakable bristles of a hairbrush. ""Morally, this is terrible. How is this possible? Majestic, far ranging, beautiful birds, in a pristine place of the pacific, the northwest Hawaiian islands, you open them up and this is what you find,"" said Hyrenbach. He grabbed a box, packed with toy soldiers, lighters and brushes. He explained that he pulled all the items out of albatross from Hawaii. ""Every bird I looked at had plastic. Some had a little bit. Some had a lot. Everybody we looked at had plastic."" NOAA said most of the debris affecting the island cannot be tracked to any particular country, even Japan, because the plastic is often so weathered and broken by the time it hits Hawaii. ""We don't really know the full impact of this type of debris. It adds to an existing problem that we have across the world,"" said NOAA Pacific Islands Regional Coordinator Carey Morishige. ""But it is quite eerie to see an item you think may have come from Japan, someone's home, to sit on a beach thousands of miles away. It brings home the fact beyond the marine debris issue this is first and foremost a human tragedy."" It should serve as a reminder, Morishige said, that ""the land and the oceans are incredibly connected.""","Debris apparently from 2011 Japan tsunami is washing ashore in Hawaii .

"Ten years after the Transportation Security Administration started a program to spot terrorists by observing passenger behavior, the agency has spent more than $900 million on the program but has yet to prove its effectiveness, congressional overseers say. And Congress risks wasting more money if it continues funding the program without scientific proof that it works, the Government Accountability Office said in a report. The report is the most critical yet pitting the GAO critics against the TSA, which has long believed that trained observers can pick out people who pose a threat to aviation by looking for signs of stress, fear or deception. The agency has deployed an ever-increasing number of so-called behavior detection officers, calling them a ""vital component"" of its security program. Read the report . In fiscal 2011 and 2012, about 3,000 such officers were deployed to 176 major airports nationwide, where they observed about 1.3 billion people, the report says. The GAO said TSA tests of the program were flawed, and decades of published research on behavior detection ""also draw into question the scientific underpinnings"" of the program. Those studies show that the ability of trained observers to detect deceptive behavior is ""the same as or slightly better than chance."" But the TSA defends the program, saying security would be damaged if money is cut. ""Behavior detection techniques have been an accepted practice for many years within the law enforcement, customs and border enforcement, defense, and security communities both in the United States and internationally,"" the TSA wrote in a response to the GAO. Under the program, uniformed behavior detection officers scan passengers in line and engage them in brief verbal exchanges, identifying passengers who exhibit certain behaviors. Different behaviors are assigned point values, and if a passenger exceeds a point ""threshold,"" they are referred to secondary screening, where they undergo a pat-down and search of their personal property, while officers continue to look for behavioral clues. If another threshold is passed, or if fraudulent documents are discovered, the behavior detection officer refers the passenger to a law enforcement officer for further investigation. The law enforcement officer may choose to allow the passenger to proceed or could question the passenger further. The initial observation takes less than 30 seconds, but the lengthier screening takes an average 13 minutes, and referrals to police can take longer, according to an outline of the process in the GAO report. ""The report released today by GAO displays what I have been saying for years -- that TSA's (detection) program is fundamentally flawed, cannot be proven effective, and should no longer be funded with taxpayers dollars,"" Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, said in a written statement. Thompson, the ranking Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said he will question TSA Administrator John Pistole about the report at a hearing Thursday.

"(CNN) -- No, not all men channel frustration over romantic rejection into a killing spree. But yes, all women experience harassment, discrimination or worse at some point in their lives. That's the message at the core of an ongoing Twitter conversation that emerged after a rampage last week that left six students from the University of California, Santa Barbara, dead and wounded 13 others. Elliot Rodger, who apparently shot and killed himself, left behind a robust digital footprint detailing his plan to ""destroy everything I cannot have,"" blaming the ""cruelness of women"" for leading to his ""day of retribution."" His comments inspired Twitter users to tweet the hashtag #YesAllWomen: They shared examples of what ""women must fear"" even if ""not all men"" engage in those behaviors, according to the person believed to have created the hashtag Saturday. The person did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The hashtag -- a response to the ""not all men"" defense sometimes used to deflect feminist arguments -- spread quickly on Twitter, zeroing in on the subtle and explicit signals that a woman's worth is based on her availability to men. By Tuesday morning, #YesAllWomen had been tweeted more than 1 million times. Expanding the conversation . #YesAllWomen is the latest Twitter hashtag to draw attention to violence against women in a global conversation that has spread from social media to college campuses and into the White House. While most feminist-driven Twitter campaigns preach to the choir, #YesAllWomen has succeeded in drawing the mainstream -- including men -- into the conversation, feminist writer and political analyst Zerlina Maxwell said. More unique is the conversation's focus on misogyny and its negative impact on women and men, Maxwell said, pointing to tweets from men as evidence. There was backlash to the hashtag's sentiment, too. Some challenged the idea that misogyny was behind Rodger's killing spree, while others argued against the broader idea that most women face gender-based harassment. But those tweeting #YesAllWomen interpreted backlash as evidence to prove their points. #YesAllWomen's forebears include #everydaysexism, which evolved from the website Everyday Sexism. In 2011, the site launched as a place for people to share stories of gender-based harassment. Today, #everdaysexism exists as a continuous feed of examples of street harassment, and as an occasional rallying cry around petitions. It has been tweeted more than 520,000 times in the past year, according to social Web search engine Topsy. Earlier this year, Maxwell started #rapecultureiswhen in response to a Time.com op-ed calling for an end to ""rape culture hysteria."" The hashtag highlighted examples of victim blaming and was tweeted more than 67,000 times. With more than 1.2 million tweets so far, #YesAllWomen has far outpaced both hashtags, according to Topsy. It has drawn comments from celebrities such as Kerry Washington, Neil Gaiman and Patton Oswalt. Celebrity boost aside, #YesAllWomen's universal appeal springs from ""bottom-up"" personal stories instead of a single omniscient voice in an op-ed, Maxwell said. ""It's not somebody on high saying this is a problem in society and everyone should fix it,"" she said. ""It's people talking about real experiences, and each experience is validated by the next."" More than Internet slacktivism . Even though #YesAllWomen grew as a counterpoint to the ""not all men"" argument, it's effective because it stands on its own, feminist media critic Rachel Sklar said. In fact, Rodger's killing spree shows that men can also be victims of hostility toward women: Four men were among those killed, including his two roommates, ""the biggest nerds I had ever seen,"" Rodger said. Rodger left behind a 137-page ""manifesto"" in which he wrote, ""I've wanted love, affection, adoration. You think I'm unworthy of it. That's a crime that can never be forgiven."" ""I don't know what you don't see in me. I'm the perfect guy and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men instead of me, the supreme gentleman,"" Rodger said in a YouTube video posted the day of the killings. Sklar said his words echoed sentiments voiced by men's rights activists in online forums and social media platforms, especially Twitter. Those murmurs rarely turn deadly, she said, but Rodger's actions represent every woman's worst fears. ""It's been a collective trigger for women. It's an extreme case of something we see and experience regularly as part of our lives, but it's shocking and jarring and scary to see it taken to these lengths,"" said Sklar, who founded the women's network TheLi.st. Despite its grim origins, #YesAllWomen advanced conversation around issues that dominate feminist circles, feminist writer Soraya Chemaly said. The hashtag sparked more discussion about rape in India and Africa, and college campus sex assault in the United States. The hashtag also forced discussion of the intersection of mental illness and misogyny in violence against women, especially in mass shootings, which are overwhelmingly perpetrated by white men. ""I don't know how anyone can look at this information and not see how densely matrixed all these factors and events are,"" Chemaly said. ""We keep seeing this pattern repeated and people seem to think misogyny or mental illness are exclusive or need to be prioritized."" While there's no tangible outcome to the hashtag's spread, those involved said it's far from the typical slacktivism. It created a virtual space for women to share their stories, Chemaly said. ""While there's a lot of harm that can happen online, the Internet (has been) so fundamentally transformative for women and feminists,"" she said. ""Women who were isolated in their experiences by culture and their families for the first time can exceed those boundaries.""","Elliot Rodger's misogynistic rants inspired #YesAllWomen Twitter conversation .

"The scandal over allegations about NSA surveillance overseas, including monitoring of the cell phone conversations of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and millions of phone calls in France, is another huge blow to President Barack Obama. The news has caused a big uproar in Western Europe, with Merkel demanding a response from Washington. It was ""incredible that an allied country like the United States and at this point goes as far as spying on private communications that have no strategic justification,"" said Jean-Marc Ayrault, the Prime Minister of France. ""Trust needs to be rebuilt,"" Merkel said. While observers warn these complaints are hypocritical and have more to do with domestic politics in Western Europe than true feelings about the United States, this incident is nonetheless much more than a mere blip in the time line of Obama's presidency. The recent National Security Agency revelation is one more step in a series of revelations about practices that have undercut a central promise that candidate Obama made in 2008 -- to repair America's standing in the world. When Obama took office, America's position in the global community had greatly deteriorated. President George W. Bush's war in Iraq, and his unilateral approach to foreign policy, had generated tremendous distrust and anger overseas, including among our closest allies. So, too, had Bush's apparent disregard for civil liberties and willingness to ignore international standards against the use of torture. The United States was seen as a country that acted solely in its own interest and that cared little for protecting strong and durable multilateral alliances. The United States, in the minds of its critics, also took reckless actions to defend its national security interests without thinking about the consequences. Obama was determined to correct this. This had been a constant theme of his campaign against presidential opponent Sen. John McCain, more so than almost any domestic issue. In June 2008, speaking in Germany near the place where the Berlin Wall once stood, Obama said that, ""In Europe, the view that America is part of what has gone wrong in the world rather than a force to help make it right has become all too common."" He continued to expound on this theme in his first year as president. His stirring speech in Cairo in June 2009 offered inspirational words to many of his supporters, evidence that the president was serious about fixing the damage that had occurred under Bush. But the promise is unfulfilled. Over the years, it has become clear that Obama left much more of Bush's foreign policy framework in place than many of his supporters had expected. He continued with an extremely aggressive campaign against terrorist networks, employing drone strikes to destroy networks even when there have been significant civilian causalities, allowing for tough interrogation techniques and detention policies and depending on secret processes that created little accountability for what the government was doing, other than when leakers revealed classified information. Inconsistent policies toward authoritarian Middle Eastern regimes in countries such as Syria, as well as turbulence in Egypt following the fall of Hosni Mubarak, have greatly dampened the enthusiasm about Obama that had existed after 2008. Nor did Obama do much to strengthen civil liberties. The public has begun to learn how extensive the surveillance has been on their phones, on their computers and every other type of communication that occurs. In short, the government has been watching. To be sure, the success at generally preventing terrorist strikes within the U.S., barring Boston, is a central accomplishment of his presidency. But the difficulties he has faced achieving the balance he promised in relations with the rest of the world have come with a cost. The NSA issue began with a debate about the proper domestic balance between civil liberties and counterterrorism and has now has extended into the realm of diplomacy. Obama needs to make this right. The controversy hurts the ability of the United States to maintain strong relations with the allies whose support is essential to the war on terrorism, as well as in fighting against other global threats. He must provide answers and show that the government is responding to concerns about NSA practices. One administration official has told the Wall Street Journal that President Obama had been unaware of NSA spying on 35 world leaders and that, as soon as he learned of the practice through an internal review (a response to the political outrage over the revelations of the spy program), he put parts of the program to an end.  Even if this is the case -- and the president will need to make clear this is so given how cynical and skeptical the world has become about U.S. political rhetoric on these matters -- the information begs the question of how the NSA was allowed to remain so unaccountable even to the Commander-in-Chief and, more importantly, what steps President Obama will now take to make sure we conduct our counterterrorism programs within some kinds of parameters and guidelines. If Obama does nothing further, the ongoing revelations will leave behind the same kinds of problems that he, as a candidate, understood to be so devastating in 2008.","Julian Zelizer: Barack Obama promised to reverse George W. Bush's unilateral approach .

"(CNN)Odin Lloyd, who a jury found was murdered by former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez, carved a reputation as a trophy-accumulating athlete with a mischievous streak, according to relatives. Lloyd, 27, found ways to keep smiling outside the family home in Boston's largest and most diverse neighborhood, Dorchester. ""He was always a class clown,"" his sister, Olivia Thibou, told CNN affiliate WHDH. ""Everyone knew him to always make jokes, to laugh."" ""Anybody who knows my brother would say that he's just a funny guy,"" she said. ""He's very respectful. He never really disrespected anybody."" Hernandez was found guilty of first-degree murder charge in Lloyd's death. Prosecutors told the jury that Hernandez orchestrated and covered up the killing of Lloyd, a former friend. Hernandez's attorney, James Sultan, told jurors that Hernandez ""witnessed"" Lloyd's killing, ""committed by somebody he knew,"" and that the former NFL player ""really didn't know what to do, so he put one foot in front of another"" and moved on with his life. Two other men who were drug dealers allegedly killed Lloyd, Sultan told the jury. Lloyd, who was working for a landscaping firm, also played football for the Boston Bandits, the oldest semi-pro team in Boston and the winners of four championships in the New England Football League, the team's website says. The team's Facebook page features several photos of Lloyd and lists him as an outside linebacker with jersey number 53. Lloyd's family home features his trophies in baseball and basketball, as well as football. One trophy said ""MVP,"" most valuable player. They were all on display on the family's front porch during news conferences when the family pressed investigators to find out who killed him. Lloyd's body was found riddled with gunshot wounds on June 17, 2013, in a secluded area of an industrial park near Hernandez's house, authorities said. A jogger discovered the body. Investigators later found five shell casings at the scene. Inside Lloyd's pocket, authorities said, they found a wallet and keys to a car that Hernandez had rented. Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée, Thibou told CNN. Her brother and Hernandez went to a Boston nightclub together a few days before his death, she said.","Odin Lloyd played linebacker for the Boston Bandits, the city's oldest semi-pro team .

"(CNN)Liberation 70 years ago today at Auschwitz-Birkenau was anything but a celebration for my mother, Rena Margulies, who as an 11-year-old prisoner was one of the very few children to survive the Nazi death factory. She lacked the capacity to celebrate as Russian troops in their long coats and fur hats plowed through the snow-covered landscape into the massive camp. Rena was emotionally numb, intellectually bewildered and physically drained. At that moment she could hardly imagine that the madness that had destroyed her family and community could suddenly be lifted, that life could somehow return to a semblance of normality. Liberation simply allowed her to ease her focus on immediate survival and begin a long search for understanding. In the days leading to liberation, she and her mother, Hinda, had hidden under the wooden planks of a barrack as Nazi guards evacuated the camp, forcing prisoners on death marches and shooting those who could not march; she had witnessed musselmen, skeletal figures inhaling their last breaths, collapsing upon each other in a pile of death.  She had repressed mourning for her little brother Romek who had been gassed four months earlier. One had to endure with stoicism, since any show of emotion could elicit a deadly beating or a bullet to the head. She had lived under a cloud of uncertainty and fear, wondering what had become of her father who had also been imprisoned in Auschwitz, all as she suffered from tuberculosis and malnutrition. The Russian Red Army may have have physically liberated Rena, but mentally she remained imprisoned, still feeling that she was surrounded by death. The coming days brought a series of disorienting events, rather than celebrations. The Russians handed the children striped prison uniforms, which they had never worn in camp. Rena put the uniform over her gray sackcloth dress, then marched with the other children by the barbed wire as a Russian camera crew filed the scene. This would become an iconic film clip documenting the liberation, but one that spread the false idea that all Auschwitz prisoners wore such striped uniforms when in fact they were for slave laborers who worked in Aussenkomando brigades outside the camp. On the train ride with her mother and Aunt Andzia back to their hometown of Tomaszow-Mazowiecki in central Poland, people exclaimed, ""Oh, the Jews are back. Too bad Hitler didn't kill you all!,"" then shoved Hinda and Andzia off the train.  The Holocaust was over, but hate remained very much alive. It was not until four decades later that the day of liberation would come to be a celebration of sorts. Rena, her cousin Frieda and a small group of child survivors gathered on January 27, 1985, to celebrate what they determined was their common ""birthday"" -- the day they were reborn to have a second chance at life. For each year afterward, the child survivors would meet for a weekend around January 27 to celebrate their rebirth, share cake, flowers and good wishes, but also to reflect, discuss, study and help each other face the trauma they had endured. Enough time had elapsed that they could then confront the nightmare. Study and reflection is exactly what the United Nations intended for this date when in 2005 the international body declared January 27 to be International Holocaust Remembrance Day. The U.N. urged ""... member states to develop educational programmes that will inculcate future generations with the lessons of the Holocaust in order to help prevent future acts of genocide."" Today, there are numerous deeply meaningful curricula that are of great benefit to students of all backgrounds. Just as my mother and her child survivor friends sought understanding as they tried to come to terms with the unimaginable, students around the globe must be engaged in education about the Holocaust and the lessons it holds for humanity -- because, tragically, the liberation of Auschwitz failed to deliver an end to terrorism and genocide. The world continues to suffer from too much hate-driven violence, from this month's terror attacks in Paris, to genocides in Syria, Darfur, Rwanda and Bosnia, all case studies that the lessons of the Holocaust 70 years on remain as relevant as ever. They still must be taught, more widely disseminated and never forgotten. This is a day not merely to commemorate, but to educate.","Allan Chernoff's mother was 11 when she was among those liberated from Auschwitz .

"I'm a sucker for all of those man-on-the-street interviews that late-night shows do to reveal just how dumb Americans are. It's fun to laugh at the people who struggle with simple math problems or are unable to find any country we're at war with on a map. More than a few even get tripped up trying to name the branches of government. It's all fun and games until you remember that elections have consequences, and that many of those people who said they could name the president -- but not the commander in chief -- will soon be standing in a voting booth, armed with a ballot. If you think government dysfunction is the country's No. 1 problem -- and according to a recent Gallup poll, a third of the nation does -- then maybe we should take those hilarious late-night interviews a little more seriously. You see, while we were busy waving our angry finger at Washington, the   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its findings from the Survey of Adult Skills. The group's research measured the literacy, math and computer skills of 5,000 adults from 16 to 65 and compared those numbers with that of 21 other countries. The good news is that we didn't finish last in anything. The bad news is that we're in pretty sad shape when not finishing last is the good news. Trailing every country in the survey except Italy and Spain in math is rough. But how the OECD's findings may play a role in elections and the economy is disturbing. According to the report, ""individuals who score at lower levels of proficiency in literacy are more likely than those with higher proficiency to ... believe that they have little impact on the political process."" Also ""in most countries, individuals with lower proficiency are also more likely to have lower levels of trust in others."" U.S. adults ranked 16th in literacy proficiency. The OECD findings seem to be consistent with that of the U.S. Department of Education, which estimated back in 2009 that some 32 million adults lacked the proficiency to read a newspaper. This was captured by a witty USA Today headline about the findings: ""Literacy study: 1 in 7 U.S. are unable to read this story."" That was kinder than the New York Post headline after the new OECD report: ""U.S. adults are dumber than the average human."" An uneducated workforce is a hindrance to us all and an uninformed electorate is the thorn in democracy's side, taunting us with the words of Joseph de Maistre: ""Every country has the government it deserves."" While it seems there's a chance we could be headed toward an agreement that will put an end to the partial government shutdown, we must not overlook the fact that the man most credited/blamed for the disruption was on the Senate floor quoting ""Green Eggs and Ham"" during his filibuster. But this is not just a Republican problem. I can't help but notice the correlation between a more partisan nation and a more dumb-ass nation -- regardless of party. Remember Ted Cruz is not the first politician to drag Dr. Seuss into the mess that is Washington. In 2007, during the immigration debate, Sen. Harry Reid read a piece from the New York Times that contained quotes from ""The Cat in the Hat."" ""And this mess is so big. And this mess is so deep and so tall, we can not pick it up. There is no way at all!"" Reid then went on to say: ""Mr. President, some would say that is what we have in the Senate today -- a big mess. But if you go back and read Dr. Seuss, the cat manages to clean up the mess."" I used to think politicians such as Cruz and Reid quoted from children's books as a way to insult the intelligence of their political foes. Now I'm wondering if it's because they're afraid using big words would lose the rest of us. When Gallup asked Americans what was the country's top problem, after dysfunctional government, the top-listed items were the economy (19%), unemployment (12%), the deficit (12%) and health care (12%) . Sadly education didn't crack the top five, despite being the one area that really links them all. ""Proficiency in literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology rich environments is positively and independently associated with the probability of participating in the labour market and being employed, and with higher wages,"" the new OECD report stated. Educators will tell you the best catalyst for prolonged academic success is early childhood education. Among the 38 OECD and G20 countries that participated in a report released last year, we were 28th in the percentage of 4-year-olds who are receiving early childhood education. Hmmm, those late-night interviews aren't so funny anymore.","LZ Granderson cites recent OECD report showing Americans ranking low on skills .

"While President Obama has reignited a national conversation over rising college costs with his new proposals, those suggestions are unlikely to dramatically lower costs soon. And the president has not given many specific suggestions how to cut these costs that have been rising dramatically faster than people's income. Tuition fees are roughly double the share of income then they were in the 1960s. Let me offer five suggestions on how to lower post-secondary educational costs. This list is not comprehensive, but full implementation of even some of them could reduce the burden that colleges impose on students, parents and taxpayers. First, adopt the three-year bachelor's degree as in Europe. Students at prestigious schools like Oxford and Cambridge receive their degrees in three years, and they still get first-class jobs. Diminishing returns sets into collegiate study like anything else, and much of the material in the last two years of college is of marginal importance, with the possible exception of some demanding majors such as engineering and architecture. The feds could simply say undergraduate student eligibility for financial assistance ends after 90 semester hours of study.  This approach should reduce the cost of a B.A. degree by something on the order of 25%. A less cost-saving variant of the three-year plan would keep the degree at its traditional 120 semester hour length, but have students go to school year-round for three years. We really don't need the summer off to plant crops as people did hundreds of years ago. Facilities would get greater utilization, lowering capital costs. College graduates would gain an extra year working full-time. Faculty usually will teach additional courses for far less than the average pay per course taught regularly. Maintenance costs of facilities per student would also fall. Second, make it possible for students to use MOOCs (massively open online courses) and other low-cost, online options, allowing for lower cost ""blended"" degrees combining perhaps two years of traditional classroom experience with an equal amount of online training. This would cut the cost of quality degrees perhaps 40%. Without any governmental involvement, teachers and  entrepreneurs have brought hundreds of high-quality but free or low-cost courses to the internet --Udacity, Coursera, EdX, StraighterLine, Saylor Foundation, Khan Academy and Twenty Million Minds Foundation are examples of a few providers or facilitators of quality instruction.  Yet students seldom get credit for these courses.  The barriers are not technological, but legal or involve overcoming special interest obstruction. Students need to be examined on the online material, with safeguards assuring the registered student is actually being tested. Obstacles to accrediting these innovative approaches need to be overcome. The federal government, which accredits the accreditation agencies, could tell these agencies they must allow accredited schools to accept as much as 60% of coursework from MOOC or related providers.  The federal government can't deliver the mail or run a national medical care system efficiently, so they should not be the prime mover here. Where is the Gates Foundation or Warren Buffet when we need them? Third, offer a traditional residential degree for 40% less by dramatically reducing labor and capital costs. The typical university employs twice as many ""professional non-instructional personnel"" (administrators) per 100 students as it did 40 years ago. Why not create new universities with staffing near the 1970 norms -- a university without sustainability and diversity coordinators or an army of public relations specialists, where faculty teach extensively rather than do trivial research that no one reads, and where there are no expensive intercollegiate athletic programs for the amusement of non-students. Specifically, ask the faculty to teach four classes per semester instead of two or three. Build few buildings but utilize them extensively, including on Fridays, weekends and summer months.  Have a least two faculty members for each administrator (the ratio now is often one to one). Prohibit faculty from teaching trivial courses in their specialty. Do we really need courses on ""Lady Gaga and the Sociology of Fame"" taught to students who are clueless about  Beethoven, Shakespeare and van Gogh?  Limit the pay of all employees to no more than that of the president of the United States or less.  Could existing universities do this? They haven't, so state governments might have to create new institutions from the ground up. Fourth, create a National College Equivalence Test similar to the high school GED. A good national test of basic reading, writing, mathematical and general knowledge about our institutions and society could be administered by, say, the Scholastic Testing Service, or ACT.  High scores on the test would lead to a ""college equivalence certificate."" Most students want a diploma as a ticket to a good job. Employers could use scores on the equivalency test as an alternative certification device, and individuals could take the test anytime --even home schooled kids with little formal education. Fifth, get the federal government out of the student financial aid business. There is good evidence the 11.7% annual growth in federal student financial aid over the past decade (and similar growth earlier) has encouraged colleges to raise tuition fees and finance a costly academic arms race. Lower income Americans are a smaller proportion of recent college graduates than in 1970, before Pell Grants began. If we implement the first four reforms, the need for student financial assistance will dramatically decline. The current system breeds high dropout rates, rewards poor performance (students lingering in school get more aid than those graduating promptly) and encourages kids to enter college who would be better off entering trade schools or apprentice programs.  Ending these inefficient federal programs would save tens of billions annually. In short, there are lots of thing we can do to make colleges more affordable beyond the president's idea of providing good consumer information by rating colleges.","President Obama is proposing steps to reduce costs of college .

"More than 1,000 veterans may have died in the last decade because of malpractice or lack of care from Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers, a new report issued by the office of Sen. Tom Coburn finds. The report aggregates government investigations and media reports to trace a history of fraudulent scheduling practices, budget mismanagement, insufficient oversight and lack of accountability that have led to the current controversy plaguing the VA. The VA has admitted that 23 patients have died because of delayed care in recent years, but the report, titled ""Friendly Fire: Death, Delay, and Dismay at the VA,"" shows many more patient deaths have been linked to systemic issues affecting VA hospitals and clinics throughout the U.S. Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican and physician, says that if the VA's budget had been properly handled and the right management had been in place, many of these deaths could have been avoided. ""Over the past decade, more than 1,000 veterans may have died as a result of VA malfeasance,"" said Coburn, a three-time cancer survivor who says the government should offer veterans access to private hospitals. ""Poor management is costing the department billions of dollars more and compromising veterans' access to medical care,"" he said. Since November 2013, CNN has been reporting on how veterans wait excessive periods for VA health care, causing some to die in the process. Coburn's office says the VA has allocated about $20 billion since the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to numerous non-health-related projects, such as office makeovers, unused software licenses, undocumented purchases on government debit cards and the funding of call centers that received an average of 2.4 calls per day, among others. In 2013, four VA construction projects in Las Vegas, Orlando, Denver and New Orleans cost an extra $1.5 billion because of scheduling delays and excessive expenditures, the report shows. Additional funds have been funneled into legal settlements. Since 2001, the VA has paid about $845 million in malpractice costs, of which $36.4 million was used to settle claims involving delayed health care. Criticism of the VA's budget has increased in light of a controversial performance bonus system that allegedly created financial incentives for managers to hide the fact that patients were waiting months for care. At a congressional hearing Friday, Gina Farrisee, the VA assistant secretary for human resources and administration, confirmed that 78% of VA senior managers qualified for extra pay or other compensation in fiscal year 2013, despite ongoing delay and malpractice controversies. Former VA Regional Director Michael Moreland received a $63,000 bonus in 2013 for infection prevention policies, for example, but the VA's Office of Inspector General concluded that his policies failed. Moreland presided over the Pittsburgh VA, where an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease killed six veterans in 2011 and 2012. The report identifies crimes committed by VA staff, including drug dealing, theft and sexual abuse of patients dating back many years. Earlier this year, one former staffer at the Tampa, Florida, VA was sentenced to six years in federal prison for trading veterans' personal information for crack cocaine. A CNN investigation recently uncovered an additional scheme at the Phoenix VA hospital, where records of dead veterans were changed to hide how many died while waiting for care. The VA's inspector general is investigating 69 medical centers for allegations that administrators altered appointment data to make patient wait times appear to be shorter. A letter released Monday by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel rebuked the VA's medical review agency for refusing to admit that delays in care have affected veterans' health. Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said in a news conference in Washington last week that he plans to remove more VA officials from their positions once he receives more information from the inspector general.

"When Zane Buzby traveled into remote parts of Eastern Europe to find the birthplace of her grandparents, she knew it would be a life-changing journey. She could never have imagined how much. She met a professor who asked her to bring supplies to eight elderly Holocaust survivors in Belarus. Soon after she crossed the border, she found herself in another world. ""It was as if I'd gone back in time 100 years. There were no cars, only horse-drawn wagons, little slanted huts,"" Buzby recalled. ""It was something out of 'Fiddler on the Roof.' "" Buzby was appalled to find the survivors living alone in shacks, suffering in abject poverty. They often had to choose between buying food, medicine or paying for heat. Back home in Los Angeles, Buzby was unable to forget them. ""I don't speak Russian, so I put a heart on a piece of paper, put a Jewish star in it and put $20 bills in an envelope,"" said the 65-year-old television director. ""I just wanted them to know I cared."" Soon the survivors began writing back, sharing their stories from the war. Using a translator, Buzby began corresponding with them, and the professor sent her names of others in need. ""Suddenly there was a list -- 50, 80, 100 people,"" she said. For seven years, Buzby carried out this work with help from family and friends. In 2008, she formed the Survivor Mitzvah Project, a nonprofit that provides financial aid and friendship to 2,000 elderly Holocaust survivors throughout Eastern Europe. The lingering impact of the war . Many of the Jews in Eastern Europe were not sent to concentration camps. Their villages were instead targeted by Nazi mobile units, which massacred thousands. To survive, people fled into the woods. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes . ""As a child, I ran from the killing squads three times,"" wrote Ruven from Lithuania. ""Even now, I still dream that I am running."" After the war, those who returned to their villages had little or no extended family left. Many have not been able to get reparations intended for Holocaust survivors. Now in their 80s and 90s, they find themselves struggling once again to survive. Since 2001, Buzby said, she and her group have distributed more than $2.5 million in direct aid to members of what she has dubbed the ""unluckiest generation."" Some of them have endured multiple conflicts and have lost family members to Chernobyl or were left penniless after the Soviet Union disbanded. ""But through it all, they have a great philosophy on life,"" she said. ""For them, holding a hand, sharing a moment, that means everything."" A lifeline of letters . Every one to two months, Buzby sends at least $100 each to most of the people on her roster, along with a letter about her life. She has realized that the personal connection is something these people crave the most. ""The money is lifesaving, but the letters are equally lifesaving,"" said Buzby. ""These people are living often without any parents, siblings, friends. They're isolated."" ""Your letter for me is like a little ray of sunshine in the darkness,"" wrote Rakhil from Ukraine. ""I am no longer alone in my apartment. The letter with your photographs is on the table,"" wrote Fira from Ukraine. After the recession hit America in 2008, survivors reiterated how much the letters meant. ""I got so many letters that started with, 'We heard that your country is broke. If you can't send us any more money, we understand. Just please keep writing,' "" Buzby said. Buzby receives more than 900 letters a year. Each one is quickly read by a Russian speaker in her office. If it does not describe an urgent situation for the group to address, the letter gets e-mailed to volunteer translators. Then Buzby's return letter is translated into Russian and sent out with the funds. Once or twice a year, Buzby also visits some of the people she helps. ""We have definitely created what I call a 'family of strangers,' "" she said. ""I have all these grandparents praying for me."" Buzby is desperate to preserve the survivors' stories. She is working on a documentary about their experiences and hopes to donate her archive of nearly 10,000 letters to a museum or university. ""They've trusted me with their stories, so I need to make sure (their stories) live longer than I do,"" she said. Buzby mostly wants to help them live out their final days in dignity. ""We can really write a more hopeful final chapter to the Holocaust, one of kindness and compassion,"" she said. ""What a way to give them what they finally deserve at the end of their lives.""

"Arlington, Virginia (CNN) -- The man who authorities say shot and wounded two police officers outside the Pentagon Thursday before he was fatally shot had a history of mental health problems and a penchant for spouting anti-government conspiracy theories. John Patrick Bedell repeatedly tangled with police in recent months, while his relationship with his parents -- whom he lived with in a gated community in Northern California -- grew increasingly contentious. ""There's a history of mental health problems with him that the family's been dealing with for a number of years,"" San Benito County, California, Sheriff Curtis Hill said Friday. Bedell, 36, suffered from bipolar disorder, according to court records from a 2006 California arrest for a man by the same name. That man's birth date matches the one authorities gave for the Pentagon shooter. Bedell had been committed to mental institutions at least three or four times, according to Hill. His ties to family had grown strained since late last year. Two months ago, Bedell's parents filed a missing person report about him, although he returned and the report was canceled two weeks later, Hill said. Bedell's mother had also come across ""some information -- either from an e-mail received from a company, or an online posting on a bank account or something -- where on the 10th of January he had made a $600 purchase at a shooting range in the Sacramento area in California,"" Hill said. Bedell would not tell her what he bought, he said. On Friday the FBI said they believe that Bedell drove to Washington, D.C., and parked his car in a garage near the Pentagon. Bedell ""was very well dressed in a suit"" and showed ""no distress in his appearance"" as he approached a screening area to enter Pentagon grounds about 6:40 p.m. Thursday evening, Pentagon Police Chief Richard S. Keevill said. ""He walked very directly to the officers and engaged,"" Keevill said. ""He was very well armed. I will tell you that he had two 9 mm semiautomatic weapons and many magazines."" On Friday, a picture emerged of Bedell as a troubled man with an intense interest in science. On the social networking Web site LinkedIn, a profile page for a J. Patrick Bedell in the San Francisco Bay Area -- where Bedell's family lives -- described him as an ""MSEE student,"" short for Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. The page said he graduated from the University of California Santa Cruz with a bachelor's degree in physics in 1994. The LinkedIn page said that Bedell attended San Jose State University from 1995 to 1996, but that he did not get a degree there. In the missing person report filed in January, Bedell's father said he worked in the San Jose area but that he did not know where. Hill, the San Benito County sheriff, said the Bedell family filed the missing person report on January 4, a day after Bedell was stopped in Texas for speeding as he traveled west. The Texas Highway patrolman used Bedell's cell phone to call Bedell's family, Hill said. ""The highway patrolman wanted to know a little more information about him because when he stopped him for speeding, when he came up to the car, the interior of the vehicle was in 'disarray,'"" Hill said. The patrolman spoke with Bedell's mother, then gave him a warning and sent him on his way, Hill said. The sheriff said the stop prompted the family to file the missing person report, Hill said. In filing the report, Bedell's father said John had been staying at an unknown address in San Jose after getting into a fight with his brother three weeks earlier. It wasn't Bedell's first blowout with his brother. In July 2006, Bedell got into an altercation with Matthew Bedell and signed a citizen's arrest to have him taken to jail and booked, Hill said. A week after Bedell's father filed the missing report in January, the parents called the police to say their son had shown up. Authorities went to the family's home, where the parents said Bedell ""appeared to be impaired, delusional, and agitated,"" according to Hill. ""The agitation ... was due to his mother asking him questions [such as], 'Where have you been? What have you been doing?'"" Hill said. She also asked him about the $600 purchase at the shooting range, he said. ""When she asked him to give her some details about what that purchase was, that's when he became agitated and left the residence,"" Hill said. Authorities arrived after he had left, and although they gave out information on him to law enforcement agencies, they were not able to find him, Hill said. The family told authorities that he had a ""history of mental illness."" On January 18, Bedell's father told authorities his son had returned home and that the missing person report should be canceled, Hill said. According to the police report, Bedell was staying at an unknown address after stopping at home. A couple weeks later, on February 1, Bedell was picked up by police in Reno, Nevada, and charged with marijuana possession. His court date was Tuesday, but Bedell failed to show up. Court records from California show that investigators arrested a John Patrick Bedell in June 2006 on charges of cultivating marijuana and resisting arrest. Bedell pleaded guilty. ""I sincerely request the court not find the offense to reflect a propensity for violence on my part,"" he said in a signed statement in the case. ""I was experiencing an episode of mental illness (bipolar disorder) during the event in question."" Court documents from the 2006 case also include a statement from Bedell's psychiatrist confirming Bedell suffered from bipolar disorder and describing him as ""relatively symptom-free when under medication."" In an Internet posting, JPatrickBedell referred to being arrested in 2006 on marijuana charges. ""Given my belief that cannabis prohibition is the least defensible and most unjust aspect of the prohibitionist regime existing throughout the world today, I decided in March 2006 to cultivate cannabis in full view of the world,"" the person said in a 2006 podcast. Bedell appears to have been the same man who had railed against the government repeatedly on the Internet. Through podcasts and a Wikipedia page, a man identified online as JPatrickBedell cast the government as a criminal force destroying personal liberties. ""This seizure of the United States government by an international criminal conspiracy is a long-established reality,"" the man said in a podcast in November 2006, which also was published as text online. Such an organization, the man said, ""would use its powers to convert military, intelligence, and law enforcement bureacracies (sic) into instruments for political control and the domination and subjection of society, while discrediting, destroying, and murdering honest individuals within those services that work to root out corruption and faithfully serve their fellow citizens."" In a video posted on YouTube in October 2006, a man identified as jpbedell talked about his idea for ""information currency,"" which he said would ""create a financial market for information."" The man in the video is the same man shown in a photograph of the shooter released Friday by the FBI. The man's voice in the YouTube video also sounds similar to the voice in the podcasts. A person using the screen name JPatrickBedell wrote about the same idea on a Wikipedia page that was taken down early Friday. The San Benito County sheriff read a statement from the family on Friday, saying that they were ""devastated"" by Thursday's news. ""To the outside world, this tragedy is the first and only thing they will know of Patrick; to us he was a beloved son, brother, grandson, nephew and cousin,"" the family said, according to Hill. ""We may never know why he made this terrible decision. One thing is certain, though, his actions were caused by an illness and not a defective character."" They expressed hope for a quick recovery of the two wounded officers, and asked that the family's privacy be respected. ""This is a well-respected longtime local family,"" Hill told CNN on Friday. ""They're a middle -- upper-middle class folks who are well known in the community. They're a good solid family."" Hill said that Bedell's father is a financial advisor and that his mother works at the local branch of the California-based Gavilan College. At a news conference Friday morning, Keevill, the Pentagon police chief, said Pentagon and Metro cameras of the area show the gunman in the time leading up to the shooting. He showed ""no real emotion in his face"" as he approached the officers, Keevill said. He approached the officers Thursday evening and, when asked for identification, pulled a gun out of his pocket and began shooting, authorities said. Officers Jeffrey Amos and Marvin Carraway returned fire with semiautomatic weapons, said Pentagon spokesman Terry Sutherland. The two wounded officers had superficial injuries and were released from a hospital, officials said. When officers located Bedell's vehicle at a nearby parking garage, they found more ammunition inside, Keevill said. Authorities do not know what the man's motive may have been, he said. Several versions of a 2004 scientific proposal to the Department of Defense, attributed to J. Patrick Bedell, exist in multiple locations on the Internet. A 28-page version of the proposal, ""Aluminum Anodization for DNA Integrated Circuits,"" lists Bedell as the sole employee for the project and estimates he would work 1,000 hours at $30 an hour for a total of $30,000. The proposal was a response to an April 2004 call from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which provides research grants for projects related to defense. It was not clear if Bedell ever submitted the proposal. A DARPA spokesperson would not confirm whether the proposal was received, saying the agency could legally comment only on proposals it funded. ""Investigators are searching the car, conducting interviews and reviewing a video of the shooting in an effort to piece together a timeline of Bedell's activities leading up the incident,"" the FBI said in a news release. CNN's Dan Simon and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","John Patrick Bedell's family says ""actions were caused by an illness""

"Dr. Kent Brantly answered a calling. That's what friends and colleagues say about the man who garnered national headlines when he became the first known Ebola hemorrhagic fever patient in the United States. Brantly, 33, arrived Saturday in Atlanta from Liberia, where he and another American missionary worker contracted the deadly virus while caring for Ebola patients. From an early age, Brantly was driven by his faith in God to make a difference, friends and former colleagues said. He took mission trips to Uganda, Honduras, Nicaragua, Tanzania and Haiti, they said. ""He intended to be a missionary before he became a doctor,"" friend Kent Smith, an elder at Southside Church of Christ in Fort Worth, Texas, told CNN. ""Eventually, he decided medical mission is what he wanted to do."" Brantly went to Liberia with his wife and two children last year to serve a two-year fellowship through Samaritan's Purse post-residency program. He was there initially to practice general medicine. But when the Ebola outbreak began, he took on the role of medical director for the Samaritan's Purse Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia. It's there that he tested positive for the virus, according to the evangelical Christian relief charity. There is no known cure or vaccine for Ebola, and it has a mortality rate of up to 90%. iReport: Ebola patient arrives . Brantly is in an isolation ward at Emory University Hospital, near the headquarters for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Doctor put sick patients first . The news Brantly contracted Ebola has prompted many to ask why would he put himself at risk. The answer might be difficult for some to understand, his former college and medical school professor wrote in an op-ed published this week in The Indianapolis Star. ""Simply put, he would say that he had been called to care for the patients in Liberia,"" Richard Gunderman wrote in the newspaper. None of it has been surprising to Smith, who first met Brantly five years ago at church. ""When he first started coming to our church, he and his wife made it clear ... they were committed to medical missions,"" he said. Before heading to Liberia in October 2013, Brantly did his residency at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth. 'What do I bring to the table?' ""We're kind of proud that there was a hero out there trying to do his best to make life better for other folks under the circumstances,"" a physician who knows him, Dr. Paul Pepe of Dallas' UT Southwestern Medical Center, told CNN affiliate WFAA this week. Brantly attended high school in Indianapolis before graduating from Abilene Christian University (Texas) in 2003 and Indiana University's medical school in 2009. While at Abilene Christian, he spent a summer interning overseas with a program focused on vocational missions experiences, ACU's online alumni magazine reported. ""Everyone here who has been connected with Kent knows him to be someone who is very compassionate, considerate and always upbeat in all he does,"" the program's director, Dr. Gary Green, told the magazine. ""... Kent's the kind of guy who would weigh benefits versus risk, then try to take himself out of the equation so that he would be thinking, 'What do I bring to the table? Is the risk worth taking because I can benefit so many people?'"" It perhaps may explain why when only one dose of an experimental serum to treat Ebola was made available this week in Liberia that Brantly turned it down and asked that it be given to his colleague. ""I would have been surprised if he had not done that,"" Smith said. 'Praying fervently' In an e-mail this week from Monrovia, Brantly told a fellow doctor at John Peter Smith Hospital that he is ""terrified,"" according to The Indianapolis Star. ""I'm praying fervently that God will help me survive this disease,"" Brantly said in an e-mail to Dr. David McRay, the newspaper reported. Though Brantly's wife and children had been in Liberia with him, they were in the United States when he became ill. ""Many people have been asking how I am doing,"" Amber Brantly said in a statement released earlier this week. ""The children and I are physically fine."" The CDC has said neither Brantly's wife or his children are symptomatic. Brantly's wife, parents and sister cried when they saw him on CNN, walking from the ambulance into the hospital, a family representative said on condition of anonymity. His wife, Amber, later said she was relieved that her husband was back in the United States. ""I spoke with him, and he is glad to be back in the U.S.,"" she said in statement sent to CNN. ""I am thankful to God for his safe transport and for giving him the strength to walk into the hospital."" Brantly's wife visited with him from behind a glass wall for about 45 minutes, the family representative said. Kent Brantly was described as being ""in great spirits and so grateful.""","Report: ""I'm praying fervently that God will help me survive,"" the doctor writes .

"(CNN) -- Mega churches across the United States are becoming increasingly popular which is not only bringing thousands of worshippers together, but also billions of dollars in profit. From self-help books to CDs and DVDs, mega churches are becoming big money makers for the pastors and ministries they are a part of. Mega churches are extra-large churches that can accommodate upwards of 15,000 people and are common among members of the evangelical Christian faith. Scott Thumma, professor of sociology and religion at Hartford Seminary told CNN that ""the mega church on average has about $6.5 million in income a year."" ""If you put together all the mega churches in the United States, that's easily several billion dollars."" Many ministers in the evangelical faith have become superstars in their own right -- Joel Osteen is one in particular. Osteen is a pastor at the Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas and his televised service reaches over seven million people each week across the United States and around the world. The Lakewood Church which Osteen is in charge of has a yearly budget of more than $80 million, but church officials deny that it's about money. ""We hear the criticism a bit, but we don't hear it as much as you think we would,"" Donald Iloff Junior, advisor for Lakewood Church said. ""One thing you find very absent is the asking of money and never once have we asked for money or donations on television."" However, some critics argue that it's hard to be both a pastor and someone in charge of a yearly budget in the tens of millions. ""When you have pastors thinking of themselves as CEOs, it's hard to tell the difference between a pastor and P-Diddy,"" Jonathan Walton, Assistant Professor of religious studies at the University of California Riverside told CNN. The way the sermon is told at these mega churches has also completely changed. ""The plasma screen TVs have replaced crosses, Power Point-like presentations of the words of songs and liturgical practices have replaced the hymnals,"" Walton said. ""This really resonates with a younger generation."" The average age of a mega church worshipper is 40 years old -- 13 years younger than at a traditional church. Mega church worshippers tend to not only be younger, but also more diverse. ""One thinks of them as a homogeneous group of white suburban American, but in fact when you go to most of the mega churches, you're going to find diversity of age, income and education levels,"" Thumma said. ""You can also find racial diversity because in almost 30 percent of these mega churches across the country, you have 20 percent or more integration of ethnic groups so it really is quite staggering.""","Each mega church on average brings in $6.5 million each year .
Mega churches are most popular with evangelical Christians .
These churches can hold up to 15,000 people in one service .

"A California man who lost $500,000 at blackjack and pai gow is suing a new Las Vegas casino, alleging he was too drunk to be allowed to gamble over a 17-hour period just before Super Bowl weekend. Mark A. Johnston of Ventura, California, is claiming he shouldn't have to pay the Downtown Grand Las Vegas Hotel & Casino the $500,000 debt because employees served him so much alcohol that he suffered a blackout and was unable to remember the losses or even his gambling, the lawsuit alleges. In an interview Thursday with CNN, Johnston contended he was plied with liquor and victimized in an old-time hustle. ""Just picture a drunk walking the street and he's drunk, and someone pickpockets and takes his money from him. That's how I characterize it,"" Johnston said. ""I feel like it's the days of old Vegas, the way they've been extorting me with letters and attorneys."" The casino, which opened last November, declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing pending litigation, said spokeswoman Nicole Neal. Johnston said that he's not being a bad loser. ""I am not a sore loser. I've lost half a million. I've lost 800,000. I've lost a lot of money. This has nothing to do with that,"" the veteran gambler said. ""Obviously I can afford what I lost."" Johnston, 52, a former owner of a Los Angeles car dealership, was standing beside his $250,000 Mercedes-Benz as he insisted his lawsuit was about a bigger issue. ""This is about you almost killing me,"" Johnston said. ""What if I had gone to bed that night, with all those drinks in me, and I threw up on myself and I choked and died?"" Johnston acknowledged some responsibility for his drinking -- as many as 20 drinks while gambling over 17 hours on top of about 10 drinks before even stepping into the casino. ""My responsibility is, look, I had some drinks at the airport, on the plane. At some point, that's my responsibility,"" Johnston said. ""The unfortunate part about it for them is, they have a bigger responsibility than I do."" Johnston was referring to how the casino must follow Nevada laws on how complimentary drinks are given to gamblers. In fact, the Nevada Gaming Control Board is now investigating the Downtown Grand, formerly the Lady Luck Casino, on whether it violated gaming regulations, said Karl Bennison, chief of the board's enforcement division. Those regulations prohibit casinos from ""permitting persons who are visibly intoxicated to participate in gaming activity"" and from providing ""complimentary service of intoxicating beverages in the casino area to persons who are visibly intoxicated."" ""We are investigating this thoroughly,"" Bennison said. ""We are aware of this matter. We'll see if there are regulation violations."" The casino could face a license revocation or fines or both if the violations are substantiated, Bennison said. Neal, the casino spokeswoman, also declined to comment about the state investigation. Johnston, a frequent gambler in Las Vegas, had always been a cash player at casinos and was never issued a line of credit more than $25,000. Still, in the past 10 years, he had never drawn on any casino line of credit, the lawsuit said. He worked in real estate and car sales and was the owner of a Mercedes-Benz dealership in west Los Angeles. During Super Bowl weekend, however, he and a female friend flew from the Burbank, California, airport to Las Vegas, and he had consumed several alcoholic drinks by the time the couple ate dinner at a restaurant run by the Downtown Grand Casino, according to a sequence of events described in the lawsuit. At dinner, Johnston was visibly drunk, which was also observed by an old friend, a law professor at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas who joined the pair for dinner. Johnston was so inebriated that he had no recollection of leaving the restaurant on January 30 or the subsequent 44 hours, when he gambled in the casino and took out markers totaling $500,000. He lost all that money at the Chinese domino game pai gow and at a private blackjack table during 17 hours of uninterrupted gambling and drinking, until the late afternoon of the following day. Johnston takes prescribed medication that increases the intoxicating effects of alcohol, and a casino host who invited Johnston to the Downtown Grand was aware of Johnston's use of the medication, the suit alleged. ""Mr. Johnston, an experienced gambler, was dropping chips on the floor, confusing chip colors, and slurring his speech badly, and he was unable to read his cards or set his hands properly,"" the lawsuit said. ""To her shock, after sleeping for seven to eight hours, (Johnston's female friend) found Mr. Johnston still gambling at the blackjack table, and still heavily intoxicated, late in the afternoon of January 31, 2014,"" the suit said. The suit recounts how Johnston took out two lines of credit for $100,000 each in the span of 21 minutes after 2 a.m. on January 31. By 10:52 a.m., Johnston had taken out a third marker, for $50,000. Almost two hours later, he signed another marker for $250,000, the suit said. Johnston lost it all. Moreover, the casino allegedly reneged on providing Johnston with a 20% discount on repaying the $500,000, which would have reduced the debt to $400,000, the lawsuit claimed. The casino also allegedly demanded that Johnston repay the $500,000 debt 46 days early, before a March 31 deadline, said the lawsuit, which was filed in February. In the days after losing the $500,000, Johnston went to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, one of his preferred Las Vegas gaming destinations, but a Downtown Grand representative called the Hard Rock and told them of Johnston's debt, cautioning them about doing business with Johnston and ""sullying Mr. Johnston's good name in the process,"" the lawsuit said. The lawsuit seeks to nullify the gambling losses and seeks compensatory as well as punitive damages ""in an amount sufficient to deter the Downtown Grand from similar conduct in the future,"" the suit said.","Mark A.

"Oops, she did it again. Some fans of Britney Spears are accusing the singer of lip-syncing to her song ""Perfume"" during her Las Vegas show. According to gossip site Oh No They Didn't, Spears' mouth is moving but the audience is mostly hearing singer Sia's version of the track. Billboard points out that Sia -- best known for her hit song ""Chandelier"" -- is credited as one of the writers of ""Perfume."" An acoustic version of the song as performed by Sia is big on YouTube. ""If you listen closely to the performance video, you can make out some of Spears' vocals under Sia's more charactered voice,"" Colin Stutz writes for Billboard. ""That's because, most likely, Spears uses Sia's track as an in-monitor guide when she sings. Only this time it was put into the house mix, making for an embarrassing accident."" It's not the first time Spears has been called out for the vocalizations during her Vegas show, which is part of a two-year residency. In reviewing the show for the Los Angeles Times, writer Mikael Wood points out that  the singer's show appears to take its title, ""Piece of Me,"" literally. ""Whatever the scale of the number ... the singer's presence felt so diminished -- her dancing a tentative shadow of what it used to be, her vocals apparently lip-synced for the majority of the show -- as if to make the production's title seem a taunt,"" Wood writes. While her manager Adam Leber initially denied that Spears wasn't singing live during the show, he later backtracked during an interview with Medium.com. ""To put on the show that she puts on, it's virtually impossible to sing the entire time and do what she does,"" he said. ""She's singing on every song, basically, when she has the ability to sing. There's no way you can dance for 90 minutes straight and sing the entire time.""","Billboard says you can hears Spears singing under track .

"As they strolled through Westgate Mall, guns strapped to their torsos, the attackers chatted on their cell phones while they sprayed bullets at terrified shoppers. Ruthless and nonchalant, they randomly gunned down shoppers at the upscale mall in the Kenyan capital. At one point, they took turns to pray, removing shoes to perform the ritual washing in a room stacked with boxes. They bowed down in Islamic prayer, taking a break from incessant gunfire. Chilling footage from mall . Closed-circuit  television footage obtained by CNN provides the chilling new details of what happened during the attack last month. In part, it shows two people with guns casually walking and shooting their way through a supermarket in the mall. During the hours of video, they are seen talking on the phone, praying and shooting toward anything that moved. Al Libi trial, Libya and al Qaeda: What you won't hear in court . A man whimpering in a pool of blood on the floor crawled to get away. A gunman returned and shot him, again. In between the gunfire, the attackers scanned ceilings for surveillance cameras. Nearby, shoppers hid behind cash registers while some ran for their lives. Others, too terrified to move, cowered on bloody floors. Parking lot mayhem . The footage was taken on September 21, day one of the four-day siege. Though the video has no sound, the terror on the faces of the victims is loud and clear. It's not over, Somali terrorists say after Westgate . In addition to the two attackers in the supermarket, the footage shows two more making their way through the parking lot. They opened fire.  Shoppers slithered under cars. Others tumbled to the ground, felled by bullets. The attack left at least 67 people dead, many more injured and dozens unaccounted for. Details match up . Details from the footage appear to corroborate a running commentary  by the Al-Shabaab, which claimed responsibility for the attacks. In its Twitter account during the siege, the terror group said the attacks were conducted by men. It denied reports that terror suspect Briton Samantha Lewthwaite was involved. Bergen: Al-Shabaab backed by money from U.S. Al-Shabaab said it remained in contact with the attackers as they battled Kenyan forces during the hostage crisis. Hostage takers join forces . The attackers in the parking lot later joined the others in the mall. The four wandered, rounding up hostages. A woman with two children and a third in a shopping cart walked by a line of cash registers. A bloody teenage girl followed them; a gunman pointed the way.  The woman, the children and girl were all eventually released. The footage focuses on the corner of the mall closest to the supermarket, which occupies the anchor position in the four-story mall. The stories repeated themselves in various places at the mall, which has more than 80 stores. Many unknowns . There are many mysteries about the mall attack. With dozens still unaccounted for, how many people did the attackers kill? How many terrorists did the Kenyan forces kill? How many civilians and terrorists are buried beneath the concrete chunks of the collapsed section of the mall? It's unclear whether the four terrorists in the video were arrested or gunned down by security forces at the scene.  Even the total  number of assailants is unknown. Kenyans debate: Time to get troops out of Somalia? At the time of the attack, Kenyan officials said that up to 15 gunmen were involved. On day four, as the operation wound down, President Uhuru Kenyatta said five terrorists were killed and 11 suspects were in custody. But since then, the numbers have fluctuated, with different officials citing various numbers between four and six. This month, military spokesman Maj. Emmanuel Chirchir said  four gunmen died when part of the mall collapsed.  It's unclear whether he was referring to those in the video. Their charred bodies, he said, are undergoing DNA tests. Chirchir also released the names of the dead militants, including an American of Somali origin, but analysts say those names may be pseudonyms. Officials have said the answers may be buried beneath the rubble of the collapsed section of the mall. But, as they scour through the mangled heap, there are more questions than answers.","Closed-circuit television footage obtained by CNN provides chilling new details .

"In sting operation last July, undercover FBI agents gained access to a hotel suite by disabling the hotel's Internet, and then posing as Internet repair technicians. Now one of the suspects who was charged in the sting is crying foul. At Caesar's Palace, a casino hotel on the Strip in Las Vegas, FBI agents deliberately cut off the Internet for a suite used by Paul Phua, a high-stakes gambler. Then, they showed up at the suite and made a bogus service call. On their undercover video, you can hear the imposters asking their targets what the trouble is. ""Good morning. We're going to see if we can get the DSL working again,"" one of them says. But during the visit, the agents were actually videotaping the hotel room and its occupants in secret, looking for evidence of online gambling. Phua was subsequently charged with operating an illegal gambling business, some of which was allegedly conducted using the computers set up at the hotel. Authorities allege he is a high-ranking member of the 14-K triad, an Asian crime syndicate. But he is fighting the charges, saying they are based on evidence collected under false pretenses, and that any evidence obtained through a warrantless search based on deception should be tossed out. ""The evidence is the fruit of a flagrant violation of the Fourth Amendment,"" his lawyers said in a court filing. The FBI declined to comment, referring inquiries to the prosecutor's office in Las Vegas. The prosecutors' office said it will respond in court to the complaint, but could not comment to the media on a pending case. But former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes, who served on the agency's review committee for undercover operations for five years, said undercover operations are carefully reviewed before they are conducted, including by agency lawyers. ""The idea that the entire division went rogue and ran this operation without FBI headquarters' concurrence, or senior executive management concurrence and approval, and the United States attorneys, it just doesn't sound right to me,"" Fuentes said. He also said a citizen might not be able to expect the same right to privacy in the common room of his hotel suite, as he would at home in his bedroom. But Tom Goldstein, an attorney for Phua, says the public should be concerned that authorities are trying to surreptitiously conduct searches, using a service interruption as a pretext. ""The danger here is that agents will cut off not only the Internet, but your electricity, your phone, your cable television,"" said Goldstein, ""or at least, you'll worry that it's the government -- every time you have a problem in your house -- that maybe it's an undercover agent that responds.""","The FBI was investigating online gambling .

"(CNN) -- You don't have to be an expert to ask yourself the question: How in the world, with today's technology, can a commercial airplane go missing? It's a question, but also an expression of disbelief. Those who get lost driving can use GPS. If you lose your iPhone, there's an app to track it down. Scientists successfully plotted the course for a spacecraft that landed on a speeding comet. But something goes wrong aboard a 123-foot, 67-ton passenger jet, and rescuers must resort to scouring the ocean? ""Why is it easier to find an iPhone (than) to find a plane?"" one Twitter user, Catalina Buitano, asked. There are dozens of similar questions on social media. They hint at the same sentiment: In a world where people's locations are tracked for everything from map apps to what ads appear on a Web browser, why does Big Brother's gaze avoid the skies? ""Why, in this day and age, do we rely on the physical recovery of black boxes? Flight data should be continuously streamed to the cloud,"" read a tweet by Jacob Rossi. Of course, this question has been asked before. The disappearance of AirAsia Flight 8501 on Sunday was the second time this year that a plane vanished. Debris from the Airbus A320-200 has been found, the airline said Tuesday, and two bodies have been found. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished, too, and remains missing 10 months later. At that time, Jim Hall, the former head of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, called for upgrades to the tracking capabilities of planes that fly for extended periods over water. The airline industry has invested billions of dollars in safety features, ""yet many allow their aircraft to fall off any direct tracking capability as they fly over vast ocean distances and remote locations, confident that these planes will occasionally check in and reappear as they near the other side of the blacked-out area,"" Hall wrote. In a preliminary report on MH370, Malaysian aviation authorities recommended that the International Civil Aviation Organization look into the benefits of introducing a standard for real-time tracking of commercial aircraft. The technology exists to track flight data in real time, but even after tragedies such as MH370, cost and government bureaucracy are cited as obstacles to implementation. ""Millions of us can be located immediately through technology in our handheld cell phones, but a 300,000-pound Boeing 777 with 239 souls on board disappears from the face of the Earth,"" Hall wrote, referring to MH370. ""NASA has the capability of photographing stars billions of light-years away, and yet our best minds are forced to guess where this plane might be."" Another Twitter user phrased the thought this way: ""If we have astronauts reaching safely the International Space Station, why do we still have missing planes on Earth?"" CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo says it is time for world leaders to take concrete action on upgrading technology for tracking planes. Making recommendations isn't enough, she said. There need to be laws. ""I think at this day and age, there's really no excuse for (not having real-time tracking),"" Schiavo said on CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday. ""I mean, the kind of technology, it's already here. We don't have to wait to develop it. Those planes could be sending out continuous signals."" Two companies with products on the market for real-time streaming are Flyht and Star Navigation Systems. But the technology is not catching on with major carriers. Cost has been the biggest hurdle, though the technology is slowly finding its way onto airplanes, said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly. Airlines have lobbied for governments to contribute money to equipping planes with new technology, arguing that it is not just an airline issue, but a national security consideration. The question of who will pay for the technology is beginning to get answered, but not as quickly as travelers would like to see, Kaplan said. So, those in disbelief are not alone in wondering how in today's world a plane could simply get lost. It's just not an easy question to answer.","NEW: Debris from AirAsia flight has been recovered, officials say; two bodies found .

"U.S. contractor Alan Gross, held by the Cuban government since 2009, was freed Wednesday as part of a landmark deal with Cuba that paves the way for a major overhaul in U.S. policy toward the island, senior administration officials tell CNN. President Barack Obama spoke with Cuban President Raul Castro Tuesday in a phone call that lasted about an hour and reflected the first communication at the presidential level with Cuba since the Cuban revolution, according to White House officials. Obama announced Gross' release and the new diplomatic stance at noon in Washington. At around the same time, Cuban president Raul Castro was set to speak in Havana. President Obama announced a major loosening of travel and economic restrictions on the country. And the two nations are set to re-open embassies, with preliminary discussions on that next step in normalizing diplomatic relations beginning in the coming weeks, a senior administration official tells CNN. Talks between the U.S. and Cuba have been ongoing since June of 2013 and were facilitated by the Canadians and the Vatican in brokering the deal. Pope Francis -- the first pope from Latin America -- encouraged Obama in a letter and in their meeting this year to renew talks with Cuba on pursuing a closer relationship. Gross' ""humanitarian"" release by Cuba was accompanied by a separate spy swap, the officials said. Cuba also freed a U.S. intelligence source who has been jailed in Cuba for more than 20 years, although authorities did not identify that person for security reasons. The U.S. released three Cuban intelligence agents convicted of espionage in 2001. The developments constitute what officials called the most sweeping change in U.S. policy toward Cuba since 1961, when the embassy closed and the embargo was imposed. Officials described the planned actions as the most forceful changes the president could make without legislation passing through Congress. For a President who took office promising to engage Cuba, the move could help shape Obama's foreign policy legacy. ""We are charting a new course toward Cuba,"" a senior administration official said. ""The President understood the time was right to attempt a new approach, both because of the beginnings of changes in Cuba and because of the impediment this was causing for our regional policy."" Gross was arrested after traveling under a program under the U.S. Agency for International Development to deliver satellite phones and other communications equipment to the island's small Jewish population. Cuban officials charged he was trying to foment a ""Cuban Spring."" In 2011, he was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempting to set up an Internet network for Cuban dissidents ""to promote destabilizing activities and subvert constitutional order."" After losing hope and health in Cuba, Gross finally released . Senior administration officials and Cuba observers have said recent reforms on the island and changing attitudes in the United States have created an opening for improved relations. U.S. and Cuban officials say Washington and Havana in recent months have increased official technical-level contacts on a variety of issues. Obama publicly acknowledged for the first time last week that Washington was negotiating with Havana for Gross' release through a ""variety of channels."" ""We've been in conversations about how we can get Alan Gross home for quite some time,"" Obama said in an interview with Fusion television network. ""We continue to be concerned about him."" Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Rep. Chris Van Hollen, Gross' Maryland congressman, are on the plane with Alan Gross and his wife, Judy, according to government officials. The group of members left at 4 a.m. ET Wednesday from Washington for Cuba. More on detained Americans . Gross' lawyer, Scott Gilbert, told CNN last month the years of confinement have taken their toll on his client. Gross has lost more than 100 pounds and is losing his teeth. His hips are so weak that he can barely walk and he has lost vision in one eye. He has also undertaken hunger strikes and threatened to take his own life. With Gross' health in decline, a bipartisan group of 66 senators wrote Obama a letter in November 2013 urging him to ""act expeditiously to take whatever steps are in the national interest to obtain [Gross's] release."" The three Cubans released as a part of the deal belonged the so-called Cuban Five, a quintet of Cuban intelligence officers convicted in 2001 for espionage. They were part of what was called the Wasp Network, which collected intelligence on prominent Cuban-American exile leaders and U.S. military bases. The leader of the five, Gerardo Hernandez, was linked to the February 1996 downing of the two civilian planes operated by the U.S.-based dissident group Brothers to the Rescue, in which four men died. He is serving a two life sentences. Luis Medina, also known as Ramon Labanino; and Antonio Guerrero have just a few years left on their sentences. The remaining two -- Rene Gonzalez and Fernando Gonzalez -- were released after serving most of their 15-year sentences and have already returned to Cuba, where they were hailed as heroes. Wednesday's announcement that the U.S. will move toward restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba will also make it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba and do business with the Cuban people by extending general licenses, officials said. While the more liberal travel restrictions won't allow for tourism, they will permit greater American travel to the island. Secretary of State John Kerry has also been instructed to review Cuba's place on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, potentially paving the the way a lift on certain economic and political sanctions. The revised relationship between the U.S. and Cuba comes ahead of the March 2015 Summit of the Americas, where the island country is set to participate for the first time. In the past, Washington has vetoed Havana's participation on the grounds it is not a democracy. This year, several countries have said they would not participate if Cuba was once again barred. While only Congress can formally overturn the five decades-long embargo, the White House has some authorities to liberalize trade and travel to the island. The 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which enshrined the embargo into legislation, allows for the President to extend general or specific licenses through a presidential determination, which could be justified as providing support for the Cuban people or democratic change in Cuba. Both Presidents Clinton and Obama exercised such authority to ease certain provisions of the regulations implementing the Cuba sanctions program. In an effort to boost the nascent Cuban private sector, the President will also allow expanded commercial sales and exports of goods and services to Cuba, particularly building materials for entrepreneurs and private residences, and allow greater business training, as well as permit greater communications hardware and services to go to the island. Other announced changes permit U.S. and Cuban banks to build relationships and travelers to use credit and debit cards. U.S. travelers will be allowed to import up to $400 worth of goods from Cuba, including $100 in alcohol and tobacco -- even Cuban cigars. Remittances by Americans to their families back in Cuba will also be increased to approximately $2,000 per quarter. Officials stressed the moves were not being undertaken to prop up the Castro regime, but rather to encourage further reforms on the island. ""None of this is seen as a reward. All of this is seen as a way of promoting change in Cuba because everything we have done in the past has demonstrably failed,"" another senior administration official said. ""This is not the U.S. government saying Cuba has gotten so much better. It is still an authoritarian state and we still have profound differences with this government."" ""But if we hope for change with Cuba, we must try for a different approach. And we believe that considerably more engagement with the Cuban people and the Cuban government is the way to do that,"" the official said, adding that the United States ""will not for a moment lessen our support for improvement in human rights."" To that end, Cuba has agreed to release 53 political prisoners from a list of names provided by the United States. At least one of the prisoners has already been released. Havana has also agreed to permit significant access by its citizens to the Internet and allow the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations human rights officials back on the island for the first time in years. Talks on a deal began between senior White House and Cuban officials last year and happened in fits and starts, officials said. The officials praised the role the Vatican played as guarantor of the process. Officials would not reveal the name of the U.S. intelligence source, but officials said he was the individual who revealed to the U.S. the Wasp network, which included the Cuban Five. ""He was a very important hero,"" the U.S. official said. The moves are far more sweeping than the last action Obama took toward Cuba in January 2011, when he eased restrictions on travel to and from the island. Relations have been largely frozen since Gross' conviction and the White House has made his release a condition of improved ties. In 2013, Obama drew praise from advocates of changing U.S. policy toward Cuba when he said the U.S. had to be ""creative"" and ""thoughtful"" about fostering change on the island. ""The notion that the same policies that we put in place in 1961 would somehow still be as effective as they are today, in the age of the Internet and Google and world travel, doesn't make sense,"" Obama said at a November 2013 fundraiser in Florida. ""We have to continue to update our policies.""","The Obama administration announces landmark deal with Cuba .

"The first season of ""Serial"" ended this month, but the story is far from finished. The popular podcast detailed an investigation into the 15-year-old murder of Hae Min Lee, a popular high school senior in Baltimore. Her ex-boyfriend and classmate, Adnan Syed, was tried and convicted in 2000. A star witness in the case against Syed was fellow Woodlawn High School student Jay Wilds, who stirred debate this week in a three-part interview with The Intercept. Parts one and two were published Monday and Tuesday. The final part will publish Wednesday. He says he was unfairly portrayed in the podcast, which revisited in-depth the investigation and trial of Syed -- a key part of which was centered on Wilds' testimony. Over the course of the 12-episode podcast, reporter Sarah Koenig pointed to several inconsistencies in Wilds' statements to police and testimony on the witness stand. Some of what Wilds claims in the new interview also contradicts what he told police -- a point he addressed. ""They had to chase me around before they could corner me to talk to me, and there came a point where I was just sick of talking to them. And they wouldn't stop interviewing me or questioning me,"" he said of the police, in part one of the interview. ""Once the police made it clear that my drug dealing wasn't gonna affect the outcome of what was going on, I became a little bit more transparent."" Lee and Syed were seniors at Woodlawn in Baltimore County, Maryland, in January 1999, when she disappeared. Her body was discovered in a city forest three weeks later. Wilds told police that he helped Syed dig the hole where her body was buried and led police to her missing car. He did not serve time in prison after testifying for the prosecution. In the interview, Wilds described seeing Lee, dead in the trunk of a car. ""There's nothing that's gonna change the fact that this guy drove up in front of my grandmother's house, popped the trunk, and had his dead girlfriend in the trunk. Anything that's going to make him innocent doesn't involve me. Hae was dead before she got to my house. Anything that makes Adnan innocent doesn't involve me,"" he said. Wilds originally told police that he saw Lee's body in the parking lot of a Best Buy near the high school. Rabia Chaudry, a civil rights attorney -- who grew up near Syed and tipped the host of ""Serial"" off to the story -- believes Wilds is lying. She pointed to several apparent discrepancies on Twitter. ""I think Jay's next move should be a live televised polygraph, preferably administered by Geraldo #FreeAdnan #Serial #TheMachineWillDie,"" Chaudry wrote. In a piece for The Guardian newspaper, she argued there may be enough evidence for the state to pursue a perjury charge. Koenig, the host of ""Serial,"" has not yet commented on Wilds' interview. He declined to be formally interviewed for her broadcast., which is a spinoff of the radio program ""This American Life.""

"Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu says she has the 60 votes she needs for the Senate to advance a measure Tuesday that would authorize construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. Landrieu has been scrambling to attract at least 15 Democrats to join 45 Republicans to reach the critical 60-vote procedural threshold. She told reporters at the Capitol on Monday night that she'd reached that mark. ""I feel very comfortable,"" Landrieu said. At least 14 Democrats have said they will support the measure. But it's not clear who has agreed to provide the final vote or whether Landrieu's comments simply reflect optimism. One of Landrieu's top targets, West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, said it won't be him. Another target, Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said he is leaning against supporting the bill. If she can shepherd the legislation through the Senate, it would allow Landrieu to demonstrate her influence one last time ahead of a Dec. 6 run-off election in Louisiana, where she faces Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy, who sponsored the bill authorizing the pipeline when the House approved it on Friday. If the Senate ultimately passes the Keystone bill, a confrontation could emerge between Congress and President Barack Obama. The president said at a news conference late last week that he doesn't want Congress to intervene in the State Department's long-running consideration of the project -- and offered his most specific critique of it yet. ""Understand what this project is: It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. It doesn't have an impact on U.S. gas prices,"" Obama said at a Friday news conference in Myanmar.","At least 60 senators will vote to advance legislation authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline, Sen.

"On Sunday, Jerad and Amanda Miller, a married couple, allegedly killed two police officers in an ambush at a Las Vegas pizza restaurant and then murdered another person in an adjacent Walmart.  During the attack, the couple reportedly stated that their attack was part of a ""revolution,"" according to Second Assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill. The Millers appear to have been motivated by extreme far-right views. The couple left a flag at the scene of the crime with the words ""Don't Tread on Me,"" a Revolutionary War symbol used by some anti-government extremists. They also left a swastika at the scene, though McMahill cautioned to reporters, ""We don't necessary believe that they are white supremacists or associated with the Nazi movement. We believe that they equate government and law enforcement ...with Nazis."" McMahill added an assessment of the Millers' ideological roots saying, ""There is no doubt that the suspects have some apparent ideology that's along the lines of militia and white supremacists."" McMahill also confirmed that Jerad Miller had written on his Facebook page that he had been ejected from the Bundy Ranch, the Nevada site where armed ranchers as well some with anti-government militia ties held off federal officials at gunpoint in April.  However, McMahill was not able to confirm Miller's actual presence at the ranch.  (Cliven Bundy's son Ammon said that ""state militia members"" told him the Millers had been at the ranch, but were asked by a militia member to leave because of ""their radical beliefs."") The attack in Vegas is far from the only incident of violence by the American far right.  According to data collected by the New America Foundation, right-wing extremists have killed 37 people in 16 violent incidents, in the United States since the 9/11 attacks. That number is more than the 21 people killed by militants motivated by al-Qaeda's ideology in the United States in the post-9/11 era. Although a variety of left wing militants and environmental extremists have carried out violent attacks for political reasons against property and individuals since 9/11, none have been linked to a lethal attack. As we pointed out in this space less than two months ago, a man shot and killed a 14-year-old boy and his grandfather at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City and then drove to a nearby Jewish retirement community where he shot and killed a third person. Police arrested a suspect, Frazier Glenn Cross, who shouted ""Heil Hitler"" after he was taken into custody. Cross, who also goes by Frazier Glenn Miller, is a well-known right-wing extremist who founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the White Patriot Party, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. A similar attack to the one that Frazier Glenn Cross is accused of in Kansas occurred in August 2012 when Wade Michael Page killed six people in a shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin.  Page was a member of a white supremacist band and associated with the Hammerskins, a white supremacist group. Page committed suicide during the attack. Page is not, of course, the only right-wing extremist to have used lethal violence to achieve political ends. In 2009, for instance, Shawna Forde, Albert Gaxiola, and Jason Bush raided a house in Arizona, killing Raul Flores and his daughter Brisenia. The three attackers sought to use the burglary to finance their anti-immigration vigilante group, Minutemen American Defense.  Forde and Bush were convicted and sentenced to death. Gaxiola was sentenced to life in prison. Also in 2009, Scott Roeder murdered Dr. George Tiller, who ran an abortion clinic in Wichita, Kansas.  In 2010 Roeder was convicted of first-degree murder.  According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Roeder not only had ties to the extreme anti-abortion movement, but he also had been pulled over while driving with a fake license plate bearing the markings of the Sovereign Citizens, a movement of individuals who deny that the government has authority over them. Of course, the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil prior to 9/11 was the Oklahoma City bombing, which was masterminded by Timothy McVeigh, a man with deep ties to far-right militant circles.  McVeigh killed 168 people when he bombed the Alfred P. Murrah federal building on April 19, 1995. Despite the history of deadly violence by individuals motivated by political ideologies other than that of al Qaeda, it is jihadist violence that continues to dominate the news and the attention of policy makers.  Some of this is quite understandable. After all, on 9/11 al Qaeda's 19 terrorists killed almost 3,000 people in the space of a morning. Since then al Qaeda's branch in Yemen tried to bring down -- with a bomb secreted on a passenger -- an American commercial jet flying over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 and al Qaeda's branch in Pakistan tried to launch bombings on the New York subway system a few months earlier. Luckily those plots didn't succeed, but certainly if they had, the death toll would have been on a large scale. Yet the disparity in media coverage can have serious consequences. McMahill told reporters that he had heard reports that the Millers had spoken to a neighbor about their plans adding ""You know we have the 'see something, say something' campaign,"" and urged that, ""We need to hear about those times when individuals or groups of individuals are talking about going out and committing acts of violence -- whether it's against the police or anybody else in our community."" Indeed, in a report on countering radicalization in Muslim communities, the Muslim Public Affairs Council emphasized the need to inform law enforcement when an individual is ejected from a community for being extreme. Countering violent extremism cannot simply be a demand placed on Muslim communities to prevent jihadist violence.  In the decade since 9/11 right-wing extremists have demonstrated their ability to be just as deadly as their homegrown jihadist counterparts. Moreover, killings like the ones of the two police officers in Las Vegas on Sunday demonstrate the need to move beyond the view that the only threat of terrorism or extremist violence comes from radicalized Muslims. A promising development to that end is that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced last week that he is reconstituting a Justice Department task force on domestic terrorism, focused on anti-government plots and racial violence. The task force was originally launched after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.","Peter Bergen: Shooters in Las Vegas murders had extremist, anti-government views .

"A senior adviser to President Barack Obama said it will be tough for someone like Jeb Bush, who hasn't campaigned for elected office in 12 years, to wage a national presidential bid in today's political climate, adding a comparison of the former Florida governor to a fictional ex-criminal from ""The Wire."" In an interview published Monday by the Huffington Post, Dan Pfeiffer said Bush was like the character ""Cutty"", a former drug enforcer who later in life sets up a local gym on the HBO show. ""In his day, big deal. Out of the game for a long time. Gets back in the game. Game's changed,"" Pfeiffer said. ""Jeb Bush, it's been a long time since he's run for office. Politics has changed dramatically since his last race."" According to a recent CNN/ORC International Poll, Bush gained frontrunner status after announcing two weeks ago that he's ""actively exploring"" a presidential bid for 2016. Critics argue that Bush will find himself behind other prospective candidates when it comes to maneuvering the fast-paced, social media-driven machine of modern campaigning. ""I think it will be very challenging for someone who has not been in prominent public life in the age of Twitter to go out on the campaign trail,"" Pfeiffer said. Bush has in part tried to counteract those optics. He made his big announcement this month on Twitter and Facebook, and plans to release an e-book as well as thousands of emails from his time as governor. (The emails, however, were obtained earlier this month by the Washington Post through a public records request). The documents indicate that Bush was an avid fan of email and even responded to hundreds of constituents and job applicants himself.

The 34-year-old contractor, who until a few years ago had served in the Navy, spelled out this belief -- with the words, ""My ELF weapon"" -- in the sawed-off Remington 870 shotgun he brought into the military facility's Building #197 on the morning of September 16. ""ELF"" refers to low-frequency electromagnetic waves, a technology used for submarine communications that conspiracy theorists believe the government employs to monitor and manipulate unsuspecting citizens, the FBI said. ""Ultra low frequency attack is what I've been subject to for the last 3 months,"" read a message obtained by federal authorities from Alexis's thumb drives, phones and computers. ""And to be perfectly honest, that is what has driven me to this."" ""This"" is the incident that left the Navy, Washington and the nation in shock. Alexis was quickly tabbed as the shooter. Still, big questions loomed as to why he did it, as well as whether he'd gotten help or told anyone about his plans. Valerie Parlave, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington field office, stated unequivocally Wednesday ""the investigation has determined that Alexis acted alone."" Asked whether he talked to or e-mailed anyone ahead of the attack, Parlave responded simply: ""No."" The public also got the first chance Wednesday to see Alexis in action that day, through surveillance video and photos. They start with Alexis driving his rented blue Toyota Prius, with New York plates, around 7:53 a.m. into a parking garage, and then 15 minutes later carrying a backpack into Building #197. A still photo, taken afterward, shows that backpack hung on the inside wall of a fourth-floor bathroom stall -- where he'd put his shotgun together, authorities say. The most chilling footage shows Alexis, dressed in a short-sleeve polo shirt and pants, prowling the building's halls and stairwells. Most of the time, his gun is cocked -- ready to fire. Alexis went on to kill 12 people that day and wound four others. The same shotgun on which he had written ""My ELF"" contained other etchings as well. The words: ""End to the torment!"" ""Not what y'all say!"" And ""Better off this way!"" At some point during his rampage, Alexis picked up a Beretta handgun. He exchanged gunfire with law enforcement officers a few times during the more than hourlong ordeal, which ended at 9:25 a.m. with Alexis shot dead on the third floor. Alexis had arrived in the capital area on August 25 for a contracting project, a few weeks after he told police in Newport, Rhode Island, that he'd heard ""voices"" emanating from the walls of hotels he'd been staying at. Once in Washington, he stayed at two suburban hotels before settling into a Residence Inn in the city on September 7. Two days later, Alexis began his contracting job based at the Navy Yard. On the first Saturday after that, he was at a Northern Virginia shooting range and gun store -- where he purchased the Remington 870. Flags in shooter's past apparently not red enough . FBI: Shooter did not target specific victims . A manager raised a performance-related issue with Alexis the previous Friday, but Parlave said that there is no indication this incident spurred any notable reaction. In fact, when he began shooting, it appears he wasn't picky about his victims. ""We have not determined there to be any previous relationship between Alexis and any of the victims,"" the FBI official said. With his contractor status -- not to mention he was a former Navy reservist -- few questioned that Alexis legitimately gained access to the Navy Yard the morning of the fateful shooting. Still, some have asked whether he should have had such access, given his mental health and criminal history. Tackling the military's insider threat . The latter includes a 2004 arrest in Seattle, when he was accused of shooting the tires of a man's truck in an anger-fueled ""blackout,"" according to a police report. Alexis' father told police his son had anger management problems associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, which he suffered after working ""as an active participant in rescue attempts"" during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York. Another arrest came in August 2008 in DeKalb County, Georgia, on a disorderly conduct charge. Two years later, Alexis was arrested in Fort Worth, Texas -- but never charged --  over an allegation that he fired a gun through the ceiling of his apartment. That was the year, 2010, that the Navy moved to discharge Alexis due to what military officials described as a ""pattern of misconduct"" including insubordination, disorderly conduct, unauthorized absences from work and at least one instance of drunkenness. But due to a lack of evidence, he was instead given an honorable discharge. Then there was his mental state, including last month's incident in Newport, Rhode Island. Alexis also sought help at two Veterans Affairs hospitals in and around Washington for sleep-related issues, according to law enforcement sources. Who were the victims? HP drops subcontractor Alexis worked for . Despite all this, Alexis still managed to find work at The Experts for about six months over the past year. That company said the last of two background checks it conducted in June on Alexis ""revealed no issues other than one minor traffic violation."" Like the military, The Experts has come under criticism for not recognizing Alexis as a potential problem or threat. A Hewlett-Packard spokesman told CNN on Wednesday the technology company -- citing its policy of adhering ""to the highest standards of business practices and ethics"" -- had dropped The Experts as a subcontractor. ""Based on what we now know about The Experts' conduct, including its failure to respond appropriately to Aaron Alexis' mental health issues and certain incidents recently reported in the press, HP has terminated its relationship with The Experts,"" the spokesman said. The Experts responded, in a statement, saying it was ""disappointed' by HP's decision and insisting it has met ""all of our contractual obligations."" ""The Experts had no greater insight into Alexis' mental health than HP, particularly given that an HP site manager closely supervised him, including during the events in Rhode Island,"" the company said. 1 dead in Long Island workplace shooting . FBI takes heat over video release . The FBI was criticized Wednesday night, both by Defense Department officials and victims' families following the release of the video. ""People in DoD are furious that FBI and other law enforcement officials unnecessarily put out this video footage today.  It only adds to the pain of the families and brought life back to a killer,"" a senior Pentagon official told CNN. ""Outside of law enforcement channels, the video was not viewed."" Another Defense Department official described the release as ""gratuitous,"" indicating there was nothing to be gained from the release. Law enforcement officials said they reached all but one of the victims' families to inform them beforehand. And officials at the FBI argued that the video clarified various conflicting reports about the timeline of events, and would help to dispel various pieces of misinformation, including one incorrect story that the shooter was looking for specific victims. Ronald Hosko, assistant director of the FBI's Criminal Division, said what was released was a far less painful version of the graphic video collected by authorities. Navy leadership said that while officials knew the footage would be released, they were not told of the content. It is not known if anyone in Pentagon leadership had expressed their views with the FBI or Justice Department. Sources also told CNN that the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, an arm of the Navy, was part of the decision regarding the distribution of the video, and saw the footage before it was released. One victims' family reacted with equal dismay. ""I'm in total shock after reviewing the video. We have not even had time to begin to grieve,"" Theodore Hisey told CNN Wednesday evening, saying his family did not know the FBI was about to release the video. His sister-in-law, Mary Francis Knight, was one of the 12 killed by Alexis.

"President Barack Obama isn't ceding ground on his most controversial policies despite an election that delivered a stinging rebuke to him and his party on Capitol Hill. During a roughly 90-minute press conference Wednesday, Obama gave no sign that he'd accept major revisions to his signature health care law, change his mind on bypassing Congress on immigration or consent to Republican demands on energy and the environment. Indeed, the President didn't do much to suggest that his White House would work differently after Republicans won at least 52 seats in the Senate and their biggest majority in the House since World War II. While Obama made clear he had no desire to reshape his agenda, he did acknowledge that voters dealt his party a dramatic defeat on Tuesday. ""To those of you who voted, I hear you,"" Obama said in his first public remarks since the election. To those who didn't vote, ""I hear you too."" Obama avoided language like ""shellacking,"" which he used to describe losses Democrats experienced in 2010. The closest he got to accepting blame for the campaign came when he said every election result offers a ""moment for reflection."" ""There is no doubt the Republicans had a good night,"" Obama said. The success of Obama's final years in office could rely on Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is in line to become the next Senate majority leader. The two men have had an antagonistic relationship -- McConnell once vowed to make Obama a one-term president -- but have occasionally found common ground. McConnell worked closely with the administration, though mostly through Vice President Joe Biden, to broker a deal in 2012 to avert the so-called fiscal cliff. Obama reached out to McConnell on Wednesday and sounded an optimistic tone during the press conference. ""You know, actually, I would enjoy having some Kentucky bourbon with Mitch McConnell,"" Obama said. WATCH: GOP's big night in 90 seconds . Still, the distance between Obama and McConnell quickly became clear. They both identified tax reform as a potential area of compromise. But Obama described that effort by encouraging lawmakers to lower tax rates by closing loopholes -- a strategy McConnell and other Republicans have rejected for years. During a press conference in Kentucky, McConnell urged Obama to follow Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, who built domestic legacies despite often having to deal with a Congress controlled by opposing parties. McConnell said those two presidents are ""good examples of accepting the government you have rather than fantasizing about the government you wished you had."" ""The president has really got a choice,"" he said. ""There certainly are going to be areas of disagreement."" It will take time to see whether McConnell has running room from conservatives within his party who may prefer a strategy of confrontation. Obama, meanwhile, must consider how he can safeguard his own political legacy of health care reform, a Wall Street overhaul and an uneven economic recovery. But Obama insisted that the bitter polarization that has plagued his crisis-scarred presidency and turned his hair gray doesn't get him down. ""It doesn't make me mopey,"" he said. ""It energizes me, because it means that this democracy's working.""","Obama spoke for the first time since the election .

"(CNN)  -- Tennis great Jimmy Connors was arrested outside the campus arena where UC Santa Barbara and top-ranked North Carolina were playing a basketball game. Connors was reportedly arrested as he attended a college basketball game in California. The eight-time Grand Slam champion was taken into custody on Friday night after refusing to comply with an order to leave an area near the entrance of the Thunderdome following a confrontation, police said in a statement. A Santa Barbara County jail employee said Connors was booked and released but did not have details. Connors could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. Connors is one of the all-time greats of the sport, having been ranked as world number one for five consecutive years in the 1970s. He was also renowned for his fiery temperament on the court as he battled his way to 109 career titles. The 56-year-old returned to the mainstream tennis fold by acting as coach to American number one Andy Roddick, but their two-year relationship ended earlier this year.

"(CNN) -- News that debris was found after an Indonesia AirAsia flight went missing over the weekend marked the third major incident involving Southeast Asian airlines this year. In March, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing after it mysteriously deviated from its scheduled flight path from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The plane is believed to have been lost over the southern Indian Ocean near Australia, yet no wreckage has been found. Then, in July, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine -- possibly by pro-Russian separatists, although Russia suggested that Ukraine was in some way responsible. So, are passengers traveling in Southeast Asia rattled? The latest incident has certainly fanned concern that travelers might lose confidence in regional airlines altogether, particularly Malaysian carriers. Yet although Flight QZ8501 was an AirAsia flight, it was operated by Indonesia AirAsia, which is not a Malaysian airline and is instead majority-owned by Indonesian interests. (The AirAsia group has similar minority holdings in subsidiaries in Thailand, the Philippines, India, and, soon, Japan, although these subsidiary airlines use the AirAsia brand). Yet while travelers will likely be somewhat unsettled by this year's developments, AirAsia will probably weather this difficult period. After all, the group pioneered the low-cost model in Asia, and has built a strong reputation for affordable and safe flying. Until the QZ8501 incident, more than 200 million passengers had flown on the AirAsia network, including its long-haul arm AirAsia X, with no plane having been lost. Led by its formidable founder and CEO Tony Fernandes, the airline has built a reputation as the champion of the average passenger in the face of more expensive full-service carriers. Missing planes and air disasters: How bad was 2014? In the process, the airline has won the loyalty and gratitude of millions of working-class Asians for whom flying has become an affordable reality. It is therefore unlikely that recent unfortunate incidents will be able to change this. What about rivals swooping in to pick up the business? The reality is that there is no pan-Asian low-cost competitor with operations on the scale of AirAsia's. Indeed, because of restrictions in most countries in the region that prohibit foreigners from holding majority stakes in local airlines, AirAsia has had to improvise by establishing minority-owned subsidiaries all over Asia. And, although these are technically separate airlines, their common branding and Internet booking platform ensures that there is only one AirAsia in most passengers' minds. That said, the way AirAsia manages the crisis will also be critical in determining its future. So far, the consensus seems to be that Fernandes is faring pretty well by being open, forthright and consistent with the families and media. However, much will ultimately depend on what actually happened to Flight QZ8501. If it is determined to have been a weather-related accident, as has been widely suggested, the traveling public is likely to see this as a one-off event that can eventually be overlooked. It will only be if the airline itself is found to be somehow at fault -- or perhaps if the cause of the incident remains unexplained -- that there may be some lingering concerns among passengers. All this said, air transport is undergoing phenomenal growth in Asia, with the region poised to overtake North America as the world's largest and most dynamic aviation market. This suggests that the three, likely unrelated, incidents this year should not warrant sweeping generalizations or suggestions that airlines in the region have somehow become less safe than airlines elsewhere. Of course, such incidents should still serve to remind airlines and governments everywhere that safety is of paramount importance, and that the explosive growth of air travel must also be accompanied by stringent safety and security standards. But for now, passengers in Southeast Asia are savvy enough to understand the difference between a trend and tragic but isolated accidents.","Alan Khee-Jin Tan: Flight QZ8501 stirs fears passengers might lose confidence .

"The artificially chilled halls of the U.S. Capitol this week are a sort of an out-of-body experience. Thoughts of the month-long August break from Washington permeate nearly every encounter and phone call. It is as if lawmakers have been strapped to their desks for months. But a CNN analysis shows Congress has spent less time on Capitol Hill so far this year than in any of the previous five years. House members have been in Washington for 56% of all non-holiday weekdays -- essentially, fewer than three days a week. Senators have walked into the Capitol for 61% of weekdays. The weeks are not just shorter, but consistently so. The Senate did not have a single five-day work week in Washington for the first seven months of the year. The House had two. Boehner juggles assault on Obamacare, avoiding shutdown . CNN counted days that lawmakers were in Washington excluding ""pro-forma"" sessions, which are technically considered work days but last only a few minutes and are usually ignored by members. The number of congressional work days now is significantly less than the high point of 2009. That's when the Senate met for 113 days before the August recess, which is 24 days more than the same period this year. The House met for 19 more days in 2009 compared to this year. At that time, Barack Obama was just beginning his presidency and Democrats led both chambers and pushed an aggressive agenda. The time spent by members in Washington dropped sharply the following year and has decreased nearly every year since with each party controlling one house and partisanship defining the political climate. CNN Money: Congress OKs cheaper student loans . So Congress is definitely in Washington less.  But there is a debate over how much that matters. Longtime congressman Lee Hamilton takes one view. Strongly. ""They don't spend enough time in Washington,"" he said, frustrated, ""They don't get to know each other. When they do interact, they are often in confrontational settings. ... Legislation is a very complex process. It takes a lot of time, a lot of give-and-take and you cannot force it."" Hamilton, a Democrat who served in the House from 1965 to 1999, now runs the Center on Congress at Indiana University. He believes the shorter window in Washington squeezes out the heavy lifting of lawmaking and that a lawmaker's hours in the Capitol are filled with meet-and-greets, fundraisers and receptions instead of legislative work. ""It got to the point when I was there,"" Hamilton recalled, ""that I had 15 appointments on Tuesdays. You can't get legislating done in that environment."" But others question whether more time in Washington would change anything. ""I can't imagine that they'd be anymore productive if they were here more,"" said Mike Tanner, senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute.  ""It's not like they do a lot when they're here."" Tanner stresses that most major legislation is currently worked out behind closed doors by a few leaders and members of each chamber. While some in Congress, like Rep. Scott Rigell, R-Virginia, want to cancel August recess and force a work session, Tanner thinks such a move would achieve nothing. ""Sitting here in August while the leadership meets behind closed doors wouldn't do much,"" he concluded. Gamesmanship intensifies as Congress approaches August recess . Members of Congress themselves seem divided. ""The real problem is that when we're here, we're not doing anything,"" said Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon. ""You're actually better off back home because you can work with people, you can deal with the folks you represent, deal with their questions and gather more information ... for when people decide when we are going to get back to work."" But fellow Democrat Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Illinois, when asked if Congress needs to be in Washington more replied, ""Yeah, I think it's important we address the challenges we face as a country.  The reason I came here was to tackle those challenges."" Conservatives like Tanner are happy for Congress to stay out of town, theorizing that a better government is one that does less. The office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, which schedules the calendar in that chamber, defended the time away from Washington. ""It's critical for members to have district work periods to hear from their constituents on a variety of matters,"" said Cantor spokeswoman Megan Whittemore, ""including chronic unemployment, the next steps toward addressing immigration and our debt crisis."" Whittemore stressed that the House has been active, passing legislation on student loans, job training, the Keystone pipeline, cybersecurity and other measures. The office of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid did not respond to CNN's questions about that chamber's schedule. Whatever votes either chamber has taken, neither has found time to fully deal with two looming fiscal crises. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has indicated the nation could hit its borrowing limit as soon as Labor Day.  And funding for much of the federal government is due to run out on September 30, raising the possibility of a government shutdown without a resolution. As Congress leaves for August recess, most funding bills remain in limbo and there is no outline or even talks over how to address the borrowing limit, or debt ceiling. CNNMoney: Debt ceiling awaits . Some say that when members return in September, the logistics of the calendar will make things harder. ""(The schedule) is very poorly arranged to get things done,"" said Bill Galston, chair of the Brookings Institution's Governance Studies Program.  ""It's a series of starts and stops, punctuated by flights to and from fundraisers and their districts."" Galston and a bipartisan organization he works with called ""No Labels"" would rather see Congress stay in town for three consecutive weeks and then recess for a full week. That's similar to what House Republicans initially planned when they took over the chamber - two weeks in Washington and one week at home. Instead, though, the 2013 House calendar is dotted with small clusters of time and, as CNN found, a rate of being in town of 56 percent. That is the average, for long spans of time it can be less.  In January, for example, the House was in the capital just seven days. The Senate 10.

"Several mass graves have been discovered, at least 1,000 people are dead and tens of thousands have been displaced in South Sudan as a recent outbreak of inter-ethnic violence has Africa's newest nation on the brink of civil war and possibly genocide. At the time of South Sudan's independence in July of 2011 -- free from Sudan and recovering from decades of civil war -- hopes were high. Southern Sudanese referred to their new country as the Promised Land.  There were fears that Sudan might seek to undermine the new nation's stability, but analysts cautioned the greatest threats to peace could come from within the country's own borders. As tensions rise between the South Sudan's two largest ethnic groups, the Dinka and Nuer, commentators are now recalling the events in Rwanda with reference to this crisis. Twenty years ago, in the New Year of 1994, reports warned of the threat of genocide in Rwanda as the radical Hutu government incited hatred against the Tutsi. Less than six months later, the government of Rwanda had organized the murder of their Tutsi civilians, leaving around a million dead. Preventing a devastating civil war from gripping South Sudan is urgent, but focus must also be given to preventing genocide, which is a high risk should instability in the country deepen. The intentional nature of genocide and the attempt to destroy groups based on their ethnic, religious or national identity, make it a uniquely horrific crime and one that the international community has committed itself to prevent and punish. Fear of escalating violence in South Sudan has led the United Nations Security Council to increase the peace-keeping operation in Sudan by a further 5,500 personnel. In the experience of one of the authors, who lost many of his family in Rwanda 1994, they are right to do so. According to genocide scholar, Barbara Harff, the risk of mass atrocities increases with political instability, the existence of an autocratic regime, a dominating ethnic group and previous genocide or massacres. All of these factors were present in Rwanda preceding the genocide and are now present in South Sudan. Should South Sudan become entrenched in civil war, the risk of mass atrocities occurring will increase significantly. While the parallels between Rwanda and South Sudan are not identical, they share some of the same warning signs, which we have outlined below: . The current crisis in South Sudan began as a power struggle between President Salva Kiir, originating from Sudan's Dinka majority, and its former Vice President Riek Machar of the Nuer tribe. Machar was ousted from his position by Kiir in July along with the rest of the cabinet. The situation came to a violent head on December 15 when rival army factions loyal to the two leaders first clashed in the country's capital of Juba. The conflict has since spread throughout several states. Both sides have been accused of targeting members of the opposing ethnic group. While different in the detail, power struggles mixed with an ethnic dimension was a feature in Rwanda in 1994. Aside from the civil war, in which the Tutsi dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front were attempting to oust the Hutu Power government, there was an extremist factions within the ruling Hutu regime who consolidated its power by killing many Hutu opposition members as that same time as the genocide against the Tutsi began. Massacres have already taken place in South Sudan. As we saw in Rwanda, massacres of Tutsis occurred long before all out genocide, but failed to be seem as an alarm. In South Sudan, the discovery of one mass grave in the town of Bentiu and two more outside of the capital should be viewed as indication of what could continue or escalate if the situation stays on its current trajectory. In a concerning development, an armed rebel militia has now entered the fray in South Sudan. The militia -- known as the ""White Army"" for dusting their bodies with ash -- is reportedly composed of 25,000 Nuer youth and is suspected of being aligned with the rebel army and Machar. The White Army attacked a United Nations peacekeeping base that was sheltering civilians, killing several peacekeepers on December 19. The group has been known to make statements about their intent to wipe out members of rival ethnic groups. In Rwanda, a militia aligned with the Hutu-led government known as the Interhamwe, expressed a similar ideology to the White Army and was harnessed by the political leaders to commit genocide. The root causes of the crisis in South Sudan are deep set, but not insurmountable. While there are differences in the context of the two crises, Rwanda's not too distant past provides a warning that there is no time for complacency in South Sudan. But, we should not only look back 20 years for lessons. South Sudan should look to Rwanda 20 years after the genocide to see how governance, rule of law and leadership have enabled development. South Sudan could learn also how in Rwanda, resilience against violence is being reinforced at a community level through peace education that works to overcome the hostility and fear between groups and to develop an identity and purpose based not on tribe, but on the nation. To do this takes true leadership from all concerned. Let us hope, that for the sake of South Sudan's people, their leaders will not come to realize the solution to creating sustainable peace after countless dead have been buried.

"Washington (CNN)Chris Christie's decision to accept a plane ride and a box seat at Sunday's Dallas Cowboys game has Democrats considering an investigation and even some Republicans questioning the New Jersey governor's judgment. On Wednesday, the co-chairman of the New Jersey legislative panel investigating the Bridgegate scandal told CNN that he is considering an inquiry into whether it was appropriate for the governor to accept free tickets from Cowboys owner Jerry Jones after a company the team has a stake in was awarded a contract supported by Christie. ""It smacks of improper behavior. It smacks of hypocrisy,"" Assemblyman John Wisniewski said. ""It smacks of inside deals that the average guy in Jersey can't ever dream of having the opportunity to do. It's wrong."" Christie, a lifelong Cowboys fan, said through a spokesman that Jones paid for the ticket and transportation to the game. The spokesman said Monday that the governor's code of conduct allows Christie to accept gifts ""from relatives or personal friends that are paid for with personal funds."" But the revelation Tuesday that the Cowboys own part of a company that won a Port Authority of New York and New Jersey contract, which was endorsed by Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, raised questions about a possible quid-pro-quo. Last March, Legends Hospitality, which is owned by the Cowboys, New York Yankees and the Checketts Partners Investment Fund, won the Port Authority contract to operate the observation deck of One World Trade Center. Related: Christie's cowboy's love gets national spotlight . Why would a big state governor with White House ambitions accept lavish gifts from a wealthy patron? That's a question Virginia's former Gov. Bob McDonnell will probably be asking himself as he heads to prison Feb. 9 after being handed a two-year sentence for public corruption conviction on Tuesday. McDonnell accepted cash and gifts from a wealthy businessman with interests in his state. Related: Former Virginia governor gets two years in prison . In the case of Christie and his Cowboys, there's no evidence of any wrongdoing. But Democrats like Brad Woodhouse of the progressive American Democracy Legal Fund are quick to draw the comparison. Woodhouse filed a complaint with the New Jersey State Ethics Commission and the governor's Advisory Ethics Panel this week, arguing that ""Christie's acceptance of gifts from Mr. Jones ... appears to violate at least two separate provisions of New Jersey's Conflicts of Interest Law, the New Jersey Uniform Ethics Code, and the Governor's Code of Conduct."" Christie spokeswoman Maria Comella said that it's not surprising that a partisan organization is ""using the governor's support of a football team for a political hit."" ""The governor does not involve himself in Port Authority bidding processes,"" she said. ""He's only there because he's a huge Dallas Cowboys fan. And Jerry Jones wants him there because he's good luck."" Related: Cowboys, books tours and same-sex marriage . Indeed, Jones told a Dallas radio station Tuesday that, ""He's part of our mojo and I want him there all the way. I'll tell you, if he's got enough mojo to pull this thing out, he ought to be looked at as president of the United States."" But even some Republicans are questioning Christie's decision to watch the game from the owner's box. Former Republican state Sen. Bill Schluter, who served on the State Ethics Commission, said Christie was offered the tickets because of his position as governor, which ""just doesn't pass the smell test."" ""I just wonder if the governor hasn't given up his idea of being president. For him to do this, to go out to Dallas to see this game, doesn't show good judgment,"" he said. It's a point Woodhouse, a former spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, echoed. ""It really defies the imagination that someone who sees himself as running for president would act this way,"" he said. ""It doesn't look like someone who's on a national stage ready for primetime.""","New Jersey Gov.

"(CNN)When Jaime FlorCruz, CNN's Beijing bureau chief, arrived in China on August 21, 1971, he says it was akin to visiting North Korea today. The country was midway through the turmoil of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. Universities and schools were just re-opening and students brandishing little red books toiled in factories or on farms. FlorCruz, then a firebrand student leader from the Philippines on a study tour, found himself stuck in China after his name was placed on a blacklist by then Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos. Fearing arrest as martial law was declared in his home country in September 1972, he stayed on along with four others from the study tour. A year later his passport expired, leaving him temporarily stateless. ""The idea was to come for three weeks and see what was going on,"" he says. ""I'm an accidental tourist."" He ended up staying for more than four decades and launching a career as a journalist just as China began opening up to the world. On his day of retirement from CNN, he reflects on his ""ring side ticket"" to China's rise: . What was life like under Mao? When it became clear we were staying in China, we wanted to study but universities weren't ready to enroll foreign students, so we asked to work. Our hosts didn't make us, but we insisted. I worked on a state farm in Hunan province. Initially, I found it a romantic idea but it didn't take long for the romance to wear off. At the end of the day, we carved out two hours to learn Chinese. Our interpreter was our teacher and by the end of those few months on the farm I could converse in Chinese. From late 1972, I worked on a fishing boat for two years. We'd go out on the high seas for five or six days at a time on two trawler ships pulling a huge net. It was a spartan life, very simple. It was sometimes bleak but often also exciting because of the political campaigns that were going on. We would only watch from the sidelines -- see posters and in private discussions with Chinese friends. We were told not to get involved. Tell us about some of your memories of university and your circle of classmates. I was in the class of 1977 -- the first class when college students were enrolled through a nationwide entrance examination. Among my cohorts was current Premier Li Keqiang; he studied law. Also among them was Bo Xilai, once one of the most powerful politicians in China, now disgraced and sentenced to life in prison for corruption and abuse of power. He was in my world history class. We would stand in the cafeteria holding our bowls of food -- there were no chairs to sit on -- and he dared to come close to foreign students like me. He knew enough English to chat with me and even then was quite charismatic and opinionated. A lot of that batch of fellow students are now in important roles in the government bureaucracy. Some are top professors, scientists and entrepreneurs. I've kept friends with many of them. They've been good sounding boards. You've witnessed the trial of the Gang of Four, the Tiananmen Massacre and the Olympics. What else stands out? I covered Wham's concert, the first Western pop group to perform in China. It was attended by thousands of Beijing residents, most of whom just looked perplexed. Police looked on sternly if anyone stood up to cheer and dance. I remember when Coca Cola went on sale for the first time -- people thought it tasted like a Chinese medicine concoction. Later on, it was a big treat to interview Yao Ming when he chosen as the number one NBA draft. I'm a huge basketball fan and Yao turned out to be a humble and affable guy although I got a sore neck. When I was at TIME, my big scoop was breaking the news of Jiang Qing's (Mao's widow who went on trial as part of the Gang of Four) suicide several days before it was reported by Xinhua. But to be honest scoops like that were rare and perhaps less important than providing accurate and fair reports and analysis day after day, week after week. You're the longest-serving foreign correspondent in China.  How has covering the country changed? It's easier than it used to be in the 1980s. There was a then 10-day rule that required us to give notice if we wanted to leave Beijing. Technically, except for Tibet, we can now go anywhere as long as someone invited us. In recent years though, there have been signs of tightening. Many colleagues, including our own crew, have had brushes with authorities -- the hand in front of the camera. CNN comes under heavy scrutiny because it's so closely associated with the United States and we have been accused of biased reporting on China. I've had to explain to officials here that we're not an extension of U.S. government; we are independent. We report it as we see it. China is a much wealthier place than when you first arrived. Have all the changes you've seen since the 1970s been for the better? I echo what my Chinese friends would say. They enjoy much more personal freedom -- the freedom to travel, to choose where to live, to marry whoever they wish, to take a job or quit a job. Freedom of speech and expression has it limits but most people know where the red line lies. Of course, there are problems. Many are the unintended consequences of the reform that started 30 years ago like environmental pollution and degradation -- and the lack of a spiritual anchor for most Chinese. I see a nation of 1.3 billion seemingly rudderless, looking for direction and meaning in their lives, even those who are rich. It's not a big secret. I think the government acknowledges this crisis of faith. You've lived in China for 40 years and raised a family here. How do you feel about it? I've lived here 43 years, I've seen where it came from. I appreciate all the quotidian changes. I tend to look at China as a glass half full rather than half empty because I've seen it virtually empty. It was my refuge and later my training and battle ground as journalist. I feel bittersweet to be ending my time here as a foreign correspondent. It's been a rewarding experience and not really the end. I'll still be involved in China watching, in China, or wherever my next projects and adventures take me. In the next few months, my wife Ana and I will stay on in Beijing, where she is gainfully employed. For a change, I will be the ""trailing spouse"" but later I hope to do a bit of writing and speechifying. Should you leave China, what will you miss about it? China's been my second home, although it will never replace the Philippines as my homeland. I'll definitely not miss the Beijing smog, but will certainly miss the quaint, old neighborhood nearby, including the men who belt out visceral shouts early in the morning, their way of exercise, my wake-up call. I'll miss the guttural accent of the Beijing taxi drivers and their unsolicited opinions. I'll miss the food --jianbing, zhajiangmian, Peking duck -- and, yes, my periodic foot massage. Of course, I'll miss my friends, who've accepted me as a virtual Beijing Ren (Beijinger). What's your advice for journalists in China? The best stories are often of ordinary people doing extraordinary deeds. Keep up the good fight for fair, honest and nuanced reporting. China has changed dramatically. I feel fortunate to have been in the right place at the right time to have witnessed these changes up close. For better or worse, China now is a major player in the world. I never imagined China could be so prosperous, powerful and proud. Whatever China does, or does not do, has impact on global affairs and our lives. For our sake, and China's too, I hope China will emerge as a peace-loving global power.

"There's been a lot of news over the past few days about the hacker collective Anonymous. Last Friday, the group claimed to have posted an internal FBI conference call discussing investigations into Anonymous and the FBI acknowledged the call was intended to be private. This week, Anonymous posted e-mails that it claims are from an adviser to the Syrian president, suggesting how Bashar al-Assad could downplay violence in the country when he was interviewed by Barbara Walters last summer. So who is Anonymous? Consider its motto: ""We are Legion."" In strict Merriam-Webster terms, legion means a group of fighters, a faceless army more powerful as a whole than each individual. Still maddeningly vague enough for you? That's the point. Anonymous takes great pains to be undefinable and amorphous. Because its members are impossible to isolate as a single thing, they've been called pranksters and criminals. Some have dismissed them as nerds with too much free time. There are others, though, who contend Anonymous is the future form of Internet-based social activism. They laud the ""hactivists"" for their actions. Wired has called Anonymous a culture, complete with its own ""aesthetics and values, art and literature, social norms and ways of production, and even its own dialectic language."" As for the literal operation of Anonymous, becoming part of it is as simple as going onto its Internet Relay Chat forums and typing away. There are numerous Twitter accounts which claim to be affiliated with Anonymous, and more websites that post and repost (known as mirroring) Anonymous content than there is room to mention here. The real-life people involved in Anonymous could be behind their laptops anywhere, from an Internet café in Malaysia to a Michigan suburb. Anonymous appears to have no spokesperson or leader. One could participate for a minute or a day in a chat room, and then never go back again. It is poor etiquette to ask in a chat forum for real names or identifying information behind someone's IM handle. You just trust that the others' intentions, for the most part, are to serve the whole. Online discussions can eventually wind toward a ""vote"" on whether to go after a target, which anyone in the chat can suggest, according to Gregg Housh, a Boston web developer who's tried to explain Anonymous on many media outlets, including CNN.com. He says he's not a spokesperson for Anonymous and that he merely observes Anonymous chats but doesn't participate in its activities. ""If the group at that given time decides to go after a website and take it down, then that happens,"" he said. ""If the majority of the people chatting disagree and make their case, then it won't happen."" It's an uphill battle verifying information for stories about Anonymous. Law enforcement is in an equally tricky spot when pursuing Anonymous participants if authorities believe they have violated the law. There have been several arrests involving alleged Anonymous members, several of them teenagers. Over the past two years, Anonymous has been known primarily for attacks called DDOS, short for distributed denial of service, a kind of network stress test in which each attacker gives consent to have his or her computer linked to a bot net. The force of all those computers working together, focused on one site, overwhelms the targeted site's server and consequently disrupts or takes the site down. DDOSing is the Internet equivalent of standing behind a much bigger guy in a fight that you've started because you could never win the fight alone. Anonymous most recently claimed to take offline sites belonging to the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice after an announcement that Megaupload fans were arrested. (What is Megaupload?) DDOS attacks made Anonymous famous in 2010 when it targeted the sites of MasterCard, Visa and PayPal. Anonymous claimed online that it was lashing out at the corporations because they had stopped doing business with WikiLeaks. Read more about Operation Payback. In 2010, WikiLeaks leaked hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. intelligence documents on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well nearly a quarter million State Department cables. WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange said at the time that he had no affiliation with Anonymous and nothing to do with the attacks. Since then Anonymous has branched out across the world, or at least caught the attention of hackers everywhere. In November, it claimed in an online video to have obtained information about people in Mexico who were leading double lives as drug cartel helpers. Anonymous never released that information, yet by that time the sensational claim itself had drawn a huge amount of media attention to the group. Anonymous grabbed many other headlines in 2011, notably claiming that it attacked government websites in Tunisia and Egypt as a way to show support for protesters during Arab Spring uprisings. A video -- laced with Anonymous' typical computer-voiceover -- appeared online during the January 2011 revolution. It threatened Egyptian authorities if they attempted to censor Internet access and other freedoms. ""Anonymous is you. You will not be denied your right to free speech, free press, free association and your universal right to freely access information both in real life and on the Internet,"" the voice said. Anonymous had a hand in organizing and agitating in the Occupy movement throughout 2011. Protesters have been seen at Occupy demonstrations across the globe wearing Anonymous' distinctive Guy Fawkes mask, the same icon that appeared this week on sites carrying the alleged e-mails related to Syria.","Anonymous is an amorphous collective of hackers that are hard to define .

"It was late on a Friday night and a freckled, blue-eyed University of Virginia student named Hannah Graham was partying in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia. Graham, described as an accomplished athlete and straight-A student, was seen various times before her disappearance in the early hours of September 13, according to a timeline compiled by CNN affiliate WVIR. She was at a party and later at an apartment complex blocks away. A surveillance camera caught her outside a pub, where she was turned away. She was seen running past a gas station at one point and later spotted at a restaurant. At another point, she had drinks with a man at a bar. Jesse Matthew, the man named as a suspect in her disappearance, was taken into custody this week in Texas, 1,300 miles away from the town where Graham was last seen. On Friday, Matthew, who had waived extradition, was transported to Virginia and booked into jail, authorities said. Almost two weeks after her disappearance, people keep asking: Where is Hannah Graham? Last weekend, more than 1,200 volunteers and Virginia Department of Emergency Management officials searched for clues that would lead them to Graham, CNN affiliate WTVR reported. On Saturday, the search for Graham extended to rural areas outside Charlottesville, spanning more than 740 square miles in Albemarle County. Police also asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land. The search may have to be extended to the 1,300 miles between the place where Graham was last seen and Texas, where Matthew was arrested. ""We're going to do whatever we can to assist Virginia to locate that young lady,"" Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset told reporters Thursday, adding that deputies will start searching in the area where Matthew was arrested and branch out. Authorities found Matthew on a Galveston County beach. Deputies were tipped off to his whereabouts when they got a call about a suspicious person camping on the beach. One responded and ran the license plate of that person's vehicle. It came back as wanted, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. The former Liberty University student and football player did not resist arrest, Trochesset told reporters. The sheriff added that investigators from Virginia were examining a car and a tent found at Matthew's campsite. ""There's a long road ahead of us, and that long road includes finding Hannah Graham,"" Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo said. Authorities are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of Graham. Her parents attended a candlelight vigil Thursday night organized by University of Virginia students. The couple said it was ""extremely moving."" ""We were comforted by the evident high esteem in which our cherished daughter is held by her many friends at the University of Virginia and beyond,"" John and Sue Graham said in a statement. ""We continue to be optimistic that Hannah will soon be returned safely to us."" Holding a stuffed bunny named BB, his daughter's favorite plush toy and ""guardian angel,"" John Graham last weekend pleaded for someone to come forward with information on his daughter, who he said loved helping people. The couple hasn't given up hope. ""They are hurt,"" Longo said. ""They are concerned. They are frustrated. But not for one second have I discerned that they have ever lost hope they will find their daughter."" What will happen to Matthew? Matthew is accused of abduction with the intent to defile in the Graham case. Matthew's father spoke publicly for the first time Thursday. He said his son would not have harmed Graham. ""For a big man, he's as gentle as they come,"" Jesse Matthew Sr. told CNN affiliate WTVR. ""The only thing I could see, him, maybe trying to give the girl a ride or help her out. ""To kill or hurt somebody, that's not my son."" Matthew also was questioned in connection with an alleged sexual assault nearly 12 years ago, authorities said Thursday. But no charges were filed because the woman didn't want to go forward with the case and investigators determined there wasn't enough evidence to arrest Matthew, said Michael Doucette, the commonwealth's attorney for Lynchburg, Virginia. According to a statement from Lynchburg police, the woman reported she was raped on the campus of Liberty University on October 17, 2002. Matthew told authorities that the woman consented, Doucette said, adding that there were no witnesses. Matthew's Virginia-based lawyer had little to say about his client when approached this week outside his Charlottesville office. ""I am Mr. Matthew's attorney,"" James Camblos said. ""I was hired on Saturday. That's the only thing that I'm going to confirm at this point. The family and I -- nobody is making any statements at this point in time. We might later on, but right now we are not."" Matthew willingly went to a police station last weekend, along with several family members, walking through the front door and asking for a lawyer, Longo said. There was no warrant for his arrest at that time. Matthew and the lawyer spoke and then left, the police chief said, giving detectives no clearer picture of what may have happened the day Graham disappeared. Authorities searched Matthew's apartment and car but have declined to say what -- if anything -- was found. Where was Graham last seen? On the evening of September 12, she was seen at a party before friends saw her at an apartment complex a couple of blocks away. That was shortly before midnight, according to WVIR. About 12:45 a.m. on September 13, a surveillance camera caught her outside a pub, about three-quarters of a mile from the apartment complex. A doorman turned her away at the pub, Longo said. Ten minutes later, she was seen running past a gas station -- no one appeared to be pursuing her -- and witnesses said they saw her five minutes later roughly four blocks from the gas station, WVIR reported. She was at a restaurant in an area known as Downtown Mall, witnesses said. A surveillance camera at an Italian cafe captured her walking along the mall about 1:06 a.m. A camera at a jewelry store recorded her passing two minutes later, WVIR reported. At 1:20 a.m., she texted her friends to say she was lost and trying to find a party, WVIR reported. She and a man were seen having drinks at a bar between 1:30 and 2 a.m., WVIR reports. She may have been under the influence of alcohol, Longo said, and may have been vulnerable or unable to defend herself. Did Matthew fraternize with Graham at a Charlottesville restaurant? Brice Cunningham, owner of Tempo Restaurant and Wine Bar in Charlottesville, told CNN that he saw Matthew at his restaurant on the night of Graham's disappearance. ""I did not see her,"" he said. ""That's one of the most distressing matters for me."" Authorities said at least one person saw Graham at the restaurant that night. Cunningham recalled seeing Matthew alone. He said Matthew came to Tempo twice that night. ""He was having a good time,"" Cunningham said. ""He went dancing. I thought he was just a little bit excited and happy to be there."" A Tempo employee at the door, however, saw Graham outside the restaurant, Cunningham said. ""Yes, walking away with him,"" Cunningham said of Matthew. ""It would appear that they knew each other."" Longo said what happened over the next 40 or so hours until Graham was reported missing is crucial. ""There is this block of time,"" he said. ""This very big, large, significant block of time between the time we know Hannah Graham disappeared and the time that disappearance was reported to us. We need to shrink that gap."" Authorities say they think people who know Matthew may be helpful in the search for Graham. ""If you know Jesse, and many people do because Jesse grew up here,"" Longo said. ""He went to school here. He has family here. He went to church here. He worked here. Lots of people know Jesse.""","Jesse Matthew has been sent to Virginia .

"Some official North Korean Internet and social media sites appeared Thursday to have been hacked, possibly by the hacker collective Anonymous. The hacking -- including an image skewering North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on an official Flickr account -- comes amid rising tensions between North Korea and several other countries including the United States. The North Korean government website Uriminzokkiri.com was down Thursday morning, and the official @uriminzok Twitter account -- also apparently tampered with -- has messages claiming that Uriminzokkiri, the Flickr site and other North Korean sites have been hacked. Among the pictures on the Flickr account Thursday: A ""wanted"" poster with an image showing Kim with a pig's ears and nose. The poster accuses Kim of ""threatening world peace with ICBMs and nuclear weapons."" Another image reads: ""We are Anonymous."" On the Twitter account, the usual image atop the page was replaced with one that reads ""tango down"" -- military slang that has been appropriated by hackers to say they have interrupted service to a website. The image also shows dancers wearing Guy Fawkes masks. The mask is a favorite symbol of the hacker collective. If it is the work of Anonymous, it would be appear to be just the latest attack by the group against North Korean sites. Last week, Anonymous, upon leaking account information from Uriminzokkiri.com, announced it would continue to hack North Korean sites if the government didn't ""stop making nukes and nuke-threats,"" according to CNET. The group also demanded the resignation of Kim, democracy in North Korea, and uncensored Internet access for all North Koreans, CNET reported. Known for its DDOS, or distributed denial of service, attacks that take websites offline, Anonymous has taken up a number of causes. It  had a hand in organizing and agitating in the Occupy movement throughout 2011. It also is known for defending WikiLeaks' Julian Assange and Assange's assertion that all information should be freely available on the Internet. The hacker collective is an amorphous group that takes pride in not having a single leader or spokesperson, which makes claims by the group difficult to verify.

"(CNN) -- Google's ambitious plan to offer a 3-D street level view of communities across three continents hit a snag when angry residents of a UK village blocked the search engine's camera car from photographing their homes. Broughton, can be seen from the air on Google Earth, but not from the ground. Fearing the appearance of their well appointed properties on the Web site would attract criminals scouting for burglary targets, villagers in Broughton, north of London, summoned the police after spotting the car. ""I was upstairs when I spotted the camera car driving down the lane,"" resident Paul Jacobs told The Times of London. ""My immediate reaction was anger: How dare anyone take a photograph of my home without my consent? I ran outside to flag the car down and told the driver he was not only invading our privacy but also facilitating crime. ""This is an affluent area.

"(CNN) -- Police in Maryland are on the hunt for the perpetrator of what appears to be an April Fools' Day prank that left a man glued to a toilet at a Wal-Mart store. If caught, the jokester who doused the seat with glue at the Elkton Wal-Mart on March 31 could face second-degree assault charges, said Lt. Matthew Donnelly of the Elkton Police Department. Police, along with the Singerly Fire Co. and the Cecil County paramedics, were called to the scene at about 7 p.m. There, they found the 48-year-old victim, who called for help after realizing the sticky situation he was in when he tried -- and failed -- to stand up and leave the superstore's restroom, Donnelly said. It took responders 15 minutes to remove the victim from the stall, but they were unable to disconnect the toilet seat from his body, Donnelly said. Instead, the victim was taken to Union Hospital of Cecil County, where the seat was detached. He left with only minor injuries to his buttocks, Donnelly said. Police do not suspect that the victim was specifically targeted, but that the incident was a random prank, Donnelly said. They have not received reports of glue-laden toilet seats since.","Apparently random victim had to be taken to hospital .

"(CNN) -- Internet giant Google has been stopped from gathering images in Greek cities for its Street View service until it provides further guarantees about privacy. One of Google's Street View camera cars capturing images in central London. Launched in the U.S. two years ago, Street View provides users with access to 3-D ""pedestrian's-eye"" views of urban areas by zooming into the lowest level on its Google Maps and Google Earth applications. It has since been rolled out in more than 100 cities in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, France, Spain, Italy, Britain and the Netherlands. The images are obtained from cars specially-fitted with cameras that drive around towns and cities taking panoramic 360 degree shots of everything from pedestrians in the street, to customers sitting in street cafes. Despite pledging to recognize local privacy laws, Google has come under fire from privacy campaigners who fear the application could be abused by criminals or even snooping government agencies. Do you agree? Share your thoughts below . In April, a group of villagers in a picturesque English village chased away one of the search engine's camera cars as it attempted to photograph their homes.

"A woman in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland who'd fallen ill tested negative for Ebola, the Scottish government said Tuesday. A spokesman for the government said the woman had been in West Africa recently, though she had no direct contact with anyone with Ebola. ""A patient at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary has tested negative for Ebola,"" the press release said. ""The individual was transferred to the hospital by the Scottish Ambulance Service yesterday after falling ill while visiting Torridon in the Scottish Highlands."" Meanwhile, a health care worker who was diagnosed with the Ebola virus after returning to Scotland from Sierra Leone was transferred to the Royal Free Hospital in London. The patient is Pauline Cafferkey, 39, of Glasgow, Scotland, the hospital said. She was working with Save the Children at an Ebola treatment center, said Michael von Bertele, humanitarian director at that organization. She traveled via Casablanca, Morocco, and London Heathrow Airport before arriving at Glasgow Airport on a British Airways flight late Sunday, the health agency NHS Scotland said. After feeling unwell, she sought medical attention and became the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola within the United Kingdom. British media outlets said Cafferkey is a public health nurse in Scotland's South Lanarkshire area who was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to West Africa by the UK government last month in a joint endeavor with Save the Children. She was reportedly transferred to London in a military aircraft fitted with an isolation pod. The Royal Free Hospital is equipped with a high-level isolation unit, with access restricted to specially trained medical staff. A specially designed tent, with controlled ventilation, is set up over the patient's bed. A British volunteer nurse, William Pooley, was successfully treated in the unit after he was brought home from Sierra Leone in August, having been diagnosed with Ebola there. 'Extremely low' risk . UK authorities are working to trace those who have come into contact with Cafferkey. The Scottish government has set up a special number for people to call if they traveled on the same London Heathrow-to-Glasgow flight as Cafferkey. British Airways said it was working closely with health authorities in England and Scotland and would help with any information needed. ""The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority and the risk to people on board that individual flight is extremely low,"" the airline said. Ebola patients become infectious only after they display symptoms, such as fever and vomiting. The deadly virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids. A Downing Street spokesman told CNN that British Prime Minister David Cameron and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had discussed the procedures in place to handle such a case. ""They agreed that both governments would remain in close touch and ensure everything possible was done to support the patient and, although the risk to the general population remained low, all measures would be taken to protect public health."" Possible case . Another suspected Ebola case is being tested in southwest England at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, health officials said. ""We do not expect the results to be known for at least 24 hours and in the meantime the patient is being looked after in isolation, following nationally agreed guidelines and protocols to protect the health of our staff and other patients,"" said a joint statement from the hospital and Public Health England, a government agency. According to UK government guidelines, humanitarian workers returning from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa who've been at high risk of exposure are expected to monitor their own health for 21 days after they get home. As of December 24, at least 7,693 people had died in the current Ebola outbreak, centered in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the World Health Organization said. There have been at least 19,695 cases.","Woman in the Scottish Highlands tests negative for Ebola, government says .

"(CNN) -- With a fourth video released, Gruber-gate is now in full swing. The latest caught-on-tape remarks from economist Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act, has him asserting back in 2010 that the ""American public"" -- that's you and me -- ""doesn't actually care that much about the uninsured."" He thinks he knows us so well. In another video released earlier, he said that to pass new health care legislation, the Obama administration successfully relied on an electorate -- again, you and me -- that didn't really understand it. ""It's a very clever, you know, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter,"" he tells the Honors Colloquium 2012 at the University of Rhode Island. There appears to be a bottomless well of Gruber's greatest hits. In yet another, from a speech at the University of Pennsylvania in 2013, he explains that the very function of the law -- doing what it was designed to do -- was totally unpalatable to voters (that is, if only we'd turned away from our Cheetos bags and NASCAR races long enough to catch it). ""If you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in -- if you made it explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed."" To hammer the point home, he admits that the sales pitch was one big cover-up operation: ""Lack of transparency is a huge advantage. And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever. But basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass."" And in still another video he's caught telling Washington University at St. Louis in 2013 that one important provision of the bill passed ""because the American people are too stupid to understand the difference."" Let's be clear: Gruber didn't say any of this incredibly arrogant, deeply offensive stuff in a soft whisper at a clandestine meeting of liberal donors. He said these things out loud, at lectures, over and over and over again, without even an attempt at discretion. These videos may seem inflammatory on their face. Here's an Obama adviser gleefully insisting that the administration hoodwinked the American people to pass legislation that otherwise very few would have wanted. But underneath all this arrogance and hubris is a surprising amount of willful ignorance about what actually happened to pass Obamacare. It isn't that Gruber thinks we're all rubes. It's that he thinks his team of brilliant economists and political spin-doctors were so clever they actually got away with something. That just isn't the case. For one, it was hardly a secret that the law relied on healthy people to pay in so that sick people would get coverage. Most of us -- even the stupidest -- know that's how insurance works. And just to be sure it was clear, Republicans and opponents of the law reiterated this fact ad nauseam during the public debate of the Affordable Care Act. Heck, even Obamacare supporters were insistent on explaining this point for the express purpose of getting healthy people to sign up for it. The administration spent millions on a marketing pitch to convince young, healthy millennials to invest in health insurance many didn't appear to want. For another, despite Gruber's insistence that the administration maintained a necessary opacity about the law, there were plenty of warnings about its potential fundamental problems, and numerous advocacy groups, impartial economists and media outlets were steadily fact-checking the President's rosy predictions about the law. From them we heard it may not reduce the deficit by $1 trillion. We heard it would not reduce health care costs. We heard it would reduce the workforce by an equivalent of 2 million jobs. We heard premiums would rise. We heard we might not be able to keep our health plans after all. Of course, only time will tell whether those warnings will bear out, but opponents of the legislation were making them back then, even though Gruber believes the administration hid them so well, and were vocal about it. And to pretty clear results. According to Kaiser Family tracking polls of the legislation since 2010, the law has never cracked a 51% favorability rating, and has at times plummeted to the low 30s. Another point: The American people never voted on Obamacare, so I'm not sure what role Gruber thinks the ""stupid"" electorate played in its passage. In fact, in the first election after the Affordable Care Act passed, Republicans who opposed the legislation retook the House of Representatives and kicked 11 Democrats out of state houses. Obamacare wasn't a cleverly concealed mystery package that Democrats slipped under the noses of an otherwise bumbling idiocracy. It was passed by a Democratic majority that controlled both houses, without a single Republican vote, pushed through by a White House that cared more about scoring a political victory than if the law would ever work as intended or if Americans would like it. Gruber's misguided sense of accomplishment reflects not so much elitism as it does the arrogance of liberal ""solutionism,"" or the tendency of technocrats to assume they can solve complex social problems easily. Technology scholar Evgeny Morozov, author of ""To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism,"" writes that ""solutionists err by assuming, rather than investigating, the problems they set out to tackle. [They] do not limit themselves to fixing the problems of individuals; they are as keen to fix the problems of institutions."" This kind of hubris explains why someone like Michael Bloomberg believes he can solve gun crime by banning guns or obesity by banning big sodas. And it's why Jonathan Gruber believed he could solve our health care problems. It's not because he actually wanted to understand the problem, but because he decided what the problem was (in this case, that healthy people were paying too little for insurance) and assumed we were all too dumb to ask any questions. But we asked plenty of questions. We are still asking questions. And legislators, economists and health care scholars will be trying to fix the mess that Gruber et al created for many years to come. But when this legislation finally collapses under its own weight, Gruber will no doubt find a way to blame stupid Americans for failing to properly implement his vision.","S.E.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- A little more than a year after his election, President Obama said his administration has laid the groundwork for success on global and domestic matters. ""I think that we've restored America's standing in the world, and that's confirmed by polls,"" he told CNN's Ed Henry in a wide-ranging interview this week during his trip to China. ""I think a recent one indicated that around the world, before my election, less than half the people -- maybe less than 40 percent of the people -- thought that you could count on America to do to the right thing. Now it's up to 75 percent."" The president said that makes it easier for world leaders to cooperate with the United States, noting Chinese and Russia involvement in nuclear talks with Iran. Obama has visited 20 countries during his first year in office, more than any other U.S. president. A decision on troops levels in Afghanistan is ""very close,"" the president said. ""I will announce that decision certainly in the next several weeks."" Obama has been holding regular meetings with his war council to develop options for sending more troops to Afghanistan. Last week, the president told the group -- comprising top Cabinet, Pentagon and administration officials -- that the U.S. troop commitment to Afghanistan is not open-ended and then asked for revisions to options he previously received, a senior administration official said at the time. The war council is considering a request by the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan for up to 40,000 more troops. ""We have a vital interest in making sure that Afghanistan is sufficiently stable, that it can't infect the entire region with violent extremism,"" Obama said. ""We also have to make sure that we've got an effective partner in Afghanistan. And that's something that we are examining very closely and presenting some very clear benchmarks for the Afghan government."" On the China trip, Obama gave interviews to other networks as well, including Fox News, NBC and CBS. During the talk with CBS, the president said he was angry about multiple leaks over his Afghanistan policy deliberations. He said leaking such information is a firing offense. ""We have deliberations in the situation room for a reason,"" he said. ""We're making life and death decisions that affect how our troops are able to operate in a theater of war. For people to be releasing info in the course of deliberations is not appropriate."" In his interview with Fox, Obama indicated concern that a growing national deficit may contribute to a loss of confidence and eventually a ""double-dip"" recession. He said he is willing to consider targeted tax cuts to help bring down rising unemployment. The president told CNN that he's confidence efforts to overhaul health care will succeed despite missed deadlines along the way. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Tuesday that he was still waiting for a cost estimate of the legislation from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. That estimate won't be completed until at least Wednesday, a senior Democratic source said. Sixty votes in the 100-member Senate are required to overcome a filibuster and open Senate debate on the bill. Democratic leadership sources said a Saturday vote to start debate is likely. It remains unclear, however, whether the Democrats have enough votes. ""There are just a lot of procedural hurdles that explain why health care hasn't been dealt with in 40, 50, 70 years,"" Obama said. ""But I remain confident that we are going to get this done, and we're going to have a bill that reduces our deficit, bends the cost curve, covers millions of people who don't have health insurance right now and, for people who do have health insurance, makes their insurance more secure."" In a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday, 46 percent of respondents said they favored the version of the bill that the House of Representatives recently passed, while 49 percent opposed it. The survey's sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. Asked about running for re-election, Obama didn't say ""yes,"" but he acknowledged the long-term nature of his policy goals. ""I don't want to be making decisions based on getting re-elected, because I think the challenges that America faces right now are so significant,"" the president said. ""Obviously, if I make those decisions and I think that I'm moving the country on the right direction economically, in terms of our security interests, our foreign policy, I'd like to think that those policies are continued, because they're not going to bear fruit just in four years."" Obama said if he were concentrating on re-election, he wouldn't be tackling politically hot topics such as health care and education reform, development of a clean-energy economy and the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba. The U.S. military is holding about 215 men at Guantanamo. Among the detainees are five suspects with alleged ties to the 9/11 conspiracy, including accused mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Attorney General Eric Holder said last week that Mohammed and four others will be tried in a civilian court in New York. ""There are a whole series of choices that I'm making that I know are going to create some political turbulence,"" the president said. ""But I think they're the right thing to do. And, you know, history will ... bear out my theories or not.""","President Obama says improved U.S. image promotes global cooperation .

"Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani, the head of a network of Christian house churches in Iran, could be executed as soon as midnight Wednesday in Tehran for refusing to recant his religious beliefs and convert to Islam, said the chair of a commission that monitors religious freedom around the world. A statement by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent advisory group appointed by the president and Congress, ""expressed deep concern"" for the man's fate. After four days of an appeals trial for apostasy, Nadarkhani refused to recant his beliefs. Leonard Leo, chair of the commission, said the pastor ""is being asked to recant a faith he has always had. Once again, the Iranian regime has demonstrated that it practices hypocritical barbarian practices."" Leo said that while the trial is closed to the press, the commission collects information from sources in Iran and around the world. A release by the group says their responsibility is to ""review the facts and circumstances of violations of religious freedom internationally."" ""I would be disappointed if at the end of this whole maelstrom, there was no statement by our government on this situation,"" Leo said. ""At some point the United States has to stand up for the right of this pastor and for human rights more broadly and call countries to account for what they are doing."" The commission's statement also called the trial a sham and said Iran is violating the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a party. Nadarkhani was first sentenced to execution in November 2010, the commission said, and in order to avoid the death penalty, he is being asked to recant his beliefs and convert to Islam. Leo said an apostasy trial is rare in Iran; the last occurred in 1990. Iran's claim stems from the pastor's Muslim parents. According to Leo, the court needed to verify if Nadarkhani had ever been a Muslim. In order to be given what Iran looks at as the opportunity to recant his beliefs, Nadarkhani must have never been a Muslim before the age of 15, Leo said. Because for the last four days in court he was given the opportunity, it is apparent that the Iranian court found he was never a Muslim and therefore Nadarkhani could have converted. According to a source close to the situation within the Commission on International Religious Freedom, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, would have to sign off on the execution. Speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the subject's sensitivity, the source said these types of issues are always difficult with Iran because of the lack of transparency in how they make decisions on when and how to act. The source also said that in the past, political prisoners have had their prison time and punishment reduced by the Iranian government. Though they did not say that was guaranteed in this situation, the source indicated it was a possibility. The American Center for Law and Justice, a right-leaning organization founded by television evangelist Pat Robertson, reported Wednesday night that Nadarkhani's death sentence punishment had been overturned, meaning that the pastor would be receiving a lower punishment than death. They sourced the claim to someone in Iran. Those reports could not be verified by CNN. The Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the United Nations failed to comment on the ruling. Jordan Sekulow, executive director of the ACLJ, said the outcry from Christians in America has been loud and sustained. ""American Christian, like never before, are engaged in this,"" Sekulow said. ""This is evidence that Christians in America over the past decade have done a better job engaging in the persecution issue."" Sekulow also said he hopes the White House or State Department will issue a statement on the issue.","Source says Iran's supreme leader would have to sign off on execution .

"Patti Davis, Ronald Reagan's daughter, recently speculated on where her father might stand on same-sex marriage. Politico published her thoughts under the headline, ""Patti Davis says Reagan wouldn't have opposed gay marriage."" The impact of the article was immediate. A quick Google search yielded multiple follow-up articles and blog posts. Liberals nationwide were off and running with a new same-sex marriage endorsement: this one from Reagan, the conservative's conservative. This is not the first time liberals have rushed to recast Reagan according to their policy preferences. Immediately after his death in June 2004, he was trotted out as a poster-boy for embryonic stem-cell research. Please, not so fast. In Davis' defense, she starts with a crucial point about her father, one  liberals had utterly refused while the man was alive: ""He was a very tolerant person."" Indeed, Reagan was tolerant -- on religion, on race, on ethnic differences, on differences of opinion on many things, and also toward gays. As Davis notes, ""He did not have prejudices against gay people."" Davis gives just a few of many examples. But she then goes where I don't think we should. She states of her father and same-sex marriage: ""I don't think he would stand in the way of it, at all. I don't think he would stand in the way of two people wanting to make a commitment to one another."" French lawmakers approve same-sex marriage bill . Davis then uses an argument that is libertarian (which Reagan was not), and which fails to understand the essence of conservatives' objection to same-sex marriage: ""I also think because he wanted government out of peoples' lives, he would not understand the intrusion of government banning such a thing. This is not what he would have thought government should be doing."" The problem with that statement, applied to the same-sex marriage debate, is this: Conservatives object to the federal government rendering unto itself the unprecedented ability to redefine marriage. Such is a massive step toward government intervention (one that should worry libertarians), toward powerful government, toward big government -- not restrained and limited government. It is a step that breaks entirely new ground in not only American history but human history, one with unimaginable and extraordinary effects yet to come on the family, the culture, the economy, government services and (among others) the court system. The essence of conservatism is to preserve and conserve time-tested values that have endured for good reason and for the best of society and for order. Conservatives -- which is what Reagan was -- aim to conserve. By their nature and definition, conservatives do not rush into radical changes or what they fear may be another fad or fashion or popular demand. They also, by their definition, ground their ideals in both natural law and biblical law. I know that secular liberals don't want to hear religious arguments against same-sex marriage, but, if we're talking about Reagan (and conservatives), we cannot exclude them. Sutter: Same-sex marriage hasn't won (yet ...) Contrary to the image of him as president, Reagan was very religious and would not have so easily consented to a culture suddenly demanding the right to redefine what the scriptures (Old Testament and New Testament) say clearly about a man and a woman leaving their parents and coming together to form one flesh in marriage. Reagan's religious roots were deep, inculcated by his mother, an extremely devout, traditional Christian, and others who profoundly influenced him in Dixon, Illinois, in the 1920s. He said that ""everything"" he learned about the values that shaped his life and presidency he learned back in Dixon. It was his ""inheritance,"" one that never left him. Needless to say, Reagan did not learn to support same-sex marriage in Dixon. Moreover, Reagan was unwavering in his conviction of the importance of a father and a mother raising children and the next generation of American citizens and understood marriage as a vital bond between a man and a woman. To cite just one example from the final days of his presidency (January 12, 1989), Reagan insisted that ""we must teach youngsters the beauty of the loving, lifelong relationship between husband and wife that is marriage."" Yes, Reagan was tolerant of gay people -- as is everyone I know who opposes same-sex marriage -- but that in no way means he would have advocated redefining marriage. Toleration of something certainly does not automatically translate into advocating its legalization. We could list innumerable things that we tolerate -- including from friends and family and loved ones -- but wouldn't argue legalizing. Even then, that's not quite the issue. The issue, after all, isn't whether homosexuality should be legal (no one objects to that) but whether marriage will now begin a long process of continual redefinition. It's a form of intellectual laziness for liberals/progressives to reflexively assume that anyone who disagrees with them on redefining marriage is a recalcitrant bigot with no possible legitimate reasons. After all, same-sex marriage opponents are adhering to the prevailing definition of marriage according to its literal and ancient roots; they believe in the cross-cultural norm that humanity has adhered to since the dawn of humanity, to a human understanding as old as the Garden of Eden. It's remarkably short-sighted to dismiss them as hopeless bigots. That brings me back to Ronald Reagan. It's funny, people on the political left spent eight years calling Reagan a bigot. When liberals weren't denouncing him as an unregenerate racist -- the single most unfair charge unceasingly flung at Reagan -- they were saying that he didn't like gay people and did nothing about AIDS because he was happy to let gays die. Davis remembers this well, as she does the vicious accusation that her father was a nuclear warmonger. To say that liberals were unhinged in their nastiness to Reagan is insufficient. Now, in his death, they'd like to remold him in their own image, crowning him a poster boy for same-sex marriage. The simple truth is that Reagan was a committed and principled conservative who had thoughtful and firmly grounded reasons for his positions. That, too, ironically, is a fact that liberals ignored, caricaturing Reagan as an idiot, a simpleton, an ""amiable dunce,"" as Clark Clifford famously called him. He would not have merrily hopped on the same-sex marriage bandwagon without first carefully considering how the issue fit with his understanding of the laws of nature and nature's God, of the first things and first principles that conservatives of Reagan's generation spent years discussing at great length in their books and publications and conferences. Could we at least agree on this much? Reagan was silent on same-sex marriage, as was everyone of his generation. He, like all liberals of his time, could not have conceived of same-sex marriage, and he, like the entirety of the Democratic Party just a decade or two ago, unwaveringly supported traditional marriage. Let's leave it at that.","Paul Kengor: Patti Davis says her father would have backed same-sex marriage .

"(CNN) -- The outrage came hard and fast after a 3-year-old girl badly scarred and wearing an eye patch because of a pit bull attack was apparently asked to leave a KFC restaurant because her appearance upset other customers. After social media users opened fire on the restaurant, calling for a boycott, the apology from the chain came quickly too. The company said it will donate $30,000 to assist with the girl's medical bills. ""The entire KFC family is behind Victoria,"" company spokesman Rick Maynard said. 'Her face is disrupting our customers' Victoria Wilcher was mauled by three pit bulls a few months ago, causing her to need regular medical treatment. After a doctor's visit last week, grandmother Kelly Mullins took the child to a KFC in Jackson, Mississippi. ""I ordered a large sweet tea and her some mashed potatoes and gravy because she was hungry,"" Mullins told CNN affiliate WAPT. ""She was on a feeding tube at the time, but I figured she could just swallow (the potatoes). They just told us, they said, 'We have to ask you to leave because her face is disrupting our customers.' (Victoria) understood exactly what they said."" Victoria cried all the way home, Mullins said. ""She's got a lot of surgeries to go through and she won't even look in the mirror anymore,"" Mullins told WAPT. ""When we go to a store, she doesn't even want to get out (of the car). She's 3 years old and she's embarrassed about what she looks like. She's embarrassed and I hate it because she shouldn't be. It ain't her fault."" Anger online . Victoria's family recounted the incident in a Facebook page set up to raise money for her medical expenses. ""Does this face look scary to you?"" the family posted on the Victoria's Victories Facebook page. ""I personally will never step foot in another KFC again and will be personally writing the CEO."" The anger spread. ""As soon as we were notified of this report Friday, we immediately began an investigation, as this kind of hurtful and disrespectful action would not be tolerated by KFC,"" the company said. ""Regardless of the outcome of our investigation, we have apologized to Victoria's family and are committed to assisting them."" A horrible attack . Authorities said Victoria was attacked in April while visiting her grandfather, from whom Kelly Mullins is divorced. One of the dogs ripped open the front door and two other dogs dragged her into the backyard, WAPT reported. The dogs bit the girl all over, but especially on the face. She has severe facial scars and lost sight in her right eye and the ability to move the right side of her face, Mullins told WAPT. She wears an eye patch with a cartoon character on it. The three dogs that attacked Victoria were killed. The grandfather, Donald Mullins, and his girlfriend were arrested on child endangerment charges, WAPT reported. Meanwhile, the Facebook page got lots of attention, with almost 49,000 ""likes"" by early Monday morning.","Victoria Wilcher was attacked by three pit bulls in April .

"(CNN)The world's strangest looking airplane is celebrating the 20th anniversary of its first flight this month. Popularly known as the ""Beluga,"" because of its resemblance to the white Arctic whale, the Airbus A300-600ST (ST stands for Super Transporter) is unique not only in appearance, but also for the essential role it performs in European aviation. Today, more than 60 flights are performed each week between 11 sites, carrying parts for all of the Airbus programs. So what's so special about this odd-looking aircraft? Here's an in-depth look at the A300-600ST. From guppies to belugas . Airbus' production centers are scattered all over the continent, a legacy of its origins as a pan-European consortium. Each factory specializes in the completion of a specific section of an aircraft. The five Belugas, all operated by Airbus, link these plants and take the different aircraft sections to the final assembly line, either in Toulouse or Hamburg. Until the mid-1990s, Airbus used another funny-looking aircraft to perform its big transporting jobs -- the ""Super Guppy,"" a derivative of the Boeing C-97, a military cargo version of the 1940s Boeing 377 Stratocruiser. The Super Guppy was already outdated by the time Airbus started using it. Worse was the fact that Airbus was relying on a couple of old aircraft from its chief rival, Boeing, to handle the bulk of its logistics chain. If it was to keep up with its frantic growth, Airbus concluded it needed something better. The airframe chosen for the job was taken from the Airbus A300-600, an aircraft that already had a successful track record with airlines such as Lufthansa, Air France and American Airlines. Each of the five Belugas in operation are, actually, Airbus A300-600 jets that have been modified to carry large cargo. The top section of the aircraft was cut and an additional, wider fuselage section -- resembling a bubble -- was added to the airframe, giving it its characteristic hump. The cockpit was lowered, making it possible for the cargo hold to be loaded and unloaded through the front of the aircraft. The result is an incredibly spacious cargo hold. Although the Beluga's maximum payload of 47 tons is surpassed by a handful of other cargo aircraft, its voluminous hold makes it suitable for transporting oversized, but not particularly heavy, cargo. Like aircraft parts. The Beluga can carry the wings of an A340 airliner or a fuselage section for Airbus' newest wide-body aircraft, the A350. But it's not large enough to transport many A380 super jumbo parts. Those need to travel by boat, barge and road. Belugas have occasionally been chartered to fly satellites, helicopters and even works of art. Delacroix's ""Liberty Leading the People"" flew from Paris to Tokyo on a Beluga -- the canvas wouldn't fit into any other plane. Coming up: Beluga XL . With the Beluga hitting two decades of indefatigable service, it's starting to show its age and limitations. Since the Beluga's maiden flight on September 13, 1994, Airbus has multiplied aircraft deliveries by nearly five. The company has become more global, diversifying its supplier base and opening assembly plants in China and Alabama -- well outside the Beluga's relatively short range of 1,500 nautical miles with maximum payload. In order to cope with the increasing workload, Airbus has put in place the so-called ""Fly 10,000"" program. The program aims to optimize the company's logistics infrastructure by increasing the work performed by its transport fleet to 10,000 hours per year by 2017. The plan includes the Beluga. Airbus says the Beluga's flight hours per aircraft have doubled since it first went into service and will do so again by 2017, from 5,000 to 10,000 flight hours, due to the production start of the A350 XWB in 2012 and the production ramp-up on other Airbus programs. With aircraft order books at a historic maximum, however, Airbus can't afford to bet its vital logistics operation chain on the readiness of five aging aircraft. Though no decisions have been made, Airbus is reportedly looking at potential replacement solutions. Tentatively called Beluga XL, the Beluga's replacement is likely to be based on the A330 airframe. It's expected to have a longer range and be able to carry a heavier payload, while still being able to land at airports with relatively short runways, such as the one in Broughton, Wales, where Airbus makes wings for its airliners. The next generation Beluga should also make it possible for Airbus to double its number of cargo flights to 120 per week. What seems assured is that the Beluga XL is going to look similar to the current version, something plane spotters passing through Toulouse should appreciate.

"Video showing Casey Anthony rocking and hunched over upon hearing remains had been found in the search for her 2-year-old daughter was released Friday, after a Florida judge overturned a decision to seal the footage because it was considered inflammatory. The security video -- which has no audio and was taken in a ""waiting area of the medical facility"" at a county jail -- was taken in December 2008 after remains were discovered in woods near her grandparent's Orlando home. By that point, the girl hadn't been seen in public for six months and investigators had spent five months looking for her. Just over a week later, on December 19, 2008, authorities determined the remains were those of young Caylee. In the footage, Casey Anthony is seen rocking back and forth in a chair. After a few minutes, law enforcement officers talk to Anthony and take her to another room. Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. issued his ruling on Friday afternoon, two days after a hearing in response to Orlando TV station WKMG's July motion to unseal the footage. In his decision, Perry recalled how then Judge Stan Strickland had sealed the video in May 2009, saying that while he was ""loathe to shield any public record"" he believed that it was inflammatory. Anthony's defense team, in a motion filed in 2009, cited testimony from two Orange County Sheriff's Office employees stating they felt it was ""cruel"" that the then-suspect was ""distressed"" in the waiting room for 30 to 45 minutes on the day news broke that the remains were found. The television was on in the room, broadcasting news about the discovery, according to court testimony. At the time, Anthony was awaiting trial on murder charges and others related to the death of her young daughter. A jury acquitted her on that and other charges in July, though she was convicted on four lesser charges related to misleading authorities in the case. ""The reason for sealing (the video) -- Ms. Anthony's right to a fair trial -- is no longer applicable because the trial has been completed and she has been acquitted of all charges other than lying to law enforcement officers,"" wrote Perry, before ordering the state attorney's office to release the video. During Wednesday's hearing, defense attorney Jose Baez argued that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act prevented the tape from being released in public because Casey received medical attention while she was in the waiting room. The news station argued that regulations pertain to medical data and not treatment, and insisted that the tape is part of the public record. In his ruling, Perry found that ""the jail video does not constitute a medical record or other form of health care data relating to the evaluation or treatment of Ms. Anthony's physical or mental health condition."" The judge also added that ""there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in jail."" The ruling is the latest setback for Anthony and her defense team. Last week, Perry ordered her to pay $217,000 to authorities for costs related to investigating Caylee's disappearance. Officials had argued that if it were not for the 25-year-old Orlando woman's lies, investigators would not have had to spend the time and money to find her daughter's body. Anthony's attorneys have claimed that Caylee died accidentally when she drowned in the family's' pool.","NEW:  Anthony was in jail room where TV carried news remains had been found .

"A decreasing number of American gun owners own two-thirds of the nation's guns and as many as one-third of the guns on the planet -- even though they account for less than 1% of the world's population, according to a CNN analysis of gun ownership data. The data, collected by the Injury Prevention Journal, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the General Social Survey and population figures from the U.S. Census Bureau, found that the number of U.S. households with guns has declined, but current gun owners are gathering more guns. The United States tends to have better data on gun numbers than other countries, for instance Somalia or the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which may account for the high percentage, according to Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the School of Criminal Justice at The University at Albany. Gun owners debate in wake of Aurora tragedy . However, within its own borders, the U.S. gun owning population is on the decline and those gun owners are stockpiling more firearms. ""Those who own guns, own more guns,"" said Josh Sugarmann, the executive director and founder of the Violence Policy Center, a Washington-based gun control advocacy group.  Last year the organization released an analysis of figures from the General Social Survey, which found that both the number of households owning guns and the number of people owning guns were decreasing. Politicians from both parties have tip-toed around gun control after the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater massacre to avoid political implications in the upcoming election. However, studies suggest they are bowing to a smaller number of American gun owners. Those gun owners tend to live in swing states, explained Lizotte. ""You can see where [the gun debate plays out] in the presidential election,"" said Lizotte. ""Where rural states are swing states and urban states are not."" Candidates show little appetite for new gun control laws . A study published in the Injury Prevention Journal, based on a 2004 National Firearms Survey, found that 20% of the gun owners with the most firearms possessed about 65% of the nation's guns. A 2007 survey by the U.N's Office on Drugs and Crime found that the United States, which has 5% of the world's population, owns 50% of the world's guns. The number of households owning guns has declined from almost 50% in 1973 to just over 32% in 2010, according to a 2011 study produced by The University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center. The number of gun owners has gone down almost 10% over the same period, the report found . The concentration comes, in part, because guns are ""marketed by and large to people who already own guns,"" Lizotte said. He also said that guns are specialty items, like tools in a tool box, so those who own guns are more likely to buy additional guns for different hunting purposes, for instance. ""If you use a 12-gauge shotgun to shoot a rabbit, the rabbit won't exist after you shoot it,"" Lizotte said. Therefore a gun owner who is a hunter will use a different gun for different types of hunting, for instance a small-caliber rifle instead of a high-powered shotgun. Both studies also found that men were more likely to own guns, though the General Social Survey found that male gun ownership is down almost 20% since 1980.  The Violence Policy Center's analysis of the General Social Survey data also found that part of the reason the gun owning population is declining is because those weapons are largely owned by white males, a group whose population is aging. One in 10 women own a gun, the General Social Survey found. Opinion: Do guns make us safer? Still, while it is possible to collect accurate data on the number of guns in the United States using manufacturing, import-export and life-cycle data for the guns, the federal government has little idea of who the guns owners are, gun policy experts said. ""The federal government doesn't have good data on anything on guns and that's been done on purpose,"" said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center and senior author of the Injury Prevention Journal study. ""The gun lobby has lots of power ... [their] goal is not to have any sort of registration system."" ""We asked, 'Where'd the guns go?' The answer -- it looked like the people that had lots of guns were buying more guns,"" Hemenway said. The false perception that there are more gun owners has helped bolster a political narrative, emboldened the National Rifle Association and left politicians worried about losing support, gun policy experts say. ""...It gives them more power to say they are representing more gun owners and there are more gun owners,"" said Hemenway. Sugarmann agreed. ""There is a myth pushed by the gun industry, the NRA and the trade associations for gun makers that gun ownership is up,"" he said.  ""[That] there are more gun owners, when the opposite is true, gun ownership is declining."" The NRA did not respond to repeated requests from CNN for comment.

"Texas Gov. Rick Perry is demanding an apology from a California newspaper that published a cartoon that seemed to link his push for less regulations to the recent fertilizer plant explosion that killed 14. ""The Sacramento Bee published a disgusting 'cartoon' mocking the deadly explosion in West. While I will always welcome healthy policy debate, I won't stand for someone mocking the tragic deaths of my fellow Texans and our fellow Americans. I have written the editor and asked that they apologize to the citizens of West,"" Perry wrote on his official Facebook page. An editor at the paper defended the cartoon. ""Jack Ohman's cartoon of April 25 made a strong statement about Gov. Rick Perry's disregard for worker safety, and his attempts to market Texas as a place where industries can thrive with few regulations,"" said Stuart Leavenworth, the paper's editorial page editor.  ""It is unfortunate that Gov. Perry, and some on the blogosphere, have attempted to interpret the cartoon as being disrespectful of the victims of this tragedy."" Editorial Cartoonist Jack Ohman also responded to some reader criticism of his cartoon in a column Thursday. Ohman said he stood by the cartoon and listed many reasons he believes Perry's policies deserve scrutiny. ""The Texas governor's campaigning notwithstanding, should I have used the explosion as a vehicle to illustrate my point? I did. I stand by it,"" Ohman wrote. The cartoon, published Thursday, shows Perry standing at a podium in front of signs about lower taxes and lower regulations proclaiming ""Business is booming in Texas."" The next frame of the cartoon shows a huge explosion alluding to the April 17 fertilizer plant tragedy in West, Texas, that killed 14 people, injured up to 200 and destroyed more than 100 homes. Days after the cartoon was published, it was still drawing mostly negative responses on the Sacramento Bee website. The explosion created a crater nearly 100 feet wide and 10 feet deep, and devastated the small town. Officials are still trying to determine what caused the fire that lead to the explosion. Perry said he was offended the cartoon was published Thursday, the same day the governor, President Barack Obama and many others gathered for a memorial for the victims. ""Publishing this on the very day our state and nation paused to honor and mourn those who died only compounds the pain and suffering of the many Texans,"" Perry wrote.","""I won't stand for someone mocking the tragic deaths,"" Perry says .

"(CNN) -- A Malaysia Airlines passenger jet crashed in a rebel-controlled part of eastern Ukraine on Thursday, spurring swift accusations from Ukrainian officials that ""terrorists"" shot down the aircraft. The United States has concluded a missile shot down the plane, but hasn't pinpointed who was responsible, a senior U.S. official told CNN's Barbara Starr. The Boeing 777 with 298 people aboard fell from the sky near the town of Torez in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, officials said. A top Ukrainian official said the plane, which was on the way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was flying at about 10,000 meters (nearly 33,000 feet) when the missile hit. A radar system saw a surface-to-air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before the plane went down, the senior U.S. official said. A second system saw a heat signature at the time the airliner was hit, the official said. The United States is analyzing the trajectory of the missile to try to learn where the attack came from, the official said. The Obama administration believes Ukraine did not have the capability in the region -- let alone the motivation -- to shoot down the plane, a U.S. official told CNN's Jake Tapper. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said the plane never made a distress call. He called for an international team to have full access to the crash site. ""We must and we will find out precisely what happened to this flight. No stone will be left unturned,"" he said. ""If it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice,"" Najib said. Ukrainian officials maintained that pro-Russian separatists were behind the crash. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Ukraine's military campaign against the separatists was to blame. ""This tragedy would not have happened, if there had been peace on that land, or in any case, if military operations in southeastern Ukraine had not been renewed,"" Putin said in televised remarks. ""And without a doubt the government of the territory on which it happened bears responsibility for this frightening tragedy."" Ukraine's state security chief accused two Russian military intelligence officers of involvement and said they must be punished. Valentyn Nalyvaichenko said he based his allegation on intercepts of phone conversations between the two officers. ""Now you know who carried out this crime. We will do everything for the Russian military who carried out this crime to be punished,"" he told reporters. The jet plunged toward the ground in a fireball, leaving a trail of black smoke behind in the sky. Emergency crews scrambled to what witnesses described as a staggering scene of death and utter destruction. ""People said the plane kind of exploded in the air, and that everything rained down in bits and pieces, the plane itself, the people inside,"" said Noah Sneider, an American freelance journalist who interviewed witnesses at the scene. Charred wreckage stretched for kilometers, he said. Stunned rescue workers and rebel fighters combed the area, Sneider said, planting sticks with white cotton ribbons where they found bodies in the fields. ""As you walk through the fields, you see a man with his cracked iPhone sticking out of his pocket. You see sort of people's clothing everywhere. Most of it's kind of ripped off by the air. There's some suitcases and stuff in a pile by the road,"" Sneider said. There were many bodies left to be found as night fell, he said, and people were trying to figure out what to do next. Locals in the rural area trying to help were overwhelmed, he said. Firemen who rushed to put out the flames found they had a hose with holes in it, spraying water everywhere, he said. ""One man said to me, 'Nothing's happened in this village for 30 years, and now this,'"" Sneider said. As details emerge, accusations fly . Details -- and accusations -- quickly poured in about Thursday's crash, which came the same week that Ukrainian officials said a Russian fighter shot down a Ukrainian military transport plane while the aircraft was in Ukrainian airspace. Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, said in a Facebook post that ""terrorists"" fired on the plane operating a Buk surface-to-air missile system. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko described the crash as a ""terrorist action."" ""We do not exclude that the plane was shot down and confirm that the Ukraine Armed Forces did not fire at any targets in the sky,"" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said, according to his website. CNN's Richard Quest, an aviation expert, said that it would be ""extremely unusual"" for an airliner at nearly 33,000 feet to be shot down. From the ground, one could simply look up and tell whether a plane was a commercial aircraft, he said. ""So something is absolutely appalling that's gone on here."" U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said that Ukraine's president had accepted an offer of U.S. experts to help investigate the crash. ""They will be on their way rapidly to see if we can get to the bottom of this,"" he said. Biden said the plane was apparently shot down, adding ""not an accident, blown out of the sky."" Who was on the plane? The 15 crew members on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 were all Malaysian nationals, officials said. Malaysia Airlines also gave a breakdown of the known nationalities of the 283 passengers: 154 were Dutch, 27 were Australians, 28 were Malaysians, 12 were Indonesian, nine were from the United Kingdom, four were from Germany; four were from Belgium, three were from the Philippines and one was Canadian. Authorities were still trying to determine the nationalities of the other passengers. The International AIDS Society said in a statement that ""a number of colleagues and friends"" were on the plane, on the way to attend the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia. ""At this incredibly sad and sensitive time the IAS stands with our international family and sends condolences to the loved ones of those who have been lost to this tragedy,"" the statement said. Russia-Ukraine dispute . The route the Malaysian plane was on, between Kuala Lumpur and the Netherlands, is a common one, CNN aviation safety consultant Mary Schiavo said Thursday. She said that the plane was flying over a troubled area and that close communication with air traffic controllers would be a key necessity. Torez is in a rebel-held area. In hostile or disputed areas, ""any alteration from your course, and you can have a problem,"" Schiavo said. Tensions have been high between Ukraine and Russia since street protests forced former pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych from power in February. Russia subsequently annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region, and a pro-Russian separatist rebellion has been raging in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Ukrainian forces have been struggling to quell the separatist unrest. Ukraine's government has accused Russia of allowing weapons and military equipment, including tanks, to cross the border illegally into the hands of pro-Russian separatists. The Pentagon said Wednesday that Russia now has 12,000 troops on the border with Ukraine, as well as some heavy weapons. The troop numbers had fallen to about 1,000 previously from a high of an estimated 40,000 forces earlier this year. On Thursday, CNN reported that Ukrainian officials said a Russian fighter shot down a Ukrainian jet Wednesday as the jet flew in Ukrainian airspace. Tensions are high over that incident, separate from the breaking news of the Malaysian flight Thursday. Three months ago, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. airlines from flying in areas not far from where Flight 17 reportedly crashed Thursday. ""Due to the potential for conflicting air traffic control instructions from Ukrainian and Russian authorities and for the related potential misidentification of civil aircraft, United States flight operations are prohibited until further notice in the airspace over Crimea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov,"" the FAA said in April. Thursday's plane crash reportedly was in eastern Ukraine, scores of miles north-northeast of the Sea of Azov. On Thursday, French transportation official Frederic Cuvillier ordered that French airlines avoid Ukrainian airspace until the cause of Thursday's Malaysia Airlines crash is known, the French Transportation Ministry said in a news release. Airline's troubles . Thursday's crash marks the second time this year that Malaysia Airlines has faced an incident involving a downed plane. On March 8, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared. That Boeing 777 had 239 people on board. Searchers have found no trace of 370 or its passengers, despite extensive search efforts. Flight 370 probably flew into the southern Indian Ocean on autopilot with an unresponsive crew, Australian authorities said last month. During the early phase of the search for Flight 370, aircraft and ships scoured vast stretches of the surface of the southern Indian Ocean but found no debris. Pings initially thought to be from the missing plane's flight recorders led to a concentrated underwater search that turned up nothing. A new underwater search, farther south, will be broadly in an area where planes and vessels had already looked for debris on the surface of the water. It is expected to begin in August. The first Boeing 777 entered service in June 1995, and the airplane has flown almost five million flights, accumulating more than 18 million flight hours, according to Boeing's web site. The plane is capable to flying up to 43,100 feet. What next? Aviation experts cautioned against jumping to conclusions about Thursday's crash at this early stage. But all agreed that a massive investigation should be launched, involving parties not involved in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, . The families of people on board will demand a transparent international investigation, and so will the global community, Quest said. In the coming days, finding and examining the plane's data recorders will be key -- but the fact that the crash occurred in such a volatile region makes what comes next anything but certain, CNN aviation analyst and pilot Miles O'Brien said. ""The big question will be, in whose hands will they fall, and will this be a really objective, international investigation?"" he said. The wreckage path, O'Brien said, will reveal a lot. If a plane breaks up in midair, which is likely what would happen in a missile strike, there would be a large swath of wreckage, he said, but if it breaks down due to mechanical failure, the debris field would be more concentrated.

"Ten years ago I was one of a small number of UK lawyers who opposed the invasion of Iraq on the grounds that it was illegal and unauthorised by the United Nations. We were all strong advocates of the notion that the rule of law was the bedrock of any civilised and democratic society. Without it our lives would be subject to a free for all in which might becomes right. The embodiment of the rule of law internationally has been the U.N. Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- direct results of the devastation inflicted by the Nazi regime in Germany during the Second World War. No one wanted a repeat of such flagrant aggression, so the Charter was drawn up to replace gunboat diplomacy with peaceful measures overseen by the U.N. Security Council. This was not a new vision. In 1945 the U.N. Charter was ratified by the U.S., the UK, and the majority of the 50 states who had originally agreed to this framework. Thrashed out by experts and with massive support behind it, the document was no maverick, outlandish or oddball agreement. The Charter is not gobbledygook -- it is full of common sense, and it should be obligatory reading in every school. OPINION: Why Iraq War was fought for oil . Article 1 makes clear that the main purpose of the U.N. is to ""maintain international peace and security and to that end to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace"" and to act in accordance with justice and the principles of international law. It is for the U.N. to determine what collective measures should be taken -- not for individual states to take unilateral or bilateral action. This is not rocket science, but the simple application of restraint and respect for the rules that Britain and America agreed to when they signed the Charter. But this is not what happened 10 years ago at the behest of U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Their agenda was quite different -- to remove a dictator, Saddam Hussein, whose regime was abhorrent. But regime change, however desirable, is not permitted by the Charter. If it were, the powerful nations could go round the world picking off the weak -- or more particularly the states thought to be hostile to their own ambitions. In case some politicians found it difficult to understand all this, Article 2(4) spelled it out in unequivocal terms: ""All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state"". Everyone recognised there might have to be exceptions to this rule, but the Charter specifically does not authorize preemptive nor preventative action(i.e. getting in first) on the basis of a perceived future threat. INTERACTIVE: How has the war changed you? The only way around this predicament was for the Bush-Blair axis to fabricate a case of threat. This they did by the knowing manipulation of flawed intelligence about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (which were never found), and the bogus claim that Saddam Hussein could deploy such WMD within a 45-minute window. This argument, which was false, became the main basis for invasion because the only other route to war had been closed off by international law. The U.N. has the power to authorise military intervention once all other options have been exhausted and the peace and stability of a region is in jeopardy. At the time it became a debate about whether Iraq satisfied these criteria by its failure to abide by U.N. resolutions concerning disarmament. The principal Security Council resolution 1441, adopted in November 2002, called on Iraq to disarm its WMD and cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. The Council made clear they continued to be in charge but had not authorised the use of force in Iraq. EXCLUSIVE: Hans Blix on 'terrible mistake' in Iraq . Tony Blair insisted to the British public that he would only support a war if a second Security Council resolution authorising the action was passed, but the resolution never came. Bush and Blair realised they would never get one, and so they prepared to go it alone with a cobbled together coalition. Troops had already been committed on the ground. There was no going back. This was why Bush and Blair were not prepared to allow the weapons inspectors, who were in Iraq, any more time. Inspectors had found no evidence of WMD in the lead-up to the war and never did, but were ordered to go home. I am not alone in these views. There is a substantial consensus of international legal opinion which recognises the illegality of the invasion. Kofi Annan, then the U.N. Secretary General, told the BBC in 2004 that the Charter had been breached and that the invasion was not sanctioned by the Security Council. FULL COVERAGE: The Iraq War, 10 years on . In the UK we are still waiting for the results of a public inquiry into the circumstances in which the decision to go to war was taken. Blair never wanted this inquiry but was forced by the power of the victims' families and public opinion to accede. So far two years have gone by while the government has obstructed disclosure and publication. It is intolerable and inexcusable. I believe George W. Bush and Tony Blair should be tried for war crimes as defined by international law. In 1998 the International Criminal Court was established to deal with individuals who commit international crimes. Four transgressions were agreed -- war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression. Unfortunately only the first three have been brought into effect. The UK, to their credit, signed up to the court. But the U.S. did not, lest its leaders end up accused of crimes before the court. ARWA DAMON: Iraq suffocates in cloak of sorrow . Whilst the act of aggression cannot be prosecuted, war crimes committed thereafter can be. So for example to launch an attack, like the invasion of Iraq, with the knowledge that its effect is likely to cause incidental death or injury to civilians or the natural environment (Article 8) will render the perpetrator liable to prosecution. The use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium in Iraq by coalition forces (euphemistically called collateral damage) upon vulnerable civilians falls within this definition. As a result, a legal consortium of which I was a part, and other groups in Europe, petitioned the ICC for action against UK politicians over their involvement in the war. Nothing has happened. Getting U.S leaders hauled before the court is even more problematic -- the Security Council could refer Americans to the court, but the U.S. is a permanent Council member and can veto any potential referral. Alternatively individual member states could incorporate these crimes of universal jurisdiction into their own domestic law. Then if a U.S. perpetrator of war crimes travelled into that country's jurisdiction, they could be arrested. The UK has such a provision, but when put to the test by UK citizens seeking arrest warrants in relation to the planned visits of Israeli political and military leaders -- who were potentially responsible for war crimes in Gaza -- the UK government reprehensibly placed impediments in the way of its future use. So George W. Bush can safely plan a visit for tea with Tony Blair in London without fear of prosecution in the UK. The whole episode regarding the Iraq War is a tawdry tale that has subverted the rule of law and tarnished the reputation of international law. Without accountability for Western states, how can we expect the rest of world to respect these principles? It is time for Bush and Blair to be thoroughly, independently and judicially investigated for the crimes I suggest have been committed and it is time for the crime of aggression to come into force. Until this is redressed, la lotta continua!","Mansfield: Bush, Blair should be tried for war crimes over invasion of Iraq .
Mansfied: Regime change is not permitted by the U.N. Charter .
Mansfield: Charter does not authorize preemptive action based on perceived threat ."
"The demonstrators have no clear leader. Many say Twitter posts and Facebook groups brought them to the streets of Mexico's capital and cities around the country. With presidential elections less than six weeks away, they are protesting media coverage of the campaign and criticizing the candidate widely seen as the front-runner. Local media reports have described it as ""the Mexican Spring,"" drawing a comparison with massive protests pushing for political change in the Middle East. The surge of student activism has drawn attention at a key time during campaigning in the politically polarized country, where security concerns and economic problems have been top issues for candidates vying for the presidency. ""It was about time that Mexico woke up, that it stopped watching television,"" said Leonardo Mata, a student at Mexico City's Metropolitan Autonomous University who joined thousands marching in the capital on Wednesday. TV coverage of the campaign has drawn sharp criticism from some protesters, who argue that national broadcaster Televisa has provided more favorable coverage to Enrique Pena Nieto, the Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate who leads in polls. Televisa's president appeared to acknowledge the protests in a Twitter post this week. ""At Televisa we value the youth and we listen to their opinions. We are always open to them,"" Grupo Televisa CEO Emilio Azcarraga Jean wrote. Mexican Interior Minister Alejandro Poire alluded to the protests Thursday. ""I am convinced that having youth that are enthusiastic, proactive, participatory youth that are demanding of us is without a doubt, a fundamental activity of our democracy, and it is there, and today it is being expressed with great vigor,"" he said. Leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador praised the protesters. ""They are touching on a fundamental theme that has to do with the pretension of dominating the country through the almost absolute control of the media,"" said Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor who frequently criticizes the country's political establishment. He never conceded after officials declared Felipe Calderon the winner of Mexico's election in 2006 and has been known to refer to himself as ""the legitimate president of Mexico."" Lopez Obrador and other opponents have accused Pena Nieto of receiving preferential treatment from the media since before the campaign began. The candidate, who was governor of the state of Mexico from 2005 to 2011, has denied those accusations and said he respects the youth protests against him. Pena Nieto said Thursday that a recent university event where protesters jeered at him was a ""rich experience."" ""It allowed me to see the interest there is among the youth to participate in this democratic process. How great that it is this way. It is a strength that we have built between all Mexicans,"" he said Thursday at a forum on security and justice . But Pena Nieto was less positive in comments to CNNMexico immediately after the May 11 event at the Iberoamerican University, where crowds booed and chanted ""get out"" at the candidate. ""They are not all genuine,"" Pena Nieto said. ""But in the end the free space of the university must be respected and I am totally and absolutely respectful."" Officials from Pena Nieto's campaign quickly dismissed the protests at the event, saying the outbursts were not from students, but from outsiders dragged there by political operatives to cause commotion. Three days later, a YouTube video featured 131 students flashing their university ID cards, saying ""We are students from Ibero. ... Nobody forced us to do anything."" The 11-minute video went viral. It has been viewed more than 1 million times in the past 10 days. Posts promoting protests throughout the country on social media in recent days have used it as a jumping off point, using the phrase ""#YoSoy132"" (""I am 132"") on Twitter and Facebook. Maria Elena Meneses, a professor who studies new technologies and information at Monterrey Tech, said the way the Ibero students' actions appeared to be triggering protests fueled by social media was ""unprecedented"" in Mexico. ""It is probably extreme to say that it is a Mexican Spring, alluding to (the protests) in North Africa, but nobody can dare to underestimate an action in which social networks were the catalyst for youth unrest,"" she wrote in an opinion column for CNNMexico.com this week. Many students in Mexico City on Wednesday said they were excited about the success of the protest, which police said more than 15,000 people attended. ""I believe in the movement. I believe young people, we have great power in our hands. We have information and media that other groups do not have,"" said Paula Diaz, 23, a student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. ""It is my duty to be here, informing people. I think we can do something great."" Some said the group needs stronger organization in order to prosper. ""We have to make the transition from noise to words,"" said Maria Fernanda Galicia, 22, a student at the Iberoamerican University. Protesters plan to meet  Saturday in a part of Mexico City known as Tlatelolco to form a more specific strategy and draw up goals for what they say is a burgeoning movement. ""There is a spark, but if we leave it apathetically, it will dissolve,"" said Angel Rodriguez, 19, a student at a music school run by Mexico's City's cultural ministry. The plaza where students say they are planning to meet this weekend has significant historical significance in Mexico. It is the site where many student protesters were killed during a rally in 1968. Increased democracy and free expression were among their demands at the time.","The surge of student activism comes at a key time during the presidential campaign .

"President Barack Obama formally opened his re-election bid Saturday with two rallies in which he highlighted accomplishments over his three and a half years in the White House and argued that America can't afford to adopt Republicans' ""bad ideas."" ""We are making progress and now we face a choice,"" said the president, at his first rally at the Schottenstein Center on the campus of The Ohio State University in Columbus. ""This is a make or break moment for the middle class, and we can't turn back now."" In this 36-minute-long address, Obama said presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney would ""rubber stamp"" the congressional GOP agenda, telling the crowd that ""we cannot give him that chance."" ""That's the choice in this election, and that's why I'm running for a second term as president of the United States,"" added Obama. The speech highlighted the narrative that the Obama campaign hopes to push this year: reminding voters how many millions of jobs were lost before the president took office. The president said that in the final six months of 2008, ""nearly three million of our neighbors lost their jobs."" But he said when he took office, ""We didn't quit. We don't quit. Together we are fighting our way back."" Obama touted the federal government's rescue of the big auto companies, and he criticized his challenger, saying ""when some wanted to let Detroit go bankrupt, we didn't turn our backs."" ""Today, America's auto industry is on top of the world,"" he said. The Michigan-born Romney, whose father was a former auto executive and governor of that state, opposed the bailout, saying a structured bankruptcy could have achieved the same result without the massive cost to the U.S. government. Moreover, the former Massachusetts governor has argued the Obama administration made too many concessions to auto unions as part of that bailout. The president also touted his foreign policy achievements, saying that ""for the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq."" He said that ""Osama bin Laden is no longer a threat to this country,"" and ""al Qaeda is on the path to defeat."" He then pledged that ""by 2014, the war in Afghanistan will be over,"" and pointed out that Romney had opposed setting a troop withdrawal deadline in that conflict. On the controversial issue of illegal immigration, Obama declared, ""It's time to stop denying citizenship to responsible young people just because they're the children of undocumented immigrants."" Romney took a hard stance against illegal immigration during the Republican primaries, opposing the president's push for a limited pathway to citizenship for some illegal immigrants. The issue is of importance to the growing Latino electorate in the United States. The Ohio arena, which holds around 20,000 people, appeared to be around two-thirds to three-quarters full, with around half of the seating in the upper deck empty. The Columbus fire department estimated the crowd size at 14,000. While smaller in size than many Obama rallies during the 2008 campaign, the crowd dwarfed the size of any rally held this cycle by Romney. The presumptive GOP nominee's campaign quickly reacted to the president's speech. ""The fact remains that American families are struggling on his watch: to pay their bills, find a job and keep their homes. While President Obama all but ignored his record over three and a half years in office, the American people won't. This November, they will hold him accountable for his broken promises and ineffective leadership,"" Romney campaign press secretary Andrea Saul said in a statement. Prior to Saturday's rally, the president had made 20 trips to Ohio since taking office. Romney returns to Ohio on Monday, his third trip to the Buckeye State in three weeks. Ohio's unemployment level stands at 7.5%, slightly lower than the national average of 8.1%. Ohio has become a crucial battleground state in recent presidential elections. The Buckeye State put President George W. Bush over the top in his 2004 re-election. Four years ago, Obama won Ohio by five percentage points over Sen. John McCain of Arizona. The most recent public opinion poll in Ohio, released earlier this week by Quinnipiac University, indicated a tie between Obama and Romney. According to the survey, 44% of registered voters supported Obama, with 42% backing Romney. The president's two-point margin was well with in the poll's sampling error. Acknowledging that his re-election bid faces hurdles, the president told those in the audience that ""Ohio, this election will be closer than the last."" And while he continuously talked about moving ""forward"" -- his 2012 campaign slogan -- in his speech, he did hark back to his 2008 slogan. ""If people ask what this campaign is about, you tell them it's still about hope, it's still about change,"" said Obama. After the Ohio speech, the president went to Virginia, another crucial battleground state, and held a rally on the Richmond campus of Virginia Commonwealth University. The Rams successful men's basketball coach Shaka Smart hosted the event at the school's Stuart C. Siegel Center. A fire marshal said that about 8,000 people were in attendance, filling the arena to capacity according to the Obama campaign. First lady Michele Obama introduced her husband, telling the crowd, ""We've come so far. We've got so much more to do."" The president then took the stage, offering a speech much like the one he'd made hours earlier in Ohio. He pointed to the ""progress"" made during his first term, and suggested Romney and ""his friends"" were delusional if they ""think that the same bad ideas will lead to a different result."" Obama ended his speech trying to fire up his supporters to ""stick with me, fight with me, and press on with me."" ""If you're willing to work even harder in this election than in the last election, I guarantee you we will move this country forward,"" he told the Richmond crowd. ""We will finish what we started.""","""We will finish what we started,"" Obama tells backers at a Virginia rally .

"(CNN)A St. Louis man has filed a lawsuit alleging excessive force in a case that involves an officer turning off a dashcam that was recording the man's arrest. At one point in the video from the dashcam, a female officer can be heard saying: ""Hold up, everybody, hold up. We're red right now so if you guys are worried about cameras just wait."" The phrase ""we're red right now"" indicates that a camera is recording. A second dashcam continued to record. Video of the April arrest shows officers stopping a vehicle being driven by Cortez Bufford, whose car roughly matched the description of one possibly involved in an area shooting. As officers approached the vehicle, they ordered Bufford and his passenger to show their hands. They did. According to the police report, one officer smelled marijuana and saw what looked to be plastic baggies full of a leafy green substance. The passenger was ordered from the vehicle, and he was handcuffed without incident. Bufford was also ordered to exit the vehicle, but he refused and became increasingly agitated, according to the report. He was then removed. While officers attempted to place him in handcuffs, one saw the handle of a handgun sticking out of Bufford's right front pocket. According to the report, Bufford was seen reaching for the weapon. The video then shows officers kicking Bufford while he is on the ground. According to his suit, Bufford suffered abrasions to his fingers, face, back, head, ears and neck. He was handcuffed after an officer used a Taser on him. A loaded handgun was later removed from Bufford's pocket. An attorney representing the city and the police department defended the officers' actions in the arrest, while condemning the officer who turned off the dashcam, which is against department policy. ""The officers were not acting out of line at any time during the arrest. The person involved in this altercation had a semi-automatic gun, and the officers were protecting themselves and the public. They did what had to be done to protect themselves,"" Winston Calvert told CNN. He said the use of force and the dashcam issues are separate. The officer who shut off the dashcam video was referred to an internal affairs department, Calvert said. ""The city's Police Department has a policy on the use of dash cameras and other cameras, and the Police Department special order says the cameras should be left on until the event is concluded. When we saw that an officer had violated that policy, it was very disappointing,"" he said. ""The internal affairs recommended discipline for the officer, which is what happened."" Because the case is still open to appeal, Calvert declined to say what the punishment was. He said the officer, who he identified as Kelli Swinton, remains on the job while her appeal is underway. A call to the officer's lawyer was not returned. Attorney Joel Schwartz, who represents Bufford, is urging reform. All of the charges against his client have been dismissed. According to a statement from St. Louis prosecutor Jennifer M. Joyce, the ""action of turning off the dash camera video diminished the evidentiary merits of the case."" ""I don't think an officer on the scene should have the capability to stop the camera from rolling. Otherwise it defeats the entire purpose of having body cameras and/or dashcams,"" Schwartz said.

"The United States believes Israel has conducted an airstrike into Syria, two U.S. officials first told CNN. U.S. and Western intelligence agencies are reviewing classified data showing Israel most likely conducted a strike in the Thursday-Friday time frame, according to both officials.  This is the same time frame that the U.S. collected additional data showing Israel was flying a high number of warplanes over Lebanon. One official said the United States had limited information so far and could not yet confirm those are the specific warplanes that conducted a strike.  Based on initial indications, the U.S. does not believe Israeli warplanes entered Syrian airspace to conduct the strikes. Both officials said there is no reason to believe Israel struck at a chemical weapons storage facilities. The Israelis have long said they would strike at any targets that prove to be the transfer of any kinds of weapons to Hezbollah or other terrorist groups, as well as at any effort to smuggle Syrian weapons into Lebanon that could threaten Israel. The Lebanese army website listed 16 flights by Israeli warplanes penetrating Lebanon's airspace from Thursday evening through Friday afternoon local time. The Israeli military had no comment. But a source in the Israeli defense establishment told CNN's Sara Sidner, ""We will do whatever is necessary to stop the transfer of weapons from Syria to terrorist organizations.  We have done it in the past and we will do it if necessary the future.""","Sources say a strike mostly likely occurred in the Thursday-Friday time frame .

"John Kerry wasn't the first to use the A-word -- apartheid -- when talking about Israel, and he likely won't be the last. Even some Israeli leaders have mentioned the word that basically means ""separate"" in describing the eventual result if a Jewish state had a Palestinian majority in some areas, such as currently exists in the West Bank. However, the U.S. secretary of state touched a diplomatic live wire last week when he predicted an apartheid situation if Israel and the Palestinians fail to agree on a two-state solution for their decades-long conflict. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a tea party favorite and possible presidential candidate, called for Kerry's resignation, while pro-Israel groups accused America's top diplomat of inappropriate language and insensitivity. The backlash reflected both the hyper-partisanship of a U.S. election year and the high stakes of Middle East peace talks pushed by Kerry that have effectively broken down in the latest episode of a dispute that seems to define the word intractable. ""Unwise, ill-timed and ill-advised"" ""This was unwise, ill-timed and ill-advised for sure, but it's not going to make much of a difference frankly in the overall arc of the process that's promising only diminishing returns,"" said Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. negotiator on the Israel-Palestinian issue. Kerry issued a statement on Monday acknowledging he used the wrong word in comments to a closed-door meeting of the Trilateral Commission of private sector leaders from North America, Europe and Asia. At the same time, he  vigorously defended his long-held support for Israel and commitment to finding a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict. ""I will not allow my commitment to Israel to be questioned by anyone, particularly for partisan, political purposes, so I want to be crystal clear about what I believe and what I don't believe,"" he said. ""I have been around long enough to also know the power of words to create a mis-impression, even when unintentional, and if I could rewind the tape, I would have chosen a different word to describe my firm belief that the only way in the long term to have a Jewish state and two nations and two peoples living side by side in peace and security is through a two-state solution,"" he added. Apartheid was the reviled system of racial segregation implemented by the white-minority government in South Africa for decades before the country transitioned to a multiparty democracy that was first led by Nelson Mandela. A series of laws determined where black South Africans could live, work and go to school, who they could marry, and even which beaches they could use. The intent was to maintain power for the white minority while stripping blacks of all rights of citizenship. In the rhetoric of the Middle East dispute, Palestinian nationalists and others have accused Israel of apartheid-like policies, an accusation vehemently denied by Israeli authorities. Palestinians with citizenship rights comprise a minority of Israel's population, but non-citizen Palestinians in the West Bank and other territories face severe security restrictions that limit their movement and other basic freedoms. Palestinians in Israel . Some Israeli officials have acknowledged that failure to reach a peace agreement that creates a Palestinian state alongside the Jewish state would result in non-Israeli Palestinians living in Israel without the same rights as Israeli citizens, including the right to vote. ""As long as in this territory west of the Jordan River there is only one political entity called Israel, it is going to be either non-Jewish or non-democratic,"" former Prime Minister Ehud Barak said in 2010 when he was defense minister. ""If this bloc of millions of Palestinians cannot vote, that will be an apartheid state."" Other Israelis who have warned about a future apartheid state include former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, the government's chief negotiator. Kerry's statement cited such comments, saying that ""in the long term, a unitary, binational state cannot be the democratic Jewish state that Israel deserves or the prosperous state with full rights that the Palestinian people deserve."" Like Kerry, Israeli officials also have warned of potential increased violence from a growing Palestinian independence movement without a two-state agreement, as well as possible increased international condemnation for the situation on the ground. Tuesday was the nine-month deadline Kerry set last year for coming up with some form of agreement in the talks. Despite Kerry's repeated trips to the region to try to push the negotiations forward, the process hit a road block last week when the Palestinians announced they would combine rival movements Fatah and Hamas to form a unity government. Israel's Security Cabinet subsequently announced the country won't hold talks with a Palestinian government that includes Hamas, which the United States considers a terrorist organization. International pressure . Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat issued a statement Tuesday that blamed Israel for the breakdown in the talks and said ""we believe that the international community must now do what is needed, in order to make clear to Israel that choosing settlements and apartheid over peace has a political, legal and economic cost."" Kerry's controversial comments were reported Sunday by the Daily Beast, based on a secret recording of his remarks. Before his statement Monday that served as confirmation of the Daily Beast report, critics attacked. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee called the apartheid remark ""deeply troubling,"" while Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, issued a statement calling reports that Kerry used such language ""startling and deeply disappointing."" ""Even if he used the repugnant language of Israel's adversaries and accusers to express concern for Israel's future, it was undiplomatic, unwise and unfair,"" Foxman said. ""Such references are not seen as expressions of friendship and support."" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican who is the highest-ranking Jewish member of Congress, said the word apartheid ""has routinely been dismissed as both offensive and inaccurate, and Secretary Kerry's use of it makes peace even harder to achieve."" Cruz said Kerry should step down because ""there is no place for this word in the context of the state of Israel."" On Tuesday, other Republicans also weighed in. ""The secretary of state of the United States -- his words or her words -- carry great weight,"" GOP Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming told MSNBC. ""And I think what the secretary said was hurtful and harmful and he should have apologized."" U.S. politics at play . Some Democrats also criticized Kerry. Alaska Sen. Mark Begich chided him for improperly expressing his frustration over the foundering peace talks. Begich faces a tough re-election race in November in his traditionally Republican state. Support for Israel is an essential policy for candidates seeking to win votes from the political right and center. Meanwhile, some pro-Israel voices backed Kerry's analysis of the situation. In a statement on its website, the U.S. group J Street said ""Israel today is not an apartheid state, and that's not what Secretary of State Kerry said."" ""For over a year now, Kerry has argued that, without a two-state solution, Israel is risking its future and its values as it moves toward permanent rule over millions of Palestinians without equal rights,"" said the J Street statement. ""Former Prime Ministers Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert have used the 'apartheid' term as well to describe this possible future. Instead of putting energy into attacking Secretary Kerry, those who are upset with the secretary's use of the term should put their energy into opposing and changing the policies that are leading Israel down this road."" At the State Department on Tuesday, spokeswoman Jen Psaki made a similar point when reporters grilled her about whether Kerry's statement the night before amounted to an apology. ""He still believes that, as many Israeli officials have stated, there would be challenges to a unitary state,"" Psaki said. Former President Jimmy Carter came under similar criticism when he published a book on the Middle East conflict titled ""Palestine: Peace, Not Apartheid"" in 2006. ""Most of the criticisms of the book have been the one word in the title, 'apartheid,' "" Carter said in 2007, adding that the ""mandatory separation"" inside the Palestinian territories and ""terrible persecution and oppression of the Palestinians by the Israelis"" was ""a basic issue that has got to be corrected before Israel can have peace.""","Sec. Kerry takes heat for saying what some Israeli leaders have expressed .

"It should have been a great morning for Richie Incognito. A brand new black Ferrari was delivered to his Florida house on Tuesday. Instead he is at the center of national media attention and exiled from his NFL team after a Miami Dolphins teammate made allegations of misconduct against him. Dolphins coach Joe Philbin suspended Incognito on Sunday night. ""You know, I'm just trying to weather the storm right now. And this will pass,"" he told CNN affiliate WSVN outside a doctor's office in Weston, Florida, on Tuesday. Incognito said he didn't want to comment on media reports that he sent line-mate Jonathan Martin voice mails containing racial slurs and threats of physical violence. When asked about his status with the team, Incognito closed the door to his car without answering and drove away. ESPN, NFL.com and other media outlets reported that representatives for Martin on Sunday submitted the voice mails and texts to the league and the Dolphins. One of the messages, from April, contained a reference to Martin's biracial background, according to ESPN's sources. ""Hey, wassup, you half (expletive) piece of (expletive). I saw you on Twitter, you been training 10 weeks. I'll (expletive) in your (expletive) mouth. I'm gonna slap your (expletive) mouth, I'm gonna slap your real mother across the face (laughter). (Expletive) you, you're still a rookie. I'll kill you."" Philbin told reporters on Monday he made the decision to suspend Incognito ""based on the information that I had at that time."" He didn't give a reason for the move. Martin left the team suddenly last week and has not commented publicly on why he walked away in the middle of the season. He remains on the team's roster (meaning he will be paid for this week), though last week he was listed as inactive with an ""illness."" Also Tuesday, celebrity gossip website TMZ posted a video of Incognito at a bar, shouting at the top of his lungs while pacing wildly around a pool table topless. He uses profanity and the N-word in referring to one of his teammates who is also there. Martin doesn't appear in the video and TMZ only said the video was recorded earlier this year. CNN reached out multiple times to representatives for each player but hasn't received comment. Richie Incognito, Jonathan Martin, and the NFL's future . Cafeteria incident sparked departure . Last week, the Dolphins announced Martin had taken ""a leave of absence."" Philbin said Martin left the team after an incident at the team's cafeteria. Jay Glazer, an NFL analyst for FoxSports.com, reported that some of his teammates got up from a lunch table as a joke when Martin sat down. The lineman threw his food tray hard to the ground, he reported. Glazer later tweeted the incident was a final straw for Martin. The coach said representatives for Martin contacted the team on Sunday with their concerns. The Dolphins spent Sunday gathering information, after which he suspended Incognito, Philbin said. Several media outlets said Martin had left the Dolphins because of bullying, something Incognito denied on Twitter. ""Shame on you for attaching my name to false speculation,"" one of the tweets said, according to Bleacher Report. That tweet and others addressed to various media outlets were later deleted. A post from Sunday remained a day later: ""Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth -- Buddha."" Philbin said he met with Martin and also talked with members of his family before Sunday, and the second-year player didn't say anything about player misconduct. The team said Sunday in a statement that Incognito, a nine-year veteran at offensive guard, was suspended for detrimental conduct. ""We believe in maintaining a culture of respect for one another and as a result we believe this decision is in the best interest of the organization at this time,"" the team said in a statement on its website. The Miami Herald reported that a Dolphins source said Incognito is ""done"" with the team. A Dolphins spokesman had no comment. 'Teddy bear off the field' Chris Draft played with Incognito when both were with the St. Louis Rams in 2007 and 2008. Incognito's on-field aggressive persona was nothing like his personality away from the playing field, Draft said. ""He was really kind of a big teddy bear off the field. My wife actually loved him,"" he said. The Sporting News takes a yearly poll of NFL players, and in 2009 they dubbed Incognito the dirtiest player in the league. The Rams released Incognito in December 2009 after an argument during a game with then-head coach Steve Spagnuolo. He played with the Buffalo Bills for three games before joining the Dolphins. Incognito, who played in the Pro Bowl all-star game in January, appeared to have calmed down on the field, according to a profile on NFL.com. Incognito pointed to meditation as a positive tool he used. The NFL will review the case, league spokesman Greg Aiello said Monday. ""I will tell you that if the review shows that this is not a safe atmosphere I will take whatever measures are necessary to assure that it is,"" Philbin said. ""I have that obligation to the players that I coach on a daily basis."" The NFL Players Association has said the union has not started an investigation. NFL's pecking order . Dolphins rookie Will Davis said he hasn't experienced any acts of bullying or hazing. ""I think a lot of people think of hazing as being cruel, but I don't see anything like that in this locker room,"" he said. ""But it depends on how you take hazing. I've always thought the guys in here were great."" He said everyone on the team loves Incognito. ""I was shocked,"" he said. Wide receiver Mike Wallace said there was a lot of respect for both players. ""I know both of those guys personally,"" he said. ""I feel like they are both good guys."" Former Dolphins linebacker Channing Crowder told ""Piers Morgan Live"" that a locker room is often a place where players are trying to establish a pecking order. People cannot compare it to working at a regular job, he said, because it involves physically aggressive men with big egos competing and trying to prove their manhood. NFL players are ""a bunch of testosterone-filled alpha males who are trying to find their place on the totem pole,"" he told Morgan. He said when Incognito joined the team, he would test people to see where he stood with them. ""He is a guy that needs to know his place with you,"" Crowder said. Incognito also apparently liked to play pranks. In a segment shown on an HBO series that follows one NFL team during each preseason, Incognito figured out a teammate's iPad password. He then teased the player about a status update he made for the player and joked about the player's fiancee. ""Hard Knocks"" has given audiences a look inside team dynamics, sometimes giving viewers a glimpse at life for rookies. And inevitably some of the younger players get hazed. Hazing on the decline? Still, former Dolphins running back Ricky Williams said it occurs less frequently in the NFL than most people think. ""Really I haven't seen much hazing,"" he said in an interview on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" He said it's a well-known ""rite of passage"" for a high draft pick to pick up a big dinner bill for some other players on the team. ""Once you sign that contract there's a lot of rules, written and unwritten, that you are expected to follow,"" he said. ""For me, this is something that should be handled internally. I don't think the media, I don't think fans, I don't think anyone outside is really in a position to really fully understand what occurs inside of a locker room and inside of a football team.""","Suspended lineman Richie Incognito says this storm will pass .

"Four years after Jerry Ford's presidency ended in the ashes of his Watergate pardon of Richard Nixon, he vaulted back onto center stage at his party's 1980 national convention. It started as a buzz on the floor of the Joe Louis Arena on Detroit's newly renovated riverfront -- talk of a Republican ""dream ticket"" to take on President Jimmy Carter. The intriguing scenario would pair GOP primary victor Ronald Reagan and for what would have been the first time in history, a former president as his running mate. It became a roar when Ford granted an interview to CBS' Walter Cronkite to acknowledge that discussions were taking place. ""This was supposed to be a very ho-hum convention,"" recalled Bernard Shaw, who co-anchored CNN's inaugural convention coverage just six weeks after the launch of the 24-hour news network, working ""up in the rafters with a couple of pieces of plywood over chairs for myself and Daniel Schorr."" But it turned into ""a very brokered affair,"" Shaw said, ""with Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford flirting with the idea of a shared presidency."" Biden to be in Tampa during Republican National Convention . The actual discussions involved close aides to the two men, including former Ford administration officials who a close Ford friend believes were trying to advance their own agendas. ""If I remember correctly, Jerry Ford came up to me earlier that day and told me that he was into these discussions, but he didn't think they were going anywhere,"" Peter Secchia, Michigan's GOP national committeeman at the convention, said in a recent telephone interview. All the media attention that day was focused on the role Ford might play in a Reagan White House, with major responsibilities over foreign policy and fiscal issues, and the possibility of top Cabinet positions for such Ford administration luminaries as Henry Kissinger and Alan Greenspan. Secchia, a business owner in his district befriended by Ford during his early years in Congress, never actually worked for Ford but later served as U.S. ambassador to Italy, appointed by the man Reagan chose for vice president that very night -- George H.W. Bush. Reagan makes surprise, post-midnight announcement . Bush's selection was hastily arranged after the talks with Ford broke down. The pick was announced by Reagan in a surprise post-midnight appearance at the convention hall a night earlier than scheduled with Bush watching on TV from his room across the street at the Hotel Pontchartrain. By all accounts, it happened in a matter of minutes after Bush agreed during a short phone call to disavow his pro-choice posture on abortion and his condemnation of what he had branded ""voodoo economics."" Reagan told the convention that Bush had endorsed his GOP platform planks calling for a constitutional ban against abortion and advancing the principles of ""supply-side economics"" that still guide the party today. Poll: Ahead of GOP convention, presidential race in dead heat . Secchia never bought into the idea of a Reagan-Ford ticket for a simple reason overlooked by most observers at the time -- both men then lived in California ""and one of them would have had to move."" The Constitution bars each state's representatives to the Electoral College electors from voting for a ballot in which both candidates are from their state. In other words, a Reagan-Ford ticket would have forced California's electors to vote Democratic, whatever the popular vote. He did not believe either man would have been willing to change his primary residence, as Ford's onetime chief of staff Dick Cheney did when he moved back to Wyoming from Texas to become George W. Bush's running mate 20 years later and perhaps the most influential vice president in modern history. Shaw, now retired, has covered 14 political conventions dating to 1968 when Republicans nominated Richard Nixon in Miami Beach at what Shaw called the first convention ""perfectly scripted for TV."" He also was in Chicago for that year's Democratic Convention, disrupted by anti-Vietnam war street protests, a vicious police response and a party division over the war that was a big factor in Hubert Humphrey's November defeat by Nixon. Today's conventions tend to be even more scripted than Nixon's GOP gathering in 1968, but Shaw says ""occasionally the curtains part and you get a chance to see the real rawness of politics and the fight for power."" In convention speeches, history is made . He said journalists should avoid any preconceived attitude that conventions are non-events. ""A reporter who goes to a convention with the notion that these are meaningless -- the days of smoke-filled rooms are over -- is the reporter who is ill-equipped for the job,"" Shaw said. Drama at both conventions in 1980 . In 1980, there were two good examples of that -- and I had the privilege of covering both the Republicans in Detroit and the once-again divided Democrats at New York's Madison Square Garden, the first of seven political conventions I've worked at as a newsman. For the Democrats, it was the year that Ted Kennedy refused to give up after losing to a sitting president in his party's primaries and pursuing a challenge of delegate rules until just before a scheduled floor vote for the nomination. In a stirring concession speech, he gave a passing tip of the hat to Jimmy Carter -- ""I congratulate President Carter on his victory here"" -- and then brought the delegates to their feet when he bowed out of the race by saying: ""For me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end.  For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives and the dream will never die."" Ann Romney expected to kick off GOP convention . Then, after Carter's acceptance speech, the moment we had all been waiting for -- the traditional embrace of the nominee and challenger, a moment that never came. Kennedy climbed back up the podium, and with the crowd cheering his every movement, twirled around the stage shaking hands with party dignitaries, their spouses, the first lady and finally the president -- an awkward looking gesture that was over in the blink of an eye. ""This is a schizophrenic convention,"" Dan Schorr told CNN's audience. ""They nominated Mr. Carter and they gave their love to Mr. Kennedy. They have given their votes to one and their hearts to another."" The senator then quickly exited, only to return for another quick handshake and pat on the shoulder for the president at a moment the two men had the stage mostly to themselves. ""There's no embrace,"" Schorr said. ""No holding of hands, no V for victory,"" Shaw added. In November, the Reagan-Bush ticket won in an electoral landslide. Carter was handicapped by his divided party, high inflation and rising interest rates, and a hostage crisis in Iran that dragged on until the moment Reagan was sworn in as his successor. Agencies warn of possible anarchist activity at conventions . Bush presents Quayle in dramatic fashion . After eight years in office, Bush became the party's presidential nominee and presented his running mate to GOP delegates in New Orleans in dramatic fashion, arriving near the convention site on a riverboat that also was transporting a clueless traveling press. ""We didn't know who it was going to be,"" recalled George Weeks, who covered that convention as a columnist for the Detroit News after serving as chief of staff for William G. Milliken, Michigan's Republican governor in 1980. There were several big name possibilities, including Rep. Jack Kemp, father of ""supply side"" economics and mentor for Mitt Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan. Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, a future presidential nominee, and his wife, Elizabeth, transportation secretary for much of Reagan's presidency were other names mentioned. Way down on the list -- a name I had first noticed in a New York Times ""veepstakes"" story that morning or the day before -- was a little known senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle, a baby-faced baby boomer who, at 41, was even younger than Ryan. His selection on Day 2 of the convention may even have been a surprise to him. He got the word from Bush only a short time before the announcement, and hurried over to the riverfront for a rally with Bush and their cheering supporters. ""It's not a lark, it's Quayle,"" local TV reporter Gary Tuchman, now a CNN correspondent, told viewers of WPEC in West Palm Beach, Florida, announcing the news in a live shot just ""100 feet from where Quayle was standing."" ""It was still the pre-Twitter days, and the viewers were learning it from me,"" he says now with a laugh. Politics, parties keep some away from conventions . A less-than-stellar debut for a rising star . The Bush-Quayle ticket triumphed in November over another former Massachusetts governor, Michael Dukakis, and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who had been chosen at their party's convention in Atlanta now remembered mostly for the nearly disastrous debut performance of a rising Democratic star, 41-year-old Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. Clinton, who already had a reputation as a spellbinding orator, was picked to place Dukakis' name in nomination a night after a rousing Jesse Jackson address party officials feared would steal the thunder from Dukakis, the political embodiment of laid back. But Clinton went on so long -- more than 33 minutes, nearly twice his allotted time -- the clearly annoyed delegates were squirming in their seats, some even booing.  As the young governor uttered the words, ""In closing ...,"" the hall erupted in boisterous cheers. Just four years later, it was Clinton who was getting nominated, and later elected, depriving the senior Bush of a second term. This year he will return to his 1988 role, delivering the nominating speech in Charlotte, North Carolina, for Barack Obama's bid for re-election. ""This party loves Bill Clinton,"" said Mark Brewer, state Democratic chairman in Michigan for the past 17 years who will attend this year's convention as a ""super-delegate."" After all these years, still ""The Comeback Kid."" Memorable convention moments .

"Three British men have been accused of plotting to decapitate a member of the public in the street, a court in London heard Thursday. British prosecutors said the men were inspired by a speech from the terror group ISIS, which called for attacks on ""disbelievers."" Nadir Sayed, 21; Yousaf Syed, 19, and Haseeb Hamayoon, 27, were charged Thursday with preparing acts of terrorism, according to London's Metropolitan Police. Prosecutor Rebecca Munday claimed the men planned to behead a member of the public with knives. ""These are serious charges, the evidence of which has been set out in a lengthy case summary,"" Munday told the court. ""In relation to that this appears to be an incident where there was an attack planned in the United Kingdom which seemed imminent."" The suspects were arrested in and around London on November 6 in the run-up to Remembrance Sunday -- when Britain marks the end of World War I -- along with a fourth man who was later released without charge. Armed police -- who are rarely deployed in the United Kingdom -- took part in three of the four arrests, though no shots were fired, police said at the time. The accused had been held in custody for two weeks -- the maximum time allowed under UK anti-terror laws before suspects must be charged. There's been a marked increase in the number of people taken into custody recently under Britain's Terrorism Act 2000. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said last month that counter-terrorism officers were ""running exceptionally high numbers of counter-terrorism investigations, the likes of which we have not seen for several years."" In the year up to October 17, there had been 218 terror-related arrests, he said, adding that officers are disrupting ""several attack plots a year."" Many of the most recent terrorism-related arrests have been in London, the nation's capital and the site of deadly coordinated 2005 suicide attacks, as well as the 2013 public slaying of British soldier Lee Rigby -- who was hit with a car  and then attacked with knives by two men who were later found guilty of his murder and imprisoned for life. The UK government raised its terror threat level from ""substantial"" to ""severe"" -- the fourth-highest of five levels -- in late August in response to ISIS militants' surge in Iraq and Syria and their threats against the West. At the time, UK Home Secretary Theresa May said ""that means that a terrorist attack is highly likely, but there is no intelligence to suggest that an attack is imminent."" None of the men in court Thursday entered a plea. They are next due to appear at London's Central Criminal Court on December 4.","Three British men were charged Thursday with preparing acts of terrorism .

"Archaeologists working alongside builders on a new London rail link have turned up a grisly find that harks back seven centuries, to a time when Black Death stalked the medieval city. A shaft sunk for the underpinnings of the new Crossrail link in Farringdon revealed 13 skeletons, lined up neatly in two rows, the company said Friday. Suspicions are that the dig has revealed a ""plague pit"" -- one of many mass graves used to dispose of the bodies of those who succumbed to the Black Death, or bubonic plague, in the 14th century. Since then, the bones have lain undisturbed just 2.5 meters (8 feet) below the surface in one of the few areas of the central London neighborhood not to have been developed over the years. Historical records talk of a ""no man's land"" established in 1348 in the Farringdon area, where some 50,000 plague victims were buried, according to a contemporary historian. Up to now the area has never been found. The shaft sunk as part of Crossrail's construction is located on the edge of Charterhouse Square in Farringdon, formerly the site of a monastery. Crossrail's lead archaeologist, Jay Carver, quoted in a company media release, said it was ""a highly significant discovery,"" and one that left many questions still to answer. ""We will be undertaking scientific tests on the skeletons over the coming months to establish their cause of death, whether they were plague victims from the 14th century or later London residents, how old they were and perhaps evidence of who they were,"" he said. Body found under parking lot is King Richard III, scientists confirm . ""However, at this early stage, the depth of burials, the pottery found with the skeletons and the way the skeletons have been set out, all point towards this being part of the 14th century emergency burial ground."" The pottery found with the skeletons dates to before 1350, the archaeologists said. The skeletons are being excavated and taken to the Museum of London Archeology for further testing. Scientists hope to extract a DNA profile that could be used to study the development of plague since then. However, there is no risk to people's health now because the plague bacteria cannot survive long in the soil, Crossrail says. Eventually, the shaft will be sunk 20 meters deep to support the Crossrail tunneling works. The archaeologists may turn up other unexpected finds as they dig back through soil packed down over centuries. The Yersinia pestis bacterium that is behind the plague is found mainly in rodents, particularly rats, and in the fleas that feed on them, the U.S. National Institutes of Health website says. Each year, roughly 10 to 20 people in the United States develop plague from flea or rodent bites, mostly from infected prairie dogs in rural southwestern areas, the NIH says. About one in seven of those infected dies. No person-to-person transmission has been recorded in the past 90 years. In the 1300s, the Black Death killed an estimated 20 million to 30 million people in Europe, the NIH says. Another 12 million fell victim to the scourge in China in the mid-19th century, and smaller outbreaks have occurred elsewhere. Once completed, the Crossrail route will run 73 miles from east to west across London, improving access to Heathrow Airport, central London and towns to the east. Central London services could start as soon as 2018. Opinion: After Richard III, can we find Genghis Khan? According to the company, it is currently running the country's largest archaeology program. Other finds turned up in the course of excavations for the rail route include bones from prehistoric animals, Bronze Age and Roman tools, and the largest piece of amber ever uncovered in Britain. Archaeologists also found a former cemetery in excavations near Liverpool Street, where 300 skeletons were found. Those are thought to have been buried between 1500 and 1700.

"New York Knicks point guard Raymond Felton, who was arrested on felony weapons charges, posted $25,000 bail Tuesday. Felton's wife,  Ariane, accompanied by her attorney, turned his high-powered FNH 5.7 x 28mm semi-automatic handgun over to police Monday, claiming she didn't want the weapon in the couple's Upper West Side Manhattan apartment, a law enforcement official said. The weapon, similar to the one Maj. Nidal Hasan used in the Fort Hood shooting rampage in 2009, was loaded with 18 high-velocity bullets, the official said. The Feltons are in the process of divorcing, the official said. Though Felton's wife said he never threatened her with the gun, she told police that he held the gun during arguments in their apartment. She also told police that he owns other guns in North Carolina. A judge Tuesday issued a temporary restraining order against Felton, who is to appear in court June 2. Felton, accompanied by his attorney, left court without comment. According to LinkedIn, Ariane Felton is a Cornell University graduate now studying law at Fordham University. The point guard was arrested a couple of hours after the Knicks lost to the Dallas Mavericks at New York's Madison Square Garden. The Knicks have not commented on the arrest. Felton, 29, who was arrested at 12:50 a.m. Tuesday, had been held on charges of criminal possession of a weapon in the second, third and fourth degrees, New York Police Sgt. John Buthorn said. Those counts relate to allegations that Felton illegally had a firearm and a loaded ammunition magazine, police said. Felton played 33 minutes, scoring 8 points, in the Knicks' 110-108 loss to the Mavericks on Monday night. Felton returned to the Knicks in July 2012 as a replacement for popular point guard Jeremy Lin. New York has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. Former New York Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress was sentenced to two years in prison after a plea deal on a firearm charge in 2009. Burress was shot in his thigh when his gun accidentally went off in a club.","Raymond Felton arrested on initial charges of criminal possession of a weapon .

"The family of Kendrick Johnson filed a wrongful death lawsuit against school officials claiming their lack of action led to his death at the hands of another student. Johnson's body was found in a rolled-up mat in the Lowndes High School gymnasium on January 11, 2013. His parents earlier filed a negligence lawsuit against the south Georgia school district claiming it was negligent and violated Johnson's constitutional right to equal protection based on race.  Johnson, 17 when he died, was African-American. The new lawsuit accuses the Lowndes County Board of Education, its superintendent and the high school principal of ignoring reports that Johnson was repeatedly attacked and harassed by a white student. ""As a direct result of and proximate result of defendants' aforesaid actions and omissions, on or about January 10, 2013, Kendrick Lamar Johnson was violently assaulted, severely injured, suffered great physical pain and mental anguish, and subjected to insult and loss of life, all of which took place at the hands of one or more students while on the property of Lowndes High School and during its normal hours of operations,"" the lawsuit said. The complaint said school officials knew about an attack on Johnson by a white student during a school bus trip a year earlier and another attack later. The other student ""had a history of provoking and attacking"" Johnson at school, the lawsuit said. Johnson was ""victimized"" again ""in the presence of the coaching staff and employees"" of the school again after his mother complained about the attacks, the suit said. After Johnson was ""improperly accused and blamed for instigating"" a school bus fight, school officials refused to let his mother see the bus surveillance video, the filing said. Johnson was ""subjected to undeserved punishment, humiliation and various forms of mistreatment by members of the coaching staff"" of the football program, leading to his decision to quit the football team, the suit said. The older brother of the student who attacked Johnson confronted him and told him ""it ain't over,"" the lawsuit said. Feds subpoena Kendrick Johnson's schoolmates amid probe into teen's death . No school official interviewed Johnson or his friends who witnessed the attacks, the suit said. ""This failure to act despite actual knowledge that Kendrick Lamar Johnson was being harassed departed from the defendant Lowndes County School System's own established procedures dealing with harassment and mistreatment, including racial discrimination,"" the suit said. School officials also failed to ""properly monitor the activities of students throughout all areas"" of the campus and to ""maintain a properly functioning video surveillance system,"" the family's suit contends. Investigators with the Sheriff's Office ruled his death accidental -- concluding that Johnson climbed into the center of the gym mat to reach for a shoe and got stuck. Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson believe that their son was beaten to death. They hired an independent pathologist, who found ""unexplained apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma"" to the teen's neck and concluded the death was a homicide. State board: Filling Kendrick Johnson's body with newspaper not illegal . The U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia launched a federal investigation into the case on October 31, 2013.

"[Update 2:15 p.m. ET]  ""We are taking precautions to protect elected officials in the county,"" Kaufman County, Texas, Sheriff David Byrnes said at a news conference Sunday after District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were found dead Saturday in their home. [Posted at 9:29 a.m. ET] . Two months ago, a Texas district attorney vowed to put away the ""scum"" who had killed one of his top deputies. Now, the district attorney and his wife are dead. And authorities aren't sure whether their killings are part of a broader scheme targeting criminal justice officials. The bodies of Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were found Saturday in their home in Kaufman County, east of Dallas. ""I don't know of anyone who would want to cause him harm,"" Kaufman city Mayor William Fortner said. ""As far as I could tell, he was doing a really good job as a district attorney."" Fortner said police are taking ""extra precautions"" to try to ensure no one else is targeted. ""We lost some important people, and we hope the killers are caught before any more people are lost,"" he said. A law enforcement official told The Dallas Morning News that a door was apparently kicked in, and ""there are shell casings everywhere."" Authorities have not identified a suspect. Nor are they sure whether the deaths are related to the killing of Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, who was killed on his way to work in January. The county sheriff's office brought in the FBI and the Texas Rangers to help with the investigation. McLelland was an Army veteran who later earned a master's in psychology and became a psychologist for the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, the district attorney's website said. He was raised in the small town of Wortham, Texas, where his parents had a ranch. He joined the Army after attending the University of Texas and spent 23 years in the service. He later earned his law degree and practiced as a defense attorney and mental health judge for 18 years before becoming the county's district attorney in 2010. McLelland and his wife leave behind two daughters and three sons. One son is a Dallas police officer. Another top prosecutor slain . The McLellands were killed almost exactly two months after Hasse was shot to death in broad daylight outside the county courthouse on January 31. Hasse had feared for his life and carried a gun to work, said a Dallas attorney who described herself as his longtime friend. Colleen A. Dunbar said she spoke with Hasse on January 24. She said the prosecutor told her he began carrying a gun in and out of the county courthouse daily. ""He told me he would use a different exit every day because he was fearful for his life,"" Dunbar told CNN. She said that Hasse gave no specifics on why he felt threatened -- only that he did. McLelland called Hasse ""a stellar prosecutor"" who knew that threats were part of the job. He vowed after Hasse's slaying to put away the ""scum"" who killed his deputy. ""I hope that the people that did this are watching, because we're very confident that we're going to find you,"" McLelland told reporters. ""We're going to pull you out of whatever hole you're in, we're going to bring you back and let the people of Kaufman County prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.""","Mayor: ""We hope the killers are caught before any more people are lost""

"The bereavement fare was once the airline industry's gift to the traveler, an acknowledgement that a customer was flying for the saddest of reasons: a medical emergency or death in the family. The last thing anyone wanted to worry about was the cost of an airplane ticket. And so many airlines offered discounts to help ease the pain of the journey. Not so much anymore. In the wake of its merger with US Airways, American Airlines this week became the latest major U.S. airline to end its policy of offering bereavement fares. US Airways didn't offer the special fares before the merger, and American's new chief executive officer, Douglas Parker, came from the ranks of US Airways. ""We remain committed to doing all we can to relieve the burden of travel for our customers in times of need. With the advent of more choices, lower cost carriers and larger networks, the industry has started to move away from bereavement fares because walk-up fares are generally lower than in the past, and customers now have more opportunities to find affordable fares at the last minute,"" American spokesman Matt Miller said in a statement. ""American is moving toward that industry trend and the airline offers customers changeable and refundable options with the ability to apply future reservations to bereavement travel without change fees. We believe this policy is a cost-effective solution for customers in need of bereavement travel."" Except for possibly waiving the change fee, the new policy doesn't sound so different from what American offers other customers. But not every carrier is going the way of American, at least not yet. Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are keeping their current bereavement policies in place. 'Better service' for consumers promised . Before the US Airways-American merger was approved last year, Parker, then the US Airways CEO, testified before Congress that consumers would benefit from such consolidation. ""By putting these two airlines together we're able to provide better service, more efficient service, to consumers,"" Parker said. It remains to be seen if consumers will agree with his sentiments, but American isn't breaking new ground with this particular policy change. Making planes in the world's biggest building . Discount carriers Southwest Airlines (and its AirTran brand) and JetBlue Airways have never offered bereavement fares. ""Offering bereavement or emergency fares would make it necessary to offset these discounts by charging higher ticket prices and reducing the amount of sale fares we currently offer,"" Southwest spokesman Dan Landson said. Southwest doesn't charge fees to change an existing reservation, just the price difference between the current and new tickets, Landson said. Cheaper online fares can be found . Frequent travelers know that better fares can usually be found online for last-minute emergency travel, according to travel blogger Johnny ""Jet"" DiScala. That's why he said the change won't have much of an impact. ""It does make the airlines look heartless,"" DiScala said. ""I've known people who didn't travel to a loved one's funeral because they couldn't afford the last-minute ticket."" Consumers Union aviation consultant William McGee, who testified before Congress last year on the potential impact of the USAirways-American merger, said he isn't surprised by the policy change. ""It's a natural outgrowth of a shrinking industry since consolidation leads to fewer choices, higher fares, and less service,"" McGee wrote via e-mail. ""Unfortunately, consumers should expect this trend to continue as the domestic airline industry rapidly consolidates through mergers and acquisitions."" Disney's Magic Kingdom raises prices . Discounts at United, Delta . Still, Delta and United remain holdouts. Delta's bereavement policy, which ""offers additional flexibility on the best published fare,"" lists the documentation required and the types of relatives who qualify on its website. The airline reminds customers that lower promotional fares may be available through its website or airline reservations service. United offers a 5% discount on one-way and round-trip fares in the event of the death or serious illness (requiring hospitalization or hospice care) of an immediate family member. Its website lists the airline's requirements to qualify for the airfare. Five percent off a $1,000 ticket still isn't much -- $50 -- so it's possible that consumers would still be better off searching online for the best deals. But even with such a small benefit as United's, maybe it's the thought that airlines recognize their grieving customers that counts. CNN first learned about this story via Twitter.

"Amid mounting allegations against him, Bill Cosby has broken his silence. Well, sort of. Cosby, accused of rape and other misdeeds by an increasing number of women, was reached at home on Friday by a freelance reporter for the New York Post. While Cosby offered Stacy Brown more than the head-shake that caused several moments of awkward radio silence during an interview with NPR, he did not address the allegations. Instead, he offered his expectations for how the media -- specifically, ""the black media"" -- should cover the story. ""Let me say this,"" the 77-year-old said. ""I only expect the black media to uphold the standards of excellence in journalism and when you do that, you have to go in with a neutral mind."" Model Beverly Johnson says Bill Cosby drugged her . Cosby's reputation has suffered in the wake of the allegations. On Monday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Spelman College, to which Cosby and wife Camille donated $20 million in 1987, has suspended the Cosby Chair for the Humanities while the controversy continues. ""The William and Camille Olivia Hanks Cosby Endowed Professorship was established to bring positive attention and accomplished visiting scholars to Spelman College in order to enhance our intellectual, cultural and creative life,"" a school spokeswoman told the newspaper. ""The current context prevents us from continuing to meet these objectives fully. Consequently, we will suspend the program until such time that the original goals can again be met."" Cosby himself cut ties with his beloved Temple University, where he served on the board, two weeks ago. Cosby attended Temple in the early '60s. Despite Cosby's challenges, Brown wrote that the comedian ""sounded upbeat on the phone,"" especially when it came to a question about how his wife, Camille, is holding up. ""Love and the strength of womanhood,"" Cosby said. ""Let me say it again, love and the strength of womanhood. And, you could reverse it, the strength of womanhood and love."" The actor then resumed his public relations posture of late and ended the conversation, saying, ""They don't want me talking to the media."" Brown also writes for the Washington Informer, a newspaper targeted to the African-American community, and he spoke with CNN about their conversation. Brown said he came away with the clear sense that Cosby actually doesn't want to stay silent at all but is nevertheless deferring to the guidance of his representatives for the time being. ""I definitely came away with the belief that he wants to talk about everything,"" Brown said. ""He seemed as if he really does have a lot to say and, oddly enough, he didn't in any way appear worried about anything. To me, he sounded like a happy individual without a care in the world."" As for how he sort of landed a sort of scoop, Brown said he had been keeping in touch with Cosby's camp for the past three and a half weeks -- and at one point even thought he was close to securing an interview -- but when his people changed their minds, Brown did an end-around.

"There has never been any doubt that President Obama fully accepts the Supreme Court's authority to render a definitive ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Chief executives during our history, including President Andrew Jackson in the 1830s and President Harry Truman in the 1940s, have in fact challenged or threatened to challenge the court's right to command obedience to its understanding of the Constitution, but Obama certainly is not among them. As a brilliant constitutional lawyer deeply devoted to the rule of law, he has nothing but respect for the critical function that judicial review performs in preserving the American system of constitutional government.  Efforts to divine a contrary theory in his remarks were strained at the outset and have grown only more untenable. The ""unprecedented, extraordinary"" step he noted the justices would be taking if they were to overturn the Affordable Care Act was, of course, not the step of exercising judicial review, as the court has done ever since Marbury v. Madison in 1803, but the step of second-guessing congressional judgments about how best to regulate a vast segment of the national economy. No one in the world -- certainly none of the justices -- can have been surprised to learn that Obama believes his signature domestic achievement fully complies with the Constitution and ought to be upheld -- or that the Supreme Court has a decades-old tradition of treading lightly when major regulations of interstate commerce come before it. After the president made that entirely clear Tuesday, some suggested that it would be best for presidents not to comment on cases pending before the Supreme Court even while the rest of the nation continues to debate the underlying constitutional issues. I was among those who took that view while others suggested that, as the entire nation continues to discuss the constitutionality of a vital economic measure, artificially muzzling the nation's chief executive ill serves the purposes of open public debate on important issues. That's something about which people can reasonably differ. But there's no reasonable basis for seeing in the president's comments either a challenge to the court's authority as an independent branch of government or a clumsy attempt to pressure it politically or to influence its deliberations. This president knows as well as anyone how utterly implausible it would be to think that the justices might be swayed in their constitutional views by his brief remarks, which did little more than reiterate a core theme of the government's legal briefs (namely, the critical importance of strong judicial deference to the elected branches on complex matters of economic regulation like national health care policy).  This theme has received a full airing in media commentary, congressional hearings, legal scholarship and lower court judicial opinions.  Nobody could really believe that the president's candid expression of a view that everyone already attributed to him would move the judicial calculus even a micrometer. The justices have spent months steeped in more than a hundred legal briefs, presided over one of the most dramatic oral arguments of the past century and are currently engaged in robust internal deliberations.  They also live in a world awash with op-eds, heated commentary and all the markers of fiercely divided public opinion.  These are men and women accustomed to dealing with politics.  They ordinarily approach their duties with the utmost seriousness and, we must hope, are exercising their very highest faculties of judgecraft and constitutional commitment in this case. There was no disrespect in the president's entirely correct observation that precedent and historical practice alike would lead a suitably cautious court to uphold rather than overturn his signature first-term achievement in providing health insurance to millions of Americans. The fact that health care reform has represented a pressing issue for the nation over the course of a century would indeed make a decision to strike down the law all the more jarring. But the notion that the president's recognition of that fact somehow crossed the Rubicon in our separation of powers by seeking to diminish the court's independence is patently absurd. That said, we have recently witnessed a shocking misuse of power in relation to these events.  But it came from the judiciary rather than the president.  Judge Jerry Smith of the 5th Circuit responded to the president's comments by ordering the Department of Justice to submit a three-page, single-spaced memo stating the administration's position on judicial authority to invalidate unconstitutional laws.  Attorney General Eric Holder filed that memo Thursday, reiterating the plain import of the president's remarks and stating that ""the power of the courts to review the constitutionality of legislation is beyond dispute."" Smith's gratuitous order is little more than a thinly concealed insult to the president, the Justice Department and the administration.  It constitutes a shocking departure from norms of judicial behavior.  While such partisan bickering might be expected from the minority leader of the Senate or from commentators like Rush Limbaugh, who drew upon Obama's remarks in yet another entry in their relentless attacks on the president, it is hardly to be expected of a federal judge. As constitutional challenges to the Affordable Care Act have journeyed through the courts since the statute's 2010 passage, the country has engaged in a profound national conversation about the Constitution's import and meaning.  Although I remain unpersuaded by constitutional objections to the statute, I respect the efforts of many Americans to give voice to their convictions in constitutional terms.  This week's distortion and exaggeration only tarnish the earnestness of such efforts and threaten to undermine the genuine opportunities for constitutional dialogue and disagreement that sustain us as a nation.","Obama's remarks about ""judicial activism"" have received a wide range of reactions .

"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry waded into the thicket of Mideast politics Friday, chiding the Turkish prime minister for a slam on Zionism while touting the ties the United States has with Turkey and Israel -- two once friendly nations now mired in antipathy. Kerry said he and the Obama administration disagreed with Recep Tayyip Erdogan's remark equating Zionism with crimes against humanity, and he called it ""objectionable."" He appeared to be making a reference to the remark in his praise of Mustafa Akarsu, the Turkish guard at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara who died in a February 1 suicide attack. ""Mustafa's tragic death reminds all of us of the common bond we share,"" Kerry told reporters in a joint news conference in Ankara with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. It ""underscores the urgent need to promote a spirit of tolerance that includes all of the public statements made by all leaders."" Kerry said he mentioned Erdogan's speech to the foreign minister and plans to broach it with Erdogan. ""That said, Turkey and Israel are both vital allies,"" Kerry said. ""We want to see them work together to go beyond rhetoric and take concrete steps to change their relationship. I believe it's possible."" The remarks overshadowed the key crisis in the region: the Syrian civil war. Kerry said the United States and Turkey share opposition to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. He said that Turkey and the United States believe in a political solution in Syria and that both countries have worked to bring about tough sanctions to reduce money flowing to the Assad government. He cited the Patriot missiles placed on Turkey's border with Syria for security and the country's hosting of tens of thousands of Syrian refugees. ""Minister Davutoglu and I believe there is no legitimacy in a regime that creates atrocities against its own people,"" Kerry said. Kerry attended a memorial service for the security guard killed at the embassy last month and described him as a ""courageous Turk."" The United States, he said, ""stands strongly with Turkey, our NATO ally in the fight against terrorism."" The embassy was attacked last month by a man Turkish authorities say belonged to the Marxist Leninist organization known as the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party, or DHKP-C, which the U.S. government and others label a terrorist organization. As for Erdogan's remarks, a senior State Department official earlier said the comment was ""particularly offensive"" and ""complicates our ability to do all the things we want to do together when we have such a profound disagreement about such an important thing,"" Erdogan appeared at the U.N. Alliance of Civilizations, which works to defuse tensions and promote cooperation between the Muslim and Western worlds. ""It is necessary that we must consider -- just like Zionism, or anti-Semitism, or fascism -- Islamophobia as a crime against humanity,"" the Turkish prime minister said. Zionism is the Jewish national liberation movement that led to Israel's founding and is the nation's underpinning. Erdogan's remarks drew a quick rebuke from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But many in the Muslim world harbor notions like Erdogan's about the movement. ""This is a dark and mendacious statement, the likes of which we thought had passed from the world,"" Netanyahu said. Israel and Turkey are major U.S. allies in the Middle East. But the once extensive cooperation between Turkey and Israel on trade, tourism and military issues has broken down. Turkey, a NATO member, has been affected by one of the world's most volatile conflicts -- the Syrian civil war -- and has been a staunch opponent of the Assad regime. Israel has been a longtime friend of the United States and is seen as a pro-U.S. bulwark in the region. The falling out between Turkey and Israel was hastened by the Israeli commando attack on a ship in a Gaza-bound flotilla three years ago. Turkey has called for an apology for the incident, which resulted in the deaths of eight Turks and one American of Turkish origin.

"The blame game over ""The Interview"" is intensifying. At the heart of the widening controversy are North Korea's role in the devastating cyberattack on Sony Pictures and the studio's decision to pull the film amid threats against moviegoers. The crisis has rippled out into international relations, business plans, Hollywood gossip and party politics. The different sides kept up their sparring over the weekend, with President Barack Obama accusing North Korea of ""cybervandalism"" and Pyongyang claiming that the U.S. government was behind the making of the movie. Here's the lowdown on who's saying what: . North Korea . North Korea's rage over the Seth Rogen film about a plot to assassinate its leader, Kim Jong Un, continues to boil. After the FBI's assertions that North Korea was responsible for a hack into Sony's computer systems, Kim's regime is still steadfastly denying involvement. On Saturday, it said the U.S. accusations were ""an attempt to frame us for this crime"" and suggested the two countries work together to investigate the hacking. But by Sunday, it was making less conciliatory noises, offering the bizarre claim that it had ""clear evidence that the U.S. administration was deeply involved in the making of such dishonest reactionary movie."" North Korea also stepped up its threatening rhetoric, warning the United States that it is targeting its ""citadels."" ""Our toughest counteraction will be boldly taken against the White House, the Pentagon and the whole U.S. mainland, the cesspool of terrorism,"" the statement carried by North Korean state media said. President Obama . The U.S. President told CNN on Sunday that the hack was ""an act of cybervandalism that was very costly, very expensive"" but that he doesn't consider it an act of war. Obama said in the interview that the United States is going review whether to put North Korea back on a list of states that sponsor terrorism. The President had previously said at a news conference Friday that the United States will ""respond proportionally"" to the attack on Sony without giving specifics. Obama has also chided Sony for its actions, saying he that thinks the studio made ""a mistake"" in pulling the movie and that he wished the company had called him first. He expressed concerns to CNN's Candy Crowley on Sunday about the broader implications of pulling ""The Interview."" ""If we set a precedent in which a dictator in another country can disrupt through cyber, a company's distribution chain or its products, and as a consequence we start censoring ourselves, that's a problem,"" Obama said. Sony . Sony Entertainment Chief Executive Michael Lynton has defended the company's actions, denying that the studio had ""caved"" by scrapping the planned release of ""The Interview"" in theaters. He told CNN that Obama and the public ""are mistaken as to what actually happened."" In an interview with Fareed Zakaria that aired Sunday, he blamed movie theater companies that opted not to show the film, saying they forced Sony's hand. ""We do not own movie theaters,"" Lynton said. ""We cannot determine whether or not a movie will be played in movie theaters."" He also opened the door to a future release of the controversial comedy, saying the company is considering some sort of release on the Internet. ""We have always have had every desire to have the American public see this movie,"" Lynton said. In a statement released Sunday, the company said: ""No decisions have been made. Sony is still exploring options for distribution."" The hackers . On Saturday, the Guardians of Peace, the group of hackers who claim responsibility for the cyberattack on Sony, mocked the FBI in a new statement. ""The result of investigation by FBI is so excellent that you might have seen what we were doing with your own eye,"" said the statement posted on the file-sharing website pastebin. ""We congratulate you (sic) success. FBI is the BEST in the world. You will find the gift for FBI at the following address. Enjoy!"" The link provided in the message leads to a YouTube video titled ""You Are An Idiot."" The FBI investigation linked the malware, infrastructure and techniques used by the Guardians of Peace in the Sony hack to previous North Korean cyberattacks. In its comments Sunday, North Korea said that ""fighters for justice"" including the Guardians of Peace ""are sharpening bayonets not only in the U.S. mainland but in all other parts of the world."" China . North Korea's closest ally has so far been staying out of the fray. But a senior Obama administration official told CNN on Saturday that United States has asked China for help battling North Korean hacking. North Korea's Internet traffic goes through China. Obama has said there's no indication that North Korea ""was acting in conjunction with another country."" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke by phone with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday night, China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on its website Monday. Wang stressed that China opposes all forms of cyberattacks and cyberterrorism, the statement said, omitting any mention of North Korea. U.S. Republicans . In Washington, Republican Sen. John McCain criticized Obama's response to the Sony hacking. He rejected Obama's characterization of the North Korean hack as ""an act of cybervandelism,"" instead calling it ""a new form of warfare"" on CNN's State of the Union. The President does not understand that this is a manifestation of a new form of warfare when you destroy economies, when you are able to impose censorship,"" McCain, a Republican from Arizona, said. ""It's more than vandalism. It's a new form of warfare that we're involved in and we need to react and we need to react vigorously."" The Republican National Committee urged cinema chains to show the movie. In a letter to their CEOs, RNC chairman Reince Priebus wrote: ""As a sign of my commitment, if you agree to show this movie, I will send a note to the Republican Party's millions of donors and supporters urging them to buy a ticket -- not to support one movie or Hollywood, but to show North Korea we cannot be bullied into giving up our freedom.""","North Korea claims the U.S. government involved in making ""The Interview""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- For the first time since September 11, 2001, America is having a vigorous national debate about how to succeed in Afghanistan. This debate is entirely worth having. Whenever America sends its citizens into harm's way, it must do so with eyes wide open. Though no veteran would ever think of himself as ""pro-war,"" I believe that the fight in Afghanistan is critical to our national security. Our goals there are achievable and success is worth the continued sacrifice. We must succeed in Afghanistan for many reasons, but one stands above all: the world walked away from Afghanistan once, and it descended into a cauldron of violence, hatred and human rights atrocities that served as the base for the worst terrorist attack in history against our homeland. We cannot let that happen again, and we cannot let the Taliban and its al Qaeda allies conquer Afghanistan once more. Failure of this kind would also destabilize the entire strategically vital region, including nuclear-armed Pakistan. We know what it takes to succeed in Afghanistan: a resolute commitment to the principles of counterinsurgency, which turned Iraq around during the surge. I am confident that properly resourced counterinsurgency policy, adapted to the unique culture and geography of Afghanistan, can lead to success there. Our entire military chain of command supports this approach, as do our NATO allies, which they made clear at their recent defense ministerial meeting in Bratislava. I supported President Obama when he called for a counterinsurgency plan in March, and I did so again when he deployed Gen. Stanley McChrystal to lead the command in Kabul. I agree with our commander's assessment of the security situation as ""deteriorating"" and that our civilian and military leaders urgently need more resources, including more combat troops, to turn the tide toward success. I sympathize with our president, because sending men and women into harm's way is the most difficult decision that a commander-in-chief must make. However, Americans are already serving in harm's way in Afghanistan, and the sooner we can provide the reinforcements and resources they need, the safer and more successful they will be. So I am urging President Obama to move as quickly as possible to fully support Gen. McChrystal's request for more troops. It is true that the Afghan government is not as strong or credible as we would like, but that should not deter us from committing more civilian and military resources now. Local governments in counterinsurgency environments are usually weak and fledgling. There is an insurgency in the first place because it seeks to exploit the local population's dissatisfaction with its government. As long as Afghanistan is insecure, it is unreasonable to assume that governance will improve. That is why protecting the population must be job one right now, and in the immediate term, much of that work must be done by U.S. and NATO troops. As security improves, however, we will be able to train capable, battle-tested Afghan security forces that can defend their country. We can break the insurgency's momentum, enabling Afghans to reconcile with former fighters who are willing to lay down their arms. And we can create an environment of safety in which it is more realistic to expect Afghan leaders to meet the high standards of their fellow citizens and their international partners -- namely, the provision of justice and opportunity, the protection of human rights and a crackdown on corruption. Ultimately, Afghans will judge the legitimacy of their government not only by the result of one round of voting, but by its performance in delivering basic services. Success in Afghanistan will emerge, as it did in Iraq, when local leaders and citizens are more and more able to take responsibility for governing and securing their own sovereign country without substantial international assistance. This won't be perfect or easy, but it will allow America's fighting men and women to leave Afghanistan with honor, and it will enable Afghans to build a better, more peaceful future. That is our goal, and we must stay in the fight until it is won. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John McCain.","Sen.

"Is it a slow leak that will grow into a cascade, or a minor drip easily plugged? More and more, conservative Republicans in Congress are breaking from a pledge they signed years earlier against any kind of tax increase or additional tax revenue. Facing the so-called fiscal cliff of automatic tax hikes and deep across-the-board spending cuts at the end of the year, the GOP legislators are signaling their willingness to cut a deal with President Barack Obama and Democrats that would include more money for the government. Poll: Lawmakers won't act their age on fiscal cliff . The overall numbers remain relatively small -- a handful of senators and House members -- but they include influential veterans such as Sens. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, along with Rep. Peter King of New York. King has ""tried to weasel out"" of the pledge, anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist told CNN's Piers Morgan on Monday. ""I hope his wife understands commitments last a little longer than two years or something."" Norquist said King knew when he signed it that he was pledging that ""as long as you're in Congress, you will rein in spending and reform government, not raise taxes. It's not for 500 years or two generations. It's only as long as you're in the House or the Senate. If he stayed too long, that's his problem."" iReport: Share your financial compromise stories . On Sunday,  Graham declared on ABC, ""We don't generate enough revenue,"" officially disagreeing with the Taxpayer Protection Pledge he signed at Norquist's behest. Others who have rejected the strict dogma of the Norquist pledge include Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Bob Corker of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia, who was elected in the tea party wave of 2010 and recently re-elected. Norquist, who founded the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, advocates shrinking government by cutting spending instead of raising taxes through higher rates or reforms. He sounded unconcerned Monday about the GOP backlash, telling CNN that ""no pledge taker has voted for a tax increase."" ""You've had some people discussing impure thoughts on national television,"" Norquist said. Norquist: I'll unseat pledge breakers . At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters he hoped the ""welcome"" comments by some Republicans represented ""a difference in tone and approach to these problems."" To CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger, the softening tone by some in the GOP was explained by new poll numbers that showed 45% of Americans would blame Republicans for failing to avoid the fiscal cliff, while 34% would blame Obama. The public shift comes after Obama won re-election and Democrats increased their slim Senate majority and narrowed the GOP majority in the House in this month's election. In what have been secret talks so far, Obama and Congress are seeking to revive a possible ""grand bargain"" to cut the chronic federal deficits and debt. Without a deal, tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 -- when George W. Bush was president -- will expire, raising rates for everyone starting in January. In addition, spending cuts would reduce spending on the military, national parks, the Federal Aviation Administration and other important government services. However, the government and Congress still would have time to prevent draconian effects from the fiscal cliff when a new Congress convenes in January. Obama promotes his fiscal cliff solution . William Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, called that a form of brinksmanship best avoided. ""To be sure, no one believes that non-agreement by December 31 would be the end of the story. After a period of finger-pointing, discussions would resume,"" he wrote last week in a New Republic opinion piece. ""But equally, no one knows how the failure to reach agreement before the end of 2012 would affect the dynamics of the negotiations."" In addition, ""we can be reasonably sure ... that national and global markets would react adversely and that businesses, which are already retreating from planned investments in new plant and equipment, would become even more uncertain and risk-averse."" The CNN/ORC International poll released Monday also showed that a solid majority of respondents -- two-thirds -- supports the Democratic stance that any agreement should include a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. Of that total, Republicans favor such an approach by 52%-44%. In particular, Obama and Democrats insist that wealthy Americans, so far identified as those with income higher than $200,000 for individuals or $250,000 for families, should pay more taxes than they do now so that rates for everyone else stay the same. However, the outgoing Congress in a lame-duck session for the rest of the year, as well as the new Congress to be seated in January, include large numbers of Republicans who signed the Norquist pledge. Come January, there will be 39 senators, including Chambliss and Graham, and 219 House members who endorsed it. Trending: Graham says he'd break no-tax 'pledge' The House total constitutes a narrow majority in the 435-seat chamber, though some members have denounced their allegiance to the pledge. Some congressional conservatives sought to deflect attention from the Norquist pledge on Monday, focusing instead on the need to work out a deal that included concessions by Democrats. ""The goal is to solve the problem,"" insisted Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the No. 3 House Republican in the incoming Congress. He rejected Obama's call for letting tax rates on income over $250,000 return to higher levels of the 1990s, telling CNN ""that doesn't solve the problem"" because ""you do nothing about the growth of government."" Long a defining difference between Democrats and Republicans, the tax issue has stymied efforts to work out a deficit deal for the past two years. Obama and House Speaker John Boehner came close to agreement last year before conservative rejection of any increased revenue and liberal resistance to entitlement reform scuttled the effort. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who has emerged as party leader in the deficit talks, agrees to the concept of increased revenue, though he and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky both remain opposed to actually raising tax rates. Instead, they propose broad tax reform that will lower rates while eliminating unspecified loopholes and exemptions to spur economic growth that they say will result in more overall government revenue. ""It's fair to ask my party to put revenue on the table. We're below historic averages,"" Graham told ABC. ""I will not raise tax rates to do it. I will cap deductions. If you cap deductions around the $30,000, $40,000 range, you can raise $1 trillion in revenue, and the people who lose their deductions are the upper-income Americans."" At the same time, Graham and other conservative lawmakers demand that Democrats agree to significant reforms in entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, the government-run health care programs for senior citizens, the disabled and the poor. ""I will violate the pledge, long story short, for the good of the country, only if Democrats will do entitlement reform,"" Graham said. On the same program, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois said some changes to Medicare are needed, but he ruled out any reforms to Social Security, the national retirement plan, saying it is a separately funded system that ""does not add a penny to our debt."" Noting opposition to entitlement reforms by traditional Democratic allies such as organized labor, Durbin said everyone has to realize that some changes are needed in Medicare and Medicaid. Fiscal cliff tax deal: Getting to $1 trillion . ""Those who say 'don't touch it, don't change it' are ignoring the obvious,"" said the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, adding that ""we can make meaningful reforms in Medicare and Medicaid without compromising the integrity of the program, making sure that the beneficiaries are not paying the price for it, except perhaps the high-income beneficiaries. That to me is a reasonable approach."" However, Durbin balked at one proposal sought by Republicans -- to slowly raise the eligibility age for Medicare above the current level of 65. ""What happens to the early retiree who needs health insurance before that person's eligible for Medicare?"" Durbin asked. ""My concern about raising that Medicare retirement age is there will be gaps in coverage or coverage that's way too expensive for seniors to purchase."" Graham rejected Durbin's point, saying the same change instituted in Social Security has worked. He also called for adjusting benefits based on the personal wealth of recipients, so that those with more money have to pay more for services. Norquist said Democrats will never agree to the negotiating position of Graham and other Republicans, calling the demand for entitlement reforms akin to a ""pink unicorn that doesn't exist.""

The political risk for Republicans to going against the no-tax pledge comes from angering Norquist and other conservatives who can target them in GOP primary campaigns in 2014 and beyond. Norquist said Monday his group would ""certainly highlight who has kept their commitment and who hasn't"" when re-election time comes. ""The key here is whether or not the Republicans will move away from the ideologically rigid position, which has been the Grover Norquist pledge,"" Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan told NBC on Sunday. ""You've got to raise additional revenues, including tax rates on the wealthy. They have to go up.

"The Department of Veterans Affairs misled Congress and members of the media about how many veterans died or suffered serious harm as a result of extreme treatment delays, according to a new report by the department's top watchdog. The VA shared a fact sheet in April with Congress and the press that said 23 veterans died and a total of 76 suffered serious harm throughout the nation while waiting months or years for health care since 1999. But the report released Monday by the VA's Office of Inspector General highlights multiple errors with these findings and a lack of evidence for statements the VA released about them. Amongst the misleading facts highlighted in the report, the VA overstated the timeframe of its review by eight years, since the VA said it examined unresolved requests for health care since 1999, but in reality only examined requests dating back to 2007. Moreover, the inspector general says there may have been ""overstatements or understatements"" about the number of deaths or illnesses resulting from delays at specific VA hospitals and that the fact sheet contained a number of other errors. These errors also included an incident reported to have occurred at one VA facility when it actually happened at another, and the number of ""institutional disclosures"" -- where the VA admitted delays caused severe harm -- as being overstated at one facility. The report raises questions about how many veterans may have had their appointments erased by VA staff before they received treatment. The VA reported that between September 2012 and April 2014, the number of appointments delayed more than 90 days dropped from 2 million to less than 300,000, but the inspector general found that the VA did not document how staff members were closing these appointments and did not ensure veterans received the care they were waiting for. As a result, the inspector general could not determine what happened to 1.7 million appointments. VA leaders, including a top VA health official, Dr. Thomas Lynch, shared many of these statistics on patient deaths and harm during a congressional staff briefing on April 7 and repeated them at a House Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing on April 9. Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Florida, the committee chairman, described the errors as either intentionally deceitful or grossly incompetent. ""VA's statistics regarding the number of veterans harmed by department delays in care are almost certainly wildly inaccurate and we may never know the actual number of veterans affected by gaps in the VA system that existed for years,"" Miller said in a statement Monday. ""Accountability for the VA leaders responsible for misleading Congress and the public on this important matter is sorely needed,"" he added. Miller also said the VA eventually contradicted itself in correspondence with the House committee by saying a review of delayed requests for health care dating back to 1999 would not be possible. The VA previously issued an apology for the misleading and incorrect statements saying, ""VA inadvertently caused confusion in its communication on this complex set of reviews that were ongoing at the time. For that, we apologize. There was no intent to mislead anyone with respect to the scope or findings of these reviews."" A separate VA audit released in June found that about 57,000 newly enrolled veterans were waiting at least 90 days for medical care and that almost 64,000 who enrolled in the past decade requested, but never received, appointments. VA Secretary Robert McDonald has since taken steps to reform the embattled agency by creating new partnerships with private organizations, giving veterans greater access to private health care and establishing a VA-wide customer service office, among other programs.","A new report says the Department of Veterans Affairs misled Congress and the public .

"Two deadly attacks in two days in the city of Volgograd have once again raised the specter of terrorism in Russia, just weeks before the country is due to hold the 2014 Winter Olympics. At least 16 people were killed Monday when an explosion hit a trolleybus during the morning rush hour. Less than 24 hours earlier, a blast at Volgograd's main train station killed 18 people. Authorities quickly labeled both acts terrorist attacks. And while no group immediately claimed responsibility, suspicion quickly fell on Chechen separatist groups. One in particular, the Caucasus Emirate, has said it will expend ""maximum force"" in disrupting the Olympic games in Sochi. Here's a look at the ongoing conflict in Russia's North Caucasus region, at how the violence has spilled over into the rest of the country, and why Volgograd may have been targeted. Second blast rocks Russian city . Q. Who is behind the attack? A. That's hard to say since no group has yet stepped forward. While the Caucasus Emirate has made incendiary statements vowing attacks, the explosions could be the work of any number of autonomous groups fighting in the North Caucasus region. Then again, they could also be the handiwork of another group altogether, one that has nothing to do with the conflict in the region. Q. Why has suspicion fallen on the Caucasus Emirate? A. In July, Doku Umarov, the group's leader, released a video statement in which he vowed to unleash ""maximum force"" to disrupt the games at Sochi. The Russians, he said, "" plan to hold the Olympics on the bones of our ancestors, on the bones of many, many dead Muslims buried on the territory of our land on the Black Sea, and we Mujahedeen are obliged not to permit that -- using any methods allowed us by the almighty Allah."" Q. Why were Umarov's threats taken seriously? A. Because Umarov is Russia's most-wanted man. The U.S. State Department, which considers the Caucasus Emirate a terrorist group, has a $5 million reward for information leading to him. The State Department said Umarov organized a suicide bombing outside the Chechen Interior Ministry in May 2009. His group also claimed responsibility for the bombing of Domodedovo Airport in Moscow in 2011 that killed 36 people, the 2010 bombings of the Moscow subway that killed 40 people, and the 2009 bombing of the high-speed Nevsky Express train in which 28 people died. Q. How did Russian authorities react? A. Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained that the Sochi games will be safe and security will be tight. Visitors to Sochi and the surrounding area are subjected to rigorous security checks, and vehicle license plates are monitored. Chechnya's leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, vowed that the threat Umarov poses will be contained before the start of the games. ""He is Satan. I am certain that we will eliminate him before the Olympics,"" Kadyrov said after Umarov's statement. But the Volgograd attacks have laid bare the challenge in ensuring the safety throughout the massive country. Q. Why was Volgograd targeted? A. One reason could be because Volgograd is a major rail hub. If you are traveling from Moscow or other parts of central Russia, you travel through Volgograd to get to Sochi. It's also the rail station you travel through to get to and from the North Caucasus. Opinion: Attacks show Sochi Olympics under grave threat . Q. What is the North Caucasus region? A. It's a region that comprises the Russian republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria and North Ossetia. And it's a part of the world that's no stranger to violence and terrorism. Q. What is the source of the conflict? A. The conflict dates back many years and has exacted a heavy toll on both sides. Chechens have laid claim to land in the Caucasus Mountains region for more than 5,000 years. The standard of living in the republics is poor compared with the rest of Russia. Unemployment is rampant and infant mortality is high. In addition, the Chechen population of about 1 million is mostly made up of Sunni Muslims, who maintain a distinctly different cultural and linguistic identity from Russian Orthodox Christians. In 1991, Chechnya formally announced its fight for independence, saying it never joined Russia voluntarily. Q. What happened next? A. Initially, the Russian government did not take the pronouncement seriously. But after a series of rebel attacks, then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent in 40,000 Russian troops in 1994 to quash the insurgency. Two years later, the forces withdrew after heavy losses on both sides. Russia and Chechnya declared a ceasefire.  And though Russia still claimed it as part of its federation, the region was allowed to operate with substantial autonomy.  But the peace didn't last. Q. Why didn't the ceasefire hold? A. Hardline rebels continued to launch attacks. And many of the deadliest took place in other parts of Russia. In September 1999, for example, rebels bombed apartment buildings in Moscow and the southern cities of Buynaksk and Volgodonsk. Nearly 300 people died. Q. What did Russia do next? A. Then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin vowed to crack down on the insurgency by sending in troops, a promise that partly ensured his election as president the following year. A second war followed from 1999 to 2009, killing an estimated 15,000 Russian soldiers and 300,000 Chechens. More than one-third of Chechenya's residents were displaced and the region's infrastructure was reduced to ruins. The United Nations in 2002 named Chechnya's capital, Grozny, ""the most destroyed city on the planet."" Human rights groups said Moscow disregarded or suspended civil rights in its fight against terrorism, including committing illegal killings. For their part, Chechen rebels also horrified the world with high-profile attacks targeting civilians. Q. What were some of the deadliest attacks? A. Chechen fighters held 700 theater-goers hostage in a Moscow theater in 2002. A Russian effort to free them resulted in the deaths of 120 hostages. Chechen rebels were also accused of downing two Russian airplanes in 2004. And they took over a school in Beslan in the North Ossetia region in 2004. When the siege ended, more than 330 people had died, half of them children. Just as Putin proclaimed that his policies were succeeding in Chechnya, the pro-Moscow president of the region and 20 others were killed by a bomb that went off under a stadium grandstand in 2004. But by 2009, Russia had quashed the rebel movement to the point that it officially declared the war over. Q. What is the situation in the region today? A. Violence in Chechnya has ebbed, particularly following the death of Islamist militant Shamil Basayev in July 2006 in neighboring Ingushetia. Kadyrov, a former rebel, is president of a pro-Moscow Chechen government. Rights groups say he rules with an iron fist and little regard for law. Q. What about the insurgency? A. The insurgency itself has not so much ended as it has moved to the east and the west -- to the republics of Dagestan and Ingushetia, where rebels are fighting troops to destabilize the region. It has also attracted foreign Islamist militants ready to fight for the cause. ""Chechnya's long and violent guerrilla war has attracted a small number of Islamist militants from outside of Chechnya -- some of whom are Arab fighters with possible links to al Qaeda,"" the Council on Foreign Relations said. An International Crisis Group report published in October 2012 warned that continued ethnic, religious, political and economic grievances could bring increased tensions in the North Caucasus region. ""The killing is unlikely to end soon,"" it said. Q. Wasn't there mention of the conflict during the Boston Marathon bombing coverage? A. Yes, the insurgency in the region made news after the deadly bombing at the Boston Marathon earlier this year. The suspects, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, were born in Kyrgyzstan but were ethnic Chechens. Kadyrov distanced his republic from the brothers in Boston, saying, ""They grew up in the U.S. and their views and beliefs were formulated there. So you need to look for the roots of the evil in America."" Russia's Putin visits victims of Volgograd blasts .","After two bombings in Volgograd, suspicion has fallen on the North Caucasus .

"It breaks my heart to read about the death of James Boyd, a homeless man shot and killed by Albuquerque police in March. Boyd was apparently mentally ill. His death recalls the January shooting of Keith Vidal, the North Carolina teenager who, his family says, suffered from schizophrenia and who was shot and killed after police arrived to help with a crisis. Many details of that case are still unclear, and it's hard to know who or what is responsible. Tragically, incidents such as this appear over and over again in the news. The scenario goes something like this: Police are called to assist with a person who is experiencing a mental health crisis. There is an escalation in tensions, perhaps the introduction of a real or imagined threat, and this leads to someone getting hurt or, worse, killed. And it's not always the person in crisis; sometimes, it is the police officer. Another all-too-common outcome is that the person in crisis ends up not at the hospital but at the jail. Police officers, families and certainly people with mental health conditions don't want this to happen.  And it doesn't have to. There is a time-tested, well-researched way to lessen the likelihood that calling the police for assistance will end badly. In 1988, an approach was developed in Memphis that has been slowly -- too slowly -- making its way throughout the country. It's called Crisis Intervention Team Training, usually just referred to as CIT. Here's how CIT works:  A team of police officers (or other first responders) from one department or jurisdiction, or from a coalition of neighboring departments, undergoes a comprehensive week-long (40-hour) training program that does several things. It teaches some basics about mental illnesses, substance abuse disorders and developmental disabilities, and it explains how to recognize and interact with someone with these conditions who is in crisis. News reports indicate that the detective who was put on administrative leave after the Keith Vidal shooting had not completed the CIT program, though others in the Southport Police Department, where he served, had.  If true, we can't know whether this would have changed the outcome, but it most certainly could have helped. A cadre of community experts provides the training. They include fellow police officers, mental health professionals, family members and people who live with mental health conditions. In addition to clinical information and learning about community resources (and how to link to them), trainees hear personal stories, acquire de-escalation skills and put knowledge into practice through role play. Officers and people who have had their own crises act out a number of no-holds-barred, real-life scenarios. They also get a sense of what it's like to experience extreme mental health symptoms, such as hearing voices.  It's not always pretty to watch or listen to, but the outcomes of the CIT training show great promise. Research shows that when CIT trained officers respond to a call, there are myriad benefits. The use of physical restraints goes way down, as do injuries to people in crisis and to officers. People are less likely to be arrested and taken to jail. And because officers know how to connect people to community services, the need to use the most expensive emergency services can sometimes be avoided. Equally valuable is the goodwill that CIT engenders. Officers report greater satisfaction in knowing how to help people, and citizens report greater trust in their police. If cities as large as Philadelphia and Houston and rural communities such as New River Valley in Virginia and Cambria County, Pennsylvania, can institute CIT, why aren't there teams in every community? Of course, it costs money to pull officers off the street, to train police dispatchers, to pay for materials and for costs associated with using community buildings. Grants from government entities and foundations can at times help to offset these costs.  And much of the training is done by volunteers. While the basics of the training program remain the same, it must be tailored to each locality. Therefore, more than anything else instituting a CIT program takes commitment and coordination. This usually begins with a person, or small group of people, building a coalition of community stakeholders.  How many fewer tragedies might there be if more people stepped forward to become CIT champions?

"The Baltimore Ravens' top security guy has been charged with a sex offense that allegedly occurred December 14, online court records reveal. The senior security director for the NFL team, Darren Sanders, was charged with a fourth-degree sex offense which is ""not considered a sexually violent offense but sexual contact without consent of victim,"" according to the Maryland Attorney General's office definition. The record did not go into details about the charges but the address listed for the defendant is that of the team's headquarters in Owings Mills, Maryland. CNN was unable to reach Sanders' lawyer. But the lawyer, Andrew Alperstein, told the Baltimore Sun the charges were ""totally fabricated."" Earlier this year, Sanders was mired in the infamous Ray Rice elevator beating scandal in which the football player was investigated for hitting his then-fiancée in an elevator of a New Jersey casino. Sanders played a role in explaining how he, on the team's behalf, requested the casino's video footage of Janay Palmer being beaten in the elevator. He said the casino officer would only describe the video to him, and he relayed the information to Ravens executives. Sanders was publicly scrutinized for his lack of investigative effort when the media outlet, TMZ, obtained and released the video footage. Sanders' court date is scheduled for February 9 in Maryland.","Sanders is charged with a fourth-degree sex offense .

"Add Nevada and Idaho to the rapidly growing list of states to have their same-sex marriage bans tossed out in definitive fashion. A ruling by a federal appeals court Tuesday adds further momentum -- and a degree of inevitably -- to the idea of a civil marriage for gays and lesbians becoming a reality in a majority of U.S. states. Three judges from the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in California concluded the bans in the two Western states violated the equal protection rights of same-sex couples to legally marry. ""The lessons of our constitutional history are clear: inclusion strengthens, rather than weakens, our most important institutions,"" said the judges. ""When same-sex couples are married, just as when opposite-sex couples are married, they serve as models of loving commitment to all."" The decision comes after the Supreme Court on Monday let stand rulings striking down bans in five states and affecting similar laws in six others. That means that in coming weeks, 32 states could allow same-sex marriage, an increase of 13 states since the beginning of the month. Colorado and Utah announced Tuesday they would order county clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The decisions affecting Idaho and Nevada become the fourth such federal appeals court action to strike down voter-approved bans. State senator pops the question after Nevada's gay marriage ban falls . One of the original Idaho plaintiffs cheered the decision. ""It means so much for the courts to recognize our family and say that we must be treated equally,"" said Lori Watsen, who wed Sharene Watsen in New York in 2011. Their home state does not recognize their legal union. ""Our son will be able to grow up in a world where the state treats his family the same as other families. Today's ruling means that we can finally have the same legal protections as other married couples and the security of knowing that our family is legally secure."" But advocates on both sides of the issue are waiting to see what a federal appeals court in Cincinnati will decide on bans in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. Oral arguments by a judicial panel in August by the 6th Circuit suggested those bans may be upheld, in contrast to a nationwide trend over the past 15 months. A ruling there is expected any day. A potential ""circuit split"" may prove the impetus for the U.S. Supreme Court to ultimately decide whether same-sex couples nationwide have a constitutional right to tie the knot. By refusing to get involved now, the justices this week let stand appeals court rulings that immediately opened up the right to those in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. Because neighboring states are covered by the appeals court's jurisdiction, same-sex marriage could be extended in coming weeks to Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming. The high court's deliberate move to stand off to the side may indicate its natural instincts to go slowly -- to allow hot-button issues like his one to develop on their own, without interference from nine unelected justices. But the individual members of the bench may have also done some internal head counting and concluded with a shaky 5-4 conservative-liberal divide -- and moderate-conservative Anthony Kennedy the potential swing vote -- the final outcome was too uncertain to put same-sex marriage on the docket now. The cases in the 9th Circuit Court's decision are Sevcik v. Sandoval  (12-17668) in Nevada  and Latta v. Otter  (14-35420) in Idaho.","Court says same-sex marriage bans violate equal protection rights .

"Ebola has come to the United States -- first in the form of sick Americans brought home for treatment, now with one confirmed case in Dallas and others being monitored -- and public concern over that reality includes a pointed question: Who's in charge of stopping Ebola before it can spread? The global threat of the deadly virus is so serious that on Friday, Vice President Joe Biden likened Ebola to the brutal ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria: Together, they're ""the wolves closest to the door,"" Biden said. A series of events has unfolded since a visiting Liberian citizen in Texas became the first-ever Ebola case diagnosed in the United States this week: 50 more people in Dallas are being monitored for the disease. Officials struggle to clean a contaminated apartment there. And a patient in Washington, D.C., who recently visited Nigeria was hospitalized Friday and was being monitored for health issues that could be associated with Ebola. So, who's in charge of the battle against Ebola? It's a partnership between the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and state and local governments where an Ebola case occurs, said CDC Director Tom Frieden. But local officials ultimately are in charge of each case, he said. ""We work very closely with state and local governments, and when there's an episode in a state or local government, they are in charge, and we support them in every way,"" Frieden told CNN on Friday. ""They assign an incident manager. They establish an emergency operations system. They outline every aspect and we work very closely ... There's a great collaboration,"" Frieden added. In the Ebola case in Dallas, authorities at the state, county and city levels are working with the CDC. Specifically, it's Dallas County that's in charge, said Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, also director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management. The county has ""set up an Incident Management Center and is acting as the lead agency for the Ebola investigation and containment,"" said the county judge, who is vested with broad judicial and administrative powers under the Texas Constitution. Have there been any government snafus? Yes. Not surprisingly, there's bureaucratic red tape that has slowed government response to Texas' Ebola case and its attendant concerns. For example, the CDC sent a medical waste contractor to a Dallas apartment where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, had stayed and where his sweat-stained bed sheets and towels were still inside the unit. In fact, the days-long presence of the contaminated linens in the apartment was a controversy in itself. Duncan's partner, by whom he has a child and whose first name is Louise, told CNN about how she and three family members were being forced to live with the soiled materials since Sunday, when an ambulance took an ill Duncan to the hospital. Louise and the three relatives are in the apartment under a quarantine enforced by police. But the medical waste contractor couldn't begin the job Thursday because a Department of Transportation permit was needed to transport this type of unprecedented hazardous waste on Texas highways, a CDC spokeswoman said. By midday Friday, the contractor began cleaning the apartment. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged ""there are things that didn't go right in Dallas"" but added many responses went well too. ""Even though there were missteps there, there were good things that happened,"" Fauci said Friday. Has there been criticism? Yes, largely from Republicans. Even before the first case on U.S. soil, U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, urged President Barack Obama, a Democrat, to appoint one federal official to lead the U.S. strategy to address the worldwide Ebola outbreak, especially in Africa. ""Unfortunately, the lack of a central coordinator to facilitate cooperation between all of the U.S. efforts at home and abroad appears to have led to a delay in an effective U.S. government response and an absence of financial and operational accountability,"" Portman wrote to Obama last month. This week, another Republican, Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, urged Obama to appoint to an ""Ebola czar"" to address the outbreak in Africa, Moran told BuzzFeed News. Moran, however, didn't make any reference to the ongoing Texas situation. ""There is no person to go to, to tell us how all this is going to be funded,"" Moran said of the U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak in Africa. ""I don't think there is a person in charge,"" he added. ""And I don't think there is a plan internationally to bring the folks together to combat this."" For its part, the United Nations has set up the first-ever U.N. emergency health mission, the Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, to deal with the ""the unprecedented outbreak"" of Ebola, the agency said. What does Obama say about a U.S. Ebola czar? No. Obama doesn't want one. The White House said the structure of the federal response is ""sufficient,"" with particular officials leading the way on both domestic and international fronts. ""On the question of why we have not tapped an 'Ebola czar,' we are cognizant that doing so would create another layer of bureaucracy,"" a senior administration official said. ""To be sure, our response needs to be as nimble and as bureaucratically lean as possible in order to bring the overseas epidemic under control,"" the official said. ""We feel the current structure we have in place is sufficient."" On Friday, Lisa Monaco, Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, said the U.S. government has been ""enhancing our domestic preparedness to respond"" to cases like Texas. ""The United States has the most capable health care infrastructure and the best doctors in the world, bar none,"" Monaco said. ""The United States is prepared to deal with this crisis, both at home and in the region. Every Ebola outbreak over the past 40 years has been stopped."" CDC Director Frieden applauded the U.S. domestic response and cited how Texas has successfully established an incident management system. ""That's been done in Texas. They've done exactly what we've recommended. They have an incident manager in place. We're supporting that person. The state of Texas is supporting that person, and I'm confident we'll break the chain of transmission there,"" Frieden said.","Local officials ultimately are in charge of each U.S. Ebola case, CDC says .
But there have been problems between governmental units in the Dallas case .
Some Republican senators urge Obama to appoint an Ebola czar .
But the White House says no, stating that the leadership is sufficient ."
"As national Democrats are jumping at the chance to sink Rep. Steve Scalise, Louisiana Democrats are throwing the House majority whip a buoy. Democrats from the Bayou State, including a current congressman and two former statewide elected officials, are giving Scalise some much needed cover after his position in the Republican leadership was suddenly thrown up in the air Monday when his office confirmed an eyebrow-raising speech he gave to a David Duke-founded white supremacist group in 2002. Former U.S. Senator Bennett Johnston, a Democrat who beat back a challenge from Duke in 1990, said even he didn't know that  EURO as ""a racist organization."" ""I may disagree with Representative Scalise but a racist he is not. Nor would he have been stupid enough to knowingly address a racist group,"" Johnston said in a statement published in the Times-Picayune. ""While it is sometimes fun to see Republicans in trouble, you'd be wrong to blame Representative Steve Scalise for being racist on account of addressing a (EURO) meeting."" Johnston is now a lobbyist in Washington, D.C. and a strong supporter of oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. RELATED: Louisiana pols offer bipartisan backing for Steve Scalise . And former Louisiana governor Edwin Edwards, a Democrat who beat out Duke for the governorship in 1991, also ran to Scalise's defense. ""Sometimes you end up in front of these groups through no fault of your own and there are racial undertones,"" said Edwards, who lost a runoff this month to serve in the House, in an interview with the New York Times. Earlier in the week, Rep. Cedric Richmond, who will be the only Louisiana Democrat left on Capitol Hill next week, fended off attacks against Scalise leveled by Democratic officials in Washington. ""I am not going to let them use Steve as a scapegoat to score political points when I know him and know his family,"" Richmond, who is African-American, told the New Orleans Times-Picayune on Monday night. ""I don't think Steve Scalise has a racist bone in his body."" But the support from those stateside Democrats hasn't pushed Democrats in Washington from calling off the hounds. RELATED: GOP leadership stands by Scalise after white supremacist speech . Scalise called the appearance at European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO), a white supremacist group founded by Duke, a former Klu Klux Klan grand wizard, a ""mistake I regret"" and said the group was one of many he addressed when he was a state senator crisscrossing the state to drum up support for a piece of legislation. ""One of the many groups that I spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views I wholeheartedly condemn,"" Scalise said Tuesday in a statement. ""I am very disappointed that anyone would try to infer otherwise for political gain."" Among other Democratic spokesman in Washington, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee National Press Secretary Josh Schwerin said the revelation about Scalise made it ""clear their leadership has a history of embracing anti-Semitic, racist hate groups."" ""Steve Scalise chose to cheerlead for a group of KKK members and neo-Nazis at a white supremacist rally and now his fellow House Republican Leaders can't even speak up and say he was wrong. While David Duke defends Scalise, Speaker Boehner and Leader McCarthy are refusing to condemn Scalise's choice of allies,"" Schwerin said. The fallout: What you need to know .","A former Louisiana senator and governor also backed Scalise .

"House Speaker John Boehner's not waiting until New Year's Day for a hangover -- his headache is already here. Back-to-back House Republican dramas in the final week of the year are the latest indication that many of the issues the GOP hoped to leave behind when they take full control of Congress next week — an unruly base and scandal-prone members — will continue to dog them in the new year, and might even kick off 2015 with an attempted coup on the Speakership. Though Boehner was successfully able to convince Rep. Michael Grimm to resign on Monday after pleading guilty to a felony tax evasion charge last week, Rep. Steve Scalise, the majority whip now embroiled in scandal over a 2002 address he gave to a white supremacist conference, remains a tougher mess to clean up, leaving the speaker open to attack from the left and the right. In a coordinated move, both Boehner and his deputy, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, issued back-to-back statements of support for Scalise on Tuesday afternoon. But the fallout of his appearance at a conference of the European-American Unity and Rights Organization — a group founded by the infamous white supremacist and former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke — continued into Tuesday night as multiple national newspapers issued op-eds calling for Scalise to resign. But some in the party's right flank are aiming their fire at Boehner. Facing calls for a coup from his conservative base in next week's speaker race that grew louder on Tuesday, Boehner can't afford to let Scalise, a former Republican Study Committee chairman and one of his strongest links to that conservative base, go. While this wouldn't be the first time that Boehner's faced a conservative challenge for his speakership, many on Tuesday began to speculate that the controversy surrounding Scalise, and Boehner's handling of it, may breathe new life into a challenge. Tom Davis, a former Virginia congressman and chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, warned that starting the new Congress with a coup attempt would be ""catastrophic"" for a party hoping to sell itself as the capable and effective alternative to Democrats in the 2016 elections. ""[A speakership coup] would be the worse thing that could happen to the party. It would show they can't govern their own caucus, let alone the government,"" he said. ""When people unhappy with Obama look to Republicans for a governing party, this is the last thing they want to see."" He added: ""They have an opportunity to really produce some good legislative outcomes. Why would you jeopardize that at this point by starting of with turmoil?"" Boehner's backing of Scalese -- a move some on the right see as hypocritical -- put him in a precarious position heading into the speaker election. ""This has gotta make John Boehner nervous,"" one House GOP aide with ties to leadership told CNN of the continued controversy surrounding Scalise. That's because, if the fallout for Scalise continues, Boehner may not be able to afford to keep him. Scalise's alleged sins aren't unfamiliar to the GOP and exactly the kinds of associations the party is looking to avoid as it seeks to broaden its appeal to minority voters and improve its brand for the upcoming presidential elections. Democrats seized on the development, with a member of Congressional Black Leadership on Monday calling for Boehner to investigate the situation. On Tuesday, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the development ""deeply troubling."" And a House Democratic leadership aide said the party plans to keep up the pressure on Boehner and Scalise in the coming weeks. There are also growing indications that even standing by Scalise may not do Boehner much good in terms of getting a handle on an unruly caucus that's only grown more frustrated with leadership since the midterms. They recently emerged from a vote on a government funding bill crying mutiny because it failed to adequately oppose President Barack Obama's unilateral move on deportations and ObamaCare. Conservatives saw Scalise's vote for the ""cromnibus"" as the latest in a long line of his betrayals of the base. Despite repeated attempts, however, conservatives have never been able to lock down the necessary votes to oust Boehner, and a viable opponent, or even send the speaker contest to a second round of votes.  But Boehner's support for Scalise, some say, may cause enough ire within the base to reinvigorate the effort. What conservatives see as unequal treatment for a member of leadership has incensed many still smarting over their dismaying loss in the Mississippi Senate race primary. During that race, Sen. Thad Cochran's primary challenger, state Sen. Chris McDaniel, took heavy flak from the national and local GOP establishment for being billed alongside a white nationalist as a headliner at a conference that he never ultimately attended. McDaniel has said there's a clear ""double standard"" at work, and in a text message Monday night suggested that double standard could further stoke the ire of conservatives against leadership. ""Conservatives are driven and inspired by principles, not personalities. We therefore seek consistency with our elected officials. To the extent that they are not consistent, anger is the inevitable result,"" he said. ""So yes, many will be angry."" Indeed, conservative commentator Eric Erickson, hosting Rush Limbaugh's talk-radio show on Tuesday, said he's heard ""pretty credibly"" that conservatives have 25 of the 29 votes they need to oppose Boehner and at least send the speaker race to a second round. And he urged some of the incoming GOP freshmen to join the cause. ""Many of these guys ran saying, 'I oppose John Boehner — are they actually going to stand up now"" and vote against him, Erickson asked. ""I think this could undermine the leadership — and I think that's a good thing."" And Fox News Host Sean Hannity amplified the calls for a coup in a Tuesday statement to Brietbart News, declaring that it's ""time for new dynamic leadership"" in the House and naming South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Benghazi attacks, as his pick. Gowdy, however, quickly declined, underscoring the problem conservatives have encountered time and time again when attempting to overthrow Boehner — they've found no clear alternative to run against him. And many conservatives came out Tuesday offering their full support for Scalise, including Iowa Rep. Steve King, and Boehner's allies say they remain confident he'll be fine in the election. ""These guys thrive on making trouble,"" Davis said of conservatives, ""but I don't think Boehner's ever been stronger within the conference."" But Republicans on Capitol Hill admit the next week could make or break both Boehner and the GOP's chance at starting off the new Congress, and the path to the 2016 elections, on the right foot. ""Maybe after this week [a challenge to his speakership] could be a more serious conversation — but everybody I've talked to seems to think he's in a very solid shape,"" the House GOP aide said. But the aide added: ""It just depends on how Steve does. Boehner has kind of, in a way, tied himself to Steve now."" The fallout: What you need to know .","Back-to-back scandals for House GOP this week underscored their challenges in the new Congress .

"Grand jury dismissal of charges against police officers in the July 17, 2014, chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York has returned racism to the forefront of the American political debate. The entrance of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei into the fray, with tweets condemning American police and racism and using the hashtag #blacklivesmatter, has turned the debate into a farce. It's the equivalent of David Duke condemning anti-Semitism or North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un condemning prison overcrowding. But perhaps Khamenei's tweets can be a teachable moment, for Iranians and Americans both, about racism and injustice in Iran. In America, journalists discuss racism, politicians debate it and academics study it, because Americans enjoy free speech, a free press and can speak truth to power without fear or risk of torture. Not so with Iranians. In the months preceding the Shah's 1979 ouster, Iranians joined the revolution because they were tired of dictatorship, wanted democracy, and chafed under the SAVAK, the Shah's dictatorship. Revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini rallied Iranians to his cause. Before his return to Iran, Khomeini spoke the language of social justice and disavowed any interest in personal power. After the success of his revolution, Khomeini changed course. He may have executed many top-ranking SAVAK officers, but he soon took back their deputies to build the VeVAK (or Ministry of Information and Security), a new intelligence service different only in name. Iranians might be disillusioned with the regime's revolutionary fervor, but Khamenei, his top deputies and the Revolutionary Guards are not. Whether it's Evin or Kahrizak, Iranian prisons can make their American counterparts look like Club Med. While many Western commentators consider new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani a reformer, he is anything but. Sure, he purged IRGC veterans from his cabinet, but he replaced them not with liberals but with VeVAK veterans. The increasing rate of public executions since Rouhani took office shows that neither justice nor compassion are high priority values. What about racism? Here, too, Iranians might learn a lesson from America about tolerance and honest introspection. Some of these themes were explored tangentially in the 1986 Iranian art house drama, ""Bashu, the Little Stranger."" After the dark-skinned title character flees war and finds himself on a farm in northern Iran, the woman who finds him tries to scrub the darkness off his skin (many southern Iranians have dark skin, in part a legacy of the east African slave trade). The irony here is that Iran's minister of culture at the time, one Mohammad Khatami, initially banned the film for its negative depiction of war and its feminist overtones. Shining a spotlight on Iranian racism is the rule rather than the exception. Haji Firouz, a black-faced minstrel or clown, is a fixture in Iranian New Year gatherings in Iran. In a November 11, 2008, commentary, the Borna News Agency, an outlet close to then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called U.S. President Barack Obama a ""house slave."" After Obama's election, Jomhuri-ye Eslami, a daily newspaper close to Iran's Supreme Leader and intelligence services, dismissed Obama as ""a black immigrant."" And while the Revolutionary Guards' weekly, Sobh-e Sadegh, declared after Obama's election that ""A Dark Person Rises to Remove Darkness from America,"" it then continued to criticize him for hiring a Jewish chief of staff. Nor are blacks alone targeted. While some Iranians bend over backward to depict Iran as a tolerant community and home to the second largest Jewish community in the Middle East, they omit that this community is only one-sixth the size of what it was before the revolution, and declining steadily against the backdrop of both official and unofficial discrimination. Repeated rhetoric about Israel being a cancer—sometimes without any differentiation between Jews and Israel—takes a toll. In 2006, an Iranian newspaper published a cartoon depicting Azerbaijanis, Iran's largest ethnic minority, as cockroaches. In 2012, Iranian authorities in Isfahan banned Afghans from a public park. Iranian Arabs fare little better. Obama is right to say that the American willingness to confront problems head-on ""should make us optimistic."" As a Nobel peace laureate and an important voice on the world stage, Obama might cast moral and cultural equivalence aside and use his bully pulpit to respond to Khamenei, reminding the Iranian leader that the United States is far less racist than Iran.","Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei posts tweets condemning U.S. police, racism .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A British court's decision to issue an arrest warrant for former Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni is ""absurd,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday. Details of the arrest warrant were not immediately available -- news reports said it has been revoked -- but the prime minister denounced attempts to label Israeli officials as ""war criminals."" ""We will not accept that (Israeli) soldiers and commanders that bravely and morally defended our citizens from a cruel enemy will be called war criminals,"" he said. ""We reject this as absurd."" Livni was Israel's foreign minister during the Israeli military offensive in Gaza a year ago. The United Nations and some human-rights groups have blamed Israel and Hamas for human rights abuses during the conflict. Israeli National Security Adviser Uzi Arad told the British ambassador ""that the state of Israel expects that the government of Britain act against this immoral phenomenon that attempts to hamper Israel's right to defend herself,"" Netanyahu said in a statement. Netanyahu said Israel ""will not accept a situation"" in which Livni, Defense Minister Ehud Barak and former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ""will be summoned to the dock."" Olmert was prime minister during Israel's three-week offensive against Hamas in Gaza a year ago. Britain's Foreign Office said the United Kingdom was not trying to hamper the peace process. ""The UK is determined to do all it can to promote peace in the Middle East, and to be a strategic partner of Israel,"" the Foreign Office said in a statement. ""To do this, Israel's leaders need to be able to come to the UK for talks with the British government. We are looking urgently at the implications of this case."" It was not clear who sought the warrant from Westminster Magistrates Court. A Foreign Office spokesman said the warrant did not require ministerial approval; it was issued at the court's discretion. The arrest warrant was revoked once it was clear Livni was not in Britain, BBC News reported. A diplomatic source familiar with the case told CNN that Westminster Magistrates' Court in London issued the warrant ""recently."" The Crown Prosecution Service, however, told CNN it could not confirm or deny the existence of any arrest warrant. Israel said the warrant was issued ""at the behest of radical elements"" and ""anti-Israel elements."" ""This arrest warrant makes a mockery of universal jurisdiction,"" said Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Daniel Ayalon, who was also the subject of a potential arrest warrant when he visited the United Kingdom last month. ""There are those in the international community who are trying to single out Israel in its fight against terrorism."" Ayalon added: ""I don't see how Israelis and other officials can continue to visit the U.K. if this troublesome situation continues."" Livni had been invited to participate in a conference in England but turned down the offer two weeks ago because of a scheduling conflict, according to her office. The statement said further that Livni had no knowledge that a warrant would be issued when she declined the invitation. Two months ago, British lawyers working on behalf of 16 Palestinian clients petitioned a London court to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak while he was on an official visit in London. The court ruled that Barak enjoyed immunity while on official state business. CNN's Kevin Flower and Jonathan Wald contributed to this report.","Israel condemns UK court decision to issue arrest warrant for Israeli opposition leader Tzipi Livni .

The sausage is a specialty of the Champagne Ardenne region and yes, there is a certain irony in the world's glitziest wine being combined with the world's least-glamorous sausage. Legend has it that the andouillette can trace its origins to the Middle Ages, and it certainly smells like it. The andouillette should be made by hand so, like snowflakes, no two are the same. Also like snowflakes, they can be eaten cold, but hot is preferred to get the full effect of the smell. Snag it: Charcuterie Marc Colin, 3 Place General de Gaulle, Chablis, France; +33 386 42 10 62 . Haggis . Scotland's top chefs may try to pass it off as haute cuisine, but there's no escaping the fact that the country's most famous dish -- haggis -- is just a big sausage, albeit one filled with mutton rather than pork. To make it, sheep heart, lungs and liver are all blended together with oatmeal and packaged up in a sheep's stomach to be slowly simmered into submission. Onion and spices give it a bit of a kick and it's often served in combination with ""neeps and tatties"" -- mashed swedes and potatoes. It's not every sausage that gets celebrated in verse. Scottish national poet Robert Burns hailed the haggis as ""great chieftain o the puddin'-race."" Other sausages should take note. Snag it: Wedgwood The Restaurant, Royal Mile, 267 Canongate, Edinburgh, UK; +44 131 558 8737 . Hog's Pudding . This delicacy from Devon and Cornwall in southwest England takes something porkers have in abundance -- fat -- and makes an entire meal out of it. Hog fat blended with oatmeal, suet and barley is somewhat on the bland side, but the addition of handfuls of cumin and garlic means there is some flavor. Not scary enough? Wait until it's time to cook. This grease beast spits like a camel and cooks will need to dress like firefighters to stay safe when frying -- or risk the whole thing exploding in the oven if baked. Snag it: Al Martin and Son Butchers, 7 The Square, Chagford, Devon, UK; +44 1647 432461 . Zungenwurst . With more than 1,500 varieties, no one could accuse Germany of shirking its sausage duties. Inevitably some of these are ""acquired tastes."" Among them is a form of ""head cheese"" known as Zungenwurst, or blood tongue. Head cheese has nothing to do with milk, but is a terrine made from anything north of an animal's neck -- in this case the pickled tongue of a pig or cow. Zungenwurst is, in fact, a mix of blood, tongue, bread crumbs and oatmeal. The brown-black sausage is cured so it can be eaten cold but is usually sliced and then fried in a little butter. Snag it: Straight from the farm. Hofmetzgerei in the Bavarian village of Geiersthal slaughters the animals and makes the sausage on the spot; +49 9923 2240 . Azaruja . The ""botifarra"" variety of this Portuguese sausage uses parts of the pig lesser sausages leave behind. Ears, snout, the head itself -- nothing is wasted. They are prepared and cooked in the home during pig-slaughtering season -- yes there's a pig slaughtering season -- from December to February. The Azaruja botifarra is a local adaptation of a sausage hauled into the region by Catalans in the 19th century. Snag it: Carnes Assuda butchers, Rua Revendedora, Evora, Portugal; +351 266 703 177 . Morcilla de Burgos . Watched ""Twilight"" and thought, ""yes, I see the attraction?"" There's a sausage for that. Blood sausage comes in many forms throughout Europe. This northern Spanish version blends pig's blood with rice and seasoning such as oregano, salt, pepper and paprika. Lard binds it and onion bulks it out and, if you're lucky, it'll be served in cow tripe skin. After boiling, it is usually eaten in thin fried slices. It's characteristically brown, rather than black. Snag it: Restaurante Casa Ojeda, Burgos, Spain; +34 947 20 90 52 . Danish Blodpose . What could make blood sausage more -- or, indeed, less -- appealing? How about sugar? Danish blodpolse includes the red stuff, but also milk, sugar, raisins and cardamon, all lovingly bound together with suet. This sweetened version isn't aimed at fooling kids into eating offal. In fact, there is an interesting historical reason for the invention of sweet blood pudding -- in the past sugar was not merely a sweetener, but a flavor enhancer, so by including sugar you could really enjoy the blood. Blodpolse is usually dished up with stewed apples, butter cinnamon and syrup. It's like all the courses of a meal in a single skin. Who could resist?

"About halfway between Rome and Naples, something magical is happening in a picturesque Italian town they call the ""Village of Eternity."" If you come to Campodimele to sip an espresso in the main piazza, feast on spaghetti with ricotta sauce or walk along the medieval city wall, you will be relaxing in a place with one of the longest life expectancies on the planet. Is it the peaceful surroundings? The pure mountain air? The stress-free lifestyle? The wonderful food? Whatever the reason, Campodimele's residents can expect to live to 95, writes Tracey Lawson, a British journalist who became intrigued by the village and traveled there to experience its charms and discover its secrets. ""When I got there, I just fell in love with the place,"" Lawson said. ""My life became seasonal and had a rhythm imposed upon it, which I very much liked."" She went hunting for wild asparagus, ate sugary ripe figs fresh from the tree and learned how to make pasta from the locals, just a few of the pleasures she found in Campodimele. She believes that the local cuisine -- made up of fresh, seasonal, locally grown food -- plays a key role in the residents' extraordinary longevity. Try a 'Village of Eternity' recipe: Stuffed, baked eggplant . Lawson, 43, didn't just get a glimpse into how to live long; she also discovered how to live well, she writes in ""A Year in the Village of Eternity,"" a book that's both a love letter to the town and a collection of its recipes. Lawson recently spoke with CNN from her home in Carlisle, in northern England. She divides her time between the U.K. and Campodimele but hopes to permanently move to Italy. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: What is Campodimele like? Tracey Lawson: Campodimele is a classic Italian rural idyll. It's a village that is about 1,000 years old and situated on a mountain top in the middle of the Aurunci Mountains. It's about 25 km (15 miles) from the Tyrrhenian Sea coast. A lot of tourists tend to zip from Rome to Naples; they go straight down the motorway, and they miss out this area inland. The village is just this little cluster of medieval houses made out of stone, lots of lovely stone staircases and little piazzas. It has a perfect circular wall, which dates from the 11th century with 12 turrets. Lots of the houses that people live in are actually built into the defensive walls, so some of the kitchens that I was lucky enough to cook in and been invited into are literally 1,000 years old. There are olive trees on the slopes in the background. It's very beautiful. CNN: What advice can you offer for travelers who want to go? Lawson: The first thing I would do is go to the main piazza. It's very beautiful, because it sort of drops off the edge of the valley so you can see all across the Liri Valley. There's a bar on the piazza which is called the Moonlight Café. It may take its name from the fact that when you're sitting on the piazza outside the café, the moon just sort of rises like a lantern. It really does meet all your expectations of a beautiful Italian village. CNN: The town seems to be big on food festivals. What are they like? Lawson: One of the nicest times to go to Campodimele is in August, when there are two key food festivals. One is the festival of the ""cicerchie."" The cicerchie is a small bean that looks a bit like a squashed chickpea, and it's very particular to Campodimele. It's got a taste all of its own. It's sort of sweet and musty, and it's one of the key dishes of Campodimele. During the festival, they cook the cicerchie in huge vats on the street. People come from as far away as Rome and Naples just to come and taste it. They also have the festival of ""laine e fagioli."" Laine is simple pasta ribbons made out of just flour and water. It's sort of the poor man's pasta, as opposed to pasta that is made from flour and eggs, which is richer. There are stalls laid out in the village, and you can see the ladies rolling the pasta and cutting it into ribbons. Then it's served up to the public with sort of a tomato sauce laced with beans and onions. CNN: In the spring, you were also invited to taste the first shallots of the season, which pack quite a punch. How did you like eating a raw shallot? Lawson: It nearly blew my head off, seriously. Think of the worst shot of vodka you've ever had, but it tastes like onions. But they're absolutely delicious fried. The shallot festival is just a very local, impromptu thing. It's not an organized festival. But if you happen to be in the village around that time, you'd be very welcome to try them out. CNN: Where can you stay or eat in Campodimele? Lawson: There is a hotel called Spunta la Luna. The quality of food in the local restaurants is amazing. It's all locally sourced. The standard method of raising produce is organically. They don't even bother using the word ""organic"" because it's just so normal to them, there's no need to use the phrase. So it's all locally grown fruits and vegetables. A lot of the restaurants serve goat or wild boar, which is hunted on the hills. CNN: You were eating so many delicious things when you lived in the village. Did you lose weight or gain weight during your time there? Or did you even care? Lawson: I didn't really care too much. But I did lose a lot of weight, despite the fact that I must have been eating a lot more calories. Everything has a lot more olive oil. I just put olive oil on everything, and I still do. I really think it's the elixir of life. I think the weight loss is probably due to the lack of stress. I always have this theory that it would make sense that if your body is full of adrenaline, your fight-or-flight mechanism is going to tell your body to conserve fat. CNN: How do you get to Campodimele? Lawson: If you are in Rome or Naples, you can get a train, which runs directly between those two cities and jump off at the town of Formia. It's much easier to go by car. If you come down from Rome, which takes about an hour and 40 minutes, you would actually travel along the Via Appia (the ancient Appian Way) so it's a very historic route. Once you get outside of Rome, it's very much green fields and blue skies. Once you turn off the major roads, you're actually traveling upland into the mountains, so there are lovely winding roads and green tunnels of trees. The only thing I would say is, watch out for cows on the road. Don't speed, because the cows just stand in the middle of the road, and they just look at you. At nighttime, you've got to watch out for the wild boar, which run along the road as well.","Residents of idyllic Campodimele, Italy, can expect to live to 95 .

"Americans love the queen. As Britain prepares to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's 60th year on the throne, the sovereign's popularity in the United States is at a 15-year high -- 82% of Americans say they have a favorable opinion of the queen in a CNN/ORC poll released Friday. That's a 35-point jump from 1997, when her favorable rating stood at 47%. That was the year Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris. Many Americans and Brits were disappointed in the royal family's handling of the death of the ""people's princess,"" saying the queen didn't sufficiently reflect her subjects' sense of loss following the accident. Since then, however, Queen Elizabeth's favorable ratings have been on the rise, reaching 75% in 2002 and 80% in 2007. Next week the United Kingdom will put royal pageantry on full display in celebration of the queen's Diamond Jubilee. The high point will be Thames Jubilee Pageant, a 1,000-boat flotilla led by the queen aboard the royal barge. ""Americans love Queen Elizabeth and they think the royal family is a good thing for the people of England, but only one in eight would like to see royalty here in the United States,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. The poll showed 77% of Americans saying the royal family is good for the people of England. Follow CNN's Diamond Jubilee coverage . Among her fellow royals, the queen reigns in popularity -- Prince William, her grandson, had a 77% favorable rating. His brother Prince Harry stood at 70%. William's wife is similarly popular. The Duchess of Cambridge, known as Kate Middleton before her marriage to William, had a favorable rating of 73%. Her wedding last April drew hundreds of millions of television viewers, and sparked a renewed interest in Britain's royal family among Americans. Prince Charles, first in line to succeed Queen Elizabeth, had a more modest favorable rating than his mother. ""Prince Charles' favorable rating, at 57%, is comparatively low, and only 36% have a positive view of his wife, the former Camilla Parker Bowles,"" Holland said. The prince, who underwent a high profile divorce from Diana in 1996, married his long-time companion Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005. Camilla took the title Duchess of Cornwall upon her marriage to Charles. Prince Philip, the queen's husband, is not as popular as his wife, though is still viewed favorably by 59% of Americans. The CNN/ORC poll surveyed 1,009 adult Americans by telephone between May 29-31, 2012. The sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points. Celebrating the Diamond Jubilee in the U.S.?

"(CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden recently confided a sensational bit of news to the New Yorker magazine: In a 2011 meeting with Vladimir Putin, he had actually told Russia's then-prime minister that he had no ""soul."" Even more remarkable was Putin's response. ""And he looked back at me, and he smiled, and he said, 'We understand one another.' "" Many people -- in Ukraine, Europe, America and even Russia -- probably share Biden and Putin's estimation of the Russian president's spiritual condition. In saying Putin has no soul, it means he seems to lack both the capacity to feel emotions and to show empathy. Russia's leader certainly has a long record of inhumanity. He was an agent of the Soviet secret police, a criminal institution with a record that goes back to the purges of Stalin, a record more bloody than that of the Nazi SS. John Dunlop of Stanford's Hoover Institution wrote in ""The Moscow Bombings"" that there is strong evidence to suggest that Putin was in on the plot to bomb two apartment buildings in Moscow in September 1999, in which 300 Russian citizens were killed and several hundred others were wounded. He says the bombings were blamed on Chechen rebels as a pretext to invade Chechnya. Putin has funded, promoted, supplied and aided and abetted the Russian and pro-Russian terrorists in eastern Ukraine. And by invading Crimea, he created the conditions of war, hatred and fanaticism that led to the destruction of 298 innocent lives aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on that day of infamy, July 17. Who are Ukraine's pro-Russia rebels? Is Putin evil? His actions certainly are, if by evil we understand behavior that willfully, consciously and purposely destroys human life. Perhaps we can call his actions undeniably evil and Putin himself ""evil enough."" Evil enough for what? Evil enough for condemnation by people of good will. How rebels in Ukraine built up an arsenal capable of reaching the skies . If Putin is ""evil enough,"" what are the implications for policy-makers? First, they should openly state that they condemn Putin's behavior. Because silence implies approval, policy-makers must understand that their moral standing, like that of the countries they represent, is on the line. Evil is indivisible. If they refuse to condemn this instance, they effectively surrender the right to condemn any instance of evil. Second, they should refuse to shake his hand, engage in chitchat, attend photo ops with him and in any way create the impression that they accept his behavior as a socially acceptable. German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not hobnob with a German neo-Nazi; President Barack Obama would not have drinks with the head of the Ku Klux Klan. By extension, neither of them should hobnob with Putin at World Cup soccer games. Third, policy-makers should avoid doing anything that aids and abets Putin's proclivities. Since those proclivities largely rest on his ability to employ armaments to cause death, any form of assistance to Putin's war machine or repressive apparatus is the moral equivalent of supplying barbed wire and bullets to Auschwitz. Two examples will illustrate this point. The Dusseldorf-based German defense company Rheinmetall is manifestly abetting Putin's evildoing by continuing to insist that it has ""to meet its contractual obligations with Moscow and finalize a combat simulation center where up to 30,000 soldiers could be trained annually."" Since Rheinmetall signed the contract with Russia in 2011, when Putin's record was already on full display to the world, it cannot claim ignorance of Putin's evil intentions. France's continued determination to supply the Putin war machine with two Mistral-class assault ships is no less of a moral outrage. As Robert C. O'Brien, a former U.S. representative to the United Nations, argues, ""With the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight No. 17, it should now be clear to all observers that Russia is fully intent on subjugating and intimidating its former Soviet constituent states and Warsaw Pact allies, and will do so with the most advanced weapons in its inventory. ""There is no reason to believe that the Mistral-class warships, once in the Russian Navy, will not also be used in the Black Sea, Baltic and Pacific to further increase the pressure on Russia's neighbors. Given its recent history, Moscow should not be handed another military tool of the Mistral-class magnitude."" This does not mean that morally concerned policy makers should refrain from talking to him entirely. As professor Walter Clemens, an associate of Harvard's Davis Center, argues in a fascinating paper, ""Can -- Should -- Must We Negotiate with Evil?"": ""If a cruel dictatorship is willing to negotiate security arrangements likely to limit arms competition and make war less likely, democratic governments should engage and seek verifiable arrangements."" So, yes, according to this logic, talk to Putin about making ""war less likely"" in eastern Ukraine and talk to him about limiting ""arms competition."" Otherwise, shun him and everything he stands for. Opinion: Are the pro-Russian rebels terrorists? Such countries as France and Germany, which have extensive economic relations with Russia, face a difficult moral choice. They must ask themselves whether Putin is evil or evil enough. If they decide his killing spree in eastern Ukraine is neither evil nor evil enough, they must explain -- to themselves and to the rest of the world -- just why they believe the destruction of Ukrainian, Russian, Malaysian, Dutch and other lives is not a form of evil behavior. If, alternatively, Putin's behavior strikes them as evil, they must either act on that conviction, in the manner suggested above, or explain to themselves and the rest of the world just why their enhancing Putin's war-making proclivities is not wrong. Pentagon: Russia getting ready to send more powerful weapons into Ukraine . Ultimately, France and Germany, as well as all countries that aid and abet Russia's destructive capabilities, have to decide whether they care more about values or about money. Dictatorships can answer that question easily: Their leaders are indifferent to values. Prosperous capitalist democracies, and especially prosperous capitalist democracies that are part of a self-styled community of values called the European Union, cannot take the easy way out and pretend values do not matter. In the final analysis, the willingness of France, Germany and all the other states making up the European Union to respond to Putin's evil doing will determine the moral fate of the EU. If they sacrifice morality to arms contracts or gas, the EU will have lost its rasion d'etre. Worse, like Putin, it will be without a soul.","Alexander Motyl says Putin has promoted, supplied Russian and pro-Russian terrorists .

"An online video showing a now-former Costa Rican official in her underwear has sparked a debate over the privacy of government workers in the Central American country -- and cost the official her job this week. The video shows Karina Bolanos, who had been Costa Rica's vice minister of culture and youth since 2006, lying on a bed in her underwear and apparently talking to her lover. ""I miss you. I love you with all my soul. And everything that you see here is yours,"" she says. The cultural ministry said Monday that Bolanos would be leaving her post after a surge in journalistic reports and social media posts ""connected with the private life of the vice minister."" ""Even though the information that has circulated is strictly related with the private life of Bolanos, and not with her work as a public official, she was released from her post so that she could face this in the private sphere,"" the cultural ministry said in a statement, adding Costa Rica's president authorized the move. Bolanos, 39, told CNN en Español Tuesday that she recorded the private video in 2007, when she was separated from her husband, a Costa Rican congressman. ""It is a very old and personal video of mine, that really makes me very embarrassed with the Costa Rican people and I apologize, especially before the youth who I represent. ... but also it has nothing that I should be ashamed of, and I think an injustice has been committed,"" she said. Bolanos said she did not have a chance to defend herself before she lost her job. ""I think as a woman, I had a right to defend myself and to speak. These are questions of my intimate private life that have nothing to do with my work,"" she said. A computer engineer that her family had hired to install security cameras stole the video and tried to blackmail her to stop its release, she said. ""It is very difficult to prove because he is a computer engineer and he is one of those people that hacks and steals accounts, and...because my husband is a congressman and I am a vice minister, he took advantage of the situation to get money out of us,"" she said. By Tuesday evening, the video had been viewed more than 370,000 times on YouTube.","A video shows a now-former top cultural official lying on a bed in her underwear .

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal appeals court ruled Friday the Transportation Security Administration can still use full-body scanners at airports, but said the agency erred in how it deployed the controversial machines. A privacy group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, had sued the TSA claiming the machines violated Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. The group further argued that the TSA did not follow the required procedures before making significant policy changes, such as subjecting travelers to the full-body scanners. The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington rejected the first argument, concluding that there was no violation on constitutional grounds. But they agreed on the second point, saying TSA must now go through proper procedures -- though the court, significantly, did not order the agency to stop using the machines immediately. There is an ""obvious need for the TSA to continue its airport security operations without interruption,"" the judges ruled. Either side can appeal to the full appeals court or the Supreme Court. But another, more likely scenario is that TSA, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, will go through the public comment and rule-making process. The agency's decision following that process could then become the basis for future lawsuits. ""This is not over by any means,"" said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. TSA officers operate more than 500 of the body imaging machines, which can see through clothes and reveal concealed objects, including bombs and bomb components. TSA plans to have more than 1,000 machines in use at airports nationwide by the end of this year. Passengers are not required to submit to the scans, and may opt for pat-downs. But, the court noted, ""many passengers ... remain unaware of this right, and some who have exercised the right have complained that the resulting pat-down was unnecessarily aggressive."" The Electronic Privacy Information Center argued that the scanners violate passengers' Fourth Amendment rights because, the group claimed, the search is more invasive than necessary to detect weapons or explosives. But the court said the government must weigh ""the degree to which (the search) intrudes upon an individual's privacy and... the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests."" ""The balance clearly favors the government here,"" the court said. Yet the judges took a swipe at the TSA's argument that its plans to implement the technology did not merit a formal public comment and rule-making process. ""It is clear that by producing an image of the unclothed passenger, an (Automated Imaging Technology) scanner intrudes upon his or her personal privacy in a way a magnetometer does not,"" the court noted. The court also debunked the privacy group's allegation in its lawsuit that TSA had violated the Video Voyeurism Prevention Act. The judges also labeled as ""silly"" the claim that the federal agency is not engaged in law enforcement. The TSA said in a statement that it is reviewing the ruling. Rotenberg, meanwhile, called the court's decision important and said it ""pins"" down TSA to a policy in which body scans are optional. Privacy advocates had worried the use of scanners could become mandatory, as they become more ubiquitous at airports. ""I think the court would have had a very different conclusion"" had body scans been mandatory, Rotenberg said.","A U.S. appeals court weighs in on a lawsuit against the TSA over full-body scanners .
The panel rules the machines don't violate protections against unreasonable searches .
Judges find the TSA did not go through the right process before deploying the machines ."
"The week before Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, Millisia White came back to her native city on a trip for work. She stayed behind to help her family recover and has been home ever since. There was something she felt she had to do. ""When something you are so familiar with is threatened to be lost forever, you cling to what's familiar,"" said White, who moved back from Atlanta. For White and her brother, that meant bringing back a century-old New Orleans practice of masking, or masquerading, which was nearly vanishing. That year, she founded the New Orleans Society of Dance and incorporated into the dance company a cultural legacy series of dance performance that would revive tradition of the Baby Dolls -- with a modern twist. ""We wanted to do something representing this tradition and what it meant and symbolize it in some form."" The Baby Doll practice started about 1912, when groups of women in New Orleans' red light district poked fun at society's stereotypes of women by marching in street parades dressed as dolls. It grew into a tradition centered on dance and paired with jazz bands of the popular music of the era. Groups of women embraced the attitude of freedom and the pageantry of the Baby Doll street parades, but their focus grew over the decades. They organized and began serving their community through groups called ""social aid and pleasure clubs."" ""These were just people who were very much of their community,"" said Karen Leathem, a historian with the Louisiana State Museum. ""They tried to help their neighbors during an era of segregation and limited opportunity for all people of color."" However, by the 1980s and 1990s, only a handful of groups were masking as Baby Dolls. Several neighborhood groups like the Million Dollar Baby Dolls and the Ernie K-Doe Baby Dolls were active in the new millennium. But by 2005, the Baby Doll practice seemed as if it was about to be forgotten in Katrina's wake. ""My brother and I decided, we needed a sort of campaign,"" White remembered. ""It all started so we could give something back in our own backyard."" She had heard about the Baby Doll tradition as a child and felt that it was a medium close to her heart. ""It's synonymous with dance and with women,"" she said. White's revival produced the Baby Doll Ladies, with costumes, face paint, music and dances that are modern takes on the Baby Dolls of the past. Rather than using a live band, her brother DJ Hektik plays mixes of hip-hop and jazz for their choreographed performances. But White also wanted to bring back the community focus central to the Baby Doll tradition. By partnering with local schools and cultural organizations, the Baby Doll Ladies connect with youth through education and outreach programs. ""Mainly, our focus as been creating creative movement-based workshops and motivational assemblies,"" she said. Led by the fully costumed Baby Doll Ladies ensemble, the group takes students from the history of jazz to modern hip-hop. The kindergarten-12th grade workshops bring a cultural history lesson to inner city youth, many of whom don't know the history of New Orleans' treasured music and cultural practices. ""We just treat it like we're in Idaho,"" White joked. ""We just take it from scratch with them, introducing the culture, the significance of all that's positive about the African-American tradition."" Sine their debut at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 2009 and the Zulu parade during Mardi Gras 2010, the Baby Doll Ladies have grown from a dance ensemble to an organization of women inspired to do good in their community. ""It evolved from a promiscuous background to neighborhood groups mimicking that behavior,"" White said, ""to now, women of excellence."" With a group of Honorary Baby Doll Ladies, the group is has more than 40 members this year. From health professionals to bus drivers to charity organizers, each of the women inducted into the group uses her time and talents to further the Baby Doll Ladies' mission. For White and others, the legacy of the revival was in safeguarding the history of the tradition. ""The first responsibility that we really felt was the need to preserve it,"" she said. ""I couldn't think past the museum."" White helped curate the first Baby Doll exhibit at the Presbytere with a group of historians and authors. Working with Baby Doll elders and the descendants of Baby Dolls, the exhibit shares their stories and traditions with artifacts in the museum. As their membership grows, the Baby Doll Ladies hope their mission to reach their community through the practice will grow as well. This year includes plans for health and wellness seminars to go along with their education outreach. ""It's related to what these women did in the '30s and '40s,"" Leathem said. ""They dressed as Baby Dolls for Mardi Gras day, but they were still a cohesive group the rest of the year.""","Baby Doll masking practice started in New Orleans about 1912 .

She had no idea her daughter was using apps such as Ask.fm and Kik, and was being tormented on the new platforms. ""I had never even heard of them; I did go through her phone but didn't even know,"" she told the Times. ""Even though (Rebecca) was separated from the bullies because she was in a different school ... ultimately they were able to get back and I don't know if it's pick at each other but certainly say hateful things,"" said Judd, whose office is investigating the case. Share your bullying story . 'Parents don't know about them' In conversations with law enforcement, educators, bullying experts and parents, it's clear that while parents may be getting up to speed on some social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, there are plenty of other platforms popular with tweens and teens that parents don't know. In addition to Ask.fm and Kik, there's Voxer, which is a walkie-talkie-type app for messaging, and Snapchat, which allows the sender to set a time limit for how long recipients can view their photo, text or video messages. (Check out our gallery above for other sites your teen might be using!) ""The biggest part of these sites is parents don't know about them,"" said Sue Scheff, author of the book ""Wit's End: Advice and Resources for Saving Your Out-of-control Teen."" Are we too quick to cry 'bully'? ""What happens is a new site, we won't find out about it until a tragedy happens but the kids know about it,"" Scheff said. ""It's as simple as that. No one really knew a lot about Ask.fm until Rebecca died."" How children are using the sites is a concern for parents and educators across the country. Brian Lidle, the principal at Ann Simpson Davis Middle School in Dublin, Ohio, said he's seen as many as a dozen cases of student harassment on Kik during the past several months. ""It's just a very difficult thing to see, a child being harassed by nameless, faceless people and feel ganged up on,"" Lidle said. He said that  the school has gone to the authorities but that Kik has not shared information about who is behind the harassing accounts. ""We were very frustrated at that point, so what we decided to do is really get the parents in the mix,"" Lidle said. ""And as we get information in, I've been sharing that with our parents through our e-mail list service and just to make sure they know what apps are out there, what's happening to them."" In response to an interview request from CNN, a Kik spokesman said the Canada-based company ""actively cooperates with law enforcement agencies all over the world to help ensure the safety of our users."" Hanna Smith suicide fuels calls for action on Ask.fm cyberbullying . ""The safety and well-being of our users is extremely important to us,"" spokesman Bob Patterson said. He said the site has added new features over the past few years, such as the ability to block other users without revealing they've been blocked. The company also developed a parent guide to provide information about ""how parents can help their teens ... have a great (and safe) experience on Kik."" ""Kik has policies in place to help us respond in the best way possible when something is reported to us by one of our users, or if we are contacted by law enforcement,"" Patterson added. As for Ask.fm, in a statement, a spokesman said that in light of recent events, the Latvia-based company is working with online child safety expert Annie Mullins to review and update its safety and privacy policies to ensure that its ""abuse and inappropriate content reporting systems are among the most effective in the industry."" ""We are committed to doing everything we can to protect our users and stamp out bullying or any other kind of abuse. Sadly bullying can take place anywhere -- on or offline -- so it is important we, parents and users work together to fight it,"" the statement said. ""If a user sees something that isn't appropriate before we do, we would ask that they help us stand up to bullies by reporting it. Any complaints made about this kind of abuse are prioritised automatically and will be dealt with immediately."" Coach suspends entire football team after bullying . Teens want to be 'validated' Why are kids downloading these apps? Sameer Hinduja, criminology professor at Florida Atlantic University and co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center, says part of the appeal of platforms like Ask.fm -- where you create a profile and allow people to ask you questions -- is the need for affirmation. ""You need to be validated when you're a teenager because you are wondering if you're turning out OK, and so these sites completely meet that need,"" Hinduja said. ""Because it's like, 'This is so great. Someone asked me a question. Someone took the time to visit my profile ... and like my picture and leave a comment.' ""I understand why kids do it, but there's way more negatives than positives that could possibly come out of it, and if I were raising a son or daughter, I would be like, 'Why do you care so much about people asking you these questions and demonstrating interest in you this way, because it opens you up for more harassment,' "" said Hinduja, co-author of ""Words Wound: Delete Cyberbullying and Make Kindness Go Viral,"" a book for teens to be released in December. If you are a parent and you are slightly freaked right now, I can relate. I can't even imagine what apps, sites and platforms will be around when my kids, who are 5 and 7, are in the middle and high school years. But Hinduja, whose site has numerous resources for parents, says parents can feel empowered rather than overwhelmed by being as actively involved in their kids' online lives as they are in their offline lives. That means being familiar with the technology but not necessarily declaring sites like Ask.fm and Kik off-limits. ""Kids don't want to hear us preach and lecture about all of (technology's) evils. They will immediately tune out,"" Hinduja said. The better approach, he said, is to embrace the latest technology and strike up conversations with your kids about it, asking them about stories of bullying and harassment in the news. ""Constantly having these conversations with kids so that they know their parent is not oblivious to these issues goes such a long way,"" he said. Advertisers pull out after social media suicide . Lidle, the middle school principal, agrees and encourages parents to plunge fully into their kids' online world. ""This is not our world that kids are operating in,"" Lidle said. ""They call us digital immigrants. We have to immerse ourselves in what's going on in their world, as uncomfortable as it is. Our kids are at stake, and we cannot drop the vigilance of knowing what's going on in their worlds."" Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said parents should also keep open communication with their kids' friends. ""A lot of times, you'll hear from your children's friends before you hear from your own child,"" he said. Join us October 29 for a Google Hangout on bullying .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Ecuador have banned alcohol sales in an emergency measure to stop contaminated drinks from reaching consumers after at least 21 people died. Officials announced the 72-hour national dry law Sunday  after detecting alcohol poisoning cases in several parts of the  country. Hospitals treated more than 100 people who fell ill after drinking bootleg liquor over the past week, the country's government said, and at least 21 people died as a result of apparent poisoning. Investigators determined that  the liquor contained methanol -- an  industrial-grade alcohol not intended for human consumption, Ecuador's  Public Health Ministry said. ""It   is a potent poison that can in small quantities, including a quarter  of a  cup, cause the death of the individual that consumes it,"" Health   Minister David Chiriboga told reporters. The liquor was sold in unlabeled bottles, with no indication of its contents or where it originated, Los Rios Gov. Jesus Narvaez told CNN affiliate Ecuavisa. Doctors in the province first began seeing cases of alcohol poisoning last Tuesday, Ecuador's government said. By Sunday, 103 patients showing symptoms had showed up at local hospitals. Authorities in Los Rios implemented a curfew, shut down bars and confiscated hundreds of unlabeled bottles containing bootleg alcohol, Ecuavisa reported. The liquor ""was massively consumed"" during a festival in the town of Urdaneta, Los Rios, Ecuador's government said in a statement. The 21 patients who died all haled from Los Rios, but similar poisoning cases have also been reported in at least four other areas, the government said. Authorities have arrested the liquor seller and continue investigating, police said.","NEW: Health minister: The contaminated alcohol contained a ""potent poison""

"A respiratory virus that has sent hundreds of children to hospitals in Missouri is causing alarm across the Midwest and beyond. Ten states have contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for help investigating clusters of the virus that's being blamed for the illness. List of states with the Enterovirus . Health officials say they're still figuring out what's going on. The bug that appears to be causing most of the concern has a typically arcane name -- Enterovirus EV-D68 -- but many of its symptoms are very common. Here's what you need to know about the virus. What are enteroviruses? Enteroviruses, which bring on symptoms like a very intense cold, aren't unusual. They're actually very common. When you have a bad summer cold, often what you have is an enterovirus, said Mark Pallansch, a virologist and director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Viral Diseases. There are more than 100 types of enteroviruses causing about 10 to 15 million infections in the United States each year, according to the CDC. They are carried in the intestinal tract and often spread to other parts of the body. The season often hits its peak in September, as summer ends and fall begins. Why Enterovirus infections are difficult to track . So why all the concern now? What's unusual at the moment is the high number of hospitalizations. The virus has sent more than 30 children a day to a Kansas City, Missouri, hospital, where about 15% of the youngsters were placed in intensive care, officials said. ""It's worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care. I would call it unprecedented,"" said Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, a director for infectious diseases at Children's Mercy Hospital, where about 475 children were recently treated. ""I've practiced for 30 years in pediatrics, and I've never seen anything quite like this,"" she said. What parents should know about EV-D68 . What's special about this particular type of enterovirus? An analysis by the CDC showed at least 30 of the Kansas City children tested positive for EV-D68, Missouri health officials said. It's a type of enterovirus that's uncommon, but not new. It was first identified in the 1960s and there have been fewer than 100 reported cases since that time. But it's possible, Pallansch said, that the relatively low number of reports might be because EV-D68 is hard to identify. EV-D68 was seen last year in the United States and this year in various parts of the world. Over the years, clusters have been reported in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona and various countries including the Philippines, Japan and the Netherlands. Experts say they don't know why it's flared up this time around. ""Why one virus or another crops up in one part of the country or another part of the country from one year to the next is inexplicable,"" said William Schaffner, head of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University. ""It's a mystery to me."" What are the symptoms? The virus can start as just a cold. Signs include coughing, difficulty breathing and in some cases a rash. Sometimes they can be accompanied by fever or wheezing. Respiratory problems appear to the hallmark of EV-D68, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. ""Most enteroviruses cause either a little bit of a cold or a diarrheal illness -- a few cause meningitis,"" said Schaffner. ""This one is the, if you will, odd cousin. It causes prominent respiratory symptoms. Why it does that, we're really not sure."" How serious is it? The good news is that enteroviruses usually aren't deadly. ""All of these folks are going to get better,"" said Schaffner. ""Some of them have more severe illness, such as these children who have developed asthma and are hospitalized. But they should all get better."" Many of the EV-D68 infections ""will be mild and self-limited, requiring only symptomatic treatment,"" the Missouri health agency said. Some cases could, in theory, contribute to death, but none of the Missouri cases have resulted in death and no data are available for overall morbidity and mortality from the virus in the United States, the agency said. How widespread are the cases? Beyond the surge in infections in Missouri, there are signs of a possible regional outbreak of EV-D68. Colorado, Illinois and Ohio are reporting cases with similar symptoms and are awaiting testing results, according to officials and CNN affiliates in those states. The 10 states that have reached out to the CDC for assistance are Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky. The unusually high number of hospitalizations reported now could be ""just the tip of the iceberg in terms of severe cases,"" said Pallansch of the CDC. What can be done to prevent it? Like other enteroviruses, the respiratory illness appears to spread through close contact with infected people. That makes children more susceptible. There's not a great deal you can do, health officials say, beyond taking commonsense steps to reduce the risk. Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds -- particularly after going to the bathroom and changing diapers. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are regularly touched by different people, such as toys and doorknobs. Avoid shaking hands, kissing, hugging and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick. And stay home if you feel unwell. There's no vaccine for EV-D68.","Enterovirus EV-D68 is uncommon but not new .

"President Barack Obama gave a historic speech on Friday. After months of revelations about the extraordinary surveillance capabilities of the U.S. government -- and the National Security Agency in particular -- the President promised to end the bulk collection of telephone records by the NSA and to put in place new safeguards for privacy protection of U.S. citizens and those outside the country. Let's give Obama credit for signaling a new direction in the ongoing discussion over civil liberties and security. It is a good thing, one that should lead to greater freedom and security. Obama has stopped treating the Snowden revelations as a public relations issue and chose instead to pursue the hard work of reform and new protections. As Obama acknowledged, intelligence collection is necessary to a nation's security, and to all countries in identifying threats. But at some point, programs become too vast, concerns about their direction arise, and changes must be made. Just because the government can do something with technology does not mean it should. Obama also announced the establishment of a public interest advocate at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the body that has authorized the vast surveillance program. The advocate will provide an opportunity for the judges to hear from someone opposed to the surveillance program. Only after hearing both sides of the argument will the judges make a decision. In addition, there are plans to improve oversight of National Security Letters -- a secretive process for obtaining access to business records about customers. ""NSLs"" have become a favorite of the law enforcement community post-9/11 and have caused real concern among civil libertarians across the political spectrum. Obama said notification procedures would be established and there would be more openness. This is not as much as some had hoped, but still it goes further than was expected. Finally, Obama said he would create a new panel to assess the impact of ""Big Data"" on personal privacy. The phrase may be cliché, but the problem is real. Increasingly data -- and also metadata -- reveal an extraordinary amount of personal information. We need a better approach, with technologists and legal scholars, and a deeper engagement from the White House and Congress, to make meaningful progress on this critical issue. Civil libertarians are welcoming Obama's proposals. From the start, we had urged the end of the NSA telephone record program. We had also pushed for reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, more oversight and accountability for government conduct, and a greater willingness to engage a meaningful debate on the impact that technology is having on privacy and freedom. For those outside the United States, the takeaway will be more mixed. Yes, it is good that the U.S. President has agreed to stop listening in on the calls of foreign allies, narrow the focus of the U.S. data collection overseas, and extend legal safeguards to non-U.S. citizens. But still, a larger problem remains for the United States. For many years the United States has pushed aggressively against efforts in other countries to update data protection laws and put in place new privacy safeguards. Washington spent the last several years assuring Europeans that its system of ""self-regulation"" for the private sector coupled with ""vigorous oversight"" of government surveillance provides meaningful protection. The documents released by Edward Snowden tell a very different story -- of insufficient oversight, private sector collaboration, and technologies of surveillance gone largely out of control. In some instances it was clear that the NSA was actually undermining standards necessary for Internet security. Several of the recently released court opinions also suggest that the NSA itself did not know what data it was collecting. It will not be easy to rein in these powers or to fully understand the consequences of the technologies the U.S. government has embraced. In other words, Obama has not said enough yet to assure those outside the United States that the NSA will not continue to monitor their activities. He also did not fully embrace the efforts under way in many countries to strengthen the right to privacy. A relevant historical reference for the President in the surveillance debate is the FBI monitoring of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and U.S. opponents of the war in Vietnam. Today the reality is that the NSA gathers vast amounts of data on political leaders, private firms and human rights campaigners outside the United States. Obama will need to do much more to make clear that intelligence collection is not a blank check to conduct surveillance on other nations. Obama has several opportunities coming up to say more about what he will to do to protect privacy, widely viewed around the world as a fundamental human right. This year the State of the Union falls on January 28, International Privacy Day, a day that marks the creation of the most well-known international framework for privacy protection. The United States should be the world's leader on freedom, not surveillance.","Marc Rotenberg: President gave a historic speech about NSA reforms .

"Trust us, we're from Silicon Valley. America's largest Internet companies are tripping over themselves to bolster their public image following blockbuster disclosures about their role in the U.S. government's controversial data-gathering program. Ever since news reports suggested that major tech firms — including Apple, Google, Facebook and Yahoo — provide the National Security Agency (NSA) with unfettered or ""direct"" access to their servers, the companies have been waging an aggressive campaign to demonstrate that they're not government stooges. Now, several of the top Silicon Valley firms are engaged in a game of one-upmanship to show that they are the most transparent Internet company on the block. The initial reports about ""direct access,"" as part of a classified U.S. intelligence system called Prism, have turned out to be wrong. But the Prism reports have highlighted long-standing privacy fears about how the largest U.S. tech companies handle their vast troves of user data. The Internet giants have come under scrutiny following reports that the NSA uses Prism to examine data — including e-mails, videos and online chats — that it collects via requests made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), one of the controversial laws at the heart of the current NSA-snooping furor. Following the Prism leak, which was supplied to the Guardian and the Washington Post by whistle-blower Edward Snowden, Apple, Google, Facebook and Yahoo all issued statements — in strikingly similar legal language — denying that they give the NSA ""direct"" or unfettered access to their computer servers. But the companies apparently felt the need to go further than those denials, and in recent days have engaged in a competition to demonstrate their commitment to transparency. Although Silicon Valley has roots in the U.S. military — the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency was central to the development of the Internet — today's big tech companies are keen to demonstrate their independence from the government and often display a libertarian streak. Many engineers in Silicon Valley are sympathetic to ""hacker"" culture. Above all, Silicon Valley tech titans are wary of losing the trust of consumers, which could endanger their businesses. These companies are no doubt well aware of the numerous more secure alternatives to their services, some of which enable users to roam the Internet anonymously. Google kicked off the transparency battle last week when it asked U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI Director Robert Mueller for permission to publish ""aggregate numbers of national-security requests, including FISA disclosures — in terms of both the number we receive and their scope."" That request was noteworthy because it was the first time Google had even acknowledged that it receives national-security FISA requests. Facebook and Microsoft quickly followed suit with similar requests. A Department of Justice spokesperson told TIME that the agency is in the process of reviewing the request. Then, over the weekend, Facebook, which unlike Google has never published a transparency report, reached an agreement with the government allowing it to disclose data on U.S. information requests. Facebook said that for the six months ending Dec. 31, 2012, it received between 9,000 and 10,000 data requests, including criminal and national-security-related requests, covering between 18,000 and 19,000 accounts. ""We're pleased that as a result of our discussions, we can now include in a transparency report all U.S. national-security-related requests (including FISA as well as National Security Letters) — which until now no company has been permitted to do,"" Facebook general counsel Ted Ullyot said in a not-so-subtle dig at the company's rivals. Shortly thereafter, Microsoft released similar data, indicating that the company received between 6,000 and 7,000 criminal and national-security requests affecting between 31,000 and 32,000 consumer accounts. ""This only impacts a tiny fraction of Microsoft's global customer base,"" John Frank, Microsoft's deputy general counsel, said in a blog post. ""Transparency alone may not be enough to restore public confidence, but it's a great place to start."" On Monday, Apple joined the party and announced that from Dec. 1, 2012, to May 31, 2013, it received between 4,000 and 5,000 requests from U.S. law enforcement for customer data related to between 9,000 and 10,000 accounts or devices, including both criminal investigations and national-security ""matters."" Apple said it was releasing the data ""in the interest of transparency."" Yahoo followed late Monday, saying it received ""between 12,000 and 13,000 requests, inclusive of criminal, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), and other requests."" Here's the problem. According to the agreement Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Yahoo reached with the government, the companies were only permitted to release aggregate numbers of total U.S. data requests. Crucially, they were not permitted to separately break out the number of FISA requests. For this reason, we don't know if they received 50 FISA requests, 500 or 5,000. As a result, the disclosures, while laudable, skirt around the central issue of the NSA-snooping controversy, which is the nature and extent of the companies' participation in secret U.S. national-security investigations. ""We believe the companies should be allowed to break out specific numbers for FISA requests,"" said Amie Stepanovich, director of the Domestic Surveillance Project at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington-based public-interest organization. ""These numbers would provide nationwide transparency. We also believe that individual users targeted under FISA should receive notice that they were subject to surveillance, even after the fact, so they have the chance to contest the surveillance in court."" For Google, which earlier this year was the first Internet company to disclose requests made for National Security Letters (NSLs) — a separate type of query than FISA requests — the arrangement struck by Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Yahoo was not satisfactory. ""We have always believed that it's important to differentiate between different types of government requests,"" Google said in a statement. ""We already publish criminal requests separately from National Security Letters. Lumping the two categories together would be a step back for users. Our request to the government is clear: to be able to publish aggregate numbers of national-security requests, including FISA disclosures, separately."" Twitter, which was not named in the NSA leak as a participant in the Prism program, quickly threw its support behind Google. ""We agree with Google,"" Benjamin Lee, Twitter's legal director, said in a Twitter message. ""It's important to be able to publish numbers of national-security requests — including FISA disclosures — separately."" Thus, the contours of the transparency battle were drawn. On one side: Facebook, Microsoft and Apple. On the other, Google and Twitter. For their part, Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo said they would continue to urge the government to allow them to be more specific about national-security requests, including FISA requests. Facebook said it would continue ""to push for even more transparency, so that our users around the world can understand how infrequently we are asked to provide user data on national-security grounds."" Microsoft said: ""What we are permitted to publish continues to fall short of what is needed to help the community understand and debate these issues."" But only Google has thus far resisted striking a deal with the government on the disclosure of data requests. On Monday, a Google spokesperson told TIME that the company had no update on its negotiations with the government concerning breaking out FISA requests.","Big Internet companies are tripping over themselves to bolster their public image .

"Tea party favorite and potential 2016 presidential candidate Ben Carson gave President Barack Obama some rare praise for his response to the North Korean cyberattack that threatened the release of a Sony Pictures movie. ""I am proud of the president of the United States for taking a tough stand on this issue,"" Carson, a frequent and no-holds-barred critic of Obama, wrote in a Washington Times opinion piece published late Tuesday. ""It was extremely encouraging to see the United States and Sony eventually stand up to the cyberbullying of the North Koreans by allowing the movie 'The Interview' to be released in theaters around the country despite threats of retaliation."" Carson has slammed Obama in the past for his policies, most recently his stance on race relations in the wake of incidents in Ferguson and New York, and once criticized the direction of the country with Obama just a few feet away. Carson did measure his kudos to the President, adding in the opinion piece that the U.S. response ""should go far beyond proportionality."" Obama had said that the U.S. would respond proportionally to the cyberattack, which the FBI said North Korea was ""responsible"" for. North Korea denied involvement in the Sony hack and instead threatened attacks on ""all the citadels of the U.S. imperialists."" ""The response should go far beyond proportionality, and an example should be made of the perpetrators by using a host of available options to inflict the kind of punishment that will not be easily forgotten,"" Carson wrote, adding that he believes the U.S. ""appears to be a paper tiger"" and is less respected and feared around the world. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), who is also considering a 2016 presidential run, also gave Obama a rare kudos in an interview with CNN's State of the Union published Sunday. ""So far so good, Mr. President,"" Graham said.

"Two prominent Muslim civil liberties groups called for Police Commissioner Ray Kelly to resign on Thursday because of his participation in a film that they say paints all Muslims as terrorists. ""Involvement with 'Third Jihad' sends a clear message that the NYPD's dealings with New York's diverse Muslim communities are based on bigotry and blanket suspicion,"" the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) stated in a press release. Muslim activists say ""The Third Jihad,"" a documentary about radical Islam, vilifies the American Muslim community and teaches police officers to suspect Muslims as terrorists. Muslim activists are also calling for Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne to resign, saying that he first denied and only later admitted that Kelly was interviewed for the film. ""They were not telling the truth about their involvement in the propaganda film against Muslims,"" said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), adding that New York ""deserves people they trust who do not discriminate against people."" The film's producer, Ralphael Shore, released a written statement defending the film stating that the film accurately portrays radical Islam: . ""Those that have blasted the film are attempting to stifle an important debate about the internal state of the Muslim community in America, and whether politicized Islam and indoctrination pose tangible security threats,"" Shore said in the statement. According to documents obtained by New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, the film was screened during an NYPD terrorism training course that more than 1,000 police officers attended. In a statement released Wednesday night, Kelly acknowledged that he had been interviewed for the film five years ago by a filmmaker and, ""while it never became part of the Department's curriculum, and was not authorized for any training,"" the film had been screened ""for an extended period in 2010"" in a room where officers were on break from training. According to the statement, the screening stopped after an officer who was offended by it brought it to department officials' attention. ""I offer my apologies to members of the Muslim community, in particular, who would find the film inflammatory and its airing on Department property, though unauthorized, to be inappropriate,"" Kelly said. Awad said the police commissioner's apology was not enough. ""It's not personal, but from our standpoint, our trust in the police chief has been eroded,"" the CAIR leader said. ""He needs to resign.""","Activists say ""The Third Jihad"" vilifies the Muslim-American community .

"The name Ed Hardy conjures visions of rhinestone-studded trucker hats, colorful cartoon skulls, dragons and koi fish, and reality stars like Jon Gosselin and the cast of Jersey Shore. A profitable licensing deal with French businessman Christian Audigier put Hardy's work on clothing, energy drinks, fragrances and even tanning lotions. It seemed like the deal of a lifetime, but in hindsight, Hardy said, the agreement made his name synonymous with the ""douches"" of pop culture and ultimately cheapened his personal brand. Now, he is stepping out from behind the large shadow of the Ed Hardy brand to set the record straight in ""Wear Your Dreams:  My Life in Tattoos,"" a memoir released in June. Co-written with biographer Joel Selvin, the book shares how Hardy went from college-educated fine artist to tattoo pioneer to one of the most polarizing brands in recent memory. ""People began globally to know my images, my name and my signature, but they didn't know there was a real person behind it,"" Hardy told CNN. From skin to canvas . Donald Edward Hardy was born in Newport Beach, California, and his mother began to encourage him to draw when he was 3. As a preteen, he took pens and colored pencils to the skin of neighborhood friends and became an amateur tattoo artist in his neighborhood. He had his first exhibition at the Laguna Beach Art Festival after graduating high school and attended the San Francisco Art Institute. After turning down a graduate position at the Yale School of Art, according to his memoir, he met and began a correspondence with famed tattoo artist ""Sailor Jerry"" Collins in 1969. He went on to study in Japan with legendary tattoo artist Horihide, working with clients from the infamous yakuza, or Japanese mafia. Both men influenced the heraldic aesthetic that defines Hardy's signature ornate images today. He opened his San Francisco tattoo shop, Tattoo City, in 1977 and is credited with helping transform tattooing from a mark of sailors and prisoners to a mainstream option for self-expression. His 1995 gallery show, ""Pierced Hearts and True Love: A Century of Drawings in Tattoos,"" prompted a New York Times article that asked whether tattooing could be fine art. CNN Health: Understand the risks and precautions of tattoos . Hardy's forays into clothing started with silkscreen shirts bearing his artwork for sale in his shop. In 2003, the artist was approached by two men who saw his work in Juxtapoz art magazine. The two ran Ku USA, an Asian-influenced casual wear brand, and they became the first to put Hardy's images on clothing. French fashion businessman Christian Audigier came across the shirts and approached Hardy to do a licensing deal that would make him ""a global phenomenon,"" Hardy wrote in the book. Hardy said he and an associate met Audigier and signed over the master license to much of his artwork, allowing Audigier to produce items featuring the images. This deal turned out to be enormously profitable. By 2009, sales exceeded $700 million for the brand, according to the book, and Hardy's work could soon be seen everywhere. The brand's omnipresence was enhanced by famous fans. At its height, Ed Hardy clothing could be seen on celebrities from Madonna and Catherine Zeta Jones to cast members of ""Jersey Shore"" and Jon Gosselin of the ""Jon and Kate Plus 8"" reality show. Gosselin infamously donned Ed Hardy-printed shirts in public appearances with alleged mistress Hailey Glassman, and visited France to meet with Audigier. Hardy said the character associations ruined the brand's reputation, and even wrote in the book that a Macy's buyer mentioned Gosselin when the line was dropped from Macy's stores. Hardy had no problem saying, ""Morons dehumanized it,"" when asked about his views on public distaste of the Ed Hardy brand. He maintained that the clothes and imagery were not to blame for the brand's downfall, but pointed to Audigier's aggressive love of celebrities, which Hardy said tainted his image and his name. According to the book, Audigier pocketed a lot of the profits that came from sub-licensing Hardy's images to several companies that produced lifestyle-related products, and even began altering the images. The two soon landed in court, and the tattoo artist found himself spending time perusing legal documents instead of creating art until an undisclosed settlement was reached in 2009. Attempts to reach Christian Audigier were unsuccessful. From must-have to must-hate . Simon Doonan, creative ambassador-at-large for Barney's New York, surprised many by praising the Ed Hardy line in the New York Observer in 2009. ""Criticizing Ed Hardy for being cheesy is like saying that Elvis was 'flashy' or that Liberace was 'tacky,' "" Doonan wrote. ""It's a giant case of DUH! Of course it's cheesy! That's the whole point, you doo-doo heads. Ed Hardy is fromage-y and hedonistic and naughty and badass and—the ultimate crime in the world of haute fashion—Ed Hardy is FUN!"" Doonan compared the rise of Hardy clothing to ""the gaudy heyday of Gianni Versace."" So why would people buy something ""fromage-y"" like Ed Hardy apparel? ""It gave regular people Hollywood edge, and gave Hollywood people street edge,"" celebrity stylist Phillip Bloch said. Today, however, the brand ""represents bad taste,"" he said. ""It went too far and all over the place at once."" This could explain why there's a ""Hating people who wear Ed Hardy"" Facebook group with more than 1,800 members, and a Funnyordie.com sketch titled ""The Ed Hardy Boyz"" with less-than-likeable characters who go on misadventures to protect the Ed Hardy brand name from rival clothing lines. The blog Stuff White People Like lists ""Hating people who wear Ed Hardy"" as item 124. A New Orleans nightclub even banned the line, with a sign on its door that read ""If it's on Jersey Shore it's not coming through the door: No Affliction, No Ed Hardy, No Christian Audigier, No Exceptions."" Hardy said he thought partnering with Audigier would give him time to work on his art. He didn't expect success and the infamy it eventually created. Celebrity fashion labels: the good, the bad and the ugly . ""Oversaturation and overexposure"" can kill a brand, said Tom Julian, director at The Doneger Group, a fashion retail and consulting company. Popular brands can quickly fall from grace if their public exposure isn't strategically managed. Answering the ""many entities that knock on the door"" can be bad for business, Julian said, noting that designers may choose to wait five or more years before signing licensing deals, because it allows them to be strategic with market penetration. Hardy said Audigier's widespread licensing aspired to make the brand more accessible to people at every price point. That strategy backfired, as the brand became what Bloch described as ""very trailer park."" ""They made it too unexclusive,"" he said. ""No one wants to be in something that everyone has."" Both Bloch and Julian said the brand would have to wait several years before a successful comeback is tangible. Hardy noted that the master license was taken on by Iconix Brand Group in 2011, which also represents the London Fog brand and Madonna's Material Girl line. The group has plans to develop the label, which Hardy said is still popular in Asia and other countries. The stories behind your favorite fashions . Back to the drawing board . Though he completed his last tattoo in 2008, Hardy is still an active artist who splits his time between San Francisco and Honolulu and mentors artists of Tattoo City, now run by his son, Doug. This month, he'll travel to Beijing to show a 30-painting exhibition of his original artwork. Although Hardy said he might have done things differently if given the chance, he also admitted that it was surreal to see his name and art become so well-known. With this memoir, Hardy aims to convince the public that despite the infamy of his eponymous brand, he is and has always been an artist.","Ed Hardy, the tattoo artist behind popular clothing line of the same name, released memoir in June .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN)Two weeks after the United States and Cuba agreed to thaw decades of icy relations, the U.S. State Department blasted the Cuban government for reportedly arresting at least six dissidents. There was no comment from Cuban authorities on the arrests that were reported by other dissidents and the U.S. State Department. ""We are deeply concerned about the latest reports of detentions and arrests by Cuban authorities of peaceful civil society members and activists,"" State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said in a statement. Roberta Jacobson, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs, wrote Tuesday on Twitter that ""Freedom of expression remains core of U.S. policy on ‪Cuba, we support activists exercising those rights and condemn today's detentions."" Jacobson is expected to travel to Havana in January to lead U.S. efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, U.S. government officials had previously said. The reported detentions came after a Cuban performance artist called for an open forum to demand changes from the country's single-party communist government. The event was due to take place in Havana's revolution square, the central plaza usually reserved for speeches from Fidel and Raul Castro and visiting dignitaries like Pope John Paul II. Cuban dissidents said the artist, Tania Bruguera, well-known for pushing the limits of freedom of expression in Cuba, was also arrested before the protest could begin. Bruguera had tried to convince Cuban officials to allow the event to go forward but on Tuesday the government-run union for artists and writers released a statement calling her proposal a ""political provocation"" meant to derail improving U.S.-Cuban relations. Government critic and blogger Yoani Sanchez wrote that she supported the event but on Tuesday tweeted that she was under house arrest and her husband had been taken away by police. CNN saw a police car and two uniformed police officers, as well as at least two men in civilian clothes who appeared to be security agents, outside the building where Sanchez lives on Tuesday. No one answered her door when the CNN crew tried to reach her for comment. Cubans have limited access to the Internet and despite a social media campaign to raise awareness about the event, the protest never materialized Tuesday. On December 17, Cuba released U.S. contractor Alan Gross, who'd been held since 2009 for smuggling satellite equipment onto the island. His freedom was part of a landmark deal paving the way for a major overhaul in U.S. policy toward Cuba. Cuba also freed a Cuban double agent who had worked as a U.S. intelligence source and who'd been held for more than 20 years, although authorities did not identify that person for security reasons. For its part, the United States released three of five Cuban intelligence agents convicted of espionage in 2001.","The United States and Cuba exchanged prisoners two weeks ago .

"Airport body scanners that produce graphic images of travelers' bodies will be removed from checkpoints by June, the Transportation Security Administration says, ending what critics called ""virtual strip searches."" Passengers will continue to pass through machines that display a generic outline of the human body, raising fewer privacy concerns. The TSA move came after Rapiscan, the manufacturer of the 174 so-called ""backscatter"" machines, acknowledged it could not meet a congressional-ordered deadline to install privacy software on the machines. ""It is big news,"" said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ""It removes the concern that people are being viewed naked by the TSA screener."" In 2004 and 2005, the TSA at first dismissed privacy concerns, then sought to address them by placing TSA officers viewing the scanner imagery in remote locations, away from the passenger being screened. They also gave passengers the right to an alternative screening -- a pat down. Speedier trip through airport security could come within a decade . But those solutions failed to appease privacy groups and some members of Congress, who felt both alternatives could be abused. Ultimately, a problem caused by technology was solved by technology. Security companies developed privacy software, called Automated Target Recognition (ATR) software. But while manufacturers of the less-intrusive ""millimeter wave"" machines found ways to use ATR software, backscatter machines have not. This week, the TSA announced it is ending its contract with Rapiscan ""due to its inability to deploy non-imaging ATR software."" How much do we really hate the TSA? ""By June 2013 travelers will only see machines which have ATR that allow for faster throughput. This means faster lanes for the traveler and enhanced security,"" the TSA said in a statement. The TSA could allow backscatter machines in the future if the company develops the required software, the TSA said. Currently, the TSA uses the 174 backscatter machines in 30 airports, and has another 76 units in storage. It uses millimeter wave machines in 170 airports. The decision to remove the backscatter machine will make moot, at least temporarily, travelers' concerns about the health effects of the machines. Backscatter machines use X-rays, while millimeter wave machines use radio waves. The TSA has long maintained both machines are safe, but recently signed an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to study the scanners. The study will continue even though the machines are being pulled, the TSA said, because they could be reintroduced in the future. 2013 travel: Wishes for smooth journeys .","TSA is removing certain body scanning machines .

"As many as 86 Atlanta-based workers for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may have been unintentionally exposed to anthrax, the agency says. This includes people who have come forward since the announcement Thursday, saying they were in the area during the time of exposure. The workers are being monitored or provided antibiotics. ""Based on most of the potential exposure scenarios, the risk of infection is very low,"" the agency said in a statement. ""CDC believes that other CDC staff, family members, and the general public are not at risk of exposure and do not need to take any protective action."" As of Thursday afternoon, the agency's Occupational Health Clinic had seen 54 employees identified to have been in the labs or hallways at the time of exposure, according to CDC spokesman Tom Skinner. Of the 54 who have already been seen, Skinner said only two chose not to take oral antibiotic treatment. In addition to taking antibiotics to ward off any possible anthrax infection, the CDC says 27 staffers have received the anthrax vaccine. Skinner says remaining identified employees, who have not yet been evaluated at their clinic, are scheduled to be seen Friday. Early reports show that a lab did not adequately inactivate samples, which were then moved and used for experimentation in three laboratories not equipped to handle live Bacillus anthracis, or anthrax. Believing the samples were inactivated, workers in those labs did not don adequate protective equipment, the CDC said. The unintentional exposure was discovered on June 13. What to know about anthrax . Sometime between then and June 6, procedures in two of the three labs may have aerosolized the spores, the CDC said. Hallway and lab areas were decontaminated. There are three types of anthrax infection: cutaneous (through the skin), inhalation (through the lungs) and gastrointestinal (through digestion). Early symptoms can suggest the flu. ""In the worst-case scenarios, literally, within a day or two of exposure, if you've inhaled spores and if they are very lethal, one begins to get -- as they say -- the standard flu symptoms -- high fever, malaise,"" said Leonard Cole, a bioterrorism expert. ""You get lazy. You feel sick. You get headaches. You get bone aches. ""And then after a day or two, in the worst case, if you don't get treatment, it could be lethal for you, and beyond treatment,"" he said. The CDC said disciplinary action, as necessary, will be taken. The agency will review safety protocol with employees. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is aware of the incident and coordinating with officials at the CDC as they investigate, said FBI spokesman Christopher Allen. ""It is CDC's obligation to ensure that people feel safe and are safe in the workplace and the community as we conduct our life-saving laboratory work. We will report findings of this investigation and all steps we take to improve lab-safety processes as a result of this incident,"" the agency's statement said.","As many as 86 Atlanta CDC workers may have been exposed to anthrax .

"Asiana Airlines is considering legal action against an Oakland television station and the National Transportation Safety Board after an intern at the agency mistakenly confirmed ""inaccurate and offensive"" names as those of the pilots of ill-fated Flight 214. The bogus names that phonetically spelled out phrases such as ""Something Wrong"" and ""We Too Low"" were read during KTVU's noon broadcast on Friday. ""Regarding the KTVU-TV's demeaning report of the pilots on July 12, Asiana Airlines is reviewing possible legal action against KTVU-TV and the NTSB,"" the airline said in a statement. It noted the reputation of the pilots and the company had been ""seriously damaged"" by the report. The safety board, which is investigating last week's runway crash in San Francisco that killed three people and injured more than 180 others, did not address Asiana's potential legal concerns directly. ""The NTSB remains focused on the important investigative work being done to determine what caused Asiana Airlines Flight 214 to crash so that we can make safety recommendations to prevent it from happening again,"" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said in a statement late on Sunday. Both KTVU and the NTSB previously apologized for the embarrassment. ""Nothing is more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and integrity, and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of error does not happen again,"" KTVU posted on its website. Nantel said previously the names were presented by the station to the intern for confirmation. It was not immediately clear who produced the fake names, but the NTSB said it was not the intern, who was not identified. Asiana identified the pilot at the controls of the Boeing 777 that undershot its approach and clipped a sea wall before crash-landing on the runway as Lee Kang-Kuk.

"Working inside Donetsk presents various challenges as a photojournalist. One of them is working directly with rebel forces defending one of their last bastions against government forces. Each day their defensive perimeter shrinks due to constant shelling. Journalists need to acquire proper accreditation given and approved by the Donetsk People's Republic. The funeral series of photos is both rare and hard to come by, as the rebels typically don't give access to the kind of events which show their military losses. If you're a reporter or anybody from the press you have to apply to get two different ID cards from the rebels. One is more general; it allows you to go through checkpoints. It's like an official accreditation. The second one is supposed to allow you to photograph military areas -- although in practice it's up to the discretion of the local military commander and usually they're friendly but they'll say 'no.' We suspect the document is also a good way to control us and the info we provide to the world, by checking the internet. This accreditation also carries another risk -- if you're in Ukrainian Army-controlled areas and they see that, they'll probably arrest you ... because it's official documentation from the ""Donetsk People's Republic."" Nonetheless, we have both, so every time we go through checkpoints, the rebels check our car and they ask for our accreditation and we show them these documents and they let us through. In this case, while driving with our fixer on the road we passed a convoy of rebel cars and two armored vehicles each carrying troops and two coffins. We decided to follow it and try our luck. After a mile, a car from the convoy stopped us, pointed its machine gun at us and asked why we were following them. We explained to them that we wanted to follow the funeral. For some reason they agreed. We drove another 20 minutes to a small village on the front lines - you could hear the constant shelling as government forces were nearby. For an hour we photographed the entire ceremony, only to be arrested as it ended under the pretext that the rebel's faces were shown and some lived nearby. They put us in different cars, drove us to their headquarters in Donetsk, and forced us to delete all the photos. Which we did. But back at the hotel we managed to retrieve all of them. There are unique moments -- it was very personal for them, they were crying. It was quite powerful.

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)At least 15 people were killed and several homes burnt on Tuesday when Boko Haram gunmen raided a village in northern Nigeria near the town of Chibok, according to fleeing residents and a military officer. Boko Haram rebels drew international condemnation when they kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok in April, many of whom they said they sold into slavery. In the latest raid, scores of Boko Haram fighters armed with guns and petrol bombs stormed the remote farming village of Kautikari on motorcycles early Tuesday, shooting randomly and torching homes. The attackers urged residents not to flee, saying they were in the village to find selected targets. ""The gunmen killed 15 people, mostly youth vigilantes who keep watch on the village against Boko Haram attacks,"" said Adamu Kolomgunna,‎ who fled the village for the town of Maiduguri. The attackers hurled petrol bombs into homes‎, causing fire that destroyed several houses, he said. ""The village has been deserted by all able-bodied men, leaving only the old and children,"" Kolomgunna said. The gunmen left the village after the raid, warning residents not to stand in their way when they carry out attacks, said Silas Bitrus, another resident who gave a similar death toll. This was the second deadly raid on Kautikari by Boko Haram insurgents in recent months. On June 29, Boko Haram gunmen dressed as soldiers opened fire on a church in the village during Sunday Mass, killing nine worshipers in an attack in which the militants again burnt several homes. Only two weeks ago, Boko Haram insurgents kidnapped at least 185 women and children and killed 32 people in a raid on another village near Chibok, called Gumsuri, local officials said. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. Violence has increased sharply in recent months, ahead of elections due in February. The Islamist group -- considered one of the world's most deadly terrorist organizations -- has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.","Fighters arrived on motorcycles, torched homes and killed young men -- resident .

"Democrats are looking to turn up the heat on Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy as he heads into the final days of his runoff battle with Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu with two ethics complaints focused on his work at Louisiana State University. Both a Louisiana citizen affiliated with the Louisiana Democratic Party and the American Democracy Legal Fund filed complaints with the Office of Congressional Ethics on Wednesday alleging that Cassidy's work for the university violates multiple ethics rules and guidelines and calling for an investigation. The ADLF complaint, obtained by CNN, alleges that Cassidy failed to receive required approval from the Ethics Committee to engage in teaching activities from 2011-2014. Lawmakers are banned from receiving any ""honoraria"" — meaning a payment for an appearance, speech or article — while serving in office, but teaching activities are exempt from that ban. The complaint against Cassidy also argues that his work for LSU did not meet the requirements to be considered teaching work, and thus wasn't exempt from the ban. Instead, it argues, his work amounts essentially to ""medical services,"" and so the stipend he received from LSU for his teaching services should be considered compensation in violation of Ethics rules. That stipend was also, the complaint alleges, inappropriately left off of his personal disclosure forms. And it also argues that Cassidy received compensation from LSU for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the $100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. The LDP complaint outlines similar concerns. Cassidy's campaign did not respond to a request for comment. It's an effort from Democrats to highlight a late-breaking controversy surrounding Cassidy's employment with the school. Documents published last week by a number of local Louisiana political blogs suggest Cassidy might have billed the school for more hours of work than he completed. Cassidy and his campaign advisers have pushed back against the allegations, arguing they're entirely baseless and simply an effort from Landrieu's campaign to try overcome some of the deep deficit she faces in the polls. She's considered a serious underdog in Saturday's showdown. Landrieu's campaign has vehemently denied that it had anything to do with the documents coming to light, but Bob Mann, an LSU professor and veteran Louisiana political reporter, told CNN on Tuesday he had heard from multiple news outlets in Louisiana that Democratic operatives had been shopping the documents around for at least a month, and found no takers. He said despite the continuing developments in the situation, he thought it was too late in the race for it to change the tide. ""It's one of those things that I think just happened a little too late to really make a difference. It almost feels like last-minute desperation kind of stuff,"" he said.","Rep.

"The U.S. government has transferred five more Guantanamo Bay detainees, shrinking the number to 127. The detainees, two Yemeni and three Tunisians, were repatriated to Kazakhstan, after the Guantanamo Review Task Force said it determined the men did not pose security threats. The Defense Department identified the men as Asim Thabit Abdullah Al-Khalaqi, Muhammad Ali Husayn Khanayna, Sabri Muhammad Ibrahim Al Qurashi, Adel Al-Hakeemy, and Abdullah Bin Ali Al-Lufti. The move advances President Barack Obama's goal of drawing down the number of those held at the U.S. naval base in southeastern Cuba, something that has been ongoing for years. The departures of the five men means that 127 people are still detained at Guantanamo. This is down significantly from the numbers soon after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when the facility widely known as Gitmo was repurposed to hold detainees from the ""war on terror."" The administration of then-President George W. Bush claimed that, since Gitmo detainees weren't held on American soil, they could be considered ""enemy combatants"" and be denied some legal protections. Almost all of the nearly 800 detainees were held without charges. This legal limbo, as well as allegations of torture and other mistreatment, spurred criticism of Gitmo. Shortly after his 2009 inauguration, President Barack Obama signed an executive order to close the detention facility within a year. That didn't happen. One reason was because of strong opposition from lawmakers, many of them Republicans, who cited the risk of freeing men who had fought to kill Americans. About 17% of the 620 Gitmo detainees released -- most of them during Bush's presidency -- went on to engage in terrorist activities, a September semiannual report from the director of national intelligence found. Another 12% are suspected of having engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities.","Two Yemenis and three Tunisians transferred .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. health system has been preparing since late March for the news we announced Tuesday: the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the United States. In this age of global travel, we anticipated that a traveler from a country with an Ebola outbreak would come to the United States and develop symptoms once they arrived. But from everything we know now, there appears to be no risk that anyone on this patient's flights from Liberia to the United States was exposed to the virus. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? Clinicians on the front lines have been one key to our safety: identifying patients with both a history of travel and symptoms indicating they might have Ebola, immediately isolating them, consulting their local or state health departments, and getting the patients tested as needed. Indeed, since the outbreak began in Africa, CDC has consulted with state and local health departments on almost 100 cases in which travelers had recently returned from West Africa and showed symptoms that might have been caused by Ebola. Of those cases, 14 were considered to be truly at risk. Specimens from 13 were tested and Ebola was ruled out in all 13 cases. But now CDC labs have confirmed our nation's first U.S.-diagnosed Ebola patient. I understand this can be deeply troubling news, especially after what we have witnessed Ebola do in West Africa. But there are distinct differences in what will happen here. The United States has a strong health care system and dedicated public health professionals -- all hard at work right now -- to make sure this case will not threaten the community at large, or the nation. A person who is sick from Ebola virus disease can be cared for in U.S. hospitals when the patient is isolated in a private room with a private bathroom and contact with them is highly controlled. Every health care worker must meticulously follow every single infection control protection we recommend. How the Ebola virus spreads . Public health officials, meanwhile, are also identifying people who have had close personal contact with the newly diagnosed patient and will follow up with them for 21 days, the longest known incubation period for Ebola. If they develop any signs of the disease, those people will be isolated, tested and cared for. The fact is that CDC has been preparing for this day, working around the clock with local and state health departments to enhance surveillance and laboratory testing capacity, provide recommendations for health care infection control and other measures to prevent disease spread, and deliver guidance and tools for health departments to conduct public health investigations. Your Ebola questions answered . I'm not going to promise that we can stop this at just one case, but I can tell you we have the advantage because the right steps are being taken, and I am therefore confident we will stop Ebola in its tracks here in the United States. And there is one final thing to remember, even as the first case here grabs the headlines: We must be relentless in stopping its spread in West Africa.

"(CNN) -- The shooting deaths of four mountain gorillas -- three females and an alpha male silverback -- are prompting a United Nations agency to send a mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Park rangers found the three females and an alpha male silverback earlier this week. Rangers made the gruesome find in the southern sector of Virunga National Park earlier this week, said Flora and Fauna International, an organization that acts to conserve threatened species and ecosystems. The group said it is unclear who shot the gorillas or why. ""Just over 700 mountain gorillas survive in the wild today, and none exist in captivity,"" Flora and Fauna International said in a statement. ""For such a small population, the unnecessary and indiscriminate killing of four mountain gorillas is a huge loss."" The U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) said Friday it will send a mission to the site as soon as possible ""to provide support to those fighting to preserve the integrity of Virunga National Park."" The agency said it will try to find out the reasons behind the slayings and work with Congolese authorities and the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation to prevent future deaths. The females, named Safari, Neeza and Mburanumwe, and the male, Rugendo, were shot Sunday night, UNESCO said. They belonged to a group that was frequently visited by tourists, providing an economic boon to the area. ""The situation threatens to become an ecological and economic disaster for the neighboring local communities,"" the agency said in a statement. The chief executive of Flora and Fauna International expressed deep concern about the killings, which he said follow more than 20 years of successful collaboration for mountain gorilla conservation. ""Whatever the motive underlying this tragedy, the gorillas are helpless pawns in a feud between individuals,"" Mark Rose said. The death of Rugendo could have a ripple effect, the organization said. ""Alpha males fulfill a leadership role within a group, and in their absence the integrity of the group is often compromised."" Rugendo's group contained 12 gorillas before he was killed, the group said. Now, six have been found safe, but two -- a female and an infant -- are missing. Seven gorillas have been killed in the park so far this year, Flora and Fauna International said. At least two of them were believed killed by supporters of rebel leader Gen. Laurent Nkunda, Flora and Fauna International said. The skin of one was found in a latrine in a nearby rebel camp. The infant of another female gorilla is being hand-raised by the nature conservation institute, which oversees the Democratic Republic of Congo's wildlife and protected areas. Nkunda's rebels have been fighting government troops in the eastern part of the country for several years. Conservation institute patrols were increased in the park's southern sector with support from the DRC army, the organization said, and guard posts are being built to enable 24-hour park surveillance. The bodies of the four gorillas will undergo post-mortem examinations, Flora and Fauna International said, and will be buried near Bukima, a park outpost. ""Just two months ago, we celebrated the increase of the gorilla population in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda,"" said Kwame Koranteng, a regional representative of the World Wildlife Fund's Eastern Africa Regional Program Office, in the Flora and Fauna statement.

"(CNN)  -- A man walks into a thrift store. A New Zealand man finds confidential U.S. military files on a used MP3 player he bought at a thrift store for $9. It sounds like the opening line to a bad joke. And this case was a bad joke -- for the Pentagon. Chris Ogle of New Zealand was in Oklahoma about a year ago when he bought a used MP3 player from a thrift store for $9. A few weeks ago, he plugged it into his computer to download a song, and he instead discovered confidential U.S. military files. ""The more I look at it, the more I see, and the less I think I should be,"" Ogle said with a nervous laugh in an interview with TVNZ. The files included the home addresses, Social Security numbers and cell phone numbers of U.S. soldiers. The player also included what appeared to be mission briefings and lists of equipment deployed to hot spots in Afghanistan and Iraq. Most of the information appears to date to 2005. The New Zealand journalist who first reported the story was able to contact at least one of the soldiers by dialing a phone number found in the files. He hung up once she explained why she was calling.  Watch how man discovered secret military files » . Pentagon officials told CNN that they are aware of the MP3 player, but can't talk about it until investigators confirm that the information came from the U.S. Department of Defense.

Despite government efforts to protect sensitive information, this is a growing problem, privacy experts say. Two years ago, the Department of Veterans Affairs lost track of a laptop with the personal information of millions of soldiers. And computer hard drives with classified military information have been found for sale at street markets in Afghanistan. ""When you can identify American personnel, when you have their names, their home address, their cell phone numbers, you put people in a dangerous position,"" Rotenberg said. In this case, the personal information for several hundred soldiers landed in friendly hands. Ogle told CNN the MP3 player is being kept in a safe place and he will happily turn it over to U.S. military officials if they ask for it.","New Zealander finds confidential U.S. military files on a used MP3 player .

"Pripyat, Ukraine (CNN) -- There's an eerie stillness about the desolate buildings and empty streets of Pripyat. From the main square, overgrown with brambles and wild grass, the town looks like an ancient ruin lost in a jungle. Buildings, windows smashed, stand like monolithic giants peering down. On one, an unlit neon sign saying ""restaurant"" clings onto a rooftop. From another, a hammer and sickle looms over the scene below. I can't think of a single place I've visited that feels so utterly abandoned and lost. The order to evacuate Pripyat came too late. It had been 36 hours since an explosion in Reactor 4 at Chernobyl, on April 26, 1986, had spewed its radioactive debris over the town. Fearing panic, the then Soviet authorities, under Mikhail Gorbachev, ordered Pripyat's citizens to continue life as normal. So, as the world's worst nuclear accident wreaked havoc, searing with radiation all in its path, children in this town went to school and sat through lessons. Couples got married. When the evacuation did get under way, once the scale of disaster could no longer be denied, residents were told they would be back in a few days. They took nothing with them -- just documents, some money and some food for the bus ride. Even inside the Soviet Union, the disgraceful way the situation was handled by the authorities was severely criticized. On several occasions since, Gorbachev -- remembered for his perestroika and glasnost reforms -- said he believed Chernobyl was equally responsible for bringing about the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even 25 years on, the problem of Chernobyl has far from gone away. There is considerable debate over how many people died, and how many are still dying, as a result of the calamity. The International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organization say 28 emergency workers died of radiation sickness in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. About 20 more who received high doses of radiation died of various causes in the following years, and as many as 4,000 cancer deaths are expected as a result of the disaster, according to those U.N. agencies. The Chernobyl Union of Ukraine, which supports survivors of the disaster, says 140,000 people who took part in the cleanup have died in the past quarter-century. But it is not clear how many of those fell victim to radiation. Meanwhile, researchers say that in addition to spikes in certain types of cancers, there is evidence of severe anxiety among survivors. Ukraine's government says an area larger than Switzerland was affected, and a 30-km (19-mile) radius around the plant remains all but uninhabited. And the impact is unlikely to diminish anytime soon. Nuclear disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima don't run on a human timeline. Limited numbers of tourists are allowed into the accident zone for brief visits, despite radiation being well above normal, but scientists say generations may pass before it is entirely safe for people to return.","Ukrainian city remains a ghost town 25 years after Chernobyl .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Marshals Service is confirming that it has stored more than 35,000 ""whole body"" images of people who had entered a U.S. courthouse in Orlando, Florida. The images captured by millimeter wave technology are more ghost-like and far less detailed than those produced by ""backscatter"" machines commonly used by the Transportation Security Administration at airports nationwide. But the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy rights group that obtained the Marshals Service photos, said the disclosure shows that body imaging machines can store intrusive images of people's bodies and that the federal government will store images in the absence of strong judicial or legislative restraints. The center and other privacy groups filed suit against the TSA this year, asking the court to bar it from using body imagers at airports. The disclosure about the U.S. Marshals Service storing images came this week in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from the Electronic Privacy Information Center. In a letter to the center, Justice Department attorneys agreed to give 100 images of the approximately 35,314 images that were stored on the Orlando courthouse machine from February 2 until July 28. It called the 100 images a ""representative sample"" of stored images. A U.S. Marshals Office spokeswoman said the Brijot Gen2 machine in Orlando automatically stores the images to a hard drive, and security officers can look at an image of the person who just entered the machine and the two previous images. But all other images can only be accessed via an administrative passcode, spokeswoman Carolyn Gwathmey said. Gwathmey said the stored images had never been accessed before the receipt of the Freedom of Information Act request. Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center conceded that the Marshals Service's images are ""not particularly revealing"" but said this experience highlights the necessity for prohibitions on government's use of backscatter technology, which can capture far more revealing images by using X-rays to provide detailed images in or under a person's clothing. ""The only thing that is preventing the TSA from [storing images] is that we keep raising this with them,"" Rotenberg said. In written comments this year to CNN, the TSA said images at airports ""cannot be stored, transmitted or printed"" when in normal operations. ""TSA has clearly demonstrated the extensive steps and strict measures that have been taken to protect passenger privacy,"" the agency said. The images released to the Electronic Privacy Information Center were captured by a machine at the Middle District of Florida in the Orlando courthouse. The Marshals Service also tested a machine at a U.S. courthouse in Washington for about 90 days in the 2007 and 2008 time frame, Gwathmey said. During the test, the machine was not used to screen individuals entering the courthouse, she said. That machine was returned to the vendor, and any images that may have been stored on it are no longer under agency control, the Justice Department said.","The Marshals Service used millimeter wave technology to collect images .

"Controversial plans by Iceland's government to try to limit access to pornography online and in print to protect children have sparked international opposition. Free speech campaigners, activists and academics are among the 40 individuals and groups from some 20 countries who've signed an open letter urging Icelandic Interior Minister Ogmundur Jonasson to drop the proposal. The letter was coordinated and published online Thursday by the International Modern Media Institute, an Icelandic civil society think tank headed by lawmaker and ex-Wikileaks spokeswoman Birgitta Jonsdottir. It claims the proposal has ""already jeopardized longstanding efforts to prevent or abolish censorship in totalitarian regimes and protect civil liberties and human rights worldwide."" Read more: In the tech world, porn quietly leads the way . ""Iceland is a liberal democratic state which should not serve as a role model for Internet censorship,"" the letter said. Restricting people's access to information online in order to shape their views is as much censorship as the repression of free speech, it said, drawing a comparison with the governments of Iran, North Korea and China. The technology used by Iceland to restrict access to online pornography would be no different from that used by totalitarian regimes, the letter said, and would require automatic surveillance of all telecommunications. Read more: Does Twitter's Vine have a porn problem? The letter also warns that blocking pornographic content online ""may create demand for an underground porn industry, unregulated and most certainly affiliated with other illegal activities,"" such as has been seen in efforts to ban alcohol or illegal drugs. Iceland's laws already ban the making and distribution of pornography but were written before the advent of the Internet, which has made access much easier. Read more: Child pornography ushers Internet censorship into Australia . Halla Gunnarsdottir, an adviser to the interior minister, told the UK's Guardian newspaper that the government's goal is not censoring sex but restricting access to violent pornography. Research has shown that children in Iceland are on average 11 years old when they're first exposed to pornography, she said, with some traumatized by it and others later seeking to re-enact violent acts they have seen. The government's plans include tightening the current legal definition of pornography to differentiate between sex and violent or degrading material, she told the newspaper. But the activists' letter argues that ""the Internet is not the source of violence, it is merely a medium by which violence is made apparent."" App stores: Gatekeepers, or censors of the mobile Web? If Iceland's government wants to protect children from learning about sex on the Internet, it should focus on improving sex education in homes and schools, it said. Among the U.S. signatories to the letter are the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Center for Civic Media at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Other signatories hail from as far afield as Egypt, Jordan, Guatemala, India, Germany and the United Kingdom. Iceland, a nation of nearly 320,000 people, is better known for its efforts to promote free speech and transparency than for any censorship. Its parliament in 2010 backed a proposal drafted by the International Modern Media Institute for the adoption of new laws to strengthen freedom of expression.","40 individuals and rights groups sign an open letter to Iceland's interior minister .

"Top Egyptian security officials defended army and police actions in clashes Monday in Cairo that led to the deaths of more than 50 people, saying they were defending the Republican Guard headquarters against attackers. Health Ministry official Khaled al-Khatib said 51 died and 435 others were wounded when Egyptian security forces fought with supporters of deposed President Mohamed Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood outside the headquarters. Witnesses said the military and police fired as protesters took a break from holding a vigil at the Republican Guard headquarters to perform their dawn prayers. Morsy was reportedly detained in the building after his arrest Wednesday. But Interior Ministry spokesman Hani Abdel-Latif and army spokesman Col. Ahmed Mohammed Ali said security forces were under attack. Ali said that around 4 a.m. ""an armed group"" used bombs, rocks and bullets to attack the area and the people safeguarding the headquarters building. Speaking to reporters, the officers said it's the job of the security forces to protect protesters. But, they said, what unfolded was an assault and they had to embark on defending the institution. Ali dismissed claims from the pro-Morsy opposition, such as the killing of children, and warned of ""lying,"" ""rumors,"" and ""psychological warfare."" Video meant to support the security forces' position was shown at the news conference. They seemed to show a few protesters who may have had firearms, but the context of the images is hard to discern. The Freedom and Justice Party's deputy chairman, Esam al Aryan, said on the group's Facebook site that four children were killed. Zakaria: What needs to happen next in Egypt . Speaking about the presence of children before dawn, Ali asked what kind of people would bring their children to that location at such a time. ""The Egyptian armed forces kills only its enemies. It will never kill its own children,"" Ali said. Mirna El Helbawi, a witness who lives on a street near the Republican Guard headquarters, saw violence unfold in the area but stressed no one had been performing prayers at the time. Security forces, she said, arrived at the scene, apparently prompting pro-Morsy people to beat on street lamps and shout, ""They're here. They're here."" Soldiers approaching a nearby mosque tore down stone barricades erected by pro-Morsy groups and fired tear gas. Pro-Morsy protesters, atop the mosque, threw rocks and fired shots. She said she saw one security forces member go down and then be taken away by his comrades. While she heard shotgun bursts, El Helbawi said she is not sure which group initiated the shooting. But she said she is sure both groups were shooting at each other. She also saw fire inside the mosque, a flame that died down and then flared up. She saw an ambulance arrive to get people out of the mosque and about a half dozen bodies were retrieved, she said. Several people were arrested. Amnesty International called Monday for an urgent independent investigation into the 51 deaths. ""There is a crucial need for independent and impartial investigations that can be trusted by all sides. However, Egypt's authorities have a poor track record of delivering truth and justice for human rights violations,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Deputy Director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme, in a news release. Victims treated at a chaotic facility . The Monday morning violence further deepened a crisis in the country -- the Arab world's most populous -- where Morsy supporters have been squaring off daily with security forces after his ouster in a military coup last week. CNN counted at least eight bullet-riddled bodies and up to 40 wounded at the chaotic emergency facility in the Egyptian capital, down the street from the site of the shooting. The upper bodies of the victims appeared to be peppered with shotgun pellets and bullet wounds. Doctors tended to the victims, performing surgeries in many cases before shipping them out to other facilities. Egyptian flags were draped over those who did not survive. CNN shot footage of men bleeding and bandaged on gurneys and blood on the ground. There were not enough ambulances to take all the injured to hospitals, CNN's Karl Penhaul reported on the scene. An Interior Ministry statement earlier said two security force members -- a lieutenant and a recruit -- were shot and killed. It is unclear if the Health Ministry toll includes these personnel. Reacting to the shooting at the Republican Guard headquarters, the Al-Nour party -- which supported Morsy's ouster -- withdrew from all talks about forming an interim government. ""We will not remain silent on the Republican Guard massacre,"" party spokesman Nader Bakkar said. Interim President Adly Mansour ordered the formation of a committee to investigate the incident, according to state-run Nile TV. Later, news outlet Al Jazeera posted a statement online on its English Facebook page speaking out against what it said was the intimidation of its journalists covering the unrest. Dozens of journalists have been rounded up and detained by authorities, the post says. Journalists' offices have been raided, ""threatening leaflets"" have been scattered outside Al Jazeera's offices and ""Al Jazeera Arabic's correspondent"" was ""hounded out of a government press conference by attendees who applauded"" when the event ended, the post says. Meanwhile, the White House appeared to rule out an immediate cut in military aid to Egypt over last week's coup, with spokesman Jay Carney telling reporters Monday, ""It would not be in the best interests of the United States to immediately change our assistance programs"" to Cairo. Asked repeatedly whether the ouster of Egypt's president and nullification of the constitution was a military coup, Carney said the Obama administration would ""take the time necessary"" to assess what he called an ""incredibly complex and difficult situation"" before deciding how to proceed. Under current U.S. law, a coup would stipulate a change in American military aid. Catherine Ashton, European Union foreign affairs chief, and U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki called for restraint and urged reconciliation on Monday. ""Dialogue and inclusiveness are the only way forward in speedily restoring a civilian and democratic framework,"" Ashton said. Psaki said Washington is focused on ""returning stability"" and is hoping that Egyptians will unite ""in a non-violent and inclusive way."" ""We call on the military to use maximum restraint responding to protesters, just as we urge all those demonstrating to do so peacefully,"" she said. Elsewhere, in eastern Cairo, Morsy supporters kidnapped two soldiers, state radio reported. Before the outbreak of violence Monday, more than 30 people had died and 1,400 had suffered injuries since the coup. Egypt's military declared over the weekend it was stepping up security efforts for the demonstrations. ""We also warn against any provocation or clashes with the peaceful demonstrators,"" the statement said. ""Anyone who violates these instructions will be dealt with firmly in accordance with the law."" From hope to despair: Egypt slides into economic uncertainty, again . Top religious figure speaks out . Meanwhile, the grand imam of Egypt's prestigious Al Azhar Mosque called for calm on Monday and urged the release of political prisoners, likely a reference to Muslim Brotherhood members incarcerated in recent days. Sheikh Ahmad Muhammad Al Tayeb, speaking in an audio played on Egyptian state TV on Monday, also called for all parties to refrain from anything that could lead to bloodshed, passed along his condolences to those who died in Monday's violence and urged the state to protect demonstrators. Al Tayeb called for an immediate probe of the killings and an immediate announcement of the results. He urged the formation of a committee to achieve national reconciliation and urged the announcement of a timetable for the political transitional period that won't exceed six months. He said media should work toward such reconciliation and not incite. ""I will from now and on retreat to my house, until national reconciliation is achieved and this bloody atmosphere ends,"" he said. Al Azhar, both the mosque and the university, are influential institutions in the Sunni world. Opinion: Can true democracy exist in military-dominated Egypt? Morsy supporters vow peaceful protests . Morsy has long been affiliated with the Freedom and Justice Party, the Muslim Brotherhood's political movement. The group promised its protests would be peaceful and accused authorities of planning to send fake bearded men into Cairo's Tahrir Square to incite violence. ""This is so they can claim that the supporters of the elected president and the Islamic groups are attacking the peaceful demonstrators. ... We warn those who play with fire that any sectarian incitement at this critical time will not be in the interests of anyone in our beloved Egypt,"" the party said in a statement on Facebook. Team of political scientists saw Egypt's turmoil coming . Tahrir Square will likely attract many people on Wednesday as Ramadan begins in Egypt. Several popular musicians are expected to play, according to state-run EgyNews. Politics in the midst of chaos . The latest violence came only hours after state television reported that Egypt's interim president had nominated Mohamed ElBaradei as vice president and Ziad Bahaa el Din as prime minister. Mansour, the interim president, will need to get political consensus before they are appointed. Presidential spokesman Ahmed Almoslemani stressed on Nile TV there is no specific deadline of when the new government will be announced. Nile TV had previously reported that he said an announcement would be made within 24 hours. Earlier, ElBaradei's name had been floated for the office of prime minister, but a swearing-in announced for Saturday didn't happen. Mahmoud Badr, spokesman for the rebel movement Tamarod, told Egypt's OTV on Sunday that the presidency had tapped ElBaradei to form the new government but then retracted the offer after objections from the conservative al-Nour party. ElBaradei is well-known as the former head of the U.N. atomic watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and a Nobel Peace Prize winner. He was to appear Sunday in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria but canceled it along with all other media interviews, his office said.

"It was a stark and painful reminder. The sound of fireworks echoing through the streets of Surabaya as the clock dragged toward midnight underlining the fact that so many of the victims of QZ8501 were on their way to Singapore to celebrate the new year there. They never made it. And for the past four days, the CNN crew has witnessed the shock, disbelief, frustration, and finally the devastating realization from the families of those missing. Since Sunday evening, we have been staffing our live camera position 24 hours a day just a few paces from the crisis center at Surabaya International Airport. We have spoken to family members and friends, trying to negotiate the fine line between prying and reporting, trying to show the human side of a disaster without gross intrusion into private grief. What has been noticeable has been the stoic dignity of the family members we have met. Bad weather hinders search . Of course there have been scenes of raw emotion. We met Oei Endang Sulsilowati late on Sunday evening, leaning on the arm of her daughter for support. Her brother Oei Jimmy Sentosa Winata, his wife and two children were on 8501. As she told us her story, she repeatedly broke down. Her brother, she said always flew Garuda, the national airline. But this time for some reason he had chosen AirAsia. She paused and broke down again as the awful truth hit home. But she managed to contain her grief and resume her quiet, dignified wait for news. And that was how most family members we saw at the crisis center dealt with their situation. The atmosphere inside the center as they gathered for regular updates was restrained. They were shielded from the media but windows lining the building allowed the media to look inside. Up to 100 family members sat quietly, grim-faced. Some talked but most just stared ahead and waited. Not all though. One image that stuck with me: a man, head bowed and tears streaming down his face, his hand resting on the shoulder of a boy in front, most likely his son. But as the days wore on, more and more began to voice their frustration about the lack of information. Authorities set up video links and Skype calls with search and rescue headquarters in Jakarta, and tried to increase the number of briefings, but there was little concrete news to relate. Until Tuesday afternoon. A press conference from search and rescue in Jakarta broke the news everyone had feared but needed to know. The mystery of  Flight 8501 had been solved. Debris had been found, and authorities were 95% certain it was part of the AirAsia flight. Where does investigation go now? As if the news itself wasn't bad enough, the local broadcaster carrying the press conference live began showing pictures of a body, with few clothes remaining, floating in the water. Our cameraman Paul Devitt was filming and he described the scene as chaos as relatives broke down. Stretchers were brought for at least two people who fainted. One close friend of a passenger described scenes of hysteria, screaming and people collapsing at the news of the debris and compounded by the brutal pictures carried on television. But apart from that one outpouring, the scene at the airport has mostly been one of quiet dignity in the face of unimaginable loss. Many on board were families. In one case seven members of the same family, now thought to have perished. Who was aboard the plane? The waiting goes on as the weather conditions obstruct search operations to locate the main fuselage, thought to contain most of the passengers. The grieving goes on, too, but behind closed doors. And it will continue long after the last of the passengers' remains are finally brought to this city, identified and buried.","CNN crew watches as passengers' families wait for news .

"Outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley took the state's last four inmates off death row Wednesday, commuting their sentences to life in prison without parole in one of his final acts in office. The move comes as the Democrat considers a run for president -- a long-shot bid that many Democrats only expect to gain steam if Hillary Clinton opts not to run. O'Malley's office announced the move in a release Wednesday morning, noting that the state's legislature had abolished the death penalty with a law that took effect in May 2013 and that the state's courts and attorney general have questioned whether the state has legal authority to carry out death sentences that were already imposed. ""In the final analysis, there is one truth that stands between and before all of us,"" O'Malley said in a statement. ""That truth is this -- few of us would ever wish for our children or grandchildren to kill another human being or to take part in the killing of another human being. The legislature has expressed this truth by abolishing the death penalty in Maryland."" The four inmates whose sentences were commuted are Vernon Lee Evans Jr. and Anthony Grandison Sr., who were convicted of the 1983 contract killing of two witnesses scheduled to testify in a federal drug trial; Heath William Burch, convicted of killing an elderly neighbor couple in 1995; and Jody Lee Miles, convicted of robbing and shooting a theater manager in 1997. O'Malley said in the statement that he'd met with the families of the victims of the four convicted killers whose sentences he commuted, and said they would suffer through ""the additional torment of an un-ending legal process."" ""In my judgment, leaving these death sentences in place does not serve the public good of the people of Maryland -- present or future,"" O'Malley said. ""Gubernatorial inaction -- at this point in the legal process -- would, in my judgment, needlessly and callously subject survivors, and the people of Maryland, to the ordeal of an endless appeals process, with unpredictable twists and turns, and without any hope of finality or closure,"" he said.","Maryland Gov.

"She was a contender, at least in hearts and headlines. At 16, Malala Yousafzai would have become the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, if she had been awarded it Friday.  In addition, she would have been the youngest winner ever of a Nobel Prize in any category. Instead, the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded it to the international chemical weapons watchdog that is destroying poison gas stockpiles in Syria -- the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Malala apparently feels like the OPCW deserves it. A message went out on a Twitter account representing her to congratulate the OPCW and thank it for its ""wonderful work for humanity."" The activist from Pakistan, who has stood defiant against the Taliban in the face of death since age 11, has become a global figurehead for a girl's right to an education. A year ago, an Islamist militant shot her in the head.  It looked like she would die.  This week, headlines cheered for her to win the peace prize. She was modest about her own prospects of winning and felt receiving the prize at this point in her life would be premature, she told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview that airs Sunday at 7 p.m. ""I think that it's really an early age,"" Malala said. But there's always later. She wants to do more to earn it first. ""I would feel proud, when I would work for education, when I would have done something, when I would be feeling confident to tell people, 'Yes! I have built that school; I have done that teachers' training, I have sent that (many) children to school,' "" she said. ""Then if I get the Nobel Peace Prize, I will be saying, Yeah, I deserve it, somehow."" The comment drew warm laughter from the audience. Malala for Prime Minister . Despite her diffidence with regards to the peace prize, Malala is very ambitious. ""I want to become a Prime Minister of Pakistan, and I think it's really good.  Because through politics I can serve my whole county.  I can be the doctor of the whole country,"" she said. But greedier politicians be forewarned.  If Malala held the highest office in the land, the money would probably not flow into the pockets of cronies or pork barrel projects.  Her political ambitions seem to stop short of personal gain. ""I can spend much of the money from the budget on education,"" she told Amanpour. It appears that becoming prime minister is a means to the end she has dedicated her life to. Malala has accomplished much for education in her short life, which she has imperiled to do so. The Taliban didn't want girls to go to school.  They banned it in 2009 in her native Swat Valley, which is when Malala's plight and her activism began. Her father, a teacher who ran schools for girls, taught her that she was stronger than what or whom she feared. She kept going to school and speaking out for education, and she wrote an anonymous blog for the BBC about her harrowing experiences. The Taliban came by on house raids, and she had to hide her books. Her country honored her with the National Peace Prize in 2011 for standing up to them. Her defiance enraged the militants. The assassin . A year ago, on October 9, 2012, they sent a gunman after her, while she was riding home from school.  He stopped the improvised school bus and stepped inside. Malala recalled the moment of terror to Amanpour. ""He asked, 'Who is Malala?' He did not give me time to answer his question.""  What happened next may have been a bit blurry for her, but her best friend Moniba later told her. Malala grasped Moniba's hand tightly and pushed hard against it.  She was silent, Moniba told her, as the gunman opened fire at near point-blank range. ""He fired three bullets,"" Malala recalled. ""One bullet hit me in the left side of my forehead, just above here, and it went down through my neck and into my shoulder."" It left behind lasting damage to her ear drum and facial nerve. ""But still if I look at (it), it's a miracle,"" Malala said. She is alive and smiling with no major brain or spinal damage. Emergency surgery in Pakistan saved her life. She was flown to the UK for further treatment. World cause . While she recovered, the world rallied around her and powerful leaders, from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, rallied to her cause. She has already partnered with the United Nations on a program to promote global education with the motto, ""I am Malala."" This week, marking the anniversary of her shooting, she published her memoir under the same title. On Wednesday, the Pakistani Taliban threatened to attack any bookstore that sells it. On Monday, they threatened to kill her again. She may not have won the Nobel Prize on Friday, but the European Parliament awarded her the Andrei Sakharov Prize on Thursday for standing up to an oppressive power. And a Nobel could still be in her future. Committee chairman Thorbjorn Jagland in Oslo told CNN that she could be in the running in years to come. She already knows what she would do with the prize money. ""A Nobel Peace Prize would help me to begin this campaign for girls' education,"" she told Amanpour. In the long run, Malala plans to hold out for an even bigger award. ""But the real call, the most precious call, that I want to get and for which I'm thirsting and for which I want to struggle hard, that is the award to see every child to go to school, that is the award of  peace and education for every child.  And for that, I will struggle and I will work hard.""","Malala Yousafzai would have been the youngest recipient of any Nobel Prize .

"Jeevan Maharjan has a different approach to human waste -- he considers it as wealth. Rather than flush it down the toilet, the 47-year-old Nepalese farmer collects it to spray on his crops. ""It's three times better than chemical fertilizers,"" he said, referring to yield of his fruit and vegetable crops after using human fertilizer compared to more conventional methods. As he walked across his 27,000 square feet of land in Siddhipur Village Development Committee on the outskirts of the capital Kathmandu, Maharjan said his method of fertilizing is nothing new. He described it as an ""age-old tradition,"" passed down from his parents, though he says the approach is now more efficient and clean. Taking a few quick steps towards his ecological sanitation -- or ecosan -- toilet, Maharjan explained how it works. The urine and feces are stored in separate airtight compartments of the toilet, he said, for later use on the land. The urine is kept for about two weeks before it is used, while the feces, which is turned into manure, is used every six months. According to Janardan Khadka, a soil scientist at Nepal's Central Horticulture Center, ""It is important to secure the urine container for two weeks to a month to reduce the risk from bacteria and other germs."" He said that urine can be used safely and the health risk associated with it is generally low. Khadka, however, pointed that users should be careful during source separation at the toilet as fecal cross contamination of urine could increase the health risks. ""It is best to mix urine with compost for best results,"" he added. The World Health Organization's guidelines for safe use of wastewater, excreta and greywater also underscore a mix of multiple health and safety measures. It states: ""Wastewater treatment plus a withholding period to allow pathogen die-off prior to harvest plus good food hygiene plus cooking of food may be sufficient to reduce health risks adequately."" Maharjan, who collects about 100 liters of urine from his family's toilet each month, said for every liter of urine, he mixes three  liters of water and sprays it over his land where he cultivates seasonal vegetables and fruits. Hari Krishna Upreti, senior scientist at the Nepal Agricultural Research Council's (NRC) Botany Division, said urine was surprisingly rich in nutrients. According to Upreti, a liter of urine contains up to 0.9% nitrogen, 0.12% phosphorus and 0.26% potassium  These elements -- collectively known as NPK -- helps regulate the plants' metabolism and contains enough protein for them to grow. ""A person urinates an average of 550 liters per year,"" he said. ""So this produces some four kilograms of nitrogen, which is equivalent to eight kilograms of nitrogen-rich urea."" NARC conducted research between 2004 and 2006 in order to ascertain the risks and benefits associated with using urine as fertilizer. In separate plots of land, they evaluated the effectiveness of chemical fertilizer and urine. While the first year didn't demonstrate a good result, during the second year, the production was equal, Upreti said. But during the third year research, Upreti said they experimented with urine and compost, which according to him is the best nourishment for plants. Maharjan follows the same rule, and the results he said are ""clearly visible."" ""It also enhances the taste and quality of the vegetables,"" he said. ""That's why when I go to the market to sell, people come to me, and they don't mind paying a few rupees extra."" He said at the market his vegetables are considered organic which helps them fetch a higher price. After finding out about the agricultural application of urine in Maharjan's farm, his neighbors followed his lead. Sanjeev Maharjan, who lives a few houses away from Jeevan Maharjan, said he discovered this aspect of urine six years ago and has been using it since. His family has also invested in an ecosan toilet to make the process easier. ""We don't use any chemical fertilizers now,"" said the 24-year-old business student, who also dedicates his time on his family farm. ""The result, as you see, is distinct,"" he said pointing toward the garlic shoots in his garden. In their village of Siddhipur, 100 of the 1,300 households use ecosan toilets, the by-product of which are directly used for agricultural purposes. The Environment and Public Health Organization was one of the first to initiate this project, along with other partners, in 2003, has now expanded to more than 3,000 households across Nepal. Suman Kumar Shakya, executive director of ENPHO, said the growing links between sanitation and agriculture are encouraging. Speaking at a workshop organized to promote ecological sanitation, he said that the steps farmers are taking is ""a [positive] shift toward an organic culture."" Banking on the importance of urine, about 93 miles (150 kilometers) away from Kathmandu, in Chitwan district, users like Shreerendra Pokhrel are taking on the role of promoters. In his village of Darechowk, the school headmaster started the concept from his house in 2006. Soon he was able to convince his neighbors as well as five schools to install ecosan toilets and couple cleanliness with cultivation. ""The children are learning about sanitation and the purpose of urine in farming and their families are implementing it and getting good results,"" he said. For people like Maharjan and Pokhrel, along with other farmers who have traded urine for urea, it has opened up new possibilities -- the production is high and there's no cost associated. ""People have started realizing the value of urine,"" Jeevan said. ""It can do wonders in the farm, and it's absolutely free.""","Growing numbers of farmers in Nepal are using human waste on crops .
It's a free and efficient way to boost production and yield sells for higher price .

"(CNN) -- Erupting Icelandic volcanoes have been known to ground flights, but this time they kept one up in the air as a pilot looped around to give passengers a better view of the spectacle. The extraordinary detour over the smoke and lava-spewing Bardarbunga volcano was captured on camera by one passenger and the image was later posted on Twitter by the airline. ""Our pilot made an extra circle around #Bardarbunga this morning to let passengers check it out,"" it said, thanking Erla Vinsy for the photo. ""Taking a short detour via a circle back around the eruption area, passengers on both sides of the aircraft were treated to an aerial view of the eruption while flying safely over the center of the action,"" Icelandair said in statement released later. It's not often passenger plane pilots turn tour guide, with most sticking to dry commentary about airspeed, altitude and weather and confining off-flightpath maneuvers to holding patterns above busy airports. Volcanic activity around Bardarbunga in August prompted Iceland's Meteorological Office to briefly raise the aviation threat level to red, its highest. There were fears of a repeat of the travel chaos of 2010 when a huge eruption from another Icelandic volcano, Eyjafjallajokull, led to weeks of flight cancellations. The alert related to Bardabunga was lowered to orange just days later and restrictions dropped, but officials said seismic activity was continuing at the volcano. Volcanic ash can be a serious hazard to aircraft, reducing visibility, damaging flight controls and ultimately causing jet engines to fail. From a safe distance though, it's got to be worth a second look.","Icelandair pilot loops back to give passengers a better view of Bardarbunga .

"It was the beginning of the end of World War II: Wave upon wave of allied troops storming the coast of northern France to liberate the country and its people from Nazi occupation, in the largest seaborne invasion in history. Braving everything from heavy seas to machine gun fire and grenades, soldiers clambered ashore at beaches codenamed Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword and began to fight their way inland. Thousands died in the attempt; today their bodies fill military cemeteries along the Normandy coast. Some of their former comrades make the trip back to France every year. ""I don't want them to be forgotten ... it's too early,"" explained retired Staff Sergeant Jacques Jones, laying a wreath at the American cemetery. But with each year that passes, fewer and fewer survive to keep the memory of what happened alive. For Harold Bradley, there is an added reason why landing at Sword Beach is something he could never forget: It was his 21st birthday. ""I landed in Normandy on my 21st,"" he says. ""I remember saying to a friend -- it's my birthday today Rob, and he said: 'It seems a pretty good day to have it.' But of course once you are on those boats you aren't thinking about birthdays."" A gunner with Britain's Royal Artillery, Bradley was there to support troops who had captured the beach three days earlier. ""We were going to join the division that landed on D-Day which required more support from guns, and that was our job. We landed on the 9th, we were there in support of the infantry division; within about an hour of landing we were firing guns."" Bradley lost some of his closest friends in the fighting that followed. Just weeks before the end of the conflict, he was captured by the Germans -- his family were told he was missing in action, and presumed dead -- before being freed by American soldiers. ""I have often wondered since, many times, how my mother must have felt having a telegram from the Foreign Office saying [I was] missing, believed killed, and then a voice comes on the phone and says 'Hello Mum,'"" he says. ""It must have been stunning."" Seventy years on from D-Day, preparations have been in full swing for months: New flags and banners have gone up, the grass at the cemeteries has been neatly trimmed, and everything has been given a spit and polish ahead of the anniversary visit by world leaders including Queen Elizabeth II and U.S. President Barack Obama. Michel Joyeux from Normandy was planning to plant red, white and blue flowers in front of his house when CNN visited -- his flags were already flying proudly. ""With me they are up every year,"" he said. ""It is an honor for me to decorate and commemorate all the soldiers who died."" The cathedral at Bayeux has a new bronze bell to mark the anniversary. Local priest, Father Laurent Berthout, said it celebrated ""peace and reconciliation between the different countries, and between France and Germany, and the friendship between the United States and France and England."" But Berthout said not all of those in Normandy have completely positive memories of the liberation -- some can't forget how destructive it was. Charles Moncouteau, 87, told CNN his village never joins in the commemorations, because it was almost completely destroyed by the fighting. This year, French President Francois Hollande has ordered that attention be focused on the civilian losses as well as the military ones; it is estimated that, during the Normandy campaign alone, 20,000 French civilians lost their lives. Three-quarters of Caen, where Hollande and more than a dozen heads of state and government will gather this week, was destroyed by the fighting when German troops held out there in the months following D-Day, prompting the Allies to lay siege to the city. Scars left by the conflict remain, 70 years later. But many of today's residents of Normandy are simply grateful for the actions of those soldiers -- in some cases, decades before they were even born. ""My gratitude is huge,"" says law student Paul Guillotte. ""I am blessing every day the heroes who came to rescue us."" On June 6, others will say thank you in their own way. American jazz pianist Bill Carrothers will perform alongside more than 100 teenagers from schools across the U.S. and France, offering a musical tribute to those who fought in World War II. ""It's a tiny and fairly insignificant way of giving back to a lot of veterans who went before us and died, fighting for an idea, a very important idea that I think some of the modern wars somewhat lost,"" he explained. ""The landings in Normandy were an important moral event. It wasn't a war for oil, prestige or power. It was for an idea -- maybe the last time in our history that I can think of that it has been the case."" For decades since the war's end, Harold Bradley has declined to take part in events commemorating D-Day. ""It isn't me,"" he explains. ""It's like wearing medals, you know. I don't want to walk up and down with medals on saying: 'look at me.'"" But this year, on the 70th anniversary of the decisive battle, Bradley will be in Normandy to pay tribute to those who fell, alongside other elderly veterans and world leaders. ""I am extremely fortunate to be as fit as well as I am, but obviously it can't last forever -- [I'm] 91 on June 9,"" he says. ""In so much as it could well be the last time, I shall go."" As one of the last remaining soldiers who can recall those bloody days in June 1944, he hopes that such battles remain firmly in the past. ""It would be a dream to say stop wars but at least reduce them, because at the end of a war what have you got? No-one's won anything. Millions dead and you still have the same problem.""

"The UK Independence Party, led by the pub-clubbable Nigel Farage, has won a resounding second successive Parliamentary by-election and sent British politics tumbling into an abyss of the unknown. Mark Reckless, the former Conservative politician who left the party for UKIP in September, won back his seat in Parliament Thursday in the Rochester and Strood by-election that was triggered by his defection. UKIP is now more than just a fringe group thumbing its nose at the big parties: it is a wild card which can threaten all their prospects. Few political experts would claim at this moment to be able to predict the outcome of the next General Election, which will take place on May 7, 2015. And nobody knows how many of the protest votes UKIP has been gathering will stay with them when voters are deciding who will govern the country. But UKIP are still advancing: back in May, they won the European Parliamentary elections with 27 percent of the votes and 24 seats, the first time a party other than Labour or the Conservatives has done so. What seems almost inevitable is that there will be another ""hung"" Parliament after the General Election -- meaning no party will win an outright majority of seats. But this time neither Conservatives nor Labour look like being able to build a coalition government without doing deals with more than one other political grouping. Britain is likely to experience an unstable era of Scandinavian-style politics where the chief preoccupation of the political class is not solving the problems of the nation, but putting together deals to enable any decisions to be taken at all. Reckless was the second former Tory to resign his seat and win his way back to Parliament in the purple colors of UKIP after Douglas Carswell had done the same in Clacton in October. And although his roughly 3,000 vote majority will be less sustainable at a General Election than Carswell's crushing victory, it keeps UKIP on track for its ambition of winning enough seats next May to hold the balance of power. In Rochester, UKIP managed to resist a huge Conservative campaign that included five visits from Prime Minister David Cameron, who was desperate to stave off another UKIP victory that could call his effectiveness as the leader of the Tories into question. UKIP also won over a significant proportion of the former working class Labour vote -- aided by a Labour front-bencher's online posting of a photo of a house in Rochester draped in English flags with a white van in the driveway. Politicians of all stripes were quick to pounce on Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry's ill-judged tweet as snobbish and derogatory, and Thornberry resigned her position before the night was over. UKIP also reduced the Liberal Democrat vote to a derisory figure: some of their former protest votes on the Left are now going to the Green Party. The UKIP bandwagon is still rolling. Reckless was a confused candidate who at one stage was slapped down by Nigel Farage for suggesting that EU immigrants might be sent home, but the party that secured a mere three percent at the last General Election in Britain has become a significant political player. It is now the obvious receptacle for protest votes in the way that the Liberal Democrats used to be. But their participation in a coalition government with the Conservatives has shredded the Lib-Dems' political appeal. UKIP has successfully harnessed to its bandwagon to the common feeling of disillusion with the two major parties and the Westminster ""establishment."" As well as its anti-European stance, it has profited from bringing immigration to the fore as a political issue. This has spooked lawmakers in other parties who have demanded that their own party leaders must also get tougher on immigration -- a policy area on which few deal in facts but on which much emotion is expended. But the more that Labour and the Tories rush out new immigration policies, the more the public say: ""We thought you told us that UKIP were a bunch of fruitcakes, but now you are agreeing they were right all along."" Political strategists used to believe that UKIP were chiefly a threat to the Conservatives, taking the votes of right-wing Euroskeptics away from them. But in the recent Heywood and Middleton by-election in the greater Manchester area UKIP came within a few hundred votes of grabbing a Labour seat too. With the resurgent Scottish National Party threatening to grab 30 of Labour's 40 Scottish seats in the Westminster Parliament, and Labour's leader Ed Miliband proving the lowest-rated occupant of his position in polling history, Labour too are shivering at the UKIP intervention. So where do we go from here? UKIP will revel in its triumph and redouble its efforts to entice more Euroskeptic Conservative MPs to jump ship in order to save their seats at the next election. David Cameron, his authority badly dented after he promised to throw the kitchen sink at saving the Rochester seat, will be under massive pressure from his MPs to turn the political tide now with the major speech he has for some time been promising on immigration (and which he postponed for fear of having the Rochester result taken as a verdict on his efforts). He is handicapped because the Conservatives' pledge to reduce immigration to less than 100,000 a year has failed because of the EU's commitment to the free movement of people within its borders, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel is heading Europe's refusal to reconsider that principle. That again plays into UKIP's hands. Right-wing Euroskeptic Conservative MPs insist that their party and UKIP are part of the same political family, and they will now try to pressure Cameron into some sort of electoral pact -- arguing that otherwise Labour will ""win"" next May's election with less than a third of the votes. Cameron will resist, but the irony for UKIP is that of all the possible election results, the only one that will bring about their chief political aim -- an in/out vote on Britain's membership in the European Union -- is victory for the Conservatives who have promised that referendum.","Conservative Party defector Mark Reckless brings UKIP a second by-election win in two months .

"It's no secret that fertility treatments are behind the increasing numbers of twins, triplets or even quadruplets or quintuplets born in recent years. However, scientists studying the impact of medical intervention on multiple births were in for  a surprise -- in vitro fertilization (IVF), which has anecdotally borne much of the blame for multiple births because more than one embryo is typically implanted, was not the primary cause of multiples. Instead, fertility drugs appear to be the culprit. By 2011, 36% of twin births and 77% of triplets, quads and quintuplets came as a result of fertility treatments including fertility drugs, according to a study published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine. ""We were surprised that non-IVF approaches were more culpable than IVF here,"" said Dr. Eli Adashi, a professor of medical science at the Alpert Medical School of Brown University. He and his colleagues initiated the study because they wanted to find a way to stop the multiples trend. Why? Doctors prefer women give birth to a single baby or a ""singleton"" as they are called in medical lingo.  That's because even with medical advances, multiple births are still considered risky for both mother and babies. Top misconceptions about fertility treatments . ""By and large, human reproduction is designed for singletons, and the optimum outcome we hope for is a singleton birth to term,"" Adashi said. ""When you get into a situation with multiple and higher number births, all kinds of concerns creep in. We wanted to make a deliberate course correction as opposed to flailing indiscriminately at the problem."" While doctors recognized the phenomenon was a public health issue, Adashi said, ""We didn't really have the hard numbers and we certainly did not have the kind of detailed insights into what's driving the increase in the number of multiples."" Researchers arrived at these details by studying the number of times women gave birth to multiples between 1962 and 1966 -- the era before fertility treatments. They contrasted this data with the number of multiple births between 1971 to 2011. All births are tracked by the National Center for Health Statistics. By law, all children born as a result of IVF are also tracked by a national registry. Children born as a result of some other fertility treatment, such as the use of fertility drugs, are not tracked, so researchers estimated that number. What they found, adjusting for maternal age and the national rate of twin births, was that the number of twins increased slightly, by a factor of 1.9 between 1971 to 2009. The number of triplets and higher-order births increased by a much larger number -- they were up by a factor of 6.7 from 1971 to 1998. Thankfully, Adashi said, that number peaked in 1998. That may in large part be due to doctors following guidelines issued that year by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology. Those guidelines encouraged doctors to limit the number of embryos transferred during an IVF procedure. Doctors routinely transfer multiple embryos to increase the likelihood that at least one will result in a pregnancy. Since these guidelines went into effect there has been a 70% reduction in the transfer of three or more embryos during IVF, according to the study. That has in part resulted in a 33% decrease in the proportion of triplet and higher-order births due to IVF. Egg freezing changing fertility treatments . ""Maybe the worst is behind us in this epidemic of multiple births, when it comes to IVF at least,"" Adashi said. However, non-IVF fertility treatments such as fertility drugs still are causing a disproportionate number of multiple births. In such treatments, a woman will take drugs that will encourage her ovaries to release more than one egg a month. The rate of non-IVF twin births has increased slightly, going from 16% in 1998 to 19% in 2011, according to the study. Non-IVF triplet births increased from 36% to 45% in the same time period. ""That's a lot and there is certainly room for improvement there,"" said Dr. Jennifer Kawwass, a fellow at the Emory Reproductive Center. ""Because of limited insurance coverage, we see that patients currently have a financial disincentive to go the IVF route, which means they are leaving this up to chance."" Women struggling with infertility may choose the fertility drug route first because it is cheaper. Often insurance does not cover IVF or caps reimbursement. With this new data, legislators may want to encourage more insurance companies to cover IVF treatments.  Some states do mandate coverage. Teacher who was fired after fertility treatments sues diocese . ""There are clearly ways by which these non-IVF technologies can be modified and there are more prudent approaches that result in less in the way of multiples,"" Adashi said. He believes education is key to help doctors and their patients understand the negative health impacts of giving birth to multiple children. Adashi said he and others plan to continue to watch this multiple birth trend. ""Hopefully by conducting these types of analyses, we should have a good handle on what is happening in this area,"" he said. ""We want to see if we will be gaining in success at limiting the number of multiple births or, God forbid, we are losing the battle.""","36% of twins, 77% of triplets, other multiples came from fertility treatments in 2011 .

"(CNN)One night in early October 2014 I woke up at 2 a.m. and began watching Vital Signs on CNN International. The show was about the future of cancer treatment through immunotherapy -- a topic close to my heart. In 2012, I was diagnosed with stage 3c ovarian cancer, at age 52. As I watched Dr. Sanjay Gupta interview doctors, researchers and two patients at Yale New Haven Medical Center/Smilow Cancer Center, I decided, then and there, that I wanted to be in a research trial. Some days in our lives are memorable.  We all prefer the good days, marriages, births, and graduations.  June 8, 2012 was not one of those days for me. That was the day I was diagnosed.  I went immediately from being a lawyer, mother, and wife -- taking care of everyone -- to being a professional patient. Before diagnosis, I did not know approximately 21,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer annually in the United States, and 14,500 women die from this disease. That's 40 per day and 1200 per month. I am positive for the BRCA genetic mutation, inherited via my father who carried the mutation in his genes. Women like me, with this mutation, have a 50% chance of getting ovarian cancer in their lifetime. While women with breast cancer have a 90% five-year survival rate, women with ovarian cancer have a 45% five-year survival rate.  As there is no test to find it at an early stage when it is most treatable, it's most often found in the late stage (stage 3 or 4) when it is difficult to treat and life expectancy is at its lowest -- 2.5 years on average, But I am now exceeding that average. I had seen my gynecologist eight weeks before diagnosis and had a pap smear (which does not test for ovarian cancer) and a pelvic exam, which were clear. Over the next few weeks I began to experience bloating, decreased appetite, back pain, and frequent urination.   I had all the classic symptoms but was not seeing what they were -- signs of ovarian cancer.  I hadn't paid attention because I was busy running my practice and my home.  Busy with life. Suddenly, June 6, I could not urinate properly.  My GP examined me and scheduled a CT scan the following day. Then on June 8 came the tornado named cancer. Surgery was June 11. After nine days, collapsed veins from IVs, and losing over 20 pounds of ascities -- a fluid produced by the cancer -- I was released from the hospital and allowed a few weeks to heal.  The pathology report showed I had low-grade epithelial cancer which is notoriously difficult to treat. I have a less than 35% chance of living through the next five years. Unfortunately, there has been no breakthrough drug for ovarian cancer treatment in more than 20 years. My treatment began with chemotherapy -- three weeks on, one week off. The drugs Carboplatin and Taxol were infused into my body.  I spent the weeks off trying to clear my ""chemo brain"" and raise my blood levels. I went through six of these cycles spanning July to December 2012.  The treatment appeared to be effective, but by May 2013, I was back on chemo, (this time with Doxil and Avastin). After 16 cycles, in August 2014, this too had stopped working. I was faced with the difficult decision of whether to try treatment that would further deplete me, or enter a clinical trial. I knew I needed a new approach to my treatment and then the night came when I saw the show. The next day I called Yale and learned a new ovarian cancer trial was about to start for which I might be eligible.  They were seeking five patients and my timing appeared to be perfect. Within four weeks I had cleared all the testing and began the trial.  My form of cancer made me eligible as it releases certain proteins which attract the experimental drug, enabling it to attack in a targeted manner.  I describe this as tactical airstrike treatment as opposed to most treatments, which carpet bomb and kill healthy cells in our bodies as well as cancer cells. My treatments are weekly via IV for one hour. Since it is a trial, I also regularly undergo comprehensive diagnostic tests and the chemo nurses check my vital signs to ensure that this drug is helping, rather than harming, me. After six treatments, the cancer is stable and has not grown.  Thus, I am allowed to continue treatment for another six weeks and undergo another evaluation. I know I am one of the fortunate women with a lot of support. My husband has been with me every step, every day, and participates in my care, and the fabulous doctors and nurses have cared for me from the beginning to now. As I say regularly, I am not in the mood to die yet. So, one day at a time I will keep trying until we find something that will work, even temporarily.  Perhaps this trial will keep me alive long enough for science to catch up and help find a cure for this, and other cancers.

"(CNN) -- Toyota has announced drastic production cuts in North America and China due to difficulty in supplying parts following the massive earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Previously, Toyota Motor Engineering and Manufacturing North America, Inc. (TEMA), had said it would suspend production on Mondays and Fridays between April 15 and April 25. That will continue through June 3, the company said in a statement. ""During the same period, production will run at 50% on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday,"" the statement said. In addition, Canadian production will be suspended for the week beginning May 23, and U.S. production for the week starting May 30. No decisions have been made for production after June 3, according to Toyota Motor Corp. ""No layoffs are planned during this period,"" the statement said. ""Team members will utilize nonproduction time for training and plant improvement activities."" ""We are trying to continue production as much as possible and keep our work force intact in order to facilitate a smooth transition back to full production when all parts are available,"" said Steve St. Angelo, executive vice president of TEMA. Last month, Toyota told its U.S. plants to prepare to shut down because of parts supply problems. Toyota employs 25,000 workers in North America. It operates nine plants in the United States in Kentucky, Indiana, Texas, Tennessee, Alabama, West Virginia, California and Mississippi. It also operates three plants in Canada and one in Mexico. In China, the company plans to go to 30% to 50% production from Thursday through June 3 because of difficulties delivering parts. Toyota had already announced that it dropped production in its manufacturing facilities in Japan to 50%. Officials said Tuesday that the drop in production would continue and that Toyota would stop production all together between the dates of April 28 to May 9. The earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck Japan on March 11, leaving thousands dead.","Toyota announces drastic production cuts in North America and China .

"David Cameron has had the narrowest of political escapes. Success for the ""Better Together"" campaign has saved him from catastrophe: he will not, after all, live on in history as the Prime Minister on whose watch the Scottish nation chose to leave the United Kingdom. But serious questions will now be asked in his party and in the country about his future. Cameron will also face an almighty battle in Parliament to deliver the consolation prize of greatly enhanced powers for the Scottish Parliament, the so-called ""Devo Max"" package, which he was forced to concede in the panicky latter stages of the No campaign. On Friday morning, the tired but relieved-looking Premier told reporters at 10 Downing Street that it would have broken his heart to see Scotland leave the UK. ""The people of Scotland have spoken,"" Cameron said. ""They have kept our country of four nations together, and like millions of other people, I am delighted."" Cameron called on the country to move forward with a ""balanced settlement, fair to the people of Scotland -- and importantly, to everyone in England, Wales and Northern Ireland as well."" But although Scottish voters ultimately rejected independence by a margin of 55% to 45%, this story is far from over for Cameron. Did Gordon Brown save it? Cameron and his party were not the only ones to blame for a referendum campaign that so nearly led to the break-up of the United Kingdom. But he is being widely blamed for a variety of tactical and strategic errors. Many members of Parliament (MPs) will say that he and the ""Better Together"" campaign were only rescued by the campaigning fervor and passion of the former Labour Party leader and Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Cameron had sought to detach the questions of Scottish independence and his own future. Warning the Scots that what they were walking into was not a trial separation but a final break, he pleaded with them not to throw away the union in a protest vote just because they disliked him and his party. (Of the 59 Scottish seats in the Westminster Parliament only one is held by a Conservative MP). QUIZ: How Scottish are you? Insisting on the finality of a constitutional divorce was probably his best card. But in emphasizing that the question on the ballot paper was not his future but the future of the union, Cameron was also acknowledging that he is held to blame by many for boosting the nationalist vote. Where Cameron went wrong . He is blamed firstly for the terms he agreed on the staging of the referendum. Critics lambast Cameron now for giving Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond two years to build momentum for his cause, and for opening the vote to 16 year olds. They blame him for agreeing to a ballot paper question which meant that the supporters of independence were the ones campaigning for a ""Yes"" while their opponents were bound to look negative in seeking a ""No."" They blame him for agreeing to let one vote decide the issue: when a Labour government in the 1970s agreed to a referendum on setting up a Scottish Parliament it insisted that 40% of those voting must approve the change. There was a majority for the Parliament but the 40% margin was not achieved and the Scots had to wait another 20 years for their own Parliament. Above all, the critics insist Cameron was wrong to exclude from the ballot paper the compromise option of the so-called ""Devo Max"" — a huge extension in the tax-raising and spending powers of the Scottish Parliament. This devolution of power from London to Edinburgh appealed to many as an achievable compromise which would have taken the steam out of the separatist case. But Cameron overruled such advice, only to find that he and the other Westminster party leaders were forced to concede Devo Max anyway — win or lose the vote — as the campaign threatened to run away from them. Even during the lead-up to the vote, when many Conservative MPs kept quiet for fear of making things worse for the Better Together campaign, some were warning that the concessions on Devo Max wrung from Cameron by Gordon Brown might not be deliverable. What comes next? Conservative MPs are already vociferously demanding that any concessions to the Scottish Parliament must be balanced by greater powers for the English regions -- namely, by reducing the number of Scottish MPs in the Westminster Parliament and by ending the process whereby Scottish MPs at Westminster can vote on English-only matters while English MPs have no say in matters delegated to the Scottish Parliament. As a moderate and pragmatic politician, Cameron has had an uneasy tenure already over a right-leaning party growing ever more Euro-skeptic as it faces the rise of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). The further difficulties he will face in pushing through legislation to honor his commitments to the Scots will do nothing to add to his authority. But Cameron will breathe a sigh of relief at a partial reprieve: had he seen the Scots depart from the UK he might well have faced a rebellion in his party which could have gone as far as the tabling of a vote of no confidence in his leadership -- a process which requires 15% of his MPs (46 of them) to sign up to the proposition. For the moment at least he soldiers on. But there is further trouble looming. Opinion polls indicate that next month his party will lose its first Parliament seat to UKIP in a by-election caused by the defection of former Tory MP Douglas Carswell.","Scotland votes ""no"" in referendum about whether to leave the United Kingdom .

"The investigation into how AirAsia Flight QZ8501 ended up at the bottom of the Java Sea, involves recovering the bodies, accessing the flight data recorders, and meticulously mapping where debris is found to reconstruct its path. An Indonesian search and rescue official told CNN that he thinks material detected by sonar equipment in the water is from AirAsia Flight QZ8501. So what happens next? Priorities . The first priority is to recover the bodies and return them to their loved ones, Indonesian authorities say. Helicopters are lowering divers to bring back bodies and debris from the surface of the water. The bodies give clues about what happened on the flight, based on where they're found and their condition. For example, sea water in their lungs would suggest that the people on board may have been conscious when the plane struck the sea. There is particular attention to the location of the bodies and various debris. David Soucie, a former Federal Aviation Administration safety inspector and analyst for CNN, likens it to ""peeling an onion apart and then putting that onion back together from the inside out."" Investigators map the debris found on the surface of the water. Then they have to look for other pieces in the next level of sea for more clues, he said. ""So you might go down 50 feet or so, to see if there's any floating debris there. And you keep going down and mapping it as it goes. You see how the drift went and how the pieces of the plane moved."" During the investigation of Air France Flight 447, more than 150,000 images of the plane's wreckage site in the Atlantic Ocean were taken. It was important to ""mosaic them together"" to give investigators a comprehensive view of the wreckage site, said David Gallo, who co-led that search after the French jet crashed in 2009. Data recorders . The key to understanding what happened is likely contained in the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, commonly known as black boxes. If they are recovered, Indonesian authorities will designate which agency should open and download the information. The black boxes, which are actually orange, are located in the tail for Airbus 320-200s. The cockpit voice recorder collects audio from the pilots' microphones and various channels. ""It picks up other sounds like clicks, things going wrong, thuds, hail. You can hear that on the windshield,"" said Mary Schiavo, a lawyer and former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Acoustic experts can comb through the audio to try to determine the meaning of every click and sound. The data recorder holds hundreds of pieces of data such as airspeed, altitude, whether the plane's nose was up or down and which direction it was headed. All that data would print out on long sheets, almost like EKGs, that authorities would use to piece together a timeline of the flight. Because the AirAsia plane was only six years old, its data recorder is fairly modern and would contain lots of parameters, Schiavo said. Challenges in the search . Although the plane is in much shallower waters than where Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 is believed to have fallen, search crews face challenges. Nature certainly isn't helping. ""The problem that the search team is now facing is the monsoon season,"" said Eric van Sebille, oceanographer at the University of New South Wales in Australia. ""This plane couldn't have gone down in a worse time of year. There's big winds, choppy waves. These shallow seas are known for complicated waves. It's really difficult to work in."" This could put search and recovery crews at risk and decrease visibility. They're also working under a deadline as the plane's pingers, or underwater locator beacons, only last for about 30 days. Salvage operation . Salvage operations to lift the wreckage are complicated, but the process has been done before in places deeper than the bottom of the Java Sea, which is about 140 feet (43 meters) down. The U.S. Navy salvaged pieces of TWA Flight 800, which crashed off New York in 1996, from depths of 115 to 130 feet. In 1998, Canadian officials lifted pieces of Swiss Air Flight 111 from the depths of 180 feet, off the coast of Nova Scotia. Underwater vehicles, designed for deep water salvage operations, can descend as deep as 20,000 feet. They could retrieve smaller items such as the flight data recorder. Since they can only carry up to 4,000 pounds, larger pieces, such as the fuselage would have to be attached to a cable and pulled to the surface by a crane on a ship. This was done for recovering remnants of the fuselage of Air France Flight 447.","Experts: First priority is to recover bodies and return them to families .
Location of debris and bodies are carefully logged and mapped .
Data recorders are key pieces of evidence .
Salvage operations have been used for plane crashes that were deeper than Java Sea ."
"(CNN) -- Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell apologized Wednesday for leaving out any reference to slavery in his recent proclamation designating April as Confederate History Month, calling it a ""major omission."" ""The failure to include any reference to slavery was a mistake, and for that I apologize to any fellow Virginian who has been offended or disappointed,"" McDonnell said in a written statement. ""The abomination of slavery divided our nation, deprived people of their God-given inalienable rights, and led to the Civil War,"" the statement said. ""Slavery was an evil, vicious and inhumane practice which degraded human beings to property, and it has left a stain on the soul of this state and nation."" McDonnell also announced Wednesday that he would add language about slavery to the proclamation. ""(I)t is important for all Virginians to understand that the institution of slavery led to this (Civil) war and was an evil and inhumane practice that deprived people of their God-given inalienable rights,"" the new language says, ""and all Virginians are thankful for its permanent eradication from our borders."" McDonnell's statement noted that while Virginia was home to the Capital of the Confederacy, it was also the first state to elect an African-American governor, L. Douglas Wilder, who McDonnell called ""my friend."" In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Wilder said that McDonnell's apology and his introduction of additional proclamation language was ""the right thing for him to have done."" ""Most people recognize that slavery was the cause of the (Civil) war,"" Wilder said, noting that McDonnell had called him Wednesday. ""The war was not a glorious thing in our past. It was something that we were able to withstand in terms of tearing the country apart. ... Thank God that war ended with the Confederacy losing."" Not all Democrats were willing to forgive McDonnell on Wednesday. ""He has a right to apologize,"" Virginia State Sen. Henry Marsh III, a black Democrat, told CNN. ""But I don't accept that as a good answer because this is a pattern of this governor."" ""He says the wrong thing, he sends a signal to his base and then he makes an apology,"" Marsh said, ""It's a question of whether or not he's sincere or not."" Other Democrats accepted McDonnell's apology. ""My great, great grandparents, their offspring and others were split up in the Commonwealth of Virginia & sold into slavery,"" Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor Donna Brazile said on Twitter. ""Apology accepted . McDonnell is the first Virginia governor in eight years to issue a proclamation declaring April as Confederate History Month in the state, a move that drew criticism from Democrats and a civil rights group. Former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, now Democratic National Committee chairman, issued a statement Wednesday blasting McDonnell's exclusion of slavery from the original proclamation. ""Governor McDonnell's decision to designate April as Confederate History Month without condemning, or even acknowledging, the pernicious stain of slavery or its role in the war disregards history, is insensitive to the extraordinary efforts of Americans to eliminate slavery and bind the nation's wounds, and offends millions of Americans of all races and in all parts of our nation,"" Kaine wrote. ""A failure to acknowledge the central role of slavery in the Confederacy and deeming insignificant the reprehensible tran         sgression of moral standards of liberty and equality that slavery represented is simply not acceptable in the America of the 21st century,"" he continued. iReporter: McDonnell's ""step in the right direction"" McDonnell quietly declared April Confederate History Month after two previous Democratic administrations refused to do so. ""It is important for all Virginians to reflect upon our Commonwealth's shared history, to understand the sacrifices of the Confederate leaders, soldiers and citizens during the period                                       of the Civil War, and to recognize how our history has led to our present,"" the proclamation reads in part. Virginia Delegate Kenneth Alexander, chairman of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, said the governor's proclamation was offensive. It ""offered a disturbing revision of the Civil War and the brutal era that followed,"" Alexander, a Democrat, said in a written statement. ""Virginia has worked hard to move beyond the very things for which Gov. McDonnell seems nostalgic."" The Virginia chapter of the NAACP also condemned the proclamation, The Washington Post reported. The group did not immediately return phone calls to CNN. The Sons of Confederate Veterans asked the governor to declare April Confederate History Month in Virginia, which had seceded from the Union on April 17, 1861. Brandon Dorsey, a spokesman for the group, told CNN Radio that Confederate History Month isn't about slavery or race, but about studying the four-year history of the Confederacy. He said it will also help draw visitors to the many Civil War battle sites in Virginia, helping to boost tourism. ""The proclamation's main goal is to call attention to the fact that there is Confederate history in the state of Virginia, of course, across the South,"" Dorsey said. ""It's simply a tool to expose individuals to that history. ... It's not meant to discriminate against anybody."" Other Southern states have issued similar proclamations for April. In Alabama, Republican Gov. Bob Riley declared April, the month the Civil War began, as Confederate History and Heritage Month. His statement condemned slavery. CNN Radio's Shelby Lin Erdman contributed to this report.","NEW: Nation's first African-American governor says apology was the right thing to do .

"""Women are Japan's most underutilized resource."" So said Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in April as he outlined a raft of measures aimed at closing the gender gap in the Japanese workforce. As a Western journalist new to Japan, it is a shock that it takes an economic argument to move the government to act toward more female participation in the workforce. But it's not just a foreign perspective. The noted economist Noriko Hama writes in the Japan Times this week, ""You secure better working conditions for women because they have a rightful claim to such treatment. No other reasoning or justification is necessary to do something that is decent and just."" Nevertheless, if you are a prime minister in urgent search of growth, the numbers behind so-called ""womenomics"" in Japan are compelling. 'If you were to close the employment gap between Japanese men, which is 80%, one of the highest in the OECD, with Japanese women -- which is still around 60% -- we estimate that you'd add about 8.2 million workers into the Japanese workforce,"" says Kathy Matsui of Goldman Sachs, who has long championed the cause. That influx of female workers ""could lift the asset level of Japanese GDP by as much as 14%,"" she adds. Now Prime Minister Abe is trying to force corporations to act. He has set targets of at least one female executive per company and offered tax incentives to companies that encourage mothers to return to work. Despite equal employment opportunities enshrined into law in 1986, real equality within most domestic Japanese companies remains within the realm of fantasy-land. Naoko Toyoda had worked for 10 years with an IT company but was demoted to a starting position when she came back after the birth of her first child. ""Women who choose not to have a child would continue up the corporate ladder while those who did would be forced into semi-retirement,"" she says. She didn't expect flexibility from the company's side though. ""Once one exception is allowed, other mothers would complain they weren't treated in the same way,"" she says. So she quit. According to Goldman Sachs, some 70% of Japanese women choose to leave the workforce after they've had children. That's more than twice the number in the U.S. or Germany. But unlike the U.S. and Germany -- where childcare is cited as the major factor for why women leave work -- in Japan, uncompromising work environments, which demand face-time and offer little career mobility for women, persuade most mothers to give up corporate life. A 2011 study by the Center for Work-Life Policy called ""Off-Ramps and On-Ramps Japan: Keeping Talented Women on the Road to Success"" found that three quarters of Japanese women want to rejoin the workforce after they've had children, but only 43% manage to get their careers back on track. Those who do return to work tend to take salary cuts and often find themselves, like Toyoda, marginalized within the company. Cosmetics giant Shiseido does better than most. Since 1990 its childcare support program has been in continual evolution, providing employees with extensive leaves of parental absence, shorter working hours, childcare subsidies and on-site nursery facilities. It is also working on a gender equality action plan to boost its ratio of female leaders though it admits it will miss its slated target of 30% by end 2013. Shigeto Ohtsuki, executive director of human resources at Shiseido, describes the management style in the past as ""very slow moving.""  Even though Shiseido is an example of corporate best practice in Japan, Ohtsuki admits there is still some way to go along the road towards true daibashitii, the Japanese word for diversity. ""The female leader ratio in Japan Shiseido Group, representing 25,000 employees is still 25.6% whereas female leader ratio overseas where we have 20,000 employees is almost 60%,"" Ohtsuki says. Yuki Honda joined Shiseido in 1989. She met her husband there and they have two children. She feels grateful to the company for continuing to support and promote her throughout. ""I think I was fortunate with this company because they did not assume we women would quit after childbirth and they educated us so we'd continue to work,"" she says. Japan's bleak demographic outlook is well known. The birth-rate is shrinking, the population is getting older and there are fewer workers' to pay for the nation's pensioners. The IMF forecasts Japan's population will shrink by around 30% by 2055. Abe's push to make the workplace a more hospitable place for women -- quite apart from the argument that it's just more fair -- is also a matter of economic survival. Whether Japan's male corporate bosses are listening remains to be seen.","Japan is pushing measures to close the gender gap in the nation's workforce .

"(CNN) -- Two days before his official trip to Afghanistan, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, a ""big lie"" intended to pave the way for the invasion of a war-torn nation, according to Iranian state media. Ahmadinejad, known for his harsh rhetoric toward the West and Israel, said the attack on U.S. soil was a ""scenario and a sophisticated intelligence measure,"" Iran's state-run Press TV reported Saturday. The assault was a ""big lie intended to serve as a pretext for fighting terrorism and setting the grounds for sending troops to Afghanistan,"" Press TV reported Ahmadinejad as saying. It's not the first time Ahmadinejad has denied a historical tragedy. In the past, he has denied the existence of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of some 6 million Jews during World War II, and suggested Israel should be ""wiped off the map."" ""Today,"" he said Saturday, ""with blessings from the Almighty, the capitalist system, founded by the Zionists, has also reached an end,"" Press TV quoted Ahmadinejad. Ahmadinejad's comments Saturday came just two days before his visit to Afghanistan to meet with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, according to the semi-official Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA). Ahmadinejad has blamed the ""problems in its eastern neighbor"" on foreign troops there, ILNA reported Sunday. The one-day trip is the first for both leaders since their re-election, ILNA reported.

"Some may call it serendipity, others divine intervention. Either way, circumstances prevented two families from boarding doomed AirAsia Flight QZ8501. In one case, it was missed emails. In another, an illness in the family. As a result, 15 people -- seven of them children -- are alive and well. 'Truly a miracle' It was no stroke of luck but an act of God that her father caught hepatitis, said Inge Goreti Ferdiningsih, because it made her family cancel their tickets on the AirAsia flight a day before it took off. ""We are extremely grateful, and God is really great,"" she said. ""I believe that God is saving and protecting us, and this is truly a miracle."" Inge Goreti booked the family vacation nine months earlier. Her father wasn't booked on the trip, and her younger sister was staying by his side. So, Inge Goreti could still have gone, with her husband and three children. 'Feeling in my heart' The bags stood packed and ready, and the family was full of anticipation for the Singapore vacation. Christopher 10, Nadine, 7, and Felix, 5, were psyched about taking a local ship cruise, splashing at a water park and watching animals perform at Sea World. But then Inge Goreti's sister called from a hospital, where she had taken their father after he complained of stomach pains. The diagnosis: hepatitis. The news tugged at her. ""I had this feeling in my heart that I wanted to be with my dad,"" Inge Goreti said. So, she called off the trip Saturday, a day before the flight. Christopher had a hard time accepting it. He was so looking forward to the trip and became very upset, she said. 'We were late' An aversion to phone messages may have spared another family. Christianawati was going to ring in the New Year in Singapore with her family and her brother's family, she told a French news agency. Ten were traveling in all. But her brother forgot to check messages from AirAsia telling them that the flight was leaving two hours before the original departure time. ""They emailed and called us on December 15 and 16 to inform us, but we missed those calls,"" Christianawati, who goes by one name, told Agence France-Presse. ""So we arrived at the airport to check in for the 7:30 a.m. flight but were told our flights had been rescheduled to 5:30 a.m., and we were late. Of course we were angry,"" she said. Some family members pulled up in their car just in time to see the last passengers whisk past them into the boarding lounge, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. But Christianawati's family was traveling in two cars, and one was lagging behind. They just missed the flight. Then they heard the news. ""Maybe it is all God's plan that my family and I were not on the flight,"" Christianawati said. ""It was a blessing in disguise."" 'Broke down and cried' Early Sunday, at Inge Goreti's home, the phone rang -- a few times. ""We received calls from relatives regarding the plane that lost contact,"" Inge Goreti said. ""We all broke down and cried."" Sunday evening, the family went to church to give thanks. But mixed with Inge Goreti's tears of relief have been tears of sadness. She recognized names on Flight QZ8501's passenger manifest, she said. Friends and colleagues were on board.","It's an act of God that her father got hepatitis, says woman who canceled her family's flight .

""Everybody that met her, knew her, loved her,"" Terry Rutledge said about Veronica Rutledge, 29. She died Tuesday after her young son shot her accidentally while they were out shopping with other family members, authorities said. Rutledge -- who put herself through school and was a chemical engineer -- ""was a fun-loving, outgoing, outdoorsy person,"" said Terry Rutledge. ""Her family liked to camp, hike, do outdoorsy things. They loved being together,"" he said. He said that Veronica Rutledge had carried a gun for years and had extensive training.

According to Wolfinger, the toddler removed the 9mm Smith & Wesson semi-automatic handgun from his mother's new handbag, one that was ""specifically designed for concealed carry of a firearm,"" he said. ""The 2-year old removed the firearm from the purse and fired one bullet from the pistol. The bullet struck Mrs. Rutledge in the head, killing her instantly.""

"An overnight storm delivered surprise snowfall and windy chaos to Southern California, stranding more than 100 motorists in the mountains, ripping boats from moorings and apparently killing a coastal island harbor patrolman. In all, at least two people in California were killed in storm-related incidents since Tuesday, authorities said Wednesday. In the Northern California city of Redding, a woman was killed in her sleep at 2:15 a.m. Wednesday when a tree fell on a corner of the house where she, her husband and 3-year-old daughter were in the same bed, authorities said. The woman's death was attributed to the windy weather, and the husband and toddler were also pinned under the fallen gray pine but were later freed with minor injuries, said Deputy Fire Chief Gerry Gray in Redding. The strength of the Californian winds was captured Wednesday on a YouTube video as the gust blasted through the Rose Bowl grounds, a day before the college playoff game between No. 2 Florida State and No. 3 Oregon. The video shows a twisting wind uprooting tents, poles and tarps, sending them skyward in a swirl. People scattered in an area dedicated to football fans. One person was whipped to the ground as the individual tried to grab control of a flying pole. The airborne tents and debris raked parked vehicles. Four people sustained minor injuries, said spokeswoman Lisa Derderian of the Pasadena Fire Department. Deaths in harbor . Elsewhere in Southern California, a harbor officer was killed in the waters of Catalina Island, and the death appears to be weather-related, Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said Wednesday. The body of a second person, a man in his 50s, was also found in the water of Avalon Harbor, but authorities couldn't immediately attribute that death to the weather, Winter said. Winter told CNN affiliate KTLA that the Avalon Harbor Department officer was trying to secure boats when he fell into the water Tuesday. ""There were boats that had broken loose from their moorings. He evidently got swept overboard and was pinned between the boat and rocks,"" Winter said. Catalina Island resident Tom Quinn was sitting in one of the bars along the harbor when the storm unfolded rapidly, he told the affiliate. Avalon is a popular Catalina Island tourist destination about 25 miles across the water from Los Angeles' southernmost San Pedro neighborhood. The patrolman was trying to save a vessel, and the other deceased victim was also an experienced sailor, Quinn told KTLA. The Harbor Patrol, whose staff includes a harbor master and 11 patrol officers, assign moorings and provide security and enforcement of state and local laws, the city of Avalon says on its website. The patrol officer was trying to save the King Neptune vessel when the officer was swept off the boat, according to John Etheridge, a Fountain Valley resident who owns property on the island. He told CNN affiliate KABC he witnessed the incident. ""When (the boat) hit the beach, it hit with a great deal of force and hit a couple of times and he was just thrown overboard,"" Etheridge told the affiliate. ""It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen."" A crowd of 30 to 40 people saw the incident from shore and frantically tried to save the man, but they were unable to, according to Etheridge. It was the worst storm he has seen on the island. ""There was no space in between the swells. It was just tearing boats off their mooring,"" Etheridge told the station. Video footage showed that at least three boats were beached near the harbor seawall Wednesday. From the sea to the mountains . The wicked winter storm stranded motorists on a pass in the San Bernardino Mountains near Crestline, California, authorities said. Crews began using snowcats late Tuesday and rescued 136 trapped motorists on Highway 138 at Old Mill Road by 3 a.m. Wednesday, authorities told CNN affiliate KABC. The all-weather, all-terrain snowcats, which have tank treads, trudged up the highway, the fire department said on its Twitter account. Then they took the motorists down to a local church. The motorists became tuck near the town of Crestline, when a wreck blocked the road, and snow piled in on top of them, San Bernardino County Fire Chief Mark Hartwig said. Some of them pulled out their phones and called for help. Cell phone pictures posted to Twitter showed vehicles that had slid off the road. Elsewhere in the San Bernardino Mountains, overnight snowfall trapped at least additional 25 motorists in their vehicles. They were also being rescued and taken to a shelter, fire officials said. ""I tried to come around the corner ... I didn't have the chains, so I hit the brakes and I went and veered off toward the other side,"" Paul Lewis of Hemet told KABC of being stuck on State Route 330. Rare snow in Southern California . The snowfall was an extraordinary sight in palm tree-laden Southern California, and one resident in Murietta got out of bed to take video and a selfie of the rare snowflakes in the semi-arid area. ""It's been snowing all night. I couldn't believe my eyes. It never snowed here,"" said 26-year-old Mohamed Attia, who posted a video and a photograph on his CNN iReport page. In Orange County, Michael Edman woke up to a couple of inches of snow in Rancho Santa Margarita. ""This the lowest, most snow I've seen"" in the foothills, said Edman, an electrician for the Irvine school district who has lived in Orange County all his life, including the past 12 years in Rancho Santa Margarita. He posted a photograph of the snow-laced hills on his CNN iReport page.","""It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen,"" witness says of officer's death on boat .

"To many Westerners, Manga is synonymous with fantasy -- its glossy lines, popping color palettes and fanciful scenarios are an escapist's delight. But one of the most celebrated makers of the wildly popular Japanese graphic novels says he draws on reality as much as possible. Takehiko Inoue was just 23 when his second Manga propelled him to fame in Japan. ""Slam Dunk,"" published in 31 volumes of magazine ""Weekly Shonen Jump"" in the early 1990s, followed the fortunes of a loveless delinquent who joins a basketball team to impress a girl, and then discovers a natural ability for the game. Inoue's interest in Manga was piqued when, at nine years old, he read a popular baseball Manga called ""Dokaben."" It had ""attractive characters,"" he recalls, ""and how they play baseball and how their bodies were drawn -- all these things looked so cool."" A keen basketball player at high school, Inoue says drawing a basketball Manga was a natural way for him to combine his two loves, and he believes ""Slam Dunk"" readers could see the obvious enjoyment he took from drawing basketball. ""I really drew it in the way I liked, did whatever I wanted,"" he says. ""Slam Dunk"" has now sold almost 120 million copies, been licensed in 17 countries, and adapted into an anime TV series.  An English version was released in North America in 2002. Its popularity endures: According to a 2012 survey by research group goo, it is still the second most popular Japanese Manga, and is responsible for the single most memorable piece of dialogue -- when a coach says, ""If you give up, the game is already over!"" Its legacy has also continued well beyond the page. Inoue is credited by some with having popularized basketball amongst a whole generation of high school students. In 2007, his publisher inaugurated a scholarship that sends high school basketball players to study in America, and in 2010, Inoue received a commendation from the Japanese Basketball Association, for his services to the sport. More from Human to Hero: America's black cowboys fight for their place in history . Inoue says he likes to photograph scenery -- flowers, trees, cats, the sky -- to deepen his appreciation of the natural world. He also draws on first-hand observation: While working on ""Real,"" an award-winning wheelchair basketball Manga begun in 2001, Inoue attended a Paralympic game to study the players' musculature and posture. ""After I saw it closely, I was able to draw with more reality,"" he says. When he is ready to start a new work, Inoue first discusses possible storylines with an editor. Next, he installs himself in a cafe -- where he can't be distracted by DVDs or the internet -- and begins drafting the story in small sections, hand-drawing with pencil on paper. He conceives in terms of double-page spreads -- ""I think about what the readers would see first when they open the next page: What would jump into his or her eyes first?"" -- and says, ideally, characters generate their own narrative. ""If you can have vivid characters, they will make the story themselves. By putting them in certain situations or having one meet another, they naturally make stories by reacting to each other."" (""It sounds like a very easy thing,"" he adds. ""I wish it was."") Inoue finds the next stage, drawing with pen or brush, more enjoyable. With pen, he says, ""I get into a very subtle, delicate world of work;"" with brush drawing, ""it gives me more freedom ... the brush goes to some uncontrollable place."" More from Human to Hero: Chinese sculptor Xiang Jing's painful search for truth . In particular, Inoue says he pours himself into the task of capturing facial expressions. ""I try to express what kind of feelings the characters are having, and how strong those feelings are, as if they are actually coming out of my body. ""It is like I become one with the character,"" he says. ""I think it is similar to acting."" ""When I am drawing the face expression of the character, I have the same expression on my face. I never realized myself, but people have told me so."" Tradition dictates that he take special care over face shapes and eyes, but he says drawing hair is fun. ""There is no set way of drawing (hair) so I can draw pretty much as I like ... You don't have to think about anything when you draw hair."" Inoue also strives for realism in behavior and dialogue, and says the most important thing is to create and populate a world readers can believe in.

"(CNN)Editor's note: Mike Rowe's essay about the deadly arrests of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York has struck a chord. It touches on the topics of police behavior and resisting arrest. The essay was first posted as a response to a fan's question on Rowe's Facebook page: . ""Hello Mr. Mike Rowe. I'm a big fan and also happen to work in the lower Haight as well as live in Alameda. I have to ask, with everything that is going on in Ferguson, how do you feel about the protests in San Francisco as well as the looting/rioting in downtown Oakland? Hi Meghan, . Last week, those very protests blocked off one of the major arteries, and as a result, I was 90 minutes late to a holiday dinner in Alameda. I apologized for my tardiness, and was told by my hostess not to give it a second thought. 'It's a small price to pay,' she said, 'given all that's at stake.' Another guest, already well into the eggnog, wondered aloud if a heart attack victim waiting for an ambulance stuck in traffic might hold a different view? Within moments, everyone was talking about Garner and Brown, and the conversation got very political very quickly. A liberal guest said, 'Look, I wasn't there, but it seems pretty clear that both men would still be alive had they been white.' A conservative guest replied, 'I wasn't there either, but it seems pretty clear that both men would still be alive if they hadn't resisted arrest.' This annoyed the liberal, who asked the conservative why Republicans wanted a 'police state.' This annoyed the conservative, who asked the liberal why Democrats wanted 'total anarchy.' Things continued to escalate, and within moments, fingers were pointing, veins were bulging, and logical fallacies were filling the air. Ho! ho! ho! For once, I kept my mouth shut and listened as a roomful of decent people tore each others throats out. It was remarkable, because no one disagreed on the big points. No one disagreed that black lives mattered just as much as white lives. No one disputed that racial bias in law enforcement should be exposed and eliminated. In fact, no one disagreed about the basic facts surrounding each case. The breakdown happened over relevance and context. My conservative friends were focused on the fact that both men died while resisting arrest, and were therefore responsible for their own demise. They wanted to discuss the killings in light of the incredible risk that all police officers agree to assume. My liberal friends were focused on the fact that both men were unarmed, and were therefore victims of excessive force. They wanted to discuss the killings in the context of historical trends that suggest bias plays a recurring role in the way cops treat minorities. By dessert, it was clear that both sides wanted law and order. But the conservatives were convinced that order is only possible when citizens treat cops with respect. Liberals, on the other hand, were arguing that order can only occur when cops treat everyone the same. And round and round we went. The chicken and the egg. Later, on the drive home, I called a friend of mine back in Baltimore. He's black, successful, and hard-working. He also resents the way he's gotten swept into the zeitgeist of Ferguson. In his words, 'I'm a pawn in someone else's agenda, and I'm sick of it. I know what bias looks like in my life. I'm tired of being represented by two petty criminals who died resisting arrest.' I hadn't thought about it like that, but he's got a point. The vast majority of black Americans have never broken the law. And yet, millions of lives are now entwined with the death of Brown and Garner. That's not fair, but it's hardly breaking news. Minorities are constantly stereotyped and the impression lingers. Looters and arsonists run amok, and Black America suffers the association. Now I'm trying to get my head around the fact that two cops are dead in Brooklyn, assassinated by a lunatic in 'retaliation' for Ferguson and Staten Island. Unbelievable. How much worse can it get for the millions of law-abiding minorities, struggling to be seen as individuals? How much worse can it get for the thousands of honest cops, trying to protect a citizenry that doesn't seem to appreciate their daily sacrifice? A few days ago, people were marching in the streets, literally calling for the execution of police. ('What do we want? Dead Cops!') Others are standing by today, waiting to lionize the assassins who answer the call. These are not the champions of justice; these are the enemies of civilization, and it's up to sensible people on both sides of the aisle to close ranks and shout them down. If we want to live in a nation of laws, we need to support the humans sworn to uphold them. They're a lot of really great cops out there who have promised to do that very thing, including the one in my family. We'd be screwed without them. To answer your question Meghan, I support peaceful protests, and I'm all for rooting out bad cops. But let's not stop there. If we're serious about saving lives, and eliminating the confrontations that lead to the demise of Garner and Brown, let's also condemn the stupidity that leads so many Americans to resist arrest. I don't care if you're white, black, red, periwinkle, burnt umber, or chartreuse -- resisting arrest is not a right, it's a crime. And it's never a good idea.

"Scotland will remain part of the United Kingdom -- along with England, Wales and Northern Ireland -- following a historic referendum vote. By 55% to 45%, a majority of voters rejected the possibility of Scotland breaking away and becoming an independent nation. Shortly afterward, Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister and leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, announced his resignation from both posts, effective in November. Salmond said he was proud of the campaign for independence, and that now was the time to hold the UK leadership to its promises of shifting more autonomy to Scotland. ""We now have the opportunity to hold Westminster's feet to the fire on the 'vow' that they have made to devolve further meaningful power to Scotland,"" he said in a statement. ""This places Scotland in a very strong position."" UK Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed Scotland's decision in a televised statement outside 10 Downing Street, saying it was a clear result. ""Like millions of other people, I am delighted,"" he said. Cameron said he would have been heartbroken to see the United Kingdom broken up -- but paid tribute to the efforts of both sides in the campaign. ""We hear you,"" he said to those who voted for independence, adding this was an opportunity to change the way people in the United Kingdom are governed, and ""change it for the better."" His government has delivered on devolution in the past and will deliver on it again, Cameron said. A ""new and fair settlement"" will be created for Scotland and for the other countries of the United Kingdom, he said. Salmond accepted defeat in an earlier televised statement  -- and urged the rest of the pro-independence camp to do the same. He thanked Scotland ""for 1.6 million votes for Scottish independence"" and said the turnout -- which electoral officials said was 84.6% from an electorate of more than 4.2 million -- was one of the highest in the democratic world for any such vote. Queen Elizabeth II said the outcome of the vote will be met with a range of emotions, but was hopeful ""that these emotions will be tempered by an understanding of the feelings of others."" ""Now, as we move forward, we should remember that despite the range of views that have been expressed, we have in common an enduring love of Scotland, which is one of the things that helps to unite us all,"" the Queen said in a statement. Sigh of relief . The final result in the referendum was 1,617,989 votes in favor of independence from the United Kingdom to 2,001,926 against. This means the pro-union camp won by a margin of 55.25% of the vote to 44.65% -- a much wider gap than opinion polls in the final days leading up to the vote had suggested. The result means the main political parties in Westminster -- and many people across the United Kingdom and Scotland -- can breathe a collective sigh of relief that the threat of a breakup of a centuries-old union is over. However, many on the ""Yes"" side will be bitterly disappointed. The referendum was closely watched around the world, particularly in nations like Spain, whose Catalonia province is home to a vocal independence movement. U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed the result and praised the Scots ""for their full and energetic exercise of democracy."" ""Through debate, discussion, and passionate yet peaceful deliberations, they reminded the world of Scotland's enormous contributions to the UK and the world,"" Obama said in a statement Friday morning. ""We have no closer ally than the United Kingdom, and we look forward to continuing our strong and special relationship with all the people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as we address the challenges facing the world today."" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen also welcomed the news that the United Kingdom, a key member of the defense bloc, would remain united. Investors liked what they saw. The pound was firm against the U.S. dollar and the euro, after recovering much of the ground lost earlier this month when surveys suggested Scotland was on the brink of abandoning the union. Stock markets also rose, with shares in Scottish companies doing particularly well. Darling: 'Unity over division' Salmond, who heads the governing Scottish National Party, hailed the political engagement seen in Scotland during the campaign and appealed for unity going forward. ""Today of all days, as we bring Scotland together, let us not dwell on the distance we have fallen short. Let us dwell on the distance we have traveled and have confidence that a movement is abroad in Scotland that will take this nation forward, and we shall go forward as one nation,"" he said. Salmond has previously said that if the ""Yes"" campaign lost the referendum there would not be another vote on independence in a generation. Labour lawmaker Alistair Darling, who led the pro-union campaign in the Scottish referendum, hailed the result Friday but said that the message that the people of Scotland want change must be heard. ""The people of Scotland have spoken,"" he said.""We have chosen unity over division and positive change rather than needless separation. ""Today is a momentous result for Scotland and also for the United Kingdom as a whole -- by confirming our place within the union we reaffirm all that we have in common and the bonds that tie us together. Let them never be broken."" He gave a commitment that the political changes promised by the Westminster parties -- involving the devolution of more powers to Scotland -- would be kept. Darling also called for the country to unify after debate that ""has created some fairly deep divisions in our country,"" and a campaign ""that has both energized but at times divided"" the Scottish people. ""Those divisions now need to be addressed and that requires leadership,"" he said, promising to play his part. Scottish teens face historic vote . Clegg: Radical package of powers . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, whose Liberal Democrats are in a coalition government with Cameron's Conservatives, said he was ""absolutely delighted"" by the result. ""But a vote against independence was clearly not a vote against change and we must now deliver on time and in full the radical package of newly devolved powers to Scotland,"" he said. ""At the same time, this referendum north of the border has led to demand for constitutional reform across the United Kingdom as people south of the border also want more control and freedom in their own hands rather than power being hoarded in Westminster."" Labour Party leader Ed Miliband also hailed a ""historic achievement"" in keeping the union together. He promised change across the United Kingdom in a speech to supporters in which he looked forward to the general election battle due next May. The first of the 32 councils to declare all went to the ""No"" campaign, as did the capital, Edinburgh, which voted overwhelmingly to stay in the union. Fife and Aberdeenshire also voted ""No."" Glasgow delivered a solid win for the independence camp but the lead was not big enough to overturn the ""No"" camp's overall majority. Dundee, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire were the only other councils to vote ""Yes."" Political fallout . Scotland has had a devolved government since 1999, meaning many, but not all, decisions are made at the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh. As opinion polls showed the lead held by the ""no"" vote shrinking fast in the days leading up to the referendum, the leaders of all three main parties in Westminster responded with the promise to give major new powers over tax, spending and social welfare to Scotland if it stuck with the United Kingdom. Now the party leaders face the challenge of pushing those changes through a possibly rebellious Parliament on a tight timetable. The process of handing over those new powers will start from Friday, Cameron said in a speech in Aberdeen earlier this week, with draft legislation expected as soon as January. ""This is a timetable that is now agreed by all the main political parties and set in stone and I am prepared to work with all the main parties to deliver this during 2015,"" he said. Although Scotland has chosen to stick with the union -- staving off potential calls for his resignation -- Cameron will still face political fallout over the vote. Critics have accused him of complacency during the long months of campaigning when Salmond's ""Yes Scotland"" campaign was laying the groundwork for its late surge. Cameron's longtime Labour rival, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, is credited by many with bringing the vital energy that eventually carried a lackluster ""No"" campaign to victory. Critics have also accused Cameron and the other main party leaders of giving away too much in a last-ditch effort to keep Scottish voters on board. It remains to be seen how the promise to give greater powers also to England, Wales and Northern Ireland will be borne out. Cameron will also likely face difficult questions over his own leadership in the run-up to a general election due to take place next May.","Queen says she hopes ""emotions will be tempered"" by understanding .

"At approximately 3,350 meters, it's Europe's highest and most active volcano. Living up to its volatile reputation, Mount Etna blew its top again over the weekend. Etna eruptions are relatively frequent -- the past 12 months have seen a string of powerful lava fountains, flows and ash emissions. The result: a landscape that constantly changes as lava hardens, craters collapse and, in some cases, are created. A trip to the top section of Etna is a bizarre experience -- from near the stunning peak it's easy to understand why the volcano is one of Sicily's most popular tourist destinations. More: 10 things to know before visiting Sicily . It's tricky to line up a visit when the volcano is spewing fury like an angry goddess (Aitna, or Aetna, was the Greek goddess of the volcano), so most Etna tourists end up with the saner, sober version. The images in the gallery above are from one such lava-less visit. Yet even on calm days, the Etna landscape is otherworldly -- it only takes a bit of imagination to picture James Tiberius Kirk stumbling about with his tricorder looking for life. Bleak yet stunning . With black lava sand, volcanic gravel and rocks that crunch underfoot, the volcano is a world apart from the classic beaches and hilltop Baroque towns that dot Sicily. For hikers who start from the amenity-packed base at 1,800 meters, the scenery varies little. The walk up can be monotonous. Another way up is via a cable car from the base that connects with a 4x4 bus to take visitors to the 2,800-meter mark. A guide meets each vehicle and leads a walk around the area -- this is a good way to see some of Etna's numerous craters. Total trip time: up and down in two hours, including lots of photo opportunities. For most visitors, it's the easier, more efficient way to see the volcano. You can get closer to other parts of the volcano by signing on with one of many authorized Etna expedition tour outfits. Cable car, 4x4 and compulsory guide fees cost about €57.50 ($80) per adult. Cable car only is €27.50. At almost three kilometers above sea level it isn't always exactly gelato weather on the mountain. Layered clothing is a smart idea. The volcano turns into a no-frills ski resort that operates December to February, depending on snowfall. Getting to Etna . In peak summer months, Etna traffic gets busy. The easiest way to get the mountain is via public bus from Nicolosi or other nearby towns. In less hectic periods, driving is ideal. The windy road on the south part of the peak that crisscrosses old lava flows is a nice teaser for the scenery to come. Comprehensive driving directions can be found on the Etna administrative headquarters website. Maps, expedition operators and more details can also be found at the Etna administrative headquarters. Mount Etna is open daily, all year (when not erupting in a life-threatening way), 9 a.m.-5:30 p.m. (last cable car); in winter to 3:30 p.m.","Mount Etna is open to tourists every day of the year unless authorities deem it too dangerous .
An ascent that includes a cable car, 4x4 bus and guided walk is the easiest way to explore the volcano .
The volcano's peak is actually a series of craters, some more active than others ."
"It began with secret texts to untraceable phones. Meetings took place in seedy bars, dark alleys, gas stations. Actual documents came in packages without notes, without return addresses. You would think the secrets being passed dealt with national security, organized crime or the corruption of high public officials. Nope. The secrets these whistleblowers began telling CNN last summer dealt with the deplorable treatment, or lack of treatment, of American veterans. But why all that secrecy? Employees of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, from all across the country, told us people who speak out face retaliation that could end their careers and permanently harm their family's finances and futures. Today, the Office of Special Counsel announced details from VA whistleblower cases illustrating just how true that fear at the VA has become. The OSC announced it is now looking into allegations of reprisals against 37 employees from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The OSC said it has received the complaints from employees at VA facilities in 19 states. And the complaints run the gamut -- from allegations of retaliation for disclosing improper scheduling practices to retaliation for exposing other threats to patient care. ""Receiving candid information about harmful practices from employees will be critical to the VA's efforts to identify problems and find solutions,"" said Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner. ""However, employees will not come forward if they fear retaliation."" Lerner's staff recently blocked disciplinary actions against three VA employees after they ""disclosed wrongdoing."" Lerner's staff says the VA agreed to hold off on the proposed discipline. This will allow the OSC to further investigate the reprisal claims, they said. In the just the past fiscal year, the Office of Special Counsel has fought the punishment of 14 VA employees who had been retaliated against for being critical of the agency. VA doctors scared to talk . Last fall, six doctors in Columbia, South Carolina and Augusta, Georgia, came forward to describe to CNN how delayed colonoscopies and endoscopies had led to the death of as many as 20 veterans. None would appear on camera. None would even allow us to quote them. But they begged CNN to tell the story. One doctor would meet only privately in an unpopular, seedy restaurant where he felt certain no one would recognize him. Another doctor only met with us and spoke in a dark, outside location where no one could see him. Another doctor asked us to only speak through a third-person intermediary, providing documents that could not be traced but that could be authenticated to provide us reliable sourcing. Code word: 'Tender Vittles' On background, CNN began conversing with one of the doctors who was so frightened of retaliation that he asked that we text him on a private, untraceable cell phone using coded language. And he asked that any phone calls or e-mails had to start with the words ""Tender Vittles,"" as a way to identify it was ""safe"" to move ahead with him. Several of the doctors, we were told, had tried to tell administrators of their concerns that patients were being harmed by delays and that some had died or suffered serious injuries. But we were told those doctors were treated harshly by administrators who did not want to hear of the complaints. All the doctors confirmed to us that VA officials had posted warnings in the hospital's halls and elevators that no VA employees could speak with the media or divulge details of what went on inside the hospital. The warnings, the doctors said, included details about laws that could be violated and penalties that employees could face, including financial reparations and even jail time, if they were to speak out publicly, and if the hospital suffered financial losses as a result. In Arizona, more fear and dread . Just like the fear in Columbia and Augusta, the source in Phoenix was scared to trust us. We were told to meet at a bar in a strip mall 20 miles outside of downtown. No cameras, no notes and the pounding rock music was so loud, it is doubtful even a hidden microphone would have worked. But it was here we heard the entire story of the secret list in Phoenix. The employee would not allow us to use a name, a position, even a length of service. And we are deliberately leaving out his/her gender. The VA employee remains scared to this day, but everything said inside the seedy bar has proved to be true. A fatal wait: Read the original Phoenix story that started it all . The secret list, the destruction and the cover-up through intimidation had been in place for more than a year. It wasn't secret to anyone inside the Phoenix VA. But what this employee was telling us was the other ""not-so secret"" secret -- about what happened to anyone who spoke against the administration. Sharon Helman, the now ex-director of the Phoenix VA, had a common retort to any naysayer who complained, we were told: . ""If you don't like it here, let me buy you a Seventh Street bus pass."" The bus stop was right under the sixth-floor window of Helman's office. Germaine Claro, a whistleblower who worked under Helman at the Edward Hines Jr. VAMC outside of Chicago, says, ""There's a lot of fear, employees are scared to step up when they see things that are negligent ..."" Claro says when the news broke in Arizona surrounding secret lists and Helman, no one was surprised. ""It's something that is regular business, nobody is shocked that it's in the news, in fact people are relieved that finally people, employees are being heard, that this is a huge problem."" We heard the same thing from other whistleblowers as they came forward in Texas and Colorado. Brave doctor goes on the record . Most of the credit goes to a whistleblower who wasn't afraid to speak -- and speak forcibly. Dr. Sam Foote admitted to us back in April, in his first on-camera interview, that the only reason he was coming forward so publicly was because he had finally retired, lined up all his government retirement benefits and felt the VA could not retaliate at that stage. He had blown the whistle on the secret list months before, but no one on the inside reacted. A token investigation in December by the Office of the Inspector General did not end the practice of hiding veterans waiting for care. Foote had been labeled a troublemaker by the Phoenix VAMC administrators. And even in the middle of his very public interviews on CNN, a whisper campaign tried to discredit his facts and his honor. Suddenly we were getting calls from inside CNN, from fellow reporters, editors and even anchors who had been contacted telling them our reporting was wrong, the numbers were off, Foote was a troublemaker and not to be trusted. It was always the same: anonymous sources who were trying to discredit Foote and discredit CNN's reporting. Now a report has made it official: The Office of Special Counsel is investigating the great lengths allegedly taken to silence those who would expose a scandal this Department of Veterans Affairs had been successfully hiding for years.

"Japan isn't a country to which you just show up and wing it. For foreigners, the language barrier can be intense, the technology overwhelming and the prices terrifying for just about everything other than instant ramen. The key is preparation. We've taken care a lot of that for you with the tips below, leaving you to puzzle out the fun stuff, like getting out of a karaoke bar with your dignity intact and figuring out how to ask them to hold the katsuobushi at breakfast. 1. Rent a wireless router . Getting a prepaid SIM card with local calling service is difficult in Japan. It's better to rent a handy little wireless router, known as ""pocket Wi-Fi"" in Asia. This will allow multiple gadgets -- smartphone, laptop, tablet, Kindle -- to connect at once with un-throttled, unlimited data. Local calls are then possible via cheap Internet phone services like Skype. You can rent and return one of these devices easily at the telecom company counters at most airports. Booking online before the trip brings the price down even lower. Global Advanced Communications, for example, offers a deal of ¥5,550 ($53) for a seven-day rental plan if you book before the trip. They deliver the device to the airport/hotel/office for free the day before your arrival, and include a prepaid envelope for returns. 2. Book a Japan Rail Pass before arrival . Booking the flat-rate foreigner-only Japan Rail Pass, which can be used throughout the extensive JR train network on all four main islands, can save a lot of money for travel by train. There are two types of Japan Rail Pass. The Green Pass (¥38,880 or $374 for a seven-day pass) is for ""superior class"" green cars on trains. The Ordinary Pass (¥29,110 or $280 for a seven-day pass) applies to economy class cars only. As green cars are less likely to be full, the Green Pass makes it easier for couples or groups to sit together (or sit at all). Important: the pass must be booked outside of Japan before the trip. To procure one, visitors must do the following: . • Buy an exchange order from JR sales offices and agents in a foreign country (see the list here).• Make sure their passport is stamped with ""Temporary Visitor"" when they enter Japan.• Bring exchange order and stamped passport to a JR Station with a Japan Rail Pass exchange office (list of stations here). 3. Buy a Pasmo card or a Suica card . For multiple trips on short-distance trains (including the subway and metro area JR trains), get a Pasmo card or a Suica card that can be charged in bulk. These transportation cards save time otherwise spent buying individual tickets for each journey (it can be difficult to figure out how to select your destination on ticket machines). They're especially handy when transferring trains, and are available for purchase at ticket vending machines in train stations, bus stations and subway stations. Preloaded options range from ¥1,000 to ¥10,000, with a deposit of ¥500 included in the price. While some trains don't accept Pasmo and some won't accept Suica, most will accept both and the two are pretty much interchangeable. They can also be used to make purchases at stores and vending machines. 4. Download the Hyperdia app . Cabs are extremely expensive in Japan -- the price is hiked up even higher at night from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. -- so it's good to have a firm handle on the public transport system. This easy-to-use Japan train app is a godsend to foreign travelers and is free for the first 30 days. Upon entering train departure and arrival stations, the app displays (in English) the exact journey time, distance, fare and transfer stations, as well as which track your train is departing from. This includes long-distance shinkansen as well as subway trains. Woe to those who are late by even a minute -- the schedule is incredibly accurate. 5. Take advantage of discount rates on domestic flights . Thanks to a fierce price war for domestic flights, Japan's major carriers offer discounts for foreign travelers for any air travel within Japan. ANA's Star Alliance Japan Airpass allows international visitors to take up to five domestic flights for just ¥10,000 ($96) each. Japan Airlines offers a Oneworld Yokoso/Visit Japan fare starting at ¥10,800 ($103). Tickets must be booked outside of Japan on the airlines' global websites. 6. If there's a choice, fly into Haneda, not Narita . Haneda Airport is a lot more convenient for most travelers to fly into than Narita International Airport owing to the distance from Tokyo for both. It is not always an option. Delta for example only flies in and out of Narita while Cathay Pacific serves both airports. A train ride from Haneda to Tokyo Station takes approximately 28 minutes and costs around ¥580 ($6), while the train ride from Narita to Tokyo Station takes approximately 58 minutes and usually costs at least ¥2,600 ($25). If you need to, there are easy train connections between the two airports, just factor in around an hour of travel time to be safe (see the route map here). 7. Book N'EX or Keisei from Narita . If you're flying into Narita, the N'EX (Narita Express) and Keisei Skyliner are competing services, both with their advantages. While ticket prices are usually higher than ordinary trains, N'EX is currently running a deal on one-way trips from Narita into the city for ¥1,500 ($14), half the usual price. The deal is for trips to Omiya station only, not Tokyo Station which is where N'EX terminates and starts from (Tokyo Station to Narita is ¥3,020). The Keisei Skyliner connects Narita with the Ueno and Nippori stations -- depending on your final destination, this can be a better and more timely connection that Tokyo Station. Tickets are ¥2,470 ($24) while there is a special e-ticket discount (¥2,200) for foreign visitors, full details are here including the available trains for discount. 8. Download Google Translate app . The extent of the language barrier may come as a surprise to first-timers to Japan. We asked translators and a publisher of English study materials in Japan, and they agree that the Google Translate app is one of the handiest ways for translating what you want to say on the spot. It has a camera input option and is available offline for Android 2.3 and above, and is free to download. Many of the translations are hardly perfect, but your hosts and others you meet will at least get the gist of what you're trying to say. 9. Print out your hotel address in Japanese . This goes for travel to most foreign countries as well, but it's a particularly useful tip in Japan. Just in case your phone battery runs out and you can't look up the address in a taxi, have a print-out to show the driver. 10. Know where to get cash . It can be surprisingly difficult to find an ATM that accepts foreign cards, even in Tokyo. The ATMs that do can be found in 7-Elevens, post offices and Citibank ATMs. Again, this sounds obvious, but you can save a lot of frustration by double checking before you arrive that your card is activated for withdrawals in a foreign country. 11. Know where to find refuge . When in doubt, head to a konbini -- a Japanese convenience store, including 7-Elevens. They sell everything from phone chargers to underwear to concert tickets. The hot food selection is also extensive -- varying from fried chicken to udon to yakisoba sandwiches.","Practical tips include pre-booking a wireless router and a JR Rail Pass .

"A Ukrainian cargo plane crashed shortly after takeoff in mountainous southeastern Algeria on Saturday morning, killing seven people who were aboard, Algerian state-run news agency Algerie Presse Service reported. The Ukraine Air Alliance plane crashed about three minutes after it took off from Algeria's Tamanrasset airport, APS reported. Rescuers reached the crash site about 15 kilometers south of the airport but found no survivors, the news service reported, citing the country's transportation ministry. The Tamanrasset prosecutor visited the scene of the crash and has ordered police to conduct an investigation, according to APS. The Russian-built Antonov An-12 plane was carrying oil equipment, headed from Glasgow, Scotland, to Equatorial Guinea; Tamanrasset was one of its stopovers, APS reported. No cause of the crash has been announced.","Plane crashed three minutes after takeoff, state-run Algerie Presse Service reports .

"The hunt to become the home of Barack Obama's lasting White House legacy has become a game of presidential library survivor.  For now, the President's native Hawaii can only hope, to borrow a phrase, that it is not voted off the island. ""I would just note that the President chooses to spend his winters in Honolulu, not Chicago,"" said Hawaii's recently elected Gov. David Ige, who touted the islands' appeal as the First Family's annual refuge during the holiday season. Still, Ige acknowledged his state is an underdog in its competition with the three other remaining proposed bids to win the multimillion dollar project: two in Chicago and one in New York. ""Hawaii has been the underdog before. We trust the President and the foundation will make the best decision,"" Ige added during an interview at his office in the state capitol. In between rounds of golf, the president conceivably has had time to decide where to place his library. But White House officials declined to comment on whether any meetings on the topic have occurred over his winter vacation in Hawaii. In many respects, Hawaii's proposed Honolulu site is a strong contender.  The eight-acre parcel of land is on the city's spectacular waterfront, looking out on Waikiki Beach and Oahu's iconic Diamond Head peak.  Another perk, Ige noted, is that this slice of paradise is already owned by the state. There are, however, some potential drawbacks to Honolulu.  Set apart from the U.S. mainland, Hawaii is hardly a convenient place to preserve presidential documents. Presidential libraries are intended for researchers and historians, not foreign tourists and families on vacation, a source close to Hawaii's bid conceded. Another potential obstacle is that a sizable portion of the site has been transformed into a tent village by dozens of Honolulu's homeless, including women and children who would be forced to move to another part of the city. A homeless woman who called herself ""Bernie"" said the tent village is buzzing with rumors the city will push out the area's inhabitants to make way for development. ""Now we know why we got to leave. I have no problem that they want to make a library. But where is the rest of everyone going?"" she asked. Bernie suggested Obama pay the area a visit. ""He should come back and take a look. It's like they're trying to hide us back here, trying to shove us back here,"" she added. There is a sense of resignation in the tent village that the waterfront area may well be selected as the home of the Barack Obama Presidential Library. ""I guess he can do whatever he wants to do. He's the President. I better keep quiet. I might offend people,"" said another woman, who asked to be identified only as Grace, as she served hot meals to homeless people out of the back of her car. Honolulu city officials explain the homeless tent village on the city's proposed library site will have to be moved either way, as developers have plans for new construction, with or without a presidential museum. Despite those issues, Honolulu's prospects did receive a possible boost this week from the city once considered the front-runner to host the presidential library, Obama's adopted hometown of Chicago. The Obama Foundation, which has been tasked to lead the library search, has raised ""major"" concerns about the two proposals coming from Chicago, according to sources familiar with the selection process. Foundation officials are alarmed that the sites included in a pitch from the University of Chicago are controlled by city Park District officials. The foundation would rather have the university in charge of the land in order to ease construction. Concerns with a separate proposal from the University of Illinois-Chicago stem from upcoming leadership changes there. The city of Chicago is urgently working to remedy the problems with the University of Chicago proposal by clarifying how the land can be used, said an aide to Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former White House chief of staff. But city officials concede there is little they can do about the University of Illinois' issues. In an indication of how fierce the library competition has become, Hawaii's governor grinned upon hearing about Chicago's problems, describing them as ""terrific"" for his own state's prospects. The other remaining contender for the library, Columbia University in New York, may be benefiting from the issues plaguing the Honolulu and Chicago bids.  One sticking point in selecting Columbia's upper-Manhattan neighborhood: It already boasts one ex-president, Bill Clinton, who keeps an office there. For now, the Obama Foundation is taking a restrained approach in commenting on the looming decision that the President and first lady are expected to make in early 2015. ""The foundation is evaluating all four respondents across a variety of criteria. Each institution is unique and has different strengths and weaknesses relative to the others,"" the foundation said. With the President and first family still in Oahu, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell is hoping to give the Obamas his best pitch before they return to Washington. He plans to see the Obamas off on the tarmac at Hickam Field when they fly out this weekend, though will only raise the library if the feeling is right. ""Any time I get with the President, I will try my best to make a plug for our site,"" he said. ""But I want to send him off with aloha."" Acknowledging Hawaii's long odds to win the selection process, Ige and Caldwell are both suggesting an alternative proposal of splitting Obama's post-presidential home, with the official library in either Chicago or New York and a separate presidential center in Honolulu. Caldwell said he has joked with Emanuel, Chicago's outspoken mayor, about the library competition. ""I've joked around a little bit with Rahm Emanuel, and there's a chance we share parts of it,"" Caldwell said.  ""But I do believe for people to truly understand the President they have to understand this place,"" he added. While Hawaii is certainly remote, Ige noted the islands already act as a cultural bridge between the United States and Asia. Add to that the state's large Asian-American population, and a Hawaii presidential library would neatly reflect Obama's goal of pivoting U.S. foreign policy to Asia, Ige argued. ""We believe the presidential center would allow the President to really showcase what he believes as we move forward,"" Ige said. ""The multicultural fabric of Hawaii is such a profound statement of his desires,"" he added.​ .","Hawaii is one of four finalists in a bid for Obama's presidential library .

"Rome (CNN)It could have been, in the words of the Italian coast guard, a disaster. But thanks to authorities, a ship on course to crash against the rocky Italian coast was stopped in time, saving passengers and averting a possible environmental catastrophe. Italian coast guard commander Filippo Marini said the vessel was cruising on autopilot toward the coast at 6 nautical miles per hour. When it entered Italian search and rescue waters, the coast guard sent helicopters with six men, who boarded the ship and took control. The course of the vessel was reversed to avoid a collision with the rocks, and it was piloted instead to Gallipoli, in Italy's southern Puglia region. It docked safely there Wednesday. The freighter carried 796 migrants, the coast guard said Thursday, most believed to be from war-torn Syria. Authorities on Wednesday put the number of migrants on board at 768. The crew of the Blue Sky M apparently jumped ship. The coast guard said a collision would not only have led to the deaths of passengers, but would also have created an environmental disaster. It said a ""real disaster"" was avoided. The freighter sent a distress signal near the Greek island of Corfu on Tuesday, alerting Italian and Greek authorities to the situation on board. The Greek Merchant Marine Ministry and the Greek Navy have said the pilot of a Greek helicopter that flew over the cargo ship spoke with the captain, who said the ship was not in distress and did not need assistance. Floriana Segreto, a spokeswoman for the Italian coast guard in Rome, said there were no deaths related to the Blue Sky M incident. She added that about 100 people have been hospitalized, mainly because of the cold and exhaustion. It was not immediately clear where the migrants will go. The authorities will investigate what happened to the crew and how the freighter reached Italy's waters.","Italy's coast guard says there were 796 migrants aboard the ship .

"The 2-year-old who gained attention after an online video of him swearing went viral will remain with his teenage mother, a judge ruled Monday. An Omaha juvenile court judge ruled Monday that the toddler and his mother would be placed with the same foster family. In the video, the diapered boy is taunted and cursed at by adults, who coax him into using crude words. The toddler knocks down a chair and responds to some of the comments with a middle-finger salute. The 17-year-old mother and her son had been removed from their home and placed in protective custody after the video surfaced last week, but officials said their removal had little to do with the video, CNN affiliate KETV in Omaha reported. Last week, the mother defended her son in an interview with KETV. CNN is not identifying the mother or her son because they are juveniles. ""He's a smart little boy. All that cussing that he did, he doesn't do that,"" the mother said. ""Somebody told him to do that. My son doesn't do that. I don't allow it."" She said a friend of her brother filmed the video while she was in another room. ""He was wrong for doing that ... posting the video up and getting us into this situation,"" she said. ""Everybody that thinks I'm a bad mother, I'm not. I'm a good mother to my son. I teach him a lot. He's very smart."" The police union in Omaha posted the clip on its website to highlight what it called the ""cycle of violence and thuggery"" the community faces. Afterward, the Omaha Police Officers Association came under fire from the city's police chief, the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska and at least one community leader. They say posting the video needlessly antagonized minority communities, which make up about a quarter of Omaha's 409,000 residents. The ACLU said the union's use of ""racially charged language"" was ""very disconcerting."" Sgt. John Wells, the union's president, said the video was ""disturbing"" and ""offensive."" ""The focus here isn't on any particular ethnic group. The focus here is on the troubling behavior toward this child,"" Wells said. ""This behavior is going to potentially lead this child down a path that is completely unhealthy."" Members of the police union turned the video over to the department's child victim unit, Wells said.","A judge rules the toddler and his mother should live with the same foster family .

"When a famous musician dies that loss is usually felt more widely than most.  In my case though, the death of one particular musician this year was a moment of keen significance, because I literally owe my life to Phil Everly, and his older brother Don. My parents were born into the austerity of south-east England, as London and its surrounding areas recovered from World War II.  Not long after my mother had started school, my grandparents decided to leave the difficulties of post-war London behind them and move out to the Essex countryside bordering the city to its east. My father's family, also Londoners, had made the move some years earlier.  My grandfather, who served in the Royal Engineers in Europe and North Africa during the war, returned to work in one of the many oil refineries dotted along the Thames estuary. My mother was 14 when she met my then 16-year-old father.  The early '60s may have been swinging in central London, but the decade's influence was less obvious in the suburbs.  My parents' first encounter, in 1962, was a model of chaste restraint, at a village dance where boys and girls were kept under the careful watch of adults (especially during any slow dancing.)  My dad walked my mum home, and assures me that nothing untoward took place. By this time the Everly Brothers' powers had already peaked, but their influence on my father was still growing.  His first encounter with their silken harmonies actually came in 1958, huddled under blankets at his aunt's draughty house.  There he would listen to the sounds of one of rock 'n roll's pioneering platforms, Radio Luxembourg.  ""All I Have To Do Is Dream"" played through the speakers of the wireless, as radios were always called back then, and he was hooked. My mum and dad dated happily for a couple of years, but in 1964 they hit a blip.  On a chilly night, the couple were walking back from a dance at their local college hall.  Peter Knight and the Nightriders had been playing.  At the bus stop, my mum told my dad that she no longer wanted to be his girlfriend.  Powerless to change her mind, he waved her goodbye for what might have been the last time.  Like Marty McFly in Back to the Future, my life was fading from the picture. The Everly Brothers, too, were on the wane.  But their sound was underpinning many of the tracks that were now piloting bands to superstardom.  Rock 'n roll may have been a new sound, but it owed a heavy debt to its forebears.  Listen to ""Please Please Me"" by the Beatles, and compare it to ""Cathy's Clown"" by the Everlys (the first record to top both the UK and U.S. charts at the same time,) and it is hard not to notice the similarities. In a bid to win back my mother's affections, my dad hit upon an idea.  He headed to his local record store and bought a copy of ""So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad).""  He passed it to my mum's brother, with whom he was good friends.  It was a classic inside job: The man who is now my uncle passed it to the woman who would become my mum; she played it on the family's gramophone, and -- in the words of Ella Fitzgerald -- the spell was cast.  My parents met again, and were reconciled.  They didn't know it at the time, but I too was saved. My dad's affection for the Everly Brothers never faded.  He kept pace with disco, listened to the new romantics of the '80s, had a brush with reggae, and even dabbled in house music.  But all of these would be punctuated by the Brothers' gentle voices. The Everlys split acrimoniously in 1973, with Phil famously smashing his guitar and storming off stage.  But they reformed for a special Reunion Concert at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1983.  Inevitably, my dad was there -- with my mum by his side. Two years later, he insisted on taking me and my sister, aged 12 and 10, to London's Hammersmith Odeon to see the Everlys for ourselves.  We were sat near the front, and the aging but still potent duo won me and my equally cynical sister over completely.  At the end of the concert my dad lifted my sister onto his shoulders and Don shook her hand. My dad actually had a couple of encounters with Phil Everly years later, while working in California.  He was shopping at Vons in Burbank when he saw Phil and his then girlfriend Patti buying groceries.  Star-struck and too polite to approach them, he didn't take his chance to say hello.  However, not long after, he found himself dining in a Los Angeles restaurant on the next table to the couple.  This time he made his move, and was able to finally meet his idol -- who was impeccably warm and polite.  Sadly, in his excitement, my dad forgot to tell him about the record. In January this year, as news broke that pulmonary disease had claimed Phil's life, my brother-in-law called my parents' house to check if they had heard.  My mum broke the news to my dad, who sat down and cried inconsolably. Throughout the week he received calls from friends and family, all checking to see how he'd reacted to the news.  It was as if a family member had died, and in a way -- for my dad at least -- that was what Phil and Don Everly were and are. For my own part, the news was a reminder of the comforting soundtrack of my youngest years; of car journeys to the coast, lazy Sunday mornings, family gatherings and parties.  Above all though, it was a reminder of the story of my parents' near break up, their reconciliation, and the debt I owe Phil and his brother. So thank you, Phil Everly, and may you rest in peace.

"They know Russian tanks would make short work of their ramshackle defenses and shallow trenches. But with U.S. and Europe shrinking from the fight, this rag-tag band of civilian volunteers know they could be the first, last and only line of defense if Moscow rolls into this corner of northeast Ukraine. ""We can't expect help from anybody else. Our own government is too passive. But hopefully we can rely on support from ordinary Ukrainians,"" Vladimir Fedorok told CNN on a blustery morning close to the Ukrainian border village of Senkivka. In more peaceful times, Fedorok runs a farm supplies company. Now, with Russia estimated to be massing up to 88,000 troops just across the border from Ukraine's eastern frontier, he finds himself marshaling a newly formed self-defense committee. They're setting up an outpost along the highway that cuts from the Ukrainian-Russian border to the Ukraine's interior. Klitschko pulls out of presidential race . He and his closest aides, Younis and Olec, are clad in British Army-issue uniforms from the Iraq ""Desert Storm"" campaign. They still bear the Union Jack insignia on the left sleeve. ""We picked them up at the bazaar. I've no idea how they got there. Including my boots, I paid around 100 euros,"" Fedorok said. Other members of his self-defense unit are sporting surplus combat jackets and pants from other European militaries. All of the volunteers say they have some army training from time spent doing military service. Fedorok said they've also been getting refresher courses from friendly Ukrainian army officers in recent days. Two members of the group claim -- like an unspecified number of other Ukrainian nationalists -- to have fought alongside Muslim insurgents against the Russians in Chechnya. Best hope is to slow any advance . But if the Russians roll into eastern Ukraine, it will be very different from the house-to-house urban combat that has previously taken place in the Chechen capital of Grozny. This region is home to sweeping expanses of farmland and scattered forests, classic terrain for a tank war -- the kind of scenario both Soviet and NATO forces drilled for during the Cold War years. Fedorok and his patriots have encircled their dilapidated outpost with piles of old car tires. The plan: If the Russians stream down the highway en route to the district capital Chernigov, they'll burn rubber and set up a smokescreen. They say they have no real weapons, but this band of brothers has made up a stash of Molotov cocktails, with rags stuffed into old vodka bottles. The few yards of trenches that stretch into a nearby tree line are only a fallback position, and hardly constitute a sturdy defensive line. ""As much as anything else, we're put here making a political point. We know this outpost is only an effort to slow down the Russians,"" Fedorok said matter-of-factly. ""I shouldn't be telling you this but our plan is to break down into five-man units and we will launch a guerrilla-style partisan war against the Russians,"" he added, declining to specify how many volunteers he has under his command. But these paramilitary militias may not be entirely alone. Fedorok drives a few kilometers up the highway closer to the border to introduce us to a detachment of Ukrainian soldiers. For now, they're coordinating operations. A fresh-faced army major with a Russian-made AK-74S assault rifle slung over his shoulder told us his men are on high alert. ""These are military times,"" he said as he showed us a little of his hardware: three armored personnel carriers mounted with heavy-machine guns, dug into the earth and camouflaged with branches from birch trees. A few yards away stood a Russian-made T-80 tank. The major said there were more tanks half buried behind berms in the forest. 'Looking toward our brothers' All the vehicles are pointing toward a bridge. The major, who declined to give his name, said the order was to defend the bridge or blow it up if the Russians advanced across the border. But unlike the civilian self-defense militias, these soldiers seem a little unsure when I asked whether they would really stand and battle the Russians. In Ukraine's Crimea region, the Ukrainian army confined itself to barracks or surrendered. Earlier this week, the Defense Ministry in Kiev said a full 75 percent of its force in Crimea either defected or simply went AWOL when the Russians moved in. Here at the eastern border, the major in charge of this armored detachment shook his head slowly. ""I prefer to say that we are not pointing our tanks at the Russians but merely looking toward our brothers in case they advance in friendship,"" he said. The major said he could scarcely believe he was on high alert to battle troops from Moscow. ""We trained in the same military academies during Soviet times and after that. We see them as our brothers,"" he said. The Pentagon's latest figures put the number of Russian troops massing just over the border at about 40,000. The Ukrainian government's National Defense and Security Council estimates the figure at 88,000, but that estimate may include units a little farther from the border region that could be deployed as a second wave in the event of an invasion. Moscow has insisted it is only carrying out drills. And in televised comments Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov insisted his forces had no intention of crossing into Ukraine. However, in a telephone conversation with President Barack Obama Friday night, Russian President Vladimir Putin once again reportedly raised concerns about ethnic Russians living in eastern Ukraine. He suggested Ukrainian ultra-nationalists had been threatening ethnic Russians and driving them out of their homes and businesses -- the same accusations that Moscow used as a pretext to intervene in Crimea. Standing tall and surveying his trench lines, self-defense commander Fedorok was in no mood to listen to any assurances from Moscow. He said he was in no doubt: ""The Russian hordes are coming.""

"(CNN) -- A mother in Tampa, Florida has admitted in detail to killing her two teen-aged children, police said. Police checking on the family at the request of a relative found Julie K. Schenecker, 50, on the back porch of her home Friday morning, dressed in blood-covered clothing, according to a police statement. They found her son, Beau Powers Schenecker, 13, dead in the family's SUV, which had been parked in the garage, the statement said. Calyx Powers Schenecker, 16, was in an upstairs bedroom, also dead. ""She did tell us that they talked back, that they were mouthy,"" Tampa police spokeswoman Laura McElroy told CNN affiliate WTSP. ""But I don't think that will ever serve as an explanation to the rest of us of how you could take a child's life."" The woman shot her son as she drove him to soccer practice and returned home to shoot her daughter as she studied on her computer, CNN affiliate WFTS reported, citing investigators. The preliminary investigation indicates that the teens were killed on Thursday evening, a police statement said, but a medical county examiner will determine the time of death. Police have charged the mother in the killings, the police statement said. Police were called to the house after Schenecker's mother called from Texas to express concern about her daughter's welfare, saying she was depressed, the police statement said. Schenecker was initially booked into jail, but was transferred to Tampa General Hospital for treatment of an existing medical condition, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, WTSP reported. Hundreds of people attended a candlelight vigil on Friday night in memory of the siblings, according to WTSP. ""It's just sad that his mom did this to him and his sister because he didn't deserve this,"" one of the mourners, Hailey Johnson, told WTSP. ""He was the sweetest kid ever.""

"(CNN)Shannon Zwanziger seemed perfectly healthy. She was an active 17-year-old who rarely got sick and hadn't been to a doctor in more than three years. Then one day, she came home with the flu. She died a week later. Shannon is part of grim new statistics released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that the flu has reached an epidemic level in the United States this year. It's blamed for more deaths than it was at this time last year -- including 15 children. That's as of December 20. Already, more flu-related deaths are suspected, including a 4-year-old boy in Port Isabel, Texas, CNN affiliate KGNS reports. It's still early in the flu season, which often begins in early fall and persists through May, so it remains to be seen exactly how pervasive the flu will be. Passed out in her mother's arms, never came to . Shortly before she died on December 9, Shannon had worked her way -- slowly -- down the stairs at home by sitting and sliding down each step. She eventually made her way to the bathroom to take a bath. ""I helped her get in the bathtub, but when I saw her eyes, I said, 'I think this is a mistake -- we've got to get you out of here,' "" her grief-stricken mother, Gwen, in Owatonna, Minnesota, told CNN on Wednesday. ""She couldn't help me get her out. So I lifted her up, and she passed away in my arms."" Technically, Shannon was still alive, but she never regained consciousness. Zwanziger began administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and screamed for her husband, Terry, who called 911. Emergency medical workers rushed Shannon to a hospital, which found a slight heartbeat and flew her to a larger hospital. After a few hours, her heart stopped altogether. ""She was such an incredible kid,"" Gwen Zwanziger said by phone. ""She had her whole life planned out. She was living life to the fullest. If you're going to have the perfect kid, she was it."" Zwanziger had taken her daughter to a clinic at the hospital when she first became ill. She was told that her sickness was the flu and would run its course at home. The Zwanzigers cared for her, gave her liquids and did everything they were told. But Zwanziger says the family later learned that at some point, Shannon's liver gave out. And an autopsy confirmed that she had a type A flu. The CDC said that because of privacy rules, it can say only that there were two ""confirmed reports of flu-pediatric deaths in Minnesota this season."" It will be several more weeks before autopsy results show whether Shannon had an underlying health issue that the family was unaware of, Zwanziger says. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends an annual physical exam throughout childhood after the age of 4. But a study found that one third of Minnesota teens ages 13 to 17 had no preventive care visits, and another 40% had only one such visit during those years. Medical care not enough . When Shannon became sick, Zwanziger says, she got excellent medical care, but it wasn't enough. She wants more people suffering from symptoms to have blood tests. Shannon had not had the vaccine. Her father was vaccinated, but her mother was not because she had a bad reaction to a swine flu vaccine in the 1970s, she said. (""If a person has had a serious allergic reaction to flu vaccines in the past, this might be a contraindication to getting one, but they should talk with their doctor to understand if that reaction is relevant to the decision to get a vaccine now,"" says Dr. Joseph Bresee, chief of the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch of the CDC's Influenza Division.) The Zwanzigers gave their daughter a choice, and she chose to forgo the vaccine. It's unknown whether the vaccine would have saved her. Bad year for the vaccine . The CDC said it does not yet have information on how many of those killed by the flu this year were vaccinated. It's an unusually bad year for the vaccine. Just over half the strains tested were not covered by it. The biggest reason is a mutated strain that was not being spread at the time the vaccine was designed. Predicting the flu to help avoid it . Still, getting vaccinated is ""the best way to reduce the chances that you will get seasonal flu and spread it to others"" and ""may make your illness milder if you do get sick,"" according to the CDC. ""It's still about 61% effective,"" Dr. Seema Yasmin, a CNN medical analyst, said. ""Most flu vaccines protect against three or four different strains of flu actually, so even if it's not a great match against one particular strain, it will still protect you against the other strains that are going around right now."" Alarming numbers . While alarming, the latest statistics don't indicate that the outbreak this year will be, overall, worse than in previous years, the CDC told CNN on Wednesday. It's too early to know. Flu activity is high in nearly half the country -- 22 states and Puerto Rico, according to a map released by the CDC. An infectious disease specialist with the Inova health care system in Fairfax, Virginia, said medical staff has been busy. ""We've seen more patients than we anticipated,"" Dr. Sujata Ambardar told CNN affiliate WJLA. ""The hope is that things will stabilize, but I don't see it stopping anytime soon."" The ""epidemic threshold"" is crossed to some extent every year, a CDC chart shows. In the week ending December 20, nearly 7% of deaths were blamed on pneumonia and flu. That's higher than it was at the same time last year, but later on in the season, the percentage of deaths blamed on the flu generally goes higher. The number of children killed by the flu spiked tremendously in 2013. Thirty-seven deaths were blamed on the flu in the 2011 to 2012 season; the next season, 2012-2013, there were 171 deaths, the CDC says. In the 2013 to 2014 season, the figure was 109. The 2009 season, which stretched from April 2009 to October 2010 and included the H1N1 pandemic, saw 348 deaths. Totals are known for children but not adults because child deaths must be reported to the CDC; there's no similar requirement for adult deaths. Older people are generally those worst-affected. Flu-related hospitalizations among people 65 and older has reached 38.3 per 100,000 people, the highest rate of any age group, the CDC says. Flu activity generally peaks in the United States between December and February. The not knowing . Gwen Zwanziger says she did not catch the flu from her daughter, even after administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Mixed in with all the pain and grief the family is suffering is the frustration of not knowing how the death happened. ""I just cannot figure out why she died from this,"" the grieving mother says. CNN had contacted an online fundraising campaign for the Zwanziger family -- her parents and her sister, who is married and has a baby -- to learn more about the girl's death. Organizers got back in touch, saying Gwen Zwanziger wanted to talk and deliver a message: ""We need to take it more seriously. And you need to be really proactive."" CNN's Eve Bower and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Doctor says her medical group has seen more patients than expected .

It turns out Scalise addressed an anti-Semitic, white supremacist group back in 2002 run by none other than David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Klu Klux Klan who is well-known in Scalise's home state of Louisiana because of several statewide campaigns for governor and senator. A liberal Louisiana politics blogger revealed the encounter with the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO) after finding an account of Scalise's speech to the group on a white supremacist forum. The group is bad news for Scalise: it's been labeled as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which details the group's anti-semitic, racist views. The next day, reporters in D.C. were asking Scalise's office about the meeting and after aides first said it was ""probable"" and then ""likely"" the congressman spoke to the group, Scalise broke his silence in an interview with his local paper, The Times-Picayune of New Orleans. He said he didn't remember specifically addressing EURO, but said that at the time he ""went and spoke to any group that called"" in 2002 when he was trying to drum up support in opposing a state tax plan. And then Scalise released the ultimate mea culpa statement Tuesday afternoon, calling his appearance at the event ""a mistake I regret."" ""One of the many groups that I spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views I wholeheartedly condemn. It was a mistake I regret,"" Scalise said. Democrats must be eager to disrupt the Republican leadership. So given his admission, why isn't he at greater risk of losing his leadership position? Republicans have a lot at stake here and just months after solidifying a new leadership and days before taking on new-found power in Washington, keeping Scalise in the ranks as whip is the ideal for GOP leaders. And details of Scalise's appearance at the hate group's forum aren't giving too much credence to the theory that Scalise is a closeted bigot. And Scalise is touting his Catholic faith as a reason he wouldn't associate with white supremacists. They don't usually like Catholics either. With only one aide on his staff, Scalise conceded the regular vetting process fell through. And Kenny Knight, a longtime advisor to Duke, said he invited Scalise (who was his neighbor at the time) personally and insisted in an interview with the Washington Post that ""I don't think Scalise knew anything about EURO."" Knight said he and Scalise were friendly and Scalise knew him as the head of ""our civic association,"" but that they ""wouldn't talk about race or the Jewish question."" Sounds like the dots wouldn't have been too hard for Scalise to connect given Duke's notoriety. How could Scalise survive this scandal? While national Democrats have their targets set on Scalise -- including one statement from House Democrats' campaign arm that ""Scalise chose to cheerlead for a group of KKK members and neo-Nazis"" -- Scalise is getting some much-needed relief from a diverse group of fellow Louisiana politicos. The state's Indian American Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal was quick to fire off a statement calling Scalise ""a good man"" and expressing his confidence that Scalise ""absolutely rejects racism in all its forms."" And Democrats from the bayou state also rose to Scalise's defense. African-American Rep. Cedric Richmond, who will be the only Democrat from the state serving in Congress starting next week, jumped to Scalise's defense and said he would not ""let them use Steve as a scapegoat to score political points."" Former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards told the New York Times ""sometimes you end up in front of these groups through no fault of your own"" and the state's former Sen. Bennett Johnston said he knows Scalise didn't mean to address the white supremacist group. ""While it is sometimes fun to see Republicans in trouble, you'd be wrong to blame Representative Steve Scalise for being racist on account of addressing a meeting of European-American Unity and Rights Organization 'EURO' in 2002,"" Johnston, who is now a lobbyist in Washington, said in a statement. ""I know a lot about David Duke, who ran against me for the Senate in 1990, but I never knew that the 'EURO' was a racist organization. I may disagree with Representative Scalise but a racist he is not. Nor would he have been stupid enough to knowingly address a racist group."" What about Republican leadership? Are they putting a little skin in the game to save their pal? It looks that way. After about a day and a half of scrutiny and speculation, Scalise's superiors in the House Republican leadership showed their support for their now-embattled whip. House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement Scalise has his ""full confidence"" as whip despite making ""an error in judgment,"" followed shortly by a similar statement by his No. 2, Rep. Kevin McCarthy. Scalise brings back Boehner's familiar right flank hangover . But wait, aren't there some questions about whether Scalise actually even attended the event, after all? Remember Kenny Knight's account to the Post about the event? Knight has since changed his story considerably in his latest interviews with several media outlets. Knight told Slate that Scalise actually spoke to the local civic association in the same hotel space as the EURO meeting, before that meeting started. And in subsequent interviews with other reporters, details in Knight's recollection of the event 12 years ago have cropped up or changed. Is there anything else we should know about Scalise's past in regards to race relations? Scalise voted twice against making Martin Luther King, Jr. Day a state holiday in 1999 and 2004 as a state legislator. And in 1997 he voted against a bill prohibiting hate crimes based on race, class or sexual orientation, Politico reported. Scalise is and has clearly been aware of David Duke's white supremacist views, but that's not what he pointed to as the ""first and most important thing"" in a 1999 interview with Roll Call about why Duke wouldn't make a good congressional candidate. ""The novelty of David Duke has worn off,"" Scalise. ""The voters in this district are smart enough to realize that they need to get behind someone who not only believes in the issues they care about, but also can get elected. Duke has proven that he can't get elected, and that's the first and most important thing."" And New Orleans Advocate politics blogger Stephanie Grace says that Scalise once told her he was like David Duke without the baggage.","Rep.

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africa's police chief said Monday that violence directed at foreign nationals had killed 22 people over the past week. Police carry an unidentified Malawi national on an improvised stretcher after he was badly beaten in Reiger Park township. The attacks have been concentrated in Johannesburg's poorest areas, and many of the victims were Zimbabweans who have fled repression and dire economic circumstances. The Nelson Mandela Foundation issued a statement condemning the ""senseless violence"" that police say was sparked a week ago in Johannesburg's Alexandra Township. ""We join the rest of South Africa in deploring this violence,"" said Achmat Dangor, CEO of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, according to a statement released on Monday. ""Whatever the underlying causes they have to be addressed, but this senseless violence is not a solution."" Police said those behind the attacks accused the foreigners of stealing jobs, carrying out criminal activities and benefiting from social services -- such as free housing -- meant to benefit South Africans. iReport.com: Are you there? Send photos, video . Police arrested more than 200 people during the violence for offenses including rape, murder, robbery and theft. Police said at least one foreigner was burned alive over the weekend, while others had their houses torched, their shops looted and their possessions stolen. Many have sought refuge at police stations. Some women have told police they were raped as part of an effort to drive the immigrants out. South Africa's police director Govindsamy Mariemuthoo said 22 people had been killed in the past week. The Red Cross estimates some 3,000 more were displaced. The attacks were concentrated in some of the poorest parts of South Africa where locals are jobless, hungry and in need of basic services such as clean water, sanitation and housing. South African President Thabo Mbeki called for an investigation into the violence. He has been reluctant to describe it as xenophobic because many South Africans have criticized his government for not doing enough to deal with the crisis in neighboring Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is in the midst of an economic collapse, with nearly 80 percent unemployment and inflation estimated to be at 160,000 percent. In addition, it is also in a state of political limbo. A presidential runoff between long-time leader President Robert Mugabe and his opposition challenger Morgan Tsvangirai is scheduled for June 27 -- three months after the initial vote. Opposition leaders have accused the government of carrying out a campaign of political intimidation ahead of the runoff. The economic and political situation has seen an influx of Zimbabweans to South Africa, seeking a better life. Archbishop Desmond Tutu also condemned the violence and urged South Africans to remember the help that he and other anti-apartheid leaders received from neighboring countries. ""Although they were poor, they welcomed us South Africans as refugees, and allowed our liberation movements to have bases in their territory even if it meant those countries were going to be attacked by the SADF (South African Defense Forces),"" Tutu said. ""Please stop the violence now. This is not how we behave. These are our sisters and brothers. Please, please stop."" A South African military veterans' group plans to mobilize soldiers who fought against the country's former system of legalized racial separation ""to help educate the people ... about the role played by other African countries in securing South Africa's freedom."" ""Many brave comrades paid the ultimate price on African soil, but never at the hands of the people of those countries,"" according to a statement from the Military Veterans' Association in the Western Cape province. ""In the light of these facts, the xenophobic attacks witnessed in Gauteng (Province) over the past week -- and previously, against refugee traders in Cape Town -- are totally repugnant.""","At least 22 people killed by mobs targeting foreigners in Johannesburg .

"In the middle of his first congressional hearing as the new head of the embattled Internal Revenue Service, Daniel Werfel was asked Monday how he would restore public trust in the agency after revelations that conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status were targeted for extra scrutiny. ""It is going to be a difficult process,"" acknowledged Werfel, a career public servant appointed by President Barack Obama last month to clean up the mess that is dominating news headlines early in his second term. Werfel described a process of identifying what happened, who was responsible and steps to ensure it can never happen again to address what Republicans depict as politically motivated harassment that abused constitutional rights of conservative groups. 'Liar' charge a step too far for some Republicans . Democrats, while expressing outrage over the IRS targeting, reject Republican inferences that it was a broad political conspiracy reaching as high up as the White House. In addition to the targeting uncovered by a Treasury inspector general, a second audit coming out this week described improper spending on IRS conferences to buttress GOP portrayals of big government gone wild under Obama. The IRS spent close to $50 million on 225 conferences between 2010 and 2012, according to briefings given to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee by the inspector-general overseeing the IRS. One of those, an August 2010 meeting for 2,700 employees in Anaheim, California, cost $4 million, and the agency spent $50,000 to produce two videos that were shown at the event, including one with a ""Star Trek"" theme. In a response to the new audit, obtained by a congressional source, the IRS says it has cut training costs and reduced spending on meetings by 87% since 2010. ""The expenditures related to this 2010 meeting are not reflective of the current spending environment at the IRS or the spending that has occurred over the past several years,"" wrote Pamela LaRue, the agency's chief financial officer. But LaRue defended the need for large-scale conferences at the time. Nearly a third of managers in the division under scrutiny were inexperienced, and the agency faced added concerns about security after a Texas man crashed his plane into the IRS office in Austin, killing himself and two other people. ""Although the average cost per employee was reasonable, the IRS recognizes that a number of less significant costs warranted additional scrutiny and were not the best use of government resources,"" she wrote. IRS faces new battle on overspending . Rep. Hal Rogers, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee who sat in on his panel's Financial Service's subcommittee on Monday, made clear that he would assess the effectiveness and commitment by Werfel to uncover the source of the wrongdoing when considering IRS funding for next fiscal year. ""The power of the purse rests in the Congress, and we're prepared to use that purse to get to the truth,"" the Kentucky Republican said. Two more congressional hearings are scheduled for this week as Republicans seek to keep up the pressure on Obama and Democrats over the controversies. They follow three previous hearings by House and Senate panels, and the matter also is under investigation by the Justice Department, the Treasury inspector generals office and Werfel in his new capacity. A former Office of Management and Budget official, Werfel took over from former IRS Commissioner Steve Miller, who resigned under pressure after news of the targeting emerged. He described himself Monday as a fixer of problems in government. ""The IRS is an agency in need right now,"" Werfel said, adding that he took the job ""because I thought it could be helpful."" That didn't impress some Republicans on the Financial Services subcommittee, who expressed frustration with the lack of answers to their main question -- who ordered the targeting? Issa: Cincinnati IRS employees say direction came from Washington . Werfel said he also was frustrated and urged patience to allow the various investigations underway to work through the process. Both Werfel and J. Russell  George, the inspector general who conducted the audit that revealed the IRS targeting, repeated past assertions that the findings so far indicated gross mismanagement rather than political malfeasance. Read IRS watchdog's report . Meanwhile, White House spokesman Jay Carney sought to tone down the rhetoric over an increasingly bitter dispute with congressional Republicans over the issue. Asked by reporters about an accusation by House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa that he was a ""paid liar,"" Carney at first jokingly feigned ignorance, answering: ""I hadn't heard that. That's amazing."" As laughter erupted in the briefing room, Carney took a more serious tone. ""I am not going to get into a back-and-forth with"" Issa, he said, adding that the White House focus was on finding out what ""inappropriate activity"" occurred, hold responsible those at fault for ""inappropriate, outrageous activity"" and ensure it never happens again. It was a diplomatic effort to avoid prolonging headlines about harsh statements Sunday from Issa and a former White House official that escalated the controversy into a full-fledged Washington political imbroglio, including name-calling and references to decades-old allegations of wrongdoing. Carney brushes off Issa remark . Appearing on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Issa said Sunday that the White House was misleading the public about the full magnitude of the IRS targeting, in which some conservative groups seeking tax exempt status were singled out for extra scrutiny. In particular, he called Carney a ""paid liar"" and claimed that interviews with IRS officials in the Cincinnati office that considered requests for tax-exempt status showed that Washington officials were involved. However, he stopped short of providing proof of his claim, saying only that further investigation would reveal ""the whole truth."" In response, former White House adviser David Plouffe, a Democratic strategist, denied any political motivation in the IRS targeting. In a tweet posted later Sunday, Plouffe referred to Issa's comments as ""strong words from Mr Grand Theft Auto and suspected arsonist/insurance swindler."" By the Numbers: Internal Revenue Service . The tweet also called Issa ""loose ethically today,"" adding a link to a story about Issa's appearance on CNN. Plouffe's tweet referred to allegations from 1972 and 1982 against Issa, the former owner of a car alarm company. In 1972, then-19-year-old Issa was arrested under suspicion of stealing a car, but charges were ultimately dropped. Issa's brother, on the other hand, is a convicted car thief. In 1982, the office and factory of two companies Issa had purchased -- Quantum Enterprises and Steal Stopper International -- caught fire. The insurance company's investigation found ""suspicious burn patterns"" and company officials noted that in the month before the fire, Issa had increased his insurance from $100,000 to $462,000. Again, no criminal charges were filed. IRS investigation takes nasty turn .","Conference costs have been slashed since 2010, IRS says .

"(CNN) -- Iran has submitted an official request for two of its warships to sail through the Suez Canal, an Egyptian official told CNN Thursday, in a move that puts Egypt's new military regime in a prickly position with Israel. The post-Hosni Mubarak caretaker government must decide whether to give a green light to the Iranian warships, believed to be the first that would sail through the Suez since the Islamic republic's 1979 revolution. The Egyptian official told CNN that permission will likely be granted. But Egypt might find itself in muddy water over the Suez. The canal is an internal body of water and as such, Egypt has sovereignty over it. But Egypt also is bound by the 1976 Camp David Accords, which guaranteed the right of free passage by ships belonging to Israel and all other nations on the basis of the Constantinople Convention of 1888. Before that, Egypt did not allow Israeli ships to sail through the canal. Last week, Egypt's military government said it would honor all its international treaties. That would include Camp David. Now it finds itself in the position of allowing ships belonging to the sworn enemy of its peace treaty partner to sail through. ""This is awkward -- at a minimum,"" said David Schenker, director of the Program on Arab Politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Schenker said the Iranians want a frigate -- the Alvand -- and a military supply ship -- the Kharg -- to cross into the Mediterranean. Both are armed with missiles, he said. Their passage would create more uncertainty in the region. ""It's destabilizing. It raises tension, particularly in this time of transition in Egypt,"" Schenker said. ""This is typical of Syrian-Iranian opportunism."" Schenker predicted the Egyptians will let the Iranians through. Former President Hosni Mubarak might have done otherwise, given Hezbollah's calls a while back for his ouster. But, ""There is not a war between Iran and Egypt,"" he said. Get more from CNN.com Arabic . Some maritime analysts privately said Washington could pressure Egypt's new military caretaker government to say no to Iran. Washington agreed to a $13 billion, 10-year military aid package to Egypt in 2007. Egypt's decision, the analysts said, could serve as a barometer for the direction the military caretakers intend to take the Arab world's most populous nation. ""It does raise an unwelcome political issue that has to be resolved,"" said Cmdr. James Kraska of the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island. Ahmed El-Manakhly, the transit director of the Suez Canal Authority, had said earlier Thursday that no official request from Iran had been received. Warships planning to cross the canal must ask permission of Egypt's defense and foreign ministries, El-Manakhly said. The canal authority's website states that ships intending to sail northbound must be in place by 6 a.m. No Iranian ships were there Thursday, but Iran's state-run Press TV reported the warships were making their way from the Red Sea toward the Mediterranean. Iran said earlier that the flotilla was on a yearlong intelligence-gathering and training mission to prepare young cadets to defend Iran's cargo ships and oil tankers, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said the two Iranian military vessels had been expected to sail Wednesday night through the Suez on their way to Syria. ""This is a provocation that proves that the self-confidence and insolence of the Iranians is growing from day to day,"" he said Wednesday. ""This happens after the Iranian president's visit to south Lebanon and his aggressive declarations there towards Israel."" Liberman did not mention Egypt by name but said Israel's allies should pay close attention to the situation. ""We expect the international community to act speedily with determination against the Iranian provocations, designed to deteriorate the situation in the area, and put the Iranians in their place,"" he said. The Israeli Defense Ministry said Israel was monitoring the movement of the Iranian ships and alerted its allies. At the U.S. State Department, spokesman P.J. Crowley said Wednesday the United States is also watching the situation. Reports of the Iranian passage also sent jitters through the global market and oil prices spiked for a time on Wednesday. The Suez Canal serves as a key waterway for international trade, allowing ships to navigate between Europe and Asia without having to go all the way around the vast African continent. Millions of barrels of oil move through the Suez every day on the way to both Europe and North America. CNN's Kevin Flower, Saad Abedine, Fionnuala Sweeney and Zain Verjee contributed to this report.","Iran has submitted a request for two ships to sail through the Suez Canal .

"President Barack Obama traveled to his adopted hometown of Chicago on Tuesday to continue his week-long campaign of garnering support for his executive action on immigration reform, but he led his speech by remarking on the deadly riots in Ferguson. ""The frustrations that we've seen are not just about a particular incident. They have deep roots in many communities of color who have a sense that our laws are not being enforced uniformly or fairly,"" the President said. Moving on to the immigration issue, Obama touched on the reasons he signed the executive order last week that would allow millions of immigrants to stay in the country. He also made the argument that if Congress wants to repeal his orders, they should just, ""pass a bill."" RELATED: Obama: 'No sympathy' for violence in Ferguson . He referred to the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate, but has little hope of being brought up in the Republican-controlled House, saying, ""A year and a half ago, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill to fix this system."" ""We would have doubled the number of border patrol agents,"" Obama said. ""We would have made our legal immigration system smarter and fairer. It would have given millions of people the right to earn their citizenship."" But, he added, ""For a year and a half, Republican leaders in the House simply would not allow a vote.""​ . The President reiterated that this executive action is just the beginning of the change he would like to see and that he believes his actions are legal, adding that both Presidents Reagan and Bush issued executive orders on the immigration issue. Obama was briefly interrupted by three immigration activists who heckled him, calling him the ""deporter-in-chief."" ""It doesn't make sense to yell at me right now,"" he said.

"It took years and a good bit of detective work by art experts and scientists to unveil a painting hidden underneath Pablo Picasso's 1901 masterpiece ""The Blue Room."" Using infrared technology, experts at The Phillips Collection in Washington discovered a portrait of a bearded man wearing a jacket and a bow tie, his face resting on his hand, with three rings on his fingers. Curators and conservators there have been working with a team of experts from the National Gallery of Art, Cornell University and the Winterthur Museum in Delaware to analyze the painting and try to identify the mystery man in the work. ""This painting 'The Blue Room' is very important in (Picasso's) early work. It's considered an early Blue Period painting,"" Patricia Favero, associate conservator at the Phillips, said of the period early in the artist's career when he produced often melancholy, mostly monochromatic paintings in shades of blue. ""To find this painting underneath -- which we think was painted in the same year, just earlier in the year and it's completely different in style -- it gives us some insight into Picasso's development over the course of that year."" Picasso's Blue Period was an experimental time during which the young artist was trying to figure out his style, Favero explained. Understanding more about the work that lies underneath this famed masterwork and others will help art historians learn more about Picasso's development as a young artist. ""It just gives us a whole other body of work to look at,"" she said. ""The Blue Room"" has been part of The Phillips Collection since 1927. For decades, experts have wondered whether the painting might hide another work. A 1954 letter from a conservator working with Duncan Phillips, the museum's founder, noted a difference in the texture of the paint and his suspicion that there might be a painting underneath. Technology played a key role in uncovering the hidden portrait. When the painting was loaned to The National Gallery of Art in the 1990s, the gallery X-rayed the painting, revealing an image underneath. It wasn't until 2008, when more advanced infrared technology was available, that the Phillips was able to take a clearer picture, revealing the bearded mystery man. Picasso's grandson raffles off painting to save ancient city . ""We've had infrared technology since the '50s or even before, and in the '90s we had fairly decent infrared technology, but the technology has certain improved over the last 10 or more years,"" Favero said. ""The technology had improved such by 2008 that in our small lab, here with our little camera, we were able to get the image that you see."" The Phillips enlisted the help of scientists and Picasso experts who have been working since then to analyze the pigments and understand the different palettes of the painting and to confirm that it was painted by Picasso, Favero said. The team hopes to figure out who the man was, but because the portrait was painted early in Picasso's career, before he began keeping records, identifying the subject could be difficult. ""This is turn of the century Paris. This is presumably in Montmartre where Picasso had the studio, and the challenges are if there's no documentation existing to tell us -- a letter, even a drawing with an inscription -- the challenge is to find a picture,"" Favero said. ""I'm not sure what other documentation exists in terms of papers letter other drawings. We've enlisted the help of other art historians and art experts to help us with that."" Picasso has been known to paint over his work before, possibly to save money or to paint over a work that had not sparked buyer interest. ""It was a period in his life when he was broke and he needed to repurpose canvasses,"" The Phillips' associate curator Susan Frank explained. ""Picasso is an artist who worked so quickly and had so many ideas that reusing these canvasses to capture a current idea was part of his process."" ""The Blue Room"" is part of a tour to South Korea until early 2015. The Phillips is planning an exhibition around ""The Blue Room"" in 2017. 16 artist hangouts you can still go to .

"Drones both dazzled and worried senators at a hearing Wednesday about their use within the United States, and lawmakers and experts said that new legislation may be needed to protect the privacy and safety of citizens. Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, held and studied a small plane weighing just 2 pounds before beginning the hearing. ""I am convinced that the domestic use of drones to conduct surveillance and collect other information will have a broad and significant impact on the everyday lives of millions of Americans,"" said Leahy. Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the panel, said the technology may require lawmakers to develop a new definition of an unreasonable search, which is banned under the Constitution's Fourth Amendment. Opinion: Don't give medals for drone attacks . ""The thought of government drones buzzing overhead monitoring the activities of law-abiding citizens runs contrary to the notion of what it means to live in a free society,"" Grassley said. The small aircraft can be fitted with lightweight cameras. Amie Stepanovich, of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said law enforcement should not use drones as an alternative to police patrols. She said that they should be used for specific operations and that Congress should pass a law requiring legal permission. ""I think we do need to enforce a warrant requirement for drones in circumstances where they're collecting criminal evidence,"" Stepanovich said.  She said exceptions could be made for emergencies. ""With the ease and availability of drones, I think there is a real concern that the day-to-day conduct of American citizens going about their business might be monitored, catalogued and recorded by the federal government,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Privacy laws need to be updated to account for drones and other new technologies, according to Ryan Calo, of the University of Washington Law School. Five questions: Targeting Americans on U.S. soil . ""There's very little in American privacy law that would limit the domestic use of drones for surveillance,"" Calo said. Calo said he thinks the aircraft can be extremely beneficial but warned that Americans may oppose their use unless there are some limits. An industry representative said the federal government already is regulating unmanned aircraft systems, the name industry uses for the aircraft. ""The (Federal Aviation Administration) strictly regulates who, where, when and why unmanned aircraft will be flown,"" said Michael Toscano, president and CEO of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International. He said operators of planes must get a certificate of authorization from the FAA, and the craft are to be flown under 400 feet and primarily in daytime hours. The FAA is supposed to allow widespread use of domestic drones in 2015. There is only limited use by civilians at present. Because they are cheaper to use than helicopters, unmanned aircraft can be used to monitor crops and livestock, look at damage to buildings and for other uses.  The FAA recently announced plans to create six drone test sites around the country. The Mesa County Sheriff''s Office in Colorado already uses drones. Benjamin Miller said the craft can help find missing people and photograph crime scenes. Miller noted it's not legal to arm domestic drones. ""It may well not be legal to carry any munitions on a drone,"" said Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-California. ""But what can be done illegally, and how can the government prevent that from happening?"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, expressed concern that as drones are more commonly used, they could be involved in accidents. ""What would happen if one of them hit a small plane?"" asked Klobuchar. ""Like when birds hit a plane, it can create problems."" Toscano replied, ""If there were a collision, then there could be damage."" Drone came within 200 feet of airliner over New York .","Increasing use of drones in U.S. raises privacy concerns at Senate hearing .

"Dave Brat, an economics professor and former seminary student, pulled off the biggest political upset of the year by ousting the No. 2 House Republican Eric Cantor in a primary challenge on Tuesday night. ""This is the happiest moment, obviously, of my life,"" Brat told his supporters at a post-election event in Glen Allen, outside Richmond, on Tuesday night. ""The reason we won this campaign, there is just one reason, and that's because dollars do not vote -- you do."" Brat, who raised less than $300,000 to the House majority leader's campaign war chest of $5.4 million, said, ""It's not about David Brat winning tonight, it's about returning the country to its principles."" Just how surprising were the results? A close ally of Brat's told CNN shortly before the results were in that he was ""shocked"" and that senior campaign officials didn't believe he could pull in more than 40% of the vote. Brat ended up besting Cantor 56%-44%. Cantor's team included some veteran Virginia political hands while some of Brat's top campaign staffers hadn't worked on a major campaign before. Many political pundits were quick to credit the tea party for boosting Brat's campaign, but his campaign did not get any significant financial support from conservative groups because they were funneling money into other primary challengers they believed had a better shot at beating GOP incumbents. Opinion: Who said the tea party was dead? 'A shock on your hands' In an interview a day before the vote, Brat made a prediction most political candidates make to try to energize their supporters, telling CNN, ""On Tuesday you're going to have a shock on your hands."" Brat joked that he expected to see a CNN van in his driveway to cover his victory on Wednesday. Brat's main argument in the race was that Cantor lost touch with his conservative principles. He told CNN, ""My beef with Cantor isn't not a right- or left wing thing."" Citing his expertise on economics, Brat said the GOP leader and other top congressional Republicans in Washington had set aside their ""free market principles"" when they backed the bailout legislation that helped bolster Wall Street banks after the fiscal crisis in 2008. But the longshot candidate centered most of his attacks against Cantor on the issue of immigration, arguing that the majority leader's support for small measures allowing some type of legal status for children of undocumented immigrants was ""amnesty.""  Much of the media coverage about the race focused on Brat's attacks that Cantor wasn't pushing the conservative position. Cantor worked to reassure Republicans that he would not allow any legislation to come up for a vote that provided ""amnesty.""  He sent out mailers to Republicans in the district with the message ""conservative Republican Eric Cantor is stopping the Obama Reid plan to give illegal aliens amnesty."" But Brat told CNN the issue of ""amnesty"" resonated more than other issues like Obamacare and jobs ""because it shows Eric flip-flopping and being unprincipled."" Jack Trammell is the Democrat who no longer has to face Eric Cantor . Ad spending . In addition to the top GOP leaders' position on immigration, Brat repeatedly touted his experience as an economist, and criticized both political parties for ignoring proposals to address Medicare and Social Security. ""Neither side of the aisle will talk about the most important issues because that is going to involve pain."" While he is a political neophyte, Brat has served on state and local government boards and was a president of the Virginia Association of Economists. Despite being the overwhelming favorite, there were signs that Cantor's campaign sensed a threat. It spent more than $1 million on television and radio ads that attempted to paint Brat as a liberal. They noted that he was appointed to one of those boards by then-Democratic Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine. But Brat argued that Cantor's aggressive ad spending did him the favor of boosting his name identification around the district at a time when he didn't have the resources to run his own ads. Brat, 49, grew up in the Midwest and moved to Henrico in 1996 to begin teaching economics and ethics at Randolph-Macon College, a small liberal arts institution. He has chaired the school's Economics and Business department for the past six years. He and his wife Laura have two children. Graham defeats conservative challengers, avoids runoff .

"The Vatican said Wednesday it has suspended a German bishop who has come under fire for his extravagant  lifestyle. Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst is under investigation for his spending after his residence in Limburg, Germany, was renovated for $42 million. The Vatican says Tebartz-van Elst cannot carry out his ministry as long as the investigation in ongoing, and he's been ordered to stay outside his diocese. Called the ""Bling Bishop,"" Tebartz-van Elst, who is known as theologically conservative, has denied any wrongdoing, saying the cost overruns on the renovation are legitimate because surrounding structures had to be protected, including the old city wall. But many people in Limburg and elsewhere want the bishop to step down. ""He built his office on lies,"" said Limburg resident Patrick Dehm. ""This must come to an end. The diocese doesn't deserve this."" For papal biographer Marco Politi it's not that simple. ""The Pope is sending Bishop Tebartz-van Elst into exile for two months,"" he told CNN affiliate RTL. ""That is indeed a punishment, but a lot now depends on what the investigating committee will say."" Some German media have come down hard on the bishop, with Der Spiegel criticizing him for taking a first-class flight to India, where he visited with the poor. Tebartz-van Elst said that he had gotten an upgrade and that he's no fan of champagne or caviar. For his latest  trip to the Vatican, he reportedly flew on a budget airline.

"The saying goes: ""Time heals all wounds."" And for most former U.S. presidents, that appears to be true. After leaving the constant scrutiny of the White House, a president's legacy begins to take shape as professors, biographers and presidential historians start to take long, reflective looks at the president's time in office. And that prism generally makes them look better.. ""History has a way of making presidents, in most cases, look better than they looked during their administration,"" said James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. George W. Bush, whose library opened on Thursday, is in the middle of that sort of mini-renaissance -- the number of people who see his presidency as a failure, according to a recent CNN/ORC poll, is down 13 points since he left office. And he's not unique in that sense -- a Gallup poll released Thursday showed presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton all with an improved approval rating in retirement. Five presidents on hand for Bush library ceremonies . But why does this happen? Historians say a number of factors -- from the way the president left office to the human tendency to forgive -- contribute to how the former leader is viewed. And while all of these factors don't apply to every president, the historians say a combination of these factors play into how a retired commander-in-chief is perceived. How did you leave the White House? When President Herbert Hoover exited the White House in 1933, the country was in the midst of the Great Depression. When James Buchanan left after one term, his polices to maintain peace between the North and South had failed and the Civil War was imminent. And when President Richard Nixon resigned the White House in 1974 because of the Watergate scandal, the former Republican lawmaker left as a disgraced public figure. According to David Nichols, a presidential historian and expert on President Dwight Eisenhower, the way a president exits the White House plays a big role in how their leadership is remembered. ""If something cataclysmic happens just before they leave office, they end up having a tough time recovering,"" Nichols said. Most people, said Nichols, have very little recollection of the specifics of a former president, so the most memorable moments are what stick. Although Nixon may have helped normalize relations with China when he became the first president to visit the Communist country, and established the Environmental Protection Agency, Nichols said, what people remember is his resignation speech, his final wave to the White House and the phrase ""I am not a crook."" ""In many respects, if you look at Nixon's record, he was a fairly successful president,"" Nichols said. ""The problem for Nixon was the way he left the presidency."" Bush 43 reflects on his presidency . What did you do after the White House? Two years after having lost the White House to Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter established the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta in 1982. Dedicated to democracy and human rights, the center has helped Carter's reputation so much that Edward Berkowitz, professor of History at George Washington University, said that Carter may have more respect now than he had when he lost the White House. ""It matters how you handle your post-presidency,"" Berkowitz said. ""Carter is the ace figure to that. Carter had very low approval when he left office but sort of transformed himself."" A report by The Miller Center at the University of Virginia notes a similar phenomenon for Carter. Though Carter was the first incumbent president to lose the presidency in half a century, ""to many people, Jimmy Carter has provided Americans with an ideal model of post-presidential life."" ""In fact, some consider him to be the nation's greatest former president,"" the report said. The successful former president is a more modern tradition, when presidents have a longer life expectancy than their predecessors. Two other modern presidents who have benefited from life after the White House: George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Clinton left office beleaguered by the Monica Lewinsky scandal but reinvented himself into a Democratic kingmaker of sorts. With his wife now a former secretary of state and his support of President Barack Obama through the 2012 election, Clinton's image has benefited from life after the Oval Office. And the first of the two Bushes elected to the White House has also seen his image improve, Berkowitz said. ""When he was defeated in 1992, his legacy looks unclear. Now he seems like this compassionate guy and his image improved during his son's presidency,"" he said. Remembering 43: 'Bush tended to... follow strong people' Libraries also make the president look good . Ever since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt donated his personal and presidential papers to the federal government in 1939, the tradition of the presidential library has blossomed. Part library, part museum, part tribute, each presidential library is a testament to the time each former president spent in the White House. And according to Thurber, libraries help rehabilitate a presidential image. ""These libraries, I think, are bias,"" Thurber said. ""They want to protect the history, but they also want to make the president look good."" One of Thurber's examples: ""If you go to the Truman library, there is only one small newspaper article that describes the fact that he was the one who decided to use the atomic bomb. That is probably the most important thing in his administration and it is sort of hidden. He and those protecting his image don't want that to be the major thing."" So far, there are 13 official presidential libraries in the United States with a handful that are not recognized by National Archives. Nichols echoed Thurber by saying ""the presidential library undoubtedly helps."" The reason: the public tends to be more forgiving when they see the accomplishments of a presidency laid out in front of them. ""Historians just love to tell good stories,"" Nichols said. ""Outside of Hitler and a few other people, historians hate to make people just sound awful."" He concluded: ""It is almost in the interest of people in my profession to find good things about people and underline and them.""","Image of most recent presidents improved after they left office .
How they left the White House plays a large part in image rehabilitation .

"Surabaya, Indonesia (CNN)Indonesian searchers battling bad weather in their efforts to find more remains from AirAsia Flight QZ8501 have so far recovered seven bodies from the sea, officials said Wednesday. A day after the first bits of debris from the commercial jet were spotted afloat off the coast of Borneo, the search operation was hampered Wednesday by big waves, strong winds and heavy rain. Helicopters scanning for signs of wreckage and victims were halted in their search, while ships continued combing the waters. It was unclear how long aerial operations would be held up. Answers about why the aircraft, with 162 people on board, fell from the sky Sunday remained elusive. Among the seven bodies recovered so far -- not 10, as earlier reports had indicated -- was that of a woman wearing a flight attendant's uniform, said Bambang Soelistyo, Indonesia's national search and rescue chief. ""Reality of seeing the evacuees and some of my aircraft parts are soul destroying,"" AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted. The air executive also put to rest rumors of a survivor found in a life jacket, saying that only the life jacket was found in the water. Sonar may have detected wreckage . There was conflicting information about whether any parts of the plane had been found underwater. One search official told CNN that he believes sonar equipment has detected wreckage from the plane at the bottom of the sea but couldn't confirm it. ""I think that that's the case,"" said Muhammad Hernanto, the head of search and rescue for Surabaya, the Indonesian city where Flight 8501 began its journey Sunday. But in a news conference Wednesday, Fernandes denied this, saying sonar imaging has yet to detect anything. ""Search and rescue teams are doing a fantastic job. They are narrowing the search and they are feeling more comfortable they are beginning to know where it is. But there is no confirmation of them. No sonar ... nothing"" Soelistyo was also cautious, denying reports that searchers had found the plane's main fuselage. ""Until now, we haven't found the plane,"" he said, according to Indonesia's national news agency Antara. Search teams are looking for other bodies and parts of the plane, including its so-called black boxes. Those could help investigators determine what went wrong on the flight, which lost contact with air traffic controllers after the pilot asked to change course and move to a higher altitude because of bad weather. How can a modern airliner vanish? Bodies returned to flight's departure city . The difficult weather conditions were making it harder to get all the bodies that have been recovered back to land. Two of the corpses arrived at a hospital in Surabaya on Wednesday afternoon after being airlifted from a city nearer the search site. The bodies were given a solemn welcome by roughly 100 military personnel. Preparations have been made in Surabaya to receive and identify the human remains in the coming hours and days. Dozens of ambulances were lined up. On the grounds of a police hospital stood several refrigerated shipping containers where bodies will be stored while awaiting examination. Nearby, tents were pitched with gurneys on hand. Debris and some bodies were found Tuesday 100 to 200 kilometers (about 60 to 120 miles) from the aircraft's last known location over the Java Sea, Indonesia's search and rescue agency said. The news came as a devastating blow for family members of passengers, who had been waiting anxiously for information about their loved ones for days. The suffering was made worse for some of them, when they saw live television pictures of a corpse in the water. Anguish revisited: Relatives of MH370 victims speak out about AirAsia QZ8501 . Families still want and expect regular and full updates from authorities, Suyone Thejakusuma, who said he had relatives and friends on the flight, told CNN on Wednesday. A new information center for families was being set up Wednesday next to a police station in Surabaya. International search effort . Several nations are contributing resources to the effort, including the United States, Singapore and Malaysia. The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Sampson is already supporting the search and recovery operations. The USS Fort Worth is also being prepared to deploy from Singapore, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. It ""can be ready to sail in a day or two to get on station and can be there very quickly,"" he said. The United States is also preparing maritime patrol aircraft that could help, he said. The flight, which was lost Sunday on its way to Singapore, was carrying 155 passengers and seven crew members. The overwhelming majority were Indonesians. There were also citizens of Britain, France, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea aboard. Flight 8501 was operated by AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph reported from Surabaya, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's David Molko, Andrew Stevens, Mitra Mobasherat, Gary Tuchman, Brian Walker, Catherine E.

"U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon made an urgent plea as a donor conference to rebuild Gaza kicked off Sunday morning in Cairo. ""The cycle of building and destroying must end,"" Ban said in his opening remarks. ""Donors may be fatigued, but the people of Gaza are bruised and bloody.  Enough is enough."" He said he hoped this would be the last Gaza reconstruction conference. ""It is time to chart a course to a just and final peace between Israelis and Palestinians -- one that addresses all the outstanding issues,"" he said. The U.N. chief plans to visit Gaza on Tuesday to listen directly to its people and survey the situation. He will also visit Israel. Rebuilding Gaza after this year's conflict with Israel will cost $4 billion, says the Palestinian Authority, which is presenting a reconstruction plan Sunday. The governments of Egypt and Norway are hosting the Cairo conference to help raise the funds needed, according to Egypt's Foreign Affairs Ministry. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Deputy Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa will be joined by some of the world's most powerful diplomats, including the foreign ministers of Japan, France and Italy. They will speak about the challenges of rebuilding and how to approach the international response. Multiple global aid organizations are also participating. Officials announce aid to Gaza . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced an additional $212 million in aid to rebuild Gaza, shortly after he arrived in Cairo early Sunday. The money doubles the amount already pledged, bringing the total U.S. contribution to $414 million. Kerry said that raising funds should not be the only goal of the conference. ""I say clearly and with deep conviction here today, the United States remains fully and totally committed to returning to negotiations not just for the sake of it, but because the goal of this conference and the future of the region demand it,"" he said. He called for long-term investments in the Palestinian economy to create a vibrant private sector. Qatar announced a $1 billion dollar donation Sunday. ""Well, I think it won't simply be Qatar pledging money; all the other Arab countries will pledge money as well,"" former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a Middle East Quartet representative, told CNN's Becky Anderson. He said the money would go through the right channels. ""If the Palestinian Authority as envisaged are in charge of that  process of reconstruction, this money will go through them, will go through a proper treasury account properly administered,"" Blair said. ""So we are taking a lot of painstaking efforts to make sure the money goes for the purpose for which it was intended and goes to benefit the people in Gaza."" The Quartet is an informal diplomatic group made up of officials from the United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia. It aims to promote Middle East peace and Palestinian development. Israeli response . Israel was not invited to the conference, but that does not mean that it wants to prevent the reconstruction of Gaza, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said in an interview with Israel Radio on Sunday . Lieberman said that it was important that funds raised in Cairo not be used to produce weapons or build tunnels in Gaza. He added that it was up to Palestinians to prevent another operation in Gaza. ""We are not looking for adventures, but if the rocket is renewed, Israel has a right to defend itself,"" he said. Operation Protective Edge . Israel launched Operation Protective Edge in Gaza in July, saying the military operation was aimed at stopping Hamas rocket attacks and destroying a network of tunnels that extended under the border with Israel. More than 2,130 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed in Gaza during the 50 days of fighting that followed. The United Nations estimates that more than 70% were civilians, but Israel reports a higher number of militants among the dead. Sixty-eight people were killed on the Israeli side, two of whom were civilians. Many homes, schools and other buildings in Gaza were destroyed or damaged before a ceasefire was reached in late August. The United Nations estimates that 60,000 Gazans were still living in shelters in late September.","U.N. secretary-general: ""The  cycle of building and destroying must end""

"(CNN) -- Are those airline baggage and cancellation fees taking a bite out of your wallet? They're certainly making money for U.S. airlines, which collected $6.16 billion last year: $3.35 billion in baggage fees and $2.81 billion in reservation change fees, according to U.S. Department of Transportation data released Monday. That's a slight increase from $6.04 billion collected in 2012. Those ancillary fees helped the 26 passenger U.S. airlines make a net profit of $12.7 billion in 2013, up from a profit of $98 million in 2012. Delta Air Lines topped the list, collecting $1.67 billion last year: $840 million in reservation change/cancellation fees and $833 million in baggage fees. United Airlines came in second place, with $1.38 billion in fees: $756 million in reservation cancellation/change fees and nearly $625 million in baggage fees. And the world's best airport is ... The new airline created by the merger of American Airlines and U.S. Airways, which are still reporting their data separately, would have topped the list if their fees were added together. The combined airline collected more than $1 billion in baggage fees and $848 million in reservation cancellation and change fees. Reporting as two airlines, American ranked third in the reservation cancellation and change fee category, collecting $521 million in fees, while US Airways came in fourth place with $327 million. U.S. Airways was third for baggage fees with $528 million, while American collected $506 million to come in fourth. American was the first U.S. airline to charge customers to check bags in June 2008, for a fee of $15. That year, American collected $277,991 in baggage fees, according to Department of Transportation data. Other U.S. airlines quickly followed suit, and as a group they collected $1.1 million that year. Fees have since crept up; American now charges $25 for the first checked bag, with some exceptions. .

"If you're looking for an industry that's thriving even during these tough economic times, look to the hair industry. It may be the closest thing to recession-proof. According to Census data, the number of barbershops in Maryland rose nearly 11% between 2007 -- when the recession hit -- and 2009, while the number of beauty salons in the state jumped more than 17%. Nationwide, there were 18.6% more barber shops and 14.4% more beauty salons in 2009 than in 2007. ""Barbering is definitely on the upswing. We see it in our schools. The enrollment is up,"" said Derek Davis, a vice president of the National Association of Barber Boards of America. ""We've seen an increased number of people taking the exam to get licensing."" Tarsa Scott, a real estate agent turned stylist at Fabulocs, a natural hair salon in suburban Maryland, chalked up the sector's strength to one thing: the desire to look and feel good. ""Most people -- especially women -- even when there are bad times, we want to feel good,"" said Scott, who got an office job after the housing market collapsed, but turned to hair styling to supplement her income. ""We're not going to sacrifice feeling beautiful just because we're in a bad situation."" Janice Washington, who comes to the salon every three weeks or so, said she has stopped spending as much money on shoes in order to keep getting her hair done.  ""It's a necessity, because I do want to keep my hair looking like it's well-maintained."" Fabulocs owner Nimat Bilal said business has always been strong and is only getting better. It's a job that cannot be outsourced. It has to be done locally. ""I've never felt the economy with the business I'm in,"" Bilal said. In another sign of the effect the recession has had on even educated workers in other industries, seven of the nine stylists at Fabulocs have college degrees. Bilal works just three days a week and makes enough money to survive. She also trains stylists like Scott, with the help of her sister Aisha, who has a master's degree in education. She lost her job at a nonprofit in 2009. ""A lot of the ladies that work here, some of them were clients who lost their jobs and they saw business was good and wanted to know how they could get involved,"" Bilal said. Scott began working at Fabulocs after completing a six-month training course. She now plans to quit her office job. She's one of several stylists at the salon who spent years working in other professions before turning to hairstyling during the economic downturn. Two years ago, as other industries struggled, Bilal moved to a larger space to accommodate the growing number of people who wanted to work with her. She rents booths to the stylists, who use them to run their own mini-salons, building their own clientele and marketing their skills. ""This is the business to be in. It's consistent and it's growing,"" Bilal said.","The number of barbershops and beauty salons rose between 2007 and 2009 .

"London (CNN)A Scottish woman diagnosed with Ebola is now asking for experimental treatment of the virus. Pauline Cafferkey, 39, of Glasgow, is sitting up in her hospital bed, reading and talking, according to a statement from the Royal Free Hospital in London. ""However, the next few days will be crucial,"" said  Dr. Michael Jacobs, an infectious diseases consultant. ""The disease has a variable course and we will know much more in a week's time."" Cafferkey is the first person to be diagnosed with the virus on UK soil. British media outlets have said she is a public health nurse who was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to Sierra Leone in West Africa by the UK government last month in a joint endeavor with Save the Children. She traveled via Casablanca, Morocco, and London Heathrow Airport before arriving at Glasgow Airport on a British Airways flight late Sunday, the health agency NHS Scotland said. After feeling unwell, she sought medical attention and was reportedly transferred to London on a military aircraft fitted with an isolation pod. The Royal Free Hospital is equipped with a high-level isolation unit, with access restricted to specially trained medical staff. A specially designed tent, with controlled ventilation, is set up over the patient's bed. A British volunteer nurse, William Pooley, was successfully treated in the unit following his return home from Sierra Leone in August after being diagnosed with Ebola. 'Extremely low' risk . UK authorities are working to trace those who have come into contact with Cafferkey. The Scottish government has set up a special number for people to call if they traveled on the same London Heathrow-to-Glasgow flight as Cafferkey. British Airways said it was working closely with health authorities in England and Scotland and would help with any information needed. ""The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority and the risk to people on board that individual flight is extremely low,"" the airline said. Ebola patients become infectious only after they display symptoms, such as fever and vomiting. The deadly virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids. A Downing Street spokesman told CNN that British Prime Minister David Cameron and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had discussed the procedures in place to handle such a case. ""They agreed that both governments would remain in close touch and ensure everything possible was done to support the patient and, although the risk to the general population remained low, all measures would be taken to protect public health."" Scottish woman tests negative . Meanwhile, a woman in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland who'd fallen ill tested negative for Ebola, the Scottish government said Tuesday. A spokesman for the government said the woman had been in West Africa recently, though she had no direct contact with anyone with Ebola. ""A patient at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary has tested negative for Ebola,"" a Tuesday news release said. ""The individual was transferred to the hospital by the Scottish Ambulance Service yesterday after falling ill while visiting Torridon in the Scottish Highlands."" According to UK government guidelines, humanitarian workers returning from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa who've been at high risk of exposure are expected to monitor their own health for 21 days after they get home. As of December 24, at least 7,693 people had died in the current Ebola outbreak, centered in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the World Health Organization said. There have been at least 19,695 cases. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","A health care worker diagnosed with the virus is asking for experimental drug therapy .

"An attempted military coup took place in the remote and mountainous nation of Lesotho on Saturday, Prime Minister Thomas Thabane said in an interview aired by South African broadcaster eNCA. ""In my political life, it was not the first time that I saw this kind of activity by the Lesotho army,"" Thabane said. A lot of effort has been made to reform the military and to ""make it a normal army that is subject to the civilian authority,"" he said. Sometimes referred to as the ""Kingdom of the Sky,"" Lesotho is completely landlocked by South Africa and is the only country in the world where all of the land lies above 1,000 meters. It  has a population of nearly 2 million and covers an area slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Maryland, according to the World Factbook. The Lesotho government is seeking the assistance of the South African government and other neighboring states, Thabane said. The Prime Minister said that since the Lesotho military was looking for him, he decided ""to get out of the way,"" and fled to an unknown location. He told the broadcaster he would not resign. ""We can't have coups d'etat in 2014. If there are political problems people must sit (down) and talk,"" said Clayson Monyela, a spokesman for the South African Foreign Ministry. Monyela said that the Lesotho military's actions ""bear the hallmarks of a coup d'état."" Kamalesh Sharma, secretary-general of the Commonwealth of Nations, condemned the reported coup attempt and urged the military in Lesotho to respect civilian authority, constitutional order and the rule of law. ""There is zero tolerance in the Commonwealth of any unconstitutional overthrow of an elected government,"" he said in a statement. ""Democracy and the rule of law are central tenets of our association ... and any action to subvert constitutional civilian rule is unacceptable."" Lesotho has been independent of the United Kingdom since 1966, but continues on as a member of the 53-nation Commonwealth. Thabane became Prime Minister in 2012, when he formed the kingdom's first coalition government, according to the CIA World Factbook. Elections are next due in 2017. Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said the United States ""is deeply concerned by clashes between security forces today in Lesotho."" Psaki called upon all parties to ""remain committed to a peaceful political dialogue and to follow democratic processes"" in order to resolve the conflict. Lesotho is known for its ""herd boys,"" children as young as 5 who tend flocks of cattle in remote locations and often miss out on education. Prince Harry established a charity, Sentebale, to help the country meet educational challenges.","Lesotho is a mountainous nation of 2 million landlocked by South Africa .

"(Life by DailyBurn ) -- You just crushed a really hard workout. You upped the load of your training, or you stepped out of your routine and tried a new activity. You feel great -- until you wake up the next morning, barely able to move. Enter delayed onset muscle soreness, better known as DOMS. It's an acronym that athletes and fitness buffs wear with pride. As its name suggests, ""DOMS is muscle soreness that becomes evident six-to-eight hours following activity, peaking around 24 to 48 hours post-training,"" says Jon Mike, an exercise scientist at the University of New Mexico. While the symptoms will often start to diminish at about 72 hours, ""the precise time course and extent of DOMS is highly variable,"" Mike says. DOMS is most pronounced when you introduce a new training stimulus -- a new activity, increased intensity or volume -- or if you are new to physical activity in general. ""Your body is making adaptations to better prepare your muscles to do that activity again,"" says Lauren Haythe, certified Kinesis Myofascial Integration Practitioner and yoga teacher. That's why on Day 1 at the gym, after doing squats or lunges with 10-15 pound weights, you can be brutally sore the next day. ""But, as you continue on, you can build up from there, and you won't be so sore,"" she says. While all kinds of muscular contraction can cause soreness, eccentric contraction -- where the muscle lengthens as it contracts -- is most often associated with DOMS, according to Mike. This includes movements such as running downhill, lowering weights or lowering down into a squat or push-up position. ""There is also some evidence that upper body movement creates more soreness than lower body exercises,"" says Mike. Muscle discomfort is the most common characteristic of DOMS, but there are other symptoms. According to the American College of Sports Medicine, these may include reduced range of motion and joint stiffness, local swelling and tenderness, and diminished muscle strength. These symptoms appear gradually following exercise (not to be confused with acute pain that may arise during physical activity). No pain, no gain. Lactic acid build-up. An indicator of muscle growth. These are all phrases that we tend to associate with DOMS. While you may think you know everything you need to know about the condition that has you waddling like a duck, you may be surprised by what's actually happening in your body. Myth #1: DOMS is caused by the build-up of lactic acid. The verdict: Not true. During exercise, your body needs energy, and it breaks down molecules to get that. As a result of this metabolic process, your cells naturally become more acidic which makes your muscles feel like they're burning. But this isn't caused by lactate. Lactate is actually a by-product of the metabolic process and serves as a buffer and slows down the rate at which the cells become acidic. ""People produce lactate all the time, even at rest. It clears your system 30-minutes to one-hour after working out,"" says Mike. A study in Clinics in Sports Medicine found that DOMS is the result of microtrauma in the muscles and surrounding connective tissues, which causes inflammation. The reason that eccentric muscle contraction (think lowering a dumbbell back down in a biceps curl) is more likely to be the culprit is because it places a higher load on your muscles compared to concentric contraction. ""It's the active lengthening of muscle fibers under load. It's like you're pulling on a rope, and there's so much force that the rope starts to tear and pull apart,"" says Mike. Daily Burn: 5 exercise machines that aren't worth your time . Myth #2: It's not a good workout unless you get DOMS. We often wear our DOMS as a badge of honor and believe that if we're not sore, we're not doing enough during out workouts. But that's just not true. ""It doesn't mean that you're not getting as good of a workout because you're not crippled the next day,"" says Monica Vazquez, NASM certified personal trainer. ""You should feel [soreness] 24 hours to three days after the activity. If, after three days, you try to do the same exercise and you cannot because you go immediately to muscle failure, you've done too much."" According to Mike, studies have shown that soreness itself (using a scale from 0 to 10 to assess the level of soreness) is poorly correlated as an indicator of muscle adaptation and growth. There are many factors that influence how DOMS presents itself in individuals. ""There is great variability, even between people with similar genetics and even among highly-trained lifters [and athletes],"" he says. So while comparing notes (and commiserating) is all part of the process, soreness and DOMS isn't the best gauge of how effective your workout was or who's in better shape. Myth #3: The more fit you are, the less susceptible you are to DOMS. It's true that you will start to feel less sore as your body adapts to your workouts and learns to distribute the workload across your muscle fibers more effectively. That's why you should regularly change up your exercise routine. However, there is also a genetic component to how sensitive we are to pain and soreness. ""People can be no-responders, low-responders or high-responders to soreness,"" says Mike. If you're a high-responder, you will experience DOMS more acutely than someone who is a no- or low-responder when given the same training load. While you can't change your genes, it is important to know where you fall on the spectrum to understand how your body may respond to changes in your workouts. Daily Burn: How to do a pull-up (or add more reps) Myth #4: Muscle damage is a bad thing. Yes, DOMS appears to be caused by trauma to your muscle fibers, but it's not a definitive measure of muscle damage. In fact, a certain degree of soreness seems to be necessary. ""When muscles repair themselves, they get larger and stronger than before so that [muscle soreness] doesn't happen again,"" says Vazquez. While these mechanisms are not completely understood, Mike notes that some muscle trauma is needed to stimulate protein production and muscle growth. Myth #5: Pre- and post-workout stretching is a good way to prevent and treat DOMS. Unfortunately, no. A review of studies for the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on the effects of stretching before or after exercise on the development of delayed-onset muscle soreness found that pre- and post-workout stretching did not reduce the effects of DOMS in healthy adults. In fact, research has found that static stretching prior to working out does not safeguard you against injury and may actually decrease your power and strength. While you may not be able to avoid soreness altogether, ACSM suggests advancing slowly with a new workout, giving your muscles time to adapt and recover. Vazquez recommends always including a proper warm-up (including dynamic stretching), and cool-down period as part of your routine. Stop waddling: How to recover from DOMS . There are a number of ways to alleviate those can't-make-it-up-the-stairs symptoms. A sports massage is one good way to reduce the effects. ""A massage will move the fluid and blood around in your body which can help heal the microtrauma in your muscles better,"" says Haythe. A study in the Journal of Exercise Rehabilitation found massage to be beneficial on both gait and feelings of post-workout soreness. Other common ways to treat DOMS include foam rolling, contrast showers (alternating between hot and cold water), Epsom salt baths, increased protein intake (to increase protein synthesis) and omega-3 supplementation (to reduce inflammation), and sleep. New research in the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine suggests that supplementing with saffron may also help to alleviate DOMS. Regardless of your preferred Rx, Haythe recommends looking at your diet to make sure your taking in nutrients to help your body heal. ""Find a diet that can really help you feel the best that you can feel,"" she says. Daily Burn: Are you foam rolling all wrong? When it's more than just DOMS . There may be times when you overdo it with your workout and feel bad. Really bad. But when should you be concerned? ""If your level of soreness does not go down significantly after 72 hours and into the 96 hours mark,"" says Mike. ACSM advises that if the pain becomes debilitating, you experience heavy swelling in your limbs or your urine becomes dark in color, you should see your doctor. If it's an injury, you're more likely to feel it immediately during your workout -- something that should never be ignored. Soreness, on the other hand, will appear gradually, often the next day. ""An injury will likely limit your range of motion and last longer than three days,"" says Haythe. When all is said and done, DOMS shouldn't be avoided or revered. But it shouldn't be your only gauge of your level of fitness or strength. ""People think that the only part of their workout that matters is the hard part,"" Vazquez says. ""But, you can do more of the hard part if you don't injure yourself."" Long-term, Haythe says, ""You'll build more muscle, strength and endurance if you give your muscles a chance to take a deep breath and recover.""","""DOMS"" is an acronym for delayed onset muscle soreness .
DOMS happens when you introduce a new activity or increase the intensity, volume .
Symptoms can also include reduced range of motion and joint stiffness ."
"You can roll it, ferment it, dry it and put holes in it. It can be stinky enough to be banned on public transport, crawling with maggots or hard enough to break your teeth. Cheese is savored all around the world -- even if some of it is an acquired taste. Casu Marzu (Italy) Like caviar, Casu Marzu is enjoyed only by a select population. That's because it's served with live maggots. It does have a fan base in Sardinia, where sheep farmers for centuries have made pecorino cheese and left it to rot and attract flies. When the flies' eggs hatch the transformation takes place and the cheese becomes Casu Marzu. It's then consumed with relish or perhaps trepidation -- it has an aftertaste that lasts for hours. Gordon Ramsay called it ""the most dangerous cheese in the world."" Where to try it: Casu Marzu contains live insects so it can't be imported. Sardinia is therefore still the best option at associations such as Agugliastra in Lanusei, Sardinia; www.agugliastra.it. Milbenkase (Germany) Just when you thought the Italians took the proverbial cheese for their maggots, along come the Germans with their mite excrement variety. Produced in Wurchwitz from quark, it sits among dust mites for several months, with some rye for them to nibble on. The mites excrete an enzyme to ripen the cheese that turns it progressively yellow, red-brown and then black, at which point it's eaten, mites and all. Bitter and zesty, the cheese is said to have curative effects for allergies to house dust. If you'd like some cheese with your mites, there's a mite-shaped memorial in Würchwitz -- in the hollow base there's some Milbenkase left for passersby to try. Where to try it: Locally in Wurchwitz, Germany. Yak cheese (Tibetan communities) Imagine sucking and gnawing a piece of cheese-flavored resin for several hours and you'll get an idea of how hard this cheese is -- it could in fact break your teeth, although there are softer varieties. The cheese is made by wrapping the curd from yak's milk in cloth and pressing it to get rid of the water. When it dries out it's cut into pieces and allowed to dry, often over a wood fire. It's earthy and tasty. The yak is the male of the species and doesn't produce milk, so it really should be called nak cheese after the female. Where to try it: Markets in Tibetan areas of China, India, Nepal and Bhutan. Airag cheese (Central Asia) Airag cheese, or horse milk cheese, is common in Central Asia where the horse is still integral to life in many places. To make airag, a mare is milked during foaling season and the milk left to ferment with an agent such as last season's airag. It's either suspended next to the ger/yurt entrance so anyone passing can stir it or it's tied to a saddle to achieve the same effect over a day's riding. The airag is then added to boiled milk to curdle it, filtered through a fabric bag and pressed. It can be eaten fresh or dried. The dry variety is a popular snack out on the steppe, softened by soaking it in tea or soup. Where to try it: Out on the Central Asian steppe in the ger/yurt of a nomadic family. Camel's milk cheese (Ethiopia, Mauritania, Sudan and Bedouin communities) Nomadic herders across Africa have been milking their camels for centuries. Not only are the resilient beasts a more viable alternative to cows in dry climates, but their rich, earthy milk has more fat and protein. However, making cheese from camel milk is a more difficult process, so herders use camel rennet from pieces of the animal's stomach to coagulate the milk and create curds. This may account for its sour taste and pungent aroma. To enjoy camelbert options you'll have to visit supermarket shelves in Nouakchott, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. It's also found in Kazakhstan. Where to try it: Supermarket shelves in Nouakchott, the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia; Costa Coffee in the UK; Starbucks in Dubai. Human milk cheese (New York) When the freezer of New York chef Daniel Angerer started to overflow with his wife's breast milk, he decided to experiment with it rather than throw it out. He blogged about the process online with photos of mother's milk with beets and romaine, dehydrated porcini mushroom and onion chutney. For those feeling queasy, rest assured the cheese was never produced in his restaurant or sold. As for commercial opportunities, lactating mothers can't produce anything like the quantity of breast milk needed to make large quantities of cheese. Where to try it: Not yet commercially available. American cheese . In a country that celebrates National Grilled Cheese Day, it should come as no surprise that American cheese remains a staple on grocery shelves -- the texture and meltability are perfect for toasted sandwiches and burgers. Technically, of course, American cheese isn't even real cheese -- ingredients include milk, whey, milkfat, salt, gelatine, milk powder, dyed orange, artificial flavors and oil. The odd concoction is blended with a generic processed cheese to form the smooth, creamy and super-melty slices that are either loved, tolerated or abhorred around the United States. Where to try it: McDonald's, American food supermarkets. Lichen cheese (Canada) When a small Quebec company found out the Inuit once ate a fermented lichen from the stomach of caribou that tasted like blue cheese, they decided to try it for themselves. Using Quebec goat's milk and lichen, the company creates a mold from roasting and boiling the lichen, then lets it rest and ferment. The cheese is still in its experimental stage. Where to try it: Société d'Orignal, Montreal, Canada. Deer milk cheese (New Zealand) Reindeer milk cheese has been produced among the Sami communities in Finland for years. Now, cheese from the humble red deer may soon become a hallmark of New Zealand. The combined work of scientists and a cheese maker have resulted in the first cheese from the Kiwi bambi. At $100 per liter, the rich deer milk isn't cheap, but with half of the world's farmed red deer production in New Zealand, farmers are getting excited about the possibility of having a product to sell beyond venison. Where to try it: Buy it from Whitestone cheese company, North Otago, New Zealand. Alpaca and llama cheese (Andean communities) Life on the harsh Altiplano would be a struggle without the alpacas and llamas that give their dung for fuel, hide for leather, wool for clothing and milk for cheese. Comical though they may appear -- they even give the occasional spit and unusual noise -- they're a little tricky to milk. Once extracted, though, their whole milk can be made into a long-lasting cheese that's salty, rich and heavy in texture. This finds its way into markets and local food like empanadas, though most travelers come across it only when visiting locals. Where to try it: Local markets, Andes region, South America. Donkey cheese (Serbia) At the Zasavica Special Nature Reserve, 50 kilometers out of Belgrade, you can get your hands on pule, or donkey cheese. While healthy -- it has 60 times more vitamin C than cow's milk -- donkeys only produce 200 ml of milk a day. About 25 liters are required to make just one kilogram of cheese. That means the white, crumbly pule is both limited and costly. Currently it goes for about €1,000 a kilo, or $576 a pound. The reserve also makes soap, a liquor and facial cream from the milk. Cleopatra claimed her beauty was due to bathing in donkey milk. Where to try it: In the Zasavica Special Nature Reserve, or buy it online at www.zasavica.org.rs.","Strange cheeses include those made with maggots, dust mites and even human breast milk .
American cheese, such as that found in fast food burgers, isn't really a cheese at all .
A Serbian group makes cheese from donkey milk ."
