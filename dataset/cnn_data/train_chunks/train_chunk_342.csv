"(CNN) -- After a student made obscene comments about her on Twitter, a high school teacher in northern Mexico taught a lesson with an online post of her own: a video showing her confronting the girl in class. Now the teacher is on administrative leave. The student has been suspended. The video has gone viral, with hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. And there are now copies floating around. The eight-minute video gives a glimpse of a lesson that students at the science and technology high school in Mexico's Tamaulipas state aren't likely to forget. At first, it looks like a typical classroom scene, with students attentively listening as human resources teacher Idalia Hernandez Ramos presents the day's lesson. For several minutes, Hernandez asks one student to stand up read a statement about social media out loud, then peppers her with questions about how harmful it can be and how people can be prosecuted for what they've posted. The student mentions possible problems with cyberbullying. ""And the destruction of the image of another person?"" Hernandez asks. The student nods vigorously. That's when Hernandez confronts her. ""Knowing that, could you tell me why you wrote this?"" she says, handing the student a phone. A long, tense silence follows. The student then admits being the author of the tweet, saying that she was ""upset."" Growing visibly emotional, Hernandez tells the student that she's also ""very upset."" She then points to several other students recording the incident on cell phone cameras and tablets and demands an apology. ""My family saw it (the tweet) and now you're going to apologize in front of these cameras,"" Hernandez says. ""I made a mistake,"" the student says in a barely audible voice. ""The teacher didn't deserve being called those things."" A fellow student who apparently shared the comments is also chastised by the teacher, who calls them both ""cowards"" in front of the whole classroom. Hernandez then repeated the words used against her -- b*tch and whore -- in front of the shocked group of students. ""Listen to me well: I will not allow anyone to call me that, especially a young brat like you and you,"" Hernandez says. An official at the CBTis 103 science and technology high school told CNN that Hernandez has been temporarily taken out of the classroom while the August incident is investigated. The 17-year-old student was suspended for two weeks but is back in school, the official said. CNN is not disclosing the student's name because she's a minor. Debate has surged on social media over the video, with some praising the teacher and others criticizing her for humiliating the student. The school official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that ""most of the teacher's colleagues are siding with her."" The official also said federal education authorities in Mexico City are reviewing the case. ""It may take up to four months to make a final determination on whether the teacher is fired or not,"" she said.","A teacher confronts a student who posted obscene insults on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- Abdul Aziz believes he was standing right next to a shooter Sunday when gunmen opened fire at a Mother's Day parade in New Orleans, injuring 19 people. ""Everyone around me, except me, was shot,"" he said. ""I was pretty fortunate to get away."" Aziz, 33, a photojournalist, was at the second-line parade when gunfire broke out at the corner of Frenchman Street and North Villere Street. Second-line parades, which involve dancing and brass bands, are a New Orleans tradition. They happen most every Sunday, except during the hottest months in summer, according to Aziz. ""We turned off of a main thoroughfare to a smaller residential street, and that's when the shots rang out. I was standing, I believe, right next to the shooter. I saw muzzle flash, but unfortunately I didn't get a chance to see who the shooter was,"" he said. People panicked and ran. Aziz, who has worked in the Middle East, started taking pictures. He sent those images to CNN iReport. ""It's a little jarring when you see these types of things on the home front,"" he said. ""I'm sad. I love this city. We're plagued by crime, and it's just not getting better no matter what we do."" According to police, 19 people were injured in the shooting, including two children. Ten men and seven women were among the victims. The children suffered graze wounds. Other injuries ranged from minor to severe. Shots were fired from different guns, and officers saw three suspects running from the scene, police said. One of the suspects was described as an African-American male, approximately 18 to 22 years old, wearing a white T-shirt and blue jean shorts. No one is in custody. ""This is an extremely unusual occurrence, and we're confident that we will make swift arrests,"" said Remi Braden, a police spokeswoman. Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas told CNN affiliate WVUE that it appears ""two or three people just, for a reason unknown to us, started shooting at, towards, or in the crowd."" He asked anyone with information to call authorities. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu echoed that request, challenging the community to get involved. ""It's important for us, as I have said, to change the culture of death on the streets of New Orleans to a culture of life, and it's going to take an all-hands-on-deck approach,"" he said. ""These kinds of incidents are not going to go unanswered. We're going to be very, very aggressive. There were hundreds of people out there today, so somebody knows who did this."" CNN's Jennifer Moore, Janet DiGiacomo and Jareen Imam contributed to this report.","""These kinds of incidents are not going to go unanswered,"" the mayor says .

"(CNN) -- You can't change Washington from the inside. President Obama was criticized for stating that simple truth during the campaign, but without Americans organizing in support of the issues they believe in, lobbyists and special interests will drive the agenda in Washington. At this crossroads for our economy, we can't afford business as usual. That's why we've formed Organizing for Action, to ensure that the voices of the majority of Americans who voted for policies that will strengthen the middle class will be heard. 'Obama for America' morphs into 'Organizing for Action' As we worked for change during the president's first term, we saw special interests spend unprecedented amounts in an attempt to persuade Congress to vote against policies the American people voted for. History is repeating itself. Gun manufacturers are well represented. The NRA is running advertisements to defeat common sense gun safety measures like universal background checks, which more than 90% of Americans support. Groups with unnamed backers are advocating against comprehensive immigration reform. We have no plans to shrug this off and tell those Americans organizing their communities to stand down. While the president delivered the State of the Union address, volunteers at more than 1,200 events were asking their friends and neighbors to join them in ensuring that agenda is enacted. Since Organizing for Action was established six weeks ago, volunteers have held more than 100 events in more than 80 congressional districts demanding a yes vote on the president's plan to curb gun violence. Whether it's participating in a social media campaign or hosting a press conference, 964,000 Americans have already mobilized through Organizing for Action -- and we've ensured they have the tools they need to get the attention they deserve. Push-back from some quarters has been fierce. Members of Congress who are used to just worrying about a few interest groups will face broader based opposition because of organizing efforts by Organizing for Action volunteers around the country. Those who previously had special access will no longer be unchallenged. There has been some confusion about what Organizing for Action is and is not. Organizing for Action is an issue advocacy group, not an electoral one. We'll mobilize to support the president's agenda, but we won't do so on behalf of political candidates. The president has always believed that special interests have undue influence over the policymaking process, and the mission of this organization is to rebalance the power structure. Obama supporters launch ad campaign to push gun proposals . While Organizing for Action is a nonprofit social welfare organization that faces a lower disclosure threshold than a political campaign, we believe in being open and transparent. That's why every donor who gives $250 or more to this organization will be disclosed on the website with the exact amount they give on a quarterly basis. We have now decided not to accept contributions from corporations, federal lobbyists or foreign donors. Supporters of Organizing for Action will dedicate their time to mobilize their friends and neighbors on behalf of the president's agenda. Whether you're a volunteer or a donor, we can't and we won't guarantee access to any government officials. But just as the president and administration officials deliver updates on the legislative process to Americans and organizations across the ideological spectrum, there may be occasions when members of Organizing for Action are included in those updates. These are not opportunities to lobby -- they are briefings on the positions the president has taken and the status of seeing them through. Special interests shouldn't have a stranglehold on the policymaking process. Too many Americans worked too hard over the past six years to ensure that the middle class gets a fair shot to stop now. For every lobbying group that puts a dollar on the air tearing down the president's agenda, an Organizing for Action volunteer will mobilize to counter it. Instead of coming from the highest paid lobbyists on K Street, change will come from Americans organizing across the nation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jim Messina .","Jim Messina: Post-election, a new organization aims to advance Obama's agenda .
He says goal is to counter well-funded special interests that don't represent majority views .

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- A 2-year-old girl in Mali has been diagnosed with Ebola, making her the West African country's first confirmed case, health officials said Thursday. The girl was brought to Mali from neighboring Guinea, where the outbreak this year is believed to have started, World Health Organization spokeswoman Yvette Bivigou said. The girl, whose father died of Ebola, was taken to the hospital in Kayes after a nurse noticed she was suffering from what appeared to be Ebola-like symptoms. A test confirmed the girl has Ebola, Health Ministry spokeswoman Markatie Daou said. ""The girl is still in the hospital in Kayes together with members of her family who might have been exposed to the virus,"" she said. The confirmed case in Mali makes it the sixth West African country to be hit by the virus, which the WHO reported has killed more than 4,800 people. Ousmane Kone, Mali's minister for public health, called for people in Kayes, west of the capital city of Bamako, to ""stay calm"" and observe ""hygiene measures."" ""We identified the first contacts of the patient,"" he said. Even so, he asked anyone who had contact with the girl to contact authorities. The news comes just days after the WHO announced that vaccine trials are expected to begin in January in West Africa. The initial vaccine tests are being given to volunteers in countries such as Mali, the United States and England. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","A 2-year-old girl brought from Guinea to Mali has been diagnosed with Ebola .

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's political troubles may reshape the Republican race much more radically than most commentators are yet predicting. To understand why, think of the Republican presidential nomination as a playoff game between two rival leagues. One league is composed of the Republican party's donors and professionals. The other features the party's activists and militants. In 2012, Mitt Romney triumphed early and totally in League A, and then waited patiently for the nomination as League B stumbled its way through a garish series of impossible candidates. The only plausible player fielded by League B, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, whiffled out before he had properly started the game. This time, though, League B has attracted plausible talent. Whatever any detractor may say about Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, they are U.S. senators. They may be unelectable to the presidency, but they are not inherently unnominatable, in the way that Donald Trump and Herman Cain were unnominatable. A better League B puts new pressure on League A -- at exactly the same time when League A seems be sputtering in the way League B sputtered four years ago. League A's brightest prospect, Christie, looks likely to soon be benched by self-inflicted injuries. There is other talent in League A, of course. If interested, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush could sweep League A -- but almost one-third of the way through the political cycle, he has yet to indicate that he is interested. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has fans in League A, as do Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan. This abundance of choice suggests that in 2016, unlike 2012, the League A contest will extend for a long time. The League A contenders will have months to run negative ads against each other -- and to remind League B fans why they dislike each League A player: Rubio, for wishing to widen immigration; Ryan, for writing a budget that cut Medicare and Medicaid; Bush, for his last name. The prospect of a long and bitter battle within League A -- conjoined to improvements in the seriousness and professionalism of League B -- calls into question many of the usual rules of Republican politics. Old Rule: The winner of the Republican nomination this time is the guy who came second last time. That rule held in every open contest from Ronald Reagan (runner-up in 1976) to Mitt Romney (runner-up in 2008). Not this time: In 2016, for the first time since the 1960s, there is no Republican heir apparent. Old Rule: The Big Money always wins. From the rejection of Hillary Clinton in 2008 all the way back to the defeat of Edmund Muskie in 1972, Democrats have often preferred insurgents over leadership favorites. Not so Republicans. 2012 spectacularly confirmed the power of the Republican Establishment. But in 2016, the rule is looking wobbly for the first time since 1964. Old Rule: Electability matters most in Republican presidential primaries. Tea party voters took chances in 2010 and 2012 on many oddball candidates for House and Senate. They played it safe at the presidential level. But many will feel that the defeat of McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012 discredit the case for the ""responsible choice."" In 2016, Republican primary voters will for the first time since Barry Goldwater be offered a brace of seemingly plausible, irresponsible choices. If League A looks as disorganized in 18 months as it does today, will the GOP's primary voters continue to refuse temptation? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Chris Christie, the leader among moderates, may not be a 2016 GOP contender .
Lack of a clear favorite may open way for GOP activists to pick the nominee, he says .
Candidates such as Ted Cruz and Rand Paul look more plausible, Frum says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Democrats on Capitol Hill are reeling after the midterm elections left them in the minority in both the House and Senate. But don't expect new faces to lead the party after the brutal election. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, and Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, are both expected to keep their leadership positions next year despite the election's punishing losses. They're both hanging on with the same expectation: 2016 will be a better year for Democrats that could return them to the majority. Pelosi, a California Democrat who was the first female House speaker, is already officially in the leadership race. In a letter to her colleagues on Wednesday, Pelosi said Election Night was ""difficult"" for Democrats but said there was more work for the party to do. Meanwhile, people close to Reid say he hopes to remain the Senate Democratic leader for many years and is readying a run for a 2016 re-election bid in Nevada to make sure that happens. ""He has no desire to be a lobbyist or put his feet up and watch TV, said Jon Ralston, a Nevada political journalist who tracks Reid closely. ""He will not want to go out a loser and the 2016 map is much more favorable."" ""Based on everything I know and based on what he's doing to get ready, I believe he's going to run in 2016,"" said Jim Manley, his former spokesman. ""He's a guy who can't keep still and is a legislator at heart. I could see him continuing for a long time."" Reid has led the Senate Democrats since 2005 and Democrats have been in the majority eight of those years. Some Democrats privately grumble Reid could do more to work with Republicans to compromise on tough issues. But he remains popular with senators in his caucus, many of whom he helped get elected, and they are loyal to him for that. Now as minority leader, Reid will have to be the face of the opposition. He and Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is in line to become majority leader, have a notoriously sour relationship and that's unlikely to change now that their positions are reversed. WATCH: Rand Paul on the midterms . But Manley said Reid might be willing to work with McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, who leads the House Republicans, if they don't try to pass ""extreme measures."" ""It's going to be very difficult for Sen. McConnell to find the compromise necessary that brings along Democratic votes,"" Manley said. ""At the end of the day, the President still has the veto pen, so if they want to get things done, they are going to have to deal."" Even before the election, Pelosi signaled that she was more focused on 2016 than 2014. Downplaying the midterms, Pelosi said her party would do ""OK,"" but then immediately began taunting Republicans about 2016. ""Their days are numbered. I know that in two years, there will be a Democratic Congress and a Democratic president the House,"" Pelosi said. But now that House Republicans have expanded their ranks to the largest GOP majority since the 1920's, Pelosi told her colleagues in her Wednesday letter that her party has to do a better job of boosting turnout. She said she planned to focus on a new project starting next week when Congress returns to increase voter participation. The challenge for 2016 definitely got more formidable for Pelosi, but few expect the 74 year old Pelosi to slow down. She has been a relentless fundraiser ever since she joined House leadership, and the war chest she amassed for her Democratic colleagues helps her future job security. In the 2014 election cycle, she raised more than $100 million for House Democrats, and personally was responsible for raising over one-third of $172 million that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised for the midterms. In the last two years, Pelosi traveled to 115 cities and attended or participated in 750 fundraising or campaign-related events. Pelosi often points to one accomplishment in particular: House Democrats for the first time in 2012 became a caucus made up of more female and minority members than white men --a so called majority-minority caucus. But the Democratic caucus that Pelosi joined in 1987 has changed dramatically and some of her closest allies in Congress retired this year. When fellow veteran California lawmakers George Miller and Henry Waxman announced they wouldn't run for re-election, there was some speculation that Pelosi may decide to step down. Many of the members elected in the last two cycles are younger, and they respect Pelosi's political skills, but privately some of them say they would like to see some fresh faces at the leadership table. Pelosi's number two, Rep Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, and her number three, Rep Jim Clyburn, D-South Carolina --also in their seventies -- are expected to remain in their positions. Pelosi will get to add a new voice to her leadership group when she picks the next chair of the DCCC. The current chair, Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, said he doesn't want another turn at the job, and at least three mentioned for the post are younger than those already in leadership -- Rep. Jim Himes, D-Connecticut, and Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colorado, and Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Maryland. With the loss of the few remaining moderate Democrats in the House, the caucus will skew more liberal. Pelosi publicly says she has a good relationship with House Speaker John Boehner, but there are few issues where the two are likely to come together to produce bipartisan legislation. Pelosi hinted at her focus going into the next political cycle at a fundraiser featuring former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in late October. ""I am frequently introduced as the highest-ranking woman in political office in our country,"" Pelosi said. ""I'd like to give up that title and elect a Democratic woman for President of the United States."" CORRECTION: An initial version of this story misquoted Jim Manley.","Democrats will be in the minority in the House and Senate .
Reid, Pelosi will continue in leadership roles ."
"(CNN) -- Now that Republicans have won control of the Senate, Washington is awash with rumors and speculation about how President Barack Obama and the GOP Congress will get along. Armchair Dr. Phils are already yakking about how the two sides should just get along ""for the sake of the children...er, country."" But this is not a troubled marriage. It's more complicated than even that. Rather than look to the psychobabble of self-help, we should look at the hard-earned successes of difficult peace negotiations between nations. President Obama, House Speaker John Boehner and presumptive Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should begin with what peace negotiators call ""Confidence Building Measures."" CBM's between nation begin with cultural exchanges -- like sending American ping-pong players to China. This is why a bourbon summit would be useful, and I hope Sen. McConnell takes the President up on his offer. But once you've broken the ice by breaking out the bourbon, where do you go? What issues do you start negotiating? The easier ones. It is a troubling sign that, in their post-election press conferences, both Obama and McConnell kept circling back to immigration. At one level this is obvious: Immigration is an important national priority on which the two parties seem deeply divided. That's why they should not start with immigration. Instead they should start small. One place where Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton found they could agree, when they were at this juncture in the mid-1990s was biomedical research. Each wanted to build on America's lead in the field, and so they passed legislation to double funding for the National Institutes of Health over five years. (The five years extended into the George W. Bush presidency, and to his credit he honored the deal.) The NIH has been in the news recently, since its director, Dr. Francis Collins, said we would already have an Ebola vaccine but for budget cuts. It is simply true that, after the Clinton-Gingrich-Bush increase, NIH funding has flat-lined. In fact, NIH has lost 25% of its purchasing power, due to budget constraints and the moronic policy sequester. Boosting NIH would be good for the economy. A $3 billion investment championed by Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush paid for the research that decoded the human genome. That $3 billion investment has spurred -- get this -- $965 billion in economic activity, including 53,000 new jobs and $290 billion in personal income, according to a study by the Battelle Technology Partnership Practice for United for Medical Research, a coalition of research institutions, patient and health advocates and private industry. Boosting NIH is also good politics. I am on the Board of Visitors of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. MD Anderson is the number-one recipient of research grants from the National Cancer Institute, which is part of NIH. And you know which senators have MD Anderson in their state? You got it: Ted Cruz and John Cornyn. One a tea party favorite and one a Chamber of Commerce hero. If they would get on board with boosting NIH funding, a whole lot of their constituents on both sides of the aisle would be happy. Championing biomedical research did not dent Newt Gingrich's conservative credentials, nor did it hurt Bill Clinton among liberals. Because cancer knows no partisan boundaries. One in two American men will develop cancer. One in two. And one in three American women will. If you're reading this at the office (I promise not to tell) look around: Half the guys and a third of the women will, one day, sit in an office and hear a doc say, ""You have cancer."" Think about that as you have dinner with your family, when you're at a football game this weekend or in church this Sunday. President Obama lost his mother and grandmother to cancer.  Mitch McConnell beat polio. Each of them know the pain of loss and the promise of biomedical research. So my advice to them is to start with the basics: basic science, and then work their way up to the more intractable problems.","Paul Begala: Bourbon summit for Obama, McConnell a good idea. Here's what to talk about: .
Medical research funding was common ground for Gingrich, Clinton at similar political juncture .
Begala says they pushed doubling NIH funding in 5 years; it benefited nation, economy .
Begala: No NIH funding stalled. Boosting it is good politics, a good place for the two to start ."
"(CNN) -- As President Barack Obama and former Gov. Mitt Romney crisscrossed the country during the final week of the 2012 presidential campaign, few people were able to see the candidates in their most candid and unguarded moments, except for their personal photographers. Several weeks ago, CNN invited each campaign team to submit images from the last week of the race, from Friday, Oct. 26 through Saturday, Nov. 3. Little did anyone know that the last week would be dominated not by last-minute stops in swing states or wall-to-wall speeches to rally the party faithful, but rather one story: Superstorm Sandy. Here are images, many provided exclusively to CNN by the Obama campaign and The White House, displayed in chronological order and shot by photographer Pete Souza.

"(CNN) -- Standing just over 2 feet tall, Jyoti Amge of Nagpur, India, was confirmed Friday as the world's shortest living woman. Guinness World Records, known as the global authority on record-breaking -- albeit odd -- achievements, flew to India on Amge's 18th birthday to take final measurements and confirm the new record. The title previously belonged to Bridgette Jordan, 22, of the United States, who measures 2 feet, 3 inches tall. Amge's birthday was celebrated at a party in Nagpur with cake and guests from her hometown as well as Guinness representatives from London. Amge, wearing a purple sari and celebratory henna, stood proudly next to a copy of the 2012 Guinness record book and her official certificate, which was almost as big as Amge herself. Amge, at 2 feet, 0.06 inches tall, is the same height as an average 2-year-old as a result of being born with a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia. But Amge is every bit an 18-year-old woman, attending a regular high school and dreaming of becoming a Bollywood star. She will star in two Bollywood movies next year, according to Guinness. ""It is wonderful to celebrate my 18th birthday with a new world record. It's like an added birthday present,"" Guinness quoted Amge as saying. ""I feel grateful to be this size, after all, if I weren't small and had not achieved these world records, I might never have been able to visit Japan and Europe and many other wonderful countries.""

"(CNN) -- Four people died after a small plane crashed into a building near Wichita's Mid-Continent Airport in southern Kansas on Thursday morning, city Fire Marshal Brad Crisp said. While five people were initially transported to the hospital, three of those patients were reportedly treated and released. ""Firefighters engaged in a horrific fight for several minutes. We have the fire under control. We are in the process of trying to determine if all the employees and visitors who may have been in the building are accounted for,"" Fire Chief Ron Blackwell told CNN affiliate KSNW. About 50 to 60 firefighters responded and were evacuated after the structure was deemed unstable, Wichita police said. Two of those killed were inside the building when the plane crashed, police said. The pilot was killed, CNN affiliates reported. One of the injured was in serious condition and another in fair condition, an official with Via Christi Health, a local hospital, told KSNW. The other three, who were in good condition earlier in the day, were released, the station reported. FAA and National Transportation Safety Board investigators are on the scene. ""There is a small aircraft that went into the FlightSafety building"" near Mid-Continent Airport, said Steve Phillips, a FlightSafety International spokesman. The plane was a Hawker Beechcraft B200 Super King Air, Phillips said. It was en route to Mena, Arkansas, CNN affiliate KWCH reported. The FAA said the twin-engine plane lost an engine on takeoff and crashed into a two-story building, KSNW reported. The roof on the building's eastern side has collapsed, the station reported. No information has yet been released on the identities of those in the plane or in the building. According to one aviation website, the aircraft can carry as many as 13 passengers. It ""crashed into the roof of our training center. I have no information on how many on board,"" Phillips said. ""We have the manager of the training center on site, and he's making sure everyone is OK, but I don't have an answer for that."" The building is across the street from the airport, he said. There were about 100 people inside the building at the time, Blackwell told KWCH. Video from KSNW showed thick smoke rising from the building at 10:20 a.m. (11:20 a.m. ET). Flights were operating normally, though some roads around the airport were blocked off, the airport said in a tweet.

"(CNN) -- Motivation is a tricky thing. We need it in every aspect of our lives: to get up in the morning and go to work, to start (and finish) that 10-page paper, to do laundry after a long day. Yet the motivation to get healthy often eludes us. It hides in the form of excuses -- excuses for why we can't go to the gym or cook a healthy meal, why we can't get enough sleep or make time for ourselves. Often we lack motivation because we lack inspiration. Why I became a triathlete . Every year CNN selects iReporters to race in a triathlon with Dr. Sanjay Gupta and the Fit Nation team. This year we're giving six lucky readers a road bike (with all the necessary accessories), a wet suit and a gym membership to help them prepare for the Nautica Malibu Triathlon on September 14. As they train for their first triathlon with support from our fitness and nutrition coaches, they'll blog, tweet and share their workouts online. You'll watch as they get ready to swim a half-mile in the ocean, bike 18 miles and run 4 miles along the Pacific coast. We hope this year's Fit Nation Triathlon Challenge team will inspire you to make your own health a priority. Whether it's being a role model for your children, accomplishing a personal goal or simply being able to enjoy life, find your motivation for getting fit and eating better. If our past Fit Nation team members are any indication, you'll be happy you did. Meet this year's team: . Ron Cothran . Ron is a respiratory therapist in Pueblo, Colorado. He found out about the Fit Nation challenge after reading an article about one of last year's triathletes, Rae Timme, in the Pueblo newspaper. Ron is turning 50 this year, and is determined to live the second half of his life better than the first half. Ron recently underwent a gastric bypass, and has already lost a great deal of weight. But he's here to tell you, surgery is most certainly not the easy way out. He says this challenge will help him take things to the next level. Learn more about Ron's story on iReport . Sia Figiel .

But when she developed type 2 diabetes and eventually lost all her teeth because of it, she decided enough was enough! She saw Annette Miller's progress on last year's Fit Nation team and decided to start walking and eating healthier. On her own, she lost 100 pounds, and now she's joining us to lose the rest.

"(CNN) -- Outgoing BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward declared Tuesday that the Gulf of Mexico oil well disaster represents a failure for the entire deepwater oil and gas drilling industry, not just for BP alone. ""The industry needs to re-evaluate safety,"" Hayward told investment professionals in a webcast. His comments came after the BP board decided to replace him October 1 with Robert Dudley, the head of the company's Gulf cleanup effort. ""Everyone will re-evaluate the business model to reduce risk associated with deepwater drilling,"" Hayward added. BP maintains that it alone does not deserve all the blame for the April 20 accident and its aftermath, and it intends to pursue legal action to have drilling partners share in the cost of containment and cleanup. Those partners include Transocean, which operated the rig; Cameron, which built the blowout preventer that failed to shut down the well; and Halliburton, which cemented the oil drill into place underwater. ""It is clear the accident was the result of multiple equipment errors and human error involving many companies,"" Hayward said in the webcast. The project's contracts include arbitration clauses and BP said it will first approach the issue through that legal avenue. Hayward also defended his record on safety. ""Safety, people and performance have been my watchwords,"" he said. ""We've made significant progress."" The BP CEO, who became the corporate face of the Deepwater disaster had, during his three years at the helm of the British-based oil giant, often spoken of BP's improved safety record since the 2006 Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, oil spill and the 2005 Texas City, Texas, refinery fire that killed 15 people, which occurred before he took over the company in 2007. ""From the beginning of the crisis, I've sought to do the right thing, do it the right way and communicate openly,"" said Hayward. ""I believe BP has shown what corporate responsibility really means and I believe that applies to individuals as well as companies,"" he said. Eleven workers died when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico. From that time until July 15 -- when a cap was sealed over the ruptured well head -- oil spewed into the Gulf at the rate of tens of thousands of barrels a day.","BP CEO Tony Hayward: ""Many companies"" in energy industry responsible for Gulf oil disaster .

"(CNN) -- Attention cruise passengers: You now have more protection when things go awry. On Wednesday, Cruise Lines International Association announced the adoption of a new passenger bill of rights. ""The Cruise Industry Passenger Bill of Rights codifies many longstanding practices of CLIA members and goes beyond those to further inform cruise guests of the industry's commitment to their comfort and care,"" said Christine Duffy, president and CEO of CLIA, in a statement. The new policy comes on the heels of a series of high-profile setbacks for the industry. From mechanical failures to a deadly accident off the coast of Italy, incidents in the past year-and-a-half have battered the industry's reputation for safety. Among passengers' rights are an emergency power source in case of a main generator failure and a ship crew ""properly trained"" in emergency procedures. Generator failure played a key role in the days-long stranding of the Carnival Triumph in February after an engine fire knocked out power. In the case of the January 2012 Costa Concordia disaster off the coast of Italy, which killed 32, many passengers recounted a chaotic evacuation of the sinking ship. Another provision of the cruise industry rule mirrors the Department of Transportation's tarmac delay rule for airline passengers in giving cruise passengers the right to disembark a docked ship if adequate food, water and restroom facilities are not available onboard. The organization's new policy also provides the right to emergency medical attention, timely information related to itinerary changes and mechanical problems and full or partial refunds for voyages that are canceled or ended early due to mechanical failures. The bill also assumes responsibility for passenger transportation and lodging in cases when mechanical issues cut voyages short. The full bill of rights will be published on each cruise line's website, in addition to a toll-free number for passengers to call with questions about shipboard operations. The bill of rights is effective immediately for passengers who purchase cruises in North America for any itinerary on CLIA's more than two dozen North American member cruise lines, which include Carnival, Costa, Disney, Holland America, Royal Caribbean and others. The industry organization is also planning to request global recognition of the new policy from the International Maritime Organization.","Cruise industry group announces passenger bill of rights .

"(CNN) -- The stubborn Rim Fire, one of the largest wildfire in California's history, is 70% contained, the U.S. Forest Service said Monday night. With rain and cooler temperatures in the forecast, firefighters who have toiled tirelessly for days will likely make further gains in the coming days. Still, officials don't expect full containment until September 20. The Rim Fire started August 17 and swallowed more than 235,000 acres -- making it the fifth-largest wildfire in California history. It has cost the state more than $39 million to date. Although the fire has consumed tens of thousands of acres inside Yosemite National Park, it has so far had little or no direct impact on Yosemite Valley, a popular spot for tourists and home to many of the park's iconic attractions, including the El Capitan rock formation. Authorities don't know what started the Rim Fire -- although the fire chief in the town of Twain Harte said illegal marijuana growers could be the unintentional culprits. ""It might be some sort of illicit grove, marijuana grow-type thing."" Todd McNeal told a meeting on August 23. The video of the meeting was posted on YouTube and picked up steam recently. Calls to the Twain Harte fire department were not answered Monday night. But Mark Healey with the Rim Fire Information Line dismissed the suggestion, calling it ""rumors.""

"(CNN) -- His GPS monitor has been cut off and George Zimmerman is free -- but only legally. Zimmerman fears for his life. He's a reviled figure to millions, despite his acquittal Saturday night in Trayvon Martin's killing. And he could still be held criminally liable for Martin's death. George Zimmerman found not guilty . 'They want revenge' Zimmerman's attorney describes him as a marked man. ""He has to be very cautious and protective of his safety because there is still a fringe element who have said ... that they will not listen to a verdict of not guilty,"" said Mark O'Mara. Zimmerman, 29, has kept his address under wraps for more than a year and worn a disguise whenever he left his four walls. He has often strapped on body armor, according to O'Mara. And he may feel the need to be armed. When asked by CNN's Piers Morgan whether Zimmerman will keep the gun used in the killing, his brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., said, ""I don't see any reason why he shouldn't. ""I think he has more reason now than ever to think that people are trying to kill him because they express they're trying to kill him, all the time, every day, on my Twitter feed, on the Internet."" Catch up on the trial, verdict . Robert Zimmerman gave more details Sunday on CNN's ""New Day."" ""The threats are vile, they're vicious, they're disgusting. And sometimes they're in person. People wearing shirts with my brother's face on it in crosshairs, encouraging others to act out violently against him. I know that you can't take every one one of those seriously, but you can't afford to be wrong either. Because you can be dead wrong if somebody really were intent on harming you."" ""He's going to have to learn to move about in a very low-profile way and keep to himself,"" Robert Zimmerman said, although having the GPS removed and no trial to occupy his days helps end George Zimmerman's feeling of being ""kind of caged in."" Zimmerman, married with no children, may leave Florida and choose to lead a life in the shadows -- like Casey Anthony, the Florida woman acquitted of killing her 2-year-old daughter in 2008. Anger, sadness but little surprise . Zimmerman could face more criminal charges . With the state criminal case over, George Zimmerman could now face new criminal charges. The federal government could file a civil rights suit, accusing him of violating 17-year-old Martin's civil rights. The NAACP has called on the Justice Department to file civil rights charges, and is asking the public to sign a petition. ""The most fundamental of civil rights -- the right to life -- was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,"" the group said. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, acknowledged killing the unarmed teen, saying it was in self-defense. The Justice Department did not respond directly to the NAACP demand. It has a separate federal investigation going on. An official told CNN the department ""continues to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation, as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial."" Meanwhile, the Martin family could file a civil lawsuit against Zimmerman, seeking damages. The suit would claim wrongful death -- which is easier to prove than murder or manslaughter. And the Rev. Al Sharpton said the acquittal was ""only the first round in the pursuit of justice."" NAACP President Ben Jealous expects legal action will proceed on both fronts. ""There will be a civil phase almost assuredly, and then there will be a federal civil rights phase,"" he told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""And we are putting our faith in that system."" Robert Zimmerman rejected Jealous' call for charges against his brother. Authorities have interviewed ""about three dozen of his closest friends and acquaintances. And there is not any inkling of racism,""he said. ""In fact, there's evidence to show the opposite. I would encourage them to cool their jets, give everyone some time to kind of process what's going on. ""Agitation doesn't help us. It doesn't do anybody any good right now."" Sports stars sound off on verdict . 'Emotional and psychological hurdles' Those who defend Zimmerman say he will struggle for the rest of his life over what happened, despite his contention that it was in self-defense. ""In his religious beliefs, death by any definition is a tragedy,"" Robert Zimmerman told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""So he has moral things that he's going to have to deal with, and emotional and psychological hurdles he's going to have to overcome."" Those who believe he should be in jail for murder are quick to point out that Martin lost his life, and say there should be no tears shed for any struggles Zimmerman may face. A young man's post on Facebook about Zimmerman's future quickly went viral Sunday. ""For the rest of your life you are now going to feel what its like to be a black man in America,"" Alex Fraser wrote. ""You will feel people stare at you. Judging you for what you think are unfair reasons. You will lose out on getting jobs for something you feel is outside of your control. You will believe yourself to be an upstanding citizen and wonder why people choose to not see that. ... ""I bet you never thought that by shooting a black male you'd end up inheriting all of his struggles."" Fraser added, ""Enjoy your 'freedom.'"" Zimmerman could still be held responsible for Martin's death . Support for Zimmerman . Zimmerman's supporters have sent letters and e-mails to his lawyers, offering moral support and saying they sympathized with a man so concerned about neighborhood break-ins that he bought a gun and dog, and donned the mantle of neighborhood watchman. The letters often blame the media for his woes and offer encouragement for the road ahead. After the verdict, O'Mara too assailed news outlets for their coverage. ""He was like a patient in an operating table where mad scientists were committing experiments on him and he had no anesthesia,"" he said. Many supporters sent in money to a website he established to help with his mounting legal bills. But one crisis public relations manager said Zimmerman must tread lightly when accepting further public money. ""He's got to be careful about who he associates with afterward, even if they are offering financial support,"" said Gene Grabowski. Despite what may lie ahead, on Saturday night, as his legal team surrounded him and congratulated each other with handshakes and hugs, George Zimmerman seemed to take a moment to soak in the relief -- aware that a long road lies ahead.

"(CNN) -- It took 27 years, but Gary Lauder eventually came up with what he sees as the solution to the problem of unnecessary stop signs: a new kind of road sign that tells drivers at some kinds of intersections to ""take turns."" Nearly three decades ago, Lauder, then a college student, was driving at a three-way intersection when he got a ticket ""for not coming to a full and complete stop despite the fact that it was clear that there was nothing to stop for -- other than the hidden police officer who was shooting fish in a barrel."" Now 47, and a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, Lauder said he mulled the matter over for years but didn't focus much effort on it until his proposal to speak about it was accepted for the TED2010 Conference in Long Beach, California. Lauder's idea, described in his 4½ minute talk at TED, is that the new sign could take the place of some stop signs and, in certain circumstances, avoid unnecessary stops, saving time, fuel and carbon emissions, while promoting smooth traffic flow. He estimated that one conventional stop sign on a particular road costs $112,000 a year in fuel and lost time -- and ""turns otherwise honest citizens into lawbreakers."" ""If I had had more time for my talk,"" Lauder said. ""I might have included the ideas behind this quotation: 'Useless laws weaken necessary laws.' -- Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu."" Read more about Lauder on TED.com . Lauder is the managing partner of Lauder Partners LLC, which invests in information technology businesses. He is co-inventor of 10 patents, mostly in the field of interactive television, and, with his wife, Laura, he created the Aspen Institute's Socrates Society, which hosts roundtable discussions. He spoke to CNN Monday. Here is an edited transcript. CNN: Your day job is as a venture capitalist. How did you get involved in the whole issue of traffic? Gary Lauder: We drive, so it's hard to ignore that experience which we all share, and while driving, one's thoughts go to how this can be improved. In particular they were driven there by having received that traffic ticket...a long, long time ago. The whole issue of stop signs making you stop for no one in particular or no one at all, which is often the case, made me think: What is this trying to achieve? And is there not a better way that might make our driving more in sync with common sense and with what's best for the environment and for the driver? So many of these stop signs are there to deal with a possibility of someone coming to the sign. Since it's only a possibility, make it more of a conditional thing -- if there's a car there, then stop, if not, don't. That seems to be a more logical approach. It's just something no one's bothered to do because this hasn't bothered anybody enough to go do it. A crisis is a terrible thing to waste, and we currently have a high level of consciousness of energy and global warming and so forth that's motivating us to do a lot of things differently and better than in the past. It's somewhat analogous to the 1970s energy crisis. That is what caused the East Coast, except for New York City, to adopt right turn on red. Most of the East Coast did not allow right on red until then and my understanding [is] it was allowed for energy saving purposes ... this approach would cause substantial savings without trading off safety. CNN: One technique that's been suggested by urban planners is the roundabout. Lauder: Roundabouts are a wonderful technology that have been well established outside of our country and they're starting to appear more and more in America, but very, very slowly. They're kind of expensive to put in and they sometimes require eminent domain [condemnation] of land around where they're put in. So it's kind of a big deal to put in. Whereas the nice thing about the sign I'm proposing is that it's probably about $200 per location, to take down the old sign and put up a new one, which is obviously a drop in the bucket and could be implemented in a very short time once it was approved. CNN: Talk about the merits of the new sign and where you think they should be placed. Lauder: This is not meant for everywhere. Its best use is for where you have a high level of traffic on the major road and only a minor level of traffic coming in on the minor road ... all the cars all day long on the major road today have to stop for those phantom cars that aren't there. This is meant for situations where you have a three- or four-way intersection that has three- or four-way stop signs. So it's meant to be placed on the major roads, not the minor road. The minor road will still have a stop sign. CNN: In the ideal case, it would accomplish what? Lauder: The idea is it would enable cars to not have to stop if there's no one to stop for, and so not stopping saves gas, which means saving pollution and it saves time, and ... there are lots of law-abiding citizens who consistently break the letter of the law by not coming to a full and complete stop. It's really unfortunate to have laws that compel one to violate common sense and violate what's best for our atmosphere and respect for our wallets. ... This would help bring the law back into sync with common sense. CNN: Do you have a name for this sign? Lauder: I call it the ""take turns"" sign, which unfortunately suffers from a slight ambiguity because there are two meanings of the term ""taking turns."" You can take a turn at an intersection, which means turning right or left, or taking turns means alternating, but I can't think of a better way to express it in our language. CNN: And beyond giving the TED Talk about it, have you proposed this to any government? Lauder: Not yet. I have been looking into how to get this idea in circulation among people where this is their job, traffic engineers ... I am in the process of looking into how to bring this idea to them, but I have not yet figured out a good way. ... I thought this type of idea might best be initiated at a forum like TED. People who attend TED or watch it online are people who enjoy new ideas and would inherently be critical but receptive to things that would improve the world. CNN: What's the reaction been since the TED talk? Lauder: Well it's been remarkable how positively it's been received, mostly in the form of comments on the site, and people posting it and reposting it. And lots of Tweets. There are some negative comments and lots and lots of misunderstanding, but by and large it's been positive. Some of the people who commented on various Web sites noted that there have been signs that urged people to take turns, but those had been in merging situations where there are two lanes that are merging into one. And that's a completely different purpose. ... So the reaction has been very positive, and that encouragement has been important to me in wanting to help make the idea into a reality.

"(CNN) -- America's economy has the potential to transform lives like no other force on Earth, but too often in recent years we have seen Washington act as an anchor. And while CEOs and presidents may generate the business headlines, an over-involved federal government hurts employees and those looking for jobs across the entire spectrum. As someone who grew up in poverty, watching his single mother work 16-hour days to provide as much as she possibly could for us, I have lived the power of the American Dream. With help from my mom and my mentor, I learned that I didn't have to be an entertainer or an athlete to achieve my goals; I could think my way out of poverty. I realized the power of education, and the incredible opportunities provided by free markets. Sen. Cory Booker: Finishing our nation's unfinished business . My fear is that too many folks these days aren't given the chance to see the greatness that resides within them. Over the past 50 years, we've seen the War on Poverty struggle in its core mission -- to help lift folks up. It's time for a change, so I have introduced my Opportunity Agenda. A significant part of my Opportunity Agenda is focused on job-training efforts. There are 4 million open jobs across the country right now -- jobs that are unfilled because of a skills gap in the work force. This in spite of the fact there are 35 federal work-force development programs. My SKILLS Act, which the House has already passed thanks to the efforts of Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, would cut through the bureaucratic maze and mountains of red tape that hinder these programs. We'll create one Workforce Investment Fund, cutting waste and duplication out while ensuring more dollars are used for their actual purpose -- job training. President Barack Obama signaled that Vice President Joe Biden would be looking at job-training programs this year -- I eagerly await their call to discuss my proposal. I am also working on a proposal to create opportunity zones across America to tie some of the tax dollars coming out of our low-income communities to the community itself in order to rebuild infrastructure and lift those areas up. In my time on county council in Charleston County, this concept was referred to as Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts, and I see great potential in this concept at the federal level. It is not enough to simply rebuild, or as some would call it gentrify, our tougher neighborhoods -- we have to provide the opportunity to the folks living there already to take part in a brighter future. Population shifting isn't fixing the problem, it is simply moving it somewhere else. So instead of overtaxing and overregulating, I see a future where the government cuts out waste and duplication, and gives all Americans the chance to realize their full potential. As I travel throughout South Carolina, be it speaking with a local chamber of commerce, or a group of pastors, or working at a burrito store for a morning (verdict: my own skills with a broom could stand some polishing), my constituents are very clear: They don't want a handout, just a hand up. It isn't the federal government's responsibility to guarantee outcomes. It is, however, our responsibility to make sure that a better future is possible if people want it. Opportunity knocks for all of us at some point. My hope is that Washington doesn't get in the way of folks answering. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Meet Syria. The Border Collie is just 13 weeks old and was dumped by its owners. In the adjoining kennel eight boxer cross puppies have been similarly abandoned. Syria the border collie: One of the animals awaiting new owners at a dog re-homing center. Bruno is also waiting for a new home as the owner of the bullmastiff cross moved into a flat which does not allow pets. These are just a few of the animals currently being cared for at a re-homing center in London run by the Dogs Trust, the largest dog charity in the UK. ""Our center is now full. We have more dogs coming into the center than going out. At this time last year, we had half as many dogs,"" says manager Richard Moore. Other dog shelters and re-homing centers across the country are also at bursting point as a result of an increase in requests for re-homing and a decrease in people wanting to take on the responsibility of looking after a dog. With insurance, food, grooming and toys, a dog's life can come with a price tag of £15,000 ($22,500), according to the Dogs Trust. And with millions of households tightening their belts as the credit crunch bites, some are opting give up their pets. The increase in requests for re-homing is attributed to the financial crisis. Owners either have to move to dog-unfriendly accommodation or can no longer afford to care for the animal after losing their job. ""Moving as a result of the credit crunch is the number one factor for giving up a dog,"" explains Moore. ""People also ring up to say they can't afford to look after their dog anymore, because they've been made redundant."" On top of overcrowding, animal rescue charities face another problem; they rely on charity donations and are likely to suffer in those terms. ""The expected increase in unemployment and decrease of disposable income is going to affect the donations,"" says Moore. Another concern for dog charities is that animals are given as Christmas presents. Unfortunately some of these dogs turn up at the re-homing center in the New Year as unwanted gifts. But dark times may be a good time to start looking after a dog, says Moore: ""With the love and the care, the relationship that a dog can bring to you at a depressing time like this, is incredible. I have six dogs and certainly when coming home at night they put a smile on my face.""","Dog re-homing centers in UK at bursting point as owners dump their pets .

"LINCOLN, Nebraska (CNN) -- Sherry Pierce, who works at a fast food restaurant that doesn't offer health insurance, needs a dentist to look at three broken teeth that may be abscessed. Dr. Shawn Semin examines Gotti Water, 6, at Clinic with a Heart. Gotti had ringworm. Diabetic Shane Stender says his poor health cost him his job as a pizza cook and now he can't afford supplies to monitor his blood sugar. Home health aide Nina Forst wants a doctor to check out a rash on her son Gotti's head. Pierce, Stender and Gotti were among 52 patients who arrived one evening this week at Clinic with a Heart in Lincoln, Nebraska. The weekly clinic offers free care to those falling through the cracks of the health care system, says Dr. Rob Rhodes, a family physician who is president and founder of the clinic. In these tough economic times, business is booming. The clinic expects to see more than 2,000 patients this year, up from 1,400 last year, according to Rhodes. ""The economy has definitely affected the number of patients that we see,"" he says. ""We have a large group, and it's growing, of those that are uninsured or choose not to choose an insurance plan or can't afford to sign up a family of four."" The frenetic Tuesday night clinic, staffed by volunteer doctors, nurses and others from the community, offers free medical, dental, chiropractic, optometry and mental health services in offices borrowed from a local charity on the edge of this Midwestern city of 240,000.  Watch more on Clinic with a Heart » . Often, patients will try to see more than one type of doctor while they're there. Patients who need to see a specialist are referred to a network of participating doctors in Lincoln, assigned on a rotating basis, who charge at or below Medicaid costs. Those who need primary care doctors are referred to The People's Health Center, a federally funded, non-profit community health center that charges a sliding fee scale. Rhodes says his clinic is designed to serve only as a stopgap. Patients are limited to three visits a year. ""When patients come to see us, they don't know where to go for health care coverage,"" Rhodes says. ""Maybe they can't afford to see the doctor they used to see, and they're looking for help. They're looking for direction, and we try to provide them with an entry point for the health care system."" Pierce learned she needed three teeth removed. She scheduled a visit the following morning at the University of Nebraska College of Dentistry, which would extract them for free. ""No health insurance makes it hard,"" says Pierce. If it wasn't for Clinic with a Heart Pierce says she would have left her teeth untreated because she can't afford a hospital bill. ""I thank the Lord for this place here because they're a blessing."" A blood test at the clinic showed Stender's blood sugar was 419, almost three times what it should be. ""I'm a chronic diabetic. Insulin dependent. Unemployed. Can't afford my supplies,"" says Stender. The clinic gave Stender a prescription for insulin and a device to measure his blood sugar, picking up the tab for both. They also scheduled Stender for follow-up with a primary care doctor in Lincoln. ""Had he not had any medical care here tonight, he probably would have ended up in the emergency department or in the hospital in the next several days,"" says Dr. Nicole Anderson, a hospitalist who volunteers as the clinic's medical director. A volunteer doctor diagnosed ringworm, a fungal infection, in Forst's son Gotti, 6. He gave Forst a prescription she could fill at no charge. ""It was great. We got in and out. We weren't here very long, and we got a prescription,"" Forst said. Rhodes got the idea for Clinic with a Heart after going on a medical mission trip with his church to Reynosa, Mexico, in 2002. ""I thought, my gosh if we can do that, there's got to be some way we can provide care to those people back in Lincoln, Nebraska, in our back yard, that are falling between the cracks."" A national survey shows Americans are struggling to pay for health care amid other financial woes. In March, 28.7 percent of those surveyed said a member of the household deferred medical care in the previous 30 days, up from 23.7 percent a month earlier, according to the monthly National Research Corporation Ticker survey. Asked why, 33 percent said they were unable to pay; 26.8 percent said they had no insurance and 15.1 percent said the treatment was not covered by their health plan, according to the monthly survey of 25,000 households nationwide. In Lincoln, Clinic with a Heart is thriving, Rhodes says, but he wishes it weren't. He says he'd love to be put out of business.","Free clinic offers care to those falling through the cracks of the health care system .

"(CNN) -- The lack of a cause of death, a lengthy trial and the possibility that Caylee Anthony's death was accidental were probably factors in the acquittal of her mother, Casey, on the most serious charges, according to attorneys and analysts. Defense attorney Bruce Poston said he, like many others, was initially surprised by the verdict, which came Tuesday after less than 11 hours of deliberations by a Florida jury. But on reflection, he said, he realized jurors were given a circumstantial case. And, Poston said, there was no evidence of premeditation by Casey Anthony. ""She didn't have to kill the child,"" he said. ""Her parents would have raised this child."" The jury found Anthony not guilty of first-degree murder and the other most serious charges against her in the 2008 death of Caylee, 2. But it convicted her on four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to law enforcement officers. Jurors would not immediately comment on their decision. They apparently believed Anthony was involved in an accidental death of her daughter and covered it up, but did not intend to kill her, according to New Jersey defense attorney Remi Spencer. ""This is a home run for the defense,"" the former prosecutor said of the verdict. Tommy Pope, who prosecuted Susan Smith in the 1994 drowning deaths of her two little boys, said the jury evidently took the state's burden of proof seriously. ""A high-profile case like this is exponentially more pressure on everybody,"" said the attorney, who now serves in the South Carolina House. Smith was convicted of two counts of murder, but South Carolina jurors opted to spare her the death penalty. She is serving a life sentence. ""We don't want to think mothers do this,"" said Pope, who was York County solicitor. Anthony's defense attorneys maintained the child drowned in the Anthonys' above-ground pool July 16 and that Anthony and her father panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death. George Anthony denied that in his testimony. Alternate juror Russell Huekler told HLN it appeared the Anthony family didn't know how to deal with a ""horrific accident"" and that he believed that Casey's father, George, was ""hiding something."" According to analysts, jurors got past Casey Anthony's questionable behavior after Caylee disappeared: The defendant partied at Orlando nightclubs and participated in a ""hot body"" contest at one point, according to testimony. Jurors were able to focus on the evidence, or lack of it, Poston said. ""It is just an extraordinary refutation of the prosecution,"" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""Casey Anthony was convicted of extremely minor crimes, compared with the potential death penalty she faced."" Toobin and Poston, an attorney in Knoxville, Tennessee, said they believed that the prosecution overcharged Anthony. ""This was not a first-degree murder case. They should have charged her with more modest crimes and would have had a better chance,"" Toobin said. But Charles Mittelstadt, a criminal defense investigator based in Atlanta, said the prosecution would have looked like it was not confident if it had done so. ""In a capital case, you are generally going for it all,"" Mittelstadt said, adding he believes the jury closely followed deliberation instructions from Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. Prosecutors alleged that Anthony used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious and then duct-taped her mouth and nose to suffocate her. They alleged that she put the child's body in the trunk of her car for a few days before disposing of it. Forensics testimony centered on odor from the car trunk, garbage, stains and flies. Huekler said he had a difficult time accepting that Caylee's body had been in the car trunk. Lawson Lamar, state attorney for the 9th District, praised the job done by prosecutors but said that proving the case was tough, as Caylee's remains were skeletal when they were discovered and lacked any chemical evidence. ""This was a dry-bones case,"" Lamar said. ""The delay in recovering little Caylee's remains worked to our considerable disadvantage."" Jury selection was moved to Pinellas County because of extensive publicity surrounding the case in the Orlando area, and the jurors have been sequestered in an Orlando hotel for the trial. They heard the case over 36 days. ""You think jurors remember (all) that stuff?"" Poston asked. Observers said that both prosecutors and defense attorneys were competent and that the state's summation against Anthony was particularly strong. Pope told CNN prosecutors ""did what they had to do,"" but ""your evidence is what it is."" Prosecutor Paul Henderson, who also played no role in the trial, told CNN's Anderson Cooper he was ""shocked and disappointed"" with the verdict. But, he acknowledged, circumstantial cases like this one ""are tough cases when you're proving a homicide."" Poston said jurors appeared to take a liking during the trial to Baez, who greeted them each day. ""It got to be where all 12 would in unison say 'good morning' "" in return, Poston said. Although Baez was constantly challenged by prosecutors and lost many rulings, jurors saw none of those exchanges, observers said. Spencer said she didn't believe jurors based their verdict on the attorneys. ""I believe you win the case during the cross-examination of the witnesses,"" she said. ""I don't think the trial was won or lost on the closings (summations)."" Spencer said she was not surprised by the verdict. She cited the lack of direct evidence, including any incriminating DNA found on tape attached to the little girl's skull. Forensics evidence, she said, ""backfired"" on prosecutors. ""I think that this verdict was the only logical verdict,"" prominent defense attorney Mark Geragos told CNN's Cooper. ""The prosecution woefully fell flat in this case at all times. They're the ones who invested themselves in this guilt-by-character-assassination ... they didn't have actual evidence."" Mittelstadt said the state appeared to have a compelling point in questioning why it took 31 days for Anthony to go to police if it were an accidental death. ""That is pretty strong stuff to dispute,"" he said. But publicity about wrongful convictions and post-conviction exonerations has made jurors increasingly wary in death penalty cases, Mittelstadt said. ""Jurors don't want to be part of that mistake when someone's life is on the line,"" he said. In the end, observers said, it's difficult to predict what a jury will do. For Poston, the verdict showed that the circumstances of Caylee's fate never came to light. ""The jury said, 'We don't know how she died.' ""","NEW: Prosecutor in Susan Smith case weighs in .

"(CNN) -- Fifty years ago, President John F. Kennedy came to Houston and told the world that the United States would go to the moon before the end of the 1960s. On Friday, Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center is announcing its own ""Moon Shots Program,"" aimed at significantly reducing the number of deaths from a handful of cancers by the end of this decade. Inspired by Kennedy's words, Dr. Ronald DePinho, president of the large cancer treatment and research center, is launching this project in two parallel tracks: ""One is to apply the existing knowledge, to make a near-term impact in this decade,"" he said. ""The second is to also say, 'We do not know everything we need to know to ultimately cure the disease.'"" The cancer center calls the program ""an unprecedented effort to dramatically accelerate the pace of converting scientific discoveries into clinical advances that reduce cancer deaths."" ""The Moon Shots Program signals our confidence that the path to curing cancer is in clearer sight than at any other time in history,"" DePinho says. Doctors at MD Anderson believe that dying from cancer can eventually be as rare as dying from pneumonia. And DePinho believes this can happen sooner rather later for patients suffering from the following five types of cancer: . -- lung cancer . -- melanoma . -- triple negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer (which are very similar on the molecular level) -- prostate cancer . -- acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome & chronic lymphocytic leukemia (blood cancers) These types of cancers were chosen by a panel of 25 experts from within and outside MD Anderson based on what's known about prevention, treatment and survivorship as well as the likelihood of reducing the number of deaths. Lung cancer is the No. 1 cancer killer worldwide, in part because the cancer is usually found when it's already spread. A good way to screen for this cancer is still elusive. That's why good screening tools are so crucial. ""If you catch stage 1 lung cancer, you're dealing with about a 20%, mortality as opposed to advanced-stage cancers where you're dealing with about 10% survival,"" DePinho tells CNN. One of MD Anderson's experts has developed a blood test in mice that can more accurately determine who should have a CT screening. Part of this ""moon shot"" will include making this test useful in humans. Skin cancer, meanwhile, is the most common form of cancer, but it's usually not fatal, except for the 5% who are diagnosed with the deadliest form: melanoma. Cancer now No. 1 killer of U.S. Hispanics . DePinho says he's leveraging the knowledge gained from treating more than 100,000 patients each year with the skills of the thousands of doctors and researchers to significantly improve the detection, treatment and survival rates of cancer, as well as preventing the disease in the first place. Forty years after President Richard Nixon declared war on cancer, MD Anderson plans to move the battle to a new level by taking advantage of the many technological advances. For example, doctors can now analyze the DNA of a patient or a tumor in a matter of hours and for only hundreds of dollars, something that took 10 years and cost billions when the first genome was sequenced. Knowing specifics about a patient's genetics can help doctors determine who will benefit from an existing drug and who will not, so patients aren't wasting time and money on a very expensive drug that will not help their cancer. The cancer center is backing this project with a $3 billion investment over the next decade. ""Those funds will come from institutional earnings, philanthropy, competitive research grants and commercialization of new discoveries,"" he says. The project is scheduled to launch in February 2013. Stress, depression may affect cancer survival .

"(CNN)  -- ""Bull in the ring"" is a drill almost as old as football. Several members of the team form a ring around a single player. The player in the middle begins a nervous shuffle, eyes darting, arms tense, as his teammates, one at a time, fling their bodies toward him at full force. He is the target of tackle after tackle, and if he moves too slowly the hits can be punishing. For many coaches, ""bull in the ring"" is an exercise in agility and mental fortitude. Others consider it violent. Until recently, Carmen Roda, a youth football coach in Westport, Connecticut, did the drill with fifth-graders. ""Head to head, hammer to hammer,"" is how Roda, president of the Westport Police Athletic League, described players crashing into one another during the drill. ""It's really more about aggression, not technique. The old school of coaching football is that aggression."" When his team chalked up 20 concussions during the 2009 season, Roda decided that he needed to usher in ""new school"" coaching, focusing more on technique and less on aggression. One of the first steps was getting rid of ""bull in the ring."" ""The game 20 years ago is not the game today, so why not teach it differently,"" said Roda, who has coached football for 15 years. ""Coaches, especially at the youth level, have to be open to that because we're talking about kids."" Roda's revelation came after reading the book ""Head Games, Football's Concussion Crisis,"" written by former Harvard University football player and WWE wrestler Chris Nowinski. Nowinski said that while aggression is endemic to football, there are ways to make the game safer. ""Can you ever make football so that no one gets hurt? No. People are going to get hurt,"" said Nowinski, president of the Sports Legacy Institute. ""But you can eliminate certain drills, you modify certain drills, minimize certain drills...eliminate dumb things like 'bull in the ring.'"" Nowinski is a passionate advocate in part because concussions ended his wrestling career in 2004. Ex-NFL stars after concussion: Lives unraveled . Years later, when a mysterious, degenerative brain disease resembling dementia -- called chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- was described in athletes with repeated head trauma, Nowinski became a more outspoken advocate, especially for kids playing football. The first described cases of CTE were in deceased former NFL players, but recently the Boston University Medical School Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, which Nowinski co-founded, described CTE in the brain of an 18-year-old athlete. ""We have cases of teenagers, guys who never played pro sports, getting CTE and dying young,"" said Nowinski, who added that dramatic changes are needed in football. Concussion extra dangerous to teen brains . ""If we aren't talking about making relatively dramatic changes to the game in a public way...then people are OK with kids getting a degenerative brain disease from playing football,"" Nowinski said. Roda addressed the concussion issue in the Westport league by requiring preseason concussion education courses for all coaches, players and parents. He also reduced the amount of tackling during practice. ""Our kids hit maybe once or twice a week for short periods of time,"" Roda said. ""And in the beginning of the season, we go without helmets, moving through the mechanics of tackling and blocking because the brain's smart, right? As soon as kids see [the head is] going to get hurt, the head snaps back automatically."" Practicing without helmets, Roda said, conditions kids to tackle with the head up instead of leading into tackles helmet-first, which is more likely to cause brain injury. He also has a certified athletic trainer attend all practices and games to evaluate players when a concussion is suspected. ""If a kid came out [of a game], he got a hard hit, what we used to call a 'stinger' or a 'ding,' we would simply ask 'Are you OK?' and send him back in if he said yes,"" Roda said. ""Now if we see a kid with a big hit, we're checking on them to see if they're OK, and we're asking different kinds of questions to get the answers."" Roda said parents and coaches were resistant at first to the new rules. They were concerned about ""weakening"" the game. But most came around when they realized what was at stake for the children and, according to Roda, when the team continued to win. This past season, Roda's Westport Wreckers made it to the league championship game and had 50% fewer concussions. ""The dramatic thing was that they were still good,"" said Nowinski, who has conducted concussion safety presentations for parents and coaches in Westport. ""It did not hurt the kids' ability to play the game. It just dramatically lowered their injury rate and their head trauma rate."" The new rules in Westport are part of a growing (although sometimes grudging) movement to make football safer for children -- whose brains are still developing and thus particularly susceptible to concussion. Last year, the American Academy of Neurologists recommended immediately removing an athlete suspected of suffering a concussion from the game, not allowing players back on the field until they receive medical clearance, and having a certified trainer at every game. Warner: Playing through concussion 'part of the game' Similar rules appear in the Zackery Lystedt law, passed in Washington in 2009. It is named after a 17-year-old who suffered a devastating brain injury after returning to play too soon after a concussion. A handful of other states have passed similar legislation. While Nowinski is encouraged by the progress, he said that many youth football coaches continue to teach aggression. ""You have to pose this question to people to get them to think about it: Are you OK with destroying a kid's brain for this game? If you are, then let's keep going exactly as we've been going,"" Nowinski said. ""If you're not, let's really put our heads together with people who can actually make the changes and let's do it.""","Carmen Roda wants to usher in ""new school"" coaching .

"Washington (CNN) -- They are the size of marshmallows and the colors of peppermint twists. And because some small children think they might be treats, laundry detergent gel packs -- which recently hit the market -- are proving to be a potential home hazard. Authorities in the United States and in the United Kingdom say there has been an uptick in phone calls and hospitalizations resulting from children who have swallowed or otherwise been exposed to the gel packs of highly concentrated laundry detergent, perhaps believing them to be candy. U.S. poison hotlines have received 2,950 calls concerning exposures to children 5 and under so far this year, with 734 calls in August alone. Not all exposures are poisonings or overdoses. No deaths have been reported. Powerful magnets in toys raise risks from swallowing . ""Because they are colorful and squishy, they are attractive to children,"" warns the American Association of Poison Control Centers. ""They can look like candy or something fun to play with."" But the capsules contain strong alkaline cleaning agents that can destroy tissue and cause intense inflammation and swelling, according to the authors of an article in the British Medical Journal. Some children who swallowed the packets have become very ill and required hospitalization, the poison controls group said. Some children have experienced excessive vomiting, wheezing and gasping. New York City's poison hotline received its first call about the gel packs in April, and has received about 40 more since then, most from hospitals, said Health Department spokeswoman Chanel Caraway. ""It is something new that we're seeing,"" Caraway said. ""These are basically brand new to the market and once they started hitting the market is when we started seeing (reports of exposures)."" In May, the U.S. poison centers highlighted the issue, urging parents to store concentrated detergents out of reach of young children. And the American Cleaning Institute (ACI), an organization representing producers and distributors in the cleaning products industry, advises consumers to store the detergents ""out of reach and out of sight of children."" ACI: Doing Laundry -- The Safe Way . On its website (www.cleaninginstitute.org), the organization has guidance on safe use and storage of ""single unit dose laundry detergent packets."" Included is the phone number -- 1-800-222-1222 -- to call to reach a poison center in the United States. ""Detergent manufacturers are re-emphasizing the importance of keeping single unit dose laundry detergent packets out of the reach of children, in the wake of recent reports about children accidentally ingesting these products,"" Brian Sansoni, ACI vice president, told CNN Wednesday. ""We are obviously very concerned whenever these situations occur."" ACI: Safe Laundry Practices . In the United Kingdom, the National Poisoning Information Service received 647 phone calls and almost 4,000 online searches about the eating/swallowing of the contents of liquid detergent capsules, from health care professionals in the last year, according to an article published Wednesday in the British Medical Journal. In the UK, doctors are calling for improved safety warnings and childproof packaging for the ""liquitabs"" after a cluster of five incidents in which toddlers inadvertently swallowed the capsules, the Journal reports. The cases were reported in the ""Archives of Disease in Childhood."" All five children were admitted to one hospital in Glasgow, Scotland, as emergencies with four requiring intubations for several days to treat swelling. In one child, the swelling was so severe it required surgery. ""All the children recovered, but... the incidents had 'a catastrophic impact on the child and family,'"" the Journal reported.","In August alone, U.S. poison centers got 734 calls regarding children and detergent gel packs .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Harvey Schwartz spent the past 40 years collecting antiques, art and odd items that he rented to TV and movie studios as props and set decorations. These ""aliens"" are among the items to be auctioned off by 20th Century Props. During a tour of his huge North Hollywood, California, warehouse, Schwartz, owner of 20th Century Props, opened a morgue vault door, revealing the legs of a crusty corpse, built for the ""X-Files"" TV series. ""Fun piece,"" he said with a smile. ""Love the sound effects."" Schwartz must now sell everything -- including a submarine, a fake nuclear warhead and Austin Powers' cryogenic chamber -- at auction because of a dramatic decline in Hollywood productions over the past year.  Watch a tour of the prop warehouse » . ""I guess it would be the end of Hollywood as I know it and for everyone, because there won't be any place to get all these products again,"" Schwartz said. While 2009 has been a good year at the box office, more production is leaving Los Angeles for states that offer tax incentives unmatched by California. ""It's very, very tough,"" said Jack Kyser, economist for the Los Angeles Economic Development Commission. ""If you are doing feature film production, you are probably going to go out of state because 44 other states have been offering incentives for feature film productions. California just started their incentive program."" With companies spending less on advertising in a down economy, broadcast TV is suffering and people who make commercials have less work, Kyser said. The writers' strike last year and the stalled actors union contract talks added to the slowdown, and it's getting even tougher for struggling young actors and writers pursuing their Hollywood dreams, he said. ""We have a slang phrase: 'There's a lot of WAMs out there: waiters, actors, models',"" Kyser said. ""And if you go to restaurants you see the wait staff is looking better and better all the time, physically."" Stephon Fuller, an actor who moved to Los Angeles 11 years ago, said, ""It's never been this quiet for me."" Still, Fuller said he expected auditions for new roles to pick up later in the summer. On-location film shoots dropped 25 percent overall in the first half of the year, including a 50 percent loss in feature film production in Los Angeles, according to a group that helps process filming permits. ""If you are doing a feature film you have to rent equipment, you have to rent props,"" Kyser said ""If you go out on location you have to rent a truck to take you there, you have to have a location caterer, and all these people are feeling the pain."" Schwartz, 67, started suffering last year with a 40 percent drop in business, and it has gotten worse in recent months. ""I just can't hold on any longer,"" he said. ""I've run out of money."" An auctioneer will begin the long process of selling everything Tuesday morning. ""I talk lightly that I have 93,752 pieces under this roof, but it doesn't really strike a note until you start putting a little auction lot number on each piece or a bunch of pieces."" Potential bidders have registered from dozens of countries, and hundreds are expected to show up at the warehouse, Schwartz said. Visitors can be overwhelmed by what they see in Schwartz' warehouse. The largest item on the block is a 162-foot-long submarine built for ""Down Periscope,"" a 1996 comedy starring Kelsey Grammer. It's not seaworthy -- since it actually never left a movie sound stage -- and it will be an expensive job moving it. Complete with torpedoes, it has been used in several TV productions in recent years, Schwartz said. The nuclear warhead John Travolta used in his 1996 film ""Broken Arrow"" will also be sold, along with the cryogenic tube used to preserve the Mike Myers character in ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,"" an identical tube that housed a frozen Gary Coleman and Dr. Evil's escape egg.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- NASA released newly restored videos Thursday of two U.S. astronauts taking the world's first steps on the moon. NASA hired a digital restoration firm to improve video showing astronauts taking first steps on the moon. The images were released just four days before the 40th anniversary of the historic event that captivated the world on July 20, 1969. The release, part of a larger Apollo 11 moonwalk restoration project, features 15 key moments from the historic lunar excursion, NASA said in a statement. Astronaut Neil Armstrong, now 78, was the first to venture onto the moon's surface after the lunar module Eagle landed on the so-called Sea of Tranquility. Following him was Buzz Aldrin, now 79. The videos are far superior to the initial dark, fuzzy images people watched on their television sets at the time, although they are far from crisp.  Watch a clearer view of ""one small step for man"" » . The original tapes of images sent back to Earth by Apollo 11 have been lost, and the camera that shot them was left on the moon, according to a NASA official. Given those circumstances, the team of Apollo-era engineers who helped produce the 1969 live broadcast of the moonwalk acquired the best of the broadcast-format video from a variety of places. These images were turned over to a firm specializing in digitized video restorations, said Mark Hess, chief of public affairs at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. ""It was the very best of the broadcast video that we were able to locate from all the sources,"" he said, referring to any place that had the original broadcast. ""The quality of those varied widely."" One source was kinescopes found in film vaults at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston that had not been seen for 36 years, NASA said. Kinescopes are the motion-picture records of a television program. NASA is fairly sure that the original tapes were placed in storage, and taken out and used in the 1970s and 1980s, Hess said. ""Once that technology became irrelevant, they were probably destroyed,"" Hess said. These are just the first restored videos to be released, he said. NASA expects that by September, the firm will have worked on the entire moonwalk, and the quality of those videos -- about three hours worth -- will be even better than today's. The company NASA used, Lowry Digital of Burbank, California, specializes in restoring old Hollywood films and video. iReport.com: Where were you during the moon landing? The images posted Thursday on the NASA Web site include a two-minute video montage with highlights of the moonwalk, and separate videos of Armstrong and Aldrin descending a ladder to the moon's dusty surface.

Another comparison video shows Armstrong reading a commemorative plaque on the lunar module, which says in part: ""Here men from the planet Earth first stepped upon the moon -- July 1969.""

"(CNN) -- I was in my office last week when a 14-year-old soccer player came in with her parents. She told me a story that is, unfortunately, very common. She had been at practice when she planted her foot, twisted her knee and went down in a heap. ""I felt a pop,"" she said. Even before examining her knee, I knew it wasn't going to be good news. The knee was swollen, the first indication that bleeding inside the joint, called a hemarthrosis, had occurred. I pulled on her knee to test the ligaments and unfortunately, my suspicions were confirmed. She had torn her anterior cruciate ligament. Because of its poor blood supply and location inside the knee, the ACL has the unfortunate distinction of being the ligament in the knee with the worst healing potential. This is important since the ACL has the most important job, keeping the femur (thigh bone) and the tibia (leg bone) moving in unison during twisting maneuvers. ACL injury is a buzz word among athletes. In young athletes, it's an unfortunate reality, as they are occurring at increasing rates over the past two decades. In part it's because more children are playing competitive sports and doing so at a younger ages. But they are also playing longer seasons and sometimes all year. Now the American Academy of Pediatrics is advising doctors in a new clinical report on the best ways to approach and treat ACL injuries in children. Teens who play sports have heard about the injury and know it isn't good. What they don't quite realize, however, are the future implications. Famous athletes such as quarterback Tom Brady and alpine skier Lindsey Vonn have come back after ACL surgery, so how bad can it be? The truth is that surgery can restore knee function, but it does little to diminish the risk of arthritis 15 to 20 years down the line. Regardless of whether an athlete has surgery, the risk of arthritis skyrockets later in life from an ACL tear. Kids who tear their ACL today are often left with 60-year-old knees when they're 30. If parents and coaches realized the long-term implications of an ACL injury, I think they'd be more attuned to prevention. Multiple studies have demonstrated that strong muscles, particularly the landing muscles in the hips, glutes and hamstrings, can prevent ACL injuries from happening. There are many resources to develop strength programs, including the PEP program and The ACL Solution. These and other programs are easy to implement at home or practice and twice per week is enough to make a difference. The new American Academy of Pediatrics report advocates this kind of training. Demand that your youth sports programs have ACL prevention programs. If they don't, set them up. Although boys and girls are at risk for ACL injury, post-pubertal girls are at least four times more likely to tear their ACL than boys. Parents can and should intervene to make sure their kids are safe. When I see young athletes who tear their ACL, one of the first questions their parents ask is: What could we have done to prevent this? The answer: everything.","The anterior cruciate ligament, inside the knee, serves a crucial function .

A new report recommends training to prevent ACL injuries ."
"Beijing (CNN) -- Flooding in China's north and south caused by heavy rain has left at least 107 dead and inundated roads and farmland, the government and state media said. Three provinces in China's northeast bore the brunt of the floods with 85 dead and 105 missing in Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning as of 4pm on Monday, the government said. A total of 37 million residents in that region were affected by flood waters, Xinhua said, which were described by a local newspaper as the worst in 50 years in Liaoning province. More than 787,000 hectares of farmland in the region, a major grain growing area, were flooded and pictures showed roads in many urban areas looking more like rivers. Xinhua said that the People's Liberation Army had been mobilized to carry out rescue work. At the opposite end of the country, rainfall in the wake of Typhoon Utor, which made landfall in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong last week, has killed 22 people and caused 8.6 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) of damage there. Dykes ruptured near Shantou in eastern Guangdong flooding low-lying homes and killing 10. Some internet users criticized the official response to the floods. ""Government rescue is too slow. They send troops overseas for military exercise, but don't care about its own people,"" said a user of the Twitter-like Sina Weibo with the name @Lingchenliangdinan.

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Argentina's Supreme Court has upheld a ruling that will decriminalize abortions in cases of rape. Tuesday's ruling will ease what has been a very strict interpretation of the tough anti-abortion laws on the books. ""The statute has been on the books more than 80 years. However, there were contradictory interpretations by lower courts throughout the country, and these interpretations, in some cases, said that women who were raped are only permitted an abortion if they are mentally challenged or demented, which is what the statute says,"" said Alvaro Herrero of the Association of Civil Rights. ""The court made a clarification about this issue and said that in all cases in which there was rape there exists the right to an abortion."" Abortion is illegal in Argentina. As interpreted, in addition to cases of mental incapacity, the law only permitted abortions in some instances in which the mother's life was at risk. The original case involved a 15-year-old girl who became pregnant after being raped by her stepfather. A lower court ruled in March 2010 that an abortion was permissible in cases of rape, but that decision was appealed to the nation's highest court. In its ruling, the Supreme Court clarified that Argentina's Constitution and human rights treaties would not allow such a prohibition in cases of rape. ""On the contrary, they forbid punishing all victims of rape in accordance to the principles of equality, personal dignity, and legality,"" the country's center for judicial information reported. The ruling also specified that judicial authorization is not needed before performing an abortion. The only necessary declaration is the patient's statement that she was raped, the court ruled. Despite the country's tough anti-abortion laws, the health ministry estimates that some 460,000 abortions are performed each year in Argentina. The ministry estimated that about 100 women die each year because the procedures were not carried out with the required medical expertise. Roberto Castaneda, a member of an Argentine pro-life group, said despite the ruling, there are other options besides abortion. ""A woman who has difficulties must have assistance. Legal, medical, psychological assistance. We have to promote the adoption system. There are thousands of couples in Argentina without children and who can't have children. It is a much more humane situation than killing,"" he said. The head of Argentina's bishops conference, Monsignor Jose Maria Arancedo, said he was surprised to hear of the court's decision. ""Abortion is the suppression of an innocent life, and there does not exist any motive or reason that justifies the elimination of an innocent life, not even the unfortunate case of a rape,"" he said. CNN's Javier Doberti contributed to this report.","Abortion is illegal in Argentina .

"(CNN) -- Sara Hammon saw some of her sisters pulled out of school to be married to men they didn't know. She dreaded a similar fate. And so, she ran away from home before she was old enough to drive legally. Sara Hammon says the prospect of an arranged marriage was ""like marching to the guillotine."" She left behind 19 mothers, 74 siblings, and a father she says could never remember her name, even though he repeatedly molested her. And, she left behind a culture she says was oppressive for young women. Hammon recently gave CNN a deeply disturbing account of her life inside the polygamous sect whose leader, Warren Jeffs, goes on trial this week in Utah. Jeffs is accused of being an accomplice to rape. The charge stems from his alleged practice of arranging polygamous marriages between child brides and older male followers. Hammon is not directly involved in the charges against Jeffs, which concern an arranged marriage between a girl, 14 and her 19-year-old cousin. She left the sect before she could be placed in an arranged marriage. But she is one of its most outspoken former members. Watch Hammon describe her escape from a closed world » . ""Probably the worst part of the whole theology,"" she said, "" is the treatment of women and teaching women that they are not equal to men."" ""They have to have a husband in order to get to the highest degree of heaven, and not only a husband but they have to allow the husband to have two other wives,"" she added. Hammon was born in Hilldale, Utah, and raised in Colorado City, Arizona, towns where followers of Jeffs -- the President and Prophet, Seer and Revelator of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) -- freely practice polygamy.  Hear the words of the prophet » . The FLDS broke more than a century ago from the mainline Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, over the practice of polygamy. The Mormon church, which gave up plural marriage more than a century ago, has renounced Jeffs' group. Hammon was the first 14-year-old girl to successfully leave the FLDS, she said. Almost 20 years later, she recalls the time she spent inside the compound as being filled with fear. She speaks out as part of her work with The Hope Organization, a non-profit group based in St. George, Utah, that assists victims of abusive polygamous relationships. ""There was a tremendous amount of abuse in our home,"" Hammon said. ""It happened on a daily basis and there was all kinds: sexual, physical, emotional, mental. My brothers were sexually abusive. Some of my mothers were physically abusive."" But it was her father -- an FLDS church leader -- who terrified her. He began sexually abusing her before she turned 5, Hammon said. He even tried to molest her on his deathbed when she was 13, she said. ""For me, he was a very mean person. I didn't know him while we lived in the same house for 13 years and he had to ask me my name every time he saw me. ""In fact, the question he would ask is, 'What is your name and who is your mother?' and that was the only way he could identify that I was his child,"" Hammon said. Three of her older sisters were placed in marriages before they finished high school, including one who was 16 when she married a 62-year-old man, Hammon said. She recalled that one sister had two days notice before her wedding. Hammon said girls in the compound were prepared for a similar destiny all their lives, but she knew from a young age she didn't want any part of it. ""It was like marching to the guillotine because I saw pictures of my mother before she got married and she was just so confident. ""Her posture was just excellent and she had a beautiful face and smile... and then I watched her deteriorate after she got married and I watched her go through so much emotional pain and that was what I felt was in store for me if I got married,"" she said. Hammon described her father's wives as second-class citizens in the household who became shells of themselves the moment he came into the room. She called it mind control. Her mother had more than two dozen nervous breakdowns, she said. ""I don't know how a woman can allow another woman to come into her home and cook some supper up with the family for her and go to bed with her husband that night and respect herself. ""I don't see how that is possible. You have to let a part of yourself go. A part of something in you, you have to squash that down in order to live with that every day,"" she said. It was a fate Hammon escaped with the help of a family she'd been babysitting for outside the compound. About a year after her father died, she asked them if she could stay and they agreed. Hammon says her mother didn't believe she could stop her. Almost two decades later, the memories of her childhood haunt her. Hammon said she doesn't date much. ""I watched my mom just die emotionally and I relate that to marriage,"" she said. Still, she doesn't entirely blame Jeffs for what she went through inside the FLDS community. ""I think that Warren Jeffs is the fall guy for something that has been going on for generations,"" Hammon said. ""Warren Jeffs is just a person to focus on. This system is a well-oiled machine, there's always going to be somebody to step up and take his place. What he has done is terrible... but I know a lot of other men who were out there and in charge who did some pretty terrible things too. Nobody was paying attention then,"" she said. Jeffs was captured August 28, 2006, in a traffic stop near Las Vegas, Nevada. At the time, he had been on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List for months. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Repeat after me: ""Flower sir?"" Now say it again -- 341 times. Virginia Cherrill must have been on the verge of tears after director and actor Charlie Chaplin made her perform one scene -- in which she says just two words in a silent film -- an excruciating 342 times. To be fair to Cherrill, she was not a professional actress, but a 20-year-old socialite Chaplin had spotted in the crowd at a boxing match. The comedic legend, who defined the silent era with his trademark bowler hat, shuffling gait, and toothbrush mustache, hadn't even spoken to Cherrill when he hired her as the love interest in one of his most successful movies of all time -- 1931's ""City Lights."" ""Chaplin was a perfectionist, the king of the re-take,"" said Hooman Mehran, historian and author of ""Chaplin's Limelight and the Music Hall Tradition."" ""This was just a three minute sequence in the finished film,"" he added. ""But he took her to task -- even though it was a silent film."" Now for the first time we can see the making of the memorable scene -- in which blind flower girl Cherrill mistakes Chaplin the tramp for a wealthy man -- in rare behind-the-scenes footage released by film archive the Criterion Collection. Watch the scene here . Practice makes perfect . It's a remarkable insight into the Oscar-winning comedian's work ethic, perhaps better known for his iconic role as the loveable ""Tramp,"" than director. ""He was a one man show -- not only was he the director, he was the writer, he was the producer. When music came in, he was a composer too,"" said Mehran, who narrates the flickering black-and-white footage. In a career spanning 75 years -- from Victorian England to 1950s Hollywood -- Chaplin became one of the most recognizable screen stars in the world, negotiating a $670,000 film deal when he was just 26, a phenomenal amount at the time. It was not uncommon for Chaplin to re-do one scene 10 or 20 times. But 342? ""This was extraordinary even by his standards,"" said Mehran. Why so many attempts at such a seemingly simple scene? ""Chaplin rehearsed on film -- he'd try out an idea and do it over and over again,"" explained Mehran. ""And since he was the director, he couldn't see his performance so he had to record it."" At the time, sound had also started to come into movies, and Chaplin worried ""City Lights"" would be his last silent film -- he wanted to make it a masterpiece. As producer, he invested all his own money into the film -- had it been a flop, it could have destroyed him. Luckily, it turned out to be a box office success. Rags to riches . Growing up in an impoverished London home -- his mother was committed to a mental asylum, his alcoholic father died from liver failure -- Chaplin spent his early years in orphanages. ""He identifies his mother as his greatest influence,"" said Mehran. ""As a child, they would sit in their apartment and she would mimic all the people who were walking down the street. ""It's no coincidence that ""City Lights"" is about a blind woman -- a lot of Chaplin's heroines have a physical disability, which comes back to his mother."" Cut! After joining various theatre troupes as a teenager, Chaplin was taken on by the prestigious Fred Karno comedy company. He toured America, gaining the attention of Keystone Studios -- and launching his career on the big screen. He became the master of physical comedy, with his exaggerated facial expressions, silly walks, and bumbling demeanor influencing generations of slapstick artists; from Abbott and Costello to Lucille Ball, and Mr Bean. Yet despite his blundering on-screen persona, Chaplin was also disciplined director. Watch this: Meet the world's greatest clown . ""He was very tough on set,"" said Mehran. ""He knew exactly what he wanted and he would have preferred not to have any other actors in his films -- he even tried making a film once where he was the only person in it."" It was a style Marlon Brando apparently struggled with on the set of Chaplin's 1967 film ""A Countess from Hong Kong."" ""Brando was a method actor and really wanted to understand what his character was feeling. He said to Chaplin: 'I don't understand my character's motivation in this scene,' and Chaplin said: 'Forget about motivation, just do it as I tell you to do it, that's your motivation,'"" said Mehran. Time capsule . After leaving the U.S. in the 1950s and moving to Switzerland with wife Oona O'Neill -- the couple remained married until his death in 1977 and had eight children -- Chaplin ordered many of his outtakes to be destroyed. ""We're very lucky to have this ""City Lights"" footage,"" said Mehran. ""It was shot by his friend Ralph Barton, who committed suicide not long after, and certainly Chaplin would not let anyone else, other than his brother, film on set."" For a legend of silent cinema, Chaplin's actions spoke louder than words.","New behind-the-scenes footage reveals Chaplin's demanding directing style .

"Ryan O'Neal, a junior at Arizona State University, is a columnist for Scoop08.com, a national student newspaper dedicated to coverage of the 2008 presidential race. CNNU is a feature that provides student perspectives on news and trends from colleges across the United States. The views expressed in this article are not necessarily those of CNN, its affiliates or the schools where the campus correspondents are based. Ryan O'Neal: ""I couldn't help but be suspicious of everything and everyone."" TEMPE, Arizona (CNN) -- College students are faced with many challenges each day. It's tough to balance a job with hours of homework, and to pay attention in class while planning an escape route from a lecture hall seat. As I sat in class following the Virginia Tech shootings a year ago, I couldn't help but be suspicious of everything and everyone. It's not that I thought someone was going to walk into my particular classroom and start unloading -- I realize the chances of this happening are about as small as my chances of retiring by age 30 -- but the events pushed my mind into ""what if"" mode. Going to school on a large campus can be scary at times -- especially for incoming freshmen who are used to high school classes with less than 30 students -- but never more so than the days following tragedy. The fear doesn't necessarily stem from the notion that danger is imminent, but rather from the idea that you don't know who people really are and what they are capable of, or how you would react to straits so dire. The collective picture of the perpetrators is not an encouraging one, and rightfully so. The images of students banding together at memorials and vigils get locked in your mind. And after all the fear and frustration and anger and hopelessness dissipate, all we've got is the future, where we ask, ""How do we prevent this?"" Of course, to know the accurate prevention measures, we have to know the cause. Though everything from violence in media to Goth culture have been examined, there is only one major link behind the motives of the shooters of past school shootings: mental instability. Looking back, everything from the Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois University incidents of the past year to the University of Texas clock tower and Cal State Fullerton Library massacres of 1966 and 1976, respectively, have had killers who had previously been receiving psychological treatment. In the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre in Montreal, Quebec, the psychological and psychiatric profile of the killer contained in the coroner's report said, ""The multiple homicide/suicide strategy is ... known to be a characteristic of individuals who have a serious personality disorder."" Perpetrators of violent massacres do not think rationally, and if they are social isolationists who don't have a close support group, prevention via medication and therapy can only be successful in stopping the relatively tame. Trying to ensure nonviolence on this micro level is like trying to eliminate interethnic combat on the macro level. Not gonna happen. So we focus on our safety. What do we do to protect ourselves? I know... Let's talk about gun control! With the increase in both violence and the attention paid to it with respect to college campuses, gun rights have been a topic that's been under much discussion. Fantasies of vigilante justice fuel some students' desires to carry a concealed weapon to class. Currently, only Utah allows students to carry guns on campus. Even Texas has explicit bans. Three years ago, a Virginia Tech student was reprimanded for carrying, and ensuing legislation to allow concealed weapons on colleges faltered before reaching the floor of the state Congress. With this knowledge, one wonders if, had decisions been made differently, there is a small possibility there would have been less than 32 balloons released at Virginia Tech's first home football game. On the contrary, guns shouldn't need to be allowed on campus. After all, dorm rooms -- where many a party takes place -- are hardly the ideal setting for a gun to be readily available, and the frequency of school shootings is not high enough to convince many Americans that the rewards outweigh the risks. Unfortunately, it is high enough that all campus and city police departments need to have measures in place for such emergencies. In September 2006, Montreal's Dawson College learned response lessons from the aforementioned École Polytechnique episode. Instead of police waiting until the SWAT team arrived, they took immediate action, and only one student was murdered. Arizona schools have begun purchasing long-range rifles for use in similar situations, and many other schools are re-evaluating their emergency-response procedures, but even those don't guarantee safety. It takes a collaborative effort to keep us safe, but the burden should not be placed entirely on the students or the institution. Legislation needs to continue to be passed to help keep weapons from those who are dangerous to us, while preserving our individual rights, and we as concerned Americans need to encourage discussion of these matters within our congresses. Colleges and universities are a place of wisdom and expansion. Fear and bullets surely seem the antithesis. E-mail to a friend . (c) 2008 Scoop Media, Inc.

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton's assertion this week she and her husband left the White House ""dead broke"" left some Americans scratching their heads. How, they wondered, could a family making six-figures, living rent free, and writing best-sellers possibly run out of cash? As it turns out, being President doesn't necessarily come cheap. While first families don't have to pay rent at the White House, they are responsible for personal costs that can multiply, especially if they spend the full eight years in that spotlight. Former first lady Laura Bush wrote in her post-White House memoir that she was expected to pick up the tab for every meal she ate at the White House or the presidential Camp David retreat -- for her husband's two terms. ""The presidential room, as it were, is covered, but not the board,"" she wrote in her book, ""Spoken from the Heart."" While first families aren't responsible for utility bills or a mortgage, ""it is more than fair that they pay for personal items like every American household."" So traumatized was Laura Bush by the constant attention to her predecessors hair that she hired a stylist to give her a blow dry daily -- at her own expense. Bush wrote that a bill came monthly, itemizing everything she and her family owed, including food, dry cleaning and hourly wages for waiters and cleanup crews at private parties. ""There were some costs that I was not prepared for,"" Bush wrote. ""I was amazed by the sheer number of designer clothes that I was expected to buy, like the women before me, to meet the expectations for a first lady."" 'Hard Choices': A book rollout or a campaign tune up? The Clintons wouldn't be the first presidential couple to emerge from the White House in debt. When he left office in 1825, James Monroe was deeply in debt. It wasn't just dinner parties and designer dresses weighing down the Clintons financially. Enormous legal fees followed them after their departure in January 2001. By the end of the previous year, the Clintons carried debt totaling somewhere between $2.28 million to $10.6 million. But the red ink was taken care of pretty quickly. They both signed big book advances, and the former president raked in millions giving speeches. Clinton tax return . By 2004 the Clintons had paid off all their legal fees. It wasn't just speaking engagements boosting the Clinton's income. When a President leaves the White House he's still on the government payroll, receiving an annual pension of about $200,000, health care, paid official travel and an office. Hillary Clinton Senate disclosure form . Rent for President Jimmy Carter's Atlanta office is $102,000 per year, according to 2010 figures compiled by the Congressional Research Service. President George H. W. Bush's Houston office costs $175,000 per year. President Bill Clinton's office in the pricey real estate market of New York City is $516,000. He currently gets about $750,000 per speech. What's not in Hillary Clinton's memoir?","Hillary Clinton's ""dead broke"" comment touched a nerve .

It's not on pristine Guadeloupe -- a five-island overseas region of France located in the Leeward Islands -- but the era of relative obscurity there may be coming to an end. First the pristine part. With modern infrastructure and top-notch cuisine, Guadeloupe is a 629-square-mile treasure of near-empty beaches, forests, waterfalls, cliffs and healthy coral reefs. Fresh conch kebabs, seaside bars, gwo ka drummers playing and chanting against the sound of lapping waves -- how this cluster of islands has remained off-the-beaten path for so long is a mystery for out of work travel agents to contemplate. That may change. Soon. Historically, a stronghold of French tourists, Guadeloupe is vying to become the next big winter escape for North Americans, launching formal marketing efforts aimed at those tourists just last year. In April 2013, American Airlines and Seaborne Airlines launched weekly, direct flights from Miami and Puerto Rico to the main city of Pointe-à-Pitre (population 132,884). JetBlue followed in November, signing an interline agreement with Seaborne. By the close of 2013, Guadeloupe Islands' Tourist Board reported a 22.5% annual increase in visitors from the United States. According to the Caribbean Journal, Guadeloupe received just 420,000 visitors overall in 2013.

"(CNN) -- Bob McDonald, President Barack Obama's pick to head the troubled Department of Veterans Affairs, has been in the hot seat before. That's when he led global consumer products giant Procter & Gamble in the throes of the Great Recession, gaining praise and criticism for aggressive management before being replaced by the board. Now, if confirmed by the Senate, he must leverage his military and corporate credentials to at least begin restructuring a sprawling agency the Obama administration now concludes has serious problems delivering adequate health care mainly due to ineffective leadership. P&G . McDonald attended West Point and served a stint in the Army before earning an MBA from the University of Utah. He worked his way up the ranks of P&G over three decades before landing the top job. There, his role was to restructure and streamline the conglomerate with 120,000 employees, 25 brands and $1 billion in revenue. Its diverse and recognizable brand lineup included Bounty paper towels, Duracell batteries, Pampers diapers and Tide detergent. His bio says his leadership strategically improved performance and that the company's stock rose 60% during his four-year tenure. By the time McDonald landed in the top ""C-suite"" job, his prescription was to shrink the company. His plan was to save about $10 billion over four years, including significant marketing cuts and a 10% workforce reduction. He was rewarded with a $15.9 million salary during 2013, his last year. Ultimately, he was ousted with critics arguing the company wasn't moving fast enough to improve efficiency. Chief among them was hedge fund investor Bill Ackman, who contended McDonald served on the boards of too many other organizations to focus properly on P&G's needs. The company said Ackman's claims were overstated. Despite the investor controversy, P&G won several awards under McDonald's tenure. It was twice named best company for leaders by Chief Executive Magazine, and ranked first among over 2,000 companies in a leadership study by the management consultants at Hay Group. Military credentials . McDonald also served five years in the Army, rising to captain following his military academy training. He has maintained close ties to West Point, establishing a conference to teach leadership skills. But McDonald's relatively light military experience is concerning to some veterans groups. Paul Rieckhoff, President of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, called Obama's choice ""surprising."" ""He's been away from the military for quite a while, and will have to move quickly to show he is committed to and understands the post-9/11 generation of veterans,"" he added. By contrast, his predecessor, Eric Shinseki, had been an Army general. Shinseki resigned under pressure in May with the VA engulfed in searing controversy over delayed care with deadly results, allegations of coverup, and revelations of severe management shortcomings. Political savvy . While a businessman, McDonald has been familiar with the ways of Washington. He was appointed by President George W. Bush and reappointed by Obama to be a member of the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy. He has also engaged in the political process with campaign contributions totaling $30,000 made exclusively to Republicans. Half of that went to Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign and political action committee, according to Federal Election Commission records. Not long after that news emerged, House Speaker John Boehner praised McDonald, calling him ""a good man, a veteran, and a strong leader."" ""With those traits, he's the kind of person who is capable of implementing the kind of dramatic systemic change that is badly needed and long overdue at the VA,"" Boehner said. McDonald has contributed to Boehner's coffers as well. McDonald currently serves on the board of the Xerox Corporation as well as U.S. Steel and several advisory groups. If confirmed, McDonald will take over an agency still under investigation by the VA inspector general and the FBI. The VA provides medical care and other services to more than 8 million veterans.

"(CNN) -- For those on a quest to visit all 50 United States, each one is like a jagged piece of a very large jigsaw puzzle. Fitting in all 50 states is an impressive achievement. In fact, anyone who knocks 35 off the list is eligible for membership in the exclusive All Fifty Club, an organization that recognizes individuals who make it to every state with a plaque or certificate to commemorate their accomplishment. To ""visit"" a state, a person has to step outside the airport and breathe the air, according to the organization's website. Airport layovers mean nothing. Those who are truly passionate about making it to all 50 states often have their own criteria for crossing them off the list, from a hard-core requirement of staying in a state for more than a month to simply hopping out of the car to snap a picture at the border. American odyssey: 50 states in 31 years . CNN asked avid 50-staters to run down their requirements. Here's how it's done: . Go beyond the border . Back in 1976, Don Carswell of New Jersey, now 53, and his friend Tom White made a bet to see who would be the first one to set foot in all 50 states. At stake was a six-pack of beer. In order to count a state as ""visited,"" the two men agreed that they had to spend at least one full hour in a state during the day, be outdoors at least part of the time, set foot on the actual ground, and go beyond the state's border. Airport property also didn't count. The bet lasted 15 years, until Carswell received a postcard from White declaring he had reached his 50th state. Carswell was still two states shy of completing his goal, making sure he followed the criteria they set when they first made the bet. It took seven more years for Carswell to visit Oregon, the one state he needed. ""Being one state shy annoyed me. I needed to take matters into my own hands,"" he said. Sent to San Francisco on business in 1998, he extended his stay to rent a car and drive north to Oregon. ""I was sure to send Tom a card,"" Carswell recalled. It simply said, '50!' "" 50 states, 50 spots to visit in 2014 . Let the kids choose . Together the Holmes family of Pennsylvania has traveled to 40 states. Their oldest child, Cate, is barely a teenager. Wendy Holmes says that she and her husband, Chris, have been taking their 13-year-old daughter Cate and 7-year-old son Tom on trips since they were infants. Once Cate and Tom were old enough, Holmes and her husband started letting them take turns deciding where the family would go each year. Because the family often drives to their destinations, they try to stop in as many states as they can in one trip. ""We're not competitive,"" Holmes said, but they are strategic. ""We do have plans on which states to visit over the next few years so that we do hit 50 before our daughter leaves for college."" Holmes keeps track of the states they've seen in an Excel spreadsheet, using the list to plan what stops they'll make on future trips. ""We drive so much on our vacations and camp a lot. We've actually gotten out and seen the states."" The family typically stays in each state they visit for three days, but apart from how long they stay, there's really only one other agreed-upon criterion. ""My husband has (visited) 46 states. He's not allowed to get to 50 unless we're all together."" Go back to fill in the blanks . Justin Clark Pollard had a deadline to meet. He and his wife, Dana, had been taking long road trips during their summers off from teaching since 2009. It wasn't until their second big road trip in 2012 that they saw how close they were to visiting all 50 states, and they decided to go for it. But Pollard wanted to push this goal even further. The deadline: His 30th birthday. ""I used (turning) 30 as a reason to do this, to keep traveling places I might not go otherwise,"" he said. On an old road atlas he keeps in the glove compartment of a baby blue Nissan, Pollard kept track of all the states he and his wife visited. At the bare minimum, he considers getting a snapshot at a state's border beneath the welcome sign enough to circle it on his map. But on average he and his wife try to stay in each state at least two days. They even took seasonal jobs at Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska for seven weeks so they would have the opportunity to really witness its wildlife. When they got back home to Georgia after their Alaska trip, Pollard's deadline was fast approaching. With only three weeks until he turned 30, the couple packed up and raced to hit the two states they had yet to see: Michigan and Wisconsin. Despite their short stay in each state, Pollard was not disappointed. ""No matter how much time I stay in a state, I'm never going to see the whole thing,"" he said. These road trips are ""highlight trips."" Now that he and his wife have seen all 50 states, they're able to stay in one place a little longer. ""On the road trips we saw what all the states were known for, and now we can go back and explore them in depth."" Connect with people . Long-time friends Kristin Sweetman and Katie Stern, both 29, have put their lives on hold to embark on a seven-month journey across the country, volunteering in each state they visit. ""We were both at points where we needed direction in our lives. We were both in ruts and needed a change to do something else,"" said Sweetman, who quit her job before leaving on this trip. Since the two women started on their journey from their homes in Minnesota on April 28, they have already picked up nine states. They have been staying in each state for anywhere from three to five days, devoting one full day to volunteering and staying at campsites or with other volunteers they work with. In West Virginia, the women worked in a community garden with Conscious Harvest Cooperative, a group of West Virginia University students and Morgantown residents who grow food for local pantries. In the Adirondacks in upstate New York, they found a local farmer and helped him grow tomatoes. Next, they're volunteering in Boston with Hope Lodge, baking snacks for the families of cancer patients. They're journaling and blogging about their experiences in each state, and they use a calendar to keep themselves organized and on track. But they're really in no rush to finish their journey across the country. They want to live in the moment and see where it takes them, Sweetman says. ""We want to connect with the different people we meet on this trip,"" Sweetman said. ""There are so many people who have opened their homes and their hearts to us, and that's how we get a true idea of what a place is really like.""","Visiting all 50 states is an impressive achievement that is celebrated by the All Fifty Club .

"(CNN) -- An explosion at a subway station in Santiago, Chile, injured 14 people Monday, authorities said Tuesday. The explosion happened around 2 p.m. at the Escuela Militar station in the upper- class neighborhood of Las Condes, said Mario Rozas, spokesman for the Chilean National Police. Most of the injured were in a restaurant at the metro station. The victims suffered ""sound trauma, three had cuts, one had an exposed fracture and another one had a traumatic amputation of fingers."" The victims were from 30 to 65 years old. CNN Chile reported the explosive device was inside a trash bin in an open area at the metro station. Subway service has continued operating, but trains are not stopping at the station while police and emergency services work. The station where the explosion occurred is used daily by about 150,000 commuters. Alvaro Elizalde, a top government spokesman, called the bombing ""an act of terrorism"" and said the government will invoke the antiterrorism law. ""Innocent people have been affected by this reprehensible act that deserves a decisive response. All Chileans should be united in this. The government is coordinating efforts to determine who the perpetrators (are) so that they're brought to justice,"" Elizalde said. So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the bombing. Several explosions have been set off in the Chilean capital in the past few months. Some bombings happened at banks in the middle of the night, and authorities said the motive was robbery. In July, an explosive device left inside a subway car detonated at the Los Dominicos station, but the explosion happened at the end of the day as the train was finishing its route. The car was empty, and no one was injured. This is the first time an explosion has been set off in a public place during the day.","NEW: 14 injured, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- It's like a stunt from the latest James Bond movie, only this isn't a movie. Adorned in a designer suit and sunglasses, a sailor sprints up the 30-meter mast of a boat as it plows ahead at a 60-degree angle. Hopping over ropes and rigging it takes him just 16 seconds to reach the mast's peak. There, he checks himself, removes his sunglasses, pops them in his top pocket and dives into the ocean nine meters below him. ""It's the most stupid thing I've ever done,"" is  Alex Thomson's frank assessment of his stunt. ""It wasn't safe at all,"" adds the yachtsman more used to solo circumnavigating the globe. ""Only looking back do I really appreciate how dangerous it actually was."" The stunt was carried out without a harness, just a water resistant suit, although the risk was reduced thanks to the work of a stunt co-ordinator and two days of preparation on the water. For Thomson's daredevil performance to succeed he also needed a wind speed of exactly 18 to 20 knots and for the boat to be traveling at 10 knots (a little under 20 kph). The 37-year-old and his team began their search for the perfect wind speed in Palma, Mallorca, but were forced to switch to Tarifa in southern Spain because conditions weren't right before eventually shifting to Cadiz where the stunt was eventually performed. ""At the end of the first day, I had to sit down on shore and calm down,"" says Thomson. ""I was appreciating perhaps it wasn't safe at all, and there were some hairy moments when we were practicing. I remember one time I was halfway up when the boat suddenly tacked and I was just left hanging from the mast. ""Obviously falling from that height from the mast onto the deck isn't advisable,"" he quips. ""The ramifications wouldn't have been great."" On the day itself, with stunning skies above, the stunt went pretty much perfectly, which had a lot to do with the man driving the boat, Ross Daniel. ""His was the harder, more nerve wracking job as he had to keep the boat just right,"" says Thomson. ""Ross works for me and he's a good mate so obviously he was conscious he didn't want things to go wrong. ""I'm not sure if he was relieved come the end of it but he was certainly happy man with how it went."" As for Thomson's starring role in the escapade, he's conscious that he came very close to really hurting himself. ""Now the top of a mast isn't really designed for a man to dive off but I went for it and it held up,"" says the yachtsman. ""As for the dive itself, I slightly over-egged. There was some quite impressive editing work on that as I landed head first very close to my back. ""It was quite close to a back belly flop and, while I wouldn't have killed myself, I certainly would have had some nasty internal injuries. ""Diving wise, I'd always wanted to dive but wasn't sure until I got to the top whether I'd have the guts to do it. ""I'd been up a 10-meter board at a pool in training but never dived off it. So this was a first and, once I was up there, I sort of thought I might as well go for it."" As he pondered that stomach-churning dive, Thomson says he felt surprisingly calm. ""As a sailor I'm used to hoisting myself up the mast and you get well versed at reading the wind and the waves so I was quite aware if there was suddenly going to be a change in the boat's course,"" he explains. There wasn't, he duly hit the water and quickly returned to the surface to the relief and cheers of his team. Even now, Thomson, who has a penchant for being something of a daredevil, is not entirely sure why he performed the stunt. ""I did a keel walk a while ago and we did a video for that, which got over two million people watching which I was flabbergasted by,"" he admits. ""So we got talking about doing something else and this seemed a bit of fun really. ""I'd taken to running up the mast -- although not necessarily to the top -- for a while, mostly when entertaining people on the boat to, say, take pictures of them on the deck. ""So, going the whole way up and jumping off seemed a good idea. ""It's a bit like the Vendee Globe (the race to circumnavigate the globe). You sort of agree to it not thinking it will necessarily happen, and then suddenly the day comes for it."" Having done a keel walk two years ago and now a mast walk, Thomson is at a loss to consider what might complete a hat-trick of sailing stunts. ""That was the same after the keel walk. I'd never planned to follow that or do something like this, it just happened. So when I'm asked what I might do next, I literally have no idea.""","Sailor takes on death-defying stunt of charging to the top of his boat's mast and diving off .

"(CNN) -- Military spouse Michelle Aikman has lived through five moves with her husband and their two young children. Currently living at Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane, Washington, she has made each new town ""home"" for her family while her husband has served overseas during 13 deployments. The moving boxes, the unfamiliar surroundings, the new schools, teachers and friends -- all are the norm for Aikman, her family, and thousands of military families across the nation. And so are the challenges facing military spouses like Aikman, who also pursue their own careers. In honor of Military Family Appreciation Month and the homage we pay to our veterans this week, we would like to offer tribute to America's service members, their families and the myriad sacrifices they make for this country. The challenges they face are tremendous, which is why we are advancing solutions in the United States Congress to make life better for service members and their families. Five years ago, as friends and colleagues, we reached across the aisle and joined to form the bipartisan Congressional Military Family Caucus. Its mission is to advocate for military families like Aikman's and draw attention to the challenges they face every day. Over the years, the caucus, which has over 40 members, has reached out to the entire House of Representatives to address such issues as education, health care, combating stress from multiple deployments, mental health, and military spouse employment. We also educate military families on available resources and promote related legislation before the Congress. Our caucus membership hails from coast to coast, and crosses political boundaries as well. Additionally, a corresponding Military Family Caucus has been formed in the Senate. Together, we work with first lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden's ""Joining Forces"" project, as well as interface with numerous service organizations like the National Military Family Association, Blue Star Families, the Military Officer Association of America, the Wounded Warrior Project, and the Military Child Education Coalition to successfully support military families. Both of us have personal experiences with military families. One of us married the daughter of a 20-year career U.S. Army veteran, and one of us married a retired 26-year career U.S. Navy officer. Both our families have a deep understanding and connection to the struggles facing spouses and children coping with continual deployments and rotations. Through living these experiences and hearing their stories, we have garnered a deep appreciation for the tremendous responsibilities that military families like Aikman's take on every single day. Aikman knew that life as a military spouse would bring its own unique set of challenges. She did not realize, however, that finding a specialized job in her profession would be nearly impossible as her family moved across the country. Trained as an engineer, Aikman needed state-specific licensing in order to qualify for many positions -- meaning each time she moved, she needed to meet each state's experience standards. Eventually Aikman made the difficult decision to change career paths to provide for her family, and now works as a career consultant and draws attention to how difficult it can be for military spouses to find employment. Aikman's challenge is not unique to her. Half of working military spouses need licensing or certification for their employment. Since almost 80% of military families have moved across state lines at least once in the past five years, it's no wonder military spouses have some of the highest unemployment rates in the country. In Congress, we are working to better understand the trials military spouses like Aikman face. We recently offered an amendment to evaluate the Military Spouse Employment Program's progress in helping military spouses find jobs, which passed through the House this May. It is vital to better understand how the program is being used, who is using it and whether the jobs obtained match applicants' skill sets, education and experience, to address unemployment and underemployment for our military spouses. In a political environment often stuck in gridlock, it is not often that you hear of Democrats and Republicans working together -- yet every year we host a Military Family Summit where we hear directly from military families in order to better understand their challenges. We also connect them with local employers, health care providers, support leaders and advocates. We listen, and we learn. We bring their voices back to Washington and share their stories with our colleagues. These families have given so much and have gone through more than most of us can imagine, and so this Military Family Appreciation Month -- and every month -- we will be doing all that we can to stand behind them and honor their sacrifices, so they may in turn continue to keep America strong.

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal safety board called Tuesday for a nationwide ban on the use of cell phones and text messaging devices while driving. The recommendation is the most far-reaching yet by the National Transportation Safety Board, which in the past 10 years has increasingly sought to limit the use of portable electronic devices -- recommending bans for novice drivers, school bus drivers and commercial truckers. Tuesday's recommendation, if adopted by states, would outlaw non-emergency phone calls and texting by operators of every vehicle on the road. It would apply to hands-free as well as hand-held devices, but devices installed in the vehicle by the manufacturer would be allowed, the NTSB said. The recommendation would not affect passengers' rights to use such devices. Study: Distracted drivers in denial . NTSB members say the action is necessary to combat a growing threat posed by distracted drivers. While distracted driving has been a problem ""since the Model T,"" in the words of NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman, authorities say it has become ubiquitous with the explosion in the number of portable smart phones. At any given daylight moment, some 13.5 million drivers are on hand-held phones, according to a study released last week by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Some 3,092 roadway fatalities last year involved distracted drivers, although the actual number may be far higher, NHTSA said. ""This (distracted driving) is becoming the new DUI. It's becoming epidemic,"" said NTSB member Robert Sumwalt. Accident investigators routinely seek protective orders to preserve smart phones for use as evidence in accident investigations, Hersman said. But because distracted drivers sometimes do not own up to their actions, or because they die during the crash, determining whether distraction was a factor in an accident can be difficult. That was the case in a 2010 chain-reaction accident near Gray Summit, Missouri. During the 11 minutes prior to that incident, the driver of a pickup truck received five text messages, and sent six, and he was seen leaning over just before the accident, leading investigators to believe the driver was likely distracted when his truck plowed at 55 mph into the rear of a tractor trailer, which had slowed or stopped because of a highway work zone. Two school buses then plowed into the wreckage. Two people -- including the pickup truck driver and a bus occupant -- were killed; 38 other people were injured. The driver of the pickup truck was 19 years old, and was in violation of a Missouri law prohibiting drivers under the age of 21 from texting while driving. But the safety board focused little on the age of the driver, casting ""distracted driving"" as epidemic among people of all ages. Time: How dangerous is it, really? The NTSB said cell phone laws alone would not solve the problem, but must be accompanied by aggressive educational campaigns and strict enforcement. The Missouri State Highway Patrol had issued only 120 citations for texting in a two-year-period, the NTSB said. Currently, a patchwork of laws governs cell-phone usage by drivers. Some 35 states ban text messaging while driving, 30 states ban cell-phone use by novice drivers, and 10 ban all use of hand-held cell phones, according to the NTSB. The safety board also recommended the electronics industry develop phones that would discourage their use by drivers, but could identify a car occupant's location so that passengers could use the devices. A Virginia Tech Transportation Institute study of commercial drivers found that a safety-critical event is 163 times more likely if a driver is texting, e-mailing or accessing the Internet. The NTSB's action is a recommendation only, but the board has been instrumental in leading for changes in other areas of transportation safety. Chairwoman Hersman said the ban may inconvenience motorists, but would save lives. ""Needless lives are lost on our highways, and for what? Convenience? Death isn't convenient,"" Hersman said. ""So we can stay more connected? A fatal accident severs that connection."" The NTSB's investigation of the August 5, 2010, Missouri crash also exposed numerous other safety shortcomings. Although Missouri requires school bus inspections twice a year -- one by the highway patrol and a second by a certified inspection station -- an inspection 10 days before the accident did not reveal faulty brakes on one of the buses, the NTSB said. The faulty brakes were not a factor in the accident, the NTSB said, because the driver said she did not hit the brakes before the crash. But the NTSB criticized the service station that inspected the brakes, the contract owner of the school buses, and the highway patrol. The highway patrol gave the bus company a ""Total Fleet Maintenance Award"" before the accident because 100% of its buses had passed inspection. In an unannounced inspection following the tragedy, the pass rate dropped to 60%, the NTSB said. The NTSB said both the inspection station and the highway patrol performed inadequate inspections.

"(CNN) -- For several months in 2003, I did the whole European backpacker thing. Which is to say I've seen nearly every cathedral within 1,000 square miles of the Danube. ""Are we cultured yet?"" ""Shut up. Two more."" It also means that I have an old journal filled out in the back with countless e-mail addresses from travelers I'll probably never see again. This was before the heyday of social media, back when pretending to care about people you just met required considerably less effort. Because now when you go abroad, you actually have to connect with your fellow travelers over Facebook. And then deny their Candy Crush requests. Well, these casual travel friendships are about to go completely bonkers over the next two weekends as the world-famous Tomorrowland festival kicks off in Belgium. I'll get to why in a moment, but for those of you who are unfamiliar with Tomorrowland, it's a multiday gathering of thousands upon thousands of beautiful young people from all over the planet, congregating in a fairytale-themed field, dancing all night to DJs playing EDM. (Note to Dad: EDM stands for Electronic Dance Music. It sounds nothing like Willie Nelson. Just put on the Golf Channel and stay away from Belgium.) That said, if you're not my dad and actually enjoy EDM, it's probably a great time. Especially if you're into that whole being young and enjoying life thing. I'd go, but my iCal has me scheduled to wallow in self-doubt. (The following weekend is also completely booked with some pre-planned lower back pain.) However, if you do make it over to Belgium, this year you'll be wearing a special festival bracelet that allows you to instantly send friend requests to people you just met. ""YOU get a friend request. YOU get a friend request. YOU get a friend request. EVERYBODY GETS A FRIEND REQUEST!"" Now, because this festival is so delightfully wackadoo, these bracelets literally arrive at your door in a Tomorrowland treasure case, which, from what I've seen online, is far more ornate than anything I currently have in my house. No offense, IKEA. You see, this festival tends to go all-in on the ridiculous. And I like that. They've made it fun before you even get there. An instructional Web video from Tomorrowland explains that, once your treasure case arrives in the mail, you have to use a ""magical key"" to ""unlock the happiness."" Then, inside the box, you'll find your bracelet, for which you have to go online to activate with a personalized code. Next, to ""fully unleash all its magical power,"" you connect it to your Facebook account. And if everything syncs up as it should, the bracelet is then armed for making instant friends. Back in my day, we used cheap bourbon and old war stories. Somehow, I just turned 72. But at Tomorrowland, you and your new pal just need to be near each other while you press your ""heart"" buttons at the same time. The next day, you'll receive a daily ""special friendship"" e-mail with all the contact details of your new late-night besties. ""Who the hell is Gunther?"" ""He's that crazy German guy with no pants. You spent six hours with him building a glow stick castle."" ""Oh, Guuuuunther."" So, who knows what kind of new digital friends you'll suddenly make. The possibilities are endless. You can even play port-a-potty roulette with the person using the stall next to yours. ""I don't know who you are over there, or what you just ate, but ... One. Two. Three. Go!"" What's also cool is that the bracelet is actually your entrance pass to the festival. There's no paper. And that's sort of the new trend in ticketing: high-tech smart bracelets. In fact, this year, Lollapalooza in Chicago is going cashless by using radio frequency identification-enabled wristband tickets that also allow festival-goers to make payments. The bracelets are linked to the user's credit card. Which, after far too many beers, probably sounds like this: . ""I'll take a poster. And a t-shirt. And a coozie. And another poster. And another t-shirt for that guy. And whatever this chick wants. And let's do another poster."" What could possibly go wrong? Anyway, things have certainly changed since I promised to keep in touch with all those people I met back in Europe. But this is just life as we know it in our crazy modern world. Embrace it.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN)  -- An eerie silence hangs over Havana's main sea-front avenue as smoke drifts out of a lone abandoned car. Suddenly, dozens of bloodied figures lurch into view, some with empty eye sockets, others dragging limbs behind them. It's another day on location for ""Juan of the Dead,"" Cuba's first zombie movie, a mix of camp gore and wry satire. In this version, the communist government blames the zombie invasion on U.S.-backed dissidents intent on destabilizing the country. The hero Juan is an unemployed loafer who sees a chance to make a buck. For a price, he and his partner will eliminate your possessed loved ones for you. The writer-director calls it a zombie comedy, but also a very Cuban movie. ""We always do the same thing in the face of trouble,"" Alejandro Brugues told CNN. ""First we try to make some money out of it. Then we try to leave the country. And that's what our heroes do throughout the film."" When the living dead overrun the city, Juan and his partner convert their car into a raft and must decide whether to flee Miami, Florida,­ recalling a real-life incident in 2004 when would-be Cuban migrants hit the Florida straits in a floating 1959 Buick. The film also gently pokes fun at the island's political rhetoric. The pre-production teaser promises: ""Fifty years after the triumph of the Revolution, a new revolution is about to begin."" It also features pictures of its hero Juan alongside Cuba's independence fighters and the likes of Che Guevara. It is the second film for 34-year-old Brugues and his young partners, who created their own production company called ""5a Avenida""  or ""5th Avenue."" ""For four years we were the only ones who believed in our project,"" says co-producer Inti Herrera. ""All of sudden you have a hundred people on the set and all these collaborators."" They got the backing of Cuba's official Film Institute and also signed up Spain's La Zanfona Producciones. And they cobbled together a $2.3 million budget, big by Cuban standards, mostly to finance special effects, which will be added in post-production. ""I think in some ways, it makes sense that this whole idea was launched by a group of young people,"" said another co-producer Claudia Calvino, 27. ""We aren't afraid, so we just jump right in and keep pushing until things get done."" On location, ""Juan of the Dead"" is a mixture of sophisticated filmmaking equipment, much of it from Spain, and low-tech Cuban know-how. When producers ran into problems getting permission to use a boat to film some water scenes, they set their cameras up on Styrofoam rafts borrowed from local fishermen. And when it came to making the zombie-mobile, they did what so many Cubans do: They found an old 1950s American car rotting in a garage and tinkered until it was road-ready. ""It's been fun so far,"" says Brugues. ""In reality, I don't want it to end."" The movie will be ready to hit theaters next year, but filmmakers are hoping to secure a coveted spot at one of the prestigious film festivals first.","""Juan of the Dead,"" Cuba's first zombie movie, a mix of camp gore and wry satire .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- The commander of Mexico City's investigative police force was shot and killed Friday morning as he left his home, authorities said. The death of Esteban Robles Espinosa comes a day after Mexico's federal police chief was shot dead in a northwestern Mexico City neighborhood. Robles headed Mexico City's anti-kidnapping unit until 2003, according to the city's judicial police. He was also on the internal affairs commission, the department said. A group of armed men approached Robles as he was leaving his house about 8:30 a.m., authorities said. He was shot eight times and died shortly after he arrived at a hospital, they said. Robles had not received any death threats, the judicial police department said. The federal police chief, Edgar Eusebio Millan Gomez, was fatally shot around dawn Thursday in a street in Colonia Guerrero in Mexico City, the country's public safety department said. The murders of Robles and Millan -- who played an active role in the Mexican government's fight against drug cartels and organized crime -- are the latest in a string of killings of police and military personnel in Mexico. Only a week ago, Roberto Velasco Bravo, the director of investigation for organized crime, was killed in the capital city. U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Antonio Garza called it a ""brutal assassination."" Many believe that the slayings are retaliation for President Felipe Calderon's crackdown on the country's drug cartels. Since he took office in 2006, Calderon has deployed 24,000 troops to fight the cartels. ""During my management, there have been many soldiers, many marines -- especially federal police -- who have lost their lives fighting to liberate the citizenry from crime,"" Calderon said Friday. ""It is a fight for liberation from the enslavement or the control that [criminals] try to impose via crimes of diverse means."" Responding to Millan's death, the president said, ""the Mexican government will re-enforce its head-on fight against crime."" Calderon condemned Millan's assassination as ""cowardly."" He described Millan as ""an exemplary official committed to the security of Mexican families."" In January, Millan appeared forceful and optimistic when he discussed with CNN en Español the government's campaign against the drug cartels. ""Our fight is head-on,"" he said. ""The capacities of the Mexican state are aligned to break the structures of each cartel."" The violence in Mexico appears to be worst in the north, prompting the U.S. State Department to issue a travel warning for American citizens. ""Recent Mexican army and police force conflicts with heavily armed narcotics cartels have escalated to levels equivalent to military small-unit combat and have included use of machine guns and fragmentation grenades,"" said the warning issued last month. ""Armed robberies and carjackings, apparently unconnected to the narcotics-related violence, have increased in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez,"" it said. The State Department noted that the attacks are ""aimed primarily at members of drug trafficking organizations, Mexican police forces, criminal justice officials and journalists."" ""There is no evidence, however, that U.S. citizens are targeted because of their nationality,"" the warning stated. Calderon touched on the issue Monday, saying, ""Mexico today suffers from an onslaught of crime, and that's one of our greatest enemies. Insecurity threatens the well-being and peace of our families, the health and future of our children and the development of our people."" CNN's Harris Whitbeck contributed to this report.","High-ranking Mexico City police official shot leaving his home; dies at hospital .

"(CNN) -- At first glance, it doesn't seem that remarkable: An old black-and-white scene of a strangely deserted city, smudged in places by some primitive photographic process. But this image, taken in Paris, France, in 1838, is believed to be the earliest known photograph featuring a person. Look in the photo's lower left corner and you'll see a man getting his boots cleaned on the sidewalk. The boot-cleaner is there too, although he is harder to spot. The image has been posted online before, but it gained a higher profile after news site Mashable published a full-page version on Wednesday in partnership with Retronaut, a website that archives photos from the past. It was taken by Louis Daguerre, the French photographer famous for pioneering the daguerreotype, an early type of photo produced on a silver plate or a silver-covered copper plate. According to Retronaut's Amanda Uren, the exposure time for the image was around seven minutes. The street appears deserted because while the two human figures were relatively still, other pedestrians and horse-drawn carriages were moving too fast to register on the plate. The photo shows the Boulevard du Temple, a then-fashionable area of shops, cafÃ©s and theaters. The two people on the sidewalk are the most recognizable human figures in the photo, although Uren points out that a detailed examination reveals other possible people on a bench and in a window of the building in the foreground. The image is not close to being the earliest known surviving photograph, though. That distinction belongs to a photo by Joseph NicÃ©phore NiÃ©pce, one of Daguerre's partners, who used a crude camera to capture the view from a window at his French estate in 1826 or 1827. Today, when almost everyone has a phone camera in their pocket and more than 350 million photos are uploaded to Facebook every day, Daguerre's milestone seems quaint. In 2014, he might have just snapped a selfie.","The earliest known photograph to show a person was published online this week .

"(CNN) -- The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced Wednesday it will donate $50 million to help fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. More than 2,200 people have died in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the outbreak has been concentrated. Cases have also been reported in nearby Nigeria and Senegal. The foundation says the money will be used to enable international aid organizations and national governments ""to purchase badly needed supplies and scale up emergency operations in affected countries."" It will also ""work with public and private sector partners to accelerate the development of therapies, vaccines, and diagnostics that could be effective in treating patients and preventing further transmission of the disease."" The first human trial of an experimental Ebola vaccine began last week at the National Institutes of Health. This is considered the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history. The World Health Organization said Monday the rapid spread of the virus in Liberia shows no sign of slowing. ""The number of new cases is increasing exponentially,"" WHO said, calling the situation a ""dire emergency with ... unprecedented dimensions of human suffering."" Taxis packed with families who fear they've contracted the deadly virus criss-cross the Liberian capital, searching for a place where they can be treated, WHO said. But there are no available beds. ""As soon as a new Ebola treatment facility is opened, it immediately fills to overflowing with patients,"" the U.N. group said. To help ease some of the burden on West Africa's already over-taxed medical system, the United States announced Tuesday it will send $10 million in additional funds. That's in addition to the $100 million Washington has already sent to help fight the outbreak. USAID also announced it will make $75 million in extra funds available. The new funds will pay for transportation and support to send 100 more health care workers to help fight the epidemic. The WHO and several nonprofit agencies on the ground have repeatedly called for the international community to send additional trained help. USAID funding has already provided 130,000 sets of personal protective equipment, 50,000 hygiene kits, and 1,000 new beds. USAID has created a website where trained nurses, physician assistants or doctors who want to help can sign up. On Sunday, President Barack Obama said the Ebola outbreak needs to be a ""national security priority."" Obama told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the U.S. military could help set up isolation units and provide security for public health workers. ""If we don't make that effort now, and this spreads not just through Africa but other parts of the world, there's the prospect then that the virus mutates. It becomes more easily transmittable. And then it could be a serious danger to the United States,"" he said. U.S. 'ill-prepared' for a pandemic, feds say .

"(CNN) -- Every 40 seconds someone in the world takes their own life, a global tally of more than 800,000 suicides a year, according to a landmark United Nations report on the subject. The research found that suicide killed more people each year than conflicts and natural catastrophes, accounting for more than half of the world's 1.5 million violent deaths annually, World Health Organization staff told reporters at its presentation in Geneva. The report, the U.N. agency's first on the subject, analyzed data on suicides from 172 countries, and took a decade to compile. Setting a goal to cut national suicide rates by 10 percent by 2020, the organization said suicide was a major but preventable health problem that health authorities had failed to adequately address due to a number of complicated factors. Shrouded in taboo . ""This report is a call for action to address a large public health problem which has been shrouded in taboo for far too long,"" Dr. Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO, said in a statement. While warning that data on national suicide rates was imperfect, with fewer than half the surveyed countries keeping accurate figures, the WHO said it used available data to produce estimates on suicide prevalence worldwide. The global rate was estimated at 11.4 per 100,000, with men almost twice as likely as women to take their own lives -- rising to as many as three times more male victims than female in some richer countries. On average, high-income countries had a slightly higher suicide rate -- 12.7 per 100,000 people -- than low- and middle-income nations, where the rate was 11.2. Mental health help: Where to turn . Highest rates . The most suicide-prone countries were Guyana (44.2 per 100,000), followed by North Korea (38.5), South Korea (28.9), Sri Lanka (28.8), Lithuania (28.2), Suriname (27.8), Mozambique (27.4), Nepal and Tanzania (24.9 each) and Burundi (23.1). The report found suicide rates were highest globally among those aged 70 years and over, but highest among the young in some countries -- and was the second leading cause of death for 15-29 year-olds globally. Among the challenges in tackling suicide were intense media coverage when celebrities kill themselves, as witnessed in the recent death of U.S. comedian Robin Williams, which could glamorize the act and fuel suicide ""contagion,"" the report stated. Opinion: Suicide doesn't set you free . Most vulnerable . Another factor was that suicide victims often came from marginalized groups and were difficult to access with interventions. The report stated that the most common methods of suicide globally were pesticide poisoning -- particularly in rural areas -- hanging and firearms. Evidence had shown that restricting access to these methods can could help reduce the number of deaths. Also vital to lowering the suicide rate was a commitment by governments to implement national action plans on suicide -- something only 28 countries currently had in place. ""We know what works,"" said Dr. Shekhar Saxena, the WHO's mental health director. ""Now is the time to act."" 'Suicide tourism' to Switzerland has doubled since 2009 .","Landmark WHO report estimates one suicide in the world every 40 seconds, or 800,000 a year .

"(CNN) -- For African business leaders who study and further their training overseas, returning to the continent can be even tougher. It can be hard for them to commit to returning to the even smaller economies of their home countries, says Krishna Patel, HSBC's CEO for Africa. ""You get expatriate Ghanaians and Nigerians with the best will in the world wanting to come back,"" Patel told CNN. ""But they find themselves employed [in Europe or the United States] and think, 'I'm one man, I'm one woman, and I have an opportunity here.'"" There is a steady flow of Africans leaving their homeland to study overseas. Students from sub-Saharan Africa are the most mobile in the world, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). As many as one in three higher education students in Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland study abroad according to a UNESCO report. By comparison, one out of every 250 North American students studies overseas. South African Richard Remmington, an IT manager studying for an MBA at Oxford's Saïd Business School, said there just aren't that many opportunities back home. While South Africa has seen a surge in corporate opportunities for talented businessmen and women, ""the economy is just too small to accommodate the kind of jobs they want to do,"" Remmington told CNN. Even when young Africans want to combat the so-called ""brain drain,"" it can be difficult for them to find the right opportunities back home. ""This group of people, despite how important they are to the continent, are having the darndest time connecting to opportunities back home,"" said Okendo Lewis-Gayle. He's the president of Harambe Endeavor, an alliance of African students and young professionals studying at top academic institutions around the world. Right now, there's no systematic way for these young leaders to go home and be effective, said Lewis-Gayle, who started Harambe with a Zimbabwean classmate at Southern New Hampshire University in the United States three years ago. ""Because many of them still have this perception of the 'dark continent,' that nothing is going on, they don't even try,"" he said. Communication and recruitment challenges are some of the biggest obstacles facing young business leaders who want to return home, according to Lewis-Gayle. Harambe organizers hear African graduates expressing particular frustration about a lack of information on how to find the jobs that suit their backgrounds. For example, Lewis-Gayle said, China is investing heavily in Africa, which is creating several opportunities. Yet you have African students in Taiwan or  Beijing who really don't know how they can be effective back home. ""Someone who is African and is educated in China or Taiwan and speaks fluent Chinese shouldn't be wondering what he or she can do back home,"" he said. Fledgling organizations like Harambe, which connect young workers with businesses seeking to invest or expand in their countries of origin, are helping to tackle this problem. Harambe has helped launch entrepreneurship programs in Burkina Faso, Cameroon and Ghana as well as a microfinance scheme in Ethiopia. But it's been an uphill battle getting these programs off the ground. ""There's this barrier of folks kind of looking down on the youth and not thinking that they're ready or prepared to be of value -- this is huge, because in countries where youth is encouraged and supported, its easier for people to start things,"" Lewis-Gayle said. It isn't just creating and finding opportunities, but funding them as well, that can keep young executives from going home. A Harvard University African higher education survey found that recent graduates interested in entrepreneurship felt they couldn't turn their new ideas and skills into viable businesses in their countries of origin, due to an almost complete lack of venture capital. But the overall business climate is starting to change, as investors eye Africa's growth potential, and that could lead to more options for expatriates wanting to return home, Patel from HSBC said. ""The world has had a very big jolt,"" he told CNN. ""Suddenly the risk adjustment on returns from Africa is looking like a good opportunity.""","Young African business leaders who study abroad find it difficult to connect to business opportunities back home .

"(CNN) -- Alaskans were shaken up -- but not, it seems, rattled -- by a 6.2-magnitude earthquake and more than a dozen aftershocks that struck in the state Thursday. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that the biggest tremor struck at 9:51 a.m. local time (1:51 p.m. ET), centered some 80 miles northwest of Anchorage. Its large magnitude was balanced out, somewhat, by how far down it occurred -- 64 miles deep, according to the USGS. ""Normally, we don't have large magnitude quakes this deep,"" said Alaska Earthquake Information Center seismologist Natalia Ruppert, noting that the tremor was felt strongly in Fairbanks and as far south as Kodiak. ""Because it was that deep, it didn't cause as much damage as a shallower quake."" Still, it was big enough to create messes and cause scares in the state dubbed The Last Frontier. Pictures on CNN affiliate KTUU's website showed a toppled bookcase and strewn papers in a lawyer's office, hair supplies toppled onto a Walmart's floor, as well as cracked walls and floors. The Anchorage School District tweeted out a picture of students huddled under tables in a library as a damaged ceiling panel dangled overheard. Sven Gustafson, principal of Anchorage's Romig Middle School, praised his students for doing ""great duck, cover, and holding!"" ""What a shaker this morning!"" Gustafson tweeted. ""...Some small damage that will be repaired."" Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reporter Casey Grove tweeted that he was on the sixth floor of an Anchorage courthouse when the earthquake struck, noting that one employee there noticed ""desks were bounding, chairs were rolling around."" And afterward, crews from Alaska's Department of Transportation and Public Facilities had to clean up some debris and rocks that fell onto the Seward Highway.Â . While Thursday's quake may have been big -- and, according to Anchorage police spokeswoman Jennifer Castro, abnormally long -- it didn't come as a total shock. ""Normally, we have around 100 earthquakes in Alaska each day,"" said Ruppert, the seismologist. CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","NEW: There are more than a dozen aftershocks following the main quake .

"(CNN) -- We all know the feeling of dread that washes over you when standing at the baggage carousel after a flight. ""Did my bag make it?"" In the last couple of years, another wrinkle has been added to the mix in the form of bag fees. In the past, if an airline lost, delayed or damaged your bag, you could get compensation. That's still true today, but what about that fee you paid just for the right to check your bag? Can you get that back? While some airlines will give you something back, the majority won't. That's surprising to a lot of people, and it doesn't really seem fair. Are you paying just to check your bag or are you paying for it to actually get to your destination when you do? Only one airline will refund your bag fees if your bag is lost, delayed, or damaged and that's Frontier, with its hubs in Denver and Milwaukee. Kudos to Frontier for doing the right thing, but very few others will do anything at all. Alaska led the way in compensating travelers when it first introduced its bag fees for the first checked bag. Now, if you aren't reunited with your bags within 20 minutes of arriving at the gate, you're entitled to a $20 discount on a future flight or 2,000 bonus miles in the airline's frequent flier program. There are a couple of catches. This won't automatically get put into your account -- you'll have to talk to someone at the airport within two hours of your arrival to get the credit. Also, it's only one coupon per person, regardless of how many bags were checked. Delta has also decided to do something in this arena, but it's structured differently. If your bags are delayed more than 12 hours on Delta, and you've paid the first and second bag fees, then you can get a credit as well. But on Delta it's a $25 credit for the first bag and another $25 if you had a second bag. Unfortunately, this is really the end of the line when it comes to getting something in return when your bags go missing. United has a bag fee refund form, as do others, but the only reasons it says it gives refunds are if there were duplicate charges, if you didn't travel or if you didn't actually check a bag. If your bag was delayed, it appears you aren't getting that fee back in any shape or form. Southwest and JetBlue, of course, won't refund your money for checking that first bag, because they don't charge a fee for those bags. Instead, they bake the cost into the ticket price, and you aren't getting a refund for that. There is a little bit of relief on the horizon from the federal government, but it's really minor at best. Regulation soon goes into effect that will require airlines to refund bag fees but only if the bag is lost permanently. In other words, if your bag is simply delayed for a day or two or 10, then this regulation doesn't apply. It's only if that bag is lost and gone forever. Not much teeth to this rule. So what can you do? Well, if your bag is lost or delayed, you can always try contacting customer relations at the airline. Depending upon the situation, that might be able to get you some bonus miles or a voucher, but that's the luck of the draw.","Brett Snyder thinks travelers should receive refunds if they don't get their luggage .

"(CNN) -- A 32-year-old man downed dozens of roaches and worms to win a python at a Florida reptile store, then collapsed and died outside minutes later. Edward Archbold was among 20 to 30 contestants participating in Friday night's ""Midnight Madness"" event at Ben Siegel Reptiles in Deerfield Beach, authorities said. The participants' goal: consume as many insects and worms as they could to take home a $850 python. Archbold swallowed roach after roach, worm after worm. While the store didn't say exactly how many Archbold consumed, the owner told CNN affiliate WPLG that he was ""the life of the party."" ""He really made our night more fun,"" Ben Siegel told the station. Soon after the contest was over, Archbold fell ill and began to vomit, the Broward County Sheriff's Office said Monday. A friend called for medical help. Then, Archbold himself dialed 911, the store said in a Facebook post. Eventually, he fell to the ground outside the store, the sheriff's office said. An ambulance took him to North Broward Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. The Broward Medical Examiner's Office conducted an autopsy and are awaiting test results to determine the cause of his death. No other contestant fell ill, the sheriff's office said. ""Very saddened by this. I mean, it was a shock,"" Siegel told WPLG. ""Eddie was a very nice guy. We just met him that night, but everybody that works here was very fond of him."" Luke Lirot, who says he is legally representing the store, said in a post on the store's Facebook page that all participants ""signed thorough waivers accepting responsibility for their participation in this unique and unorthodox contest."" ""The consumption of insects is widely accepted throughout the world, and the insects presented as part of the contest were taken from an inventory of insects that are safely and domestically raised in a controlled environment as food for reptiles,"" Lirot said. In the wild, cockroaches are scavengers that pick up various bacterial organisms such as salmonella while walking through spoiled food, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene explains on its website. Cockroaches themselves don't transmit disease, though ""many disease-causing organisms can grow and multiply in their guts and can then be deposited ... during defecation."" Pharaoh Gayles was one of those who took part in the contest. He explained his reasoning to CNN affiliate WPTV. ""Some of the snakes were pretty expensive,"" he said. ""I thought if I could eat the bugs to get one, it'd be a good idea.""

"Tulsa, Oklahoma (CNN) -- They'd gone to W. Scott Harrington's dentist office in a Tulsa, Oklahoma, suburb to have a wisdom tooth pulled or perhaps have their jaw realigned. On Saturday, scores of his patients were waiting to be checked once again -- this time not to replace missing teeth, say, but to find out whether they'd been exposed to hepatitis or HIV. By 3 p.m. local time Saturday, one hour later than planned, some 420 people -- out of 7,000 of Harrington's patients from the past six years who health authorities reached out to -- had been screened for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV at the Tulsa Health Department. They came after investigators discovered unsanitary, unprofessional conditions at Harrington's office in Owasso, 14 miles northeast of Tulsa, that one official said created a ""perfect storm"" for infections. Within two weeks, those tested Saturday (and when the screenings resume starting Monday) should get the results back -- all because they'd gone to see an oral surgeon with 35 years of experience. ""How do you say you're sorry to 7,000 people that you could possibly have infected?"" said Melissa Wood, whose daughter -- a patient of Harrington's -- spent part of her 18th birthday getting tested. Harrington, 64, surrendered his dental license on March 20 after health investigators found sterilization, staffing and other infractions. ""I will tell you that when ... we left, we were just physically kind of sick,"" Susan Rogers, executive director of the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry, said earlier this week. ""That's how bad it was, and I've seen a lot of bad stuff over the years."" The dentistry board launched its probe after one of Harrington's patients came down with hepatitis C. That patient originally tested positive for HIV, too, but a subsequent test came back negative, the Tulsa Health Department said. While other states conduct random inspections of dentist offices with some regularity, Rogers told the Tulsa World newspaper that dentists' offices in Oklahoma are inspected only after a complaint is filed. 5 things to check at the dentist's office . Investigators raised a number of sterilization and ""cross-contamination"" alarms -- such as ""unauthorized, unlicensed"" employees using IVs to sedate patients and that needles weren't handled properly. The outward cleanliness of the office belied the mess elsewhere, Rogers said, noting that ""just basic universal precautions for blood-borne pathogens"" weren't followed. Besides being ""unlocked and unattended,"" the drug cabinet was rife with issues -- containing, for example, a drug that expired in 1993 -- according to the official complaint filed before the state dental board. Other records showed that morphine had been used in patients throughout 2012, even though the dentist had not received a morphine delivery since 2009. Harrington and his attorney have not returned multiple calls from CNN. And the oral surgeon wasn't home when a CNN crew went there on Saturday. ""He seems highly competent to me, just a smart guy,"" said Frank Dale, one of Harrington's neighbors. ""I was just shocked when I heard it. And I feel badly for him. I feel badly for his patients."" A teenage patient, who asked not to be named, told CNN he had a bad experience at Harrington's office a year ago. During a surgery to remove three molars, he awoke momentarily to see profuse bleeding. He said he became alarmed but was told to ""shut up"" and hold gauze in place. When he awoke a second time, he was tied up on the floor. Harrington's staff explained that he had been ""combative"" during the operation, he said. Dentist's office a 'perfect storm' for HIV, hepatitis exposure . ""I felt when I got out of there and went through all I went through, I felt they didn't know much of what they were doing at all,"" he said. Wood's teenage daughter, Marissa, said she finds it ""horrifying"" that her June 2011 visit to get her wisdom teeth extracted may have put her at risk for HIV or hepatitis. She remembered thinking of Harrington as a ""really nice guy"" -- but that was then. ""I'm angry,"" she said. ""I feel like he's ... let us down. I feel like he's let a lot of people down."" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides national guidelines for dental offices to help prevent the spread of infections. They include cleaning and sterilizing all nondisposable items such as dental tools between patients, disinfecting surfaces and requiring staff members to wear protective masks, gloves and eye wear. Since 1991, only three cases of dental infection in patients have been documented -- two with hepatitis B and one with HIV, according to the CDC. No cases of hepatitis C have been reported. ""This is exceedingly rare,"" said Dr. Matt Messina, a consumer adviser and spokesman for the American Dental Association, of the allegations levied against Harrington. ""I'm just angry, because this is a case, I think, so far outside of the bounds of normal that it makes it remarkable."" The infection risks are compounded given that Harrington told investigators he had a higher-than-normal population proportionally of HIV and hepatitis patients, Rogers said. HIV is a condition that over time destroys a body's immune system, thus its ability to fight infections. If not treated, nearly all those infected with HIV will develop AIDS, according to the National Institutes of Health. Hepatitis -- the most common types being hepatitis A, B and C -- refers to inflammation or viral infections of one's liver. Some 4.4 million Americans have chronic hepatitis, though most of them don't know it, the CDC says. Oklahoma dentist let unlicensed staffers give IVs, state official says .

"(CNN) -- In October 2013, my daughter came home from school excited about Christopher Columbus. He had come to visit her class! During his visit, he told the children that he had figured out the world was round and then bravely led his crew to discover America. Then they all made telescopes. As a father and history professor, I was caught off-guard. Columbus actually didn't figure out the world was round. He didn't really discover America, either. And telescopes weren't around until about a century after Columbus died. But what do you tell a 5-year-old who has bought into a myth? And how do you do it without constructing an anti-myth, pegging the explorer as one of the most evil people to walk the Earth? What should we tell our children about Columbus? I asked that question of William Phillips, professor of history at the University of Minnesota and co-author of ""The Worlds of Christopher Columbus,"" and of LeAnne Howe, the Eidson Professor in American Literature at the University of Georgia and an enrolled member of the Choctaw Nation. In both cases, professors started from the same principle: Tell the kids the truth. The story goes that Columbus had to persevere against the odds to get support for his venture, because everyone but him believed the Earth was flat. This just isn't true. The ancient Greeks proved that the Earth was round about 2,000 years ago, and one even used the shadow of the Earth on the moon during an eclipse to estimate its circumference. The problem for Columbus is that he was bad at math and worse at geography, and everyone with an education knew it. ""He failed to get funding for a long time,"" Phillips wrote, ""because his calculations of the earth were on the small side, he thought that dry land covered more of the sphere than it does, and he believed Japan was some 1500 miles off the coast of China."" In other words, most people knew roughly the distance between the west coast of Europe and the east coast of Asia but believed it was filled with a vast ocean in which Columbus would surely die. Instead of Columbus Day, cities celebrate Indigenous People's Day . Columbus was stubborn. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, he refused to give up his plan, and because he was so stubborn, he kept fighting for funding until he finally broke through to the Queen of Spain. His stubbornness also, as both professors noted, kept him from ever admitting that he hadn't reached Asia. For Columbus, the idea of a whole new continent and unknown peoples just didn't fit his worldview. The indigenous peoples of the Caribbean, however, were used to hosting strange arrivals from all over the Americas in their towns, according to Howe. Their settlements were decades or even centuries old, built in part on transcontinental trade, and Columbus did not seem so outlandish. These were settled lands with rich societies, not, as often depicted, simple or primitive. That's one of the real tragedies of the story of Columbus and probably the hardest part to explain to children. The complex indigenous societies of the Americas were decimated by exposure to Old World diseases, crumbling under the weight of epidemic. By the time later waves of settlers arrived in North America, they often found wilderness. It was a new wilderness, born of drastic population decline. Columbus didn't know that his voyage would spread diseases across the continents, of course, but disease wasn't the only problem. Columbus sailed the ocean blue not for the love of exploration but because he wanted access to Asian gold. Instead, he found marvelous soft cotton, which Howe says was far superior to similar cloth in Europe. He also took slaves for display back home and to work in his conquered lands. Cloth and slavery defined the Columbian exchange from the beginning. Despite all this, it's not correct to simply demonize Columbus. He was a brave man, launching his ships into an uncertain fate, driven by greed, faith and hope. Like many brave men, he believed very strongly that he knew what he was doing -- even though he was wrong about so many details -- and it's OK to be impressed by his bravery. Moreover, his voyages had an undeniable historical impact, sparking the great age of Atlantic exploration, trade and eventually colonization by Europeans. In a very real way, this era reshaped the world, the languages we speak, the religions we follow, the foods we eat and the diseases we catch. I don't know if that's a reason to have a school holiday, exactly, but it's definitely worth remembering. So if your child comes home in the leadup to Columbus Day, like mine did, full of praise for the explorer's bravery and vision, that's a fine place to start, even if he didn't really ""discover"" the Americas or figure out that the Earth was round. He was, indeed, brave. But then explain that brave people can do bad things, and worse things can happen without any planning. That's one of the lessons of history.","David Perry's daughter came home from school with some notions about Columbus .

"(CNN) -- The chief prosecutor in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius accused him on Monday of ""tailoring"" his version of how he killed his girlfriend, as the grueling cross-examination of the track star went into a second week. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has accused the athlete of hiding the truth about the death of Reeva Steenkamp, whom he shot last year through a closed toilet door in his luxury home in Pretoria, South Africa. His questions have sought to undermine Pistorius' reliability and credibility and to portray the Olympic and Paralympic athlete as someone who was inventing his version of events to suit his story. Nel, known in South African legal circles for his bulldog-like approach to questioning, has gone through minute detail regarding the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, repeatedly challenging the double amputee over his actions that night. On Monday, in yet another intense scrutiny of his story, the prosecutor again tried to exhaustively highlight apparent inconsistencies between Pistorius' bail application and his testimony in court to show he is ""tailoring his evidence"" to suit the defense case. ""I am going to point out to you how improbable your version is,"" Nel told the runner, who sat immobile, staring ahead at the judge as he answered questions. The prosecution's argument is that Pistorius shot Steenkamp intentionally after a heated argument. Pistorius does not deny shooting her but insists that he mistook her for an intruder. ""I did not fire at Reeva,"" Pistorius told the court, his voice breaking, causing a second brief adjournment in the day's proceedings so he could gather himself. Scrutinizing every detail . Nel took Pistorius detail by detail through what happened on the night of Steenkamp's death -- where he moved, how he moved, what he saw -- aggressively questioning him about the moments before the shooting. Speaking about the noise he said he thought had been caused by intruders, the athlete described how he started shouting. Asked what he shouted, Pistorius broke down as he answered: ""Get the f**k out of my house. Get the f**k out of my house."" 'I was screaming' The prosecutor pressed on why the athlete didn't give fuller details of his account in his bail statement. Pistorius said then that there was a noise from the bathroom that caused him to think that people had broken into his house. He later explained that it was the bathroom window sliding across and slamming against the frame. The athlete said on Monday that he was on medication and traumatized while in a jail cell at the time of his bail statement. Nel also said it was improbable that, according to Pistorius' story, Steenkamp did not ask him why he was getting out of bed in the middle of the night to retrieve fans from the edge of the balcony. He repeatedly asked the athlete why he fired, and if he did so intentionally. ""No, I did not,"" Pistorius said. ""I fired because I got a fright."" Nel has openly called the athlete's version ""a lie,"" contending Pistorius knew exactly what he was doing when he fired his gun. ""I blame myself for taking Reeva's life,"" Pistorius said. Describing what happened after the shots, Pistorius' high-pitched voice wobbled. He said he went to the bed and realized Steenkamp was not there, and then felt the curtains to see if she was behind them. ""Then I was panicking, realizing she wasn't answering,"" the runner said. ""I was screaming, I was screaming out for her."" Nel said his next line of questioning would deal with the toilet. He asked to continue on Tuesday morning and the trial was adjourned for the day. 'Emotional memories' The prosecutor has repeatedly asked the runner why he was getting ""emotional"" as Nel's questioning has drawn tears. ""Is it about what happened, or the questions and your frustration with answering them?"" Nel said, asking Pistorius if he was using his emotions as an escape. Pistorius said he was not. ""It's emotional memories for me,"" the runner replied. Pistorius, 27, has denied he acted selfishly toward Steenkamp, who was 29 when she died. In a bid to paint their relationship as rocky, Nel has ripped apart message exchanges between the couple. Nel also sought to paint Pistorius as selfish and demanded to know why the athlete did not respond to his girlfriend's declaration of love. But Pistorius said he preferred to talk to his girlfriend over the phone rather than messaging. He acknowledged he never got a chance to tell her that he loved her. ""Because it was all about Mr. Pistorius,"" Nel said. The trial has gripped South Africa, where Pistorius is considered a symbol of triumph over physical adversity. His disabled lower legs were amputated when he was a baby, but he went on to achieve global fame as the ""Blade Runner,"" winning numerous Paralympic gold medals on the steel blades fitted to his prostheses. Only those in the courtroom can see Pistorius because he has chosen not to testify on camera. His testimony can be heard on an audio feed. Steenkamp's mother, June Steenkamp, has been in court throughout his testimony. The trial is scheduled to continue until the middle of May. Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials.

"(CNN) -- With Ferrari currently enduring one of its least competitive Formula 1 seasons in years, the man who helped the team to the top of the sport is to step down as chairman. More than two decades after first taking up the post in 1991, Luca di Montezemolo will leave the Scuderia on October 13, with chief executive officer of parent company Fiat Sergio Marchionne is set to succeed him. ""This is the end of an era and so I have decided to leave my position as chairman after almost 23 marvellous and unforgettable years,"" read a statement from Di Montezemolo. Under the Italian success became almost routine for Ferrari. Eight Constructors' World Championships arrived in that time, while Michael Schumacher dominated as a Scuderia driver, claiming five straight World Championships between 2000 and 2004. Away from the track, Di Montezemolo also played a key role away in helping to transform the brand into one of the world's finest luxury car makers. ""Ferrari is the most wonderful company in the world. It has been a great privilege and honour to have been its leader,"" Di Montezemolo's statement continued. ""I devoted all of my enthusiasm and commitment to it over the years. Together with my family, it was, and continues to be, the most important thing in my life."" Marchionne paid tribute to the man he is due to succeed -- someone he was appointed alongside to the Fiat Board of Directors in 2003. ""We worked side by side, sharing concerns, difficulties and successes,"" said Marchionne in a statement. ""As chairman of Ferrari, he drove the company to a new level of technological and organizational excellence which also brought with it outstanding financial results."" Since 2008, however, Ferrari have been starved of such successes, with the team having now gone nearly six years without either a Drivers' or Constructors' World Championship title. The 67-year-old Di Montezemolo's future had been the subject of speculation due to Ferrari's poor form on the track this year -- Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen sit fifth and 10th respectively in the World Championship standings, while the team itself lie fourth in the Constructors' World Championship, 292 points off leaders Mercedes. Reports emerged ahead of Sunday's Italian Grand Prix in Monza about a Di Montezemolo exit, although the Italian was insistent afterwards about staying in the role despite Ferrari suffering their worst performance of the season -- Alonso was forced to retire, while Raikkonen had to settle for ninth. Marchionne, though, immediately contradicted his colleague -- ""We are good friends but his statements... these are things I wouldn't have said myself. ""Luca and I have discussed the future of Ferrari at length,"" Marchionne's statement continued. ""And our mutual desire to see Ferrari achieve its true potential on the track has led to misunderstandings which became clearly visible over the last weekend. ""I want to thank Luca for all he has done for Fiat, for Ferrari and for me personally."" Di Montezemolo first arrived at Ferrari in 1973, becoming assistant to the manufacturer's founder, Enzo Ferrari, before going on to manage the team from 1974. A number of different roles in Fiat followed during the 1980s, before he assumed his position as president in 1991. ""I wish the shareholders, particularly Piero Ferrari who has always been by my side, and everyone in the Company the many more years of success that Ferrari deserves,"" Di Montezemolo added.","Luca di Montezemolo to resign as Ferrari chairman .

"(CNN) -- Ever since it was discovered in 2004, graphene has been hailed as a natural wonder of the materials world destined to transform our lives in the 21st century. Graphene's amazing properties excite and confound in equal measure. How can something one million times thinner than a human hair be 300 times stronger than steel and 1,000 times more conductive than silicon? CNN Labs asked the head of MIT's graphene research department, Tomas Palacios, to explain why graphene is such a special material and what we can expect it to do for us in the future. CNN: What is graphene? Tomas Palacios (TP): Graphene is a one-atom thick layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice. This special atomic arrangement gives graphene truly unique properties. For example electrical currents in graphene move faster than in any other material we know of. Watch: The secret to making better batteries . Heat can also move in graphene very fast and it is the best thermal conductor that we have. On top of this, graphene is the thinnest material in the world as well as the strongest, much stronger than steel and, of course, much lighter. Finally, because it is only one atom thick, it is perfectly transparent and flexible. CNN: What applications will it have? TP: The very first application where graphene is going to be used is probably as a replacement for (the relatively expensive metal) indium selenide in solar cells. After that, I think we will see a new array of communication devices that don't just use graphene but which also use other two-dimensional materials. Products such as cell phones will be integrated into the likes of the clothes, pieces of paper and in windows. Another direction is transparent displays. Basically we are going to have electronic displays embedded almost everywhere, in the windows, in our glasses, in the walls, everywhere. To do this we need very thin materials that are also transparent and graphene could be that material. CNN: When will products containing graphene be available? TP: It depends on the specific application. I believe that the use of graphene in solar cells, displays and so on is probably going to be in the marketplace in a couple of years. More complex applications such as computers or cell phones will probably take longer, maybe within five and ten years. CNN: What challenges remain for researchers? TP: One important challenge facing graphene is the way the material is developed. Graphene was isolated for the first time using the Scotch Tape technique (where ever thinner strips are peeled off a block of graphite using sticky tape) and the quantities we can make in large areas still lag behind this method. There has been a lot of work to try and enhance the manufacturability of graphene and there are a few techniques that look very promising but they are not completely mature yet. The second challenge is that graphene is a material that is only one atom thick. Anything that you do to it is going to impact its properties. We still need to understand better how to fabricate graphene devices and how to be gentle enough not to (break) the formula. CNN: Are production methods improving? Recently, Samsung Electronics has demonstrated a single layer of graphene which is 30 inches in diameter. So in just a few years we have gone from micro-meter sized flakes all the way to 30 inches. The ambition is that one day graphene will be fabricated in the same way that you print newspapers -- in a roll to roll process using the same kind of equipment. This will change the entire economics of the electronics industry. CNN: Are there any other materials like graphene? TP: Graphene was the first two-dimensional material to be discovered, but it is not the only one. Now there are more than 10 materials that are all two-dimensional with complimentary properties that could be integrated with graphene to provide extra functionality. Boron nitride for example is also one-atom thick and instead of being a conductor it is an insulator (of heat), the best insulator we know. If you go to three atoms thick we have another material called molybdenum disulfide which is a semi-conductor, like silicon, but lighter and stronger. These materials can then be combined in order to fabricate completely new material structures that don't exist in nature. I think that that is a very powerful proposition. CNN: When will graphene-based products hit main street? TP: If you look at how long it traditionally takes new materials to make an impact in the market, it typically takes around 20 years. We need to be patient but things seem to be moving faster than with other materials. I think the next couple of years will see quite significant improvements in the growth techniques and synthesis of two-dimensional materials. At a basic research level we are going to see an emphasis on trying to understand what happens when you stack these materials one on top of the other. That is going to enable a lot of new understanding which will enable completely new devices. I am completely convinced that graphene is going to end up changing our lives. Exactly how, I don't know and I don't think anyone can know for sure but there is nothing thinner, stronger or more suitable to conduct electricity and that has to be useful for many important things.","Graphene is the world's first two-dimensional material to be discovered .

"(CNN) -- More than a month ago, the public health community celebrated the polio-free certification of Southeast Asia including India, viewed as a hopeful step toward global eradication. But the euphoria has waned as concerns grow the virus is making a comeback and re-appearing in countries that had previously eliminated the disease within their borders. Pakistan has seen major challenges in recent years, reporting 80% of polio cases this year. The country faces challenges within its health system including restricted access to its federally administered tribal areas and violence against polio campaign health workers. Vaccine workers have been tortured, shot, bombed, and even have had their family members kidnapped. ""You have disruption of health services, vaccination services are broken where areas are no-go because there is mistrust and health teams are not allowed within the conflict area,"" said Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who is co-director of The Hospital for Sick Children in Canada and also works in Pakistan. ""In that particular circumstance, to imagine that business would be as usual is naÃ¯ve."" While Pakistan faces hurdles, India's polio program has been lauded as a model for tackling polio. India's program ""was largely internally funded, strongly managed,"" said Bhutta. Once considered the hardest place to end polio, India boosted disease surveillance and immunization efforts to vaccinate hard-to-reach communities. To counter rumors and misgivings about the vaccine, social mobilizers, religious leaders and parents were included to increase understanding about immunizations. ""In Pakistan, that political will in terms of making this a national priority hasn't existed,"" Bhutta said. ""They haven't invested enough in routine immunizations, which are critical to eradicating polio. You've got to get people aware of the importance of preventive strategies."" In 2014, the World Health Organization confirmed 74 new cases of polio -- 59 of them were in Pakistan. Within Pakistan, 46 of these cases have been from its restive Federally Administered Tribal Areas, which is located along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and retains internal autonomy. The country with the second highest number of polio cases is Afghanistan, which reported four cases. But all of these are related to viruses that originated from Pakistan, according to the WHO. Emergency measures recommended . On Monday, the WHO recommended emergency measures for three of the countries deemed as the greatest risk for further exporting the virus -- Syria, Cameroon and Pakistan. The organization called for residents of these countries to get vaccinated and show proof of polio immunization before international travel. It also calls for the head of state to declare polio a national public health emergency. ""If the situation as of today and April 2014 went unchecked, it could result in failure to eradicate globally one of the world's most serious vaccine preventable diseases,"" said Dr. Bruce Aylward, assistant director-general for polio, emergencies and country collaboration at the WHO. Pakistan has been establishing vaccination booths at its land borders with Afghanistan, China, India and also Iran, according to the WHO. Bhutta said he wasn't surprised by the WHO's move, but worried the recommendation was a ""Band-Aid measure"" that's ""not going get to the root of the problem."" This may divert the vaccines and human resources from Pakistan communities that need them the most, to the huge number of travelers, Bhutta said. ""I'm concerned that will take away from the main polio control program and that's the last thing anybody wanted."" Pakistan is considered the only country that is ""off track"" in meeting its target to stop polio transmission, according to the WHO. Militants in Pakistan have targeted anti-polio campaigns since U.S. intelligence officials used a fake vaccination program to aid their hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011. Since then, militant groups, with connections to the Pakistani Taliban, have been opposing polio vaccinations and accusing health workers of pursuing a political agenda. Dozens have been killed in acts of violence carried out against polio vaccine workers. Pakistan has tried to protect its health workers from violence. In Peshawar, authorities banned the riding of motorcycles during vaccine campaigns to prevent attacks, said Aylward. Polio, which can cause permanent paralysis in hours, has been reported in 10 countries: Afghanistan, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Israel, Somalia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Cameroon and Syria.","India celebrated its polio-free certification in late March .

"(CNN) -- Lawyers painted opposing pictures of South African athlete Oscar Pistorius in their final arguments Friday before his sentencing -- one side depicting him as a broken man who's suffered enough, while the other said he must pay for taking his girlfriend's life. Pistorius, 27, is due to be sentenced for culpable homicide, or negligent killing, as well as one weapons-related charge, after a hearing lasting several days. After both sides' final arguments concluded Friday, Masipa said the court would reconvene Tuesday for sentencing. Defense lawyer Barry Roux appealed to the judge to remember that he reacted as a vulnerable disabled man when he shot Reeva Steenkamp dead. The evidence presented in court demonstrated that as a double amputee, Pistorius' negligent actions in the shooting could not be seen outside the context of his disability, he said. He did not act unlawfully, but out of fear, Roux said. There is no reason to doubt that Pistorius believed there was an intruder in the bathroom who posed a threat to him and to Steenkamp when he fired the fatal shots through the toilet door, Roux said. ""Whatever way you see it, the accused's actions were in some way dominated by vulnerability and anxiety,"" he said. ""It's a compromised person doing that."" A sentence of imprisonment should be a last resort, and a combination of other options should be considered, he argued. ""It can never be a suitable punishment,"" he said of a prison term. Whatever punishment is handed down, the athlete could not suffer more than in the past 18 months, when he was denigrated, shamed and blamed, on top of losing the woman he loved, Roux said. Pistorius is now a ""broken man,"" he said, who has lost everything he once had. The athlete at times appeared emotional as he sat with his head bowed while the arguments were made over his fate. Steenkamp's parents, Barry and June, listened impassively in the benches nearby. Pistorius' sentence -- whether imprisonment or not -- will be decided by Judge Thokozile Masipa, who also presided over his trial. Prosecutor: 'He's not a victim' State Prosecutor Gerrie Nel, famed for his bulldog tenacity in cross-examinations during the trial, called for a minimum prison sentence of 10 years in his final arguments. This, he said, would be ""the minimum term that society will be happy with."" ""This is a serious matter,"" he said. ""The negligence borders on intent. Ten years is the minimum."" He recalled the testimony of Steenkamp's cousin, Kim Martin, who made an emotional appeal for the court to make Pistorius pay with prison for what he did to Reeva and her family. His disabilities had already been taken into account in deciding the verdict, Nel said. He said it was right that the court was shown a bloody photograph of what happened to Steenkamp when she was hit by three of the four bullets fired from Pistorius' high-powered handgun. ""It's not an accused that had a gun with normal ammunition that every other person had, it was devastating, damaging Black Talon ammunition,"" he said. A reasonable man would have known the consequences of firing that ammunition into a small toilet cubicle, he said, recalling that the judge found in her verdict that Pistorius acted negligently, too hastily and with excessive force. Pistorius wanted to use the firearm, he said. ""He's not a victim,"" he said of the athlete. ""He cannot be a victim -- he caused it."" The victims in the case are Steenkamp and her parents, who had to receive a phone call with the news any parent would dread, he said. Says correctional supervision not appropriate . Nel told the court that the sentence of correctional supervision -- as suggested by the defense -- is not appropriate in this case. He said it would not be fair if Pistorius were to live in a luxurious house, get to run track, go to the doctor and then do two days a month of community service. This would be shockingly disproportionate to the crime, he said. He read from case law that said society might lose its trust in the system if a lenient sentence is given. And he accused the defense of ""only paying lip service"" to the gravity of the offense in asking for correctional supervision. If Pistorius had not acted as he did, Steenkamp would be alive today, he said. Pistorius did not have railings in his shower at home, Nel said, as he rejected defense arguments that the accused could not be accommodated properly in prison. He suggested that Pistorius was using his disability ""on call."" Nel also dismissed Pistorius' offers of financial aid to Steenkamp's family. June Steenkamp referred to that money as ""blood money,"" he reminded the court. The court this week heard that the athlete had offered the money to Steenkamp's parents, but they had decided to reject it. They will also pay back a monthly payment he had been making to them. Nel also suggested that any appeal for mercy by Pistorius was undeserved. The interests of the victims far outweigh the personal circumstances of the accused, he said, as he scoffed at the fact that Pistorius could have made millions were it not for the shooting. 'He's lost everything' By contrast, in his final arguments, Roux presented a picture of a ""broken man"" who has already suffered enough. Roux said Pistorius should never have been accused of premeditated murder, a charge of which he was cleared at trial. After the charge, Pistorius was subjected to a trial by media, he said. Roux also argued that he should not have been shown that gruesome picture of the woman he loved while in court. ""He never, ever even considered that it was Steenkamp behind that door,"" Roux said. The athlete has fully accepted the court's verdict and shown remorse, he said. ""He's lost everything. He was an icon in the eyes of South Africans,"" Roux said. ""On what he has done, what he has achieved, he was denigrated to such an extent that all that was left was a raged killer, a cold-blooded killer, a liar and everything that's horrible. ""He lost all his sponsors, he lost all his money. He has nothing, my lady. He hasn't even money to pay for legal expenses. He has nothing left."" He sold his last asset, his car, not to try to get a better sentence but to try to make good by helping the Steenkamp family, Roux said, also citing Pistorius' past charitable work. Roux reminded the court that the Steenkamps have said they are neutral as far as sentencing is concerned and do not seek vengeance. Roux said the testimony of Acting National Commissioner of Correctional Services Zach Modise that Pistorius' disability could be accommodated in the hospital section of a prison did not make it an appropriate place for him to be held. Judge to decide sentence . There is no legal minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law, so it will be down to the judge's discretion. A typical sentence is five to eight years. But it is a principle of South African law that the sentence should be tailored to the culprit as a whole person, as opposed to the crime. That makes predicting a sentence difficult, said Kelly Phelps, a CNN legal analyst. The judge also found Pistorius guilty of one weapons-related charge involving a shooting at a restaurant. The maximum penalty for that is five years behind bars. But he could get a lesser sentence, such as a fine or the loss of his gun license.","NEW: Judge Thokozile Masipa says court will reconvene for sentencing Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Few would argue that football is the planet's true global game. From Baghdad to Buenos Aires it is watched, played, argued about, loved and hated with an intensity that no other sport can match. Its ubiquity also brings a tremendous amount of power. Dictators and politicians have long tried to harness its ability to inspire unity and national pride for more nefarious political purposes -- be it Argentina's junta who used the 1978 World Cup to inspire the kind of loyalty that its regime had failed to do, to current Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who feared and respected football's power to spark change in equal measure. ""[Football] has caused at least one war and many battles, often tragic, off the pitch,"" wrote Melvyn Bragg, nominating the 1863 Rules of Association Football, the football's first official code, in his ""Twelve Books That Changed the World."" But sometimes a single match has been at the center of huge social and political changes. Ahead of the start of the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, CNN gives you some of the games that changed the world. Secretary's XI versus President's XI (1864) When 22 men gathered in Battersea Park, London, in the winter of 1864 for a game of football, no-one could imagine the worldwide sporting revolution that would follow. This was the first game played according to the Rules of Association Football, written by the embryonic English Football Association and the first attempt to unite and codify football's different, not to mention competing, strands. The forward pass hadn't been introduced yet, there were no such thing as crossbars and the offside rule was still three years away from being introduced, but the British Victorian need for imprimatur and order meant that the simplified, slimmed-down rules -- just 13 laws -- were easily exported. Which the British did with a proselytizing zeal throughout its colonies and the rest of the world. One such football missionary was Charles William Miller, who in the mid-1890s took a copy of the rules and a football to Brazil, from where it caught on like wild fire. ""A Brazilian taxi driver told me that Charles Miller had invented football. In other words, he's a legendary figure [in Brazil], but no-one is quite sure what the legend actually is,"" explained Josh Lacey, author of ""God is Brazilian,"" a biography of Miller. ""In Sao Paulo, there is a square named after him. It's the square outside the stadium where Corinthians play."" And the match itself? The Secretary's XI won 2-0, with both goals scored by Charles William Alcock, who would himself go on to organize the very first international fixture, between England and Scotland, seven years later. West Germany versus Hungary (1954) Post-war Germany was a haunted, broken and divided place. Although it was devastated financially by the folly of Nazism and the split between east and west by the emergence of the Iron Curtain, Germans were in a soul-searching funk over their role in the Second World War. The singing of the national anthem was actively discouraged and the country's new, unloved flag was rarely seen. And then came the ""Miracle of Bern"" at the 1954 World Cup, held in Switzerland. Despite being trounced 8-3 in their first match against Hungary, West Germany made it to the final of the World Cup to face the same opposition. The team was made up solely of amateur footballers, while Hungary -- the best team in the world at the time -- boasted the likes of Ferenc Puskas. No-one gave them a chance, but they won 3-2, sparking scenes of jubilation back in West Germany and the first positive, collective nationalistic outburst since the war. ""It was a kind of liberation for the Germans from all the things that weighed down upon them after the Second World War,"" German historian Joachim Fest wrote. ""July 4, 1954 is in certain aspects the founding day of the German Republic."" From there West Germany boomed economically, becoming the leading nation in Europe. As newspaper Der Spiegel pointed out before a united Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup: ""In one 90-minute match against Hungary, modern-day Germany was born."" Rangers versus Bucks (1966) Robben Island is infamous for its most revered prisoner: Nelson Mandela. But the jail, which held what the apartheid South African state viewed to be the most dangerous political prisoners, also gave birth to an unlikely football league. The Makana Football Association was set up by a group of prisoners desperate to break the monotony of prison life. Every week from 1964 onwards a prisoner would ask for permission to play football, and then be punished by the authorities as a result of his temerity. But by 1966 the prison warden relented and a football league was set up based on one of the only books in the prison library: the FIFA rule book. Scores, leagues, disciplinary records and even the results of disciplinary hearings from on-pitch indiscretions were kept, although no record exists of the score between the Rangers and Bucks in the first-ever match. As well as giving the inmates hope during desperate times, the Makana FA had a more important impact: honing the administrative skills of South Africa's future leaders. Jacob Zuma, the current President, was a tough-tackling defender for the Bucks and a future Makana FA referee. ""It taught them administration ... Robben Island created the new generation of people that struggled for freedom,"" explains Professor Chuck Korr, author of ""More Than Just a Game: Football vs. Apartheid."" ""And those men thought football was very important in maintaining their sanity and hope for the future. By definition, football is absolutely essential in the way the struggle for freedom is won."" The Makana FA, although long abandoned, was given honorary FIFA membership in 2007. Dinamo Zagreb versus Red Star Belgrade (1990) Yugoslavia was already on the brink of imploding by the time Serbia's Red Star Belgrade played Croatia's Dinamo Zagreb at the latter's Maksimir Stadium. Pro- independence parties had already won recent Croatian elections. But the events that unfolded on March 13, 1990 are regarded by many as the opening salvo of the most vicious European war since the Nazis were defeated in 1945. During the match, future AC Milan and Croatia captain Zvonimir Boban launched a kung-fu kick at a policeman who was attacking a Zagreb fan. Riots broke out between Zagreb's ""Bad Blue Boys"" ultra group, and Red Star's ""Delije"" -- led by the brutal war-lord Arkan. Arkan's Tiger's, the paramilitary group he ruled during the war, recruited heavily from the Delije. Arkan himself was indicted by the United Nations for war crimes, but was assassinated in 2000 before he stood trial. Later, Boban explained what was going through his head. ""Here I was, a public face prepared to risk his life, career and everything that fame could have brought, all because of one ideal cause: the Croatian cause."" For the rest of the soon-to-be-non-existent country, it was a symbolic moment. ""It was the most important match in Yugoslav history,"" explains Dr. Neven Andjelic, author of ""Bosnia-Herzegovina: The End of a Legacy."" ""It has political implications and is a clear sign of the forthcoming violence and war that this unfinished match provided to the population."" The war went on to rage for five years, with the International Center for Transnational Justice estimating that 140,000 people were killed. Its effects are still evident today, not least outside the Maksimir Stadium, where a statue depicting a group of soldiers stands. On it is the inscription: ""To the fans of the club, who started the war with Serbia at this ground on May 13, 1990."" Iraq versus Saudi Arabia (2007) Younis Mahmoud ran the length of the pitch to celebrate with the handful of fans that had made the long journey to the vast, half-empty stand in Jakarta's Bung Karno stadium. The captain of the Iraq national team -- a team of Kurds, Sunni and Shia Muslims -- had just scored the only, decisive goal in the 2007 Asian Cup final on July 29 against Saudi Arabia, but it meant much more than the first piece of major silverware for the ""Lions of Mesopotamia."" Back in Baghdad, tens of thousands of Iraqis poured into the streets, firing celebratory bullets into the air, with many clutching something that had not been seen in numbers since the fall of Saddam: the Iraqi flag. Football had achieved what no politician or general had managed to achieve: a semblance of national unity. According to the U.S. military, there were 1,700 sectarian attacks in Baghdad alone in June 2007. That had almost halved after the final, to 960 by the end of August. But the victory came at a price. Minutes after Iraq had beaten South Korea in a penalty shoot out in the semifinal, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowd of cheering fans, killing 50 people. At the Asian Cup, the victorious team sat, stunned, in the dressing room and contemplated pulling out of the final. But then the players watched the carnage on television. ""One of the victims was a 12-year-old child,"" recalled Mahmoud to the press afterwards. ""His mother, when his body was laid in front of her, she didn't weep, but she said: 'I present my son as a sacrifice for the Iraqi national team.' We have to win."" They chose to continue, and the rest is history.","The 2011 Asian Cup kicked off in Qatar earlier this month, with 16 teams taking part .

"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony, accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter Caylee in 2008, did not mention the child's disappearance to her boyfriend, any of his roommates or her acquaintances at a nightclub during the month Caylee was missing before police were notified, a handful of witnesses testified Wednesday. The evening of June 16, the last day Caylee was seen, Anthony was ""the way she was every day,"" her then-boyfriend, Anthony Lazzaro, testified. ""Happy. Happy to see me. Having a grand old time."" After that, he said, Anthony started staying at his Orlando apartment daily. At the time, he was living with roommates Cameron Campana, Nathan Lezniewicz and Roy ""Clint"" House. All three men testified that they knew Anthony before she moved in and that they had met Caylee. Caylee's disappearance was not reported to police until July 15. After Anthony moved in, according to testimony, neither Lazzaro nor his roommates saw Caylee again. Anthony has pleaded not guilty to the charges against her and denies harming her daughter or having anything to do with her disappearance. Defense attorney Jose Baez has said that once all the facts are known, it will become clear that his client is not guilty. In addition to capital murder, Anthony, now 25, faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and providing false information to authorities. If she is convicted by the jurors -- seven women and five men -- she could face the death penalty. The Orlando trial, which comes after nearly three years of legal twists, turns and delays, has garnered interest nationwide. The only witness to testify Wednesday besides Lazzaro, his former roommates and House's ex-girlfriend, Maria Kissh, was Brian Burner, the Anthonys' next-door neighbor. Burner testified he was doing yard work outside his house on June 18 when Casey Anthony approached him and asked to borrow a shovel ""to dig up a bamboo root."" He said he gave her the shovel and she went into her family's backyard. He finished his yard work and went inside, he said, adding that she knocked on the door and returned the shovel about an hour later. He said Anthony's demeanor was ""just normal,"" and he couldn't recall that she was sweaty or looked different when she returned the shovel. Burner said he saw Anthony back her car into her parents' garage several times that week but admitted he did not know how or where she usually parked her car. Lazzaro's three roommates testified that after Anthony moved in, she cooked, cleaned and did laundry. They and Lazzaro said she would talk on the phone but would always go outside to do so. But she never mentioned that Caylee was missing, had been kidnapped or that she was looking for her, and she never asked for help, they and Kissh testified. When they asked about the little girl, Anthony told them that Caylee was with her nanny at Universal Studios and that the nanny was taking her to Cocoa Beach, according to testimony. Kissh said Anthony told her she was paying the nanny $400 a week, and Anthony told her Caylee's father was deceased. In the early days of the investigation, Anthony said the nanny, who she said was named Zenaida Gonzalez and nicknamed ""Zanny,"" had kidnapped Caylee. Authorities were never able to find the woman. Lazzaro and his roommates testified that the times they saw Anthony with her daughter, the little girl did not appear to be mistreated, abused or neglected and that Anthony appeared to be a caring mother. Kissh, however, recalled one occasion when she went to the apartment to see House, and Caylee -- whom she had never seen before -- answered the door. Anthony and Lazzaro were back in his bedroom, and she was left alone with Caylee for 20 minutes or so, she said. As Kissh and House were leaving, she testified, Anthony came out and told Caylee to put her shoes on, as they were also leaving. Kissh said she helped Caylee put on her shoes and socks after she noticed the girl ""struggling."" The testimony came a day after Baez dropped bombshell allegations in his opening statement. Baez said that Caylee was not murdered, but drowned in the pool belonging to Anthony's parents, George and Cindy Anthony, on June 16. Casey and George Anthony panicked upon finding the child dead, Baez said. Baez dropped another bombshell when explaining Anthony's behavior in the month before Caylee was reported missing on July 15 -- partying at clubs and lying about the child's whereabouts. He said Anthony was sexually abused by her father starting at age 8, and was ""hiding her pain,"" as she had been taught from an early age to behave as if nothing was wrong. However, in his testimony, George Anthony, the trial's first witness, denied ever sexually abusing his daughter. He also said he was not at his home when Caylee died. ""If I'd have known something happened to Caylee, we wouldn't be here today,"" he said. As a former police officer, he said, he was trained in CPR and would have done everything possible to save his granddaughter's life if he found her in the pool as Baez alleged. Baez also alleged Tuesday that Casey Anthony was inappropriately touched by her brother, Lee, although ""it didn't go as far"" as it had with her father. It was bad enough, however, he said, that the FBI conducted a paternity test to see if Lee Anthony had fathered Caylee. He told jurors the Anthony family ""keeps its secrets quiet. ... You're going to hear all kinds of bizarre family behavior."" On Wednesday, pictures of Anthony, Lezniewicz and Lazzaro at the Fusion Ultra Lounge nightclub were introduced into evidence by prosecutors, over Baez's objections. The others testified about partying with her at nightclubs, including her participation in a ""hot body"" contest on one occasion. Two women who worked as ""shot girls,"" selling alcoholic shots to club patrons, testified Wednesday that Anthony was a sort of overseer, telling them where to be and looking out for them to make sure they weren't harmed. One, Jamie Realander, said that Anthony, in a conversation on July 15, hours before Anthony's mother reported the child missing, told her for the first time about her daughter, and invited her to Caylee's birthday party the following month. Realander said she received a text message the following day asking for help in finding the little girl. The other, Erica Gonzalez, testified that Anthony made a remark in passing about having a daughter, but didn't know the child's name or age. Realander and Gonzalez said Anthony never told them Caylee was missing in the 31 days before her disappearance was reported. Baez asked Campana and Lezniewicz the same question: Whether they were present at the Anthony home on June 16 when Caylee allegedly drowned in the pool. Both men said they were not. Baez attempted to ask Lazzaro whether Anthony had told him she was sexually abused by her father, but Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. sustained prosecutors' objections and would not let Lazzaro answer the question. Meanwhile on Wednesday, the attorney for meter reader Roy Kronk, who found Caylee's skeletal remains in December 2008, issued a second statement denying Baez's Tuesday allegations that Kronk had found the remains in an unknown location and moved them to where they were later discovered in an attempt to cash in on the high-profile case. ""The suggestion that Mr. Kronk took possession of Caylee's remains is totally lacking in logic or explanation,"" attorney David Evans said. ""It did not happen."" Kronk has been truthful with authorities, he said, and ""the defense team has tried repeatedly to cast Roy Kronk in the role of bad guy, even to the extent of making statements about him on national television that they knew to be false."" After Tuesday's court session, an attorney for George and Cindy Anthony issued a statement responding to the claims Baez made during his opening remarks. ""George and Cindy Anthony are shocked and appalled that the defense would resort to lies about them in today's opening statement. Baez's idle speculation today certainly are not facts. The only result achieved by the defense in this statement was to further hurt this grieving family,"" Orlando attorney Mark Lippman said in the written statement. ""George Anthony maintains that he never had anything to do with the death of Caylee Marie Anthony including what happened to her remains after she allegedly drowned,"" Lippman added. In an appearance later Tuesday on HLN's ""Nancy Grace,"" Lippman was more pointed in his remarks, saying Baez's accusations were ""all just fiction. His opening (statement) was fiction, and there's nowhere to go with it."" ''Everything he (Baez) said about George was a complete and utter lie, and I am, for one, very proud of my client for being able to sit there as he did and just be able to take what was said about him without showing the reaction that I felt myself on his behalf,'' Lippman added. Earlier Tuesday, prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick told jurors in her opening statement that while it may be difficult to accept that a mother could kill her own child, there is no other conclusion that can be drawn, based on the evidence. ""No one but Casey Anthony had access to all the pieces of evidence in this case,"" Burdick said. ""... No one else lied to their friends, to their family, to investigators. No one else benefited from the death of Caylee Marie Anthony. Caylee's death allowed Casey Anthony to live the good life -- at least for 31 days.""

"(CNN) -- Earlier this month, Kenyans commemorated the heinous attack on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi. That dark September day last year claimed the lives of 67 people, hailing from more than a dozen countries. Now, as the international community mobilizes to act against terrorists in the Middle East, it would do well to remember the lessons of the Westgate tragedy. Of those that executed last year's attack, at least two were foreign fighters drawn from the ranks of those who came to fight alongside Al-Shabaab in Somalia. With this in mind, it is clear that foreign fighters must be met by states acting in concert, sharing resources and knowledge. Terrorist organizations are constantly evolving, taking advantage of political and sectarian factors, as well as vacuums in governance. And while the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is capturing the headlines today, its rise is being watched and matched elsewhere. Indeed, before ISIS, there was the effective merger of Al-Shabaab and al Qaeda, which led to increased movement of fighters and weapons to Somalia. Any response to groups like ISIS, then, must be similarly joined up, taking into account all potential hotspots and breeding grounds for extremism. Perhaps the most important lesson for all countries focused on countering extremists is that young people need to be given the tools and knowledge required to repulse those who seek to radicalize and then recruit them into such networks. In Kenya, for example, we have seen some of our young men and women lured into Somalia for training before returning to try to strike their home country. How are terrorists able to turn these young people toward extremism? Beyond the effective use of the Internet, such as has been displayed by ISIS, we have seen sophisticated appropriation of civil spaces like religious and educational institutions as well as refugee camps. This, combined with an ability to manipulate the narratives of group marginalization and oppression, has left too many vulnerable to the lure of radicalism. This cannot be allowed to continue. In Kenya, we are striving to do more to help young people find the economic opportunities that will help them shun those looking to recruit them to extremism. Just as importantly, we want young Kenyans to understand the vital role they play in nurturing democracy so they can appreciate that even those not on the front line against terrorism have a role to play in fighting for good government and prosperity. The reality is that our longstanding friendship with the West and our choice of democracy enrages the terrorists as it offers an appealing alternative to their ideology of division and bitterness. The path of democracy and security is not a simple or quick one, but Kenya is grateful for its ties with the United States, and the example it has provided in standing against the terrorists. But it is time to do even more, together, while we have momentum on our side. The fragile security environment in Somalia still affords international terrorists a haven from which to launch their attacks. Kenya, with others in the region, such as the Somali National Army, is continuing its campaign to degrade and destroy Al-Shabaab, and to secure a peaceful Somalia. Robust support for the African Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) operations and stabilization efforts is vital to securing Somalia and denying the fighters operational space. With this in mind, we strongly urge expanded support for AMISOM, particularly in enabling ready access to air and maritime support. And it is also time to further expand our efforts against radicalization and recruitment. Together, the global community must hold the enablers of this process accountable, including by exposing and disabling the illicit financial flows that oil the wheels of radicalization. Even as we expand our democracies, we must demand high levels of transparency and responsibility from all institutions -- civil, commercial or governmental -- that are in a position to feed the foreign fighter and terrorist ranks. These efforts must take place within a wider strategy that encompasses all states, and the recent African Union Peace and Security Council Summit on Terrorism and Violent Extremism in Africa was a good example of the region coming together to address the threat within our midst. East Africa, meanwhile, is also deepening security cooperation in concrete ways, even as we integrate our region. It is true that we cannot deny that Kenya has paid a heavy price for the values and allies we have adopted -- Westgate is just one example of that. But the choices we have made on standing up against extremism have been the right ones. Kenya is meeting its responsibilities in the global war against terrorism. I hope that our allies will continue to stand by us and support us in a fight in which we all have a stake.","Kenya has been marking a year since the Westgate Mall attack, which claimed 67 lives .

"(CNN) -- The brutal murders of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three American diplomatic staffers in Benghazi underscore the profound fragility of U.S. relations in the region. It is hard to recall a time when crises such as this and in the Middle East afflicted so many American interests simultaneously, nor one in which U.S. policies were so deeply at risk. The tragic events in eastern Libya themselves represent the culmination of events that began and unfolded well outside the mainstream of Libyan life or the U.S. relationship with that country. An obscure filmmaker in Los Angeles produced a slapdash video that was seized upon by an extremist group of Americans who have in the past distinguished themselves for the toxic cocktail of hate and stupidity that drives their actions. Via the special contagion of the Internet, their vileness, which once would have been as hidden from view as it deserved to be, triggered protests at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. Opinion: What terrorists want us to believe about Libya . U.S. sources told CNN on Wednesday that the Benghazi attack was planned in advance, and the attackers used the film protest outside the consulate as a diversion. The sources could not say whether the attackers instigated the protest or merely took advantage of it, and they say they don't believe ambassador Chris Stevens was specifically targeted. But targeted or not, the victims were American diplomats who had willingly undertaken the risky mission of trying to assist the advent of democracy in that faraway place. This violence underscores that deep hatreds lie just beneath the surface across the region, even in countries where relations with the United States have had important positive dimensions, either recently or over an extended period. The problems run deep for the region and U.S. President Barack Obama's administration. First, the riots and violence illustrate that the broader political circumstances in the countries of the Arab Spring remain unresolved and potentially vulnerable to serious disruption from even small opposition groups. The Morsi government, slow to condemn the Egypt attacks Tuesday, has itself been unsettled by violence across the country in the past couple of months. Second, however, these are hardly the only tensions bubbling over in the greater Middle East and South Asia. The situation in Syria not only is worsening daily but is spilling over as refugees seek haven in Jordan and Turkey. The Iraqi government, increasingly undependable as a friend of the United States, has allowed Iranian aid flights to Damascus despite U.S. protests. Afghan allies are turning on U.S. troops with alarming regularity. The State Department just underscored the increasing threat from Pakistani extremist groups by finally citing the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani network as a terrorist group. But perhaps the fault line of greatest concern to the Obama team, even as the bad news was filtering out of Benghazi, is the standoff with Iran regarding its nuclear program and the deterioration in the relationship between the United States and Israel, historically our closest ally in the region. Libya, West react to killings, film controversy . The U.S.-Israeli relationship reached a new low on Tuesday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu angrily reacting to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's assertion that Washington would not specify ""red lines"" regarding Iran's nuclear program; and then the Israelis leaking word that Obama refused to meet with him during the upcoming U.N. General Assembly meetings in New York. This resulted in a late-night call between Obama and Netanyahu that was ostensibly intended to show the allies were communicating and acting in tandem. But the White House denied the Israelis had even requested a meeting with Obama in New York, revealing the depth of the problem. When allies can't agree even on what they disagree about, the relationship is in trouble. Both sides are scrambling to do damage control -- and behind the scenes are fuming. Neither feels like the other is behaving like a friend. That's because there are very real differences between the leadership groups in both countries, and this complicates a tough situation. Every sign of tension and every delay plays into Iran's hands and enables it to advance further with nuclear weapons development. These deepening tensions keep the Obama team -- desperate to avoid an October surprise before November's elections -- scrambling with high-level meetings and planning high-level trips to the region, and reveal similar risks for the campaign of Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Romney on Tuesday issued a prepared release condemning the Obama team's handling of the Egypt and Libya violence. It was almost instantly overtaken by the news of the deaths in Benghazi, making the Romney critique seem ugly. It was ill-considered and ill-timed, and underscores that in presidential campaigns, no candidate gets to pick the stories that drive the headlines -- and that foreign policy often crops up to complicate matters and test a candidate's real readiness. Romney, with his earlier comments on Russia and in Israel regarding Palestinians, reveal he needs more temperate counsel. Headline-grabbing and statesmanship seldom go together, as demonstrated in the past 24 hours by the war of words between Israel and the U.S. and in Romney's misstep. In fragile times and when longer term interests are at stake, restraint goes a long way. The best work is often done quietly, behind the scenes. It is done by people like Ambassador Chris Stevens, his colleagues who also died and those that remain on the ground in Libya and across the region. They understood that they were taking on considerable risks, as did their government. They did so willingly, because they knew it was only through accepting those risks and making a long-term commitment to the region that progress could be achieved. That must be their legacy and it is a message that needs to be heard and understood by the American people before they overreact one way or another to each or any of the current crises. Indeed, it is in times like these we must emulate in our policies the best qualities of the lives they led.","David Rothkopf: The murders at U.S. Embassy in Libya show fragility of U.S.-Mideast relations .

"Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- Gulf coast residents braced Saturday for the arrival of a massive oil slick creeping toward shore as nearly a million feet of boom were deployed in an effort to protect precious estuaries and wildlife -- even as thousands of barrels of crude continued gushing into the water. Landfall along the Mississippi River Delta and other Gulf areas was expected as early as Saturday. ""I'm pretty much on pause right now ... it's just a big waiting game,"" said David Boola, a fisherman who leads boat trips for tourists out of Venice, Louisiana. But even as officials and residents wait for the oil to reach land, the slick has already taken a dramatic toll on life all along the Gulf Coast, bringing fishing and tourism to a halt in many places and threatening to cripple those industries for weeks to come. ""I'm extremely worried because I have customers that [have] already canceled trips,"" Boola told CNN Saturday. ""I should be out taking people fishing today and I'm not. I'm not making money today. Or tomorrow. I'm worried about the now factor, you know?"" Government leaders echoed those fears. ""The oil that is leaking offshore, the oil that is coming onto our coast threatens more than just our wildlife, our fisheries, our coast,"" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said at a Saturday press conference. ""This oil literally threatens our way of life."" The oil company BP -- which operated the rig whose sinking caused the underwater oil gusher -- partnered with government officials to hold town hall meetings throughout the region Saturday to respond to concern about the spill's consequences. But frustration was growing Saturday in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. At a town hall meeting in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, Mayor Stan Wright warned fishermen in the audience that outbursts would be met with arrest. The fishermen were told that they were not allowed to ask questions. Jindal suggested the response to the oil slick has so far been inadequate, saying ""we continue to be concerned with BP's ability to respond to this incident."" Jindal said he has been working with local officials to develop cleanup contingency plans, but needs funding approval from BP and authorization from the U.S. Coast Guard's incident commander to move forward. ""We need to empower our locals on the ground,"" he said. ""Now they're saying we are seeing sheens,"" hitting the coast, Jindal said Saturday, citing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""But they expect the heavier oil to be coming by tomorrow and Monday."" U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Thad Allen -- who the Obama administration designated Saturday to lead response to the oil slick -- said that oil is likely to reach shorelines in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. ""The real question is when,"" he said. Allen said Saturday that the government and BP's top priority is trying to stop the oil leak, but offered no timetable for when that goal might be achieved. ""We don't know how many days the discharge will continue to occur,"" he said. Such reports darkened forecasts about the spill's environmental impact. ""This has the potential of being truly devastating,"" Tom McKenzie, of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told CNN. Environmentalist Richard Charter of the Defenders of Wildlife organization said the magnitude of the oil leak could cause damage that would last decades. ""This event is a self-feeding fire,"" Charter told CNN. ""It is so big and expanding so fast that it's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective. ... You're looking at a long-term poisoning of the area. Ultimately, this will have a multi-decade impact."" President Obama announced he will visit the oil spill area Sunday morning. The oil spill started April 20, after an explosion on the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven oil rig workers remain missing and are presumed dead. The rig sank April 22 about 50 miles (80 km) off the southeast coast of Louisiana, and the untapped wellhead is gushing about 5,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico, according to BP and government estimates. Some environmentalists say the amount could be much larger. About 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion, the Coast Guard said. BP said two Louisiana communities -- Venice and Port Fourchon -- will be the first places likely hit by the oil slick. Nearly 2,000 personnel have joined the response effort, which includes 68 vessels, among them skimmers, tugs, barges and oil-recovery ships, officials said. Crews worked through Friday night to dispense 3,000 gallons of sub-surface dispersant, officials said. The Coast Guard's Allen said that an initial test of dispersant released near the wellhead suggested the method could ""significantly mitigate the amount [of oil] that makes it to the surface."" Such tests have never been done before, BP spokeswoman Marti Powers said. She said that the dispersants attach themselves to underwater concentrations of oil, causing the oil to sink to the bottom and dissipate. While the dispersants can help dissipate oil slicks and help birds and other land-based or water-surface wildlife, the chemicals can hurt fish and other underwater species, environmentalist Charter said. ""The scale of the event and the likely duration of the event ... really leaves responders with no good options,"" Charter said. ""While [dispersants] can protect terrestial wildlife ... out in the ocean they make toxic biocomponents available to the marine food chain."" Rapid response teams are staged to deploy to shorelines affected by the oil, federal officials said Saturday. The teams will evaluate and determine an appropriate clean-up effort to minimize impact on the environment. In addition, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has approved Jindal's request to mobilize 6,000 National Guard troops. Meanwhile, the Minerals Management Service has been in contact with all oil and gas operators in the oil spill area, officials said. Two platforms have stopped production and one has been evacuated as a safety measure, federal officials said in a release Saturday morning. Federal officials have urged BP to beef up its response. ""We'll continue to urge BP to leverage additional assets,"" Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said Friday as she toured the area. ""It is time for BP to supplement their current mobilization as the slick of oil moves toward shore."" Doug Suttles, chief operating officer of BP, said the company has had three priorities: stop the flow of oil, minimize its impact and keep the public informed. ""We've so far mounted the largest response effort ever done in the world,"" Suttles said. ""We've utilized every technology available, we've applied every resource request. ... We welcome every new idea and every offer of support."" BP said it has been trying to stop the flow by using remote-controlled submarines to activate a valve atop the well. But the valve is not working, the energy company said. As concerns about the spill's toll mount -- particularly in the commercial fishing industry, a critical $2.4 billion economic engine for the region -- Obama promised steps to prevent a similar disaster in the future. The president asked Interior Secretary Ken Salazar ""to conduct a thorough review of this incident and report back to me in 30 days on what, if any, additional precautions and technologies should be required to prevent accidents like this from happening again."" Federal officials, including the president, emphasized that BP is legally responsible for paying the costs of the response to and cleanup of the spill. The cause of the blast on the Deepwater Horizon remains unknown. Seventeen of the 126 people on the rig were injured in the blast, three of them critically. One person remained hospitalized Saturday, federal officials said. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is investigating. CNN's Arthur Brice and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","NEW: Fishing and tourism grind to a halt in many places .

"(CNN) -- On average, 18 people in the United States die each day waiting for an organ transplant. Billionaire Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg wants to change that. He announced Tuesday that the social networking site wants to ""help solve the crisis"" by allowing users to volunteer as potential organ donors in the United States and the United Kingdom. ""We think that a lot of people who might just be on the fence about whether or not they want to do this, could be convinced to do that,"" Zuckerberg told ABC News. He described widespread acceptance of organ donation as ""a shift in society that will probably take a while to fully take hold"" until more Facebook users start sharing their experiences. ""But I think that if people choose to share these stories with their friends, that can make a big difference over time."" CNN's Elizabeth Cohen: Each donor can save seven lives . More than 114,000 people in the United States are awaiting organ donations, 79 people on an average day receive a transplant while 18 die, according to Organdonor.gov. The site says more than 100 million people in the U.S. are registered donors. ""We could save thousands more lives a year if we had another 20, 30, 40 million more people registered,"" said David Fleming, president and CEO of Donate Life America, which is partnering with Facebook in this effort. The Facebook tool works like this: Users go to their timelines, where under Life Event they will see a health and wellness section. Zuckerberg said: ""You put in, 'I decided to be an organ donor' and your state or country you live in and you can add a story about how you decided to be an organ donor."" More than 10,000 people in the United Kingdom need a transplant, according to the website for NHS Blood and Transplant. A Facebook user will also see a Share Your Donor Status link when a friend's donor update hits their news feed. The Facebook page also includes links to Donate Life America for people to become official donors. Going through an online state registry or indicating you want to be a donor when you get your driver's license means signing a legal agreement, unlike the Facebook pledge. ""The Facebook partnership is an opportunity for people to share decisions,"" Fleming said. ""The most important part of this is actually registering to be a donor so that your wishes can be carried out. Sharing that decision through Facebook is an opportunity to encourage your friends and family to also register."" People have shared their desire to donate their organs on Facebook before, and others have talked about their need for a transplant, but the idea isn't to match these people, Fleming said. Promoting social agendas hasn't been a big tradition at Facebook, although in 2011 it did pair with CNN's sister company, Cartoon Network, to rally against bullying. There have been several other initiatives. ""Encouraging users to share that they are organ donors is another simple and non-controversial move Facebook can make to add value to the service beyond the traditional status updates and photo sharing,"" wrote Brittany Darwell, lead writer at the blog Inside Facebook, in an e-mail to CNN. She said Facebook has also been involved with finding places to vote in national elections, issuing Amber Alerts through some pages, as well as joining a group of companies to promote world peace. Anne Paschke, a spokeswoman for the United Network for Organ Sharing, applauded the organ donation plan. ""It's absolutely fabulous that so many people will learn how easy it is to sign up to be an organ, eye and tissue donor,"" she said. Organdonor.gov also recommends that people who want to be donors inform family members, tell their doctors and include this wish in their wills. Facebook has 161 million users in the United States, spokeswoman Sarah Feinberg said in an e-mail. She said the company didn't have solid numbers on how many people had used the organ donation tool yet.

"New York (CNN) -- The WTC Captive Insurance Co. announced settlements Thursday with more than 10,000 plaintiffs who claimed sickness or injuries after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The settlements could total up to $657 million. WTC Captive was created with a $1 billion FEMA grant and provides insurance coverage to the City of New York and its debris-removal contractors. In the aftermath of attacks of September 11, 2001, New York was unable to get adequate amounts of liability insurance for the rescue, recovery and debris-removal work done at the World Trade Center site. The settlement would provide a system to pay for the compensation of the injury claims made by people working on the rescue and debris removal for the city and its contractors. This would include construction workers, firefighters, police officers and other workers and volunteers. The settlement would also fund a special insurance policy, which provides additional compensation to any plaintiff contracting certain types of cancer in the future. Christine LaSala, president of WTC Captive, said in a statement: ""We have reached a settlement that is fair under difficult and complicated circumstances. This agreement enables workers and volunteers claiming injury from the WTC site operations to obtain compensation commensurate with the nature of their injuries and the strength of their claims, while offering added protection against possible future illness."" In order to make a claim, plaintiffs will have to submit proof they were present and participated in the post-9/11 efforts. They will also have to present specific medical documentation, including a diagnosis confirming their illness or injury. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said of the resolution, ""This settlement is a fair and reasonable resolution to a complex set of circumstances. Since September 11th, the city has moved aggressively to provide medical treatment to those who were present at Ground Zero, and we will continue our commitment to treatment and monitoring."" A spokesman for the mayor declined further comment. After the 9/11 attacks, individuals who worked or volunteered in the rescue, recovery and debris-removal project were entitled to and have received free medical care, which has been funded by the City of New York and the federal government. Participating in the settlement would not deter access to that care. Former New York firefighter Kenny Specht told CNN's Campbell Brown, ""You really can't put a price on your health, so I hope that this settlement was done the right way and I hope that it was done with people's health and safety and future in mind."" Specht, 37, was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2008.","WTC Captive Insurance Co. announced settlements with more than 10,000 plaintiffs .

"(CNN) -- The 2014 Emmy nominations were announced on Thursday, with ""Game of Thrones"" in the lead with a total of 19 nods, and ""Breaking Bad"" getting its final round of recognition. The announcement, made by Mindy Kaling and ""The Voice's"" Carson Daly, revealed strong competition but few surprises, with series like ""True Detective"" and ""Orange Is the New Black"" getting their expected (and deserved) due. Here's what else we learned from the 2014 Emmy nominations (See the list of nominations here): . 1. So many dramas, so little room . This year's drama category name-checks some of the predicted suspects -- ""Breaking Bad,"" ""House of Cards,"" ""Mad Men"" -- while welcoming a new player: HBO's ""True Detective."" The show's inclusion in the category was controversial, since the program is structured more like a miniseries: its second season will tell a new story with a new cast of characters. But HBO submitted it as a drama, and Emmy voters clearly responded -- evidently more than they did for ""Homeland,"" the Showtime series that was once the belle of the Emmys ball. (Last year, 13 nominations. This year? A total of four.) Yet even with such a strong cast of nominees, fans of ""Orphan Black,"" The Americans"" and ""The Walking Dead"" are somewhere bemoaning the Emmys' oversight of those series once again. 2. Netflix's seat at the table is a lock . What a difference a year makes. With the 2013 Emmys, Netflix was the new kid on the block, breaking ground with its nominations for its shining original series, ""House of Cards."" But in 2014, the streaming service has locked down 31 nominations, including a nod to Ricky Gervais for outstanding lead actor in a comedy in his new show, ""Derek."" 3. Plenty of fresh faces -- but where's Tatiana Maslany? With so many first-timers included in the Emmy nominations this year, we would've guessed that ""Orphan Black's"" star Tatiana Maslany would've been among them, for sure. But no, it looks like the talented actress -- who's been receiving praise from The New York Times to Variety to, yes, CNN -- has been passed over once again. CNN 10 Fresh Faces: Tatiana Maslany and more . Here's some good news, though: the Emmys didn't forget ""Masters of Sex"" star Lizzy Caplan, or Lena Headey (""Game of Thrones""), or Taylor Schilling and Kate Mulgrew (""Orange Is The New Black""). Plus, newcomers like FX's miniseries ""Fargo"" got plenty of love: it was right behind ""Game of Thrones"" for most nominations, with 18. 4. From the Oscars to the Emmys . As if we needed more proof that some of the best work is being done on TV, two of the standout nominees this year are fresh off their stint at the Oscars in March. Chiwetel Ejiofor, who was nominated for best actor at the 2014 Oscars for ""12 Years A Slave,"" has picked up his first Emmy nomination for the miniseries ""Dancing on the Edge."" And Matthew McConaughey, a.k.a. the guy who just won the best actor Oscar with ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" is nominated for an outstanding dramatic actor Emmy with ""True Detective."" He'll compete in that category with his co-star, Woody Harrelson, but if McConaughey wins, he'll become the first actor to win both an Oscar and an Emmy in the same year. 5. The comedy nominees are no laughing matter . ""Modern Family"" has been the favorite in the outstanding comedy series category for the past four years, but this year the ABC stalwart faces competition from both ""Orange Is the New Black"" and ""Silicon Valley,"" both of which have earned their fair share of applause. And when it comes to the best lead actress in a comedy, everyone's hoping this will be Amy Poehler's year.

"(CNN) -- It took a lot of effort for Leo Bonten to turn his amputated leg into a fully functional lamp. For starters, he had to break the damn thing in a freak kiddie pool accident. As one does. Seriously. That's how it all started, thus confirming what I've always said: ""Kiddie pools are not toys, and should only be used as giant, outdoor toilets."" I chose that as my high school yearbook quote over ""Carpe diem."" But it really happened. In July 2012, the unfortunate Dutchman suffered a terrible break while goofing off with his cousin in south Rotterdam. Over time, the leg became infected, ignored, and more infected to the point where, in July of this year, doctors had to remove it surgically. So, Bonten, now 53, settled in to the fact that he would be losing his right leg -- a harsh reality for an otherwise healthy and active man. But it was damaged beyond repair, and there was nothing he could do. Except, you know, maybe ask to keep it. ""It's my leg,"" he told me over the phone. ""It's my legal right."" Sort of. We'll get to that. Either way, he asked for it, which I'm sure lead to a rather awkward, if not spirited, conversation with hospital administrators. ""Sir, we just can't give it to you."" ""Right. Well, what if I bring in my own tin foil?"" Generally speaking, hospitals use very specific protocol with amputations. For safety and sanitation reasons, they're usually required to incinerate them. Body parts can also be buried during some sort of official funeral (and, perhaps, exhumed) with proper legal oversight. But that was an expensive option, and not one Bonten was able to afford. Though, probably worth it just to see the face of the grave digger. ""Don't go anywhere, Dave. And hold on to that shovel."" So, Bonten wouldn't be doing that. There would be no funeral. Still, he wanted his leg, for he had a crazy idea. He would turn it into a lamp. Sort of like the one from Ralphie's house in ""A Christmas Story."" But real. And significantly more severed. Thus, Bonten and the hospital entered a complicated period of legal negotiations, where they finally came to a mutual agreement after a strange set of circumstances. You see, leading up to his surgery at Erasmus Medical Center, a news reporter gave Bonten a book by Joris van Casteren about a mysterious leg found by a fisherman in the IJssel River. That book led Bonten to a pathologist named Frank van de Goot, who was more than happy to help with all this lamp nonsense. You see, as per his profession, van de Goot was able to legally obtain Bonten's leg from the hospital after surgery. Thus, the leg was then couriered to van de Goot as specified by the law. He would inspect it. He would study it. And, ultimately, he would preserve the leg with chemicals so it could remain ... a leg. Problem solved. Almost. Someone still had to make it into a lamp. Eventually, as Bonten's story became an even bigger media sensation, a designer named William Schaper Kotter decided to reach out and offer his services to complete the vision. This thing was actually going to happen. And now it's done. They made a lamp out of his leg. Today, the leg sits suspended in a glass cylinder filled with a solution. Surrounding that cylinder are metal bars, symbolizing two years of physical ""imprisonment"" suffered by Bonten while the leg deteriorated. Above that is an empty space. This represents the rehab period. And on the top sits a large remote-controlled LED light, flanked by two metal wings, honoring Bonten's upcoming freedom from the help of a new limb. Which is where the story takes another twist. The issue of the prosthetic. Bonten explained to me that the one he's getting through his insurance is not top of the line. Quite simply, he wants something better. Something stronger. Something more agile. Because, before all this, he played soccer. He ran. He boxed. It was one silly accident that changed everything. But a high-tech prosthetic will cost him. So, he decided to sell his lamp on eBay for â‚¬100,000 -- an endeavor that lasted not even two days before the online bidding site rejected his listing. You can't sell human parts on eBay. On the plus side, you CAN sell used socks. Don't ask me why I was looking. Just know that you can. So, until somebody comes to him with an offer, Bonten will just keep it at home, where he just returned after a lengthy stint in rehab. His lamp will arrive on Sunday, and he'll finally be re-united with his leg. ""My leg is amputated,"" he says, fully understanding the humor and absurdity in all this. ""But it gives me a good feeling that I still have it."" And if he wants to cover the foot with a dirty, used sock ... sadly, I know just the place. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter. And prepare to be underwhelmed. See more content with questionable news value at CNN Comedy.","Leo Bonten broke his leg in a backyard accident in Rotterdam .

"(CNN) -- Days after a photo of him casting his final presidential vote captured the hearts of thousands and went viral online, World War II veteran Frank Tanabe died Wednesday. A week ago, the terminally ill 93-year-old's absentee ballot arrived in the mail. Tanabe had been in the final stages of inoperable liver cancer and was at home in Honolulu receiving hospice care. But he had never missed a presidential election, and he wasn't about to let his illness deter him from voting this time around, his daughters said. After his absentee ballot arrived, his daughter, Barbara, sat at his bedside and read aloud the candidates and issues. ""I helped him. He either nodded 'yes' or shook his head 'no,' "" Barbara told CNN earlier this week. ""He didn't always vote for my candidate."" Nonetheless, she said she followed his directions and mailed in the completed form. Irene, Frank's other daughter, knew that she was witnessing a rare moment and snapped a picture of the event. She first posted it on Facebook, then her 26-year-old son, Noah, lifted it and posted it on the link sharing site Reddit. From there, it went viral. Barbara said she told her dad about all of the Internet ""buzz"" and was sure he was ""thrilled about it"" He was ""very patriotic, very proud,"" she said, adding that her father instilled a similar sense of appreciation to his children. In 2010, he was among a group of Japanese-Americans who were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal as part of the Military Intelligence Service Unit during World War II. Originally from the Seattle area, Tanabe enrolled at the University of Washington during World War II but was forced to drop out when he and the rest of his family were placed in internment camps for the Japanese in the U.S. From there, Tanabe volunteered for the U.S. Army, knowing that Japanese-English translators were in need. His family members remained in the camp while he served. ""He always told us it was very important to vote, because he saw his comrades in arms fight and die for American rights,"" Barbara said. Among those, she added, was the right to vote.","A photo of Frank Tanabe voting went viral online .

"(CNN) -- The world is seeing sobering signs of climate change's accelerating impacts, from longer, more intense droughts to stronger storms and rising seas. Yet in contrast to the slow pace of international negotiations to combat climate change, national legislation is advancing at a startling rate, a surprise to those who ascribe to the conventional wisdom that progress has waned. Remarkably, since 1997, almost 500 climate-related laws have been passed in 66 countries covering around 88% of global greenhouse gases released by human activities. This surprising legislative momentum is happening across all continents. Encouragingly, this progress is being led by the big emerging and developing countries, such as China and Mexico, that together will represent 8 billion of the projected 9 billion people on Earth in 2050. These are the key findings of the 4th edition of the GLOBE Climate Legislation Study, released on Thursday 27 February, the only compendium of climate legislative action created by legislators from around the world, and the most comprehensive audit yet of the extent and breadth of the emerging legislative response to climate change. Our message is that we believe national legislation should be at the heart of a new international agreement to tackle climate change, and this study is proof it can be achieved in every country. While optimistic, we must also be honest. These laws are not yet enough to limit global average temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the level scientists say we must not breach if we are to avoid the worst risks of climate change. Yet these actions are putting into place the legal frameworks necessary to measure, report, verify and manage greenhouse gas emissions -- the cause of man-made climate change. Part of the reason for this spectacular wave of progress is changing attitudes. Previously, the debate on climate change was framed by a narrative about sharing a global burden -- with governments naturally trying to minimize their share. Now, however, countries are seeing mitigating climate change -- through clean energy and energy efficiency solutions -- and strengthening resilience to its impacts, as being firmly in the national interest. For example, 61 of the 66 countries in the GLOBE study have passed laws to promote domestic, clean sources of energy and 54 have legislated to increase energy efficiency. The former reduces reliance on imported fossil fuels, thereby mitigating exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices, increasing energy security and reducing energy poverty. The latter reduces costs and increases competitiveness. That's why the first bill U.S. Senator Markey introduced was to do both. And it's no surprise, too, that 52 out of the 66 countries covered by the study have developed legislation to improve their resilience to the impacts of climate change, some of which we are already experiencing. Opinion: Why are we still debating climate change? As the formal U.N. negotiations move towards Paris in 2015, the scheduled conclusion of negotiations on a post-2020 framework, this legislation is creating a strong foundation on which a post-2020 global agreement can be built. Moreover, it is increasingly clear that not only is the agreement in Paris dependent on national legislation in place in advance, implementation of the Paris agreement will only be effective through national laws, overseen by well-informed legislators from all sides of the political spectrum. A national ""commitment"" or ""contribution"" put forward at the U.N. will only be credible -- and durable beyond the next election -- if it is backed up by national legislation, supported by cross-party legislators, that puts in place a credible set of policies and measures to ensure effective implementation. That is why legislators must be at the center of international negotiations and policy processes, not just on climate change, but also on the full range of sustainable development issues. And it is why, on climate change, governments must immediately prioritize supporting the implementation of national legislation between now and 2015. GLOBE members recognize this and have been at the forefront of developing the legislative response to climate change. In 2008 UK members shaped and strengthened the Climate Change Act. In 2009, South Korean members passed ""Green Growth"" legislation. In 2013, members in Micronesia were instrumental in the passage of climate-related legislation showing the power of island voices. A comprehensive climate change law is expected to pass in Costa Rica this year, and members in China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Peru, amongst others, are developing legislation now. However, we need to do much more. And that is why, in collaboration with the World Bank and the United Nations, GLOBE is launching the ""Partnership for Climate Legislation"" to promote the advance of climate-related laws. Of course, the role of legislators does not end when legislation is passed. It is one thing to pass legislation and another to implement it. That is why GLOBE is equipping legislators to be as effective as possible in holding their governments to account. This is crucial if the agreement made in Paris in 2015 is to deliver. Legislators -- with their formal responsibilities on legislation and oversight - are a fundamental part of an effective strategy to tackle the world's environmental and sustainable development challenges. To maximize the chances of success, they must be at the center of all international processes and negotiations. Success in Paris to create a climate agreement, the follow-through to implement the accord, and the fate of our planet depend on our actions.","World seeing sobering signs of climate change's accelerating impacts, say politicians .

"(CNN) -- It was a scare no one aboard the Halloween horror cruise expected. A jolt shook the Bahamas Celebration cruise Friday night after the ship hit something at sea, forcing hundreds of costume-clad passengers to evacuate the ship after the vessel apparently lost power. ""At first you kind of thought, maybe this is a Halloween joke and this is supposed to be funny,"" said Wally Yoost, 37, who was in line to get a bingo card with his wife when they felt the ship start to tilt. ""As we were walking out of the room, the whole boat just went black."" Passengers started to panic, he said. ""There was folks crying. ... You could see people were kind of jockeying for the life jackets,"" said Armando Fana, 44. Cindy Parette, 47, said she'd been planning to attend a costume contest and go to a zombie ball aboard the Halloween-themed cruise. Instead, she waited for hours to evacuate the ship with her boyfriend. ""It was hot. People became overwhelmed, and there was no food, nothing,"" she said. Celebration Cruise Line said in a statement that passengers were told to put on life vests and the ship returned to port after the boat hit something while leaving Grand Bahamas Island around 9 p.m. Friday, . ""No passengers were ever in any danger, and everything was handled in an organized and efficient way by ship, corporate and Bahamian personnel,"" the cruise line said. Several passengers told CNN the situation aboard the boat was anything but organized. ""One crew member would say one thing, and then another crew member would say something else. ... They had no idea what to do,"" Parette said. Hours after the alarm first sounded, passengers made it off the boat, Fana said. His anxious 10-year-old son, dressed in an Iron Man costume, began to cry as rumors swirled about what went wrong. ""We were just sitting there for hours,"" he said. Ultimately, passengers were housed in resorts on the island, Celebration said. And Bimini SuperFast helped return the cruise ship's 960 stranded passengers and crew to Port Miami on Saturday evening, Resorts World Bimini spokeswoman Heather Krasnow said in a statement. Two Celebration cruises scheduled for Saturday and Monday were canceled while damage to the boat is assessed. ""Our focus at this time (is) taking care of our passengers who were on the ship or had planned to be on the ship over the next few days,"" Celebration said. Several passengers who'd been onboard the vessel told CNN Sunday that they were hoping for a refund, or a more detailed explanation of what happened or more of a response from the cruise company. ""When you expect two and a half fun-filled days and you get basically a nightmare for 24 hours, you should at least get an apology or something,"" Fana said.

"New York (CNN) -- Fox News and potential presidential candidate Ben Carson went their separate ways last week. Is Fox host and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee next? The tension between Huckabee's current job and possible future job has been laid bare in a number of recent news stories. Huckabee, who sought the Republican nomination for president in 2008, is clearly considering a second run -- which would mean he'd have to give up his Saturday night show on Fox News. On Wednesday, Fox News executive vice president of programming Bill Shine indicated that a decision might be made soon. ""We are taking a serious look at Governor Huckabee's recent activity in the political arena and are evaluating his current status,"" Shine said in a statement to CNN. ""We plan on meeting with him when he returns from his trip overseas."" Due to Huckabee's trip, this Saturday's edition of his show has already been taped. The show, titled ""Huckabee,"" typically draws about 1.3 million viewers on Saturdays, making it a valuable platform for anyone who might want to run for office in the future. Fox News has been a home for any number of prospective candidates in the past, including Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, and Sarah Palin. The cable channel has a policy that requires a person's contract to be terminated if the person forms an exploratory committee. Sometimes it severs ties with political types before they even take that step. Last week Carson -- who has been mulling a presidential bid -- confirmed that his paid contributor arrangement with Fox had been terminated. ""Fox News felt I needed complete independence to fully examine my options,"" Carson said in a statement. ""My departure has been thoroughly amicable and is in the best interest for both Fox News and myself."" Carson was just a paid commentator -- Huckabee has a much higher profile on Fox, given that he has a weekly program. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that Huckabee is ""reconnecting with activists,"" seeking staff members and meeting with potential donors in advance of a potential presidential race. ""Advisers are already scouting real estate in Little Rock, Ark., for a possible presidential campaign headquarters,"" The Post reported. Huckabee acknowledged in an interview with The Post that he has ""obligations in broadcasting"" and thus ""I have to be very careful about this."" A few weeks ago, in an interview with RealClearPolitics, Huckabee described how his show on Fox had helped him on the future-campaign trail in Iowa and elsewhere. Eight years ago, ""they didn't recognize me, and that was true all over the country,"" he said. ""And now I come back, and I've been in these people's homes every week."" (Imagine the envy that some other prospective 2016 presidential candidates probably feel while reading that.) Media Matters, a liberal watchdog group that scrutinizes and criticizes Fox, said Wednesday that ""Huckabee has provided just as much evidence he plans to run for president as Carson"" and called on Fox to drop Huckabee. ""If the network is actually serious about not wanting to keep political candidates on its payroll, it should suspend Huckabee,"" the group said in a statement.","Fox News said Wednesday that the network is reviewing Mike Huckabee's political activity .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius spoke to a friend of Reeva Steenkamp's in a ""very sinister tone"" Tuesday, asking her: ""How can you sleep at night?"" the friend's lawyer said. Kim Myers found the ""unwelcome approach ... extremely disturbing,"" lawyer Ian Levitt said, adding that the incident had been reported to the National Prosecuting Authority. The athlete's spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. The National Prosecuting Authority confirmed that it had received a report about the alleged incident but said it was legally powerless. ""In law we cannot get involved. The Myers family lawyer that made the report was advised to deal with the matter as they deem fit,"" said authority spokesman Nathi Mncube. Pistorius, 27, is accused of murdering Steenkamp, his girlfriend, a model, reality TV star and law school graduate. She was 29 when she was killed. He admits that he fired four bullets through a closed door in his house, killing her, but says he thought he was protecting himself from a burglar. The alleged comments to Steenkamp's friend came on the day that three neighbors testified about what they heard and saw the night the South African amputee track star killed Steenkamp. One, Michael Nhlengethwa, said that when he saw a stretcher leaving the house, ""I knew she was no more."" Nhlengethwa, who lived next door to Pistorius, was awakened by his wife, Eontle, when she heard a ""bang"" that night, he said. Eontle Nhlengethwa imitated the scream she later heard from the Pistorius home, electrifying the court with a powerful wail and then adding, ""But like a man."" Ricca Motshuane, the other neighbor to take the stand Tuesday, also mimicked the sound she heard, letting out two cries, one after another. Defense and prosecution lawyers moved quickly through the three witnesses, leading defense lawyer Barry Roux to suggest that he would conclude his case next Tuesday -- and joking that prosecutor Gerrie Nel should ask more questions so he wouldn't have to have so many witnesses ready. Differing accounts . Five Pistorius neighbors testified for the prosecution, and five have now testified for the defense. The defense witnesses have all described being on friendly terms with the athlete, as opposed to the state witnesses, who said they did not know him. The three who took the stand Tuesday lived closer to Pistorius than the prosecution witnesses and did not hear the same things the state witnesses heard. Several prosecution witnesses described hearing a series of gunshots and a woman screaming. The neighbors who lived closer did not, other than Eontle Nhlengethwa, who heard the single bang that woke her. There is no dispute that Pistorius shot and killed Steenkamp in his home early on the morning of Valentine's Day 2013. But if the judge believes that there was no woman screaming, it could sink the prosecution case that the couple argued before the killing, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said. Two other neighbors, Johan Stander and his daughter Carice, took the stand Monday. They testified that Pistorius was desperate to save Steenkamp's life after he shot her. The South African sprinter was ""praying, crying, torn apart"" after shooting his girlfriend, pleading with her not to die, Stander said. Stander, the first person on the scene after the shooting, made an impassioned defense of Pistorius on the stand as he described what he saw that night. ""His commitment to save the young lady's life -- when he put his finger in the young lady's mouth ... how he begged her to stay alive. ... I saw the truth that morning. I saw it. And I feel it,"" said Stander, who was the first person Pistorius called after killing Steenkamp. 'I've shot Reeva' He went to Pistorius' house in response to an urgent phone call from the double amputee sprinter at 3:18 a.m. on February 14, 2013, he said. ""Please, please, please, come to my house. I've shot Reeva. I thought she was an intruder. Please, please, please, come quick,"" Pistorius begged Stander, the defense witness testified. Stander was the manager of the Silver Woods Estate, where Pistorius lived. Pistorius' defense team appears to be trying to use Stander and his daughter to buttress the athlete's account of the circumstances of the killing, after the prosecution savaged Pistorius on the witness stand. Prosecutor Nel tore into Pistorius over five days in court in April, saying the Paralympic medalist had argued with Steenkamp and killed her on purpose. He tried to force Pistorius to look at a picture of Steenkamp's head after the shooting, accused Pistorius of being selfish and possessive, and said he refused to take responsibility for his actions. Judge Thokozile Masipa must decide whether Pistorius genuinely made a terrible mistake or whether he murdered Steenkamp intentionally. Live blog: Pistorius on trial . The gripping trial has seen Pistorius break down repeatedly, crying, wailing and sometimes throwing up as the court sees and hears evidence about Steenkamp's death. Evidence has included graphic photos of the wounds; testimony from neighbors, friends, police and pathologists; and the actual door through which Pistorius fired four hollow-tipped bullets on the fateful night. Tough cross-examination . Roux has said he will call 14 to 17 witnesses. The Nhlengethwas were the sixth and seventh, and Motshuane was the eighth. Pistorius himself testified for seven days in April. The defense team is seeking to cast doubt on the state's case and needs only to show there is a reasonable doubt that Pistorius meant to kill Steenkamp. Its case will be followed by closing arguments. Masipa will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials. If Pistorius is found guilty of premeditated murder, he faces life in prison. He could be convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide, which would leave his sentence at the discretion of the judge. The trial has gripped South Africa and sports fans worldwide who considered Pistorius a symbol of triumph over physical adversity. His disabled lower legs were amputated when he was a baby, but he went on to achieve global fame as the ""Blade Runner,"" winning numerous Paralympic gold medals on the carbon-fiber blades that gave him his nickname. He also competed against able-bodied runners at the Olympics. Only those in the courtroom saw Pistorius on the stand, because he chose not to testify on camera. His testimony could be heard in an audio feed. Oscar Pistorius trial enters new phase after blistering cross-examination .

"Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday that Israel's announcement of new settlement construction in disputed territory in East Jerusalem was ""insulting"" to the United States. The Israeli announcement came during Vice President Joe Biden's visit this week to Israel. It complicated U.S. efforts to set up so-called proximity talks between the Israelis and Palestinians, the latest attempt to nudge the two sides back toward talking directly. Clinton said the United States' relationship with Israel is not at risk: ""Our relationship is durable. It's strong. It's rooted in common values."" ""But we have to make clear to our Israeli friends and partners that the two-state solution -- which we support, which the prime minister himself says he supports -- requires confidence-building measures on both sides,"" Clinton told CNN's Jill Dougherty. ""And the announcement of the settlements the very day that the vice president was there was insulting."" The construction, announced Tuesday, will be in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood, in disputed territory in East Jerusalem. The Israeli Interior Ministry denies that the territory is in East Jerusalem. Biden arrived in Israel on Monday, meeting first with Israeli President Shimon Peres at his official residence in Jerusalem and then with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden emphasized the close relationship between the United States and Israel as he met with Israeli leaders Tuesday, a visit that also touched on relations with the Palestinians and Iran. However, later Tuesday, after getting word of the settlement announcement, Biden said the United States condemned Israel's decision to build 1,600 housing units in the Jerusalem neighborhood, calling it ""a step that undermines the trust we need right now."" The Israeli Interior Ministry said the construction plan was approved by a district committee, and the public can express objections to it over the next 60 days. ""I mean, it was just really a very unfortunate and difficult moment for everyone -- the United States, our vice president who had gone to reassert our strong support for Israeli security -- and I regret deeply that that occurred and made that known,"" Clinton said Friday. She added that she has no reason to believe that Netanyahu knew about the announcement during Biden's visit but added, ""He is the prime minister. Like the president or secretary of state ... ultimately, you are responsible."" The controversy over Israel's announcement came just a day after the Obama administration's special envoy for Middle East peace announced that Israeli and Palestinian leaders had accepted indirect talks. George Mitchell said Monday that the two sides, with him acting as intermediary, had begun to discuss the ""structure and scope"" of the talks. ""I will return to the region next week to continue our discussions,"" Mitchell said. ""As we've said many times, we hope that these will lead to direct negotiations as soon as possible."" Negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis have been stalled for more than a year, despite the Obama administration's attempt to move toward a resolution of the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Under current agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Israel maintains full control over the West Bank and its borders while the Palestinian government oversees administration of major population centers. Speaking at a Christians United for Israel convention in Jerusalem on Monday, Netanyahu said he welcomes ""the initiation of the peace process between us and the Palestinians."" ""We have been calling to resume the talks without prior conditions for almost a year now,"" he said. ""I hope that the proximity talks will soon lead to direct talks.""","Israelis announced construction in disputed territory in East Jerusalem .

"(CNN)  -- Imagine stepping onto a cold, windy platform at 2 in the morning and waiting just a few seconds for the transit car to show up. Imagine getting in the car and zipping right by stations as you go directly to your destination. Imagine always having a seat on the train. Believe it or not, you're imagining a concept that's more than 50 years old, but still very rare in the real world. It's called personal rapid transit. The cars -- designed to seat four to six people -- would move along a guideway, with their positions aided by embedded magnets or lasers. Other PRT systems have wheels running along sidewalls that help steer each pod car. See images of PRTs . They would merge into traffic and often closely follow the car in front of them. But there would be no traffic lights -- and no drivers. ""It's like an automated taxi that runs on its own roadway and doesn't have to stop,"" said Peter Muller, president of PRT Consulting, a Colorado-based company that works with cities and agencies to study personal rapid transit feasibility. ""It does tend to make sense in more congested areas (like big metropolitan areas), but we have also developed concepts for car-free cities."" There is no PRT system operating in the United States. There is a new one at Heathrow Airport in London and one in the Masdar City district of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Watch PRT in action in Masdar City . There is a people mover at West Virginia University, but the cars on the 8.2 mile-line have room for 20 and during peak periods stop at all five stations. Advocates like Jacob Roberts of Connect Ithaca in New York say that one of the big plusses for PRT would be job creation. While his group entered into the investigation of this form of transit from an environmental standpoint and looking to ease urban sprawl, they soon realized there are just a handful of companies in the business that build the cars and tracks. Three of the major players -- 2getthere, ULTra and Vectus -- are foreign-owned and hope to build plants in the United States. ""You're really talking about a brand new industry,"" he said. Roberts said the region he lives in, upstate New York, really needs an economic boost that manufacturing could help. There are many factories in his area that sit unused, he said. ""There's been a lot of discussion over the past few years (with regional stakeholders) about turning the corner into the new green economy, and using green technology and retooling,"" he said. Several cities in the United States are looking into PRT as a possible way to complement their current transportation system. Connect Ithaca's study, given to the state of New York in September, proposed a 9-mile track connecting the city core and two universities with 350 cars and 26 stations. The estimated cost was between $150 million and $168 million, not including design fees. ""When you throw a number like that out there the average person says, 'We can't afford that,' "" Roberts said. ""But look at a city like San Francisco that is spending hundreds of millions a mile on (its train system). So this is fraction of the cost of light- or heavy-rail and it provides a solution that those kinds of systems don't deliver."" Unlike most transit systems, operating costs can be recouped at the fare box, Muller added. Vukan R. Vuchic, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, disputed that, saying not enough people use transit because it is still cheaper for most to drive a car. And autos have a role in getting people around. ""Modern transportation is designed as intermodal,"" said Vuchic, who has written a trilogy of books on public transportation. ""It combines use of private car and bus and light-rail and rapid transit and does not forget pedestrians."" There is no single answer to the issues of our daily travels, he said. ""People like to think there will be some vehicle that will come and that will solve everything,"" he said. ""It's a naive concept."" Vuchic said there won't be enough people to use PRT in the suburbs to make it profitable and in the packed downtown areas, there will be a need for bigger vehicles that could seat ""30, 40 or even 80 people"" whereas PRT would be difficult to use. Those systems already exist and are in use, he said. San Jose, California, is another U.S. city seriously studying PRT as part of its transportation future. Originally the city was considering an automated people mover to run on a track between the airport and a proposed train station. But that was $600 million. Then a company approached city officials saying they wanted to use San Jose as a test market for group rapid transit. But that company backed out of its offer to build it for free, so San Jose went looking at other modes of transit and discovered PRT. ""We came to the conclusion that this could be very promising, but it is very new technology,"" said Laura Stuchinsky, sustainability officer for the San Jose Department of Transportation. ""We need an evaluation that is really robust, that evaluates the readiness of the technology and the ability of the companies to deliver and really do what we need to have done."" Studies done in other cities have assumed the technology works, and the primary discussion points have been cost and where to locate, she said. San Jose is taking a close look at whether it is worth the risk for a short first track that can be expanded later. ""We think in the end we'll end up with some good information and help the industry move forward in the United States,"" she said. She pointed out that when a city orders a bus or puts in light-rail, it can look at data from other systems to know what it is getting. With PRT, there's nothing but dreams and a few test tracks. Still, like advocates Roberts and Muller, Stuchinsky can foresee a role for the pod car. ""I think what PRT can be is the glue that makes existing transit systems work more effectively,"" she said.  She cited an example where a bus line was cut because it didn't make sense with only a handful of passengers on each bus. ""Here's where PRT could fit in,"" she said. Vuchic, on the other hand, said the problem with the nation's transportation woes is not need for new technology, rather the need for better planning and policy. Policymakers need to consider PRT, said Roberts. It's a question of which U.S. city is going to be first. ""Who is going to have the political will to say I want this done on my watch,"" he said. ""There aren't a lot of communities racing to be the one to take the biggest risk. So there are a lot of cities that are willing to be No. 2. ""No. 1? It's a tough sell.""","Personal rapid transit cars seat four to six people and go directly to their destinations .
Advocates say they could ease congestion, tame urban sprawl, get people out of their cars .
Critic says PRT is a naive concept, other modes of transportation are better .

"(CNN) -- Seven weeks ago, Michael Chiapperini was in Long Island, helping those suffering after Superstorm Sandy. Two weeks ago, he was named ""Firefighter of the Year"" for his department in his upstate New York town of Webster. Monday, he was dead. A gunman -- later identified as William Spengler, 62 -- apparently set his home ablaze, took up a position on a nearby berm, then shot and killed Chiapperini and fellow firefighter Tomasz Kaczowka. Two other firefighters were wounded, as was an off-duty police officer who was driving through the area. Gunman ambushes, kills 2 firefighters . Why Spengler, an ex-felon who killed his grandmother in 1980, committed these crimes is unknown. But authorities say there's no doubt about the quality of the people he killed on Christmas Eve. ""We work with these people everyday, they're like our brothers,"" Webster Police Chief Gerald Pickering said of the firefighters shot. ""It's terrible."" ""These guys are all heroes."" Until Monday, Chiapperini was the person reporters would talk to about killings and other crimes. For the past two decades, he had been a member of the Webster Police Department, rising to the rank of lieutenant and serving as a spokesman. He was promoted in August 2010, telling the hometown Webster Post, ""I want to learn more about the administrative operations of the police department."" The paper noted Chiapperini was a decorated police officer who had risen up through the ranks and was married with three children. Chiapperini served his community outside of the police force. As a volunteer, he also played an active part in the West Webster Fire Department -- one of three such departments in Webster, a town of about 43,000 people located about 10 miles east of Rochester. ""He's held every line office that the department has had"" including chief, fire department spokesman Al Sienkiewicz said. That includes a hands-on role in the department's Explorer program that encourages high school students to learn about firefighting and perhaps become volunteers themselves. Chiapperini was also active on the front lines of fires, with his efforts in specific incidents earning him the department's ""Firefighter of the Year"" award earlier this month, Sienkiewicz said. Service was a way of life for Chiapperini. For example, around Halloween, he and other firefighters from northern New York headed to Long Island to assist in recovery efforts in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. ""He'd been down in Suffolk County to see the destruction, (then) he loses his life this morning, responding to help someone,"" Lt. Gov. Bob Duffy told reporters Monday in Webster. ""When you start looking at the two who lost their lives and the two that are fighting for their lives, (all are) just tremendous public servants.""","Michael Chiapperini was a police lieutenant and volunteer firefighter .

"(CNN) -- Ferry service between San Francisco and points north will be suspended Tuesday morning in anticipation of an expected protest, a regional transportation agency said. The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District announced Monday that there will be no ferry service across San Francisco Bay between the northern California city and Larkspur and Sausalito until about 2 p.m. Tuesday. The agency said it has been engaged in ongoing contract talks with unions representing 375 of its employees, with the next negotiating meeting set for May 7. It said there were reports there will be anything from informational picketing on the Golden Gate Bridge to efforts to shut down traffic on the bridge as well as all ferry services, though those possibilities have not been confirmed by the unions themselves. ""So that our customers are not inconvenienced tomorrow morning May 1 when they arrive at the ferry terminals with a strike action, and no service as a result, we are suspending service and informing our customers,"" the transportation district said, explaining its move. The announcement was made at 3 p.m. (6 p.m. ET), two hours after the same agency issued a release stating it was ""planning to operate all of our services (bridge, bus and ferry) on May 1."" There was no immediate response Monday from union officials as to what exactly is planned. An item on the Local 21, Professional and Technical Engineers' website urges union members to ""take off all or part of the workday to participate in May 1 actions"" including a Golden Gate Bridge ""rally"" from 7 to 10 a.m. It is unclear what effect any actions might have on traffic on Tuesday on the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, which stretches between the city of San Francisco and Marin County. The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District is in charge of the bridge, which 38 million vehicles crossed last year, as well as transit buses and ferry services that it estimates serve more than 9 million customers annually, according to its website. A group of 21 Bay Area unions -- among them bridge and ferry workers, municipal employees, janitors, nurses, longshoremen and grocery store employees -- is planning several events on Tuesday to illustrate their ""fight together to rebalance the distribution of wealth."" These include ""supporting striking ferryboat workers at Bay Area ferry terminals"" between 7 and 10:30 a.m. There will also be a janitors ""walk-out"" at the Westfield Shopping Mall, a march and street festival and an afternoon ""bus tour of the San Francisco 1%,"" according to a press release Monday from the San Francisco Labor Council, one of the organizations that is part of the effort.","NEW: Other unions' members plan to support ferry workers, among other May Day activities .

"(CNN) -- For much of the next 10 days, the center of the baseball universe will not be Boston or L.A. but Kansas City, where the scrappy, longshot Royals will be playing in the World Series for the first time in 29 years. That's right, doubters: Kansas City. KCMO! Part Cowtown, part ""Paris of the Plains,"" to cite just two of its nicknames. To snooty coastal Americans, it's a flyover city, an indistinct heartland burg famous for ... well, nothing. But take a closer look and its humble Midwestern charms come into focus. Like a yoga master, KC sits perfectly centered in America's midsection, surrounded on all sides by subtle prairie beauty. It straddles the Missouri River, and not one, but two states. Even its people are decent -- if New York is Donald Trump, Kansas City is Walter Cronkite, the trusted newsman who lived in the Missouri city as a boy and later started his journalism career there. Here are just some of the reasons Kansas City is already a winner. 1. From last to first . Everyone loves an underdog, and KC is a big one. For the past three decades, while baseball's elite (Yankees, Cardinals, Red Sox) were racking up championships, the Royals toiled in the murky depths of the American League cellar. Over one horrific span of 18 years, they had one winning season. Each miserable spring, Royals' fans' hopes were dashed before the last snowfall melted. 5 reasons to love the Kansas City Royals . But now, despite a roster of no-name players -- most Americans wouldn't know Lorenzo Cain from Lorenzo Lamas -- the Royals are good. Really good. They staged a wild comeback to top the A's, swept the star-studded Angels and have now won a record eight playoff games in a row. Derek Jeter who? Another view: 7 reasons why San Francisco's a winner . 2. Three coins in the fountain(s) Sure, we hear Rome is lovely. But folks in Kansas City will happily tell you they have more fountains, for one thing. Inspired by the grand cities of Europe, planners in the late 1800s filled Kansas City with parks, boulevards and public squares teeming with decorative water displays -- more than 200 in all. One of the first fountains even had basins for horses and dogs to drink from -- how cute is that? Visitors to KC will find cascading fountains, waterspout fountains and fountains punctuated with statues. Even Kauffman Stadium, where the Royals play, has a fountain display beyond its right-field wall. Exuberant fans have been known to jump in them, which will get you thrown out of the ballpark. This year, it's hard to blame them. 3. Royals, meet 'Royals' Yes, Lorde's smash hit ""Royals"" refers mostly to historical monarchs. But there's a surprising Kansas City tie, too. The young singer has said the tune's lyrics were also inspired by a 1976 National Geographic photo she saw of young Royals star George Brett signing baseballs. ""Baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule,"" she sings in the song. ""Let me live that fantasy."" Yes, please, agree hopeful KC fans. 4. For the love of meat . This city knows its meat and more. With joints like Jack Stack and Oklahoma Joe's (an Anthony Bourdain favorite), KC's barbecue can go head-to-head with any of its Southern brethren and come out on top. (Arthur Bryant's is the classic must-mention: You decide if it's better than Bourdain's pick.) After all, it's home to the Kansas City Barbeque Society, the governing body of the competitive barbecue circuit. (Note to barbecue novices: Different spots spell the word differently.) 5. Polite people . People in Kansas City are nice. Heck, Walt Disney grew up there. And witness that likeable actor and KC native Paul Rudd, inviting fans back to his mom's for a celebratory kegger after Wednesday night's pennant win. He almost seemed to mean it. Even the KC cops seem like polite, reasonable fellows. After the ALCS-clinching win they tweeted, ""We trust you'll channel your 29 years of pent-up excitement into a safe and classy celebration, #KC! See you at the World Series!"" 6. All that jazz . New Orleans gets more music hype, but Kansas City was a hotbed of hard-swinging jazz in the early half of the 20th century. Legends like Count Basie, Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Parker and Lester Young all jammed frequently in clubs such as the Hi Hat and the Hey Hey, where players traded competitive solos deep into the night. Robert Altman celebrated this scene in ""Kansas City,"" his 1996 crime drama set against a backdrop of 1930s jazz, and the American Jazz Museum is located in -- you guessed it -- KC. 7. World's tallest water slide . Want an acrophobic thrill? Climb 264 steps and then plunge down the world's tallest water slide at Schlitterbahn Waterpark in Kansas City, Kansas. The Guinness World Records-certified water slide, called VerrÃ¼ckt, is 168 feet 7 inches tall -- a longer drop than Niagara Falls. Even the steps, with their 25 turns, made Travel + Leisure's list of the world's scariest staircases.","The Royals are just one of many cool things about Kansas City .
City's diverse nicknames include Cowtown and ""Paris of the Plains""
KC is famous for its barbecue, legacy of jazz and its many fountains ."
"Beijing (CNN) -- Yang Donglan has had an unusual career trajectory. The 22-year-old once made a living selling cosmetics, but a year ago she switched her make-up brushes for nunchucks, undergoing a grueling training program to become a bodyguard. ""I can go out with the bosses and see a lot of things. It's eye-opening,"" she told CNN. Yang completed a course at Tianjiao International Security Academy, a Beijing-based training camp founded in 2008 to train bodyguards capable of serving the growing numbers of China's elite. She had to crawl through mud in the freezing winter cold, learn to handle a firearm and stay awake for 24 hours in what she refers to as ""devil training."" ""I didn't do a lot of exercise before and when I first started, I had trouble breathing while running but I eventually caught up,"" she said. Booming market . Chen Yongqing, the academy's founder and former bodyguard, said he spotted an opening and decided to jump on what has become a booming market. In 2013, China had 317 billionaires (in U.S. dollars), second only to the United States, according to a ranking compiled by the Hurun Report, a Chinese version of Forbes' rich list. ""We not only give our bodyguards physical training, they are also provided training on things like wine tasting so that they can communicate effectively with their bosses,"" he said. ""They not only serve as bodyguards, but sometimes as a boss' personal assistant."" Chen says that the number of female students is on the rise, adding that woman bodyguards have an advantage over their male counterparts, particularly as the number of female millionaires and billionaires increases. ""Female bodyguards are more appealing to female employers or family members of male employers,"" he said. Yang says that employers prefer female bodyguards because they don't stand out. ""It's easier for us to hide. People don't realize we are bodyguards,"" she says. ""Some guys are really tall; you can easily tell that he is a bodyguard. Also, girls tend to be better at taking care of people."" She is reluctant to divulge any details about her own boss, saying ""loyalty is everything"" in her job. The training, which last for three weeks and costs up to 12,800 yuan ($2,100), is not for the faint-hearted and attracts women from different backgrounds. Brutal training . Recent graduates Xu Si and Zhang Min both aspired to join the military when they were younger, but worked in sales and teaching before they became bodyguards. Xu describes the training as brutal. In the first few days, she had to crawl through mud and jump into freezing water. ""I was trembling, and an 18-year boy quit in the middle,"" said Xu, adding that the other female recruits were her biggest encouragement. Others enroll simply for the experience. Dong, a white-collar professional who only gave her family name, told CNN that she hasn't decided whether she wants to be a bodyguard, but she believes the experience was valuable, allowing her to learn to be tough and persistent. Chen said that many factors had led to the increase of female bodyguards -- a low employment rate, good payment rates, and the chance to meet VIPs and have other eye-opening experiences -- but the most important, Chen said, was the growing confidence of women in China today. ""Women today are more confident in taking careers that are usually perceived as male-dominated,"" Chen said. Contrary to popular belief, Chen says that fewer women quit the course than men. ""Most of our girls stick it out to the end,"" he said. Yang has been working as a bodyguard for almost a year and says she has no plans to change to a different career despite the risks involved. ""It's my duty to protect and act fast,"" Yang said. ""I think I would stick to the job no matter what. It's a journey.""","Number of female recruits training to be bodyguards on the rise .

"(CNN) -- Severe flooding killed at least five people in central Tennessee on Saturday, officials said, as floodwaters inundated roads, highways and homes in and around the Nashville area. The National Weather Service also said 33 of 75 counties in Arkansas are under a tornado warning, and 25 counties in Tennessee are under a tornado watch. Two people were killed Saturday when floodwaters swept them away as they tried to seek safety on the roof of their SUV about 80 miles northwest of Nashville, Stewart County emergency management spokesman Clint Mathis said. Three more people were reported dead in counties near Nashville, Tennessee Emergency Management spokesman Jeremy Heidt told CNN. Between 6 and 10 inches of rain has fallen in 12 hours in the area, causing ""extremely dangerous"" flooding, the National Weather Service said. ""This is one of the most severe rain events Nashville has ever experienced,"" Nashville Mayor Karl Dean said in a statement. Dean said more than 50 water rescues had been conducted Saturday, and more were under way. ""I urge all Nashville residents to stay home and stay off the roads,"" Dean said. At least 2,000 people were displaced after two levees broke in Millington, a small city near Memphis, Millington Police said. Video from CNN affiliate WZTV showed more than a dozen vehicles submerged in several feet of swift-moving water on I-24 in Nashville. Rescue workers helped drivers escape as water surrounded their cars, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. The floodwaters pushed a home off of its foundation and into the middle of I-24. Video from WZTV showed a school annex building floating down the interstate before breaking into pieces. WSMV: Section of I-24 closed by massive flooding . Officials are advising residents to stay off roads, as many have become impassable. Janel Lacy, a spokeswoman for the Nashville mayor's office, said that in addition to I-24 in Davidson County, 20 other local roads were closed. CNN iReporter Andrew Ellis sent in a video of a ""raging river"" of water rushing over an open field where people usually play soccer and golf in Lexington, Tennessee. ""The flooding brought the town to a standstill. No one could get in and no one could get out,"" he said. ""Many homes, vehicles and entire neighborhoods either were or still are under water."" CNN iReporter Jennifer Alter said her dad helped her push her car out after she got stuck on Christmasville Road in Jackson, Tennessee, on the way to work early Saturday morning. ""We went back to check it a few hours later and the road was gone,"" she said. Lacy said one shelter had opened at Lipscomb University, and officials planned to open others. The rain is expected to continue into Sunday morning, she said. Heidt said floodwaters were expected to crest around 11 p.m. CT (midnight ET) Saturday.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC, are demonstrating real leadership on a tough issue. The issue: immigration. Their solution: a comprehensive reform bill combining enforcement with earned legal status for illegal immigrants, which they appear ready to introduce any day now. But before Congress returns to a debate that tied it up in knots a few years ago, and before Americans begin arguing -- on talk radio and blogs, at water coolers and Little League games -- over what to do about border security, workforce needs, the process for immigrating legally, and the status of 10.3 million illegal immigrants, we need to be absolutely clear about why the United States has so much illegal immigration in the first place. Until we can answer that question candidly and without regard for hurt feelings, we'll never be able to curb the future flow of illegal immigrants. Americans remember the debate over the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which offered amnesty to nearly 2.7 million illegal immigrants. Now, many of them want a guarantee that, if they go along with offering illegal immigrants what would this time be a conditional legal status (as opposed to ""amnesty""), they won't have to go through all this again in another 24 years. Well, that's up to us -- and how we address the question: Why does the United States have so much illegal immigration? The answer is not as simple as what you hear from the right -- that we haven't been serious about border enforcement, and have instead created a social services magnet that draw migrants north in search of free benefits. And it's not as simple as what you hear from the left -- that trade deals like NAFTA have destroyed the Mexican economy and thus propelled immigrants north in search of higher wages. It's not just because of porous borders, or a reluctance to punish employers who hire illegal immigrants, or because Mexico is a ""failed state"" that can't provide enough jobs for its own people. Everyone likes to point fingers. And no one wants to accept any degree of responsibility for the problem. That's what many Americans find so appealing about this fantastical rhetoric about how the country is experiencing an ""invasion"" as if we were all sitting in our backyards and minding our own business when, over the horizon, came an army of nannies, gardeners, housekeepers, short-order cooks, chamber maids, construction workers and farm laborers demanding to do our chores. Why does the United States have so much illegal immigration? I know the answer. It's my fault. It's because of me, and tens of millions of other Americans just like me. We create the demand for illegal immigrant labor not because of anything we do but because of all the things that we will not do  -- at any wage. Even as someone who juggles several jobs, I have to admit that my work ethic -- especially for hard, physical labor -- is a distant second to that of my immigrant grandfather who came from Mexico legally in the early 1900's. My grandfather was a farm worker who would make it a point to show up to a job early and start working a half hour before he clocked in, as his way of showing appreciation to his employer for hiring him. There are days when my employer doesn't see me before noon, because I'm writing somewhere else or giving a speech or making my kids breakfast. My grandfather would do any kind of work without complaint and graciously accept whatever wages were offered because he felt as if the employer was doing him a favor by giving him a way to support his family. When I start a new job, I instinctively negotiate for a higher salary and more vacation time than I had at my last one -- that is, more money for less work -- and I usually feel like I'm doing the employer a favor by showing up. Now multiply me by 10 million or 20 million. And amplify it for all those Americans who are younger than me, those 18-to-35-year-olds who have been raised by their parents to shun hard work and think of themselves as special and entitled to high-paying and non-strenuous jobs that are also emotionally satisfying. If Americans want to stop importing foreign workers, either legally or illegally, then we had better start producing domestic workers who will do the kinds of hard and dirty jobs that our grandparents did without complaint -- and that now, these many years later, most of us won't do without complaining. You won't hear that from members of Congress. They're too worried about staying popular with constituents, and insulting parenting skills would not be helpful. But lawmakers have to get over that, and start dealing with the issue of illegal immigration with honesty and courage. Or they'll only make the problem worse. Listen up, Congress. A lot of you like to beat your chests and talk tough on this issue. Well, in this case, the problem is with your constituents.  They're the ones who need the scolding. Have at it.

"Washington (CNN) -- Memories of his own service in Vietnam and the destructive nature of combat are never far from the mind of Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, the first former enlisted man to lead the Pentagon. ""Every Vietnam veteran understands,"" Hagel told CNN's Barbara Starr during an interview outside his office in the Pentagon. ""Any veteran who has ever served in a war understands that, and I think we should never forget the consequences of war."" Decades after the U.S. conflict in Vietnam, Hagel is using the power of his office to help some of the most troubled veterans of that war get the second chance he feels some deserve. He is essentially ordering the Pentagon to open the books and allow some veterans of that war with less than honorable discharges to be classified as suffering from post traumatic stress and allow that to be a considered factor in their discharge. Related: Chuck Hagel reunites with Vietnam platoon commander . The move could potentially allow thousands of veterans who did not qualify for disability pay because of their discharge status to finally be compensated. For Hagel, who served as a senior official in the Veterans Department during the early years of the Reagan administration, the time has come to address an issue overshadowing veterans of his war, that has really only come to the forefront recent years. ""I just really felt, as I always have, that they deserve a little break here lets take another look,"" Hagel said of the policy change. ""I think a lot of people were treated unfairly because there was no recognition of PTSD."" It is a recognition that many feel is long overdue. ""In our generation, there was the term the 'crazy' Vietnam vet,"" Steve Peck, a former Marine who fought in Vietnam, said recently. ""You know, guys shooting up gas stations, and robbing stores, and, you know, going off and killing people. That was the impression of Vietnam veterans when they came back."" Peck has spent his career advocating for veterans of that war and trying to shine a light on a mental condition that was not recognized and may have unfairly penalized some of those who came home. ""It was just seen an as aberration, it was not seen as something that was a natural result of being in combat, and that's why so many Vietnam vets are so alienated,"" Peck said. With most Vietnam vets now in their sixties and seventies, time is a precious commodity. And with high rates of homelessness, depression and suicide among the group, the drumbeat for this recognition has grown louder. CNN visited a facility in Long Beach, California taking care of more than 500 homeless veterans, many of them from Vietnam who are still struggling from that long ago war. ""I used to have nightmares when I came home and pretty much blocked it out of my mind,"" said Joel Hunt, a resident of the facility who was sent to Vietnam when he was 19. He is glad the government is looking to do more for some of his buddies. ""I think it's great because you know we were drafted, we were forced to go,"" he said. Some forty years later, the man who runs the Pentagon, fully understands the challenges his fellow veterans faced after coming home. ""No one was ever told about what you would be dealing with or any kind of reaction to war, or the horrors of war,"" Hagel said. And with the job, came an opportunity to address an oversight affecting many of his fellow veterans . ""I think it's a responsibility I have,"" Hagel said. ""I think that any Vietnam veteran who had the privilege of holding this job that I have would do the same thing, and I just think it's an obligation I have to those I served with.""","Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has directed the Pentagon to reassess Vietnam era discharges .

"New York (CNN) -- Two workers at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport post office were exposed to phosphoric acid Sunday from a package that originated from China, a law enforcement official said.

A hazardous response team from the FBI responded to the airport ""out of an abundance of caution,"" said Peter Donald, a spokesman for the FBI in New York. The product was identified as organophosphate and secured by Port Authority police. The package was contained to the post office, and airport operations were not affected, the official said. Donald said the package ""was determined to be beauty supplies.""

"(CNN) -- To hear some Guatemalans tell it, three coordinated attacks that killed four prison officials in five hours Monday hardly raised anyone's pulse. Police arrests two suspects in one of the three attacks. They're used to this level of violence, said Fernando Carrera Castro, director of the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies in Guatemala City. Although what happened is normal in Guatemala, Carrera said, that's not to say that citizens are not concerned. ""We're as scared as ever,"" he said Tuesday. Heather Berkman, a Central America analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm, also has come to expect the violence. ""What else is new?"" she said when asked about the killings. Samuel Logan, an expert on Latin American gangs, said all of Central America is under attack from organized crime cartels because the region is pinched between Colombia and Mexico, the two biggest sources of drugs in the area. U.S. interdiction efforts that have targeted the flow of drugs through the Caribbean Sea also have forced cartels to travel through the Central American isthmus, Logan said. Within Central America, he said, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have the worst problems. Among those three nations, Guatemala stands out. ""When you talk about a country being hollowed out by organized crime, Guatemala is at the top of the list,"" Logan said. There are two main reasons, he said: geography and an incompetent and corrupt government. ""Guatemala bunches right up against Mexico,"" Logan said. ""Any spillover effect is almost certainly going south."" Said Berkman, ""The narcos are coming down from Mexico."" In addition, Logan said, the federal government is not able to control large segments of the country. For example, Peten state in northern Guatemala, bordered on two sides by Mexico, is lawless, he said. Berkman made the same point. ""The narcos control about 40 percent of the territory down there, which is pretty amazing,"" she said. Berkman also pointed out that the government has reduced anti-crime spending in the 2010 budget because of the nation's dire economic situation. ""If you don't have resources, you can't pay for troops and supplies and intelligence,"" she said. Logan, who just wrote a book on the Mara Salvatrucha gang of Central America, said there are two main criminal elements in Guatemala: drug cartels that deal in large-scale exportation and street gangs that sell drugs at the retail level and are involved in other crimes, such as robbery and extortion. In some cases, they work together. When those criminals get arrested, they continue their activities on the inside. ""The prisons, in general, are centers of corruption,"" Carrera said. ""From inside prison, they direct kidnappings, extortion, drug trafficking."" Monday's attacks on the prison officials resulted from efforts to weed out corruption in the nation's prisons, Carrera said. Officials have been clamping down on what goods inmates can receive and the use of cell phones within prison walls. They also are transferring some top-level criminals to high-security prisons. ""What happened is a reaction from gangs who want control of the prisons,"" Carrera said. ""They're trying to show strength through force. To generate fear."" Interior Minister Raul Velasquez was quoted in several newspapers Tuesday as saying the attacks were in retaliation for the recent transfer of several gang leaders to high-security prisons. Two arrests have been made in Monday's shootings and the investigation continues, said Rudy Esquivel, spokesman for the Guatemalan prison system. ""This was a very structured job; very well-defined,"" Esquivel said from Guatemala City, the nation's capital. Killed were a prison assistant director, a warden and two guards. One guard and a shooting suspect were wounded, as were three citizens. One of the wounded was a woman in the eighth month of pregnancy, news accounts said. According to published reports in the Prensa Libre, La Hora, El Periodico de Guatemala and Siglo 21 newspapers, this is what happened: . The first attack occurred around 7 a.m. Monday in Guatemala City when two gunmen on a motorcycle fired an AK-47 assault rifle at three guards who were transporting a prisoner. One of the guards was killed and another wounded. A national civil police unit driving in front of the prison detail gave chase and captured the suspects, one of whom suffered a serious leg injury. The second attack happened 10 minutes later, when the warden at the prison in the city of Guastatoya, in central Guatemala, was gunned down while he ate in front of the Hospital General San Juan de Dios. The warden, Felix Gabriel Garcia Reyes, was at the hospital to pick up the body of a prisoner who had died after surgery. Two men and a pregnant 19-year-old woman were wounded in the attack. Witnesses told police four men in a green vehicle fired and fled. Authorities found an abandoned Mitsubishi nearby that matched the description. Inside, they found a 9 mm pistol and ammunition for other weapons. The third attack occurred around noon on the Inter-American Highway near the city of Chimaltenango, where Javier Bac Tzul, 40, was the prison's assistant director. He and his 31-year-old driver were killed as they returned to the prison after a trip to Guatemala City. Authorities said they found AK-47 shells at the scene. Chimaltenango Gov. Hector Lopez said a prison director and two assistant directors already have been killed in the state, Prensa Libre reported. Analyst Berkman sees little hope. ""It's a lose-lose situation, no matter how you look at it,"" she said.","Four killed in three orchestrated attacks, local papers say .

"(CNN) -- Diplomacy is never easy. Top diplomats of Iran, the United States and other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany, spent three days debating a first, interim deal on Iran's nuclear program. And an agreement was found: After 34 years of estrangement, Iran and the U.S. were finally on the same page. Still, the deal fell through. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius showed up in Geneva, Switzerland, a day into the talks and adopted a hawkish line that guaranteed the failure of the discussions. And much to the dismay of the other diplomats involved, Fabius broke protocol and announced both details of the talks and the failure to reach a deal before U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had a chance to address the media. Fabius, echoing the objections of hard-line Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, argued that Iran would get too much in the proposed deal. But in reality Iran was only offered modest sanctions relief in return for some significant suspension of aspects of its nuclear program. Here's why the deal the United States negotiated, and France scuttled, would have been good for America. 1. Iran would not get a nuclear weapon . The most important aspect of the agreement with Iran that U.S. President Barack Obama is pursuing is that Tehran would not be able to build a nuclear weapon. If Tehran tries to cheat, it would be caught very early in that process and face consequences. By limiting Iran's nuclear enrichment activities to below 5% enrichment, combined with the most intrusive inspections that exist -- the Additional Protocol to the Non-Proliferation Treaty -- the deal means Iran could not amass the material to build a nuclear bomb. In short, Obama would achieve America's main national security objective. 2. This would be a good deal for Israel . Even though Netanyahu would never say it publicly, he knows very well that this would be a good deal for Israel -- not only because it would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb, but because improved U.S.-Iran relations inevitably would lead to a softening of Iran's position on Israel. This has already happened since Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was elected. When Iran's strategic interest has dictated such a position on Israel, it has pursued that path in spite of its ideological inclinations to challenge Israel. Don't take it from me, take it from the former head of Israel's intelligence services, Efraim Halevy: ""If the dynamism that leads to a resolution of the nuclear issue, leads to a thaw between Iran and the U.S., it's very difficult for the Iranians to envisage an 'American spring' at the same time they pursue a confrontation with Israel."" 3. It would be good for human rights and democracy in Iran . Human rights defenders and pro-democracy activists in Iran have for years testified that tensions between Iran and United States -- with the risk of war and devastating economic sanctions -- have made their work all the more difficult. The situation created an Iran with military-security forces in charge. Everything was seen through the prism of a potential war with the United States. Political freedom and human rights became lesser priorities for Iranians when the primary concerns were to survive the economic malaise and avoid war. Democracy simply does not flourish under the threat of war or under the burden of economic collapse. With the reduction of tensions as a result of this deal, the opportunity would rise once more for the defenders of democracy and human rights to push Iran's political system toward greater freedom. 4. The destructive escalation train would be stopped . For the first time since 2005, key elements of the Iranian nuclear program would be frozen. This would be a significant achievement: Although the West has for years escalated its sanctions and put great pressure on the Iranian economy, Iran has at the same time expanded its nuclear program, inching closer toward a nuclear weapons capability -- a mutual escalation, with no solution in sight. Obama's deal with Iran would put a stop to that. Negotiations could proceed without the nuclear program progressing at the same time. 5. It would advance the fight against al Qaeda . In spite of their enmity, some issues have found Iran and the United States on the same side, perhaps nowhere more than in the struggle against al Qaeda. Iran has been targeted by al Qaeda's terrorism for decades. It is often said that the Salafi Sunni extremists in al Qaeda hate the Shiites in Iran more than the infidels in America. Yet the hostility between Iran and the United States has prevented them from collaborating against this common threat to the extent that they could and should. By opening the path to improved relations between the two states through the nuclear deal, they could claim common cause against this global threat and help stabilize the region. 6. There would be peace, not war . Last but not least, not only would Obama's deal prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, it would also prevent a devastating war with Iran. Make no mistake: Although the U.S. military can handle another war, the U.S. economy cannot absorb its cost. Without this deal, a military confrontation would become all but certain and the American people would have to kiss the economic recovery goodbye. The American people who fought tooth and nail against a limited war with Syria would have to settle for a war with Iran that could well be far more devastating. Thanks to Obama's diplomacy, this nightmare scenario could be prevented. Join us Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- China's propaganda system appears to be working hard to belittle U.S. President Barack Obama before he heads to Asia for three key multilateral meetings. The open mockery of the Democratic Party's loss in the midterm elections is likely an attempt to put the President on the defensive before he lands in Beijing on Monday. But it's really little wonder that China is trying to change the subject from its own problems, both foreign and domestic. For a start, Chinese President Xi Jinping will want no trouble from a U.S. president as he executes his anti-corruption campaign, the primary purpose of which many believe is to consolidate and further centralize his power. Meanwhile, Xi is also dealing with a restive empire, including a democracy movement in Hong Kong and unrest in Xinjiang, which has seen terror attacks against Chinese civilians and paramilitary officers. Domestically, Xi is not helping matters by clamping down on Hong Kong residents' rights or repressing the mostly peaceful population of Xinjiang. But China's policies are also sparking problems regionally, as Xi continues to press China's claims in the South and East China Seas, something Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam are all strongly resisting. Add in the fact that China's long and successful run of rapid investment and export-led growth is coming to an end with slack global demand and growing Chinese debt, and it's clear that Obama is arriving at a politically tense time in Beijing. Obama, of course, faces his own domestic political issues after the thumping his party received in Tuesday's midterms, and the incoming Republican Senate majority will be eager to work with the President to get tougher on China and assert U.S. power and influence in Asia. With all this in mind, what should Obama be pushing for as he meets leaders from the region? Here's a five-point wish list for the President that will help get U.S. policy in the Asia-Pacific region on track: . Bring the Trans-Pacific Partnership to a quick conclusion: The TPP -- a free-trade agreement that would involve 12 countries, including the United States -- is not only good for the American economy, but is also good for U.S. foreign policy. A successful negotiation of the agreement and quick ratification in Congress would demonstrate that only the U.S. can lead on trade liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region. Push back over South China Sea: Obama should have the Department of Defense announce, in conjunction with Southeast Asian friends and allies, that it is implementing new moves to counter Chinese coercive moves in the South China Sea. This initiative should include a major effort by the United States to develop a coalition maritime domain awareness system that would allow all friends and allies to have the same real-time intelligence and information about Chinese aggressive activities. This should be the building block for an allied defense organization in Asia. Reinvigorate Japan ties: The administration should work with Japan on a comprehensive plan to stop Chinese coercion in the East China Sea. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has outlined a forward-leaning defense strategy with plenty of room for integration of air and naval forces. There is much Japan and the United States can do to ramp up shows of force and exercises to demonstrate that China will not gain anything through its continued harassment of Japanese commercial and defense assets in these seas. Be honest about China's shortcomings: Obama should follow China's cue and criticize the Chinese leadership. It is past time to speak forcefully about Xi's failure to reform the Chinese economy and to bring up his human rights crackdown throughout China. It is also time to side with the growing number of Chinese who are fighting for basic human rights. Leverage America's energy advantage: Obama should take advantage of the U.S. energy revolution to shore up alliances and friendships with major gas consumers, such as Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. A public commitment by Obama while in Asia to fast-track licenses for companies seeking to export gas to friends and allies would be a serious demonstration of leadership. The reality is that China is trying to define Obama as a weak leader, and by extension, the United States as a weakening country. But structurally, the U.S. is far stronger than many assume. It has close friends and allies in the region, it is becoming a net energy producer, it has the world's most powerful and tested military, and it has a set of principles and ideals that speak to universal hopes. China has none of these things. During his time in Asia, Obama can begin to reverse the dangerous perception of a U.S. that is weakening while China rises. This week offers as good a time as any to start pushing back.","Dan Blumenthal: Chinese media have openly mocked Democrats' midterm loss .

"(CNN) -- When Debbie Wasserman Schultz visited her friend Gabrielle Giffords in the hospital last week, she talked to her about the demonstrations in Egypt and the Republicans' proposed budget cuts -- not exactly topics you might expect during a hospital visit. But Wasserman Schultz says she remembers what she wanted to talk about when she was hospitalized with breast cancer a few years ago. ""As much as (Giffords' husband, Mark Kelly) cares about her, he doesn't know all the fun stories about what's going on in Washington,"" she said. ""There's only 435 of us in the House of Representatives, and I knew she'd want to be caught up on what's going on, so I told her stories about different colleagues and who said what."" In the nearly six weeks since the Arizona Democrat was shot, Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, has made three trips to visit her friend: two to Tucson and one to Houston, where Giffords is in a rehabilitation hospital. She's planning another trip there in a few weeks. She fits the travel into her busy schedule because she remembers how important such visits were to her when she was recovering from her seven breast cancer surgeries, including a double mastectomy, breast reconstruction and removal of her ovaries. ""Being hospitalized and sidelined in such a significant way can be so isolating, and Gabby is even more isolated from the world than I was. She's isolated in her own body while she's recovering,"" she said. Wasserman Schultz says that even though Giffords couldn't speak to her during a visit two weeks ago, she felt that Giffords understood what she told her and appreciated the visit. ""She reacts with facial expressions as she would ordinarily, just without words,"" she said. ""She smiles; she frowns; she laughs."" When Wasserman Schultz tried to think about what gift her friend would most want, the answer was easy: Giffords would want someone to help take care of the people in her district in Arizona. ""Her constituents are so important to her, and my staff jumped right in to help with constituent services,"" she said. Wasserman Schultz's own constituents say they feel like well-cared-for friends, even when they don't live near the congresswoman. Eleven years ago, doctors told Rixys Alfonso her 2-year-old son, Devin Alvarez, was going to die. Her doctor in Florida said there were no more treatments left to treat his congenital disease, called Sprengle's deformity, and Florida Medicaid was unwilling to pay for her son to go a surgeon in Texas who could help him. Alfonso says that not only did Wasserman Schultz, then a member of the Florida Legislature, persuade Medicaid to pay for Devin to get treatment in Texas, but she's called and visited him regularly even after moving to Washington in 2005 to become a member of Congress. ""If it weren't for Debbie, he'd be dead, and she didn't have to do any of it,"" Alfonso says. ""She's a mom to the community."" Sometimes, when a friend who lives far away has a medical crisis, it's tough to know how often to visit, what to say or what you can do to help without violating your friend's and their family's privacy. But Wasserman Schultz says that stepping forward can make a huge difference. In her case, her friends were ""critical"" because she received all her care in Washington, while her husband, Steve Schultz, stayed home in Florida with their three young children, who were unaware of her breast cancer diagnosis. ""My mother was with me, but she works full-time and had to get back to work, so my girlfriends came up to be with me and rotated every few days so I'd always have one of them with me,"" she said. Here are tips from Wasserman Schultz and others about how to give your friend the best care you can even when you live far away. 1. Know your friend . If you're not sure whether your friend wants to you to travel for a visit, ask. ""Everyone deals with illness differently,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""Some like to have a lot of interaction, and others are private. It really is very unique. ""In Gabby's case, she can't express her opinion, so Mark's got to do it for her,"" she said. ""But in most cases, people can say what they want."" 2. Make specific offers . When television reporter Diem Brown got ovarian cancer five years ago at age 23, many friends said something to the effect of ""let me know what I can do."" To her, that felt like an empty promise. ""I got very, very bitter. Everyone said, 'I want to help you,' but I felt like it wasn't real,"" she remembered. What did help were friends who helped her figure out specifically what she needed. In her case, it was a wig -- a good one that cost $2,000 that she could wear on TV -- and her friends helped her pay for it. Brown, an entertainment reporter for Sky TV, has since started medgift.com, where patients can register for the gifts they want, just as couples make a wedding registry. 3. Give the right gift . If you can't send yourself to your friend, send the right gift. Carepages.com has some ideas, including a subscription to an online video rental service or an appointment for pampering at a spa for after the person has been discharged. ""You should try to put yourself in the person's shoes when getting a gift,"" Brown advised. ""For example, maybe they have a dog, and what they need is a service to walk the dog."" 4. Call at night . ""Know that nighttime is often the hardest time for people in crisis,"" psychologist Gail Brenner writes on her blog. ""Call in the evening to check in."" 5. Call weeks later . Support often flows in when someone first becomes ill and then wanes when the illness goes on and on. Brenner suggests checking in with your friend weeks or months after the initial health crisis, when others may have stopped calling.","Rep.

"(CNN) -- In West Africa, the bodybuilder is a popular subject for photographers. Since the 1950s, the musclemen have peered out from stark images, symbols of ""strength, power, pride and status,"" in the words of gallery owner Jack Bell. In the photographs of Leonce Raphael Agbodjelou, the image goes deeper. Leonce, who's based in Porto-Novo, Benin, did a series of photographs called ""Musclemen"" in which he showcases the local bodybuilders. In one photo, a fit, smiling man holds ... plastic flowers. In another, three men pose together, all with bouquets. That's not all: The men pose in colorful, patterned pants and in front of equally dazzling backdrops. In fact, in picture after picture, the strength of the musclemen is contrasted with the delicacy of the flowers -- a traditional way to show style and taste, according to the artist -- and the boldness of the fabric colors. It creates a vibrant, even impish twist on conventional strongman photographs. That's deliberate, says Bell. ""Benin is all about color -- Porto Novo is like a visual assault,"" he says in an email on behalf of his client. (Leonce does not speak English.) ""The images are straight out of urban market scenes and the hurly burly of bars, street stalls and traffic jams. Leonce is part of a generation experiencing rapid change and his photographs capture this energy and unfettered zest for life."" Leonce comes to photography naturally. His father was a renowned artist, Joseph Moise Agbodjelou, who opened a studio in Porto-Novo, Benin's capital, in 1960. Leonce Agbodjelou has continued the family business and is also the founder and director of Benin's first photographic school. The bodybuilders are only one of his subjects. He has an ongoing project to photograph a variety of Porto-Novo's citizens. ""Agbodjelou interprets the experience of a generation caught between tradition and progress. His studio has become a crossroads for Porto-Novo's diverse population,"" says Bell, who found out about the artist while traveling in Benin and Mali in 2010. ""The photographer's studio is, like the hairdressing salons of Porto-Novo, a meeting place for a diverse demographic and a site of exchange,"" he says. Father and son have their differences, Bell observes. ""Joseph Moise shot in black and white using a 6 x 6 Rollieflex. Leonce's use of vibrant color in his portraiture was a new development. It lent itself well to the young artist's enquiries into voodoo and the mystical in West Africa and Benin's colonial history,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- After the past week's political upheavals in Washington and around the country, we are reminded that certain things remain constant in politics. Unfortunately, one of those things is the sexism leveled at any woman who rises to power in the White House -- under presidents of either party. No sooner was the hunt on for a fall guy for the Democratic midterm losses than some in the press predictably went after a fall gal -- President Barack Obama's senior adviser, Valerie Jarrett. Reporter Carol Felsenthal in Politico and others have decided that the best way to address Democratic losses is to have a ""shake-up"" at the White House, and the person they most want to see shaken out is Jarrett. She is pilloried for everything from run-ins with other staffers to playing herself in a cameo role on CBS' ""The Good Wife."" That's how much they object to the job Valerie Jarrett is doing -- they don't even want her doing it in the fictional realm. The Politico story, headlined ""Fire Valerie Jarrett, even notes that ""nobody knows precisely what Jarrett does in the White House."" But whatever it is, it's wrong enough that she needs to be fired. Withering criticism is something that is meted out regardless of gender in Washington. Attorney General Eric Holder has been called every name in the book, including the ones that have to be spelled using asterisks. But Jarrett is being subjected to a refrain of snipes and swipes that sound like they were cribbed from the Twitter feed of one of ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey."" The litany of Jarrett's run-ins with other White House power brokers reads like a plot synopsis for a new ""Mean Girls"" movie. Even more telling are the descriptions of Jarrett that trivialize her position and the skills that got her to that position. The Politico article states, ""If her role in this administration reflected reality, Jarrett would be called 'First Big Sister' to both Michelle and Barack."" ""Big Sister!"" Karl Rove may have been characterized as an evil genius, but he was never reduced to being called merely George Bush's big brother figure. He was given credit for being good at what he did, not dismissed as a sycophantic surrogate sibling. But Felsenthal fails even to acknowledge any of Jarrett's good works. Senior administration officials have told me she played an important role in making sure that the uninsured, particularly uninsured women, were enrolled in the Affordable Care Act. More than 4.3 million women and girls enrolled in coverage during the first open enrollment period. As of June, 29.7 million women are estimated to have access to expanded preventive services coverage such as mammograms, HIV testing, contraception and other screenings with no cost-sharing. She spent months developing and executing a plan to bring community leaders and celebrities into the ACA rollout to reach uninsured people ""where they are."" In another article, U.S. News & World Report is somewhat more generous to Jarrett. Mark Davis, a former White House speechwriter in the George H.W. Bush administration, says, ""Jarrett is the White House 'mirror, mirror on the wall' who has cultivated the psychological dependency of the president of the United States."" According to him, Jarrett still attained her power through mere flattery, but at least she has a certain Disney villain sinister cachet. And as someone who psychologically controls the President, she's more Big Brother than big sister. Valerie Jarrett is certainly not the first woman who achieved power in Washington to be treated so disrespectfully. The shards of the broken glass ceiling cut both Democrat and Republican. When George W. Bush was President, The New York Times' Maureen Dowd dismissed Bush female staffers Condoleezza Rice, Karen Hughes and Harriet Miers all as nothing more than ""adoring work wives, catering to W.'s every political, legal and ego-affirming need."" Evidently presidents of either party choose their male advisers based on their talents, and their female advisers based purely on their ability to serve up chicken soup for the soul. Dowd said, ""W. loves being surrounded by tough women who steadfastly devote their entire lives to doting on him."" One can't even read that statement without picturing Miers tousling Bush's hair. Dowd was especially fond of the phrase ""office wives,"" which is the sort of thing that really should only be said by characters in the show ""Mad Men,"" and even then only the early seasons. At another point, Dowd implies that Rice got her job as secretary of state by just spending time with W. and ""making him feel like the most thoughtful, farsighted he-man in the world."" In one sentence, a woman who had devoted her life to diplomacy and public service has been reduced to a cheerleader ... and a self-serving cheerleader at that. Hillary Clinton has been attacked for being Hillary Clinton for so long now that it's easy to forget that the criticism of her began with the same sexist overtones now being used on Jarrett. Before Hillary-bashing became its own thing, she was subjected to the standard-issue woman-bashing used on every powerful woman in Washington. Well, Clinton got the royal treatment -- she was routinely compared to Lady Macbeth. A New York Times piece from 1992 said that at least 20 articles in major publications that year had compared her to Shakespeare's homicidal heroine with the stain problems. ""Out, damned spot!"" Great -- even Shakespeare's greatest villainess sounds like a laundry-obsessed housewife to modern ears. The only surprising thing about all of the comparisons of Clinton to Lady Macbeth is that so many Washington pundits are familiar with the classics. The Politico article calling for Jarrett's ouster ends up suggesting that maybe she can be transitioned out by making her the ""Obama librarian"" in charge of plans for the presidential library. Really, librarian? Why not just give her another stereotypical female job? She could become his secretary -- fielding phone calls and taking messages. Or bookkeeper, balancing the checkbook. White House nurse, or a stewardess on Air Force One! Women in Washington -- and in positions of power anywhere -- should be subjected to the same criticisms and held to the same standards as men. That does not include the assumption that any successful woman has attained her position through flattery, feminine wiles or her ability to provide maternal comfort to a more powerful man. We can criticize a person's performance without demeaning her based on gender. After all, our most basic human flaws transcend gender -- so should our criticism of those flaws.","In wake of Democratic election losses, some call for firing of Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett .

"(CNN) -- ""Get yourself together."" Mary Williams repeated those three words often to her 28-year-old daughter, who served three years in a Kansas prison for a 1988 armed robbery. Donnie Belcher, 7, visits her mother, Wanda Taylor, at Lansing Correctional Facility in Kansas in 1991. Williams never judged her daughter, Wanda Taylor, for the crime or the crack cocaine addiction that fueled it. There was no need to pick at the past. Instead, Williams looked to the future. The future was her granddaughter, Donnie Belcher, a shy 4-year-old girl with curly hair who cried inconsolably from behind the glass the first time she visited her mother in jail. The little girl's mother was locked up for three years, leaving her in the care of her grandmother. ""It was hard on me,"" said Belcher, now 25. ""I never wanted to leave my mother."" Belcher defied the odds, growing up straight as an arrow despite having a mother in prison. Her childhood was part of a national trend. The incarceration rates for U.S. mothers began to surge in the 1980s, fueled by the crack cocaine epidemic and tougher mandatory sentencing laws, experts said. A recent study by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found the number of incarcerated mothers rose 131 percent from 1991 to 2007, while the number of fathers in prison increased 77 percent during the same period. According to the Sentencing Project, a Washington-based nonprofit, about 1.7 million children have a parent in prison. ""We should be alarmed,"" said Georgia Lerner, executive director at the Women's Prison Association, a national nonprofit working with incarcerated women. ""Even when children have seen their mothers get arrested, they still want to be with their parents,"" Lerner said. ""They still love their mothers and want to be together."" While some critics argue that criminals make poor parents, experts said there is no doubt that separation from a parent, particularly a mother, affects a child's psychological development. When a father is imprisoned, the mother typically cares for the children, said Danielle Dallaire, a psychology professor at the College of William and Mary.  But her research shows that when a mother is incarcerated, the father often plays no role in raising the children left behind. Federal statistics show children are five times more likely to end up in foster care when a mother is sent to prison than when a father is imprisoned. Read the Federal Report . Belcher's grandmother, Williams, stepped in because she didn't want the child in foster care. The girl's father was not in the picture. For three years, Williams, a single mother herself, drove her granddaughter twice a month to see her mother. They never missed a visit, despite having to travel to several prisons across Kansas. After passing through the metal detectors and being frisked by security officers, the girl showed off the A's she received from school or told her mother about which boy had cooties. Each visit lasted two hours. Belcher often asked, ""When will you come home?"" ""Soon,"" her mother said. ""Soon.""  Find out what Taylor and her family learned from her time in prison » . A growing number of prisons are recognizing the need to preserve mother-child relationships. They have staffed nurseries and day care centers to keep families connected. Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, a maximum security women's prison in New York, is host to an annual summer camp run by volunteers. At camp, children can play basketball and participate in other activities with their incarcerated mothers. In May, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is reuniting moms and dads with their children. The ""Get on the Bus"" program provides 700 children with free rides to the prisons. The three years without Taylor were financially difficult for Williams, who was approaching retirement age. In her 50s at the time, she worked as a dental assistant to support her granddaughter. She poured all her time and effort into the quiet little girl. She packed her schedule with Girl Scouts and free summer camps, determined to make sure her granddaughter stayed out of trouble. ""Kids would tease me and say to me, 'Why is your mom so old?' "" Belcher recalled. Belcher was elated on May 29, 1991, when her mother returned to their home in Kansas City, Missouri, after serving three years of an eight-year sentence. Taylor got sober and attained her GED behind bars. She returned to find her 7-year-old daughter blossoming into her polar opposite. The girl put her head into books and graced the honor roll regularly. She didn't rebel. ""I wanted to be everything my mother wasn't,"" Belcher said. ""I loved my mom, but I couldn't do what she did."" ""I did it all,"" said Taylor, now 48. By 13, she skipped school frequently to attend ""hooky parties"" where she used drugs and alcohol. By 16, she dropped out of high school. ""When you're out there, you're out there."" The years after Taylor's release from prison also were tough on the mother-daughter relationship. As an adolescent, Belcher battled feelings of bitterness toward her mother and feared her mother would relapse. ""I felt angry,"" Belcher said, and the anger only grew during her high school years. ""It wasn't fair to me. Why did I have to have a mother like that?"" Belcher threw herself into academics and excelled. She knew that many children without parents often end up in trouble and behind bars themselves. She didn't want that for herself. ""She had a life where she could have just gave up, but she didn't do that,"" said Williams, now 71. ""She went straight ahead."" By 13, she was writing poetry. By 16, she was a track star at her high school and at the top of her class. She entered DePaul University in 2002 with nearly 50 scholarships. Belcher is a high school English teacher at Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, a college preparatory school that boasts alums like Michelle Obama. She has a cozy apartment in Chicago, Illinois -- her first home that is all her own. This summer, she will apply for grants to start her own nonprofit to help children of incarcerated parents stay out of trouble. Belcher said she admires her mother's resilience. She watched her search tirelessly for a job, despite her felony record. She is proud of her mother, who worked her way up to become a successful child care operator for the state of Minnesota after years of working in factories and fast food restaurants. Today, her mother resides in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and her grandmother still lives in Kansas City, Missouri. ""You can't always control life's circumstances, but you can control how you react to them,"" Belcher said.

"(CNN) -- The most ""complicated"" handmade watch in the world has been sold at auction for an historic $24.4 million. The Henry Graves Supercomplication timepiece, made by the luxury watchmaker Patek Philippe in 1933 for the prominent banker Henry Graves, was sold at Sotheby's in Switzerland. The sale smashed the world record for the most expensive watch ever sold at auction, which was previously held by the same watch. In 1999, it was sold to Sheikh Saud Bin Mohammed Bin Ali Al-Thani of the Qatari royal family, for $11 million. The watch was released in 2014 to coincide with the 175th anniversary of the Swiss watch maker. The sale has benefited from the boom in Patek Phillippe auction values over the last 15 years. The term ""complication"" is a technical one, and refers to any aspect of a watch that offers a function that is not simply telling the time. The timepiece -- which has been called ""the most important watch in the world,"" ""one of the wonders of the world,"" and ""the collector's holy grail"" -- boasts 24 such complications. These include grande and petite sonnerie (chimes), which emulate the bells of Westminster; a record of the phases and age of the moon; sunrise and sunset indications; a ""perpetual calendar"" that makes automatic adjustments for month and year; and a celestial map of the New York sky. The celestial map alone is a remarkable feat of engineering. It charts the precise spacing and density of the stars, and rotates at the same pace as the sky as it would have appeared from its owner's Fifth Avenue apartment. The watch is comprised of 900 individual parts, and, according to Sotheby's, is the most advanced timepiece ever made without the assistance of computers. It was last wound in 1969, yet remains in perfect working order. The Supercomplication was made as the result of a friendly competition between Graves, a member of a well-known banking family, and James Ward Packard, the luxury automobile manufacturer, to see who could produce the most impressive timepiece. Packard's attempt was a pioneering feat. It was the first ever watch to feature a sky chart, which included 500 golden stars and was centered above his home in Ohio. However, it contained just 10 complications, making Graves' timepiece the undisputed winner with 24. One of the Supercomplication's more obscure features is a sidereal time dial, which tracks the Earth's rate of rotation in relation to fixed stars. A ""sidereal day"", which is used by astronomers, lasts for 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds. It is unclear whether Graves had any use for the functionality. ""It's amazing that they did all that without computers,"" says Larry Pattinelli, the president of Patek Phillippe. ""You are talking about one of the most collectible pieces ever put up for auction, if not the most collectible."" The Supercomplication took Patek Phillipe eight years to produce, from its commission in 1925 to delivery in 1933. The identity of the new buyer is unknown.

"(CNN) -- ""How can Jon Stewart hire you to be 'The Daily Show''s senior Muslim correspondent when you don't even know how to pronounce Salaam Al-aikum?!"" This was the immediate reaction of Aasif Mandvi's father after Aasif told him the news. His father then quickly followed up that comment with the admonition, ""If Jon Stewart asks you any questions about Islam, don't say a word, tell him to call your mother, she knows everything. And don't embarrass your entire family from here to Mumbai ... oh, and by the way, we are very proud of you, congratulations."" It's not like Aasif didn't know anything about being a Muslim before he was hired by ""The Daily Show"" in 2006. But he wasn't that connected to his faith at the time. Something surprising happened, however, while working on the show for eight years. Jon Stewart made Aasif more Muslim-ish. In fact, Stewart did that to both of us. We don't mean in the religious sense. In fact, we wrote this article in a bar while drinking beer and eating bacon cheeseburger. (Okay, it's an O'Doul's ... and it's turkey bacon, but you get the point.) For millions of Muslims, including both of us, we are connected more culturally than religiously to our faith. It's not like Jon Stewart intentionally wanted us to become more Muslim. Aasif didn't come to work one day and find Jon sitting in his office holding up the Quran, saying, ""Mandvi, its time you start boning up on your Islam."" No, it was much more organic. In Aasif's case, covering Muslim topics for ""The Daily Show"" was the cause. You can read all about the experiences in hilarious detail in Aasif's new book of personal essays titled, ""No Land's Man."" (And yes, that was a shameless plug for the book.) For example, there was the time Aasif was sent to Murfreesboro, Tennessee, to cover a mosque controversy. There he encountered a woman opposed to the mosque who told him that, ""one in five Muslims were terrorists."" Aasif, who at first tried to counter her argument with facts to no avail, finally responded, ""Well, in that case I can't understand what is taking us so long!"" Another time the show created a parody sitcom of ""The Cosby Show"" titled, ""The Q'usoby Show,"" about an All-American Muslim family. The reaction from one of the people at the test screening of mostly non-Muslim New Yorkers was that the show didn't seem believable enough. When Aasif asked how it could be more so, one person responded with, ""What if they had a terrorist uncle who lived in the basement with a goat?"" These Daily Show experiences ""radicalized"" Aasif, turning him into, as he calls himself in the book, ""the jihadist of irony."" The more Aasif experienced hateful or simply ignorant comments about Islam, the more he felt compelled to counter the ignorance and bigotry with missiles of satire on behalf of a group of people who after 9/11 did not have the luxury of being both patriotic and critical of Islam at the same time: American Muslims. In Dean's case, Stewart agreed to be a part of the documentary he co-directed with Negin Farsad, ""The Muslims Are Coming!"" This film uses comedy to counter anti-Muslim bigotry. Stewart being in this film was a big deal. First, the last comedy film Jon had been in was ""Death to Smoochy."" We are talking years ago. But more importantly, with Jon's participation, the film was able to find the financing it needed. So over the next two years as the film was shot and edited, the sheer immersion in a Muslim-themed project increased Dean's connection to Islam. Of all the influences Stewart had on our ""conversion,"" the one that truly stands out occurred after death threats had been made against ""South Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for depicting an animated version of the Prophet Mohammed on their show. Stewart called Aasif on the phone -- which was the first time Jon ever had called him -- and asked, ""How would you feel about talking about the issue on the show as Muslim? Would you be okay with that?"" Aasif's father's words came immediately rushing back to him. Terrified, he thought for a moment and then asked Jon, ""Can I call my mother?"" Later that night, as Aasif was seated across from Stewart at ""The Daily Show"" desk waiting for the program to begin, Stewart leaned over and said to Aasif, ""Thanks for doing this, I know you were hesitant."" Aasif responded, ""It's just that I'm not the best Muslim and I can't speak for all of Islam."" As the show's theme music began to play, Jon whispered to Aasif, ""I know. But right now you're all we've got."" Sometimes being all ""we've got"" is all you need. And sometimes being all ""we've got"" pushes you, even subtly, to be better at it. That is what Stewart did to us. So today we both have Stewart to thank, at least in part, for being able to say that we are now more Muslim-ish than ever!","Aasif Mandvi, Dean Obeidallah: Jon Stewart made us more connected to our faith .

"(CNN) -- ""The Catcher in the Rye."" ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" ""The Satanic Verses."" The protest of controversial books is nothing new, but one particularly sensitive reader in Toronto issued a challenge over something a bit less sensational. That contentious tome: Dr. Seuss' ""Hop on Pop."" Although it's unclear whether the removal request was filed by an actual Grinch or intended in jest, the complaint stated that the book should be removed because it ""encourages children to use violence against their fathers."" The complaint further demanded that fathers be apologized to and reimbursed for any damages arising from children's reading of the book. According to Vickery Bowles, the director of collections management, the Toronto Public Library has a system for processing requests to remove books from its collection, though fewer than 100 have been filed since 2000. Of those, only five were actually removed ""because they contained inaccurate or dated information."" Among them was a children's book on dairy farming that had outdated farming information. Former first lady Laura Bush outlined the potential for violence in 2006. She said her children, when very small, actually took the book to literally mean they should jump on their father. President George W. Bush was reportedly uninjured in the incident. In addressing the complaint, the library pointed out that the book is included on many ""best of"" lists for children and that Dr. Seuss is a Pulitzer Prize-winning author. However, one particular argument was probably the death knell for this request: ""The children are actually told not to hop on Pop."" The only words uttered by the eponymous Pop in the 390-word title are an admonition to refrain from such activity: ""STOP. You must not hop on Pop."" The request was officially denied, and ""Hop on Pop"" remains in the library's collection.","Complaint said ""Hop on Pop"" encouraged violence against fathers .

"(CNN) -- A French author whose tales center on memory and guilt has won this year's Nobel Prize in literature, the Nobel committee in Sweden said Thursday. Patrick Modiano, 69, is the 11th Nobel literature prize winner born in France. He is being honored ""for the art of memory with which he has evoked the most ungraspable human destinies and uncovered the life-world of the occupation,"" the committee said. Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, said Modiano was ""well known in France, but pretty well not anywhere else."" Born in 1945, Modiano has published some 30 books, mainly novels -- for which he is chiefly known -- but also some children's books and movie scripts. His novels tend to be short, often 130 to 150 pages in length, and written in simple language, Englund said, but they are refined and elegant in nature. ""They are always versions of the same theme -- about memory, about loss, about identity, about seeking,"" he said. Modiano, who published his first novel in 1968, has previously been recognized with some of the most prestigious prizes in French literature, including the Prix Goncourt in 1978. Englund's own recommendation? The novel ""Missing Person,"" which plays with the detective genre as its protagonist, who has lost his memory, seeks to find out who he really is. The Swedish committee has not yet been able to reach Modiano to tell him of his win, he added. Troubled past . In a 2011 interview with the cultural journal France Today, Modiano said of writing, ""Actually, I never thought of doing anything else."" The child of a Belgian mother and an Italian Jewish father, his was a difficult, fragmented childhood, the journal says. His experiences are recounted in his memoir, ""Un Pedigree,"" published in 2005. His works are infused with questions of identity, often tied in with France's troubled past during the Nazi Occupation. ""After each novel, I have the impression that I have cleared it all away,"" he told France Today. ""But I know I'll come back over and over again to tiny details, little things that are part of what I am. In the end, we are all determined by the place and the time in which we were born."" Sticking with familiar themes, he also made the 1974 movie ""Lacombe, Lucien"" with director Louis Malle, which was set during the Occupation. His latest work is the novel ""Pour que tu ne te perdes pas dans le quartier,"" published this month. The Nobel Prize in literature has been awarded 107 times since 1901. It is almost always awarded to one author and has been shared only four times, which stands in contrast to the science Nobels, which two or three scientists often share. The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday, followed by the award for achievements in economics Monday.","French author Patrick Modiano wins the Nobel Prize for literature .

"(CNN) -- A terrifying road rage incident involving a gang of bikers on Manhattan's west side has gone viral on the web after video of the incident surfaced online. The New York City Police Department said a man driving a Range Rover with his wife and 2-year-old daughter inside Sunday struck a motorcyclist on Manhattan's West Side Highway, breaking his leg. ""It was an accident,"" says Lt. Karen Anderson. The SUV driver pulled over, and the bikers surrounded his vehicle, hitting it and spiking the tires, police said. The driver pulled away, hitting three more bikers in the process, police said. The gang, called ""Hollywood Stuntz,"" according to police, chased the man, and he was forced to stop because of flat tires. The SUV driver was cornered and beaten, according to police. He was later treated at a local hospital for slashes to his face and released. His wife and child were not injured. One biker who was struck by the SUV, 28-year-old Christopher Cruz, was arrested and faces several charges, including reckless endangerment, reckless driving and endangering the welfare of a child, police said. Authorities have not identified the people in the SUV. A helmet camera one of the bikers was wearing captured much of the road rage incident, including the moment when one of the bikers walks up to the SUV and smashes its window with a bike helmet. The video has been posted online. Police say this same group of bikers descended on New York City and clogged up Times Square last year in what Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said is a ""major stunt event."" Authorities say they were able to prevent the group from entering Times Square this year. Police arrested 15 bikers in total Sunday, seized 55 bikes and wrote 68 summons for various violations. They are looking at video footage to try to determine if any other charges will be filed in the road rage incident.

"Moore, Oklahoma (CNN) -- A search-and-rescue effort to find survivors of a monster tornado that pulverized a vast swath of the suburbs of Oklahoma City shifted Tuesday to one of recovery, officials said. No new survivors or bodies have been found since the early hours after the tornado carved a trail 17 miles long on Monday afternoon. ""We feel like we have basically gone from rescue and searching to recovery,"" Glenn Lewis, the mayor of hard-hit Moore, told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Lewis said he didn't expect the death toll to climb any higher. At least 24 people, including nine children, were killed, according to the state medical examiner's office. ""I think that will stand,"" Lewis said. Earlier reports of at least 51 deaths were erroneous, said Amy Elliot, chief administrative officer for the Oklahoma Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. In the chaotic aftermath of the tornado, Elliot said it appeared some of the dead were counted twice. Snapshot of courage after tornado levels school . 'One of the strongest storms' Damage assessments conducted Tuesday showed the tornado packed winds, at times, between 200 and 210 miles per hour, making it an EF5 -- the strongest category of tornadoes measured, the National Weather Service said Tuesday. Teams are still evaluating the destruction, and the rating released Tuesday is preliminary. So far, they've found that the tornado's width spanned 1.3 miles -- the length of more than 22 football fields lined up end-to-end. Given its breadth and power, it ranks among some of the strongest storms ever to strike the United States, CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said. Hardest hit was Moore, Oklahoma -- a suburban town of about 56,000 and the site of eerily similar twisters in 1999 and again four years later. The scene -- block after block of flattened homes and businesses, the gutted remains of a hospital and hits on two elementary schools -- left even seasoned veterans of Oklahoma's infamous tornadoes reeling. The devastation was so complete, the mayor said city officials were racing to print new street signs to help guide rescuers and residents through a suddenly twisted and unfamiliar landscape. A search-and-rescue team was sent from nearby Tinker Air Force Base, which also provided search lights, vehicles and water trucks, while neighboring Texas sent an elite 80-member urban search team. The American Red Cross sent 25 emergency response vehicles. Rescue crews were expected to complete a search for victims by late Tuesday, Moore Fire Chief Gary Bird told CNN. ""We will be through every damaged piece of property in this city at least three times,"" Bird told reporters. ""And we hope to be done by dark tonight."" More than 230 people were injured, according to authorities. The path of the storm . 'Can't believe this' Some residents of Moore returned home to piles of debris, hoping to find pictures or some memento. ""You just wanna break down and cry,"" Steve Wilkerson told CNN, holding a laundry basket that contained the few, intact belongings he could find. ""But you know, that's how it goes,"" Wilkerson said, his voice shaking. ""You gotta be strong and keep going."" Wilkerson has been through tornadoes before, but nothing like this one. ""I still can't believe this is happening,"" he said. ""You work 20 years, and then it's gone in 15 minutes."" All that remained in some places were ""sticks and bricks,"" Fallin told reporters, calling the storm one of the ""most horrific storms and disasters that this state has ever faced."" Police, firefighters, volunteers and nearly 180 National Guard troops joined forces Tuesday in searching the rubble and securing areas hit by the storm. The weather wasn't cooperating with their efforts: National Weather Service crews surveying the damage in Moore reported rain, half-inch hail and 45-mph winds over the debris field. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol asked motorists to steer clear of Interstate 35 near Moore to free up lanes for disaster response resources streaming into the area. And so many people were showing up to volunteer that authorities had to plead with would-be rescuers to stay away. Path of devastation . The tornado struck at 2:45 pm C.T. on Monday -- only 5 minutes after the first warnings went out, according to the National Weather Service. Moore residents had about 30 minutes before the massive storm entered the western part of the city, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Eerily similar tornado in 1999 . Among the many buildings struck by the storm were two schools: Plaza Towers and Briarwood elementaries. Of the nine children killed by the storm, authorities said seven died at Plaza Towers Elementary School where the tornado ripped the roof off and collapsed walls. Among the dead is 9-year-old Ja'Nae Hornsby, who was killed at Plaza Towers, her father told CNN's Anderson Cooper. About 75 students and staff members were hunkered down in Plaza Towers when the tornado struck, CNN affiliate KFOR reported. At one point, an estimated 24 children were missing from the school, but some later turned up at nearby churches. On Monday, a father of a third-grader still missing sat quietly on a stool outside. Tears cascaded from his face as he waited for any news. Even parents of survivors couldn't wrap their minds around the tragedy. ""I'm speechless. How did this happen? Why did this happen?"" Norma Bautista asked. ""How do we explain this to the kids? ... In an instant, everything's gone."" 'I love you,' teacher tells students . 'It's heartbreaking' James Dickens, a gas-and-oil pipeline worker, grabbed his hard had and joined other rescuers at Plaza Towers Elementary School. ""I felt it was my duty to come help,"" he said Tuesday after a long night of searching. ""As a father, it's humbling. It's heartbreaking to know that we've still got kids over there that's possibly alive, but we don't know."" Track current severe weather . Moore, and the Oklahoma City region, are far too familiar with disaster. In 1995, 168 people died in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. In 1999 and then again in 2003, Moore took direct hits from tornadoes that took eerily similar paths to Monday's storm. The 1999 storm packed the strongest wind speeds in history, Lt. Gov. Todd Lamb said. ""We're a tough state. This is a tough community,"" Lamb said. ""There is hope. We always have hope. We always have faith."" President Barack Obama, pledging whatever federal aid Oklahoma would need, praised teachers who protected their students. ""If there is hope to hold on to -- not just in Oklahoma but around the country -- it's the knowledge that the good people there and in Oklahoma are better prepared for this type of storm than most,"" he said. ""And what they can be certain of is that Americans from every corner of this country will be right there with them, opening our homes, our hearts, to those in need, because we're a nation that stands with our fellow citizens as long as it takes."" 10 deadliest tornadoes on record . More trouble brewing . The storm system that spawned Monday's tornado and several other twisters Sunday isn't over yet. Southwest Arkansas and northeast Texas, including Dallas, are under the gun for severe weather Tuesday. Those areas could see large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes. A broader swath of the United States, from Texas to Indiana and up to Michigan, could see severe thunderstorms. ""We could have a round 3,"" CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said. ""Hopefully, it won't be as bad."" Severe weather 101 . CNN's Michael Pearson and Chelsea J. Carter wrote and reported from Atlanta, and Brian Todd reported from Moore.

"(CNN) -- It was a game that featured one of the most expensively assembled casts a Manchester derby has ever seen. Quite rightly, it was settled by one of the most valuable forwards in world football. Sergio Aguero's second half strike was enough to give Manchester City a closely fought 1-0 victory over a Manchester United side that played the majority of this tense match with ten men after Chris Smalling was sent off late in the first period. The result marks a fourth consecutive derby victory for City and keeps them on the tails of second placed Southampton in the Premier League standings. ""All the games are (worth) three points but it's important to win the derby,"" City manager Manuel Pelligrini told Sky Sports after the match. ""It's a special moment to win against Manchester United."" Pellegrini's men have struggled in recent weeks, losing to Newcastle United and West Ham in domestic competitions whilst drawing with CSKA Moscow in the Champions League. But City showed admirable grit to shut out their cross-town opponents Sunday after coming under real pressure in the closing stages. ""They (United) played well towards the end,"" City captain Vincent Kompany said. ""We had most of the chances but you miss a couple and you can seem to lose control of the game. ""The derby win is massive. For a minute, the league doesn't matter. It is a boost for us and we will do our job again in the Champions League on Wednesday."" City's recent dominance in this fixture now makes the big spending ""noisy neighbors"" accusation once leveled by former United manager Alex Ferguson seem a long time ago. If anything, the big spending tag is now more apt for United. The Red Devils trumped City and all others in the Premier League this close season by splashing out over $239 million on new talent like Angel Di Maria, Radamel Falcao, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, Ander Herrera and Daley Blind to aid new manager Louis Van Gaal's assault on the title. City were hardly penny pinchers themselves, however, bringing in the likes of Eliquiam Malanga, Fernando and Willy Caballero at a combined cost of $78 million, but were more restrained in the market than in years gone by. It was one of the mainstays of the light blues recent triumphs, himself a $60 million signing from Atletico Madrid back in 2011, who would settle this affair. Aguero looked lively all afternoon, testing David De Gea early on with a rasping strike from a tight angle and then forcing the United keeper into a brave block later in the half. When Smalling was sent off, after picking up a second booking for a lunging tackle on James Milner that Van Gaal later described as ""not very smart,"" it looked like the lively Argentine would find more space against United's depleted back line. While that didn't exactly turn out to be the case, as United still created more than their fair share of chances, he was to prove the difference just after the hour mark. Gael Clichy was expertly played through by Yaya Toure before cutting the ball back for Aguero to sweep the ball high beyond De Gea. It was a typically smart Aguero goal, displaying nifty movement to step away from his marker to create the space for the pull back. United reacted by pushing forward despite their numerical disadvantage and came close through efforts from Robin Van Persie and Marouane Fellaini. City still created chances of their own, however. Jesus Navas cracked the upright after a clever through ball from Toure while Stevan Jovetic made De Gea work after shooting from the edge of the box. With time running out Wayne Rooney burst through the City defense and claimed to have been brought down by the covering Martin Demichelis. Referee Michael Oliver remained unmoved and when the ball broke to Di Maria, the Argentine's shot was brilliantly saved low down to his right by Hart. It was to be the last clear cut chance of the match as City closed out to maintain their local dominance.","Manchester City defeat Manchester United 1-0 .

"(CNN) -- Which country has the highest-priced hotels? The immediate answer is the Maldives, according to Hotels.com's recently released Hotel Price Index. But the real takeaway is that for the past few years hotel prices have been rising across the globe, no matter which country you choose to visit. The average room rate rose by an average of 3% in 2012, according to Hotels.com. Thankfully, there are plenty of savvy ways to save money on a hotel room today -- you just need to know the insider tricks. Many have to do with navigating the increasingly complex landscape of online booking. You'll find start-up websites such as Tingo, which offers automatic refunds when a room rate drops. DealAngel, meanwhile, will help you decide if that online find is really such a steal. And all the major booking sites are embracing ""bundling"" as a way to drop rates. See more of Travel + Leisure's money-saving hotel tips . Bundling . Hotels drop prices to unprecedented lows when they can ""hide"" their room rates from the general public. One way they do it: bundling rooms with airfares through online travel agents such as Expedia, Orbitz, and Travelocity. In a recent test, we searched for round-trip tickets from New York City to Los Angeles with a seven-night hotel stay at the Ritz-Carlton, Marina del Rey. Bought separately, we'd have had to pay $2,367. Bundled on Travelocity, however, we'd pay $632 less -- a 20% savings. Club floors .

All you need is a Wi-Fi or mobile hot spot and you're good to go. Travel + Leisure: Best U.S. cities for affordable getaways . Refunds . The new website Tingo makes it extremely easy to get a partial refund if your hotel rate drops. Book a refundable room through the site, which monitors the price. If the rate goes down, Tingo will automatically refund the difference to your credit card shortly after your stay. Social media . Three ways to use social media to get a better hotel stay. 1) Tweet the property before booking to see if any special deals are available. Hotels often broadcast deals on social media first. You can also do a keyword search (hotel name and ""deal"") on Twitter. 2) Introduce yourself to the hotel on Facebook and Twitter, and let the staff know how excited you are about your upcoming trip. You might be rewarded with a free upgrade. 3) ""Like"" hotel loyalty programs on sites such as Facebook and Pinterest to get updates on extra savings, such as the regular 24-hour Facebook flash sales for Hilton HHonors members. Timing . If you're looking for savings, timing is everything. We asked Smith Travel Research for a month-by-month look at average room rates for destinations across the United States. New York City prices, for instance, drop in July and August, while Phoenix peaks at about $150 per night in October. On Oahu, hotel prices decline by about $20 per night between early January and early February. Wi-Fi . At high-end hotels, free Wi-Fi remains frustratingly scarce. According to the American Hotel & Lodging Association, 84% of luxury hotels charge for in-room Internet access, while just 8 percent of economy hotels do. Here, Travel + Leisure acknowledges the upscale hotel brands that provide the best Internet service. First Place: Peninsula and Shangri-La Hotels have free Wi-Fi not only in all hotel rooms and common areas but also in their automobile fleets. Second Place: Andaz provides free in-room and lobby Internet access. Third Place: Fairmont, Kimpton and Omni hotels offer complimentary Wi-Fi in common areas and guest rooms if you join their (free) loyalty programs.

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Brazil's presidential vote is headed for a runoff. Preliminary election results from the South American country show President Dilma Rousseff in the lead. But she didn't get the majority necessary to win in the first round. With more than 99% of votes counted, Rousseff had 41.56% of votes, Brazil's Supreme Electoral Court said. Aecio Neves was in second place with 33.60%. And Marina Silva was in third place with 21.30%. Exit polls Sunday indicated there would be a runoff between Rousseff, the incumbent, and Neves, a center-right candidate. In a poll conducted by the Ibope public research firm, Rousseff won 44% of votes, Neves won 30% and Silva won 22%. Silva, an environmentalist candidate for the Brazilian Socialist Party, had gained momentum and backing from a growing number of supporters leading up to the vote, with polls before the election placing her in second place. She joined the race after candidate Eduardo Campos died in a plane crash and was seen as a political outsider who could combat corruption. But while she succeeded in gaining much broader support that polls had initially predicted for her party, her third-place finish puts her out of the running for the presidency. Rousseff, 66, was once a Marxist rebel who was allegedly tortured in the early 1970s during Brazil's former dictatorship. With her trademark pixie-short hair style and thick glasses, she became one of most Brazil's most wanted fugitives, branded by some as a ""subversive Joan of Arc."" She has a solid track record in running the executive office. Before becoming the country's first female president in 2011, Rousseff, from the Workers' Party, was chief of staff to former President Lula da Silva. She democratized Brazil's electricity sector through the ""Luz Para Todos"" (Light for All) program, which made electricity widely available, even in rural areas. Rousseff presided over the soccer World Cup in Brazil, but she took a lot of political flack over how public money was spent. Streets filled with hundreds of thousands of demonstrators questioning the morality of pumping so much money into stadiums instead of programs to fight poverty and build infrastructure. Rousseff defended the spending, saying the vast majority of funds earmarked for infrastructure projects were spent on projects for the nation, not the soccer tournament. And Rousseff claims that under the presidencies of her predecessor and herself, masses of Brazilians have risen out of poverty. ""We have also mainstreamed into the middle class no less than 42 million people,"" she has said. But inflation is now weighing down that progress. Neves, a 54-year-old economist, is a well-known name and a career politician. His campaign slogan promises reforms to lower inflation and encourage more investment in the country: ""The sure path for Brazil to really change."" The pro-business candidate belongs to the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, one of the country's strongest. His grandfather, Tancredo Neves, was elected to become Brazil's president in 1985 but died before taking office. Neves says he began his political career campaigning at his grandfather's side. ""What motivates me in politics is an enormous love of Brazil, a limitless desire to see things improve, to see Brazil go the right way,"" he says in a campaign video. While he'd been trailing in some polls leading up to the election, Neves said the only poll that mattered was Sunday's official vote. ""Let's get to the second round,"" he said in a YouTube video on Saturday. Both Rousseff and Neves thanked supporters in speeches Sunday night. Rousseff has promised her second term will be different, running under the slogan of ""New Government, New Ideas."" ""Once again, the people have honored me with their trust by giving me victory in the first round,"" she said. A video posted on Neves' Twitter feed Sunday night showed cheering supporters carrying him as cameras flashed. This has been one of the tightest election competitions in recent years, and it's likely to intensify in the coming weeks, with both candidates vying for the votes that went to Silva in the first round. There will be three more weeks of campaigning before the runoff. CNN's Shasta Darlington reported from Sao Paulo. Catherine E. Shoichet and Ben Brumfield reported and wrote from Atlanta.","NEW: With more than 99% of votes counted, Dilma Rousseff has more than 41% of votes .

"Washington (CNN) -- An American trafficked thousands of grenade components to Mexico, many of which turned up in hands of drug cartel who used them in violent attacks, and federal agents were prevented from stopping it, in part because federal prosecutors wouldn't bring charges. Those are the finding of a new Justice Department inspector general report to be released Thursday. It harshly criticizes prosecutors in the Phoenix U.S. attorney's office and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Read the DOJ Inspector General's report . The report cites some of the same officials who were part of the botched Operation Fast and Furious, which allowed suspected arms traffickers to buy thousands of firearms, many of which ended up used in cartel violence. Jean Baptiste Kingery, an American from Arizona, was the suspect in the grenades case. He was arrested in 2011, in Mexico and has been charged with violating that nation's organized-crime laws. Related: ATF probes ties between grenade in Mexico and American . Authorities then found his alleged grenade factory where they discovered parts that could have been used to manufacture about a 1,000 grenades. But that arrest only came months after ATF agents tried several times to arrest him, only to have prosecutors refuse to bring charges, according to the IG report and documents reviewed by CNN but not included in the report. Prosecutors argued that possessing hundreds of grenade hulls, commonly sold in U.S. military surplus stores as novelties, weren't necessarily a crime. Unlike, Fast and Furious, agents in the Kingery case worked with Mexican law enforcement to try to conduct a sting operation to stop Kingery. But Mexican officers missed him and he managed to get across the border with his cargo of grenade hulls. The Justice Department said in a statement: ""In the six years since this operation was begun, we have taken aggressive action to ensure these errors are not repeated. The department does not condone the conduct that occurred during this investigation, and those individuals identified by the report as responsible for the operation have either been reassigned or left the department.""

"(CNN) -- Same-sex marriage became a reality on Thursday in Nevada, creating a nationwide majority of states allowing gays and lesbians to legally wed. West Virginia is expected to start soon. In Nevada, a private group that had led the legal fight to defend the voter-approved ban suddenly withdrew its pending appeal for a stay with the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices on Thursday quickly removed that case from their docket, apparently removing the last legal hurdle to allowing gay and lesbian couples to legally wed in the Silver State. Hours later, Nevada state Sen. Kelvin Atkinson tweeted at katkinson702 that he'd just tied the knot with his partner of more than six years, Sherwood Howard. ""It's done, we are married! Amazing! What a 48 hours! @ballerwoody is my Husband! We were the first same sex couple to wed in the state of Nevada! Here we are on the court steps with one of my favorite judges, with a LOT of cameras and media around! #progress #lgbt #equality #marriage"" In West Virginia, Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, a Democrat, announced Thursday he would not challenge federal court rulings on same-sex marriage, clearing the way for the practice to begin statewide. ""West Virginia will uphold the law according to these rulings, and I have directed state agencies to take appropriate action to make that possible,"" he said in a statement. ""I encourage all West Virginians -- regardless of their personal beliefs-- to uphold our statewide tradition of treating one another with dignity and respect."" The Mountain State's Health and Human Resources Department later said county clerks would begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples by Tuesday ""at the latest."" Nearly 3,000 same-sex couples live West Virginia, according to UCLA's Williams Institute, a think tank conducting research on sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy . This follows the Supreme Court's refusal Monday to intervene in legal challenges over voter-approved bans in five states: Virginia, Utah, Oklahoma, Indiana and Wisconsin. That meant three separate appeals court rulings striking down those bans as unconstitutional would go into effect quickly in those states, as well as six others covered by those courts' jurisdiction. That would include West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming. Some states and localities are moving faster than others to abide by those rulings. Colorado's attorney general and the state's highest court on Tuesday ended all pending legal obstacles, allowing same-sex marriage to begin there. A judge Wednesday in Johnson County, Kansas -- the state's largest county -- also ordered same-sex licenses to be issued. But the South Carolina Supreme Court put things on hold while it continues to review the matter, meaning no licenses will be issued to same-sex couples in the Palmetto State. That request for a stay on enforcement came from state officials. West Virginia would become the 27th state to allow same-sex marriage, up from 19 states just a week ago. The number could top 35 in coming weeks, as other states move to enforce federal court orders. The issue had been initially uncertain in Nevada after a federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled bans in Nevada and neighboring Idaho were unconstitutional. The judges on that panel later that evening ordered same-sex marriages to begin immediately, but parties in Idaho and later Nevada separately asked the high court for emergency action, to put things on hold while the appeals process continued. Nevada officials had delayed issuing marriage licenses on Tuesday to same-sex couples because of initial confusion from the Supreme Court over whether the state had such authority. The Idaho application is still pending at the high court. Nevada's legal situation was somewhat unique. A federal judge had initially ruled Nevada's ban on same-sex marriage could stand, but the state attorney general later refused to defend the law in court, saying it would likely be struck down by the federal appeals court. A three-judge panel of 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did just that in a sweeping ruling earlier this week. State senator pops the question after Nevada's gay marriage ban falls . Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, in February had said that for a variety of procedural and precedential reasons, ""It has become clear that this case is no longer defensible in court."" A private group, the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage, then stepped in to defend the 2002 voter referendum, known as Question 2. That was the group that withdrew its appeal to the high court Thursday. There are an estimated 7,000 or more same-sex couples in Nevada, according to the Williams Institute. The Nevada case at the Supreme Court is Coalition for the Protection of Marriage v. Sevcik (14a378). Here is a listing of the 26 states that allow same-sex marriage, following the Supreme Court's decision Monday not to review lower court rulings striking down voter-approved bans: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington state and Wisconsin, plus the District of Columbia. Nine more states could soon legalize it, after federal appeals courts issued binding mandates in recent months: Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, North Carolina, Montana, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming.","NEW: In Nevada, state senator and partner become first same-sex couple to wed .

"(CNN) -- Alfonso Ribeiro didn't make us wait long before he revived ""The Carlton"" on ""Dancing With the Stars."" On Monday night, the former ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" star dusted off his old familiar moves in week four of the competition. The theme of the week was ""Most Memorable Year,"" and ""Dancing"" saved the best for last. After watching the other nine celebrities and their pro dancing partners run through sambas, rumbas and jives, Ribeiro and pro dancer Witney Carson took the floor with a jazz routine set to Tom Jones' ""It's Not Unusual"" -- a.k.a. the song that Ribeiro's ""Fresh Prince"" character, Carlton Banks, couldn't help but dance to. Dressed in a costume straight out of his ""Fresh Prince's"" character's closet -- a v-neck sweater and a bow tie -- Ribeiro looked like he was having a blast re-creating those exuberant dance steps along with Carson. The judges were thrilled, giving the couple a perfect score. Ribeiro acknowledged that playing Will Smith's dorkier cousin during ""Fresh Prince's"" six-season run in the '90s did leave him pigeonholed as an actor, but he has no grudge against the dance that's come to bear his character's name. ""I love the Carlton dance. I love how it makes people feel,"" he said in an interview. ""I certainly don't do it a lot. But I love the fact that people have this nostalgic look at that dance. ...

"Nogales, Mexico (CNN) -- Their journey through the desert ended in the back of a U.S. Border Patrol van. Sitting inside the chapel of the San Juan Bosco shelter for deportees in Nogales, Mexico, Rey and Herlinda rest and wait for another chance to cross illegally into the United States with their children ages 4, 9 and 11 in tow. Temperatures in this stretch of desert that straddles the U.S.-Mexico border hover around 100 degrees. ""I know that I'm putting all three of them at risk, but what else can I do?"" said Rey, who says he has lived and worked in the United States without authorization on and off for the past 27 years. Until recently, he kept his family in Mexico, but he says he can no longer afford to sustain two households. ""What's the motivation? When one of my kids asks for meat or (candy), I cannot just say no,"" Rey added. ""Mexico never changes. There was poverty when I left in 1986 and nothing has changed."" The deadliest trip in America? The hundreds of thousands of immigrants like Rey and Herlinda have tried to cross illegally into the United States over the past two years, even as the government steps up investments in manpower and technology to secure the nation's borders. More than 150 end up dead every year. Thousands more get deported every month, according to U.S. Customs and Border and Protection figures. But would-be immigrants keep coming. ""People are still driven by economic necessity to come to the United States by whatever means they can. Some come to join family members already here, others because they are hungry,"" said Isabel Garcia, a public defender and a co-chair of the Tucson, Arizona-based Coalition for Human Rights. ""But the fact is that very few are prepared for such a hard trip. Many have to survive days and days in the desert,"" she said, ""and they can never carry enough water."" Some make it past the desert and go on to find jobs in the United States. But on the Mexican side of the border, deportations from the United States have become so common that shelters and businesses have opened up, catering to people who've gotten kicked out of the United States. Others come back bruised, robbed by smugglers or worse, says Hilda Irene Loureiro, a Mexican merchant who runs the shelter. Loureiro says she opened up the San Juan Bosco shelter after seeing deportees huddle in the back of her shop which is located just a few blocks from the fence that divides her city from Nogales, Arizona. She decided to build a place for them to spend a few days in safety. Dozens of migrants arrive each day at her shelter for food and a chance to sleep on a soft mattress. Most of the time, she says, they leave not to go back to their homes, but to try and cross into the United States again. ""They come here from all over Mexico, but now there are lots Central Americans looking to leave their countries,"" she said. The shelter houses more than 50,000 migrants each year. They can stay for up to three days, free of charge. Its three sleeping areas house 145 bunks, but on any given night up to 360 migrants stay there, finding room to sleep on the floor of the dining room or the chapel. Portraits of saints and other religious icon fill the chapel, where travelers say their prayers before chancing the desert again. As the national debate over immigration reform heats up, border security is a top issue on many lawmakers' agendas. But from her point of view at the border, Loureiro says she doesn't think any efforts in Washington to boost border security will have much of an impact on whether people make the dangerous journey. ""The migrants are going to continue trying to get to the other side of the border no matter what. They will do this regardless of danger or consequence,"" Loureiro said. ""They will do it because they lack economic opportunities in Mexico and they lack the education and (job) skills to get ahead."" According to the office of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in fiscal year 2013 a total of 414,397 undocumented immigrants were apprehended after crossing the border illegally into the United States. The previous year, the figure was 356,873. Arizona desert: Gateway to dreams or graveyard? For those who make it across the border, it isn't an easy journey. Thousands of would-be immigrants have died in the desert of southern Arizona in the past 10 years, according to the Pima County Medical Examiner's Office. Most of them die after suffering dehydration in the summer or fall to hypothermia in the winter. The trek can often last days, as smugglers take them through remote paths in order to avoid detection by the Border Patrol. Wild animals roam the area at night and the people the migrants paid to get them safely across often turn on them, robbing them of their money and abusing the women before abandoning them, according to authorities. ""Many fall into the abuses of the smugglers, sexual abuse,"" said Manuel Padilla, head of the Border Patrol's Tucson sector. ""The only thing that matters to them is money, not people."" Padilla said Border Patrol agents often spot and rescue immigrants stranded in the desert, which is an important part of the agency's job. However, the agency also focuses on prevention, by educating would-be immigrants of the dangers involved in trying to cross the border illegally. They ask foreign diplomats at consulates in the United States to spread the word in their countries about the dangers of illegal border crossings, and they try to get the word out in Spanish-language media, Padilla said. Even so, the phenomenon of deaths in the desert has become so bad that one group of investigators labeled it a ""humanitarian crisis at the border."" According to the Pima County Medical Examiner's Office, in 2012 the bodies of 157 migrants were recovered in the desert. In 2013, the remains of 169 people were found there. ""Since 2001 we've had around 2,200 immigrant deaths,"" most of them Mexican citizens, said Gregory Hess, the Pima County medical examiner. ""When we find only a bone in the desert, a femur ... or an arm, it's not here for long... we take photographs and measurements and DNA"" samples. Unclaimed bodies and bones are buried or cremated after about a year, he said. Searching for clues . Since a majority of the bodies belong to Mexican citizens, morgue staff are in regular contact with the Mexican Consulate in Tucson. It isn't the job Jeronimo Garcia thought he was signing up for when he joined the Mexican Foreign Service. But now he's become so used to handling human remains that he no longer feels the need to wear a surgical mask to protect himself from the stench of death. The consulate employee has become a go-to person for American authorities when it comes to finding clues about the immigrants' identities. Garcia has earned the trust of U.S. officials because of his track record over the past 12 years, helping to identify dozens of bodies. ""(This one) has dental work. Sometimes teeth give us clues as to where they come from,"" Garcia said as he examined cadavers and bones at the Pima County morgue. ""Central Americans, particularly Guatemalans, often have ornamental work done. They put copper stars on their teeth."" Migrants sometimes sew documents into their underclothes, or conceal strips of paper with the telephone number of a contact in the United States or their country of origin, he says. This information can be a solid clue to track down identity. After the extensive search at the morgue, the bodies are labeled and stored in a freezer. Personal effects and identifications are also stored, as any clue could lead to the identification of a cadaver. Sometimes, there aren't many clues. If all that Garcia and the medical examiner's office have to go on is a set of dry bones, DNA testing is the only viable option. The Mexican Consulate sometimes pays for the tests when Mexican citizens are involved. For immigrants from other countries, the medical examiner's office relies on its growing ties with the New York-based Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team. The organization, which started out trying to identify remains of dissidents killed during Argentina's brutal military dictatorship, now has also collected more than 1,700 DNA samples from families in Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala in efforts to help find missing migrants. So far, they've identified 65 bodies. ""This is never a happy ending. ... We just try to reduce the time that families have to prolong their pain,"" said Mercedes Doretti, who directs the organization. ""What it means is ending the uncertainty of the family not knowing what happened to their relative, the suffering that everyone goes through."" Journalist Julian Resendiz contributed to this report.","Despite perils of the desert, many immigrants still risk the journey .

"(CNN) -- My grandfather Jacques Cousteau and my father Philippe dedicated their lives to revealing the ocean's wonders and helping us understand our connection to this vast expanse of water. Their work inspired generations and filled people with awe. Times have changed and so have circumstances and perceptions about the ocean. In recent years, the focus has been on the very serious challenges the ocean faces and the impact these challenges are already having on our daily lives. The effects of climate change, pollution and overfishing should be making headlines because the ocean and all of us -- and I literally mean all humankind -- who depend on its resources are facing the very real prospect of the catastrophic collapse of ocean ecosystems if we continue on our current course. Watch: Going Green: Oceans on Friday March 29 at 15:30 GMT . Despite the challenges our ocean faces, I believe it's time to recapture the sense of wonder and inspiration my grandfather and father felt when they gazed on its surface. In fact, the ocean can and should be a source of hope and solutions for a brighter future. Before you accuse of me of eschewing cold hard reality for a world view through rose-colored glasses, hear me out. What I'm proposing is that we step back and look at the potential a healthy ocean has to provide us with a prosperous and sustainable future. Just take a moment to think about what the ocean does for us on a daily basis: it produces half of the world's oxygen; it provides more than one billion people with their primary source of protein; its natural eco-systems like coral reefs, mangroves and wetlands provide protection against coastal erosion and natural disasters such as tsunamis; it regulates our climate; and a healthy ocean fuels sustainable businesses and a strong economy in industries such as seafood, tourism, pharmaceuticals and shipping. Read/Watch: 'The most imaginative person I've ever met' That's really only the beginning. Check out Ocean Conservancy's ""Why the Ocean Matters"" feature if you want to be truly amazed. My point is the answers to many of our greatest environmental and social challenges literally surrounds us. For the ocean to continue to do what's it's done for millions of years and serve the needs of a rapidly expanding human population, it needs to be healthy. Biodiversity, coral reefs, wetlands and trash-free seas aren't just terms on a page they are environmental imperatives that dictate the future of the planet. We have the know-how and resources to conserve and restore the aquatic and marine systems that keep the ocean and us healthy. As my grandfather once said, ""The technology that we use to abuse the planet is the same technology that can help us to heal it."" Big technology like renewable energy, carbon sequestration and advances in aquaculture certainly have a major role in restoring the ocean and the planet to a healthy balance, but in many cases it's a matter of giving nature the space and time to do what it needs to do with a helping hand from all of us. Regulations that help replenish and protect fish stocks, restoration and conservation projects to protect and nurture natural barriers like reefs and wetlands, and reforestation efforts are all things that can have a huge impact on ocean health with no rocket science necessary. Take fisheries for example, with two billion people joining us on this planet over the next 40 years, there will be a huge need for more sources of protein. If these needed protein sources were to come primarily from livestock there is the very real potential for catastrophic pollution of water and land, not to mention the exponential increase in carbon emissions. But, by some estimates, simply managing fisheries better could feed up to one billion of those people and remember, seafood is 7-10 times more efficient as a source of protein than land-based meat sources ... if managed properly. If you are thinking this all sounds like the future of the ocean is in the hands of policymakers and big industry, please think again. Every hour of every day each of us have the opportunity to make choices with impact, from what we eat and the things we buy to the examples we set for our children and friends. The good news is technology and future-focused groups are providing us with some great tools and resources to get inspired and make smart decisions. For example: the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch pocket guide and Ocean Conservancy's Rippl app or EarthEcho's Water Planet Challenge. We can make sure the ocean continues to provide inspiration, wonder and solutions for generations, however, it all comes down to personal and collective will. Ask yourself this question: When you look upon the ocean 10 years from now, do you want to see a sad reminder of what could have been; or do you want to be filled with awe and inspired by a sense of endless possibilities? The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of Philippe Cousteau .","It's time to recapture our sense of wonder about the oceans, says Philippe Cousteau .

"Washington (CNN) -- Testimony given by the director of the embattled U.S. Secret Service on Tuesday appears to conflict with the news that broke hours after Julia Pierson's testimony -- that a private security contractor with a gun shared an elevator with President Obama, in violation of protocol, during his trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta two weeks ago. In her testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Pierson said she is responsible for briefing the President whenever there is a serious breach of his or his family's security. When asked how many times she had to take such action in 2014, she said it was only after the September 19 incident in which a man armed with a knife jumped the White House fence and made it into the mansion's East Room. Not long after the hearing adjourned, the Washington Examiner and then the Washington Post reported the incident in Atlanta on September 16. An agency official confirmed the incident to CNN in which a security contractor operating an elevator at the CDC was carrying a gun in the presence of Obama and his Secret Service detail. The contractor was taking pictures of the President and otherwise behaving in an unprofessional manner, the official said. When the security worker was confronted about his behavior, it was revealed that he was armed. Asked about the apparent inconsistency in Pierson's testimony, a spokesman for the Secret Service, Ed Donovan, told CNN ""we aren't going to discuss private conversations the director may have with the President."" Can the Secret Service actually change? According to Secret Service protocols, it is up to the agency to decide who is allowed to possess firearms in the presence of the President. The agency official said that the elevator operator was determined not to be a threat to Obama after he was interviewed by officers. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment from CNN. ""I believe the President's security was unnecessarily compromised,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told CNN. ""A convict with a gun in an elevator with the President put his life in danger. The Director should have informed the President, yet she testified she did not. Did she lie to Congress or fail to inform the President?"" Chaffetz at the hearing specifically asked Pierson ""what percentage of the time do you inform the President that his personal security has in any way, shape or form been breached?"" ""Percentage of the time?"" Pierson responded. ""A hundred percent of the time we would advise the President."" ""You would advise the President,"" Chaffetz specified. ""Yes,"" she said. ""In calendar year 2014 how many times has that happened?"" asked Chaffetz. ""I have not briefed him ... except for one occasion for the September 19 incident,"" she said, referring to the White House intruder who was able to breach White House security and get into the East Room of the White House. Chaffetz clarified that the only time she had only briefed the President about his or his family's personal security in 2014 was the one time. ""That is correct,"" she said. The elevator incident happened three days before the fence-jumping intrusion at the White House. CNN's Jim Acosta contributed to this report.","""I believe the President's security was unnecessarily compromised,"" Chaffetz says .

"(CNN) -- With Americans Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller back in the United States, the big question now is why did North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agree to their release? Is it a sign Pyongyang wants better relations with Washington? Is it sending a message to its closest ally, China? Or is it a bid to shift the focus off its human rights record amid talk Kim could be charged with crimes against humanity? ""I think right now there is a charm offensive,"" Gordon Chang, the author of ""Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes On the World,"" told CNN. Something in Pyongyang, Chang believes, sparked the offensive. But just what stemmed the change is highly debated. This much is clear: North Korea's release of Bae and Miller on Saturday came amid a rare, last-minute trip by a top American official -- Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, to Pyongyang, a senior State Department official told CNN on condition of anonymity. Clapper, who was tapped by President Barack Obama as an envoy, made the trip after North Korea urged the United States to send a Cabinet-level official, the official said. Clapper is not a member of Obama's cabinet. He is the government's spy chief. The official said there were no discussions about North Korea's nuclear program, and other U.S. officials told CNN there was no ""quid pro quo"" for the men's release. ""I do believe it's a positive sign,"" Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who tried to win Bae's release during a 2013 visit to North Korea, told CNN. With North Korea ""catching a lot of grief"" on its human rights record in the United Nations, Richardson said it appears Pyongyang is sending a message that ""we're ready to talk."" The secretive nation has been slapped with crippling U.N. sanctions. It has previously used negotiations surrounding its burgeoning nuclear program to get needed aid, such as food. 'There may be a number of reasons' But Joel Wit, a former State Department official who negotiated with North Korea, believes the release of Bae and Miller had very little to do with ""a desperate cry for help."" ""There may be a number of reasons why North Korea may have released the two Americans now,"" he said. It could be as simple as North Korea made its point. ""These people were put in jail for a certain amount of time, and now they can be released,"" he said. Or it could be that Kim is ""communicating to China ... that Pyongyang is trying to be reasonable, and the United States is not."" Wit said it also could have something to do with North Korea's effort to tamp down the possible fallout from a scathing U.N. Commission of Inquiry report cataloging North Korea's abuses that the investigators said amounted to crimes against humanity. ""I think there is no doubt in the minds of anyone who follows North Korea closely that Kim Jong Un is in charge. There's no doubt about that,"" Wit said. Kim, who took over as the absolute leader following the 2011 death of his father Kim Jong Il, personally ordered Bae and Miller released. Early hopes that the younger Kim would be open to warming relations with the West were quickly dashed after he took a series of provocative steps, including threatening a preemptive nuclear strikes. He has since come to be viewed as more unpredictable, more dangerous and harder to read than this father. Christopher Hill, who served as the head of the U.S. delegation in failed talks aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear ambitions, also doubted the release of the two men was a good-faith gesture. ""He has not shown any sign of living up to what his father agreed to, which is to do away with his nuclear program,"" he told CNN. Asked whether there was any substance behind the so-called ""charm offensive,"" Hill said, ""It's really kind of early to tell."" Human rights allegations . The release of Bae and Miller comes a month after North Korean officials appeared to go on the offensive, taking questions at the United Nations, arranging human rights talks with the European Union and taking a high-level trip to South Korea. It was an abrupt about-face for North Korea, which only a year earlier had conducted an underground nuclear test and threatened attacks against South Korea and the United States. In return, the United Nations slapped additional sanctions against North Korea, further isolating the secretive nation. The sanctions have cut off North Korea's ability to trade with most of the world. The so-called charm offensive appears to have coincided with the release of a U.N. commission report that accused North Korean leaders of a pattern of human rights abuses that ""does not have any parallel in the contemporary world."" The commission said it would refer its findings to the International Criminal Court, also known as the ICC, for possible prosecution. It also sent a letter to Kim warning he could face prosecutions for crimes against humanity, and warned of other options, including the possibility of being tried before an ad hoc tribunal by the United Nations. In order to charge Kim or other North Korean leaders, the move would have to be approved by the U.N. Security Council. If the matter escalates to that level, China -- a permanent member of the council -- has indicated it likely will veto it. China and North Korea have been close allies, since China backed the North in the Korean War in the 1950s. The United States supported the South in the conflict, fighting side by side with its troops. The two Koreas are still officially in a state of war, though an armistice signed in 1953 ended the bloodshed.

"(CNN) -- Jury selection began Monday in the murder trial of former Chicago-area police officer Drew Peterson, who is accused of killing his third wife and is the leading suspect in the disappearance of his fourth. Opening statements are scheduled for next week. Peterson's attorney Joel Brodsky told CNN's sister network In Session that he expects the trial to last about a month. Peterson, 58, is charged in the 2004 death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio. He also remains under investigation in the October 2007 disappearance of fourth wife, Stacy Peterson. In April, an Illinois appellate court ruled that prosecutors may use potentially incriminating statements made by Savio and Peterson's still-missing wife against him -- a key development in the case. Ex-cop attends hearing in wife's death . The ruling overturned an earlier judge's decision that forbid prosecutors from using eight statements made by Savio before her death and by Stacy Peterson before her disappearance. When Savio was found dead in a bathtub in 2004, it was ruled accidental. She had been divorced from Peterson for about five months when she died, though a court was still deciding how their marital assets would be divided. Savio was to receive part of Peterson's pension and other support. Just eight days after his divorce from Savio, Peterson married Stacy Cales, then 19. After Stacy Peterson went missing in October 2007, her husband became the focus of a police investigation. Authorities exhumed Savio's body and conducted a second autopsy, this time ruling her death a homicide. Since Savio is dead and Stacy Peterson is missing, the defense has argued that using their alleged statements to family and friends violates Peterson's Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. Among the statements the appeal court allowed is one in which Stacy told her pastor that she saw Drew Peterson return home the morning Savio died, dressed in black and carrying a bag of women's clothes that were not hers. Drew Peterson goes on trial in 3rd wife's death; 4th wife still missing . In general, hearsay statements made to third parties cannot be introduced at trial unless a defendant can cross-examine the person who made them. There are some exceptions if prosecutors can prove the statement is reliable. But a new Illinois law, which some call ""Drew's Law,"" goes beyond those exceptions. The law, passed in 2008 while investigators were looking for Stacy Peterson, allows courts to consider statements from ""unavailable witnesses,"" provided prosecutors can prove the witness was killed to prevent his or her testimony. The intrigue surrounding the case has added to Drew Peterson's mystique and prompted the Lifetime movie ""Drew Peterson: Untouchable,"" which set a ratings record of 5.8 million viewers for the channel when it premiered in January.

"(CNN) -- In many parts of the world, being born a girl means being born without rights. A girl born today in Egypt has a 91% chance of undergoing female genital mutilation (FGM) by the time she reaches puberty, according to the World Health Organization. She has a 22% chance of being married by the time she is 18 and a 99% chance of experiencing sexual violence at some point in her lifetime. In Afghanistan, according to the sharia law in that country, a girl is legally allowed to marry when she is 15, while 12% of girls aged 15-19 bear children, according to a 2010 survey used by Human Rights Watch. If she is lucky, she might be the one in five girls today in Afghanistan who learns to read. Even if she receives an education, she may become one of the 87% of women to experience violence, according to Oxfam. Female genital mutilation (FGM), child marriage, child pregnancy, sexual violence, and the exclusion of girls from education are consequences of the violence and oppression institutionalized and maintained by the so-called ""honor system."" For girls raised in these societies, their sexual purity and obedience to a set of pre-determined norms is viewed as the yard stick of a family's honor and status. As girls, they are inherently valued as less than boys. Men can beat, torture, maim, rape and exclude them from all decisions with impunity. Too often, girls' bodies are the property of their male guardians. Their brains and creativity are valueless. And their choices are irrelevant. These are not aberrant instances; they are realities widely-accepted and legally mandated in honor-based societies in the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Shariah law in many countries institutionalizes girls' oppression, legalizing and enforcing the honor system. But even in societies without shariah law, such as the United States, girls and women are at risk of gender-based violence such as FGM. Up to 200,000 girls in America are at risk of being torn and mutilated as a result of FGM -- even though it has been illegal since 1996. Young girls are sometimes taken abroad by their families on ""cutting vacations"" to have the procedure performed. In July, President Obama said: ""...there's no excuse...Female genital mutilation -- I'm sorry, I don't consider that a tradition worth hanging on to. I think that's a tradition that is barbaric and should be eliminated. Violence towards women -- I don't care for that tradition. I'm not interested in it. It needs to be eliminated."" The President is correct. Culture is no excuse for abuse of girls and women. He is also correct when he said: ""One of the single-best measures of whether a country succeeds or not is how it treats its women."" The U.S. government recently initiated an inquiry into FGM in the United States. This is a positive step, although the U.S. woefully lags behind its European counterparts. UK Prime Minister David Cameron has exhibited leadership in trying to end FGM in his country and globally by hosting his recent Girl Summit and by engaging the UK Border Patrol to prevent parents from taking girls overseas to be cut. This is an effective practice that will hopefully inspire similar action in the United States. Fortunately, the global community understands the need to end the abuse of women and especially girls. In 2011 the United Nations declared October 11 the International Day of the Girl Child. This year's theme is ""Empowering Adolescent Girls: Ending the Cycle of Violence."" The lead agency for the day, UNICEF, released a concept note to address its policy recommendations for eradicating violence against adolescent girls. These include: . These are all commendable ideas to empower and educate girls, and they are essential. However, these recommendations fail to acknowledge or address the root cause of violence affecting hundreds of millions of girls: the ""honor system"". Technical training will not prevent a girl's father from selling her to a much older man. Additional data collection will not stop a girl's clitoris from being removed. Advocacy without action will fall on deaf ears. UNICEF and other U.N. agencies, in addition to governments around the world, must condemn the legal frameworks which institutionalize and perpetuate violence against girls. All of us have a role in informing policy and getting the right issues on the table. We can tweet at U.N. agencies and officials creating the global policy and write to our local representatives urging them to guarantee that women's rights is always part of the conversation with countries that oppress women. At the community level, we can encourage existing women's and girls' agencies to invest in resources and outlets for victims of honor-based violence. If at least 200,000 girls are at risk of FGM in the U.S., chances are that one of them lives in your community. Are the teachers, social workers, and doctors in your area prepared to help her? Statistics are ever-changing. It is impossible to know definitively whether a girl born this very moment will have the same chances as her older sister, her aunt, or her mom. But something is certain. If we do not courageously speak out and demand change, we will know what that girl's future will look like -- and it is very bleak.","Many girls around the world have no protection from being raped and maimed by men .
Some governments are taking action, but more needs doing, says Kweskin .

"Albuquerque, New Mexico (CNN) -- Patricia Repar conducts weekly rounds at the University of New Mexico Hospital not in a white coat and stethoscope, but in street clothes and carrying, quite often, an armful of CDs, Native American flutes and even instruments she has designed herself. Although Repar is a musician, not a medical doctor, her role as director of the hospital's Arts-in-Medicine program is perhaps no less integral to the care and healing of some of the institution's sickest patients. ""It is often the case that seriously ill patients are suffering from things that cannot be relieved with pills or procedures,"" says Repar, who founded the program in 2002. ""We listen for what those things are and try to address them."" A troupe of actors, dancers, writers, musicians, visual artists and movement specialists rove the different sections of the hospital. Painters might be found on any given day in the cancer center, dancers in the psychiatric unit and harpists providing musical sustenance on any given floor. Their mission is to facilitate ""creative encounters"" that can help patients and their families discover new meaning in life and death, or ""just for fun,"" as Repar puts it. Sometimes, this can be as simple as playing music at a patient's bedside to help them calm down or sleep. Recently, a volunteer in Repar's program encountered a woman in her 50s paralyzed from the neck down. The woman used to be a painter but could no longer handle a brush or paints and had been labeled a ""problem"" patient. The artist offered to act as the patient's hands, drawing a picture as directed by the bedridden woman. ""The painting was lovely but, better yet, it really brought the patient alive and really turned around the situation,"" recalls Repar. ""The next day she was a new person. It was an amazing experience."" Helping patients navigate the health care system . Musicians and other artists are now a fixture at many medical facilities around the country. Almost half of U.S. health care institutions surveyed by the Global Alliance for Arts & Health in 2009 (the most recent data available) had arts programs of some sort, including permanent displays of arts, performances in public spaces and bedside activities. While the arts may not cure patients, ""research has proven that it does assist the patient in terms of getting well,"" says Sharon Woodworth, an architect and Global Alliance board member. ""It either allows them to relax (so that) their treatment is more acceptable or it helps the caregiver in terms of better reaching the patient."" The University of New Mexico program may well be one of the oldest university-based arts programs, says Repar. And it has grown by leaps and bounds since its inception. In its inaugural nine-month cycle in 2002 -- the program is active only during the school year -- it served more than 2,000 people including patients, family members and staff with a budget of $10,000. At that point, the program consisted primarily of concerts and ""roving rejuvenators"" -- artists and massage professionals tending to hospital staff and patients. In 2012-2013, the budget was about $140,000, Repar says, and the program served about 34,000 people. By this time, the program included more arts services for patients, family members and hospital staffers. It also has several community outreach projects, an international collaboration with South Africa and research and educational arms. Growth has been consistent, but not always smooth. Three years ago, in remodeling a room, the hospital inadvertently removed the closets that had been used by Arts-in-Medicine to store musical instruments and other supplies. The hospital eventually gave Arts-in-Medicine another room, but then took that away. Now, Repar and her staff have their own small office, furnished with a massage table, an old upright piano and assorted other musical instruments, some of which Repar designed herself, as well as tidy sections of colored pencils and CDs. How hope can help you heal . Repar came to the field after becoming severely ill while visiting Ecuador. ""I was afraid and lonely and frustrated,"" she says. ""I distinctly remember feeling like I was tapped on the shoulder by death."" She decided the only way she could deal with it was to create collages, images, short and simple ""sound"" pieces, poetry and narratives. ""The daily art-making kept my life full of meaning,"" says Repar, who has a doctorate in music composition. ""And I found myself calm and pain-free until I could get further medical care in my home country of Canada."" She turned the art she made while recovering into a performance piece. That led to palliative-care courses, then a collaboration with a hospice in New Mexico and eventually a teaching gig -- Repar is associate professor of music at UNM -- and the arts program. Dr. Chris Camarata, a UNM assistant professor of family and community medicine, says he has seen wide-ranging benefits in patients who have participated in the arts program. ""I've seen definite symptom improvement,"" says Camarata, including reductions in pain and even reductions in the amount of pain medicine required, nausea and anxiety in people who are exposed to the arts while in the hospital. He has also seen depressed patients respond to the arts, even when they don't respond to other people. Music can calm dying people who are agitated or in delirium and help with obtaining peace and quiet at the end of life, Camarata says. For Max Chavez, 60, art has become a way to deal with depression and simply pass the time while enduring four-hour chemotherapy sessions. A new kind of children's hospital . Chavez has colon cancer, which has spread to his liver and possibly his chest and spinal cord as well. In the past year, he has undergone four surgeries to remove part of his large intestine and one-third of his liver. He has spent countless hours in the chemo suite with little to do but read, doze or gaze out the window. ""There's nothing you can do but sit there really,"" says Chavez, a general contractor in Sandia Park, New Mexico. When artist Catherine Veblen showed up with a cart full of art supplies one day, he thought, ""What the heck, I'll try my hand at this."" Chavez, his wife and sister-in-law sat around a table and painted and drew. Chavez now has about 15 art cards he made that he sends as greeting-card notes to various people -- including the head of the UNM Cancer Center, who displays it on her desk. ""The art helped me pass the time away and gave me something to do creatively that I wasn't doing because I was pretty depressed,"" Chavez says. ""I didn't have the energy to do much physical work (but) ... I was able to sit at a table and be creative and not exhaust myself."" The experience also spurred him to take on creative endeavors in his own life. ""The neatest thing about it was I went home and started doing artwork,"" says Chavez, who is back at work although still undergoing chemotherapy. ""It was a great, great inspiration."" He's not the only one inspired. Musician Dave Hoover recalls standing by an elevator with a cancer patient who had just listened to him play the harp. ""I almost forgot why we were here,"" she told him. Talking to someone with a chronic illness .","The Arts-in-Medicine program serves patients at a New Mexico hospital .

"(CNN) -- A passenger aboard the British-based cruise ship MS Marco Polo was killed after the ship was hit by a ""freak wave during adverse sea conditions"" as it made its way into the English Channel, according to a statement released Friday by the ship's owner, Cruise & Maritime Voyages. ""One elderly passenger has died and a further passenger has been airlifted for further shore-side medical assistance,"" it said. The cruise line did not release the identity nor nationality of the dead passenger. The ship was en route from the Azores to its home port in Tilbury, England, and it was carrying 735 passengers and 349 crew members, the cruise line said. The passengers are primarily British, it said. The cruise line did not reveal the condition of the injured passenger or say whether there were other injuries. A man whose mother and father are aboard the Marco Polo said he first learned of the incident when his parents texted him. They said a large wave hit the side of the ship between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. local time as they were dining in one of the ship's restaurants, said the man, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity citing concern over a possible backlash against his parents. When the wave hit, the windows in the restaurant burst and people were injured, the man said. Passengers were asked to the go their rooms, and the man said his parents did that as the ship rocked side to side. The ship never lost power, he said.

"(CNN) -- There had been no confirmed deaths in the United States related to swine flu as of Tuesday afternoon. But another virus had killed thousands of people since January and is expected to keep killing hundreds of people every week for the rest of the year. People are nervous about swine flu, but the regular flu kills 36,000 people a year in the United States. That one? The regular flu. An outbreak of swine flu that is suspected in more than 150 deaths in Mexico and has sickened dozens of people in the United States and elsewhere has grabbed the attention of a nervous public and of medical officials worried the strain will continue to mutate and spread. Experts are nervous that, as a new strain, the swine flu will be harder to stop because there aren't any vaccines to fight it. But even if there are swine-flu deaths outside Mexico -- and medical experts say there very well may be -- the virus would have a long way to go to match the roughly 36,000 deaths that seasonal influenza causes in the United States each year. ""That happens on an annual basis,"" Dr. Brian Currie said Tuesday. Currie is vice president and medical director at Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, New York. Since January, more than 13,000 people have died of complications from seasonal flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's weekly report on the causes of death in the nation. No fewer than 800 flu-related deaths were reported in any week between January 1 and April 18, the most recent week for which figures were available. The report looks at deaths in the 122 largest cities in the United States. Worldwide, the annual death toll from the flu is estimated to be between 250,000 and 500,000. About 9 out of 10 of those deaths are among people older than 65, Currie said. Most times, they already have health problems that the flu makes worse, he said. ""Regular influenza can be taxing,"" he said. ""It causes their underlying disease to decompensate and then they don't have the reserves to get through it. ""While it may not be the direct cause listed on the death certificate, it certainly contributed."" One of the reasons medical experts are nervous about the swine flu outbreak is that many of the people who have died in Mexico have been young and otherwise healthy. The strains found in the United States have so far been weaker. But even the regular flu is sometimes fatal for younger victims. ""It's not unheard of. It happens, either directly from influenza or they get a bacterial superinfection"" like staph, said Currie. While researchers haven't developed a vaccine to fight the new swine flu, it can be treated with antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza, the same drugs used on the regular flu. Many times, seasonal flu itself is tough to prevent because it has mutated to a form different than it was when the vaccine was made. Seeking to put the swine flu outbreak in perspective Tuesday, Los Angeles County public health officer Dr. Jonathan Fielding echoed other public officials calling it ""cause for concern, but not for alarm."" ""Given the size of L.A. County, given the traffic between here and Mexico, it would be very surprising if we didn't have any cases,"" Fielding said. He said the county, where the CDC had confirmed 10 cases of swine flu by Tuesday, sees more than 1,000 flu-related deaths every year. ""So it would also not be surprising if there were deaths with swine flu -- even if it had the pattern of seasonal flu,"" he said. ""Thus far, the pattern we see in the United States is very similar to that of seasonal flu -- relatively mild to moderate cases."" CNN's Samira Simone and KC Wildmoon contributed to this report.","Swine flu getting focus, but so far it's not deadly in United States .

"Washington (CNN) -- It was a long summer for President Barack Obama, who for months has defended his decision not to send U.S. troops to fight ISIS on the ground in the Middle East. But lawmakers contend that in the wake of a rapidly-spreading Ebola crisis and the upcoming midterm elections, the President's commitment towards fighting the extremist terrorist organization has fallen short. Comparing the spread of Ebola to the ISIS threat against the United States, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said Sunday that he doesn't believe that the President is handling each issue with equal rigor. ""The stronger Ebola gets in Africa, the more it spreads and the more entrenched it is -- the more endangered we are,"" Graham told Candy Crowley on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""The same (goes) for radical Islam in the Mideast. It seems to be that the President is all in when it comes to Ebola. I want to compliment him for sending troops to help get ahead of this in Africa, but we have a series of half-measures with (ISIS)."" His Republican colleague, Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, went a step further Sunday, saying that the President's foreign policy ""is being trapped by his campaign rhetoric."" Ebola becomes an election issue . ""I'm very fearful as we look at the current military strategy that it is surrounding the November elections and that he won't have the resolve to follow through with what needs to be done in a sustained effort to destroy ISIS, and we're about to repeat the same thing with Afghanistan,"" Ayotte said on Fox News Sunday. Asked if she thought the President would pull back some of his commitment towards the issue after the midterm elections, Ayotte responded, ""I'm very concerned about that ... and his resolve in this regard."" Both Ayotte and Graham have said that they do not believe that ISIS can be defeated without U.S. ground forces in Iraq, a move the President has vehemently opposed. But should Obama decide to increase the U.S. military presence in the Middle East to fight ISIS, he'll have to first face Congress and a Republican-controlled House, whose leader says the President needs to outline a more robust foreign policy strategy for Congress to take up the debate. ""The President has to lay out a strategy. I don't see that for the American public,"" Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""What is the goal? What is our foreign doctrine? What is our foreign policy?"" ""I see the threat before us. Looking at the chambers, we will see what people debate,"" he said. ""I can pick and choose what goes forward but would never second-guess the House."" Biden explains how Ebola is like ISIS . Even if a bill were to pass allowing the President to expand America's military presence in the Middle East, the looming threat of defense cuts under sequestration could limit the administration's response. That issue, lawmakers say, is a concern in which they are willing to reach across the aisle and compromise for. ""I want to sit down with Sens. (John) McCain, Jack Reed, (and) Diane Feinstein to replace these cuts,"" Graham told Crowley. ""Republicans have to give on revenue, close deductions in the tax code and put the money back in the sequestration and entitlement reform."" Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island shared that sentiment. ""Sequestration has to be either eliminated or somehow postponed and that goes not just for some of the issues like the Department of Defense. That goes for every agency of the federal government,"" Reed said on ""State of the Union."" ""And people like Lindsey Graham who want to work on the issue, I want to work with him on it. Those types of issues are going to have to be dealt with no matter who is in charge."" Despite the looming threat of sequestration, the public anxiety over of the Ebola crisis and the recent Secret Service failures that have come to light this past month, the administration says the American people shouldn't be worried about its ability to handle the ISIS threat and other matters of national security. ""I do understand that people have had a growing skepticism of institutions for a long time, including government,"" senior Obama advisor Dan Pfeiffer said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""But people should know that ... where a problem arises, we deal with it. We deal with it quickly, we deal with it forcefully to make sure it doesn't happen.""","Sen. Lindsey Graham says Obama ""is all in when it comes to Ebola,"" but not ISIS .

"(CNN) -- There have always been great moments in global events that changed world history. On July 4, 1776, Americans signed the Declaration of Independence and began their march toward democracy. On September 2, 1945, World War II mercifully ended when Japan surrendered after more than 50 million had died during that brutal conflict. And on November 9, 1989, the people in occupied East Germany took control of their own destinies when they literally hammered the Berlin Wall to the ground. It is hard to recapture the breathtaking drama of that period in Europe 25 years ago. Throughout 1989, there were clear signs that the Soviet Empire was crumbling. In Poland, Hungary and elsewhere, popular movements successfully challenged Soviet-backed regimes that had long since lost their legitimacy. But nowhere was the drama greater than in East and West Germany, the epicenter of the Cold War. Since August 13, 1961, when East Germany erected the terrible barrier that cut off West Berlin from East Berlin and East Germany, the wall became a dreaded symbol of isolation and despair. Family members were separated, and for the next quarter of a century, more than 100 Germans were killed trying to escape past the wall. Then, on October 9, 1989, more than 70,000 East Germans gathered outside the Nikolai Church in Leipzig carrying candles of peace and chanting, ""Wir sind das Volk!"" We are the people! Demonstrations were followed by more and larger protests, in Leipzig and around East Germany. Precisely one month later, the Berlin Wall fell. The United States had long supported German unification and we backed the efforts of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other German leaders to move toward rapid political and economic integration of East Germany into the Federal Republic. Of course, there were international complications: Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had signaled that the Soviet Union would not act militarily to stop unification. So it was still important to find ways for Gorbachev to fend off criticism from Kremlin hardliners. Moreover, Britain's Margaret Thatcher and France's Francois Mitterrand were initially skeptical about a unified Germany. To deal with these concerns, we developed the ""two plus four talks."" Under this formula, the two German governments negotiated the internal terms of reunification while the four occupying powers -- the United States, the Soviet Union, France and Great Britain -- addressed its international aspects. The successful talks resulted in the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany signed by all six parties in Moscow on September 12, 1990. That treaty ended the limitations on German sovereignty that had existed since World War II. The leadership role President George H.W. Bush played in German unification was pivotal, but Kohl and Gorbachev also played truly decisive roles. The former brought immense passion and creativity to the process. The latter, despite bitter opposition by reactionaries at home, remained committed to a resolution without bloodshed. Above all, though, unification was achieved by the German people, in Leipzig and elsewhere, who never lost faith in freedom and never lost hope for the future. Looking back, one of President Bush's outstanding traits has been his humility, and particularly his insistence after the Iron Curtain fell that Americans not gloat about our victory in the decades-long Cold War against the Soviet empire. In 1989, after all, the President still had further business to do with Soviet leaders, even as their country was rapidly imploding. Included on his checklist were nuclear arms reductions, which were later accomplished and have played a critical role in maintaining world peace. Time and time again, President Bush demanded that we not dance on the ruins of the Berlin Wall. He simply wouldn't hear of it. But 25 years later, on November 9, 2014, we should all enjoy a celebratory jig to commemorate what happened on that fateful day. That magical moment is a reminder to all people everywhere in the world -- those alive then, today and well into the future.

"Little Rock, Arkansas (CNN) -- Former President Bill Clinton suggested on Saturday that the fall in Hispanic turnout for Democrats in 2014 was partly due to President Barack Obama's decision to not issue an executive order on immigration. At a Politico event with Mike Allen in Little Rock, Clinton and his former aides reminisced about the past but with a clear eye on how their decisions in the 1990s could be implemented in the future. Clinton also handicapped the disastrous midterms for Democrats. ""There was a collapse of the youth vote, the African-American vote held fairly steady,"" Clinton said. ""We had a little bit of a loss of the Hispanic vote, perhaps because the President didn't issue the immigration order. But it was a tough call for him because had he done so, a lot of others would have lost by even more. It was a difficult call."" Latinos made up 10% of the electorate in 2012, according to CNN's exit polls. In 2014, that number was 8%. In September, Obama decided to postpone issuing an executive action on immigration until after November's elections because it would be ""more sustainable"" then. Clinton said the biggest problem for Democrats -- who lost their majority in the Senate and fell deeper into the minority in the House -- was that ""the people who were against us felt more strongly than the people for us."" The former president also suggested that a national advertising campaign -- that Democrats ""didn't have"" -- on an economic message and other issues could have ""made all the difference in a couple of close races."" Clinton's recollections came during a celebration around the 10th anniversary of the Clinton Presidential Center. A steady stream of former campaign and administration aides were in town for a weekend that has seemed part reunion, part party and part pep rally for the future. For the Clinton confidants in Little Rock this weekend, that future, while not expressly addressed, is Hillary Clinton's all-but-certain presidential run in 2016. Hillary Clinton spoke earlier in the day at an event for the Clinton Foundation's ""No Ceilings"" initiative. Unlike other events during the week that looked back at the Clinton administration, the former first lady's event was forward looking on how to increase women's participation in the workforce. At the Politico event, Bill Clinton looked to the future while talking about the past by arguing that his administration ""showed the importance of policy."" ""We can do this again,"" he said to a room full of Hillary Clinton fans.","Bill Clinton suggests that Barack Obama's decision to hold off on immigration reform hurt Democrats with Hispanic voters .

"(CNN) -- Just as Americans are staring down flu season, Hong Kong grabbed headlines this week with news confirming that a chicken was infected with the H5N1 virus and that many more suspected of harboring the dangerous disease were slaughtered. In the recent movie ""Contagion"", Hollywood's version of a pandemic, the government successfully executes a response plan. But our real-life encounter with a pandemic, the H1N1 flu, raises serious questions of whether the American public is prepared for such a crisis. It should have been good news that the H1N1 epidemic we confronted in 2009-10 was less deadly than feared, but instead, it was used as political leverage. Conservatives, in particular, claimed the vaccination recommendations were overhyped, more ""big government"" meddling in citizens' lives. What's worse, many media outlets highlighted the critical narrative while minimizing strong evidence that the government handled the threat quite well under the difficult circumstances. This occurred as opinion polls revealed the public's growing lack of confidence in government officials and institutions, which are now at record levels . Is it any wonder, then, that, despite extensive planning and billions of dollars, the public will be unprepared for the next time? The reason lies in our deep distrust of government and thus, our unwillingness to believe the experts' claim that vaccination is the single best method for preventing the spread of disease. To be sure, Americans have both historical and contemporary reasons for suspecting that government officials may not be diligent in protecting the public's health over powerful interests. The history of epidemics is replete with boneheaded government actions that trampled the rights of marginal populations in the interests of protecting the so-called larger public. Nearly every major American epidemic has targeted the poor or an ethnic minority group as objects of blame in efforts to prevent the spread of disease. As late as the 2003 SARS outbreak, New Yorkers shunned the city's Chinatown amid rumors that undocumented immigrants had brought the disease to America. By some estimates, business fell by 70% although not a single case from that neighborhood was ever diagnosed. In this media environment it is harder than ever for us to know who to trust and how to separate fact from fiction. During the H1N1 pandemic, radio personalities such as Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh implied that choosing not to take the vaccine was a litmus test of ideological commitment to opposing the Obama administration. Some opponents of the administration's proposed health care reform legislation delighted in the vaccine production delays and questioned its safety and effectiveness, saying it was proof of the government's incompetence to ""run health care."" Two senators commanded a news cycle by demanding the secretary of Health and Human Services explain the shortage, joining the chorus of those accusing the government of wildly overestimating the production schedule and making false promises . Within two weeks of such grandstanding, there was a surplus of vaccine, although well over half of those questioned in polls said they believed there was not enough vaccine for all who wanted it. Too many are willing to accept, if not engage in, factual distortions to create their own comfortable reality. Public opinion polls around the time of the H1N1 danger revealed nearly a 20-point difference between Democrats' and Republicans' intention to seek the vaccine. Republicans not only were less inclined to take it, they were also more inclined to doubt the disease was as serious as health officials claimed. Our continued willingness to follow politicians who are leading us astray is to our own detriment. Admittedly, it takes considerably more effort to critically evaluate the accuracy of information we receive, especially if inconvenient, than to simply accept what we want to hear, but we have no other choice. Acting responsibly will literally be a matter of life and death. In the end, fewer than 20% of Americans took the vaccine, with over half of the population indicating they didn't believe the government message that the vaccine was safe and effective. Ironically, Hollywood has now legitimated the public's skepticism by including a scene in ""Contagion"" in which a reporter asks the fictional CDC official how he knows the epidemic threat is not ""another false alarm"" like the H1N1. Take it from me: H1N1 was not a false alarm, nor were the government recommendations to address it hyperbolic. In the uncertainty of a crisis environment, government officials provided effective leadership. The distortions of politicians, ideologues and certain media outlets did us a disservice. Fewer Americans than expected died or required hospitalization, but next time, we might not be so lucky. Ultimately, it's up to us to see through the politicizing and headline grabbing and protect ourselves. As Pogo observed, ""We have met the enemy and he is us.""

"(Fast Company)  -- Following increased pressure from the FTC, Google and Mozilla are introducing opt-out features to their Chrome and Firefox browsers. Soon, users will have the option to stop personalized advertisements, ads tailored to your Web-surfing habits that have sparked significant privacy concerns. Will these new features allay privacy fears and FTC meddling? Last month, the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection proposed a ""Do Not Track"" tool to curb concerns over personalized or behavioral advertising. The FTC hoped the tool might be similar to the ""Do Not Call"" registry -- the system that deterred telemarketers from causing so many headaches -- but offered very few technical details. Such a comprehensive opt-out registry, as some have pointed out, would be difficult to implement. Unlike ""Do Not Call,"" which relies on unique telephone numbers, ""Do Not Track"" could not depend on similar identifiers, as IP addresses are constantly changing. Google and Mozilla have addressed some technical issues with their features, but are far from offering streamlined opt-out systems. On Chrome, the feature is available as an extension called Keep My Opt-Outs, which enables users to save opt-out preferences even once a browser's cookies have been cleared. Before, when one's history was erased, so too was any opt-out preference. With this extension, Google has made these particular cookies permanent; however, users will still be required to opt-out of ad tracking themselves. Firefox's ""Do Not Track"" feature has a gaping loophole. For the tool to work, ad tracking companies essentially must opt-in to the system, and agree not to monitor web-surfing habits of users who have chosen to opt-out. Thus far, according to the Wall Street Journal, no companies have openly agreed to participate in Firefox's ""Do Not Track"" program, though Mozilla is urging advertisers to ""honor people's choices."" ""Mozilla recognizes the chicken and egg problem,"" Alexander Folower, Mozilla's global privacy head, wrote in a blog post. And so won't many users, who are likely to realize both Google's and Mozilla's ""Do Not Track"" features are not comprehensive. It's also important to note that these extensions are opt-out systems, rather than opt-in. Many consumer advocacy groups and government officials have pushed for the latter feature, which would mean behavioral advertising would no longer come default -- users would have to opt-in in order to see personalized ads. If Mozilla, Google, and other browser companies don't address these concerns soon, they could face legislative mandates, as FTC chair Jon Leibowitz has threatened. And such legislation could be as annoying to them as, well, telemarketers and personalized ads are to us. Copyright © 2010 FastCompany.com, a unit of Mansueto Ventures, LLC.

"(CNN)  -- In the country that ranks second in the harvest of coca, the plant whose leaves are used in the production of cocaine, the idea to get Peruvian farmers to plant alternative crops is not new. Traditionally, the idea has been met with criticism -- why would growers switch to crops that bring less income, economists ask -- but may have finally found a foothold in Peru, thanks to the success of a growing industry in cacao beans, used in the production of chocolate. In the upper Peruvian Amazon forest, in the north-central region of San Martin, cacao has become a hit, eclipsing the allure of growing coca. ""Some 99 percent of the producers in Tocache were dedicated to producing coca,"" said Mario Cavero, of the Tocache Agroindustrial Cooperative. Now, he said, it is cacao that has become ""a very strong engine of growth."" The transformation was the result of years of programs, backed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which appear to have paid off. In October, the Tocache Agroindustrial Cooperative, located in the San Martin region, won a prestigious award from the Salon du Chocolat in Paris for the most aromatic cacao beans, beating competitors from Ecuador, Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago. The distinction is bringing even more attention to the region locally and abroad, as first reported by Time Magazine this month. The shift from coca to cacao is significant in a country that has supplied so much coca to international drug trafficking organizations that turn the leaves into cocaine to be smuggled north to the United States and elsewhere. ""The province of Tocache is one that suffered many years of terrorism and narcotrafficking,"" Cavero said. ""I think now our country is heading on a good route."" There is much room to grow, he added. Already between 2006 and 2009, exports of cacao beans increased from 16 metric tons to 250 metric tons. Cavero estimated that export figure will reach 600 metric tons this year, and even more in the years ahead. Peruvian exports of cacao products were almost $67 million in 2009, according to an association of cacao growers, most of it going to European chocolate makers. Part of the reason for the switch, Cavero said, are the high prices that cacao sells for. He wouldn't speculate whether cacao beans pay more than coca production, but he noted other benefits, such as security and access to legal markets, that helped make cacao a winner in the area. But is the success enough to turn Peru away from coca for good? ""Undoubtedly there have been some successes, but it's not going to resolve the coca problem,"" said economist Hugo Cabieses. Cacao has become the star alternative crop in the San Martin region, but in other areas where coca grows, like the Apurimac River Valley in south-central Peru, cacao has not caught on in the same way. There are high-quality beans that can be cultivated in many parts of Peru, Cabieses said, but in most cases it is difficult to transport to markets in Peru and abroad. In the same way that some feel secure by trading coca production for cacao, growers in areas with a stronger presence of traffickers can be intimidated into continuing with coca production, he said. Unlike the north, in southern Peru, coca fields greatly outnumber cacao fields. ""Unfortunately, coca continues to be No. 1 in the valley of the Apurimac River,"" Cabieses said. Meanwhile, production in Peru in the subsequent steps in drug production, such as processing the coca leaves into cocaine paste and then into cocaine hydrochloride, have increased in recent years, he said. Peru also remains the second largest producer of coca in the world, behind Colombia. The bottom line, according to Dan Cilo, who sells Peruvian-made chocolate in the Washington area, is ""that whole region of San Martin and Tarapoto used to grow a lot of coca. Now it grows a lot of cacao."" Cilo, owner of Peruvian Chocolates, buys his product from a factory that makes the chocolate in San Martin, the same place where the raw materials are. The success of the San Martin region shows that if governments spent more time nourishing alternative development instead of crop eradication, change can come, according to supporters of such programs. ""This can be replicated in other parts of the country,"" Cilo said. And, supporters hope, to other major coca-producing countries.","Cacao beans can be a better crop than coca plants for farmers, some say .

"(CNN) -- I'm struck by one big question as I watch the Republican presidential candidates battle each other while President Obama tries to win re-election: Why does anyone want to be president? It's like auditioning to be bandleader on the Titanic. And yes, I said bandleader and not captain because the captain of a ship has more of an impact on the direction of a voyage than President Obama, or any president who might follow him, can have in our hyperpolarized political climate. With the onslaught of problems he faces today, I wouldn't be shocked if in the coming weeks President Obama appeared on national TV and declared: ""I have an important announcement: I was actually born in Kenya. Joe Biden you take over, I'm outta here!"" But he won't quit. Instead, he will raise close to a billion dollars for his re-election campaign. Meanwhile, the Republican presidential candidates will viciously fight each other, like gladiators in the Roman Coliseum -- which, frankly, the past two Republican debates resembled. The audience jeered and booed, with some at times even applauding the death penalty and cheering the notion of allowing a person with no health insurance to die. All that was missing was a thumbs up or down from the crowd indicating if a candidate should be executed. (This, too, would undoubtedly have been met with cheers.) Think about it: When you run for president , you are running for the worst job in America. If elected (or re-elected) you must deal with a cascade of domestic and international headaches. But to me the greatest challenge facing our president (or a new president) is not the economy or the European debt crisis. It's not the growing influence of China, the Arab Spring or even the issue of Palestinian statehood. Nope, the biggest challenge the president faces is us. Yes, ""We the People."" Simply put, we are horrible. We have become unreasonably demanding. We want everything now and we won't compromise. ""We the People"" have become Veruca Salt from ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" making demands in our high-pitched voices: ""I want a goose that lays golden eggs and I want it now!!"" ""I want the deficit reduced now, Daddy!"" ""I want low taxes but the same government services!"" And if you won't give us what we want, when we want it, we will turn our back on you. For example, President Obama had almost a 60% approval rating after the killing of Osama Bin Laden in May, but just four months later, a recent poll shows, his approval rating is at 39%. The left wants him to be more liberal, the right wants him to be more conservative and the middle just wants more. The Republican presidential candidates have seen this, too, with Rick Perry being at first welcomed into the race like the ""prodigal son."" Now, only a few weeks later, he looks more like a doomed NASA satellite about to fall from the sky. What has caused us to become so demanding? The 24-hour news cycle and social media that allows instant real-time commentary have contributed. But an even bigger factor is our conditioning to reality show competitions on TV. On any number of TV shows each week, we watch, judge and vote on whether a person performs to our liking. One week we sing their praises, but the next week, if they misstep, they are dead to us. We now treat our candidates this way. It's a presidential version of ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" where we want to fire -- or at least dissect and scrutinize -- the president and presidential candidates for every small gaffe. I have seen better treatment for contestants on Gordon Ramsay's ""Hell's Kitchen"" than for our candidates for president. If this keeps up, what type of candidates for president will we attract in the future? Will it be the smartest and the most qualified or those who, like reality show stars, can weather the cruel glare of an unending spotlight and the fickleness of our affection? Even reality-show veteran Donald Trump's skin was too thin to run for president, which is shocking since his skin looks like leather. And, yes, that snarky comment is just the kind of thing I'm talking about, but I'm no better than the rest of us. Since this seems to be what we crave, why not commit 100% to it and create political reality shows to choose our future presidents? What about shows like: ""The Amazing Electoral Race,"" ""Dancing with the Candidates,"" or ""So You Think You Can Govern?"" We can vote people off until we are left with the man or woman who has survived by telling us exactly what we want to hear each and every week. But if we don't take a break from this ""American Presidential Idol"" mentality, we will have no one to blame but ourselves when the 2016 presidential campaign pits Mike ""The Situation"" against the Kardashians. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: With politics so hyperpolarized, who would want to be president?

"(CNN) -- Somebody really, really wants to get an audience with Apple CEO Tim Cook. An anonymous bidder paid $610,000 to chat over coffee with Apple's chief executive, according to online-auction site Charity Buzz, which began accepting bids about three weeks ago. Tuesday's winning bid came only several minutes before the auction closed at 4 pm ET. The auction site had valued the meeting with Cook at $50,000. Proceeds from the auction will go to The RFK Center for Justice and Human Rights, an international nonprofit founded as a memorial to Robert F. Kennedy by his family and friends. The auction saw 86 bids, many of them from companies that do business (or want to do business) with Apple. The coffee chat will happen at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters. The winner may bring along one guest. Travel and lodging for the visit, which will last between 30 minutes and an hour, are not covered. Visitors will be required to sign a nondisclosure agreement and are subject to a security screening. Also, they can't liveblog or tweet during their meeting. The move fits in with the more open public persona Cook has adopted since replacing late Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs. In the past 18 months Cook has met with members of Congress on Capitol Hill and toured factories in China that make Apple products. By some measures, a $600,000 coffee meeting with the chief of the world's leading tech company might be a bargain.

"(CNN) -- The disappearance last autumn of three young Michigan brothers has turned into a murder investigation, authorities said Tuesday. Residents in the small city of Morenci, Michigan, have searched two months for Tanner Skelton, 5, Alexander William Skelton, 7, and Andrew Skelton, 9, who were last seen at their father's home on Thanksgiving. The father, John Skelton, who is charged with parental kidnapping, is the primary suspect, Police Chief Larry Weeks said at a news conference. Weeks said that while he could not disclose much information, he wanted to put an end to ""false hope"" the boys would be found alive. He asked farmers and others to be on the lookout for their remains. ""When the time is appropriate, charges will be requested,"" Weeks said. John Skelton told investigators he gave the boys to a group called United Foster Outreach and Underground Sanctuaries, Weeks said. No such group was found to exist, the chief said. ""It's just one example of misinformation that we have received from him that indicates the direction this investigation is continuing in,"" the chief said. Skelton was arrested in December upon his release from a mental health facility where he was treated after a suicide attempt. Skelton also said he left the three boys with a woman, whom he identified as Joann Taylor, the morning before he tried to take his own life -- in part to ensure that they did not witness his suicide attempt, police said. Skelton said Taylor was supposed to return the boys to their mother at their home in Morenci, a southern Michigan town of about 2,400 people about 40 miles west-northwest of Toledo, Ohio, on November 26, Weeks said. But the boys never arrived. Earlier, authorities determined that Skelton had no ""established relationship"" with the person he named as Taylor, and they aren't certain she even exists. Kathye Herrera told reporters Tuesday the boys' mother, Tanya, and the family are experiencing ""utter despair to a peaceful feeling knowing that the boys are in a better place."" ""Andrew, Alexander and Tanner will be on their hearts and minds forever,"" said Herrera, thanking the community for aiding the family and helping in searches in Michigan and Ohio. ""They will be missed not only by the family, but by friends, classmates and the entire community."" According to CNN Detroit affiliate WDIV, John Skelton appeared Friday for a brief court hearing as part of his divorce case. The judge asked him whether he was prepared to give the children to their mother, and he answered, ""I can't,"" WDIV said. Skelton family friend Bill Foster told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell he understood why Weeks made Tuesday's announcement. ""Too many people started believing they [the boys] could be with someone or an organization,"" he said. The last time someone other than a family member saw the boys was at 5 p.m. on November 25, according to Weeks. Police say Tanner is 3 feet, 6 inches tall, has strawberry-blond hair and blue eyes and weighs about 40 pounds. Alexander is 3 feet, 9 inches tall, has brown hair and eyes, weighs about 45 pounds and has scars on his hairline and chin. The oldest brother, Andrew, is 4 feet, 1 inch tall, has brown hair and eyes and weighs roughly 57 pounds.","Three Michigan boys have been missing since November .

"(CNN) -- Russians go to the polls on Sunday March 4 to elect a new president. Current Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is attempting to regain the post he held between 1999 and 2008. He has been a dominant force in Russian politics for more than a decade but his popularity has suffered recent setbacks. So who is challenging him and what will the poll mean for Russia? CNN examines some of the key questions. Russia recently had elections. What is this one about? Russia's top job -- that of president -- is being contested this time. It follows parliamentary elections in December in which Putin's ruling United Russia Party received 49.5% of the vote -- down from 64% four years ago. It kept United Russia in power in the lower house, called the Duma, with 238 of the 450 seats but also triggered major protests over allegations of vote rigging and ballot stuffing. Putin dismissed calls for a review, but the outgoing president Dmitry Medvedev announced political reforms in the wake of large demonstrations. Putin is now seeking to regain the presidency which he has held twice before. Russian law prevents presidents serving more that two consecutive terms so he was obliged to stand down in 2008. How is the president elected? There are effectively two systems in place. Parties represented in parliament can nominate their own candidate -- others need to collect two million signatures of support that are then scrutinized by Russia's Central Electoral Commission. Four of the five standing this year are party nominees, while independent candidate, the billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, garnered enough support to run for the post. To gain the presidency, the candidate must secure 50% of the poll plus one vote. If this fails to happen there is a run-off between the two highest polling candidates in a second round of voting to be held within two weeks. So who is standing? There are five candidates: . Vladimir Putin of the United Russia Party. A primary focus of his campaign has been modernizing Russia's military, saying it's the only way to improve Russian standing in the world. Putin's political career . Gennady Zyuganov, nominated by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. This is his fourth attempt to gain election to the top office. Sergey Mironov is standing for Just Russia. He is left leaning and lost the 2004 race for the presidency. Vladimir Zhirinovsky for the Liberal Democratic Party. A right-winger, this is his fifth attempt to be elected president. Mikhail Prokhorov, an independent. The billionaire produced a manifesto of democratic and economic reforms but CNN's Moscow correspondent Phil Black says he's struggling to shake off his reputation for being too close to the current regime. Metals mogul hoping to shine . Another candidate, Grigory Yavlinsky, of the non-parliamentary party Yabloko, was barred from standing by the Central Electoral Commission for invalid signatures -- a move his website suggests was politically motivated. Who is likely win? Despite a drop in popularity, CNN correspondent Phil Black says Putin is very likely to regain the presidency. A recent poll for the Russian Public Opinion Research Center showed him to be on 55% with none of the other candidates polling more than 10%. Putin's drawing power . Black says although Putin is clear favourite to win, he can expect continued public dissent. ""He'll be leader of a country that has changed dramatically in the last three months,"" he said. How long does the president serve? The president is entitled to stay in office for six years. It used to be four years but the constitution was changed in 2008 to allow the extension to six. Russian presidents cannot serve more than two consecutive terms. Vladimir Putin can run again despite two previous presidencies as he is currently in the post of prime minister. How powerful is the president? In Russia, the president is more powerful than the prime minister. Professor Richard Sakwa, an Associate Fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Program at London-based think-tank Chatham House, explains that the president is responsible for foreign policy and security and has the power to dismiss the prime minister. He says there are two key camps in this election -- those that see Putin as a safe pair of hands providing stability and security, and those that feel he has overstayed his welcome and want a ""move away from heavy-handed political management."" The current president, Dmitry Medvedev, has already been nominated for prime minister by Putin if he wins -- once again swapping roles. In December, Daniel Treisman, a professor of political science at the University of California in the U.S., told CNN: ""Switching places, although hardly an inspired move, is the simplest way to stir the waters without fear of rocking the boat. Yet the reality is that Putin's return to the Kremlin will not, in itself, change much. For the last four years, he has made all key decisions, with Medvedev's advice, and he will continue to do so."" Professor Sakwa adds: ""If Medvedev is prime minister I think he will continue to push through political reform. The prime minister is quite an important figure."" Are there any fears about electoral fraud? The parliamentary elections in December were marred by allegations of ballot stuffing with the Organization for Security and Cooperation saying in a preliminary report that some political parties had been prevented from running and the vote was ""slanted in favor of the ruling party."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the U.S. also had serious concerns. Thousands of Russians turned out to protest. In response, Medvedev announced political reforms to address discontent. He proposed that Russia returned to direct election of regional governors; simplify the registration of political parties and presidential candidates; establish new editorially independent public TV channel; and called for lifting of many of the political restrictions imposed in the past several years by Putin. Phil Black reports that Putin wants to install 300,000 cameras in 90,000 polling stations at an estimated cost of $1 billion to prevent fraud. But Alexei Navalny, a leading opposition figure, told Black that they don't have any confidence in what Putin says and believe the move to install cameras is a ""gimmick."" What about wider corruption? Dmitry Medvedev has worked to stamp out corruption in Russia, signing a 2008 decree to counter its effects. Despite this, Russia remains ranked 143rd out of 182 countries on a corruption perception index published by Transparency International. Pavel Ivlev, founder and chairman of the Committee for Russian Economic Freedom, told CNN in January that ""the average citizen has experienced the brutality of corruption carried out day-to-day by an omnipresent and thuggish bureaucracy. ""Each year an estimated 15-20% of Russia's economic output goes towards some sort of bribe - whether paying off tax authorities, the police or other local officials -- thus creating a significant drag on small businesses and innovation."" Although Sakwa believes many in Russia never have to pay a bribe he added that there are others, particularly business people, who do have to. ""The tolerance level has come to a point where they've had enough of this."" If Medvedev returns as prime minister after the presidential election his reforms will be further tested.","Current Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is trying to win the post he held between 1999 and 2008 .

"London (CNN) -- Few shows can claim such an audience. As the dramatic spectacle of the Olympic Games opening ceremony in London unfolded Friday night, organizers estimated a billion people around the world would be glued to their television sets to see it, either live or delayed by a few hours. Tens of thousands more were lucky enough to have a seat inside the Olympic Stadium, the centerpiece of Olympic Park in east London. Dubbed ""Isles of Wonder,"" it was quite a show -- fast-paced and diverse, with everything from people dancing in period costumes to a pseudo house party. It featured tributes to the British countryside and the Industrial Revolution (complete with smokestacks emerging from the ground), showcased the ""Chariots of Fire"" soundtrack as well as pop music staples from the Beatles to Amy Winehouse, and even comedy bits featuring Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson), actor Daniel Craig and even Queen Elizabeth II herself. The queen was among the more than 80 heads of state attending the event, which sets the scene for the Games to come. London cheers Olympic torch as opening day nears . The organizers of the London Games were well aware they had a tough act to follow after the Beijing extravaganza four years ago, which featured thousands of drummers, acrobats, martial artists and dancers performing under a light display at the soaring ""Bird's Nest"" Stadium. Some details of the Â£27 million show were released in advance, but many more remained closely guarded secrets.

Those who opted not to play along incurred the social-media wrath of many who did want to ""save the surprise."" The show, masterminded by artistic director Danny Boyle, best known for the Oscar-winning film ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" drew part of its inspiration from Shakespeare's ""The Tempest."" It began at 9 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) with the tolling of the largest harmonically tuned bell in Europe, cast by the nearby Whitechapel Foundry, which also produced Big Ben and the Liberty Bell. The sound echoed the peals of bells that rang out across the country for three minutes Friday morning, Big Ben among them, to set the nation's Olympic spirit racing. The show's opening scene -- dubbed ""Green and Pleasant,"" after a line from a poem by William Blake -- then unfurled, presenting an idyllic view of the British countryside. The elaborate set comprised rolling hills, fields and rivers, complete with picnicking families, sport being played on a village green and real farmyard animals: ducks, geese, 12 horses, three cows and 70 sheep, plus three sheepdogs to keep them in line. Chasing the gold-dust of 'Brand Olympics' The flower of each of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom also were represented -- the rose of England, the Scottish thistle, Welsh daffodil and flax from Northern Ireland. Boyle also lined up fake clouds to shade his pastoral scene. Other set pieces paid tribute to Britain's National Health Service, children's literature (showcasing characters from the evil Lord Voldemort of Harry Pottery infamy to magical nanny Mary Poppins) and popular music. It was all a mammoth production involving not just Boyle and his technical crew, but also a cast of 10,000 adult volunteers and 900 local schoolchildren. Then there was a heavy-duty flying system, nearly 13,000 props and an array of technological wizardry. After these performances, the athletes -- who, after all, are the real stars of the Olympic show -- entered the stadium, team by team in alphabetical order, apart from Greece, which enters first in recognition of its status as the birthplace of the Games, and Great Britain, entering last, the position reserved for the host nation. Why gritty East End is London's gold standard . After speeches from Olympic officials -- including Sebastian Coe, head of the London organizing committee and himself a former gold medalist -- the queen officially declared the Games open and the Olympic flag was later hoisted above the stadium, where it will fly throughout the competition. The grand finale saw five-time gold medalist rower Steve Redgrave carry the torch into the stadium, where he handed the flame off to seven promising young athletes. They then lit parts of the large cauldron, triggering a chain of events that culminated in small flames converging in the sky above the stadium.

"(CNN) -- Forty years ago, a group of young people led by a charismatic, 5-foot-2-inch ex-con named Charles Manson set out on a murderous spree in Los Angeles, California. They planned to spark an apocalyptic race war that Manson called ""Helter Skelter,"" after a song by the Beatles. Charles Manson's mug shot shows a beard gone gray. The swastika on his forehead is still visible. Over two nights in August 1969, the killers took the lives of seven people, inflicting 169 stab wounds and seven .22-caliber gunshot wounds. They used the blood of their victims to scrawl anti-establishment messages on the walls: ""Pig,"" ""Death to Pigs,"" ""Rise"" and a misspelled ""Healter Skelter."" ""The murders were probably the most bizarre and far-out in the recorded annals of American time,"" said Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Manson and members of his ""Family"" and later wrote the best-selling book ""Helter Skelter."" ""People are fascinated by the strange and the bizarre."" Crimes linger in our memories when they are especially horrific or when they represent the era in which they occur. The Manson murders did both. And they grew to symbolize the dark side of the California dream, as well as the political, social and cultural turbulence of the 1960s.  Listen to the music of the Manson murders » . Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School who follows high-profile cases, described Manson as the worst of the worst, evil incarnate. ""If you're going to be evil, you have to be off-the-charts evil, and Charlie Manson was off-the-charts evil,"" said Levenson. The Manson murders abruptly ended the ""decade of love,"" and Southern California lost its sun-kissed, self-indulgent innocence. The crimes added a lasting mantra for the times, Los Angeles Times columnist Patt Morrison said: ""Live freaky, die freaky."" ""It was the dark side of paradise,"" Morrison said. ""People could shake their fingers and say, 'This is where your high-living, rich, hippie, movie-star lifestyle gets you. This is where the drug culture gets you.' It's the boomerang effect, the wages of sin."" Actress Sharon Tate, 26, famed hairstylist Jay Sebring, 35, coffee fortune heiress Abigail Folger, 25, and two others died shortly after midnight August 9, 1969, at a rambling house overlooking Benedict Canyon. Tate was married to director Roman Polanski and eight months pregnant. She begged in vain for her life, saying she wanted to live to have her baby, according to Bugliosi. The next night, grocer Leno LaBianca, 44, and his wife, Rosemary, 38, were butchered in their home in the wealthy Los Feliz neighborhood. Rosemary LaBianca was stabbed 41 times. A fork jutted from Leno LaBianca's abdomen, where one of his killers had carved the word ""war."" When arrests came and the identities of the killers became known, the case grew even more frightening, Bugliosi said. The suspects were hippies who lived in a commune at an old movie set in the San Fernando Valley called Spahn Ranch, where they dropped acid, engaged in orgies and went on nighttime break-ins, missions they called ""creepy crawls."" ""They could have been the kid next door,"" Bugliosi said. ""Tex Watson was a straight-A student, a track star. Patricia Krenwinkel wanted to be a nun and sang in a church choir. Leslie Van Houten was homecoming princess at Monrovia High School."" They were in thrall of Manson, who told them he was Jesus Christ -- and the devil, rolled into one. Manson's ""Helter Skelter"" race war and revolution never came. He and Susan Atkins, Watson, Krenwinkel and Van Houten are serving life terms for their roles in the murders. Atkins, who is said to be dying of brain cancer, has a parole hearing next month. With their brew of violence, music and anti-establishment youth counterculture, the murders and ensuing trials established Manson as a perverse cultural icon that endures to this day. Along the way, the mastermind transcended his victims, and the Tate-LaBianca murders became known as the Manson murders. Charlie Manson's image can still be found on posters and T-shirts. In 1998, the animated television series ""South Park"" featured Manson in a Christmas special. There have been books, a play, an opera and television movies about the case. There are even iPhone applications of Manson's famous quotes.  Learn more about the music that was influenced by Manson » . ""Manson is like a Rorschach test,"" said Robert Thompson, a Syracuse University professor who teaches popular culture. ""How you interpret his place in popular culture depends on your own place in the culture."" Before the Manson murders, no one thought hippies were capable of violence. The Manson Family was ""looking and living like typical hippies,"" Bugliosi said, ""but they were mass murderers. That was their religion, their credo. They wanted to kill as many people as they could. That shocked the nation, and that hurt the countercultural movement."" Manson's musical roots partially explain his staying power. A folk singer, he wanted to break into the music industry and recorded some songs with one of the Beach Boys. Manson's own music has continued to influence other performers, like Guns N' Roses and Marilyn Manson. Manson believed that the Beatles were speaking to him through the lyrics of the White Album, which was released in late 1968. The apocalyptic message, as Manson interpreted it: Blacks would ""rise up"" and overthrow the white establishment in a race war. Manson and his Family would be spared by hiding out in a ""bottomless pit"" near Death Valley until he could emerge to assume leadership of the post-revolutionary order. Manson's crimes continue to evoke a strong reaction long after public obsession over other high-profile cases has faded. He was the bogeyman under the bed, the personification of evil, the freaky one-man horror show. For years, when prison officials still allowed it, he gave television interviews, never failing to shock. The interviews kept memories of him fresh long after he was locked up. ""You got a pistol on you?"" he asked Tom Snyder during a televised 1981 prison interview. ""Well, I just thought you might not like what I have done and want to do something about it."" Seven years later, he was far more volatile during a televised conversation with Geraldo Rivera: ""I'm gonna kill you, as many as I can. I'm gonna pile you up to the sky, I figure about 50 million ..."" What sets Manson apart from other infamous killers is that he never killed anyone himself, Levenson said. Instead, he convinced others, mostly women, to kill for him. His powers of persuasion didn't stop there. During his 1970 trial, Manson carved an X in his forehead, saying, ""I have Xed myself from your world."" His codefendants and sidewalk followers soon did the same. When Manson was convicted, he and his codefendants shaved their heads. ""It's mind warp. That was really scary,"" Levenson said. ""It wasn't just that people were spouting beliefs for him; they were cutting crosses in their heads. ""I think Manson will haunt us forever.""","Seven died in two-day Manson murder spree 40 years ago .

"(CNN) -- The remarkable display of civil disobedience by hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong citizens reflects a profound sense of desperation that has grown as China has closed off all political options and made it increasingly clear that it intends to call the shots. In theory, the ""Basic Law"" spelling out the terms of the territory's reversion to Chinese rule was to allow a ""high degree of autonomy,"" leaving in place Hong Kong's rule of law, civil service and free-wheeling capitalist system. This was based on then Chinese President Deng Xiaoping's clever formulation of ""One Country, Two Systems"" and negotiated painstakingly during the 1990s with the Thatcher administration of the United Kingdom. Since 1997, when Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule, many of China's efforts at exerting political influence have been subtle, and, with a few exceptions such as implicitly limiting the press, Hong Kong has more or less been allowed to continue its open economy, legal system and freedom of assembly. But over time, it has appeared more one country and less two systems. The Basic Law envisioned gradual progression to universal suffrage by 2017. But as that date got closer, Beijing sought to restrict that outcome. In June, China released its first-ever White Paper on Hong Kong, which stresses how Hong Kong's autonomy has limits. The ""power to run local affairs"" remains -- but only ""as authorized by the central leadership."" In other words, your liberty stops when we say so. The White Paper offered other reinterpretations of the 1997 Accord, including the notion that the territory's judicial decisions must ""take into account the needs of China,"" a vague requirement but crystal clear to Hong Kong. On the core issue of democracy, one that has repeatedly brought Hong Kongers from all walks of life into the streets, the White Paper speaks of introducing universal suffrage as promised in the Basic Law by 2017 -- but the requirements to run in the elections are that a candidate must be ""patriotic"" and ""love China."" Of course, it is Beijing who determines which candidates meet that criteria. Beijing defined what those requirements mean in a decision on September 4, namely that all candidates must be chosen by a ""nominating committee"" comprised of pro-Beijing local elites. The disappointment in Hong Kong was palpable, sparking the ""Umbrella Revolution"" that reached record numbers of tens of thousands in the streets on China's October 1 National Day holiday. Beijing has been largely silent, preventing the Chinese media from even reporting the protests, with state-run media charging that the clearly homegrown protests are fueled by ""foreign forces."" Protestors are calling on Chief Executive C.Y. Leung to resign. Typically, Beijing prefers local leaders to deal with such crises. The ruling Communist Party sees its legitimacy as fragile and President Xi Jinping cannot afford to show any weakness. But Leung appears to have few options. There may be a potential middle ground of compromise, but many doubt that Leung has the flexibility to negotiate with Hong Kong protestors. But Beijing's Hong Kong problem has implications well beyond the former British colony. As China's former paramount leader, Deng had introduced the ""One Country, Two Systems"" formula with Taiwan in mind. China's Communist Party-led state has always made the Taiwanese uneasy. Their skepticism has only deepened as they've watched Beijing's unelected rulers circumscribe Hong Kong's freedoms. China's economic dynamism has also been a locomotive of growth for Hong Kong, Taiwan and much of the region. China-Taiwan ""cross-strait economic integration"" has seen more than $100 billion in Taiwan investment in the mainland by some estimates, and China is now Taiwan's largest trade partner. But there is little support in Taiwan for political dialogue aimed at a Hong Kong-like reunification scheme. China has appeared comfortable with ruling KMT President Ma Ying-jeou, who has accelerated cross-strait interaction more than any of his predecessors. Still, popular protests in Taipei against new cross-straits trade accords, and more recently in sympathy with Hong Kong, suggest that the next Taiwan presidential elections in 2016 could result in a Taipei with which Beijing is uncomfortable. In his first statement on Taiwan upon taking office, Xi said, ""The issue of political disagreements that exist between the two sides must reach a final resolution, step by step. These issues cannot be passed on from generation to generation."" Beyond Taiwan, China's assertiveness toward territorial claims in the East and South China Sea has made its neighbors fearful of the implications of China's re-emergence. Enlightened self-interest would suggest that China find an accommodation within the framework of the Basic Law. But given the stakes perceived by Beijing, China is less concerned about its global image and far more concerned with maintaining control. This leaves Leung between a rock and a hard place. One way forward, without having Beijing's fingerprints on it, could be to allow Leung to seek a middle ground and negotiate with key opposition figures to end the protests in exchange for broadening the committee that vets candidates and/or offering a means for candidates to run if they attain a petition with a substantive number of signatures. Absent such creativity, it is difficult to see how Hong Kong's political problem can be resolved in a way that would convince those in the streets to fold up their umbrellas. In the event of an outcome that leaves the status quo in place in Hong Kong, the U.S. administration needs to address its own China dilemma with a China policy that seems to be tilting less toward cooperation and more towards competition: how to impose costs on Beijing for unacceptable behavior.","Hong Kong protests sign of desperation, says ex-U.S. ambassador to China Jon Huntsman .
Chinese President Xi Jinping cannot afford to show any weakness, Huntsman says .
U.S. must work out how to impose costs on Beijing for unacceptable behavior, he writes ."
"(CNN) -- In the 1960s and 1970s, Big Tobacco was widely viewed as the model for effective special-interest lobbying. Bans on public smoking have been on the rise in recent years. ""My own view is that in many ways, the tobacco industry invented the kind of special-interest lobbying that has become so characteristic of the late 20th- and earlier 21st-century American politics,"" said Allan Brandt, dean of Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. The industry was known for its giant spending on political campaigns and effective lobbyists. The industry's representatives often had experience in politics or close ties to major power players. ""Today obviously, that lobby is much less powerful and successful than it was a generation ago,"" said Brandt, author of ""The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product That Defined America."" The industry is now facing regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, and although one major cigarette company supported the FDA bill, the legislation is widely viewed as a sign that tobacco is finding fewer friends in Washington. The lobby began to lose power as the industry lost credibility, Brandt said. In the 1950s and 1960s, the lobby centered attention on the notion that the science of tobacco was uncertain, and it called into question each medical and scientific finding that came out as it continued to spend ""boatloads"" of money in Congress, Brandt noted. In 1964, the surgeon general report officially recognized the health risks of tobacco. At the time, about 42 percent of adults in the United States smoked, compared with about 20 percent today. At the time, cigarettes were hardly viewed as the enemy. Tobacco companies sponsored game shows and cartoons, and cigarette ads featured endorsements from doctors, dentists and celebrities. Congress in 1965 required that all cigarette packages carry warning labels, ones that were made under the surgeon general's name five years later. By 1970, television and radio advertisements were banned. By 1988, smoking was banned on U.S. flights two hours or less, and 10 years later, all U.S. carrier flights became smoke-free. Wayne McLaren, who appeared in the ""Marlboro Man"" ads, developed lung cancer in the late 1980s and started an anti-smoking campaign. Shortly before cancer took his life in 1992, a television ad ran showing images of him as a handsome cowboy next to those of him in his hospital bed. Five years later, under pressure from the public and Congress, the R.J. Reynolds Co. voluntarily ended its use of ""Joe the Camel"" as the mascot for Camel cigarettes. A 1991 study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association found that 6-year-olds could just as easily recognize Joe the Camel as Mickey Mouse. As skepticism from the public crept up, Big Tobacco's power began to erode. The industry was hit with a big blow in 1998 when it agreed to a $206 billion master settlement with 46 states, the largest settlement in U.S. history. The case settled Medicaid lawsuits against the top tobacco companies. The 40-year-old Tobacco Institute and the Committee for Tobacco Research -- the public relations organ and the funder of tobacco research -- were disbanded as a part of the settlement. And just last month, in what Brandt considers ""one of the most significant racketeering and fraud litigations"" the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler's ruling in a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, case, which found the tobacco industry guilty of engaging in a decades-long conspiracy to defraud the American public about the health risks of tobacco. ""Given the character of Kessler's findings -- and now the fact that her findings have been upheld by the appeals court -- this is really in a way a road map to tobacco regulation,"" Brandt said. Stanton Glantz, a longtime anti-tobacco advocate and director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, said the RICO ruling is what the public health community should use in its fight against the tobacco industry. ""I think it really can undermine the power of the industry politically by going to politicians and saying, 'These guys are crooks. They are crooks according to the D.C. Court of Appeals. Not just me,' "" Glantz said. More than 30 states -- including North Carolina, the nation's top tobacco producer -- have passed full or partial bans on smoking in public places. In North Carolina, such a move would have been unheard of just several years ago, with Sen. Jesse Helms in power. Republican Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi --- a former tobacco lobbyist -- also recently approved a 277 percent hike on his state's cigarette tax. Under the FDA regulation, warning labels on packages soon will show pictures of the harmful effects of tobacco. As public opinion increasingly sides with the public health community, the tobacco lobby has been losing some of its support in the nation's capital. The Bush administration was widely considered a friend of the tobacco industry. Some of Bush's top staffers had backgrounds in tobacco, including senior adviser Karl Rove, who once worked with Philip Morris. Tobacco has since lost some of its strongest advocates, including Helms, who died last summer. Now, Democrats hold both chambers of Congress and the White House. President Obama was a co-sponsor of the FDA regulation legislation when he was in the Senate, and his administration has demonstrated a commitment to tobacco control. Many of today's top leaders in Congress are also strong tobacco-control advocates. But despite the restrictions, there are more than 40 million smokers in the United States -- and that's still a viable industry. Despite what it sees as setbacks from the FDA bill, Reynolds plans to ""energetically continue to compete"" for adult smokers, said Maura Payne, vice president of communications for Reynolds American Inc. And Philip Morris, which had a role in crafting the FDA legislation, said there could be more competition for new manufacturers as a market emerges for ""reduced-harm products."" Tobacco companies have shown their influence is still felt, even this year. Even though 79 senators voted for final passage of the FDA legislation, it took two months and three cloture votes to get it off the Senate floor. (Freshman Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina was the only Democrat to vote against it.) As the tobacco industry tries to adapt to the changing market, Brandt predicts it will look to where it can operate in an unregulated environment. ""The future of this industry has been to move its product offshore and to aggressively attempt to open new markets to cigarettes and to really play out what it did in the United States in the 20th century, now in countries in the developing world,"" he said, noting that the biggest profits for tobacco as a global industry are ""not likely to be in more affluent and highly regulated economies."" Although the industry has been fractured in the United States, Brandt said he anticipates a long road ahead for the public health community. ""I think these are victories in what have been called the tobacco wars, but the tobacco wars are anything but over,"" he said.","Tobacco industry once known for big spending on campaigns, effective lobbyists .

"Madrid (CNN) -- A court in Spain on Friday dropped the most serious charge facing Princess Cristina, a sister of King Felipe VI, raising the possibility that she could avoid a court trial in a financial scandal. The Provincial Court in Palma de Mallorca threw out a charge of money laundering but allowed two charges of tax fraud to stand, according to the court order. It was not immediately clear whether the alleged crimes, as charged, would mean a trial for the princess. A magistrate who has been investigating the financial scandal for several years will have to determine whether to do so, an official at the court told CNN. A court trial of a member of the Spanish royal family would be unprecedented. The case centers on the nonprofit Noos foundation, which received millions of dollars in government contracts to stage sports and tourism events. The magistrate, Judge Jose Castro, investigated whether part of that money may have been diverted for private use by the princess and her husband, Inaki de Urdangarin, who is also charged. Through their legal teams, both have denied any wrongdoing. Before the three-judge panel issued its 160-page ruling Friday -- in response to appeals by various parties to the case -- the court official, by custom not identified, had told CNN that the princess almost certainly would have faced trial if the court had upheld all three charges against her. But since only the two counts of alleged tax fraud still stand, Castro must decide whether to apply a legal precedent in Spain that if the state prosecutor wasn't pressing charges for tax fraud, which is the situation for the princess, then no trial would be held. A small union called Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, is alone in pressing the tax fraud charges against her, as a kind of private prosecution, permitted in Spain. The Supreme Court previously ruled in a separate case that a private charge alone was not strong enough to force a tax fraud trial. Urdangarin and some 15 other defendants who are charged in the case are expected to face trial, the court official said. The judge has not set a trial date yet.","NEW: Magistrate in the case must decide whether Princess Cristina will stand trial .

"(CNN) -- With a tiny land mass relative to its 8.2 million residents, the state of Israel is running out of room to bury its dead. So it's joining an unconventional trend led by other densely packed areas: Instead of burying the dead below the earth, it's building up. ""The idea is to create cemeteries for multilevel burial,"" says Tuvia Sagiv, who with his partner, Uri Ponger, is the architect behind 30 ""high burial buildings"" planned for the already crowded Yarkon Cemetery outside Tel Aviv. ""There is simply no room."" Each structure will be 70 feet tall. Together they will make up what is known as a ""vertical cemetery."" Leading rabbis and the Israeli Ministry of Religious Services have even declared the stacked cemeteries kosher, due namely to clever architecture by Sagiv and team. ""We're not allowed to cremate the bodies or move the bones, so this is best way."" Jewish burial law is based in part on a passage in Genesis ""For dust you are -- and to dust you shall return."" Jewish law stipulates that the dead be buried separately on a layer of dust and earth. So while there is no restriction on multilevel burial, each body must rest on soil. To comply with religious law, the towers of the vertical cemetery structures have pipes filled with dirt inside their columns so that each layer is still technically connected to the ground. ""A body is laid on earth, connected to the earth,"" Sagiv says, ""so the building is full of earth, every body we put inside will be on the earth."" Despite acceptance by rabbis and the chevra kadisha, Israel's ultra-Orthodox burial societies, there are some Orthodox Jews who aren't happy with the structures. ""They prefer to do things in a traditional way,"" Sagiv says, but he maintains that his structures are in some ways the most traditional. ""It is the same as thousands of years ago when the Jewish people created burials in caves one on top of the other."" Today's vertical structures have terraced sides with plants and landscaping, openings on the sides for fresh air, but coverage for visitors in inclement weather or the beating sun. It provides ""a closeness and a connection between the living and the dead,"" Sagiv says. In Israel, the idea of vertical cemeteries is growing. At the end of November, the chevra kadisha will hold a conference with the Ministry of Religious Services to discuss Jewish burial rules, and specifically vertical cemeteries such as the structures in Yarkon Cemetery. ""The buildings will provide a solution to the problem of lack of burial space for more than the next two decades,"" says Itay Goor, a spokesman for Chevra Kadisha of Greater Tel Aviv. While the idea may seem odd to some, vertical cemeteries already exist where populations are dense and land is scarce, such as in China, Japan, Egypt and even New Orleans, where high waters make burial difficult. Brazil is home to the world's tallest vertical cemetery, the Memorial Necropole Ecumenica in Santos, which is 32 stories high. In India, the Moksha Tower building will be split up into different sections for the four main religions practiced in Mumbai, and will be even taller.","Israel is joining other population-dense areas to build ""vertical cemeteries""

"(CNN) -- Amid calls for greater openness at the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary, the nine justices released their financial disclosure reports Friday. They did so in the old-fashioned way, in person and on paper. The figures reaffirm the members of the nation's highest court, despite earning a government salary, are generally well off financially, and like to travel. The figures show at least six and as many as eight of the nine justices have investments worth at least $1 million. The reports only require they list only a range from investment income. Only Justice Sonia Sotomayor listed any financial liabilities, mostly minor credit card debt. But a lucrative rental property she owns, her former New York City residence, brought in between $1 million and $5 million last year, although she still carries a hefty mortgage. Sotomayor also previously earned more than $2 million from her popular 2013 memoir, ""My Beloved World."" But in the latest financial disclosure, the Bronx native reported no ""non-investment income"" last year, indicating royalties from book sales did not exceed her previous advances. Justices Antonin Scalia, $77,000, and Stephen Breyer, about $11,000, separately listed royalty income from earlier books they wrote. And Scalia earned the annual prize for most traveled justice: 28 separate trips for speeches, lectures, and teaching, including visits to New Orleans, Montana, Italy, and Peru. Three out-of-town appearances were before the conservative Federalist Society, which liberal groups have criticized Scalia in the past as an ideological conflict-of-interest. But other members of the court have also participated in events sponsored by ideological non-profits. All nine members of the court reported at least one trip overseas, including to Austria, the Czech Republic, Scandinavia, and Poland. And seven members claimed teaching income from universities, including lectures, which generally earned them about $3,000-$20,000 for one or more days of extracurricular work. Most such stints occur during the court's three-month recess, scheduled this year to begin in late June, when the last of the session's rulings will be issued. Even retired justices have to report their income. Sandra Day O'Connor, who stepped down from the bench in 2006, maintains a remarkable schedule. The 84-year-old said she has 21 positions on various boards and committees, and made 32 separate trips across the country, including promotion for a new book. For their day jobs, the eight associate justices earned a healthy pay raise to $244,400, while Chief Justice John Roberts gets a bit extra at $255,500 per year. It was the first salary increase for members of the federal bench. The Coalition for Court Transparency, an alliance of legal and media groups, has launched a public campaign, urging the court to post its financial reports online, for the convenience of the press and public. The President and members of Congress already do so. ""The media have the right to know about any activities public officials engage in that may influence how they conduct the people's business,"" said Mike Cavender, executive director of the Radio Television Digital News Association and Foundation. ""That our nation's top judges make it purposely harder to obtain this information -- especially given the Internet-- does not conform to 21st century expectations of transparency from public officials."" All federal judges are required to list on annual financial disclosure forms any out-of-town travel for speeches and other appearances that was paid for by private groups.","Justices release financial disclosure forms .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama is visiting China, Myanmar and Australia this week for a series of key regional summits. The trip is his first opportunity since his Democratic Party's massive defeat in the midterm elections to demonstrate the power of the presidency. Surveys conducted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies show strong support outside China for the President's announced ""pivot"" or ""rebalance"" to the Asia-Pacific region. The same polls show that experts across Asia see great resilience in the U.S. economy and expect -- and want -- America to continue leading Asian integration and cooperation in the future despite the sudden rise of Chinese power. Indeed, it is largely because of the aggressive way China is using its power that allies and partners want more commitment from Washington. Yet like the American people, Asian governments have found Obama's leadership wanting. This isn't for lack of interest in the region -- the President grew up in Indonesia and Hawaii after all. Although his claims to be the first ""Pacific"" president could be challenged by historians who remember that William Howard Taft, for example, had once been governor general in the Philippines, Obama appears genuinely interested in Asia, and his administration has done a better job than any of its predecessors attending regional summits and organizing high-level bilateral meetings. So give the Obama administration an ""A"" for attendance. The problem is class participation. But while the President and his team have sent mixed and confusing signals about their understanding of the power dynamics in Asia and their willingness to do the political lifting at home necessary to make the pivot real, there are two things the President can do during his current trip to try to turn this around. First, he has to articulate clearly and consistently his bottom line. Administration officials claim they have done so repeatedly, but the problem is that every speech and announcement by the administration on Asia differs from the one before. In 2009, the President announced in a summit with then-President Hu Jintao of China that he would respect China's ""core interests"" and then dropped that line after Beijing interpreted it as acquiescence to Chinese demands. In January 2011, the President reversed course when the White House cited China along with Iran as a major threat in the Pentagon's new Strategic Guidance. The Chinese responded by charging the administration with Cold War-style containment. Then, in 2013, national security adviser Susan Rice announced the United States would ""operationalize"" Chinese President Xi Jinping's proposal for a ""New Model of Great Power Relations"" between Washington and Beijing that relegated U.S. allies to second-tier status. Oops. The administration then dropped that formulation, too. The President is speaking on U.S. Asia strategy in Australia at the end of the trip. But he will have to get this right: We stand by our allies, we will work for an open trans-Pacific economic architecture, and we will work to cooperate with China to the greatest extent possible but will not compromise on our values or security commitments. Second, the President has to demonstrate that he has the skills and commitment to complete the critical Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and lock in a model for regional economic integration that sets high standards for openness before China starts using its economic weight to write new rules. This means not only pressuring Japan -- the biggest economy in the talks -- but also showing leadership with Congress. Our partners in the region know that the United States has never completed a trade agreement without first winning congressional support through so-called ""fast track"" authority since the Constitution gives that branch of government and not the President power to complete commercial treaties. Obama's team has decided it will squeeze the best deal out of Japan and others first and then ask Congress for permission. This could work in theory, but the problem is that our partners will not put their best deal on the table until they see evidence the President can deliver Congress. Republicans generally support trade more than Democrats, so this could be an area for bipartisan cooperation -- except that the White House refused even to address the issue before the midterms and is now provoking a partisan fight with promises to bypass Congress on immigration, Iran negotiations and other issues. If Asia, and Japan in particular, see that the President can and will work with Congress on trade, then the talks could essentially be wrapped up this trip. If not, the ""pivot"" will look hollow. Though there are questions in Asia about the President's leadership, especially after the midterm results last week, the public in many parts of the region likes Obama and want him to succeed. And with the rise of China, governments from Canberra to Tokyo need him to succeed. This week may be his best chance to prove he can.","Michael Green: Obama has a chance to show power of the presidency after election .

"(CNN) -- It takes a real man to make the moves on the wife of the most powerful man in the biggest country in the world. Especially when the wife is a civilian major general, her husband is sitting next to her, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Beijing, hobnobbing with the President of the United States and the entire event is being televised. But if 2014 has taught us anything it is that Vladimir Putin is a real man. From grabbing Crimea to finagling a featured role in the Olympic opening ceremonies for his gymnast girlfriend, he has flexed his political muscles as often as his pecs, and according to The Guardian newspaper has become ""a heart-throb among many Chinese women for his macho, man-of-action image."" And the social media-obsessed hordes on the Internet loved it. They loved him draping a shawl over the chilly shoulders of Peng Liyuan on Monday. They loved her taking it. They loved that China's censors later concluded it didn't show their leader, President Xi Jinping, in a good light as a husband (too inattentive) and decided to block the footage within China. Never mind Ebola, ISIS, a historic greenhouse gas deal reached between China and the United States, or anything else about the actual meeting of world leaders that Putin, Xi and President Barack Obama were attending. This small act of courtesy by the scourge of Crimea showed him as adept at grabbing headlines as he is neighboring territories. What does Putin know that others, like Obama, for whom the China meeting is more of a respite from the news than a high-profile visit, do not? Perhaps it is that the viewing public is essentially an adolescent boy. Or more properly, the audiences of the world are -- despite cultural and demographic differences -- pretty much just like the idiots that sat in the back of your eighth-grade history class snoozing through the substance but tittering through anything off-color and titillated by explosion, fights and mayhem. It used to be said that your better newspapers were written to be readable at an eighth-grade reading level. Nowadays in the world of immersive social media, 140-character tweets and never-ending video from smartphones and live feeds worldwide, what does reading have to do with it. The audience giggles and laughs for the same reason they did in Miss Groenwald's class. Because everyone else was doing it. How else do you explain that television producers and Web pundits thought that one subject worthy of debate was a video showing Obama chewing gum at the same APEC meeting in Beijing. Trade talks? Please. The President appeared undignified to some Chinese observers with a taste for the trivial. Said one Chinese social media commentator, ""We made this meeting so luxurious, with singing and dancing, but see Obama, stepping out of his car chewing gum like an idler."" Needless to say, some of America's more right-wing news organizations picked up on the story because it showed Obama in a bad light -- as if plunging popularity ratings and a drubbing in the polls were not enough. Ha. The teacher's socks don't match, Mindy has last year's backpack. That's way more important than, like, geopolitics. This is not entirely new. When George H.W. Bush threw up on the Prime Minister of Japan on a trip awhile back or when Gerald Ford stumbled down a flight of stairs even longer ago, the gaffes became memes, defining these two notable public servants more so than many of their biggest accomplishments. But in recent years, the frequency and ridiculousness of the incidents seem to have accelerated. Whether it is George W. Bush massaging German Chancellor Angela Merkel's shoulders at a summit, or Obama grabbing a selfie with Denmark's attractive Prime Minister at a memorial service for Nelson Mandela, to the apparent displeasure of Michelle Obama, world leader outtakes have become pure click bait. Which is why tonight when you turn on the news, some of it is likely to look a lot like ""The Global Elite's Funniest Home Videos."" But as you gawk and click and click again, remember it's not the media that are at fault. It's you. You're the one who chose to sit in the back of the class with the other nitwits.","David Rothkopf: It takes a real man, Putin, to ""make moves"" on China leader's wife at APEC .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Africa is not a country, and Africans generally do not live in trees or hunt game with spears. Nor do they all walk around in the nude among lions and zebras. Chinedu Ezeamuzie shows some of his company's Web designs after an interview last week. African immigrants to the United States say cartoonish caricatures and a Western media penchant for reporting on Africa's disease, hunger and war -- rather than the continent's successes -- trivialize their cultures. They complain they have trouble dispelling the stereotypes once they arrive in the States. They concede, though, the myths run both ways and some say they were surprised to find their values more often aligned with those of white Americans than African-Americans. ""I have been laughed at because of my accent and asked all the ignorant questions,"" said iReporter Ajah-Aminata N'daw, 25, of Fall River, Massachusetts. ""Questions like: Did I live on a tree? Roam the jungles naked? Have wild animals at home?"" N'daw emigrated from Dakar, Senegal, in 2001. She works in a hair-braiding salon and has met African-Americans who share her values of hard work and family, but in most cases, ""we are raised differently, taught different values and held up to a different moral code."" iReport: Read why N'daw is not African-American . Gaddafi Nkosi, 18, recently graduated from The Piney Woods School, a historically African-American boarding school about 22 miles southeast of Jackson, Mississippi. He has since returned to Pretoria, South Africa, but recalled well the misnomers he faced in the U.S. ""I came down from South Africa and so many people thought that maybe that's a jungle or maybe I'd go out chasing lions or something like that,"" he said.  African, black students find common ground at Mississippi school » . Nkosi's American classmates acknowledge their misconceptions. Cydney Smith, 17, of Nashville, Tennessee, said she once believed Africa was populated with ""uncivilized tribes."" Raphael Craig, 17, of Hyattsville, Maryland, said the television misinformed him as well. Before Craig visited the continent in 2005 and 2006, he thought of Africans as ""half-naked, running around with tigers in the jungle,"" Craig said, confessing he was unaware tigers roam only Asia. But in Ghana and Nigeria, Craig saw children playing the same games he and his siblings played. He saw many signs of modernity, including Mercedes and other brands of cars found in the United States. ""OK, this country is running how we're running, just two different schools,"" Craig recalled thinking. ""It really opened my eyes to the point that everything you see on TV is not always the actual thing."" If the Western media are doing Africans no favors, then the African media are also a disservice to African-Americans because it portrays them as criminals, some immigrants say. Sandi Litia, 19, a Piney Woods graduate from Limulunga, Zambia, said she was initially scared of African-Americans because the African media show them ""wearing clothes like gangsters and killing each other."" Nkosi concurred that African media ""made it seem as if they were these aggressive people that did nothing constructive with their lives except occupy prison space."" Trying to fit in . Chinedu Ezeamuzie, 21, of Athens, Georgia, arrived in 2003. He had spent the majority of his life in Jabriya, Kuwait, and came to the U.S. to pursue his education. The recent Georgia Tech graduate said he considers himself Nigerian because his parents -- both from the village of Uga -- instilled in their four children strong Nigerian values of family, community, spirituality and self-betterment.  Test your Africa knowledge with a quiz » . In Athens, Ezeamuzie found his ideals at odds with those who shared his skin color at Clarke Central High School, his first stint in a public school. On his first day, he donned khakis, a button-down dress shirt and nice leather shoes. He caught the African-Americans' attention upon stepping into the cafeteria, he said. ""They give me the look,"" he said. ""Why is this guy dressed like the white folks, like the preppy guys?"" Ezeamuzie didn't understand why so few black students were in his advanced-placement classes. He didn't understand the de facto lunchroom segregation or the accusing glances he got for eating with white classmates. One classmate called him a traitor and asked, ""Do you not like black people?"" ""My whole life I had reaped benefits from being in different circles and bridging them,"" so he wanted to fit in, he said. iReport: What are the unique struggles of being African in America? He found clothes akin to what he saw many African-Americans wearing --- baggy pants and an oversized T-shirt. He relaxed his British-trained tongue and tried out for the basketball team, the 6-foot-5 Ezeamuzie said. Ezeamuzie recalled finding himself more confused by his experience with some African-Americans: Why were they so cliquish? Why did they mock students for being intelligent? Why were they homophobic and bent on using the n-word? Why did every conversation seem to involve drugs, girls or materialism? ""They kind of accepted me. They saw me a little differently, but I was thinking this is a very narrow mindset,"" Ezeamuzie said. Ezeamuzie and other Africans say they feel African-Americans too often dwell on slavery and the racism that has persisted for more than a century since the Emancipation Proclamation. ""We have all been tortured,"" said iReporter Vera Ezimora, 24, a Nigerian student living in Baltimore, Maryland. ""Now that we are free, holding on to the sins of white men who have long died and gone to meet their maker is more torture than anything we have suffered."" iReport: Read about questions Ezimora faced when she came to the U.S. Values at core of misunderstanding? Martin Mohammed, president of the U.S. African Chamber of Commerce, estimates there are 3 million African immigrants in the U.S. -- about twice the U.S. Census Bureau estimate. He has heard from numerous immigrants struggling to find commonalities with Americans who share their skin color. Mohammed emigrated from Somalia in 1998 and is now naturalized. He considers himself African-American, but ""it does not mean that I have already assimilated into the culture."" Values and upbringings may lie at the center of the cultures' misunderstanding of each other, he said. Many Africans come to the U.S. to escape dire conditions such as poverty or civil war. Their objectives are often advancing their education or finding good jobs, Mohammed said. They also strive to reunite their families, or at least support them back home. Remittances from the U.S. to Africa total about $20 billion annually, according to the World Bank. However, African immigrants find that education and good jobs elude their African-American brethren, and there is a perception that many African-American men aren't committed to supporting their families, Mohammed said. The two cultures have much to teach each other -- especially politically and economically -- but they must accept they have something to learn. ""Honestly, what we need to do is realize both cultures are important,"" Mohammed said. Myths thrive on ignorance . iReporter Emeka Aniukwu, 35, hails from Ebenebe, Nigeria, and said he has heard all the American misperceptions about Africa, but the cure to ignorance is communication. He began dating Sonya Roberts, 25, of Austin, Texas, shortly after he arrived in the U.S. in March 2005. She taught him about African-American culture, and he taught her about Nigeria. The couple married two years ago. ""Talk to people, stop showing ugly face and don't be shy about your accent,"" he advised African immigrants. ""Most of the media coverage about Africa is all about hunger, diseases and war, so what do you expect? People are curious and just want to know, so calm down and educate them as much as you can."" iReport: Read why Aniukwu loves Africa-Americans . At Piney Woods, where about 35 of the 200 students emigrate from Africa, the school's president, Reginald Nichols, concurs that education is integral to understanding. He's heard Africans say the African-Americans are aggressive, while the African-Americans accuse Africans of being reserved -- but the more they mingle the more they mesh, he said. ""You have the African students tell me that they have learned so much about standing up from the African-American students, and the African-American students said they've learned how to simmer down, so it's a wonderful thing,"" Nichols said. Mohammed, too, said he'd like to see more African-Americans dispelling myths about Africa, which is increasingly important as Africans in the U.S. begin wielding more economic influence. The chamber estimates African immigrants have about $50 billion in annual purchasing power. Numbers from the University of Georgia's Selig Center of Economic Growth indicate the number is just behind the nation's Native American community, which had $61.8 billion in buying power last year. The entire African-American market was estimated at $913 billion and the Hispanic market at $951 billion. History dictates that economic power precedes political power. Mohammed said Africans can learn much about politics from African-Americans because of their ""level of influence in Washington."" ""I'm also interested to the extent that the black population can play a role in solving global conflict. We can help these discussions around the globe, but we must begin here in the U.S.A.,"" he said. iReporter Faraji Goredenna, 53, of Layton, Utah, said he encourages African-Americans to learn more about Africa and lend a hand to Africans so they know ""America's institutions and opportunities are open to them, too."" iReport: Read how Goredenna embraces both cultures . But he'd like a symbiotic relationship, he said, explaining, ""We African-Americans want to learn more about our history and culture as it exists in Africa, but we have also created a culture for ourselves here that we ask our brothers and sisters from Africa to respect.""

"(CNN) -- He's the most expensive footballer in the world, but Cristiano Ronaldo is proving to be an absolute bargain buy for Real Madrid. The Portugal forward took his goal tally to an incredible 49 in 47 league games since his $130 million move from Manchester United in 2009 as he fired his fourth hat-trick this season in Sunday night's 4-2 win over third-placed Villarreal. The visitors had threatened to become the first team to win at the Santiago Bernabeu this season, leading 2-1 after 18 minutes, but Ronaldo completed his treble to put Real ahead and then set up a clinching goal by substitute Kaka to keep his side two points behind leaders Barcelona. Kaka was delighted after his winning contribution, and also hailed Ronaldo's heroics. Who is the world's best footballer? ""He has decided many matches and will continue to do so for Real Madrid. He is a great player that stuns us all day after day with goals and his way of playing. He is fundamental to this team,"" the former world player of the year said. ""To return to the Bernabeu and score was such a special moment. It had been a long time since I scored, so it was very important to me. I felt such raw emotion from the crowd."" Ronaldo has now scored 22 goals in 18 La Liga games this season, and 31 overall. With defending champions Barca having beaten Deportivo La Coruna 4-0 on Saturday, Real were rocked when Ruben Cani put Villarreal ahead in the sixth minute. But Ronaldo was on hand to equalize from close range three minutes later after Karim Benzema and Mesut Ozil combined well to set him up. Benzema was starting up front in the continued absence of Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain, who will have back surgery on Tuesday. The Real squad took to the pitch wearing shirts supporting him with the words ""Stay strong Pipa. Get well soon."" But it was Villarreal who scored next as Marco Ruben beat the offside trap and sent a delightful chip over goalkeeper Iker Casillas for his first goal for the club. Ronaldo struck a vital blow when he equalized in the first minute of time added on, stealing a header from Xabi Alonso's free-kick. But Real struggled to find a winner until Kaka came on for his first home appearance this season with 20 minutes to play, having returned as a substitute in the meaningless midweek Spanish Cup second-leg defeat at Levante. Nine minutes later the Brazilian's cross was not dealt with by Villarreal keeper Diego Lopez, and Ronaldo finally fired in a low shot after the ball ran loose -- though he appeared to have come back from an offside position. There was no doubt about the fourth goal on 82 minutes, as Ronaldo slipped a clever pass into the box and Kaka poked the ball past Lopez. Real coach Jose Mourinho's wild celebrations prompted an angry reaction on the Villarreal bench, with coach Juan Carlos Garrido already sent off for protesting the third goal. Real return to action on Thursday for the first leg of the Spanish Cup quarterfinal against city rivals Atletico, who travel to Hercules in La Liga on Monday. In Sunday's other games, fourth-placed Valencia closed the gap on Villarreal to two points after a controversial 1-0 win in the derby at Levante. Juan Mata followed up his late winner in last weekend's win over Espanyol with another goal that appeared to be offside as he broke free to score with seven minutes left. The winger missed a first-half penalty, clipping the top of the crossbar, and then in the second half he had a curling free-kick tipped onto the woodwork. Espanyol are a point back in fifth after thrashing bottom club Real Zaragoza 4-0 at home, while Mallorca joined sixth-placed Atletico and Getafe on 27 points with a 4-1 win over relegation-threatened Almeria. Getafe could only draw 0-0 at Osasuna, who moved five points clear of the bottom three. Sporting Gijon moved above Almeria and Zaragoza on goal difference after drawing 1-1 at Racing Santander thanks to a 90th-minute equalizer from midfielder Diego Castro.","Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick inspires Real Madrid to 4-2 win over third-placed Villarreal .

"(CNN) -- I'm just as reactionary and just as outraged as the next Internet user when I learn that a service I've been using for free is going to start selling my information to market researchers or excerpting my posts and pictures for its clients' advertisements or charging me good money to communicate with an online cohort that might have taken me years to build. Such is the case with Instagram, a free photo-sharing app for smart phones. Millions of people have downloaded the free app and have been busy taking and sharing photos of themselves and their fascinations. Instagram has risen to the level of a Twitter as far as the culture around it is concerned. It has spawned a new visual language, a new etiquette of sharing and an outpouring of creativity in the form of contests, collaborative art exhibits and personal expression. Instagram got so popular so fast that Facebook took notice and purchased the company for a billion dollars -- (yes, $1 billion) -- to bolster its own smart phone presence shortly before its IPO. The problem with being bought for a billion dollars is that eventually you have to start showing the kinds of returns expected for a billion dollar company. That means either charging users for the service or, as in the case of Instagram, selling the users' data. Instagram plans to use the photos people upload in targeted ads -- much as Facebook now uses our friends' updates as the substance for advertisements called sponsored stories, as in: ""John says: My Starbucks coffee tastes great today."" So now, presumably, John's picture of Starbucks will serve that same purpose -- creating a contextual advertisement. Instead of simply uploading and distributing our photos, we are working for the man. Well, what did we expect? Did we think Instagram was just a couple of self-funded slackers trying to make the world a more photographic place? Simple though it may be, Instagram is also a massive platform of servers and storage. There are people working there, coding the software, designing the interface, and figuring out how anyone gets to look at anything whenever they want to. They need to eat. In a tactic now familiar to Facebook users, Instagram founder Kevin Systrom issued a blog post backtracking significantly from the original announcement and assured users that the company has no plans to use their photos in ads. But the damage has been done, and the Instagram community is on notice that they may not own the rights to the photos they upload. If they had charged for the service from the get-go, Instagram would have likely had many fewer takers. Photo services from Yahoo's Flickr to Google's Picasa already existed. So instead of charging for their service, Instagram decided to get the biggest base of users it could, use its massive membership as leverage to sell itself, and then let the buyer (in this case Facebook) figure out how to make money. In essence, Instagram sold its users to Facebook. We were never the customers, we were the product. So now that Facebook intends to cash in on its investment, it's a bit disingenuous for those of us using the free service to cry foul. We may be entitled to free Internet (though that's a topic for another column), but we are not entitled to free services. Unless, of course, we're willing to barter with something else, such as our consumer profiles or our photo streams. What irks us, of course, is the sense that we've been betrayed. Instagram felt a little alternative, authentically bottom-up. It's a tiny piece of software, and if they had figured out a way for us to store our photos locally or to pay a small charge for server space exceeding some amount (as Flickr does), it could have stayed a rather noncommercial affair. Moreover, Instagram's community, perhaps rightly, feels as though it was responsible for its own formation. Even though this community formed around a piece of commercial software, the relationships within it are real and the result of a significant investment of time and energy and trust. Now that those relationships have turned out to be commodities, many people feel exposed and cheated. No longer the users, but the used. Sorry, but -- in a word -- tough. This is the way of the Internet: pay or, well, pay. Just as Facebook's users must come to grips with the fact that they can longer reach all their friends with an update unless they pay for ""promotion,"" Instagram's users must reconcile themselves to the fact that their photographic creations are now grist for some advertiser's mill. After all the time and energy put into one's profile or network or photo stream, the ground rules seem to change. And those rules seem to change just at the moment our investment and connections seem too large to make it worth jumping off to some other service, if one exists. Yes, sometimes it's hard to learn just where in a company's business plan one fits. But let's hope these early experiences of investing in free stuff only to learn the true cost will make us more ready to think twice about when and how we wish to participate. For if we're not paying in money, we'll end up paying with something else. The opinions expressed in thim commentary are soley those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: Instagram users need to consider meaning of free .

"(CNN) -- San Francisco's new sheriff is facing misdemeanor charges over an alleged domestic abuse incident on New Year's Eve, authorities said. Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi, who was sworn in Monday, said Friday he will not resign. ""We are cooperating with law enforcement and the district attorney's office and will, of course, continue to do so,"" he told reporters. The charges were announced by San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon, who also took office Monday. Mirkarimi is accused of domestic violence with battery, child endangerment and dissuading a witness. Gascon said there were a series of text messages between the sheriff and his wife, Eliana Lopez, the alleged victim, about the incident.

"(CNN) -- A Kuwaiti man tied to al Qaeda, who was in Afghanistan in the days after 9/11, is out of the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he'd been held for the last 12 years, the Pentagon said Tuesday. The Defense Department announced the transfer of Fawzi al-Odah to the Kuwaiti government. It wasn't immediately clear how Kuwait will handle al-Odah's case, including if he'll be freed totally. Regardless, the move represents a major milestone for al-Odah, who has pressed for his release for years and whose family has long professed his innocence. According to a 2010 U.S. appeals court document on his case, al-Odah, who was born in Kuwait City in 1977, traveled to Afghanistan in August 2001. He says he went there to do charity work and teach the Quran, the Muslim holy text, to the poor and needy; the U.S. government says he went to join the Taliban in its fight against the Northern Alliance. Upon his arrival, al-Odah met with a Taliban official who he said took him to schools around the Afghan countryside. Federal prosecutors dispute this assertion, saying that al-Odah couldn't name any of the schools he went to, fellow teachers or students. He was in the longtime Taliban stronghold of Kandahar on September 11, 2001, the day that members of al Qaeda -- the terrorist group led by Osama bin Laden that had found a home in Afghanistan -- hijacked four U.S. commercial airliners and crashed them, killing nearly 3,000 people. Al-Odah rented a car and drove to eastern Afghanistan's Logar province, contending that he wanted to leave the country. But he did not, instead staying there about a month before acquiring an AK-47 rifle that he had while walking around the mountainous Tora Bora region with about 150 men. Tora Bora is where U.S. forces and their allies cornered bin Laden in December 2001, before he managed to escape into Pakistan, according to a U.S. Senate report. His group came under attack at one point, but al-Odah survived unscathed. Yet his ordeal came to an end in late 2001, when Pakistani guards detained him at Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. Al-Odah was then passed to U.S. authorities, and he was moved to Guantanamo Bay in early 2002. Federal authorities have tied al-Odah to al Qaeda on a number of fronts, including that his name appeared in a document on the terrorist group's official website and that his passport was found in an al Qaeda safe house . Yet his father, who fought alongside U.S. forces in the first Gulf War, says al-Odah has been wrongly imprisoned. ""He went in 2001, trying to help people and teach them,"" Khalif al-Odah told CNN in January 2003. ""Then 9/11 happened, and he was caught there during the war."" Al-Odah's release leaves 148 prisoners still at Guantanamo Bay, which was repurposed after the September 11, 2001, attacks to hold detainees in the so-called war on terror. Since they were not on American soil, then-President George W. Bush's administration said Guantanamo detainees were not covered by the U.S. Constitution and instead were ""enemy combatants,"" a label that gave them limited legal protections. President Barack Obama signed an executive order to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center days after his 2009 inauguration. Yet, while the number of detainees has dwindled -- through releases like that of al-Odah, as well as controversial swaps this year of five prisoners for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, an American soldier captured in Afghanistan -- the facility remains open.

"(CNN) -- Smartphones just got smarter - or at least more expensive. With a price tag of $250,000, Savelli smartphones come complete with 18-carat white gold casing encrusted with precious diamonds. It's as much a piece of jewelery as a gadget. The mission of its makers, the Geneva-based jeweler Savelli, was to ""elevate a phone into haute couture."" ""It's the most important object one has with them all the time -- it's in your hand, it's in your pocket, it's next to you when you sleep, you can touch it 100 times a day,"" Alessandro Savelli, the firm's CEO, told CNN's Nina dos Santos. The jeweler is hoping to win the hearts of luxury shoppers, with the brand focusing exclusively on women. ""I think our customers are really looking for something special, really a beautiful object which they use every day and is extremely visible and really makes part of their persona,"" Savelli said. The limited collection features 11 smartphones powered by Google Android system and decorated with luxury materials, such as sapphires and emeralds, and finished off with ostrich, python and iguana leather. The two most expensive models are limited to only 27 pieces. The hand-made Emerald Night, is embellished with 18-carat rose gold and 400 brilliant-cut emeralds, while Emerald Insane features 75 baguette-cut emeralds on white gold. The same techniques and materials used in jewelry manufacture are used to produce the phones, Savelli said. ""We don't really see the mobile phone industry as a competitor,"" Savelli said. ""We see more the watch and jewelery as our universe."" After launching in Europe, the brand is now looking towards the east and emerging markets, such as China, Middle East and Russia, where the luxury business is booming.","Savelli smartphones come complete with 18-carat white gold casing .

"(CNN) -- A day after the deadly failed test flight of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, there were words of strength in the face of adversity. The pilots' bravery cannot be overstated, Virgin Group Founder Richard Branson said. The goal of commercial spaceflight remains unchanged, he added. But with one pilot's death, injuries to another and the loss of the aircraft, there are questions that must be answered along with the inspiring words. Virgin Galactic, Branson admitted, will not ""push on blindly."" To that end, a team of 13 to 15 investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were on site in the Mojave Desert, where the debris from SpaceShipTwo was scattered over a five-mile area. The test aircraft went down about 20 miles northeast of Mojave. ""This was a test flight, and test flights are typically very well-documented in terms of data,"" NTSB Acting Chairman Christopher A. Hart said. ""We may have lots of evidence that will help us with the investigative process, and we appreciate that."" While answers for what went wrong with the test flight might be days away, Virgin Galactic and its partner in Mojave, Scaled Composites, identified the pilots at the controls of the aircraft. Michael Tyner Alsbury, 39, died in the Friday incident. He was the co-pilot, Scaled Composites said. Peter Siebold, 43, was identified as the pilot who survived the crash. He suffered moderate injuries and was airlifted to Antelope Valley Hospital for treatment, the Kern County Sheriff's Office said. ""We have not (interviewed him) because doctors did not recommend we do an interview at this stage,"" Hart said. The two test pilots had logged many years of flight experience each, according to biographies of the men. Deadly day for space tourism -- but future 'rests' on such days, official says . Deputies first located Siebold, who'd parachuted to the ground, and later found the body of Alsbury, according to a news release from the Kern County Sheriff. Alsbury worked at Scaled Composites for more than a dozen years and served as a project engineer and test pilot, according to a bio for a 2013 symposium for the Society of Flight Test Engineers. He was the co-pilot for both SpaceShipTwo's first glide and first powered flight, the bio said, and logged more than 1,600 hours as test pilot and test engineer in Scaled aircraft. He had a degree in aeronautical engineering from California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California. Siebold had worked for Scaled Composites since 1996, according to his biography on the company website, and had 17 years and more than 2,000 hours of flight experience. The company bio said he was responsible for the development of the simulator, avionics/navigation system and ground control system for the SpaceShipOne Program. He participated in flight testing for the scaled model of the 316 SpaceShipOne. Like Alsbury, he obtained a degree in aerospace engineering from California Polytechnic University. 'Bravery of test pilots cannot be overstated' On Saturday, Branson said investigators will find out what caused the Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo to break apart. ""We are determined to find out what went wrong,"" he said at a news conference. Branson said everybody knows commercial space travel is ""an incredibly hard project."" ""This is the biggest test program ever carried out in commercial aviation history to ensure that this never happens to the public,"" he said. ""The bravery of test pilots cannot be overstated. Nobody underestimates the risks involved in space travel."" The company, he said, will not ""push on blindly."" ""To do so would be an insult to all those affected by this tragedy,"" he said. ""We're going to learn from what went wrong, discover how we can improve safety and performance and then move forward together."" When asked about the future of Virgin Galactic, Branson said the company's goal is still putting people safely into space. ""I think millions of people in the world would love one day to have the chance to go to space, and this is the start of a long program,"" he said. Still, he said, the company will gladly give refunds to anybody who had already purchased a flight. Nothing seemed abnormal before incident . The first sign there was a problem with Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo came at about 45,000 feet, just two minutes after the spaceplane separated from the jet-powered aircraft that carried it aloft. It wasn't something overt with SpaceShipTwo, said Stuart Witt, the chief executive of Mojave Air & Space Port in California, where it was launched and monitored. It was what didn't happen next during the test flight, he said. Witt did not offer details but appeared to indicate the spaceplane did not follow its previous test-flight patterns. Nothing seemed abnormal during the takeoff or flight before the spaceplane's failure, Witt told reporters. For years, Virgin Galactic has planned to sell trips in which SpaceShipTwo transports passengers about 62 miles above Earth -- the beginning of outer space -- and lets them experience a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to ground. The incident occurred shortly after SpaceShipTwo separated from WhiteKnightTwo, the vehicle designed to carry it aloft, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The jet-powered WhiteKnightTwo returned safely to the Mojave Air & Space Port, Witt said. Questions are being raised about a new fuel mixture used after Scaled Composites President Kevin Mickey said it had been ground-tested a number of times, but Friday's flight was the first time it was used in a test flight. It's unclear what the failure of the spaceplane will mean for the program. Virgin Galactic planned to send paying customers on SpaceShipTwo as early as next year. Virgin has sold more than 700 tickets, each costing more than $250,000, for future flights. Several celebrities have already signed up, including Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher, Leonardo DiCaprio and Stephen Hawking. With composite lightweight materials, ""feathered"" rudders capable of turning 90 degrees and a hybrid rocket engine, SpaceShipTwo is as safe as modern technology can make it. As designer and aviator Burt Rutan put it in 2008, ""This vehicle is designed to go into the atmosphere in the worst case straight in or upside down and it'll correct."" Opinion: The truth about launching spaceships . CNN's Mariano Castillo, Mayra Cuevas, Paul Vercammen, Michael Martinez, Mike Ahlers, Rosalina Nieves, Sonya Hamasaki, Shelby Lin Erdman and Todd Leopold contributed to this report.","Pilot who survived identified as Peter Siebold, 43, Sheriff's Office says .

"(CNN) -- It would have been the ultimate supergroup: the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan. And it was actually proposed, says engineer and producer Glyn Johns, according to a piece in Rolling Stone. According to Johns' new memoir, ""Sound Man,"" while traveling with Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner he ran into Dylan in New York sometime in 1969. The singer had just done an interview with Wenner and started peppering Johns with questions about the two bands. Johns had worked with the Beatles in early 1969 on the ""Get Back"" sessions -- later to become ""Let It Be"" -- and the Stones on 1968's ""Beggars Banquet,"" so he had recent experience with both. Then Dylan dropped a bombshell. ""He said he had this idea to make a record with the Beatles and the Stones,"" Johns writes. ""And he asked me if I would find out whether the others would be interested. I was completely bowled over. Can you imagine the three greatest influences on popular music in the previous decade making an album together?"" The artists had crossed paths in various combinations before. Lennon and McCartney wrote ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" for the Stones and later sang on the Stones' ""We Love You."" Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were at the TV taping of the Beatles' ""All You Need Is Love."" Lennon appeared in the Stones' ""Rock and Roll Circus"" film. Dylan met the Beatles in 1964 and introduced them to marijuana. The Beatles, Bob and Mick: 50 years since pop culture's youth revolution . Johns ran the idea by the bands' members. Harrison and Richards were all for it, he says, and others were noncommittal. But Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger said ""absolutely not,"" Johns writes. A shame, Johns adds, as he had the sessions all planned out. ""We would pool the best material from Mick and Keith, Paul and John, Bob and George, and then select the best rhythm section from the two bands to suit whichever songs we were cutting,"" he writes. But, he observes, ""Paul and Mick were probably right.""","Glyn Johns says Dylan proposed recording with Beatles, Stones .

"(CNN) -- The family of NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia, is cautiously optimistic after doctors said that his condition at a Nebraska hospital has improved slightly. With developments pouring in from all corners of the world, here's what you need to know to quickly get caught up: . WEST AFRICA . No relief in sight: . The number of deaths attributed to the current Ebola outbreak has climbed to 4,033, the World Health Organization reported Friday. The tally brings the total number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola to 8,399. The numbers were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States. A possible $32 billion hit: . The outbreak could cost the African economy $32 billion over the next two years if it spreads to its larger neighbors, the World Bank estimates. The steps some countries have taken to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus amount to ""putting a towel under the door of a building on fire,"" World Bank president Jim Kim told CNN's Richard Quest on Thursday. Complete coverage on Ebola . Liberia postpones election: . Liberia's President on Thursday postponed a senatorial election that had been set for next week, citing the Ebola outbreak in the country. The nation's election commission had recommended the delay, saying that the prevalence of the virus, authorities' efforts to combat it and citizens' efforts to isolate themselves weren't conducive to a free and open election. Officials have not yet revealed any new date for the election, which had been set for Tuesday. U.S. troops arrive in Liberia: . A group of 90 U.S. Marines and airmen arrived in Liberia on Thursday to help Ebola response efforts, along with four V-22 Osprey aircraft and two C-130 transport planes. Their arrival brings the total number of U.S. troops deployed in Liberia to 334, military spokesman Lt. Col. Dave Doherty said. And there are more coming. In late October, 700 troops from the 101st Airborne Division are scheduled to deploy to Liberia. U.S. CASES . 'Modest improvement' for NBC cameraman . The condition of Ashoka Mukpo, the American citizen who got infected in Liberia, has shown ""very modest improvement,"" according to The Nebraska Medical Center, where he is being treated. Mukpo, a cameraman for NBC, is receiving an experimental drug called brincidofovir, or CMX001. ""Mr. Mukpo's condition is slightly improved,"" medical director Dr. Phil Smith said. ""He's been taking in some fluids and drinking Gatorade. But everyone needs to be reminded that this is still a very serious illness we're dealing with and no one has a lot of experience treating it."" Thomas Duncan dies: . Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, died Wednesday, 10 days after he was admitted to Dallas' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. His family wonders whether the outcome would have been different if doctors had admitted Duncan to a hospital on September 25, the first time he showed up with a fever and stomach pain. Duncan's family has criticized the care he received. The Dallas hospital that treated him says staff members did everything they could. Ebola test negative for Dallas deputy: . An Ebola test was negative for a Dallas deputy who was hospitalized with possible symptoms of the deadly virus, officials said. The deputy, Sgt. Michael Monnig, didn't have any direct contact with Duncan but had reported contact with Duncan's family. Physicians at Texas Health Presbyterian discharged him Thursday, soon after the negative test came back, hospital spokeswoman Candace White said. New travel screening: . Five of America's biggest, busiest airports are beefing up measures. Now, people arriving from the three nations hardest hit by Ebola will get special screening, including having their temperature taken. The airports are: New York's JFK, Washington Dulles, Newark, Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta international airports. IN OTHER COUNTRIES . Spain to create a committee to fight Ebola: . The Spanish government will create a special committee to tackle the Ebola crisis, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria told reporters Friday in Madrid. The committee, which will include representatives from government and health care, will coordinate national efforts to control the virus and establish protocols to deal with it, she said. Spain ramps up response: . After a nurse's assistant in Spain became the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, five people related to the case were being monitored in a Madrid hospital, including her husband, an emergency room doctor and the neighborhood doctor who saw her before the case was confirmed. Sporadic infections unavoidable, the WHO says: . Sporadic Ebola infections will be unavoidable in some European countries because of direct travel from their hubs to hotspot areas in West Africa, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. But the risk of spread, it said, is avoidable and extremely low. Australia scare: . A 57-year-old woman who returned to Australia after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone has been isolated at a hospital and is undergoing tests, including one for the deadly virus, authorities said. She had isolated herself at home and checked her temperature twice daily since her return, as recommended by national guidelines. The Queensland Department of Health announced early Friday that initial tests on the woman came back negative for Ebola. United Kingdom: . The UK's Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar railway terminals will begin screening passengers arriving from Ebola-affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, a government spokesman said. Screening will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history, who they have been in contact with and future travel arrangements, as well as a possible assessment performed by medical personnel. CNN's Greg Botelho, Alexander Felton, Khushbu Shah, Saskya Vandoorne, Richard Quest, Brent Swails and Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.","Spain creates a committee to tackle the Ebola crisis .

"(CNN) -- He's the face and voice of Mexico's strategy against drug trafficking and organized crime. In his capacity as national security spokesman, Alejandro Poire has the unenviable task of telling Mexicans -- and the world -- about his government's fight against organized crime, which have been widely criticized. CNN's Rafael Romo asked Poire 10 questions about the status of Mexico's war on drugs. More than 34,000 people have died in drug-related violence during the four years that President Felipe Calderon has been in power. Based on your own estimates, last year was the worst with 15,273 deaths. Is violence in Mexico out of control? The level of violence last year was the highest that we have had in a long time, but it is also the case that towards the end of the last year and the last trimester we saw a significant decrease in the number of deaths overall in Mexico. We have a comprehensive strategy and we have shown significant successes. We have seen an increase in violent incidents in places like Acapulco, which used to be safe. How widespread is violence in Mexico? Violence is heavily concentrated. Fifty percent of all deaths last year in Mexico happened in only three out of 32 states in the country -- Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas. Thirty percent occurred in the state of Chihuahua and one of every five in Ciudad Juarez [across the border from El Paso, Texas]. Is it time to change Mexico's anti-drug strategy? We can get a hold of this violence. We have shown it in other parts of the country and we will do it because we have a comprehensive strategy to address crime and violence. Can you mention a place where the current strategy is working? In Tijuana we saw a very significant upsurge in violence during the year 2008. But thanks to a very strong presence of the federal forces, the increase in intelligence capabilities, and the very good coordination with state and local authorities, the level of violence has gone down, as well as kidnappings, car thefts, and extortion. Mexican police are often overwhelmed by the drug cartels which often have more powerful weapons. What has your government done to strengthen police agencies? We began the administration with less than 6,500 federal police officers. Now we have over 35,000 with 7,000 of them having college degrees from the top universities in Mexico. These are all policemen that are vetted on a systematic basis. They can be excluded from the forces if they have any type of misconduct. Three-thousand were dismissed last year for that reason. In what ways has the current strategy been effective? In March 2009, we announced that we were looking for 37 of the most wanted and dangerous criminals in Mexico, the leaders of organizations which have grown significantly over time and have very significant logistical and organizational capabilities. To date, we have detained or brought down 20 out of this 37 criminals and that's just one aspect of this strategy. We are significantly weakening these organizations. President Calderon has said that the United States demand for drugs fuels violence in Mexico. Has this negatively affected the relationship? We have a very significant and very fruitful and productive relationship, but indeed we have significant areas of opportunity. It is clear that the availability of high-powered guns in the United States for Mexican criminals is hurting bilateral security. We would hope to see an overwhelming response from the United States government to prevent these guns from getting into Mexico. Is it time for a Plan Mexico just as it was time for a Plan Colombia 10 years ago? We have the Merida Initiative and the most important part of it is that it recognizes our [Mexico and the United States] shared responsibility. It began during the Bush administration, at the urging of President Calderon. The Obama administration has supported it as well and agrees with the concept of shared responsibility. As we like to say, it takes two to tango. What do you say to Mexicans who are suffering the effects of violence? We understand and share the feeling of frustration of people who live in certain areas of our country. President Calderon has responded with a very significant and comprehensive strategy from the beginning of his administration. We have listened to proposals by civil groups. From those proposals, we have sent [anti-drug] initiatives to congress to address the illegal flow of money and improve police forces. Other than law enforcement, what are you doing to curb violence in Mexico? We have opened up 75 new universities during the current administration. The number of young Mexicans with access to a high school education has increased by one million. We have also opened 330 drug rehabilitation centers and implemented drug prevention programs in 20,000 schools around the country. We have also launched a reform of our judicial system to make it more transparent and efficient.","Mexican national security spokesman says killings down in last trimester 2010, despite record high for year .

"Beheira Province, Egypt (CNN) -- Amre Moussa sweeps through chaotic crowds in Egypt's Beheira province, hailed in the pandemonium by his supporters as ""ar-rayis,"" the president. In the nation's first democratic presidential election, Moussa is one of a few candidates who can boast of any practical government experience. He served as foreign minister under Hosni Mubarak and headed the Arab League. Now, he's one of the top contenders in the voting to be held Wednesday and Thursday. Experience, however, can be a thorn in a nation where 18 days of fervent, anti-government uprising last year toppled Mubarak's decades-long dictatorship. Moussa, 75, is intent on turning that liability into gain. ""They have to select and elect a president who can do the job, not a president beginner who will just get into learning or quarreling with others,"" Moussa says between campaign stops through Egypt's Nile Delta region. And he has been trying to reassure Egyptians that a vote for him is not a betrayal of the revolution. ""We want to ensure that every citizen in all of Egypt -- in the north, south, east and west -- that the state is moving in the right way to progress and to respond to people's requirements,"" he said in a televised debate earlier this month. Moussa's message has been resonating with Egyptians in all sectors of society. Among them the wealthy industrialists and Coptic Christians who believe Moussa can help stem the tide of Islamism. But Moussa also has support in poorer, more densely populated provinces, where people long for the stability associated with the old regime. ""We need a leader to steer this ship and Amre Moussa can do it,"" says Suhair, a nurse in the Delta. ""He's a diplomat. He's been around the world and can work with other countries to help Egypt."" Campaign manager Hisham Youssef says supporters see Moussa as a healing force in a turbulent time. ""He has been working on issues pertaining to reconciliation all over the Arab world for the last decade or two,"" Youssef told NPR. ""So this is one of the reasons why he can be instrumental in trying to achieve the objective of reconciliation and healing at a time when Egypt needs that most."" Moussa graduated in 1957 from Cairo University with a law degree. The following year, he joined Egypt's foreign ministry, launching a long career in diplomacy. He served as Egypt's ambassador to the United Nations as well as to India before Mubarak named him foreign minister in 1991. Moussa was popular in that role, channeling anger at Egypt's peace treaty with Israel in his favor with vociferous criticism of his Jewish neighbors. He was even the subject of a popular song in 2000 with these lyrics: ""I hate Israel but I love Amre Moussa."" ""You might think that such Israel-bashing lyrics would cause some discomfort for an official whose job at the time involved his country's ultra-sensitive diplomatic relations with the Jewish state,"" says a 2001 Time magazine story. But not for Moussa apparently. ""I was kind of gratified,"" Moussa told Time, while puffing on a Cuban cigar. ""Why should it bother me? It is a message: We can't accept injustice done to the Palestinians."" The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs described him as ""no ordinary Egyptian government official"" who ""has achieved enormous popularity because of the charismatic style with which he has dealt with the Israelis."" Moussa says his goal now is to reclaim his homeland's position as the Arab world's most influential nation. ""My point of reference is Egypt. Nothing else,"" he says in between Delta campaign stops in hot, stuffy tents. He begins to talk about ways to deal with international treaties but celebratory gunfire drowns his voice, interrupting his thoughts. But he has made it clear that his opinions are not those of Mubarak's, including on Israel. ""Mubarak had a certain policy, it was his own policy and I don't think we have to follow this,"" Moussa recently told The Wall Street Journal. ""We want to be a friend of Israel, but it has to have two parties, it is not on Egypt to be a friend. Israel has to be a friend, too."" He has frequently been cited as the civilian figure Egyptians would elect as president if they had a real choice, according to The Wall Street Journal article. Mubarak sent off Moussa to become secretary-general of the Arab League in 2001, a move rife with rumors that the dictator felt threatened by his minister's popular standing. Now, with Egypt's political landscape vastly changed, Moussa is poised to take the helm. But not everyone wants to see him assume the nation's top job and Moussa finds himself in a delicate dance with Egypt's new kingmakers -- the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and the Islamists. Both are certain to demand concessions in exchange for support. Moussa is likely the military's choice, according to Isobel Coleman, senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. He has ""vowed to give the military a voice in key policy decisions through a national security council that would include top military officers,"" Coleman wrote in a CNN.com commentary. In many ways, the election is a battle between an Islamic vision of Egypt and a more secular, nationalist one. A chunk of Egyptians favor a stronger role for Islam. Moussa is not their man. Moussa runs into some of his opposition in the Delta, where some accuse him of being a ""faloul,"" a derogatory term for a holdover from the Mubarak regime. One young man defiantly displays a poster of Mohamed Morsi, the candidate of the formerly banned Muslim Brotherhood. Above, on a balcony, a veiled woman and her children show their disapproval with a thumbs down. Campaigning is a new thing for people in the Delta, and for that matter, everywhere in Egypt, and Moussa is determined to meet voters, go places where Mubarak never did. He has visited each of Egypt's 27 governorates during his presidential campaign. On some of his campaign stops, the voices of the people are louder than his. They demand youth employment, relief for indebted farmers and an end to corruption. Moussa carries on amid a cacophony of fireworks, horns, loudspeakers and the distinct roar of the crowd. And hopes that it will pay off at the polls. CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from Beheira province, Egypt, and Moni Basu reported from Atlanta.","Amre Moussa has had a long diplomatic career .

"London, England (CNN) -- The British Ministry of Defence Wednesday named the five troops who were killed in Afghanistan in a shooting blamed on a ""rogue"" Afghan policeman. They were Warrant Officer 1st Class Darren Chant, Sgt. Matthew Telford, and Guardsman James Major, all of the 1st Battalion The Grenadier Guards, and Royal Military Policemen Acting Cpl. Steven Boote and Cpl. Nicholas Webster-Smith, the ministry said Wednesday. The men were killed in an attack in Afghanistan's southern Helmand province, the British Ministry of Defence said earlier in the day. The attack happened Tuesday afternoon in the Nad-e'Ali District of Helmand, the ministry said. All the soldiers died from gunshot wounds sustained in the attack. Initial reports show that it was an Afghan national policeman who initiated the fire on the soldiers, a ministry spokesman told CNN. ""I don't think that this is the example of a broader picture, but this could be an example of corruption ... or somebody might have been paid, somebody might have had connections,"" former Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah told Sky News about the reports. ""These are the things you cannot take care of (individually). This has to be taken care of by those who are in charge of the police force,"" he added. Lt. Col. David Wakefield, a spokesman for Task Force Helmand, expressed his ""deepest sadness"" at the deaths. ""Five British soldiers, five of our own, shot down in the course of their duty. They will not be forgotten,"" Wakefield said. British Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth also expressed his sadness and condolences, as did British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. ""The death of five brave soldiers in a single incident is a terrible loss,"" Brown said in a statement. ""My thoughts, condolences and sympathies go to their families, loved ones and colleagues.

"Simferopol, Ukraine (CNN) -- There has been lots of talk by officials about Ukraine, specifically about the disputed region of Crimea and it possibly joining Russia. There have been threats of sanctions and other punitive measures against Moscow, for allegedly supporting this breakaway from Ukraine, in spirit and in action. Troops -- some uniformed, some not -- have been seen in and around the region, raising worries, even if no one has been shot. But could something big and decisive be coming soon? For as tense as things are now, the fear is that things could deteriorate quickly and bloodily. The trigger may be Sunday's vote in Crimea, where voters can formally set the stage for its secession from Ukraine and becoming part of Russia. Russia's increased flexing of its military might has heightened the tensions and raised fears of an imminent invasion, especially after the referendum results come in and the dominoes start falling. Thousands of Russian paratroopers, artillerymen and more on Friday continued a large-scale military drill near the Ukraine border. On the same day, armored truck after truck toting long-range guns and other military equipment rumbled through northern Crimea. Already, eight Ukrainian military units in Crimea have been taken over, 22 others are blocked, and 49 of 56 border patrol stations are in similar straits, Ukraine's foreign ministry said. Kiev's new Western-leaning government -- which came to power following the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled last month after succumbing to intense public pressure in part for aligning more with Moscow and less with the European Union -- has insisted that Ukraine's territorial integrity, including Crimea, must be respected. Moscow has been equally steadfast in its support for ethnic Russians and abiding by voter's' wishes in Crimea. Estonia's defense minister, Urmas Reinsalu, warned Friday that Ukraine is on the verge of a full-scale military conflict unless Russian President Vladimir Putin's hand is forced. ""It is clear that we are at a crossroads,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Friday. ""If positions continue to harden and rhetoric continues to sharpen, there is great risk of a dangerous downward spiral."" Neither side is budging. Russia so far has refused any direct talks with Ukraine's new leaders, but its foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, has talked daily with Kerry, met face-to-face with him last week in Europe and the diplomats met again for more than five hours Friday in London. Afterward, it appeared -- as has been the case for weeks -- the only thing Russia and the United States agree upon is that they can't agree on anything of substance. As Lavrov said Friday, ""We don't have a common vision."" Kerry: Actions 'calibrated' if Russia open to talks . While the Russian foreign minister and his team did engage in talks Friday, calling them negotiations may be a reach. As Kerry said, Moscow wasn't going to do anything until the Crimea referendum's results are released, likely Monday. In fact, Lavrov didn't have any authority to even negotiate on anything to do with Crimea, according to a senior State Department official. His boss, Putin, reiterated Friday that Sunday's vote is in line with international law and the U.N. charter, a Kremlin statement said. A day earlier, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin asked why Crimeans don't deserve a right to self-determination, just like anyone else. Ukraine's new government, as well as Western leaders, see it differently. While Churkin accused the West of having ""fanned the flames of unrest,"" officials there accuse Russia of instigating and furthering the crisis -- including sending troops into Crimea to blockade and seize Ukrainian military and other facilities, something Moscow has denied. European nations and the United States have already hit back some, with targeted punishments in addition to offers of billions in aid to Ukraine's fledgling government. The situation seems to have had an impact already within Russia, as evidenced by steep declines in its stock market and the value of the ruble. And the State Department cautioned Americans about traveling to Russia given ""the possibility of violence or anti-U.S. actions directed against U.S. citizens or U.S. interests."" Kerry warned Friday that the ""consequences"" will be far more stringent should Putin sign off on the ""back-door annexation"" of Crimea. At the same time, he opened the door for less strident measures should Russia opt not to take in Crimea -- whatever the referendum says -- and instead go along with more autonomy, human rights monitoring and other steps for that region if it stays part of Ukraine. ""If there is greater diplomatic opportunity that can be pursued -- and that is, in fact, on the table -- then I'm confident that whatever the response is would be calibrated accordingly,"" Kerry said. ""But if ... a decision is made that is negative and/or flies in the face of all of the rationale that the EU and others have put on the table for the illegality (of an annexation), that will obviously demand some further response."" For his part, Lavrov called Friday's conversations -- which he characterized as ""negotiations"" -- as ""useful,"" even if they didn't produce a breakthrough. He added he's aware of what might happen if Crimea becomes part of Russia, saying sanctions won't help anyone. ""I assure you that our partners understand that sanctions are counterproductive ... and (they) will not facilitate mutual interests,"" he said. Unrest, military action continues . Some 1,500 miles away from these seemingly calm, cordial discussions, Crimea continues to boil. Col. Evgeniy Pivovarov, the head of a military hospital associated with Ukraine's foreign ministry, was ""kidnapped"" Friday evening in the Crimean capital of Simferopol, a Ukrainian defense ministry spokesman for Crimea said. ""His kidnappers cuffed Pivovarov's hands behind his back and drove him away,"" said Vladislav Seleznev. ""His whereabouts are currently unknown."" Meanwhile, in northern Crimea, video shot by CNN showed green trucks rolling in the direction of Dzhankoy, home to a key military airfield. They appeared loaded, including some with long-range artillery guns. Who was driving them, and for what purpose? One of the vehicles had a Russian license plate, but the other had no plates at all. And men connected to the convoy refused to answer CNN's questions on the matter. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly claimed that Russian troops are among the armed men that have, effectively, taken over Crimea on the heels of the local government's decision to side with Moscow and against Kiev. Russia has denied any direct involvement, saying what's happening in Crimea is an internal matter. The powerful nation hasn't been shy, however, about military activities on its side of the border with Ukraine. Its defense ministry has said about 8,500 artillery personnel were staging snap military exercises not far from Ukraine's eastern border. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power estimated ""at least 10,000"" Russian troops overall were involved. ""This is the second time inside of a month that Russia has chosen to mass large amounts of force on short notice without much transparency around the eastern borders of Ukraine,"" a senior State Department official said. Meanwhile, six Russian jet fighters were moved to Bobruisk airfield in Belarus on Thursday, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti cited the Belarussian Defense Ministry as saying Friday. The move is part of Belarus' offer to Russia to participate in joint military drills, the news agency reported. Belarus, a former Soviet republic, borders Russia and northern Ukraine. Russia's defense ministry released video Friday showing paratroopers floating downward as part of those drills. Should Moscow launch a full-fledged invasion of at least Crimea, they should prevail, said Ruslan Pukhov, the director of CAST, or the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, in Moscow. Russia has more than four times the amount of troops as Ukraine, not to mention exponentially more tanks, armored personnel carriers and ships. ""There is no fortification. There is no military infrastructure,"" Pukhov said. ""That is why I think it would be quite easy and quick.""

"(CNN) -- When 81-year old Cecilia Gimenez took it upon herself to restore a flaking century-old fresco of Jesus on her local church's wall in Spain last year, she was treated to an international lambasting like only the Internet makes possible. Her work, which would have looked more at home on a proud parent's fridge door than on a house of worship, spawned memes, merchandise and even a Pinterest board of alternative ""restorations."" But things have taken a turn for the better, with the ""Monkey Jesus"" depiction, as it has become known, drawing tourists to the town of Borja in the thousands. The church, which started charging people to see the mural, has raised â‚¬50,000 ($72,500) for a local charity from 70,000 visitors, according to local news site Heraldo.es (Spanish only). Local restaurant and bar owners say business is booming and there are plans to produce official lines of merchandise including plates, postcards and cigarette lighters, with the proceeds split between Gimenez and the local council. Gimenez, who has sold artwork on eBay, even opened her own art exhibition in Borja this week, displaying pieces that suggest she is not totally devoid of talent.

"(CNN) -- As Egyptians prepare for their milestone presidential election this week, thousands of activist youths who spearheaded the revolution -- the very ones who made the election possible -- will not be casting a vote. Instead, they are in prison, facing military trials. On May 4, more than 350 protesters, including 16 women and 10 children, were arrested near Defense Ministry in the Abbaseya neighborhood of Cairo, adding to the approximately 12,000 political prisoners detained since the Revolution. The Abbaseya protesters fortunate enough to be released from detention have revealed horrific stories of torture and abuse at the hands of military officers. Interrogators hurled abusive insults at them and said sarcastically that any future president would be working under the orders of the ruling military council, better known as the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. Their accounts dash any illusions that the lead-up to the election, complete with formal televised debates and countless informal discussions on the streets, represents a new era of freedom in Egypt. On multiple occasions since March 2011, the military police have tortured and abused protesters, according to a recent report from Human Rights Watch. Despite repeated promises to investigate, Egypt's ruling military council has shown little action and no one has been held accountable. The girls who were imprisoned for protesting on May 4 heard screams of their fellow protesters being beaten and tortured in cells above them. One girl who has made public statements after being released was too shaken to bring herself to describe what happened to her and other girls. Of the 15 boys released in early May -- because they had student identification cards -- one of them, 24-year-old Halim Hanish, summoned the courage to recount his ordeal: ""They beat us with long sticks on our backs and legs for hours; some went unconscious and were never given any medical care and disappeared later. I was threatened with sexual assault with a foreign object ..."" The ostensible reason behind the release of the 15 students was the timing of their final exams. But the young men were far too traumatized by what they suffered to take their exams. Some have remained silent, fearing the retribution of speaking out. In a society where men value macho pride and unmarried women value virginity, it is courageous for young men and women who have been abused to go public about the torture and sexual violence that occur regularly to those who are held in detention. Moreover, some of the parents are also not afraid to speak out. The father of Ahmed Taha, a 17-year-old student who was arrested on allegations of violence, spoke out about his son's detention and rape by an officer in the High Court building on October 28. Ahmed was attending the funeral of fellow protester, Essam Ata, when he got detained. Despite being under age and having endured such brutality, Ahmed remains in detention and has been denied access to medical attention or legal council. The ruling military council's widespread use of detention and trial appears unprecedented, even when measured against the time of Hosni Mubarak. The addition of abuse and torture all adds up to a zero-sum strategy of squashing dissent and consolidating power. By trapping civilian protesters inside the military system, the ruling military council completes the cycle of intimidation against Egyptian citizens. According to Tamer Baza, a lawyer for protesters, detainees do not file formal complaints about the beatings and tortures to the judges (all of whom are military judges) for fear of further detention as retribution.The halcyon days of the revolution when Egyptian activists proclaimed ""the army and the people are one hand"" are but a distant memory as the ruling military council drives an unprecedented wedge between the military and civilians, particularly the revolutionary youth. One doctor, who was arrested after she had treated protesters, overheard military officers inciting soldiers against the protesters: ""I could hear the officers saying to the soldiers, 'These are the people who killed hundreds of soldiers.' So now Egyptian soldiers are made to feel that civilians are there to attack them, that we are the enemy, and they congratulate themselves for arresting us."" How is it possible that the United States granted a human rights waiver to the ruling military council government that has instituted these brutal practices? With the misguided calculation that the ruling military council can ensure ""stability,"" the U.S. government has sacrificed its own credibility as a defender of human rights. As more human rights violations come to light, the U.S. government should change its policy and hold the government accountable, rescind the waiver and condition military aid. When Egyptians go to the polls on Wednesday for the first genuine election in their lifetimes -- a great milestone -- the voices of the ""magnificent youth"" who ""woke Egyptians from the dead"" and have fought to keep the ideals of the revolution alive should not be forgotten as they continue to be locked up in prison. Let's hope that one of the first acts of the new Egyptian president will be to uphold justice by releasing all the innocent political prisoners who are under detention. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cynthia Schneider and Khaled Abol Naga.","On the eve of Egypt's presidential elections, protesters clashed with the military .

"Dushanbe, Tajikistan (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thanked Tajikistan's president Saturday for his country's support of efforts to defeat al-Qaeda and bring security to neighboring Afghanistan. Clinton later flew to Uzbekistan, where she discussed Afghanistan, human rights and economic ties. In her first visit to the central Asian country of Tajikistan, she also addressed concerns about human rights and the need to bring more economic opportunities during a town hall meeting earlier in the day. Clinton and President Emomali Rahmon ""talked about our work to improve Tajikistan's security, particularly along the border with Afghanistan, and to combat drug trafficking,"" Clinton told reporters Saturday. She praised Tajikistan's progress in stopping human traffickers who force women and children to work in cotton fields without pay. But Clinton said the country still faces important challenges. ""Tajik citizens deserve the opportunity to receive a decent education, own land, practice whatever religion they choose, enjoy a free and independent media, and participate equally in the political process,"" Clinton said at the town hall meeting, sponsored by the Aga Khan Development Network. ""And it is up to their leaders to ensure that fundamental freedoms, including religious freedom, are protected for all people: men and women, young and old."" Several reporters have been arrested in Tajikistan for reporting on corruption or the arrests of religious activists, a senior U.S. State Department official said. Clinton also said the barriers to increased trade are significant, ""but so is the potential."" ""That is why the United States supports what we're calling the New Silk Road: a network of transit and trade connections that will open new markets for raw materials, energy, and agricultural products for every nation in the region, including Tajikistan,"" she said. Tajikistan is one of the poorest countries in the region and was embroiled in civil war until 1997. It shares a 1,400-kilometer border with Afghanistan, ""large parts of which are quite porous,"" making the country vulnerable to extremists, a senior state department official said. ""The New Silk Road holds the potential to help spur growth, create jobs, invigorate the private sector, and integrate Tajikistan into the South and Central Asia economy,"" Clinton said. ""It would also help bring stability to your neighbors in Afghanistan by expanding their economic ties throughout the region."" Clinton said the United States is working with the Aga Khan Development Network to support Pamir Energy in building an integrated energy grid along the Tajik-Afghan border. Pamir Energy is a cross-border electricity transmission project that is helping to light up two very remote provinces of Afghanistan and Tajikistan, the State Department said. Later, in Uzbekistan, President Islam Karimov expressed support for the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, a senior U.S. State Department official told reporters. Clinton told Karimov that improvements were needed in the area of human rights, the official said. ""President Karimov commented that he wants to make progress on liberalization and democratization, and he said that he wants to leave a legacy of that for his -- both his kids and his grandchildren,"" the official said. They also discussed Clinton's planned visit to a General Motors plant and Uzbekistan's desire for more U.S. investment and technology.","NEW: Clinton talks with the president of Uzbekistan about human rights .

"(CNN) -- Time to scream for Beatlemania again. Apple Corps, the Beatles' business organization, and director Ron Howard are teaming up for a documentary on the Fab Four's touring years, according to a statement released by the principals. The film will chronicle the rise of Beatlemania, which coincided with the group's relentless touring of England, continental Europe, North America and parts of Asia from 1964 to 1966 -- a punishing schedule of frantic audiences, challenging security and occasional political difficulties that eventually prompted the group to withdraw to the studio, with small exceptions, until its 1970 breakup. Among the group's trailblazing concerts were the New York Shea Stadium shows in 1965 and 1966, a performance at Tokyo's Nippon Budokan in 1966 and a show at San Francisco's Candlestick Park in 1966 -- the group's final American concert. The tours weren't without problems. On a 1966 stop in the Philippines, the Beatles skipped an invitation to a breakfast hosted by first lady Imelda Marcos and were accused of snubbing her. In response, the group's police protection was pulled and the group's entourage was attacked at the airport. Later that year, while touring America, John Lennon's comments about the group being ""more popular than Jesus"" set off record burnings and protests in some cities. ""The way the Beatles burst onto the scene in Britain was an overwhelming social, cultural and musical phenomenon, but was even then eclipsed by that extraordinary explosion on the American scene and then the world,"" said producer Nigel Sinclair of White Horse Pictures, which is co-producing the film, in the statement. Sinclair's credits include the documentary ""George Harrison: Living in the Material World."" The production team also includes Imagine Entertainment, Howard's producing shingle.

"(CNN) -- Over the past two years, 12 Americans have been charged with supporting militant groups fighting in Syria or have died while fighting with such groups. Who are they? Of the dozen Americans drawn to fight with ISIS or the al Qaeda affiliated Nusra Front, a profile does appear to be emerging: They are young, typically high school graduates and college students, who are self-recruited online by what they view as exciting video propaganda pouring out of ISIS and Nusra, and they seek to reach the Syrian battlefields by traveling via Turkey. The dozen Americans are a rainbow of ethnicities; of South Asian, East Asian, Caucasian, Middle Eastern and African-American descent, according to a survey by New America. For example, Sinh Vinh Ngo Nguyen, a 24-year-old man of Vietnamese descent from California, pleaded guilty last year to attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization. In the plea agreement, he admitted that he had fought in Syria. None of the dozen appears to be of Syrian descent. This is in contrast to the some 30 Americans who were drawn to fight in Somalia from 2007 onward alongside the al Qaeda affiliated Al-Shabaab group. They were largely of Somali descent and were overwhelmingly from Minnesota, where there is a large Somali-American population. The 12 American militants drawn to the Syrian conflict come from a wide range of states: California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina and Texas. They are also generally young with an average age of 24. Three teenagers are among those charged: . -- Shannon Conley, a 19-year old California woman pleaded guilty last month to attempting to join ISIS. -- Mohammed Hamza Khan, a 19-year-old Illinois man arrested this month, allegedly sought to join ISIS. He is awaiting trial. -- Abdella Tounisi from Chicago was 18 when he was charged last year with seeking to support Nusra in Syria. He is on trial. The Americans seeking to fight in Syria are not a particularly educated group. For the nine of the 12 individuals for whom educational attainment is known, none graduated from college. Perhaps critically, all but two of the 12 were active on jihadi social media. ISIS in particular has made a determined effort to recruit Western fighters over social media, for example releasing a 55-minute English language propaganda and recruitment video on Twitter last month. The heavy social media use of individuals traveling to Syria is something of a boon for American security services. The social media use of Douglas McCain, a 33-year-old man from Minnesota, who died fighting with ISIS in August, reportedly landed him on a terrorist watch list and helped the United States track him. Once individuals are radicalized and are convinced to join ISIS or Nusra, they often decide to travel to Syria through Turkey. -- Moner Abu Salha, a 22-year-old from Florida, explained how he traveled to Turkey and met up with jihadist facilitators there in a propaganda video that was released in August after he died conducting a suicide bombing in Syria. -- Douglas McCain also traveled through Turkey earlier this year. -- Adam Dandach, a 20-year-old from Orange County, California, was arrested in July for passport fraud en route to Turkey allegedly to join ISIS. He is on trial. -- Mohammed Hamza Khan purchased tickets to travel to Turkey via Austria according to the complaint filed in his case. The importance of the Turkish route into Syria likely provides the key to reduce the number of Americans traveling to fight in Syria. For example, look at the case of Donald Morgan, a 44-year-old from North Carolina, who sought to travel to fight in Syria but has not been charged with a terrorism-related crime. He was turned back at Istanbul Airport by Turkish authorities this summer. There are reports that Turkey may be stepping up its efforts to close the routes that allow foreigners to reach the Syrian conflict and join jihadist groups. We can only hope that is the case. U.S. law enforcement has also made a determined effort to track Americans engaged in the Syrian conflict. Seven of the 12 individuals charged in the past two years were monitored closely by an FBI informant. Even in the case of Moner Abu Salha, who returned from training in Syria to the States in May 2013, a tip to the FBI from a friend he tried to recruit when he was back in the States placed him on the FBI's radar. Still there are limits to that tracking. FBI Director James Comey was asked by the CBS show ""60 Minutes"" earlier this month whether he knew the identity of the dozen or so Americans believed to be fighting in Syria. Comey said, ""I think of that, dozen or so, I do. I hesitate only because I don't know what I don't know.""","12 Americans have been charged with supporting militant groups in Syria or have died there .

"(CNN) -- The Pentagon must hold down its spending and make choices that will anger ""powerful people"" in an era of economic strain, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a weekend speech in Kansas. Increasing health care costs, a top-heavy uniformed and civilian management force, and big-ticket weapons systems are swelling the military's budget at an ""unsustainable"" rate, Gates said. In response, Gates said, he has ordered the Defense Department's military and civilian leaders to find savings of 2 to 3 percent -- more than $10 billion of the Pentagon's roughly $550 billion base budget -- and shift spending toward war-fighting costs. ""These savings must stem from root-and-branch changes that can be sustained and added to over time,"" he told an audience Saturday at the Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene. ""Simply taking a few percent off the top of everything on a onetime basis will not do."" On his way out of office in 1961, President Eisenhower -- the former general who led allied forces in Europe during World War II -- warned of the expanding influence of what he called the ""military-industrial complex."" Nearly 50 years later, Gates invoked that history to warn that the cuts on the way ""will displease powerful people, both inside the Pentagon and out."" The U.S. defense budget has more than doubled since the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Since taking office in 2006, Gates has managed to cut some of the Pentagon's major weapons systems, but efforts to kill other programs have been defeated under heavy pressure from military contractors and members of Congress. ""Given America's difficult economic circumstances and parlous fiscal condition, military spending on things large and small can and should expect closer, harsher scrutiny,"" he said. ""The gusher has been turned off, and will stay off for a good period of time."" Retired Army Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, a former U.S. military spokesman in Iraq, told CNN that Gates is trying to preserve U.S. combat power in the face of increasing costs. ""He sees the political winds and recognizes he will not be able to get the budgets that he needs,"" Kimmitt told CNN. ""What he wants to do is protect the muscle. By cutting away at some of the fat, he can keep the money necessary to keep the constantly increasing budget to maintain a strong and ready force."" Gates acknowledged that many of his predecessors have tried and failed to do the same thing. But he said the U.S. force structure should be reviewed in ""the wider, real-world context"" and was probably out of scale to existing threats. ""For example, should we really be up in arms over a temporary projected shortfall of about 100 Navy and Marine strike fighters relative to the number of carrier wings, when America's military possesses more than 3,200 tactical combat aircraft of all kinds?"" Gates asked. ""Does the number of warships we have and are building really put America at risk when the U.S. battle fleet is larger than the next 13 navies combined, 11 of which belong to allies and partners? Is it a dire threat that by 2020 the United States will have only 20 times more advanced stealth fighters than China?"" Gates said defense spending was roughly twice the share of the U.S. economy in Eisenhower's day -- ""but today, we face a very different set of American economic and fiscal realities."" ""As a matter of principle and political reality, the Department of Defense cannot go to America's elected representatives and ask for increases each year unless we have done everything possible to make every dollar count,"" he said.","Gates says he's ordered officials to find savings of 2 to 3 percent in Pentagon budget .

"(CNN) -- West Virginia's attorney general and state legislators announced Tuesday that they'd join those investigating a chemical spill that left hundreds of thousands scrambling for safe water, with one senator promising ""there will definitely be a change."" ""This whole series of events is unacceptable,"" said Senate Majority Leader John Unger, who will be leading the state legislative probe, echoing many others around West Virginia and elsewhere since the crisis boiled up last Thursday. These latest investigations came out the same day that a few thousand more West Virginians were told they could use their tap water again, for the first time in nearly a week. Still, nearly two-thirds of the nearly 300,000 people initially prohibited from using their taps still are waiting for the all-clear. Their headaches and heartaches trace to the leak of several thousand gallons of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol -- a substance used in the coal industry -- from a storage tank belonging to a company called Freedom Industries. That chemical made its way into the Elk River, to a water plant about a mile upstream, then into the water system. Residents of nine counties -- including the one that is home to Charleston, West Virginia's capital and most populated city -- were urged last week not to use their tap water to do anything except flush their toilets. With its strong odor as the telltale sign, officials warned that they couldn't say that the water so many rely on to drink, cook using or wash themselves with was safe. Authorities worked to flush the foul-smelling chemical from the area water system, all while conducting tests that eventually showed it declining. Chemical spill shines spotlight on loose regulation . But it has been only recently some have been told they can use their water, such as the lifting of the ""do not use"" order Tuesday morning for the Southridge/Southside area near Charleston. By Tuesday evening, about 114,000 people were advised it was safe for them to run their taps again -- with more than 180,000 remaining in limbo. And it's not just individual citizens in their homes who have been affected. Without safe water, schools and many businesses such as hotels, restaurants and more decided to close. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's office said schools would remain closed in four counties Wednesday, leaving about 46,000 students at leisure. Amid this widespread pain, a number of local, state and federal authorities have announced they're launching investigations intent on getting to the bottom of what happened and holding people, agencies and companies responsible for the spill and possible issues in the response. Investigators from the Kanawha County Fire Department and the state Department of Environmental Protection were among the first at the scene. By the next day, U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin announced that his office was also looking into what happened, telling CNN that ""even a negligent release of this kind could be a criminal violation."" Also on the federal side, Environmental Protection Agency investigators went to the scene as did a team from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board. Plus, two U.S. congressmen -- Reps. Henry A. Waxman and Paul D. Tonko, Democrats from California and New York respectively -- said in a letter Monday they believe the spill may have exposed regulatory gaps in the country's chemical control laws. Two new authorities in the state of West Virginia on Tuesday announced their own investigations. Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that his office plans ""to get to the bottom of this and ensure that the public knows the truth"" -- including what happened, why and how might it have been prevented. ""We need to make sure this never happens again, and that responsible parties are held accountable,"" Morrisey said of his office's ""unbiased, independent inquiry."" And Unger, the Democratic state senator from Berkeley, said the Joint Legislative Oversight Commission on State Water Resources -- which he co-chairs -- is also digging into the ""unacceptable"" ordeal. Among other things, that legislative body will look into who knew what and when, ""and if no one knew, why not."" ""There will definitely be a change to the way things have been done in the past,"" Unger said. And it's not just West Virginians who are affected. The Greater Cincinnati Water Works, which serves that Ohio city and parts of four counties in Ohio and Kentucky, will temporarily stop taking water from the Ohio River as a precaution, allowing water that might contain traces of the chemical to pass the city, company spokeswoman Michele Ralston said Tuesday. Two Kentucky water systems -- in Ashland and Russell -- temporarily turned off their valve systems, Dick Brown, a spokesman for the Department for Environmental Protection, told CNN. The move was strictly a precaution since the Elk River is a tributary to the Kanawha, which feeds into the Ohio River. The Cincinnati utility is sampling the Ohio River water and so far hasn't detected anything out of the ordinary, Ralston said. The move will not disrupt customers' water supplies because the company has a two-day reserve and a groundwater plant that can provide even more treated water, she said. Opinion: It's OK, the water's safe to flush . CNN's Matt Smith, Michael Pearson, Jason Hanna, Alina Machado and Meridith Edwards contributed to this report.","NEW: More people are told they can use water; more than 180,000 still under ""do not use"" order .

"(CNN) -- They are here practically every day. Anti-abortion protesters set up their signs outside the Jackson Women's Health Organization and regularly preach their beliefs to anyone who will listen. They pray the clinic will close. Their prayers may soon be answered. Clinic owners are in a fight to save the only abortion clinic operating in the state of Mississippi. New state requirements may close their doors forever, making Mississippi the first abortion-free state. ""I want to say over my dead body, but I'm afraid,"" said clinic owner and president Diane Derzis. ""We're going to do whatever it takes to keep servicing the women of Mississippi,"" she said. A state law that takes effect Sunday requires all of a clinic's abortion providers to be certified OB/GYN's, and all of them must have privileges at a local hospital.

That's the intent. And what happens afterwards, we'll have to see what happens,"" he told CNN. Mississippi has been one of the toughest states on the abortion rights movement. The state already has laws requiring a 24-hour waiting period, as well as parental consent if the patient seeking an abortion is a minor. ""All of that is wrapped in that cloak of conservative religion,"" said W. Martin Wiseman, director of the Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University. ""You'll find very few legislators, regardless of whether they are white, black, Democrat or Republican who will say, 'I'm pro-abortion,'"" Wiseman said. Gov. Phil Bryant signed the bill with the new requirements into law in April after the Republican-dominated legislature overwhelmingly passed it. ""It's historic. Today you see the first step in a movement, I believe, to do what we campaigned on -- to say that we're going to try to end abortion in Mississippi,"" Bryant said at the bill-signing event. Bryant signs bill tightening restrictions on abortion providers . The clinic says it is trying to comply. All of its doctors are OB/GYNs who travel in from other states. But only one can practice at a local hospital. The new law states that all doctors in a clinic must have hospital privileges. Officials at the Jackson clinic say they're trying to gain privileges at Jackson-area hospitals but that the cumbersome process and red tape has forced them to file suit. They've gone to federal court to try to get an injunction that would allow them to stay open while they fight the new law. The court has not yet ruled on their motion. The Mississippi Department of Health says it will inspect the clinic on Monday for compliance. If the clinic cannot meet the new state law requirements, then it will have the right to appeal and begin an administrative process that could take several months. But, Derzis says, employees would be subject to arrest and fines of up to $2,000 a day if the clinic stays open. So, it would essentially be forced to close. ""It's an absolute tragedy,"" Derzis said. ""No one wants to talk about abortion. No one wants to think about abortion until they're there,"" she said. ""There are three reasons you have an abortion: Rape, incest and 'mine.' I hear that all the time: 'You know, I don't believe in abortion, but, now it's my kid,'"" she told CNN's George Howell. Mississippi voters reject anti-abortion initiative . But the law's sponsor says the law is about having the proper license to operate, and if that law closes the only abortion clinic in the state, then so be it. ""I'm very pro-life, Mims said. ""I believe life begins at conception. And I think a lot of Mississippians do, as well. If this legislation causes less abortions, then that's a good thing."" Derzis believes that this was the real intent of the newly elected Republican majority -- to end abortion in the state, not to improve women's health care. ""I love that it's white, old men, making those statements,"" she said. ""We've been able to be with women at a time in their lives where they are in crisis, when they need to have something done and need that support. That's why it has to be available. It has to be,"" she said. ""This is not about safety. This is about politics. Politics do not need to be in our uterus.""","State law that goes into effect Sunday could close Mississippi's only abortion clinic .

"(CNN) -- Say hello to the new Captain. In the first issue of Marvel's ""All-New Captain America,"" in stores today, onetime sidekick Sam Wilson sheds his Falcon persona and picks up the Captain's patriotic shield. Sam replaces Steve Rogers, who begins to age rapidly after losing a battle (he came from the World War II era, after all.) With a woman taking over the role of Thor, an African-American Captain America is yet another example of the diversity trend in comic books. CNN recently spoke to writer Rick Remender on what to expect with this big change. CNN: What led to this decision to hand over the role of Captain America? Rick Remender: I had been writing Steve Rogers for a little bit; he's this kid raised in the Great Depression, and I wanted to explore that. That story has been the status quo of Captain America since the 1960s. As I was developing the series, I fell more in love with Sam Wilson as a character and realized that in Marvel continuity time, he would be a Generation X-er, as am I. He'd have a more modern sensibility and be able to speak to an audience the way Steve Rogers wouldn't be able to, so we started building the story from there. CNN: How will Sam handle things differently than Steve? Remender: The two characters both come from a tumultuous, difficult place. But Sam is somebody who isn't reflecting on things as a soldier. He wants to stand up and put himself between the forces of evil and corruption and things that would harm the everyday citizen. Sam will not be working as closely with S.H.I.E.L.D. as Steve (spoiler alert!). Ultimately, the way they approach problems will be quite different. CNN: What will Steve's role be now? Remender: Steve Rogers -- who has aged now; time has caught up to him -- will still be a tactician, providing his military experience. Steve is almost an eye in the sky. Since he is incapable of serving as Captain America, he will be at the Avengers mansion at the command station. Beyond that, he'll be a military strategist, the one thing that Sam really isn't. CNN: What have you heard from fans? Remender: The feedback's been great! Obviously, there's been a few ugly comments and people who have taken offense to the change for various reasons. But that's been the challenge of the modern era, to ignore the hate online and to focus on the positivity. One of the things we got were photos of kids holding the shield. We got a photo from a predominantly African-American classroom, where the kids were jumping up and down with joy with the image of Sam behind them. Culturally, that's something that is significant. If it helps one kid feel a part of something and makes them feel that they are reflected in their heroes ... that's a wonderful byproduct that will hopefully have more positive effects than just being an exciting superhero comic. CNN: Will Sam meet up with other characters, like the new Thor? Remender: Jason Aaron -- who is the writer of ""Thor"" -- he and I have been cooking up some potential crossovers for the two books, along with appearing in ""Avengers"" stories. CNN: How long will this last? Remender: When I proposed it originally, it was seen as ""You can't do it unless it's going to be a long-term change."" Depending on how well I do my job and people's reaction, this could be a permanent change or something that goes on for a good long while. CNN: What can fans expect in upcoming issues? Remender: I wanted to put Sam into something that felt like a traditional ""Captain America"" comic book but wanted him to come up against an insurmountable wall unlike anything Steve has even faced. This is basically the rise of Hydra in the Marvel universe, in a way we've never seen a terrorist organization rise before. Under the watch of Baron Zemo and Chancellor Cassandra, they're moving forward with some big James Bond-ian evil plans. Hydra has already won before Sam realizes that they're up to something. We put him up against a huge wall that's going to have giant ramifications for the entire Marvel universe. That has implications we can appreciate in the world we're living in today.","Captain America's onetime sidekick Sam Wilson debuts as the new Captain .

"(CNN) -- When charity and creativity go hand in hand, the result can be a work of art -- quite literally. Such is the aim of Syri-Arts, part of Lebanese non-profit organization Kayany, which is working to raise much needed money for Syrian refugee children by auctioning off 150 works of art. For Nora Joumblatt, an art historian who is helping to spearhead the endeavor, the initiative makes perfect sense. ""The Mideast is home to a host of artistic talent and art is the universal language,"" she says. An online auction, hosted by website Paddle8.com, began October 30. A live auction, hosted by Sotheby's, will be held at 6pm on November 8 at the Beirut Exhibition Center, where the art is on display. According to Syri-Arts, all the funds raised ""will go to the benefit of Syrian refugee children to secure food, clothing, medication and schooling through reputable NGOs working on the ground."" ""They are all donations,"" proudly declares Wassim Rasamny, one of the organizers, about the works of art being sold. ""We have 150 artists stretching from North Africa to the Arabian Gulf ... who have so passionately donated their works."" Contributors include artists from Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Morocco, and many other countries. While the organizing committee expected, and depended upon, generosity of spirit, they were still surprised by the outpouring. ""We thought maybe we'd get 40 or 50 artists contributing,"" says Joumblatt. ""We didn't expect this overwhelming response. This really shows how civil society is keen to help Syrian children."" According to Syri-Arts, ""the international community has failed in its collective responsibility towards the Syrian child. The children deserve immediate action to help alleviate the daily hardships they are facing in this colossal tragedy."" According to the UN, at least 1 million of the over 2 million registered Syrian refugees are children. ""That is a staggering number,"" explains Joumblatt, who calls it ""the tragedy of the 20th century."" Children are facing ""catastrophic consequences"" because of the escalating violence in Syria, according to UNICEF, which adds that ""more than 4 million children are now affected by the brutal conflict."" Just recently the World Health Organization confirmed ten cases of polio among children in Syria, the first outbreak of the disease in the country since 1999. ""I don't think the international community realizes the state the Syrian children are in,"" says Joumblatt. ""The threats of child labor or early marriage or trafficking ... I don't think the international community realizes that even their minimum needs aren't being met."" Joumblatt says the cause is important to her not just because she was born in Syria, but also because she was exiled from there as a child. ""This is a huge problem. And this is a whole generation Syria is at risk of losing,"" says Joumblatt. Syri-Arts Beirut is organized in collaboration with the Lebanese Ministry of Social Affairs, UNICEF, Save The Children International, Action Against Hunger, Syri-Art Paris, Institut du Monde Arabe (IMA), and the Beirut Exhibition Center.","Artists from across Mideast have donated piece for one-off public auction .

"(CNN) -- For the Dawsons of Tauranga, New Zealand, the canoe slalom event at the London Olympics will be a family affair. Mike Dawson, who is competing in the men's kayak class, will not just be trying to impress his father, who coaches him, or his brother and sister, who will be watching from the crowd. He will also need to ensure he doesn't incur the disapproval of his mother, Kay, who is one of the judges at the event. The idea of a mother officiating in a competition in which her son is participating may strike some as a little unfair, but the Dawsons and the New Zealand Canoe Federation are eager to stress there's no scope for special treatment in this case. ""The only real advantage mum can give me is her presence at what will be my biggest race ever,"" said Mike Dawson, who is competing in the Olympics for the first time after finishing 16th in the canoe slalom world championships in Slovakia last year. The event involves the kayakers flinging themselves down a steep course of white-water rapids, weaving through a series of gates like slalom skiers in a race against the clock. If the competitors touch or miss a gate, they suffer a time penalty. Each gate has a judge watching out for errors, and a chief official oversees the entire course. As one of the gate judges, Kay Dawson has an important role, but her decisions will be scrutinized by other officials -- each gate judge also monitors the two gates on either side. Competitors' runs are reviewed on video, and the chief official has the final say. ""I can't envisage any way a single gate judge could influence the outcome for any athlete,"" said Maree Burnett, the secretary general of the New Zealand Canoe Federation. ""Kay is a very experienced international judge."" The International Canoe Federation, which selected her as the only judge from New Zealand for the Olympic event, agrees. In the past few years, Kay Dawson has officiated at canoe slalom world championships and world cups in which her 25-year-old son has raced. The ICF has ""a strong officiating process in place to ensure accuracy and fairness at all its competitions, whether it is at world cups, world championships or at the Olympic Games,"" said Lerina Bright, a spokeswoman for the federation. She noted that some judges at the event have the same nationality as some competitors. ""That could equally be thought to create a conflict of interest,"" she said. ""However, the judging process is thorough and stringent and does not provide any possibility for a single individual to affect the outcome of a competitor's run."" Despite the multitude of officials at the canoe slalom event, the role of individual judges is still significant, Kay Dawson has said. ""When officiating the athlete and 100% accuracy is always the focus, one poor call can mean the difference between a top-10 finish and chance of a medal or being out of the competition,"" she wrote in an article on the New Zealand federation's website in February. Relationships with family and friends don't enter the equation, though, she says. ""I've been officiating for a number of years now and know a lot of the athletes, so it is easy to put aside any personal emotions when I'm on the course,"" Kay Dawson said in comments relayed by the ICF on Wednesday. ""Several of the top men's slalom paddlers have stayed with us in New Zealand while they've been training with Mike and I owe it to all of them to do the most professional job possible,"" she added. Mike Dawson, who was born and raised in the Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand, says the best way for him to stamp out any perceptions of favoritism is to not make any mistakes. ""If I'm paddling well, the gate judges won't come into play at all,"" he said. He is not the only New Zealander competing in the canoe slalom: Luuka Jones, also from Tauranga, became the first New Zealand woman to compete in the kayak competition in the Olympics after qualifying for the 2008 Beijing Games. London will be her second Olympics, at the age of just 23. For Mike Dawson, the Games are full of new experiences. ""We've been in the Olympic Village for a few days and it's pretty cool,"" Mike Dawson said. ""I can see how people get intimidated, but really it's just like a hotel with an epic food court.""","Mike Dawson is competing in the men's kayak event at the Olympics .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Teresa Romero Ramos, a Spanish nurse's aide who had contracted Ebola after caring for a patient with the deadly disease, is now free of the virus, Spain's Special Ebola Committee said Sunday. ""Today I'm very happy, because it can be said that Teresa has overcome this illness,"" Romero's husband, Javier Limon, said in a video statement released by a family spokeswoman. Two earlier tests showed that Ebola levels in the health worker were almost nil, and a third test came back negative. ""The last two measurements were in 'background' levels, and there is no significant statistical difference with negative results,"" Luis Enjuanes, an expert on viruses, said in a phone interview, in English, with CNN. ""If for three times, throughout one week, you are background, background, background, in practical terms it means you don't have the virus."" Officials have previously said that the amount of the Ebola virus in Romero's blood had decreased dramatically from the time she was rushed to the hospital two weeks ago, but Enjuanes explained just how close to negative she has already come, even before the latest test sample on Sunday. Why some survive Ebola, some don't . Romero has recovered enough to produce antibodies, he said. ""It means she's making her own protection, so any virus fooling around probably will be destroyed or neutralized,"" said Enjuanes, who's been attending the near-daily meetings of the government's special committee on Ebola, a panel of medical and scientific experts convened to deal with the crisis. Even though Romero received the negative result for the Ebola virus on this third key test in a week, she will surely remain in hospital for days, possibly a few weeks, in order to recover, Enjuanes said. She has received two main treatments in her battle against Ebola, for which there is still no vaccine. The first was an IV drip with the antibodies of an Ebola survivor -- a Catholic nun who survived the disease in West Africa. And Romero also received an experimental anti-viral drug, favipiravir, Enjuanes said. Spain imported another experimental drug, ZMab, but could only get an older version -- not the newest version, whose stocks have run low globally -- and Romero's doctors decided not to use it on her, Enjuanes said. To fight her lung problems while also battling Ebola, the doctors administered anti-inflammatory drugs to ease her respiratory problems, even while unsure how that treatment might affect the anti-Ebola measures, Enjuanes said. Madrid euthanizes Ebola patient's dog . Other patients test negative . Two other patients being monitored at Carlos III hospital also tested negative for the virus on Sunday, according to the Special Ebola Committee. The National Microbiology Institute received tests of Romero and the two other individuals under observation at Carlos III hospital, said the institute's director, Manuel Cuenca. The tests from a man under observation in Tenerife will be received on Monday, Cuenca told CNN. As of Sunday morning, Romero was the only confirmed Ebola patient, according to a statement from the committee. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro, Nic Robertson and Joshua Berlinger contributed to this report .","Teresa Romero Ramos, a Spanish nurse's aide, is considered free of Ebola virus .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Six Zimbabweans arrested last year for watching footage of the Arab Spring protests were found guilty Monday of conspiracy to commit public violence. The men face six to 10 years in prison or a $2,000 fine when they are sentenced in a Harare court Tuesday. They were among 46 people arrested on February 19, 2011, during an academic meeting where a video on events in Tunisia and Egypt was shown. ""I am very disappointed that they were found guilty,"" defense lawyer Alec Muchadehama said after hearing the verdict. Rights activist Munyaradzi Gwisai said the verdict was ""not surprising."" ""We are not deterred,"" Gwisai said. ""We are not intimidated."" Police released 40 of the attendees, but charged the rest with treason or attempt to overthrow the government by unconstitutional means. Those charges were altered to conspiracy to commit public violence. The government has said the six were plotting an Egyptian-style uprising in the southern African country. Critics have called the charges politically motivated. The defendants were allegedly watching video footage of protests that led to the ouster of Presidents Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, 87, is not unlike the toppled leaders. He has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980 and has been accused of rigging elections and instituting repressive laws to tighten his grip on power. The arrests may be an indication authorities are worried the winds of change sweeping across North Africa may inspire Zimbabweans to rise up, too. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change, MDC, which is in a troubled unity government with Mugabe's ZANU-PF, has called the arrests ""an abuse of state machinery by ZANU-PF to suppress the people's views."" Mugabe has called for new elections but his political rival and leader of the MDC, Morgan Tsvangirai, has threatened to boycott the poll if a referendum on a new constitution is not held. In an interview with CNN, Tsvangirai called Monday's judgment ""very, very unfortunate. One thing I would say is it's totally uncalled for."" Asked whether an Arab Spring-type movement is needed in Zimbabwe, he said, ""Now we are on another path of negotiation and setting up a transitional government and having elections -- there's no need for it.""

"(CNN) -- The United States' decision to close its embassy in Yemen came after intelligence suggested that four al Qaeda operatives may be planning an attack on the compound, a senior administration official said Monday. The United States had information that a group of eight terrorists had been planning an attack, the official said. Three were killed by Yemeni forces in recent days and another was captured wearing a suicide vest, but the other four were believed to be at large, the official said. The United States and Britain closed their embassies Sunday. Britain's Foreign Office also cited security concerns. Several other nations also made changes at their embassies Monday, including Japan, France, Spain and Germany. Each country cited the need for increased security measures. France closed its embassy to the public. A French Foreign Ministry spokesman told CNN that embassy employees will continue their work, but without any visits from the public. The spokesman said the ministry was not acting on a specific threat. Japan halted service at the consulate section of its embassy in Sanaa. The Japanese Foreign Ministry said the decision was based on the threat of terror, though not a specific threat. The embassy continued functioning. Spain restricted public access to its embassy, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said, adding that the embassy continued to function ""normally."" Germany said that while its embassy remained fully operational, security measures were increased. A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said fewer visitors were allowed into the embassy compound. The embassy had not received any terror threats, the spokesman said. Yemen 'fertile ground' for terrorists . The wave of concern follows last month's attempted terrorist attack on a U.S.-bound airliner. Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility. On Saturday, U.S. President Barack Obama linked the Nigerian suspect, 23-year-old Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, to the group, which is a combination of al Qaeda networks in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. John Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, ""What we do is to take every measure possible to ensure the safety of our diplomats and citizens abroad, so the decision was made to close the embassy."" The United States is working closely with the Yemeni government on the proper security precautions, he said. The U.S. Embassy in Yemen has come under attack numerous times in recent years. In September 2008, 10 people were killed -- among them police and civilians, but no embassy employees -- when insurgents opened fire and set off explosions outside the compound. On December 31 the U.S. Embassy alerted Americans in Yemen to remain on alert for the possibility of terrorist violence. ""I think what we've seen over the past several years in Yemen is an increasing strengthening of al Qaeda forces in Yemen,"" Brennan told CNN. ""There are several hundred al Qaeda members there."" British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told the BBC, ""We've got to also get back to the source of this, which is Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan, and we've got to recognize that we've got a group of young people who have been radicalized as a result of teaching by extremist clerics, and we've got to recognize that we're fighting a battle for hearts and minds here as much as everything else."" He vowed Britain will work with American authorities to support the Yemeni government in its counterterrorism efforts. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said the attempted attack on the airliner was in retaliation for airstrikes against it on December 17 and 24. One of those attacks targeted four al Qaeda operatives believed to have been planning an imminent attack against either the United States or Saudi Arabian embassies in Yemen, or both, a senior U.S. military official told CNN Sunday. Three of the targets were killed in the attack and a fourth was wounded, the official said. On Saturday, Gen. David Petraeus, head of the U.S. Central Command, met with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen, a senior U.S. government official told CNN. During his meeting with Petraeus, Saleh expressed his appreciation for U.S. help in combating extremists, offered more support for U.S. counterterrorism strikes and said he would continue providing assistance for the U.S. investigation into the attempted bombing. The two men discussed the latest intelligence on al Qaeda in Yemen, the official said, adding that the group in the U.S.-Yemeni meeting was kept very small on both sides. In remarks Saturday, Obama pledged that everyone involved in the attack would be held accountable, and highlighted his administration's attempts to crack down on extremist enclaves in Yemen. He reiterated his long-standing promise to ""disrupt, dismantle and defeat"" al Qaeda. Obama said that AbdulMutallab had recently traveled to Yemen and that ""its appears that he joined an affiliate of al Qaeda."" Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula apparently trained AbdulMutallab, equipped him with explosives and directed him to attack the plane, the president said in his weekly radio address. Obama has been criticized by some political opponents for not responding more aggressively to the bombing attempt. From the first day, the Obama administration has been focused on Yemen, Brennan said Sunday. ""We are very concerned about al Qaeda's continued growth there, but they're not just focused on Yemen,"" he said of al Qaeda. ""They are, in fact, looking toward the West."" That's why, he said, ""we have to get to this problem in Yemen now.""

"Washington (CNN) -- In another public embarrassment for the Air Force's nuclear missile program, two crew members were disciplined earlier this year for leaving silo blast doors open while they were on duty in an underground facility housing nuclear missiles. The incidents, first reported by the Associated Press, were confirmed Wednesday by the Air Force. Under Air Force regulations, a two-man missile launch crew is required to keep the underground blast door shut when one crew member is asleep during the 24-hour shift. In April a crew member was found ""derelict in his duties in that he left the blast door open in order to receive a food delivery from the onsite chef"" while the other crew member was on an authorized sleep break, Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. John Sheets said in a statement. The crew member who was found ""derelict"" received a punishment of forfeiting $2,246 in pay for each of two months. The other crew member admitted to similar misconduct ""on a few occasions"" and received a letter of admonishment. The April incident occurred at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota . In May, at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, a maintenance team was allowed into an underground launch control center while one crew member was sleeping, in violation of rules. In this case, the commander of the crew, when questioned about the incident, told the deputy to lie about being asleep, which she initially did, according to officials. The incident was investigated, and both crew members were disciplined. The commander is forfeiting $3,045 in pay for each of two months and facing a discharge board. The silo blast doors are at the bottom of a shaft that leads to the launch control center. The heavy-duty blast doors are meant to protect the launch control center in event of a nuclear blast. That center controls up to 10 missile silos. Air Force officials insist security was not compromised in these incidents because there are multiple layers of security above ground that would keep unauthorized personnel from gaining access to a launch control center. The centers are generally 40 feet to 100 feet underground, and the two-man crew controls as many as 10 missile silos. There also are multiple layers of security surrounding nuclear launch codes. But the disclosures come on the heels of the firing of the two-star general in charge of the Air Force's three nuclear wings. Earlier this month, Maj. Gen. Michael Carey was ""relieved"" of command ""due to a loss of trust and confidence in his leadership and judgment,"" the Air Force said at the time. Carey's removal had to do with reports of alleged misbehavior on a business trip. In August, one of the Air Force's nuclear wings failed a safety and security inspection and a separate wing did poorly in an inspection earlier in the year, which resulted in 17 military personnel being decertified from their jobs. They have since undergone retraining and are back at work.","Two disciplined for leaving silo blast doors open .

"(CNN) -- The office of House Speaker John Boehner slammed comments by an architect of Obamacare who said the health care law was sold to the American public with misleading messaging, arguing Jonathan Gruber's remarks confirm the ill-will behind passage of the law.

"(CNN) -- A Nebraska ""hate crime"" that targeted an openly gay woman and that triggered responses from candlelight vigils locally to Facebook postings of support nationwide was staged by the alleged victim, authorities said Tuesday as they charged the woman with lying to police. Charlie Rogers -- a former basketball player for the University of Nebraska who identifies herself as lesbian -- told police that three masked men entered her home on July 22, stripped her, tied her down, and carved homophobic slurs into her body before attempting to set her and the house on fire. But the Lincoln Police Department said Tuesday that ""the physical evidence conflicted with Charlie Rogers' version of events"" and that ""extensive investigation revealed numerous inconsistencies."" Previously on CNN.com: Woman speaks out after alleged hate crime . Rogers was arrested Tuesday, police said. Her attorney, Brett McArthur, told CNN Tuesday night that Rogers had agreed as part of an arrangement to turn herself in, in exchange for a personal recognizance bond. ""She did not have to post any money"" to be released, McArthur said, adding that his client pleaded not guilty to the charge of lying to police. ""She maintains her innocence. This has been kind of a kick in the gut as a victim to turn around and be charged,"" McArthur said. In a news release, police cited DNA and pathologists' examinations that did not substantiate Rogers' original statements, and changes in her story during the investigation. ""These were serious allegations that garnered national attention and spread fear among local citizens,"" the police statement said. ""A great deal of time and resources were spent investigating Charlie Rogers' claims in hopes of identifying and arresting the three suspects in this case."" Beth Rigatuso, president of Heartland Pride based in Omaha, organized a vigil that attracted over 1,000 people in the aftermath of the reported attack. For her, the news that it may have been a hoax is ""a pretty big blow."" ""I don't feel betrayed as much as I feel sad for how, if this is really true...there is a lot of things going on with her,"" Rigatuso said. ""It leads to a bigger problem in our society that someone would do this."" Rigatuso said she hopes people would not turn their backs on Rogers now. The vigil she put together in Omaha raised more than $1,800, all of which was deposited in an account for Rogers. ""We'd like to get the funds returned to us so we can establish our own fund to support victims of anti-gay violence."" Rigatuso said Tuesday. McArthur, Rogers' attorney, said he ""knows nothing"" about the fund or how much money might be in it. He said it was in place before he became Rogers' lawyer. According to the Lincoln Police Department complaint, Rogers, 33, provided information ""she knew to be false"" with the intent to ""instigate an investigation of an alleged criminal matter."" Rogers reported to police that she was lying on her bed when the alleged attackers held her down and carved ""derogatory words"" into her arms and abdomen and ""a cross"" in her chest. She told police she was then rolled onto her stomach where more cuts were made. But according to a deposition from Lincoln police investigator Lynette Russell filed as part of the complaint, Rogers bedspread was ""evenly placed on the bed and no apparent sign of a struggle."" A DNA lab test found no evidence of blood on the bedspread. Russell also described a pair of white gloves found at the scene that Rogers had said were not hers. ""Ms. Rogers DNA profile was the major contributor to the DNA located on the inside of the gloves,"" Russell said. Furthermore, the deposition said, the FBI sent photos of Rogers' cuts to a forensic pathologist, who believed the wounds to be self-inflicted. ""This opinion is based partially on the fact that the cuts appeared superficial and symmetrical, avoided sensitive areas of the body,...are accessible to the victim and follow the victim's frame of reference for reading and writing,"" the deposition said. Rumors had been circulating in recent weeks in Lincoln and on the Internet due to the fact that police had yet to pinpoint any suspects. The urge to respond to rumors prompted Rogers to give her one and only interview. ""For people to think this doesn't happen here, it does,"" Rogers told CNN affiliate KETV on July 27. ""It did."" She refused to discuss the incident itself during that interview. Rogers' attorney at the time, Megan Mikolajczyk, told CNN her client was ready for a full interview early last week, but canceled saying ""things have changed."" Mikolajczyk said Tuesday that she is no longer Rogers' attorney. According to neighbor Linda Rappl, Rogers' showed up on her doorstep bloodied in the early morning hours immediately following the alleged attack last month. ""I was in shock,"" Rappl said soon after the incident. ""She was naked, her hands were tied with zip ties. All I could see was a cut across her forehead and blood running down."" Rappl said she took the sobbing Rogers inside and wrapped her in a blanket before calling 911.","NEW: The woman pleads not guilty to lying to police, her attorney says .

"(CNN) -- ABC's newest family, the affluent Johnsons on ""Black-ish,"" has been very well-received. The freshman comedy, about a successful African-American family man's struggle with cultural identity, made its debut on the network Wednesday night to impressive ratings. The pilot episode had an audience of 10.8 million and a rating of 3.3 in the key demographic of 18-49. By comparison, ""Black-ish's"" lead-in, the multiple Emmy-winning ""Modern Family,"" started its sixth season Wednesday with 10.9 million watching and a rating of 3.7. To put it another way: This is exactly how you want your pilot episode to launch. Written by Kenya Barris and starring Anthony Anderson, Tracee Ellis Ross and Laurence Fishburne, ""Black-ish"" centers on an African-American family living a comfortable life in the suburbs. Dad Andre ""Dre"" Johnson (Anderson) is an advertising exec raising four kids with his doctor wife (Ross). He is also acutely aware of how far he's come from his upbringing. ""I guess for a kid from the 'hood, I'm living the American dream,"" Anderson's Dre says in an opening voiceover. ""The only problem is, whatever American had this dream probably wasn't where I'm from. And if he was, he should've mentioned the part about how when brothers start getting a little money, stuff starts getting a little weird."" Dre admits that he sometimes feels like ""a bit of an oddity"" in his neighborhood, and throughout the pilot he worries that his four kids are growing up without a clear understanding of who they are. For example, his son Andre Jr. prefers to be called ""Andy,"" tries out for field hockey instead of his dad's sport of choice, basketball, and is angling for a bar mitzvah for his birthday. And at work, Dre is faced with eye-rolling questions from colleagues on ""how a black man would say good morning,"" and the possibility that he was promoted to head the agency's ""urban"" division because of his race. (Dre's internal response to the promotion: ""Wait. Did they just put me in charge of black stuff?"") But while Dre's fretting could (and does) raise more serious conversations about race, class and identity, ""Black-ish"" is still a comedy, and critics have praised it for knowing just how to leverage its complex subject for laughs. ""Even in a better season, ABC's provocative and very funny 'Black-ish' would stand out for its broad and biting satire of an uneasily post-racial society seen through a very modern-family prism,"" said TV Guide. ""I'm grateful that 'Black-ish' exists, first and foremost because it's funny,"" said The Huffington Post's Maureen Ryan. But, she continued, ""'Black-ish' has to be more than just another pretty good sitcom. As one of the few comedies on a major network with a predominantly African-American cast, it has to navigate the issue of race in America. It can't just be funny, it has to be astute and adept as well. The good news is that so far, it navigates that challenging territory with intelligence, wit and subversive purpose."" Entertainment Weekly wasn't as convinced, critiquing the series as ""funny, but ... not revolutionary."" Giving it a ""B"" grade, EW's critic felt the comedy ""skews too broad,"" and some of that mixed reaction could be found on Twitter. Responses ranged as widely as flat-out hating it and finding it racist to being pleasantly surprised. But of course, we're only one episode in, as Time's James Poniewozik pointed out in his review. "" 'Black-ish's' nuance is promising -- it's aware that there's not just one way to be black -- and the sheer level of execution suggests it has staying power,"" he said. ""For now, I can only say what I want to hear about any new half-hour: it happens to be funny.""","ABC premiered one of its new comedies, ""Black-ish,"" on Wednesday night .

"Seoul (CNN) -- North Korea's revered founder, Kim Il Sung, ordered his doctors to find a way to make him live to 100, taking treatments to stay young that ranged from the bizarre to the sinister. Kim So-Yeon, his personal physician for many years before she defected to South Korea in 1992, led research at a ""Longevity Center"" set up to help in Kim's quest for a longer life. It didn't work -- he died at 82 -- but that's still far better than the average 64-year life expectancy for the country. People who made it to 100 and beyond . The doctor's team devised many different ways to ensure a longer life. ""We did a lot of research,"" says Kim. ""But we only gave him the treatments he had chosen from our list of options."" One treatment the late leader favored in his later years, according to Kim, was blood transfusions from citizens in their twenties. Those who had been chosen for the honor of donating blood to the ""Eternal President"" were fed special nutritious food beforehand. ""He wanted to rule as long as he could. I think he wanted to live a long life for his own satisfaction,"" says Kim. Another favorite, according to Kim, was watching young children do funny or cute things to make him laugh. The center decided happiness brings good health, so prescribed more laughter to the North Korean leader. Kim is seen smiling in many official photos. Comparison with younger Kim . After witnessing the stresses and health issues experienced by Kim, the doctor says Kim Jong Un, the country's current leader and Kim's grandson, could be suffering from similar problems. The elder Kim has often often been compared to his grandson, who shares his looks and demeanor. Walking with a cane, the young leader appeared in public last week for the first time in more than a month amid speculation about his health. Before his disappearance, Kim was seen limping, prompting theories that he was suffering everything from weight gain to gout. According to the doctor, the young leader may have inherited a number of health issues, including psychological problems and a history of obesity. She told CNN both Kim Il Sung and Kim's father Kim Jong Il suffered from diabetes, heart problems and stress, and she reckons that the younger Kim's health problems could be worse than his father's and grandfather's. After studying photos, she said Kim's face appeared to have been swollen due to painkillers and she also speculated that he has been receiving hormone shots to make him look more like his grandfather. CNN cannot independently verify this claim. ""Kim Il Sung still has a good reputation because he was the founder of the country. So in order to instill in people that it is still Kim Il Sung's country, I think they are trying to make Kim Jong Un look like more like him.""","Former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung wanted to live to 100, his doctor says.

"Tripura, India (CNN) -- The pictures may be difficult to look at, but 18-month-old Roona Begum's story of survival is remarkable. Soon after she was born in a remote village in northeastern India, Roona was diagnosed with an extreme form of hydrocephalus -- a disorder causing cerebral fluid to build up in the brain. Doctors had given Roona just a few months to live. ""Day-by-day, her head started growing bigger, she stopped wanting to eat, she would just lie in bed, it became very difficult for us to carry her and take her anywhere,"" says Roona's father Abdul Rehman says. Roona's head grew to a circumference of 94 centimeters, almost triple the size of a normal baby. There were ten liters of excess fluid inside her brain. Her head was so heavy she could barely move. Hydrocephalus is more common among infants and older adults. The condition is caused by overproduction, obstruction or lack of absorption of the cerebral fluid in the brain. The skin of her head has stretched so far, it pulled her eyelids over her eyes, making it impossible for Roona to see. Her mother, Fatima Begum, would draw eyebrows on Roona with black kohl everyday just to try and make her look more normal. ""She had such a big head, it was scary for people to see her,"" Fatima explains. Roona may be Abdul and Fatima's only child, but they couldn't afford to treat her. Roona's 18-year-old father works at a brick kiln earning less than $3 a day. For more than a year and a half, they took care of Roona in their two-room mud hut, with little knowledge or means of doing much else. In April this year, a journalist took photos of Roona and soon people all over the world including two Norwegian students Natalie Krantz and Jonas Borchgrevink were moved by her condition. Krantz and Borchgrevink put Roona's photo on a crowd funding website, hoping to raise $1,600 to cover her shunt surgery. In two months, they raised double that amount, and by August 2013, they raised more than $60,000. They've transferred half of this amount to the charity arm of Fortis Hospital in New Delhi for her treatment. The hospital covered the remaining half of the expenses. The students plan to send the remaining amount for Roona's aftercare. When Roona arrived at Fortis, her condition shocked even chief neurosurgeon Sandeep Vaishya, who has treated hundreds of children with hydrocephalus. ""We had never seen anything like that and we were completely clueless as to how we'd go about treating her. There was no precedent of treating a child with such an extreme case of hydrocephalus. We learned as we went,"" Vaishya says. Initially, Vaishya wasn't hopeful about the surgery. Roona was malnourished, she had major infections on the back of her head from the pressure of lying down all day, and her skin was very thin and delicate. Cerebral shunt is the standard treatment for hydrocephalus. It's a simple procedure which involves inserting a drainage tube to keep the fluids flowing at the proper rate. But due to the size of Roona's head and her small, frail body, Roona's treatment was particularly challenging. Vaishya says the surgery posed a huge risk to her life, and at one point they almost lost her. Much to the relief of her parents and her doctors, Roona has pulled through. After five surgeries, Roona's head is now down to a circumference of 58 centimeters, still larger than the average 38 to 48 centimeters, but small enough to allow her to live a reasonably normal life. She constantly moves her head around, she is playful and most importantly, she can now see. She is finally getting the chance to be the baby she really is. ""It feels really good to see her now, she looks beautiful and happy,"" Fatima says. Back in her village, Roona has become the center of attention. It's still painful for her to sit up but she smiles a lot, and her eyes, now visible, keep wandering in a frenzied pace. ""We want Roona to read and write once she grows up. Both of us (mother and father) are illiterate so we don't want her to be like us. We want her to have a bright future,"" Fatima says. It's too early to tell if Roona will ever be completely normal in her appearance as several operations still lie ahead, but the signs thus far are promising.","Just 18 months old, Roona Begum has had multiple surgeries for extreme hydrocephalus .

"Madison, Wisconsin (CNN) -- A left-leaning website that union supporters used to rally protesters in Wisconsin was partially blocked as demonstrators gathered in the state Capitol over a controversial budget bill. The website, defendwisconsin.org, could not be accessed on Monday and into Tuesday morning in the Capitol building, where crowds assembled over proposed legislation that would increase the costs of benefits to public employees and curb their collective-bargaining rights. Wisconsin Democratic Party press secretary Graeme Zielinski blamed Gov. Scott Walker and Republican lawmakers -- who returned to work Tuesday -- for causing the outage. ""In a direct assault on the First Amendment, Scott Walker's administration is blocking access in the Wisconsin Capitol to opposition websites,"" Zielinski said. The governor's spokesman, Cullen Werwie, responded Tuesday, calling the accusation ""a lie."" ""The Department of Administration blocks all new websites shortly after they are created, until they go through a software approval program that unblocks them,"" Werwie said. ""Within 30 minutes of being notified this website was blocked, DOA circumvented the software and immediately made the website accessible."" He said, ""The Democratic Party should spend less time lying about Gov. Walker and more time trying to get their AWOL state senators back to Wisconsin,"" referring to Democratic efforts to prevent a quorum in the Senate. The Capitol internet service, which restricts access to certain websites considered inappropriate for lawmakers, revealed a ""blocked page"" when users tried to access the site using the building's wireless system. Users were able to access the site elsewhere. The outage comes on the heels of a speech by Walker, who defended the budget proposal and criticized unions for squandering state coffers and impeding fiscal reform. ""We're broke,"" he told reporters Monday. ""You really can't negotiate when you don't have money to negotiate with."" Unions have argued that collective bargaining -- a process of negotiations meant to regulate working conditions -- has helped protect wages and health care, enforce workplace safety and serve as a means to arbitrate employee grievances. The budget-repair bill, proposed by Walker to address a $137 million shortfall through June 30, would increase contributions of state workers to their pensions and health insurance benefits. It requires collective-bargaining units to conduct annual votes to maintain certification. It also eliminates the right of unions to have dues deducted from worker paychecks. Walker warned that not passing the proposed bill would result in at least 1,500 government employees being laid off in the short term and could result in the layoffs of upward of 6,000 workers in the following budget cycle. Last week, 14 Democratic state senators essentially boycotted the Legislature and went to Illinois to prevent a quorum from passing the bill. The measure's opponents said they won't allow a vote unless Walker negotiates on the plan to eliminate collective-bargaining rights for everything but wages. CNN's Chris Welch contributed to this report.","NEW: Governor's spokesman calls the accusation ""a lie""

"Washington (CNN) -- Between the Ebola threat, fears about ISIS, a slow economic recovery and little enthusiasm for President Barack Obama or Congress, it's hard to believe that many Americans feel good about anything. But an overlooked piece of data in a recent CNN/ORC poll revealed a surprising number of Americans are upbeat despite the seemingly constant onslaught of bad news. When asked, ""how are things going in the country today,"" 50% of respondents said things were going either ""very well"" or ""fairly well."" Of course, that's not an overwhelming vote of confidence in the state of the union. And, indeed, 49% of people in the same survey felt the country was in bad shape. Still, it is the first time at least half of the people who took part in CNN's regular surveys expressed that much confidence since April 2013. And it was only the seventh time at least 50% said that they felt this good since early in 2004. In some ways this relative equanimity may not be as surprising as it may seem at first blush. For some time, researchers have seen a brightening mood in the country about the economy. And despite breathless concerns being voiced in several quarters that the existence of several Ebola patients would transform the U.S. into a sequel of the movie ""Contagion,"" the public has not become very worried about the disease. According to Keating Holland, CNN's polling director, the percentage of people who feel good about the current status of the country, ""has been ticking up the last few times we asked the question. It went down when the ISIS crisis started and before the Syrian airstrikes started. That tells me that people were worried about ISIS, but they became less concerned when the U.S. started taking some sort of action."" The optimism isn't much help to Democrats heading into the midterm elections weighed down by unhappiness with Obama. Majorities in the same CNN/ORC poll still disapprove of his handling of the economy, foreign affairs and health care policy. Half of those surveyed also disapprove of his handling of terrorism. And the sanguine mood can also be ephemeral, changing from week to week as different news events impact the sense of calm. For example, the CNN/ORC poll was conducted before the death of Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who was hospitalized in Dallas with Ebola and the news that one of the health care working tending to him also contracted the disease. There is no question that the CNN/ORC survey is out of step of most polls that depict the American public in a fearful and dour mood. Just this week, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that two-thirds of registered voters felt the country is on the ""wrong track,"" while just a quarter believe it was headed in the right direction. The varying results could be explained in the difference in the question's wording. Asking how things are going today prompts a person to make a clear-eyed assessment of the status of the country right now. The right track/wrong track question asks people to gage how things will be in the future. It is not inconceivable for a person to feel pretty sanguine about the current states of affairs, but very worried about what could be around the corner. ""There have been times in American history -- and this may be one of them -- when people feel things are ok right now, but there are good reasons to be concerned about what may happen in the future,"" Holland said. Beyond feeling somewhat better ISIS, there is the economy. It is possible that lower unemployment, an uptick in consumer spending and the robust growth in GDP growth may be starting to affect outlook. ""There are a lot of polls showing improvement in the public's perception of how the economy is doing,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who specializes in analyzing polls and public opinion. ""Having said that, it's been a long, slow road to full recovery."" While some experts say that the continued stagnation in wage growth contributes most to the publics displeasure with the economy, there is one trend that is making a large contribution to the improve public mood: gasoline prices. Despite continued turmoil in the Middle East, prices at the pump are set to be at their lowest level since 2010, according to gasbuddy.com, which tracks prices in North America. The website says 10% of the country's gas stations are pricing a gallon of regular gasoline under $3.00. While many economic statistics such as GDP growth and jobless figures are mere abstractions to most people, gasoline prices are a tangible marker visible on almost every street corner, every day. ""One economic indicator you see once every few minutes while driving around your neighborhood is the price of gas,"" said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""It registers with people when that improves and I believe it feeds into consumer confidence and polling results."" Happiness about the fall in gasoline prices could be offset by increases in the cost of meat, bread, milk and other food staples. But since studies indicate that women overwhelmingly still do the grocery shopping, men are somewhat insulated from confronting fluctuations in food prices. In contrast, everyone sees changes in the price of gas as they drive around town. That may be one reason why 56% of men felt things were going well in the country, compared to 44% of women. ""Gasoline is magical,"" says Tom Kloza, senior oil analyst for gasbuddy.com. ""Everybody knows what they pay for it.""","Many Americans still optimistic despite negative headlines.
Optimism isn't helping Democrats heading into the midterms.
Poll shows this is only the seventh time since 2004 that at least 50% said they felt this good."
"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Some people think wearable gadgets look cool. Perhaps they rock their Google Glass while out at happy hour, or flash the latest crowd-funded smart watch at the office. While the devices are undoubtedly conversation starters, and the look may be coveted in some circles, for the most part wearable technology has a fashion problem. At the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week, wearable devices are everywhere, and some are finally trying to break out of the gadget world and into the fashion world. Wearables is a broad and fast-growing category that, as the name implies, includes any small piece of technology that can be worn. Research firm ABI estimates the wearables market will hit $6 billion by 2018. Here at CES there are ""smart"" glasses, watches, bracelets, brooches, visors, necklaces and even bras. Straps secure small sensors against arms, chest, head or legs. There are even wearables for dogs, cats and children. The tasks wearables accomplish are as varied as the body parts they adorn. The technology inside these devices is moving ahead while the design side stagnates. Sensors are getting smaller, cheaper and more advanced. It's possible that the technology will become so advanced that trackers could bypass the design problem altogether by shrinking down electronic elements enough that they can be invisibly embedded in regular clothing, hats, shoes and belts. But not every company sees that on the horizon. ""We don't think the trackers we see today are going to go away in favor of a sensor-laden shirt or bra,"" said Woody Scal, the chief revenue officer at fitness tracker company Fitbit. Fitness trackers embrace the fun . The most popular wearables are fitness trackers, which use sensors to detect movement, heart rate, body temperature, breathing, sleep patterns, location and speed. In the fitness area at CES, low-profile and colorful bracelets inspired by the Nike FuelBand and Fitbit Flex and Force are the most common. There are the Garmin Vivofit and Jaybird Reign trackers, and the LG Lifeband Touch and Razer Nabu, which add in notifications from smartphones. The new Sony Core, a small stick that will fit in wrist-wear like the Sony SmartBand, acts as a fitness tracker but also branches out into life logging. It will be able to track mundane daily activities, weather, what movies you watch and what music you listen to, and notable events. It can also receive notifications from a paired smartphone, will likely cost around $135, and pops in and out of various brightly colored wrist bands. The traditional wearable look is passable for fitness gear, which is expected to be bold and sporty. Unfortunately the esthetic doesn't always translate into everyday wear. Most adults have moved beyond rocking brightly colored plastic baubles. They want sleekly designed accessories and brand names. Early stabs at jewelry . Some companies have smartly started to outsource the design process to people who know about fashion. Intel announced that it was teaming up with hipster design label Opening Ceremony on a bracelet that will be sold at Barneys, though specific design and pricing details are still unknown. Chip-maker CSR worked with jeweler Cellini to create a surprisingly nice Bluetooth pendant that has a single, customizable light for receiving notifications. On the odd side, the necklace can also be programmed to release perfume throughout the day. Fitbit announced it was dabbling in jewelry and partnering with Tory Burch on a Fitbit necklace and a bracelet. The products are still in the design stage, but drawings show decent gold jewelry that would look good even if it didn't contain a tracker. Not every company is getting outside help. Ezio makes gaudy $129 necklaces that pair with a smartphone and have stones that light up when someone calls or texts. ""The whole idea here is that people -- not everyone, but lots of people, we believe -- want their fitness trackers to be even more fashionable,"" said Fitbit's Scal. ""In the male-focused technology industry, we didn't think people were paying enough attention to women, to be honest."" Everyone's making a smart watch . Appealing to women is an issue with one of the most hyped wearable categories: smart watches. Gadgets calling themselves smart watches range from regular watch faces with light-up notifications to full featured Android phones worn on the wrist. The most appealing are designed to look like everyday analog watches, while others look like touch screens with a strap tossed on. When well done, a watch with a face big enough to accommodate smart features can pass as a nice men's accessory, but the majority are still far too bulky and awkward for women. The focus on the watch form factor has been oddly intense, with rumors of an Apple smart watch swirling for the past year and major companies like Samsung pushing out glitchy, undercooked technology like the Galaxy Gear. At CES, Intel, Qualcomm and indie darling Pebble all announced new smart watches, and there was a dedicated area for the wrist wear. The Burg ($149 to $399) takes a SIM card and can make calls. The $130 Cogito Pop looks like a classic watch but adds notifications from a paired smartphone. Qualcomm's $349 Toq is similar to the Pebble but with a full color screen and fewer apps. The new Pebble Steel is a proper stainless steel smart watch for $250. The most egregiously oversized smart watch on the CES floor is the Neptune Pine, a 2.4-inch touchscreen rectangle running Android Jelly Bean that will cost between $335 and $395 when released in March. Technically, it has all the features of a fully functioning Android phone, but the cramped screen means it works better as a secondary screen for viewing notifications, paired with a regular Android smartphone stashed in your bag or large pocket. One of the more clever smart watches at CES is the Filip, a simple and sturdy phone and location tracker for kids five to 11 years old. Parents can program in five phone numbers and the child can make and receive calls from those contacts, and receive but not send texts. An accompanying iOS or Android app can be used to pinpoint the kid's location on a map. The $199 device will be sold through AT&T stores and service will cost just $10 a month without a contract. On your face but out of the way . For the most part, wearables offer a limited selection of the features already available on smartphones. The idea is to save people from the distracting task of pulling out a phone, looking at it, tapping on it and returning it safely to a pocket. At the Cogito booth, Andres Muguira said a smart watch would help wearers filter incoming notifications so they would ""get to spend more time with loved ones."" That's the idea behind wearable glasses, either the most or least distracting wearable depending on your point of view. There were a number of Google Glass-like products at CES. GlassUp shows e-mails, texts, tweets and other messages on a display directly in front of the eye. The GlassUp design currently resembles safety glasses, but a mockup of the final version could almost pass for a regular pair of black thick-framed specs. Epson's Moverio BT-100 glasses look like the disposable sunglasses you get after a trip to the eye doctor. The industrial Vuzix glasses don't even attempt to pass as normal glasses, looking more like a futuristic monocle, but that could change if the company decides to make a commercial product. The best outcome for smart glasses, and all other wearable tech, is blending in by looking like products people already want to wear. They could follow Google's lead. The company was reportedly talking to hip glasses company Warby Parker about possible design partnerships for future versions of Google Glass.","Smart watches, fitness trackers and jewelry that flashes notifications are plentiful at CES .

"(CNN) -- Forty-eight new cases of an intestinal infection caused by ingesting food or water contaminated with feces have been reported in Texas this past week alone, officials said Thursday. Most reports come from the Dallas/Fort Worth area. The source of the illness is unknown. In the past, imported fresh produce led to outbreaks of cyclospora infection in the United States. The Texas Department of State Health Services has not confirmed whether the latest reports are produce-related. ""DCHHS is continuing to investigate the possible food sources of contamination and who may have been exposed to them,"" Zachary Thompson, the department's director said in a statement. The outbreak may be related to cyclospora reports in Iowa and Nebraska, according to the department's press release. On Tuesday, officials issued a health advisory warning residents of the infection. In 2012, 44 cases of the infection were reported in Texas. Another 14 cases were reported the year before. Symptoms include watery diarrhea, loss of appetite and nausea. The infection is not highly contagious because it must pass in bowel movements before it can spread to others, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People in tropical regions are at an increased risk of getting the infection. Medication is available for people who contract the infection. Those with weaker immune systems may require longer forms of treatment. ""To decrease the risk of eating fresh produce it is important to thoroughly rinse your fruits and vegetables several times,"" said Dr. Christopher Perkins, the Texas department's medical director said in a statement. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","Almost 50 new cases of cyclospora infection reported in Texas .

"(CNN) -- It may lack the grace of an airship, or the class of Concorde, but the ""Multicopter"" has a style all of its own. This somewhat awkward looking vehicle is the work of German company e-volo and a prototype has just made its first manned flight, after completing unmanned trials. With e-volo's Thomas Senkel strapped into the center of its four-limbed frame, it flew for one minute and 30 seconds over a field in Southern Germany, powered by 16 small rotor blades. E-volo says its creation is powered entirely by lithium batteries and can carry a load of around 80kg -- about as much as it weighs. Watch ""Multicopter's"" first manned flight. While the maiden flight may not have lasted long or covered much distance, it was enough to convince its designers that it has the potential to develop further. ""It could go longer,"" said e-volo's Alexander Zosel. ""But for safety we decided before the take off to fly one minutes 30 seconds."" ""This was a proof of concept, not really safe to fly,"" he added. ""We work on a prototype that we will fly in summer 2012 very safely."" The pilot steers the Multicopter using a joystick and, despite looking as though it might be grounded by a strong gust of wind, it is very easy to control, according to Zosel. Although there's plenty of development work left to do, e-volo believes the vehicle could one day be have a variety of uses, including an air taxi. And they say its ability to hover in one place means it has the potential to be used for search and rescue missions. ""There are many possible applications,"" said Zosel.

"Barcelona (CNN) -- A small, wealthy region feels at odds with Spanish rule. Taxes are too high; political representation is limited; the elite feels unheard and ill-treated; unrest and popular opposition spread. Hardliners in Madrid advocate repression and have the ear of a new ruler. Turmoil ensues and escalates until a major confrontation is inevitable. The situation in Catalonia in 2012? No. This is the Netherlands, in the 1560s and 1570s -- another prosperous region ruled by Spain, where citizens felt that their values and way of life were not respected by Madrid policies. What started as a minor conflict escalated until it became the Eighty Years' War. By its end, Spain had permanently lost control of the United Provinces. So what transformed minor differences between ruler and ruled into a life-and-death struggle? It started with a potent mix of cultural differences and opposition to high taxation. The rebellion included men like William of Orange, a State Councillor appointed to help the King of Spain in ruling the Dutch Republic. His dynasty had no intention of rebellion at all in the beginning. Until the crisis of 1566 -- 67, leading Dutch figures like William of Orange advocated moderate policies. Protestants, according to Orange, should have the right to practice their religion, without public assemblies or services; in other words, he only advocated freedom of conscience. He also opposed armed rebellion. Within a few short years, William of Orange came to lead the military rebellion against Spain, the only superpower of the 16th century -- a rebellion so large and tenacious that it stretched Spain's vast financial and military resources to breaking point and beyond. In the end, Madrid had to concede that it could not win; the United Provinces gained their independence, and became one of the most economically successful countries in Europe. What happened? Spain reacted to the demands for religious tolerance by its subjects the way that imperial powers run by religious zealots often do -- with heavy-handed repression. Philip II dispatched a large army under the Count of Alba to the Netherlands. Alba unleashed a fearsome military campaign against the rebels; the Counts of Horn and Egmont, who had demanded religious freedom, were executed; where cities resisted the Spanish army, they were besieged and the entire population was put to the sword (as happened in Haarlem). Spain's attempt at military ""roll back"" in the Low Countries backfired. It radicalized views amongst the Dutch elite. Guilty of no crimes or acts of treason, Orange fled to Germany, fearing the worst. His properties were confiscated and his son abducted to Spain. Faced with personal persecution from the Spanish side, Orange increasingly adopted radical policies. Eventually, he came to favor military revolt and an end of Spanish influence. Spain's giant military machine also faltered. Unpaid troops mutinied in 1575, and committed a major massacre when they attacked the loyal city of Antwerp. Almost overnight, the three-quarters of the United Provinces that had been loyal to the King of Spain switched sides; it was the beginning of the end for Spanish rule in the Low Countries. The Netherlands were not the only part of the Spanish Empire to break free from Spain after a revolt against high taxation and invasive rule from Madrid -- Portugal also regained its freedom in the 17th century under similar circumstances. Today, it is the turn of Catalonia to oppose the Madrid government. Again, a population and its elite feel culturally alienated, overtaxed, and unheard. Positions are hardening quickly, on both sides. ECB: Eurozone's reluctant leader . Conflict looks inevitable -- and may even turn bloody. The Spanish reaction to Catalan requests for greater independence today is arguably equally intolerant (but not yet as ferocious) as Philip II's attempt to subdue his Dutch subjects in the Low Countries. Instead of political negotiations and enlightened discussions, there has been a wave of threats and a campaign of disinformation: Spain will throw an independent Catalonia out of the EU; it will saddle it with sky-high debts; it will stop buying Catalan products, or send in the tanks. There is a shocking contrast between the way that London has dealt with Scottish demands for independence -- by allowing a referendum to go forward -- and the Spanish reaction. If there is one lesson from history, it is simple -- repression, intimidation and intolerance typically make things worse. Massive attempts at repression can easily backfire. Spain lost control of both the Dutch provinces and of Portugal after local revolts. The same pattern is also visible elsewhere: Irish independence became inevitable after the British government overreacted to minor skirmishes in 1916, sending in warships to bombard downtown Dublin during the ""Easter Rising."" The Eighty Years' War against the Dutch Republic provided a basis for Spain's ""Black Legend,"" a powerful form of anti-Catholic propaganda that mixed facts and exaggerations to depict Spain as a cruel, intolerant, and illegitimate power. Any overreaction to the coming referendum on Catalan independence today has the potential to similarly blacken its image for decades to come, and to give the lie to the image of peace and prosperity that earned the European Union the Nobel Peace Prize this year.","Catalonia is fighting for independence in Spain, which has been hit by crisis .

"(CNN) -- A 59-year-old man lay bloody on the driveway. His son stood nearby, both his hands cut off at the wrist. That's the gruesome scene Shasta County, California, sheriff's deputies encountered Monday afternoon, before calling ambulances to transport the two to area hospitals. A full day later, both Gregory Dunn and his son Jason are still alive despite their life-threatening injuries, said sheriff's office Detective Will Gardner. No charges had been filed in the case as of Tuesday afternoon. The incident is being investigated as an attempted homicide, police said. The bloody scene played out Monday in the northern California city of Redding, in a neighborhood close to a municipal airport in that city. According to police, what began as a verbal fight between family members at some point became physical. Based on interviews, the sheriff's office alleged that the 27-year-old son stabbed his father multiple times with scissors. Then, the sheriff's office said a press release, Jason Dunn mutilated himself by using a radial-arm saw to sever his hands. Neighbors heard the altercation, as did an unnamed witness who contacted authorities, according to Gardner. Gary Rinehart told CNN affiliate KRCR that he saw both men being wheeled from the scene into separate ambulances. The first, the son, had ""a lot of blood at the end of his arms, like his hands weren't there."" The second, the father, had ""blood in the upper area."" ""This is definitely the craziest thing that's ever happened on this street,"" Rinehart said. The father would walk his dog around the neighborhood, according to Rinehart, who described him as a ""nice guy"" based on their occasional conversations. The neighbor said he'd only met the son once in eight years living there, when Jason Dunn apologized for shooting a pellet gun toward another neighbor's house. Reflecting Tuesday on the bloody incident that occurred across the street from his home, Rinehart said, ""I just can't imagine anything like that happening between family.""","A northern California sheriff's office says a son stabbed his father with scissors .

"(CNN) -- The two men suspected of shooting to death a Chicago teenage girl are facing murder charges and will not get bond. Kenneth Williams, 20, and Michael Ward, 18, went before a judge Tuesday in their first courtroom appearance concerning the killing of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old who performed at a brunch before the January inauguration of President Obama. Police earlier said that Ward, who allegedly shot Pendleton, was on probation for unlawful use of a firearm. Ward confessed to shooting Hadiya and two others in late January in a case of mistaken identity, according to Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy. Police said Ward and Williams were gang members seeking revenge against the people who had shot Williams in July, men against whom Williams had refused to press charges when police arrested them. He and Ward thought they had spotted members of a rival gang at the park when police said Ward sneaked up on Hadiya and her friends and began shooting. Williams was the getaway driver, McCarthy said. Escalating gang violence has raised Chicago's murder tally for 2012 to 500, up 50 from 2011, officials said.","Michael Ward and Kenneth Williams make their first court appearance Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Argentina's Vice President Amado Boudou has been indicted on a bribery charge related to a currency printing contract awarded, while he was the nation's economy minister, to a company he allegedly controlled. Boudou is accused of ""passive bribery and inconsistent negotiations,"" according to the decision from Argentine Federal Judge Ariel Lijo that was released Friday. If convicted, Boudou could face up to six years in prison. Boudou, who was minister of economy from 2009 to 2011, is suspected of using his influence to ensure that a contract to print Argentina's currency was given to Ciccone CalcogrÃ¡fica, a company he allegedly controlled, judicial sources said. The vice president, who was in Cuba on an international tour, said through his lawyers Saturday that he was surprised by Lijo's decision, and he denied any wrongdoing. Boudou is the first acting vice president in Argentina's history to be prosecuted in a corruption case. The accusation comes at a sensitive time for Argentina as the government battles in U.S. courts against ""holdout"" creditors who want full repayment of bonds left over from the country's massive sovereign default in 2002. Boudou has rejected previous calls to step down. According to released documents, Boudou accepted as a bribe 70% of the shares of Ciccone Litografica. Boudou also is accused of collaborating in the process of helping the company come back from bankruptcy. According to Lijo, Boudou carried out the bribe and negotiations with the help of friends Jose Maria Nunez Carmona and Alejandro Vanderbroele, who also were indicted. The company's owner, Nicholas Ciccone, was indicted on a charge of active bribery, and his son-in-law, William Reinwick, is accused as an accomplice. Also indicted was Rafael Brenner Resnick, former chief of staff of the Argentine Federal Administration of Public Revenue, for presumably facilitating the payment plan to lift Ciccone Litografica -- which was beset with tax debts -- out of bankruptcy. The judge ruled that Boudou will remain free while awaiting trial, but he must pay a fine of 200,000 pesos -- about $25,000. His defense announced late Friday that they will appeal.","Charge is related to accusations against Amado Boudou when he was economy minister .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Ah Kuan vividly recalls the day she was granted residency in Hong Kong. The 32-year-old woman had been longing to settle in the city ever since she married a Hong Kong construction worker four years ago. But status as a resident from mainland China meant she first had to join a long queue. Migrant workers march in Hong Kong in May 2006 demanding better working conditions in the city. ""I felt as if I had won the lottery,"" a jubilant Kuan says of obtaining residency. ""Now I finally got what I want. I don't have to keep traveling in and out of Hong Kong to see my husband, and I can find a proper job."" Ah Kuan's story has become an increasingly frequent one since Beijing assumed authority over Hong Kong 10 years ago. During the past decade, an average of 142 mainlanders have moved to Hong Kong each day. All told, more than 518,000 mainland Chinese -- most of them wives and children of Hong Kong citizens -- have migrated to Hong Kong since the handover, according to Hong Kong's Immigration Department. Hong Kong has traditionally been viewed by mainland Chinese as a land of opportunity and a chance for a better life. Waves of mainland Chinese immigrants and refugees have come to Hong Kong to escape poverty, war and communism. Since Hong Kong has one of the world's lowest birth rates, the mainland immigrants are crucial to replenishing the territory's workforce. Nonetheless, the influx also poses many challenges to the former British colony, social observers say. The current wave of immigrants is changing the face of Hong Kong. And with the changes are coming increasing reports of discrimination and demands for more jobs from newly arrived immigrants, and increasing anxiety from Hong Kong Chinese about preserving social stability.  Watch how Hong Kong's wealth gap is widening » . Under a quota system in place since 1995, a maximum of 150 mainlanders per day are allowed to come to Hong Kong, according to Hong Kong's Immigration Department. Today, mainlanders account for 93 percent of the city's population growth, according to the Bauhinia Foundation Research, making them a key factor in shaping Hong Kong's present and future. The influx has changed social dynamics in Hong Kong; cross-border marriages have become increasingly common, for example. Today, 35 percent of marriages registered in Hong Kong involve a spouse from mainland China, according to Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department. But many mainlanders face hardship in Hong Kong, frequently stereotyped by Hong Kong residents as low-skilled workers with low income, an alien group that is ill-mannered, speaks with a funny accent and competes with the locals for jobs and welfare resources. ""Over the past decade, many poorly educated men in Hong Kong have married mainland women,"" says Professor Choi Yuk-ping, a sociologist at the Chinese University. ""These couples are mainly from the low-income group and the women are low-skilled with no work experience in a city. They are marginalized by society."" The influx of mainlanders has triggered a host of controversies that has sharpened divisions and tensions between Hong Kong Chinese and mainland Chinese residents living in Hong Kong. In recent years, local media have increasingly reported on pregnant women from mainland China who come to Hong Kong to give birth in order to secure immediate citizenship for their children. Many Hong Kong natives view such actions as straining Hong Kong's health-care resources. The number of babies born to these ""tourist mothers"" surged to 26,132 in 2006, from 7,810 in 2001, according to Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department. Adding to the challenge are some mothers who left the hospitals without paying bills, and a small number who have abandoned BABIES BORN with congenital diseases. ""It's a tremendous burden for us. Our services were already nearly stretched to the full. Now we have to work even longer hours,"" says Dr. Wong Hon-kwong, an obstetrician at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Hong Kong. ""The situation is not good for the mainland mothers, either. Many of them check out of the hospital a day after giving birth without any proper rest. They probably do that to save money."" To deter the mainlanders, public hospitals recently increased charges on non-local mothers by almost twofold, a measure that has provoked outrage among mainland mothers. ""We are from the low-income group. The new charges have made our life very difficult. We may have to borrow money,"" says mainland mother Annie Yeh, 25, who is pregnant with a second child. ""I can understand why Hong Kong people think we're robbing their resources. But I wouldn't come here if my husband were not from Hong Kong. I asked my 4-year-old daughter what she thought if I gave birth to the baby in the mainland. She cried and said 'we are a family, we must be together'."" The plight of the mainlanders is a result of the Hong Kong government's ""discriminatory measures,"" according to legislator and mainland migrant supporter Fernando Cheung Chiu-hong. ""The biggest problem is that the government is taking the lead to discriminate (against) the mainlanders. With a birth rate of less than 1 percent, Hong Kong has to rely on the mainlanders to create a future. If we don't handle the migrant issue properly, society will only become more divisive."" But not all mainland migrants face a life of hardship in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government welcomes young mainlanders with professional skills with open arms. As the city now suffers a shortage of high-skilled labor, the government is offering to grant residency to elites from the mainland and abroad. So far about 80 people have secured residency in this way. Local university graduates from the mainland are also finding it easier to land jobs in Hong Kong. Geng Chunya, 26, a native of northern China, even managed to start his own IT business with the help of government funding upon completing his doctorate degree here. ""The Hong Kong government is the best in the world. And I like Hong Kong. It's a freer place than mainland China and it treats us fairly,"" Geng says. ""Hong Kong needs us. We are young, well educated, unmarried and energetic."" James Tien Pei-chun, legislator and head of Hong Kong's Liberal Party, says the government should do more to attract high-skilled mainland migrants. ""We're facing a serious talent shortage and the top seeds from mainland China can help fill the void,"" he says. Professor Choi, however, says the Hong Kong must first address the problems linked to the more numerous low-skilled mainlanders. ""With our aging population, their arrival is definitely positive to Hong Kong in the long run. But currently the biggest challenge is to tackle poverty among the immigrants. Failing that, a lot of social conflicts would ensue,"" she says. ""For Hong Kong people, they must come to terms with the fact that mainland immigrants are part of society and they will make a lot of contributions in future. This is what we must recognize.""

"(CNN) -- Mario Balotelli made most of the headlines prior to Liverpool's game against Manchester City in the Premier League, but it was another striker -- a forgotten one -- who ended up as the star attraction hours later. That was Stevan Jovetic. Jovetic was signed with much fanfare from Fiorentina a year ago for about $36 million, but injuries and the form of other strikers at City meant he only made two league starts in 2013/2014. Inserted into the starting lineup by manager Manuel Pellegrini, Jovetic netted twice in City's 3-1 win in the showdown between teams that finished 1-2 last season. ""It wasn't so many beautiful moments until now because I had so many problems last year,"" Jovetic told Sky. ""But I don't want to think about that. That's past. ""Now I just want to enjoy with this team, these players to win more titles."" Substitute Sergio Aguero got City's third, with Liverpool replying through Pablo Zabaleta's own goal with less than 10 minutes remaining. Indeed, only when falling behind by three goals did Liverpool -- which capitulated to give City the title in May -- come to life. It was a far cry from the corresponding fixture last term, when Liverpool largely ran the show in an entertaining contest -- a 2-1 City win -- on Boxing Day. Liverpool opted for a more defensive approach Monday and couldn't call on the flair of Balotelli, the flamboyant, controversial -- though not as controversial as the man he is replacing, Luis Suarez -- Italian international. He signed from Milan earlier Monday. The result left City with two wins from two games, identical to the side expected to challenge Pellegrini's men for the title, Chelsea. Tottenham and Swansea are the only two other teams with perfect records. Jovetic pounced from close range after Dejan Lovren's poor clearance to give City a 1-0 lead at the break. And shortly after the break, in the 55th minute, Jovetic converted Samir Nasri's pass. ""Last year unfortunately (Jovetic) was injured a couple of times,"" Nasri told Sky. ""We saw that in pre-season he was on fire. I think it's just the start of a big season for him."" Aguero, on the pitch for a shade under 30 seconds, increased the lead after a perfectly weighted ball from Jesus Navas in the 69th before Liverpool's consolation effort in the 83rd. Simeone banned . In Spain, Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone received an eight-match ban for his conduct in the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Real Madrid on Saturday. Among his infractions was protesting with the fourth official and patting him on the head. He has since apologized for his actions, but it wasn't enough to prevent the lengthy suspension. Simeone, whose side won the trophy, will now miss, among other matches, Atletico's derby against Real on Sept. 13. Getting into trouble with the authorities is nothing new for Simeone, who guided Atletico to the league title last spring. He also missed Atletico's La Liga opener on Monday due to a ban stemming from last season. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a long-range effort for Real Madrid in its 2-0 win over newly promoted Cordoba in Real's first game in the league. Barcelona began its season with a 3-0 win over Elche on the weekend.","Manchester City beats Liverpool 3-1 in the Premier League on Monday .

"Rome (CNN) -- The United States promised Thursday to send food and medical supplies -- but not weapons -- to rebels in the first such move since the conflict began two years ago. At the same time, European nations began to explore how to strengthen rebel fighters short of arming them after a European Council decision allowing aid for civilian protection. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the aid would help fighters in their effort to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The conflict has claimed more than 60,000 lives, laid waste to large portions of the country and created an enormous humanitarian crisis as refugees flee the fighting. The fighting also threatens to widen into a regional crisis and has raised concerns that Hezbollah, Iran or others could gain control in Damascus after al-Assad's government falls. ""The United States' decision to take further steps now is the result of the continued brutality of a superior armed force propped up by foreign fighters from Iran and Hezbollah, all of which threatens to destroy Syria,"" Kerry said after meeting opposition leaders in Rome. He did not say how much aid, but did announce that the United States would separately give $60 million to local groups working with the opposition Syrian National Council to provide political administration and basic services in rebel-controlled areas of Syria. That's on top of $50 million in similar aid the United States has previously pledged to the council, as well as $385 million in humanitarian assistance, Kerry said. ""This funding will allow the opposition to reach out and help the local councils to be able to rebuild in their liberated areas of Syria so that they can provide basic services to people who so often lack access today to medical care, to food, to sanitation,"" he said. Islamist Influence . The aid represents, in part, an effort to hem in radical Islamist groups vying for influence in Syria after the fall of al-Assad, a senior State Department official told CNN. ""If the Syrian opposition coalition can't touch, improve and heal the lives of Syrians in those places that have been freed, then extremists will step in and do it,"" the official said. Sheikh Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, president of the Syrian National Council, said concerns about Islamist influence were overstated. ""We stand against every radical belief that aims to target Syria's diverse social and religious fabric,"" he said. U.S. officials hope the aid will help the coalition show what it can do and encourage al-Assad supporters to ""peel away from him"" and help end the fighting, the official said. The opposition council will decide where the money goes, Kerry said. But the United States will send technical advisers through its partners to the group's Cairo headquarters to ensure the aid is used properly, the senior State Department official said. Additional aid possible . The European Council carved out an exception in its sanctions against Syria on Thursday to allow for the transfer of nonlethal equipment and technical assistance for civilian protection only. The council did not specify what kind of equipment could be involved. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Friday on Twitter that his country would pledge new aid because ""we cannot stand still while the crisis worsens and thousands of lives are at stake."" A diplomatic official at the French Foreign Ministry told CNN that France is studying the possibility of supplying night-vision equipment or body armor. In the United States, President Barack Obama is thinking about training rebels and equipping them with defensive gear such as night-vision goggles, body armor and military vehicles, sources familiar with the discussions said. The training would help rebels decide how to use their resources, strategize and perhaps train a police force to take over after al-Assad's fall, one of the sources said. Kerry did not announce that sort of aid Thursday, but said the United States and other countries backing the rebels would ""continue to consult with each other on an urgent basis."" An official told reporters that the opposition has raised a number of needs in the Rome meetings and the administration will continue to ""keep those under review."" ""We will do this with vetted individuals, vetted units, so it has to be done carefully and appropriately,"" the official said. Humanitarian crisis . Meanwhile, the bloodshed continued. On Thursday, 98 people were killed across Syria, including 35 in Damascus and its suburbs, said the Local Coordination Committees for Syria, a network of opposition activists. The conflict began with demands for political reform after the Arab Spring movement that swept the Middle East and Africa, but devolved into civil war when the al-Assad regime cracked down on demonstrators. In addition to the 60,000 people who have died since the fighting began in March 2011, another 940,000 have fled the country and more than 10% of Syria's 20 million residents have been forced to move elsewhere inside the country, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said. The outpouring of refugees threatens to overwhelm the ability of host nations to provide for their needs, Assistant High Commissioner Erika Feller told the U.N. Human Rights Council on Tuesday. Jill Dougherty reported from Rome, and Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh and Elise Labott also contributed to this report.","France considers sending Syrian rebels night-vision gear and body armor, a source says .

"(CNN) -- South Korea held off a late rally by Chicago to win a third title in the Little League World Series. Despite letting up three runs in the bottom of the sixth inning, South Korea was able to seal the 8-4 victory. The country also won back-to-back titles in 1984 and 1985. Hwang Jae-yeong and Jeon Jin-woo drove in two runs apiece and Choi Hae-chan hit a solo home run. ""We know the time difference and that a lot of people were cheering for us,"" manager Jong Wook-park told The Associated Press. ""We appreciate the people back in Korea.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Arriving at the London premiere of his self-titled mockumentary dressed in an enormous bearskin hat, cropped red army tunic and barely there hot pants, flamboyant Austrian fashionista, ""Bruno,"" paid sartorial tribute to the British as only he knows how. Bear-ing all: British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen's latest comic creation Austrian fashionista, Bruno, hits the red carpet. Waxed to perfection and flanked by a group of muscular black men dressed like a camp Queen's Guards, the gay fashion reporter flounced down the carpet to greet his public. ""Vassup CNN! Lookin' hot,"" Bruno said to CNN. ""I don't want any attention; I'm not here to promote my movie."" ""Bruno,"" which hits cinemas in most territories next month, is the latest comic creation of British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, who last shocked, insulted and delighted audiences in 2006 with Borat, Kazakhstan's ""Most Famous Broadcaster."" Bruno continues the unique approach to comedy Baron Cohen honed with characters like uneducated, loutish jungle music fan Ali G and then homophobic, anti-Semitic Kazakh journalist Borat.  Watch ""Bruno"" on the red carpet » . His specialty is characters who say the unsayable: like Bruno's carpet quip that his new film is ""the most important movie starring a gay Austrian since 'Terminator 2,'"" in joking reference to the married (and firmly heterosexual) Austrian Terminator star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, now Governor of California.  In pictures: Bruno offers fashion advice to CNN » . Baron Cohen puts his creations in real-life situations and uses them to draw unsuspecting participants into letting well-hidden prejudices slip out, engage in embarrassing behavior or contradict themselves. Characters like Bruno and Borat ""essentially work as a tool,"" Baron Cohen told UK paper The Observer in a rare out-of-character interview: ""By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice."" Baron Cohen's approach courts controversy. ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" opened to a wave of outrage from race-relations campaigners. This time it is gay-rights campaigners who are up in arms. ""Sacha Baron Cohen's well-meaning attempt at satire is problematic in many places and outright offensive in others,"" Rashad Robinson, senior director of media programs for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation told the New York Times. While some critics may suggest that his films may reinforce prejudices, others disagree. ""It is difficult to accuse Cohen of making films that are racist or homophobic,"" Aubrey Day, Editor-in-Chief of Total Film magazine told CNN. ""He takes characters and exaggerates them for broad comic value, but I don't think there's any credence in the idea that he supports any of those ideals."" But Baron Cohen certainly knows how to manipulate the media. The 37-year-old has been whipping up anticipation for ""Bruno"" with a series of attention-grabbing, hilarious stunts. In September last year, he brought chaos to the hallowed fashion shows of Milan when he stormed the catwalk of designer Agata Luiz de la Prada's show dressed in a Velcro suit with clothes from backstage stuck all over it. Most recently, he descended from the ceiling at the MTV Movie Awards wearing nothing but a pair of angel's wings and a skimpy thong before ""falling"" onto irate rapper Eminem's face. Eminem stormed out of the awards but later admitted he knew about the stunt beforehand. ""Borat"" debuted at number one in the U.S. box office and went on to gross $300 million in box office and DVD sales. Industry experts are predicting an even bigger return for ""Bruno."" The secret of the Baron Cohen comedy phenomenon may lie in his combination of laughs with something a bit deeper: namely his ability to highlight prejudices and hypocrisies. ""What he does very well is hold a mirror up to a lot of society's current ideals and expose them for what they are,"" Day told CNN. ""That is one of the joys of his films. ""You can enjoy them on a simple level, in that they are very funny, but hopefully you also come away thinking, or maybe re-thinking some of your attitudes.""","""Bruno"" paid tribute to British icons in a bearskin hat at London movie premiere .

"(CNN) -- While his jockey starved himself to make the weight limit, one of horse racing's new stars delivered the goods again despite piling on the pounds. Australia, a three-year-old trained by champion Aidan O'Brien, romped to his fifth win in seven starts on Wednesday to add another notable victory to his resume. The chestnut colt with an impeccable bloodline fueled speculation that he could become the next Frankel or Black Caviar by making light work of his return to action at the Juddmonte International Stakes at York. He comfortably claimed the $750,000 first prize at the English venue's richest race of the season -- the same one where in 2012 Frankel won a record eighth consecutive Group One event. It was Australia's first run since late June, when he won the Irish Derby to add to his victory at the Epsom Derby earlier that month. ""He was ready for a racecourse gallop, that was where he was at,"" said O'Brien told reporters. ""His weight rose alarmingly in the last three weeks but the lads at home were very happy. He was a lot of kilos up on his Derby run -- he was 15-20 kilos heavier -- and that's a lot of weight. O'Brien's 21-year-old son Joseph -- who won the York race last year on Declaration of War -- had to drop considerable weight to continue his regular ride on Australia. ""I can't tell you the massive part Joseph plays,"" his father said. ""He can do 8 stone 12 pounds (56 kg) but we don't like him doing it. ""We're quite happy for him to put overweight up when he does. In the big days we want Joseph to be on and this is one of them."" Australia's physical development since the prestigious Epsom win was remarkable, according to O'Brien. ""Joseph said that leaving the paddock in the Derby he felt like he was a two- or three-year-old, but today leaving he felt like a five-year-old,"" he said. ""There's such prize-money here and it's such a prestigious race that it's very hard to gallop him at a racecourse rather than bring him here."" Next up, the O'Briens will likely return to their homeland with Australia for the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown on September 13, where the trainer has a leading seven career wins. ""The more we trained him when he came back, the heavier he got, and I'd imagine the run will leave him right,"" the 44-year-old said. ""I'll speak to the lads but hopefully he will go to Leopardstown. I'd love him to go there and get him back to Ireland."" Australia was sired by Galileo, who also won the Epsom Derby, Irish Derby and Irish Champion Stakes, while his mother is a two-time European Horse of the Year. He was ranked 10th in the Longines World's Best Racehorse list ahead of Wednesday's victory, with a rating of 123. Galileo, meanwhile, sired the top-three finishers at the International Stakes, with The Grey Gatsby second ahead of Telescope. Frankel, who retired unbeaten in 14 races in late 2012, was the world's top-ranked racehorse with a rating of 140 -- considered the best of all time. Champion Australian sprinter Black Caviar then took over from Frankel at the top last year before retiring undefeated in 25 races.","Australia wins third consecutive race at Juddmonte International Stakes .

"(CNN) -- Derbies often provide the highlight of any football season -- whether that be Boca Juniors vs. River Plate, AC Milan vs. Inter or Arsenal vs. Spurs -- and Major League Soccer (MLS) is now hoping that Los Angeles can join that illustrious list. For the hope for the city's new franchise, whose working title is simply Los Angeles Football Club, is that it can have an intense rivalry with four-time champions LA Galaxy. The first derby is scheduled to take place in 2017, when the club is set to enter the league. And it should be a high profile event if any of the illustrious co-owners, NBA legend Magic Johnson, U.S. football great Mia Hamm and her husband, Major League Baseball star, Nomar Garciaparra, attend. ""We feel strongly that this city cannot only support but will really thrive with two teams -- rivals on and off the field,"" said Don Garber, the MLS' long-standing commissioner. Garber's enthusiasm for the new franchise -- which also numbers motivational speaker Tony Robbins and controversial Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan among its diverse 22-person ownership group -- is seemingly limitless. ""This visionary ownership group will chart a course that will further elevate the sport in this great city and, combined with a new state-of-the-art stadium, accelerate us down the path toward becoming one of the top leagues in the world,"" he added. Yet the MLS is well aware of the need for caution given that Los Angeles FC's creation comes just three days after the city's former second club, Chivas, ceased operations following 10 years of existence. Set up in 2005 by Jorge Vergara, the owner of Mexican side Chivas de Guadalajara, and Mexico City businessman Antonio Cue, the American Chivas failed in its aim of tapping into the interest of LA's sizeable Hispanic community. The fact that the club ground-shared with Galaxy may have hindered its ability to establish its own identity, which might explain why a new stadium for Los Angeles FC is a leading priority. ""We believe this team can become one of the most outstanding clubs in the MLS and a globally-recognized brand,"" said the ownership group's leader, Henry Nguyen, in a statement. ""Today is day one and time for us to focus on developing a world-class stadium for the club to play in and for fans to enjoy."" MLS Commissioner Garber wholeheartedly agrees. ""There are four key elements to success in MLS soccer,"" he said. ""You need a community that loves the game, owners that are passionate about the league, and you need to have them be local - it's important for them to come from the community yet support that effort with resources from international investors, which is very much the case here. ""Lastly, we need to have a plan for a stadium, whether that is a large stadium downtown or a soccer stadium that we start from scratch."" ""We have all of those elements here."" In addition to uncertainty about the team's official name, prospective fans must also wait for confirmation of who will form the front office, coaching and administrative staff. What is known is that Peter Guber, who owns NGA's Golden State Warriors and co-owns Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers, will serve as executive chairman. Los Angeles FC's presence will make the MLS a 22-team league in 2017 with New York City FC, which is co-owned by English Premier League side Manchester City and baseball side New York Yankees, and Orlando City joining next season. Starting with ten teams in 1996, the MLS will thus double in size to 20 teams as it enter its 20th year.","Los Angeles Football Club will join MLS in 2017 .

"(CNN) -- After Brazilian midfielder Douglas Costa said he was ""afraid"" to return to Shakhtar Donetsk, the Ukrainian club located in a war zone announced that it would play its home games elsewhere. Shakhtar, Ukraine's top club and a regular in the Champions League, now plans on contesting its home matches in the western city of Lviv near the Polish border and will shift its training base to the capital, Kiev, from Donetsk. Shakhtar begins its league campaign with a ""home"" game Sunday against Metalurh Zaporizhya. Tensions between Russia and Ukraine were already running high but further escalated after MH17 was shot down near Donetsk in eastern Ukraine Thursday. The U.S. believes pro-Russian rebels shot down the plane, which the rebels deny, while Ukraine has accused Russia of involvement -- which Russia has also denied, blaming Ukraine's military for the tragedy. ""We will play all of our home games at the Arena Lviv so far,"" Shakhtar manager Mircea Lucescu told the club website after Tuesday's win over Dynamo Kiev in Lviv in the Ukrainian Super Cup. ""The team liked the city and the atmosphere here was great."" Lucescu didn't know when the team would resume home games at the Donbass Arena, which, like the Arena Lviv, staged games during Euro 2012, co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland. Costa is one of six South American players who refused to return to Shakhtar following a friendly in France. All six didn't play in the 2-0 victory against Dynamo. Writing on his Instagram page this week, Costa, who has previously been linked with Manchester United, insisted he wasn't ""abandoning"" the club but that ""in this moment we are all concerned (for) our lives."" He is now being linked with a loan move to the English Premier League or Italy's Serie A. Shakhtar president Rinat Akhmetov, meanwhile, said that if the players didn't come back, they would ""suffer"" while insisting the club would keep them safe. Captain Darijo Srna dedicated Tuesday's win to Shakhtar's fans. ""We know that our fans are with us,"" Srna, with Shakhtar since 2003, told the club website. ""This victory is for them, for Donbass, for all the people who are going through the hard war times. ""I do not know what to say. My heart hurts, my soul hurts. But we still try to show our football, the Shakhtar type. Trying to give a festival to all the fans of Shakhtar.

"(CNN)  --   The hotel that will be home to President-elect Barack Obama and his family for the next couple of weeks offers one of Washington's best views of their future home, the White House, and a past linked with political movers and shakers. The Obama family will check into the historic Hay-Adams hotel in Washington this weekend. The Obamas will be moving into the Hay-Adams hotel this weekend, aides say. They're doing this in part so that the family's daughters, Sasha and Malia, can begin school when classes reconvene after winter break. They had hoped to move earlier into nearby Blair House, which presidents-elect traditionally occupy five days before moving into the White House. But the Bush administration said the house, which is used as a guest house for visiting dignitaries, already had events scheduled there and guests who could not be displaced. The Obamas will move into Blair House on January 15. According to its Web site, the Hay-Adams takes its name from past residents of the site -- one of whom had close ties with Obama's favorite U.S. president, Abraham Lincoln. John Hay, a private assistant to Lincoln and later secretary of state, and Henry Adams, an author and descendent of presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, both lived on the site the hotel now occupies. The two, their wives and geologist Clarence King were a group of friends that dubbed themselves ""The Five of Hearts,"" going so far as to have china and stationary letterhead printed with the nickname. In 1884, Hay and Adams bought adjoining lots at the corner of 16th and H Streets, and their homes became Washington's leading salons. Their discussions of politics, literature, science and art attracted the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, Mark Twain and author Henry James. The homes were bought and razed in 1927, with the Italian Renaissance-style Hay-Adams House erected in their place at a cost of $900,000. It was bought by the Ieu family of Japan in 1989 and was closed from October 2001 to March 2002, during which time it underwent a $20 million renovation.

Its Web site advertises rooms with unobstructed views of the White House, St. John's Church and the square. Local legend holds that Henry Adams' wife, Clover, committed suicide in 1885 and now haunts the hotel. The story goes that she appears most frequently in December on the hotel's fourth floor.

"(CNN) -- It's become an increasingly precious jewel in the ATP's financial crown, attracting big crowds and treating the leading players like rock stars since its move to London four years ago. This week's World Tour Finals not only showcases the top 16 singles and doubles competitors, it also highlights the benefits the men's tennis showpiece can bring to a city. The question now is, can the UK capital continue its love affair with the tournament -- or will it continue its nomadic past? Before London was granted an extension to stage it until 2015, New York and Rio de Janeiro were other cities rumored to be in the running. The Big Apple, like London, is one of the globe's major metropolises and home to one of tennis' four grand slams. It hosted the ATP tournament in the late '70s and '80s in the heyday of Madison Square Garden. Brazil, meanwhile, is an emerging market that in the next three years will host soccer's World Cup, the Summer Olympics and a medium-sized tennis event in Rio. However, moving the event elsewhere would be a ""gamble,"" according to the former head of the ATP's commercial division, while Roger Federer -- whose record six finals wins are spread across London, Houston and Shanghai -- would have no issue with a further continuation. Tournament director Andre Silva says staying in Britain past 2015 is ""definitely"" a possibility. Unlike soccer's ruling body FIFA, which aims to take the World Cup to pastures new, the ATP's goal isn't to be ""evangelistic"" about tennis -- and London, with its packed crowds, has been a boon financially for the men's game. ""My personality isn't much for a change,"" Silva, a Brazilian, told CNN. ""This is a different animal to the World Cup in that it's year to year, and you do want to expose fans around the world to this type of tennis. ""But the tournament is a very important part of the business of the ATP. More important than exposing everyone around the world to it is making sure it's healthy and not an experiment. ""I know a lot of people talked about Rio and New York. It's obviously great to be wanted. At the same time you need to be sure it makes sense -- and right now London makes a lot of sense."" Federer, who lost to Novak Djokovic in last year's final, shared Silva's view. ""I must agree with Andre in many ways because I think it's important that this event is played in a place that knows tennis,"" Federer told CNN. ""I think it's good sometimes to play Shanghai, or maybe Lisbon or Sydney for a year, but I think it's not long enough in one place to put its roots down."" Lisbon welcomed the world's top players in 2000 and Sydney did the same in 2001 in another one-year stint. ""It's like a circus,"" said Federer, who will this week tie Ivan Lendl's record of 12 successive appearances at the season-ending event. ""You come, the tent is there but it's temporary and you move it away again. So here the roots are down, it's successful and that's why if the business makes sense, if the numbers make sense, if the excitement of everybody involved makes sense, I think we should keep it here. ""Other options would have to be considered but it would have to be a great other option."" Richard Davies, the CEO of ATP Properties before leaving his post at the end of 2010, said London was ""twice as successful"" in monetary value for the ruling body than other host cities. Unlike when the season finale was showcased in Shanghai as the Masters Cup, the World Tour Finals are operated as a joint venture between the ATP and London's O2 venue owner AEG. All operating costs and revenues feed into the joint venture. The Shanghai promoters paid the ATP for the right to run the tournament, and the purchasing fee -- believed to work out to about $10 million per year -- was all the latter received from the event. ""If there's no tennis fatigue at the O2 and it's still selling out, I think you have to ask yourself, 'What's the upside to move it elsewhere?' "" said Davies. ""At the ATP Tour, it's not their responsibility to be evangelistic about tennis. ""London is a great city and that helps corporately. You'd have to take a long, hard look to say, 'We're going to move it.' It's very profitable and to get a tennis-loving nation behind it in any other country at that time of the year will be a gamble."" The success of the tournament has had a knock-on effect on sponsorship, according to both Davies and Silva. Some companies get involved with the World Tour Finals and then decide to increase their affiliation with the tour throughout the year. More than one million fans have walked through the turnstiles in the four editions, helped by a capacity of 17,800 that makes the O2 arena the second-largest regularly used tennis venue behind New York's Arthur Ashe Stadium. Operating two sessions -- day and evening -- pads the coffers. Tickets to watch a single round-robin match range from Â£10-62 ($16-98), while seats for the final are Â£30-105 ($48-167). ""People want to be part of the event,"" said Silva. ""They see how successful it is. They see the tour operates in a very successful way throughout the year and end up becoming global partners."" Come the conclusion of 2015, London's term will hit seven consecutive seasons, a run only bettered by New York, which had an unbroken spell from 1977-1989. With tennis a younger sport in China, crowds for opening matches disappointed, the time zone presented problems for broadcasters and viewers in Europe -- tennis' biggest market -- while players faced the long trip to Asia following the European indoor swing. London lacks those issues, though players have complained about Britain's tax laws -- which restrict the number of days they can be in the country before being rated on their overall income. The O2 is ""one of the best venues ever"" according to veteran doubles specialist Leander Paes, this week teaming up with Radek Stepanek. ""Playing in there, the acoustics are phenomenal,"" Paes, who turned pro in 1991, told CNN. ""The crispness of it makes the quality of tennis so high."" Pondering the achievement of the event in London, Davies spared a thought for former ATP head Etienne de Villiers. De Villiers was criticized for implementing a round-robin format at smaller tournaments, and the ATP was taken to court during his 2005-08 tenure for attempting to strip a German event of Masters status. But De Villiers spearheaded the shift to London from Shanghai in 2009. ""People have short memories,"" said Davies. ""It was a very bold move. The O2 wasn't an established venue and it had a slight miasma about it. ""To back ourselves and say we know we can build an event here, find sponsors and fill it with an audience really that has just had Wimbledon, outdoors ... we're going to take that tennis-loving public and tell them to watch tennis indoors -- it was a big decision.""","London will host the season-ending championship of men's tennis until 2015 .

"(CNN) -- President Obama said he should have known better than to go golfing immediately after speaking about the beheading of an American journalist. In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Obama said he ""should have anticipated the optics"" because ""part of the job is the theater of it,"" conceding ""it's not something that comes naturally"" to him. Obama was vacationing in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, when Islamic militants released the gruesome video of James Foley, who was brutally killed as a payback for U.S. airstrikes against the terror group ISIS. Obama strongly condemned the killing, saying ""the entire world is appalled by the brutal murder of Jim Foley."" Minutes later, he was photographed golfing, which caused critics to accuse him of insensitivity. Obama said he was deeply affected by the beheading of the American journalist. ""After having talked to the families, where it was hard for me to hold back tears listening to the pain that they were going through,"" he said, ""I think everybody who knows me -- including, I suspect, the press -- understands that ... you take this stuff in. And it's serious business. And you care about it deeply."" The President said he understands ""optics"" is important. ""It matters. And I'm mindful of that."" At the same time, Obama conceded that the ""theater"" of the presidency is a challenge for him. ""You're followed everywhere. And the part of what I'd love is the vacation from the press.""

"(CNN) -- American entrepreneur Gene Haas is a great believer in the adage ""you've got to speculate to accumulate."" Which goes some way to explaining why he's prepared to enter the dollar-draining world of Formula One -- and expects to make money. Tthe 61-year-old NASCAR team owner has been motoring on with his plans to build his brand new Haas F1 Team from scratch to join the grid in 2016. As the founder of Haas Automation, he sees F1's global world championship as the perfect shop window for his billion dollar machine tool manufacturing business. ""If I can achieve an extra billion in sales, we will pay for whatever F1 costs,"" the Californian told CNN's The Circuit. ""Some teams spend half a billion, some spend 50 million dollars a year,"" as Haas did the maths. ""We should be somewhere in the middle of that."" Haas has taken note of Red Bull Racing's success in F1, a team that has won four straight world titles in the 10 years since Austrian tycoon Dietrich Mateschitz, the co-founder of the energy drink company, bought and revamped the Jaguar race team. ""Just the association of being with F1 basically takes a brand from nobody to the stratosphere,"" said Haas, whose team will be based in Kannapolis, North Carolina, though it will have an overseas office close to London, England. However, a concern for Haas must be that F1's most recent start-ups have enduring mixed fortunes. Of the three teams who joined F1 when the grid was expanded to 12 teams in 2010, only Caterham and Marussia remain in business. The Spanish HRT team quit the sport because of lack of funding at the end of 2012, while Caterham and Marussia are still battling to survive from the back of the grid, with the future of both teams far from certain. ""I think their biggest problem was trying to get to the grid so fast,"" argued Haas. ""For us we want to make sure that before the cars come for practice in January 2016, we will have that chassis hopefully completely assembled by November. ""We will spend a fair amount of time making sure we have the right spares, the right pit equipment, the right logistics, the right containers -- all the right things that takes us to get to the race."" Having started his own NASCAR team in 2003, Haas joined forces with three-time Sprint Cup champion Tony Stewart to form the successful Stewart-Haas Racing team in 2009. If NASCAR taught Haas anything it is that the right connections are essential to motorsport success. Hence his F1 team has already signed a technical partnership with Ferrari, the most successful team in the history of the sport. The agreement means the Italian marque will supply the Haas team with hybrid engines and gearboxes as well as general technical support. ""It's the people that you partner with,"" responds Haas, when asked what he learned from setting up his NASCAR team from the bottom up. ""Ferrari wanted to go beyond being just an engine supplier and they were going to help us with the basic structures of the car. ""It's an honor to have Ferrari help us in this way and we take all the help they can give us because you can't really get better than Ferrari."" Haas was at the Italian Grand Prix, where rumors also swirled about the concept of F1's major marques -- the likes of Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes and Red Bull -- running three-car teams, an idea that would potentially see minnows like the Haas F1 Team knocked off the grid. ""I'm ready for a Formula One with eight teams with three cars each,"" F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone told Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport in an interview: . But the implacable Haas says he is not worried that his eponymous F1 team won't have a place on the grid if Ecclestone's idea comes to fruition. ""We have a license, we will be there,"" Haas insisted. ""Unless something changes that would be a shock to me. ""I think Bernie's objective is to have teams who are well-structured, well-funded and that race at a level that the world championship requires."" So Haas continues to focus on overseeing the first American-based F1 team to compete at the elite level of global motorsport since 1986. A bid by the USF1 team to join the grid in 2010 ended ignominiously because of a lack of funding. American dream . F1 still lags behind the domestic NASCAR and IndyCar series when it comes to audience share. However the reintroduction of the U.S. Grand Prix in 2012 on a new circuit in Austin in 2012 has helped grow the sport's popularity. ""I tell ya, an American team with an American driver would be simply hitting it out of the ball park as far as the media would be concerned,"" enthused Haas. ""We would love to do that but it's a bit too early to try and predict that. It would be great to have fellow Americans behind us and supporting us, that would be a tremendous push for us."" If winning over homegrown motorsport fans is a long-term aim -- not to forget the plans to double the turnover of the Haas business -- then the short-term goal for the Californian car enthusiast is much more prosaic. ""The first five years is about just surviving,"" Haas says. ""I don't have any grander expectations that we are going to go there and win championships. ""If we can even win one race in five years that would be a tremendous success."" Given Marussia have only won two points -- thanks to stricken driver Jules Bianchi's ninth-place finish in Monaco this season -- and Caterham are yet to score a point, a grand prix victory for the Haas F1 Team would be success indeed. Hammer time . Don't bet against it happening though with Haas at the helm. ""I've been tinkering with cars most of my life, since I was 10 years old,"" adds Haas. ""I always had this flavor, this attitude 'yeah I think I can do that a little bit better.' ""I just never give up and keep trying, trying and trying. I just keep hammering away. ""If you keep doing something long enough, you learn how to do it and I don't think F1 is any different. ""It's just a challenge. Certainly the biggest challenge of my career but I don't have any doubts we can do it. You just don't give up.""","Gene Haas wants to bolster business brand by founding a Formula One team .

"(CNN) -- Bigger and better than before -- that's the promise as the NFL International Series returns to London this weekend, and hopes are rising that Britain will one day have its own permanent franchise. Wembley Stadium will host American football's overseas showpiece for the eighth year running and, for the first time, the home of English soccer will welcome three regular-season games, spread over the next six weeks. Building on the two games it held last year and the one it hosted initially, overseas fans will get a rare glimpse of the United States' most popular sport. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed as early as February that the games had already sold out, meaning 270,000 spectators will witness the Oakland Raiders take on the Miami Dolphins, the Detroit Lions face the Atlanta Falcons and the Jacksonville Jaguars play the Dallas Cowboys. Why is the NFL staging games in England? It's all about growing the sport abroad and attracting more fans worldwide. The league has a long history of trying to extend its borders, dating back to 1952 when the Fuerstenfeldbruck Eagles defeated the Burtonwood Bullets in the ""United States Air Forces in Europe"" game at the old Wembley Stadium. The NFL made major strides when launching the ""American Bowl"" in 1986 -- a series of preseason exhibition games at Wembley, which soon expanded to include Tokyo, Montreal, Berlin, Barcelona, Dublin, Mexico City, Toronto, Monterrey, Vancouver, Sydney and Osaka. That kept running until 2005, when Goodell announced the league would replace it with the NFL International Series -- the key difference being that matches would now be regular-season games rather than just exhibitions. And following on from 2005's ""Futbol Americano"" in Mexico -- the first regular-season game to be held outside the U.S. -- the maiden International Series was staged at Wembley in 2007, with the New York Giants beating Miami Dolphins, and it has been held there every year since. It will continue to do so until at least 2016. ""When we heard we were accepted to play this game we were all excited about it, just the opportunity to come to London and to play a game that's growing each and every year and to be part of it is a wonderful feeling for us,"" Detroit Lions linebacker Stephen Tulloch told CNN ahead of his side's game against the Falcons on October 26. Has the series proved to be a success? The NFL has gone from strength to strength in the United Kingdom since 2007, as television ratings continue to grow, while more and more youngsters are getting involved with the sport. The International Series does not just stop with the action at Wembley, though, as a whole host of activities are organized in the buildup to the matches, including the award-winning ""NFL on Regent Street."" Almost 600,000 people packed London's famous thoroughfare last year as the street turned into a fan festival for the day. ""It's an incredible experience,"" said Dallas Cowboys cornerback Brandon Carr of his time in London ahead of the November 9 clash against the Jaguars. ""The weather is beautiful, the experience so far is incredible, it's a great opportunity to come out here and represent my organization and the NFL."" But with the NFL bandwagon and Goodell himself arriving in London under a cloud after the Ray Rice scandal, the league will be more determined than ever for the International Series to run smoothly. How does the Wembley experience compare to U.S. NFL games? What's so unique about the International Series is that it allows fans access to a sport they may not often have the chance to experience live. According to the NFL, only 3% of fans at recent games have been Americans. ""I hear the atmosphere in the stadium and the environment is similar to a Super Bowl experience,"" Carr adds. ""I was at the Super Bowl as a fan in New Orleans and I know the level of electricity and excitement in the air. And I know once the teams start rolling into town, this is going be pretty exciting around here both for the players and the fans."" Who are the home teams and who are the away teams in the NFL International Series? The Jaguars, the Raiders and the Falcons are this year's hosts. The Jaguars were the home side last year -- losing to the San Francisco 49ers -- and will be until 2016, having become the first team to make a multi-year commitment to playing in the series, replacing the St. Louis Rams, who backed out of a similar deal in 2012. Teams that give up a home game in the U.S. to play in London are often sides that have struggled in attracting supporters to their own stadiums, and so are enticed by the financial incentives of hosting matches overseas. A ""home team"" can make the trip abroad every year for up to five years, while an ""away team"" can only make the same journey once every five years. ""Every year there's a few games you look forward to,"" said Miami Dolphins defensive end Cameron Wake ahead of Sunday's game against the Raiders. ""Obviously this is one."" ""I knew right before I joined the Dolphins, in 2007 they came over here, so I figured we had a couple of years to wait to be picked again. So I'm glad it's this year and I know a lot of guys in the locker room feel the same way."" The idea of using certain regular sides as ""home teams"" was one proposed by Goodell in an effort to build an overseas fan base for those sides and to ultimately raise the prospect of a permanent NFL team in the United Kingdom. So Britain so may get an NFL franchise? One day, that could certainly be the case. NFL bosses are believed to be satisfied with the league's current 32-team model, and would prefer an existing side to make the move to London, rather than creating a new franchise. The Jaguars are reported to be the most likely team to be relocated, given their current agreement to play multiple games in London and that owner Shahid Khan also runs London soccer team Fulham. Surely the logistics are a nightmare? The Atlantic could prove to be a stumbling block. There does, however, seem to be a growing belief in the world of NFL that the teams can make this work. ""Obviously there's travel (which is a problem). You could maybe play games here, have an off-week, being able to travel to the States, maybe stay in the States for a little bit longer to play some teams in the States and then come back,"" Detroit's Tulloch proposes. ""After having three games that are sold out in London this year, it's just a matter of time (until a UK franchise is a reality)."" ""Maybe it's still some years down the road, but this is the way the NFL has evolved,"" Dallas' Carr adds. ""The direction the game has taken, we're getting fans from all over and hopefully we can make the step in this direction and allow the fans to regularly just feel and see the passion that we have for this game.""","The NFL International Series is back in London this weekend .

""It's the first time I've killed anybody,"" Leboeuf reveals to CNN, reflecting on a dramatic career switch -- and also recent reversal in his new life as an actor. ""It's a change as I've been killed a couple of times. Thankfully, Leboeuf's victim is fictional and, rather than a new life as his character Marcel Deville, a member of the French resistance, the former Chelsea defender is reflecting on a new career on the silver screen in the movie Allies. From day one, football and film were his two great passions, and both consumed him with equal force. ""The posters on my wall were Michel Platini and Jean Tigana alongside Sean Connery and Jean-Paul Belmondo,"" he recalls, referring to two French football greats, a former James Bond and one of France's great cinematic heroes. ""I think my first passion when I was younger was shared with my mother... the movies. ""I loved watching plays as well but there wasn't much chance to pursue that in a small French village but my father created a football academy in our village and that was it."" Each day, be it returning home from school or football training, the first thing he would do -- even before removing his coat -- was to plant himself in front of the television and watch a movie. ""It's like two careers isn't it? One for my father, one for my mother, both for me,"" said the 46-year-old as he talks about the opportunity to pursue his two great loves. Leboeuf is also currently treading the boards in French theater with a role in Ma Belle-Mere, Mon Ex et Moi (My Mother-in-law, My Ex and Me), a comedy in which he plays the role of the straight man. ""The similarity with both is that I always complain about performance in both,"" said Leboeuf as he talks about the demands of professional sport and acting. ""After a match, even if we won I'd be unhappy about a missed pass. After a play, I'll be like 'I was s***' or else think how I didn't deliver a line properly. Having earned 50 caps for France and man-marked Brazilian striker Ronaldo out of the 1998 World Cup final, Leboeuf is candid enough to admit an actor's life doesn't quite give him the same adrenalin rush he experienced as a footballer. ""Films are not the same as it's a slow process and the theater is different as it's not like playing in front of 90,000 people. ""In this play, I have to deliver a line for the funny man and it has to be right or else his subsequent line isn't funny as it doesn't make sense. ""So there's that pressure to deliver which is maybe the same in football. You have to be precise."" His big break as a thespian came when he was still on Chelsea's books in 2001. Ronnie Harwood, who won the Oscar for best adapted screenplay for another World War II film The Pianist in 2002, approached him to get involved in a film version of his play Taking Sides. The chance to act alongside Harvey Keitel and Stellan Skarsgard, planted the thought in Leboeuf's that he might pursue an acting career when his footballing forays were over. In 2005, he relocated to Los Angeles for acting classes and he still has a home there. It was while on holiday in the United States that he received a script for Allies, having to deliver his audition via his iPhone with his wife. To his surprise he bagged the part. ""I never thought I'd get the part as it seemed like a bad job but I got a call to say that Dominic [Burns, the director] wanted me in the movie."" Leboeuf is not the first French footballer to have pursued an acting profession after hanging up his boots, with the former Chelsea defender following in the footsteps of Eric Cantona. The ex-Manchester United star's English-speaking roles include a part as a French aristocrat in the 1998 movie Elizabeth, which was nominated for seven Oscars, and more recently in Ken Loach's Looking for Eric about a postman who hallucinates that his idol, Cantona, follows him and gives him advice. ""I don't know him,"" admitted Leboeuf. ""I played against him at the end of his career when I was at Chelsea and we played in the national team, one of the last times he played for the team. ""I know his younger brother better but not him but I've still followed his career. ""There's obviously a parallel between what we're doing, and he's a great example of how to be a success from football to acting."" He might have won the World Cup and European Championship with France as well as six trophies for Chelsea, but Leboeuf is clearly a man that looks ahead rather than to his past successful sporting career. So much so that that his World Cup winners medal was in the glove box of his car for a year until his son unearthed it. A player who arrived in London in 1996 as a relative unknown on English shores for a fee of £2.5 million from Strasbourg to become a fans' favorite, Leboeuf still describes himself as ""Chelsea's No.1 fan."" ""I don't get to Stamford Bridge to watch as much as I might like. I had to miss the Chelsea-Maribor match on TV the other night as I was on stage but the first thing I do as I come off stage is to check the scores."" His beloved Chelsea are currently top of the Premier League in England and are top of Group G in the Champions League. ""For me, at the beginning of the season, I felt the Premier League would be between Chelsea and Manchester City, and I believe it to be the same,"" he adds. ""Of course, it would be more desirable if it's Chelsea and they look good, and in the Champions League too. Of course, yes, the Double is possible. ""Jose Mourinho had asked to be given a year to get the squad he wanted and to deliver,"" added Leboeuf, referring to the Chelsea manager. ""Mourinho desperately wants to win the Champions League for Chelsea and he has put himself under pressure to do that. He wants to do that to add to the Chelsea legend."" In his own way, Leboeuf was one too, even if the Stamford Bridge faithful, however, might struggle to recognize him in his current guise.

"(CNN) -- Not content with claiming every major club honor with Chelsea and over a century of caps for England -- now Frank Lampard is relishing a new challenge in MLS with New York City FC. ""Obviously players tend to come here later in their careers, but for me personally I come here with a big determination to make an imprint on life here,"" he told CNN. ""I made this move because I wanted to come here and do well."" The 36-year-old Lampard had a host of offers to prolong his career in the English Premier League or in Europe, but has opted for the Big Apple and the new franchise which starts in the 2015 season. ""It feels really right,"" he said. ""For me personally it's a great challenge to move from Chelsea to a different country and a great city like New York."" Lampard left Chelsea as a club legend, having scored a record 211 goals in 649 appearances over 13 seasons. During that time he helped the Blues to three EPL titles, the English FA Cup on four occasions and the crowning glory, the 2012 European Champions League crown. But last season it became clear that his Chelsea career was drawing to a close with manager Jose Mourinho looking to younger players. Lampard said that he was not ruling out a future role at Chelsea but was ""totally committed"" to New York City FC. ""I'm sure there is the possibility to go back later in some capacity,"" he said. ""But I wanted to keep playing regularly and being important in a team."" Lampard, who has signed a two-year contact with New York, joins former Spanish international David Villa as the marquee players in the new venture. Before signing a one-year extension to his Chelsea contract before the start of last season, Lampard had mulled over a move to Los Angeles Galaxy, the then club of his former England teammate David Beckham. ""I have been watching the MLS since the Beckham's and (Robbie) Keane arrived,"" he said. ""The league has improved and its the perfect fit for me in football and lifestyle terms."" Lampard's last action as an England player saw him take to the field in its final group match at the 2014 World Cup, a draw with Costa Rica, but having already been eliminated. It was his 106th international cap with 29 goals to his name, an excellent scoring rate for a midfield player. New York City FC sporting director Claudio Reyna described Lampard as ""one of the greatest players over the last 15 years"" at his official unveiling Thursday and had worked hard to persuade him to make the move. ""New York sold me the vision of what they wanted to do,"" Lampard said. ""I think when I look back at the end of my career with Chelsea it's a period as good as it could be. ""I have no regrets,"" he added.","Frank Lampard joining New York City FC .

"(CNN) -- Can crowdfunding help an iconic team return to the Formula One grid after a 20-year hiatus? That's the aim for the family of the late three-time world champion Sir Jack Brabham, whose eponymous team still roars with resonance through motorsport history. In 1966, the Australian conjured a unique feat in F1 history when, at the age of 40, he became the only man to win the driver and team world titles with a car of his own make. All in all, the Brabham team engineered two constructor titles and four driver crowns -- with Brabham in 1967, Denny Hulme in 1968 and Nelson Piquet in 1981 and 1983 -- and was owned by F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone for much of the 1970s and 1980s. Inspired by Sir Jack's ingenuity and get-up-and-go attitude, his family have now launched Project Brabham. Its first aim is simple -- to bring the famous marque back to motorsport for the first time since 1992 with the help of its fans. ""Brabham sits alongside Ferrari, McLaren and Lotus because of what dad achieved,"" David Brabham, Sir Jack's youngest son, tells CNN. ""If you look at the history and heritage and what it means to people, a Brabham should really be out there -- racing is in our DNA."" Project Brabham is relying on this affection for the Brabham brand as it seeks to raise an initial $400,000 through crowdfunding. Donations start at just $1.60 and climb to $16,000 for a VIP experience, which includes a one-on-one on-track driving lesson from former F1 racer David. ""Crowdfunding is definitely a new and exciting way of generating funds"" he says. ""It gives us the seed money to get the project up and running but it also gives people an avenue to start being involved in the team."" Crowdfunding makes it easier for smaller companies and start-ups to raise capital by reaching potential new investors via online platforms. A quick cash injection would be a lifeline for struggling F1 teams Caterham and Marussia. It was reported at the weekend that both teams will not race in the upcoming U.S. and Brazilian Grand Prix because of a lack of funds. Could crowdfunding be the answer to ensuring independent race teams -- which operate without the financial clout of major brands such as Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull -- stay on the grid? ""F1 teams spend a hell of a lot of money trying to succeed and we know there are a lot of teams in trouble financially just trying to survive,"" says Brabham. ""I think that's more to do with the model and how they go about their business in that environment. You have to make sure that the model you're selling is sustainable. ""Project Brabham is using a different model because if we went down the same road as everyone else we'd have the same problems. ""We've already got commercial partners coming to talk to us because they can see the benefits of this different model."" Radical ideas . Project Brabham also aims to give as well as receive. The second radical ethos of the scheme is to lay bare the workings of a race team for the benefit of fans and future motorsport professionals alike. ""Do you start up a race team like everyone else or do you go racing in a different way and show what we're doing and how we're doing it?"" asks Brabham. ""We're setting out to give the fans access as well as educating drivers and engineers because you learn so much in this environment. ""It opens up any sort of problems that people have, instead of hiding stuff. I've been involved in teams where a lot of politics has got in the way of success. ""Being open and transparent doesn't exist [in motorsport] but I think it will give us an advantage. ""We're already communicating with our followers, we are already asking them, 'what do you think about this, what do you think about that.' ""We want to hear what they've got to say and they already feel like they are part of the team development."" The first phase of Project Brabham is to raise enough capital to run a Brabham team in the World Endurance Championship for sports cars in 2015. The crowdfunding target is set at an initial $400,000 but for Brabham to find a factory and buy its first car it has a more realistic goal of $4 million in mind. A return to F1 -- where teams can spend $1 million a day -- for Brabham after a 22-year hiatus may seem like a pipedream, but not for the determined Brabham family. ""Our ultimate goal is to get the Brabham name back in Formula One,"" David explains. ""It's in our DNA and it's where Brabham really should be, but it's one step at a time. ""Our model wouldn't work in F1 in an open and transparent way now, but 10 years down the road it could be a completely different story and, if it is, we want to be back in F1."" A new generation . It is not only the Brabham team that could be back on the grid -- Sir Jack's 20-year-old grandsons Sam and Matthew are also out to put the famous Brabham name back in the driving seat. Matthew is the 2013 champion in the North American Star Mazda open-wheeled championship and a reserve driver for 1978 F1 champion Mario Andretti's team in the Formula E championship, while Sam races in Formula Ford in the UK. ""We haven't raced each other,"" says Matthew of the pair's budding rivalry. ""But whether it be putting pillow cases on pillows or playing basketball, I always try and beat him. I can't lose to him!"" Sam agrees, adding: ""Yeah, competition runs in the family at absolutely anything!"" But do the third generation of Brabham racers -- who are following their fathers, uncle and grandfather onto the racetrack -- feel any pressure? ""It's more of an honor and something I take pride in,"" says Sam. Matthew adds: ""If anything maybe there's less pressure as our family understand how racing works and how much pressure drivers put on themselves. ""Maybe there is pressure from the family name and trying to live up to expectations but I just see my grandfather as my grandfather and my dad as my dad, so I don't see it that way."" With the ambitions of Project Brabham and a third generation of racing talent, is there a chance we could one day see a Brabham racing a Brabham in F1? ""The goal is to eventually have Brabham back in Formula One,"" says Sam with a smile. ""I think that would be massive, I think people would take to it -- and we've got two drivers here who wouldn't mind doing it as well!""","Project Brabham aims to bring back the Brabham team to motorsport .

"(CNN) -- Could there be an American team in Formula One for the first time in more than 25 years? NASCAR team co-owner Gene Haas has thrown his hat into the ring to enter a new team into the F1 world championship. Last month the sport's governing body, the FIA, asked prospective entrants to make ""an expression of interest"" to join the grid as a 12th team for the start of the 2015 or 2016 season. Haas, who co-owns Stewart-Haas Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, said Friday that he has answered the call. ""We have responded to the FIA's 'call for expression of interest' regarding a Formula One entry on behalf of Haas Racing Development,"" the American businessman said in a statement. ""We respect the FIA's evaluation process and will share more details in the coming weeks."" Haas has already tasted success in the premier U.S. racing series when the Stewart-Haas Team, which he founded with three-time Sprint Cup champion driver Tony Stewart, won the 2011 Sprint Cup Series championship. F1 last expanded the grid in 2010 when three new teams joined. Of the trio, two are still racing in their current guises -- Caterham and Marussia. The Spanish Hispania (HRT) team withdrew from the sport at the end of 2012 because of financial difficulties. The last U.S. backed team ran a limited number of races during the 1985 and 1986 seasons under the Lola-Hart moniker. Other American teams to enter the sport include Eagle, which debuted in 1966, Shadow and Penkse, both of which raced in the 1970s. The USF1 team launched an unsuccessful bid to join F1 for the 2010 season after difficulties securing financial backing. The FIA had given parties interesting in joining F1 until January 3 2014 to register their interest but it is not yet known whether there are any other prospective entries.","NASCAR co-owner registers interest in entering a new team in Formula One .

"(CNN) -- The surviving pilot of Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo told authorities he was unaware the feather system had been unlocked early by his co-pilot. The spaceship disintegrated 45,000 feet above the Mojave Desert on October 31, killing co-pilot Michael Tyner Alsbury and injuring co-pilot Peter Siebold, who managed to parachute to the ground. Siebold was interviewed last week by the National Transportation Safety Board. He described being ""extracted from the vehicle as a result of the break-up sequence and unbuckled from his seat at some point before the parachute deployed automatically,"" according to a release from the NTSB. Earlier this month, the NTSB tweeted that Alsbury ""moved the lock/unlock handle into unlock position."" ...the copilot, who was in right seat, moved the lock/unlock handle into unlock position; he did not survive accident. #SpaceShipTwo .

"(CNN) -- A triumphant Lewis Hamilton called Sunday's United States Grand Prix the best race of 2012 but for many it was more important than that -- it was Formula One being reborn in the USA. Since the sport abandoned the U.S. in 2007 it has been a long road back -- but a journey F1 desperately needed to make as a global sport, especially with the bizarre 2005 race still fresh in some minds. Yet its first job of finding a new home was fraught with frustration. After the Indianapolis Motor Speedway lost its contract to host F1, the Texan city of Austin successfully bid to stage the race on a purpose-built track. But less than a year ago, the chances of a race being held at all looked like they had bitten the nearby desert dust. Workers at the Circuit of the Americas (COTA) had downed tools and the deal with F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone was off. ""It came pretty close to being canceled,"" Kevin Olsen, co-founder with sister Kerri of The Austin Grand Prix website, told CNN. ""There were high stake negotiations between COTA and Mr Ecclestone -- who was going to pay and how much. They'd already spent $100m on excavation and infrastructure. Nobody could believe they'd let this go."" 'Dirt and nothing' On December 6, Ecclestone eventually re-signed a contract with the circuit, which had secured extra funding through Texan businessmen Bobby Epstein and Red McCombs. After 21 days of torpor, a frantic period of construction began to get the circuit ready in time for the grand prix. ""It wasn't long ago that it was dirt and nothing out there,"" recalled Blake Widmore, an Austin sous chef who lives on a 150-acre property just 30 yards from the circuit's hairy uphill first turn. ""It was just pasture. It might have been used for cattle. Then there was a lot of construction but it's been pretty cool to watch it grow."" The circuit received an official seal of approval in September but 12 miles away, pockets of downtown Austin remained unsure about F1. Walking around the city a fortnight ago, there was a general feeling that the laid back state capital -- which prides itself on its live music -- was blithely unaware of what was about to roll into town. ""I've said for a long time that this city had no idea what was coming,"" agreed Dave Doolittle, the F1 correspondent for the Austin Statesman newspaper. ""There's also a part of this town whose criticism of F1 is based on a misunderstanding of it -- there's an element that doesn't think it's very cool."" Despite those reservations, Austin embraced F1 over the GP weekend with Texan bonhomie, barbeques and what amounted to a 24-hour festival of live music in downtown's throbbing hub. ""Austin is already on the map, we're the live music capital of the world,"" enthused Andy from Austin's Oak Hill area. ""Now we're going to be the U.S. Grand Prix capital of the world."" The fans aside, the Hermann Tilke-designed circuit has also satiated the drivers' demands for on-track thrills with its elevation changes and high-speed curves. ""The change of direction is faster than Silverstone and that's saying something,"" opined McLaren's Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion. ""It's fantastic."" On Sunday, the course staged an intense and intoxicating race, the result of which deliciously sent the 2012 title decider to the final grand prix in Brazil. The event also saw 117,500 fans -- just 2,500 shy of the circuit capacity -- turn out for a GP on U.S. soil, with many attending for the first time. ""I've never experienced a race in my entire life,"" said Jocelyn Floretta from St Louis, Missouri. ""It was absolutely amazing. ""How fast the cars go is so mind-boggling. They just put on such a spectacular show. We had no problems, it's been very unstressful."" Marketing opportunity . For the teams and sponsors, the lure of the U.S. market has also set pulses racing -- a five-year absence from the world's second largest car market has been agony for those who are anxious to promote their brands in difficult financial times. ""We're delighted that, after five years, F1 is back in the States,"" said Mercedes vice-president Norbert Haug. ""This is very, very important. ""It is the biggest market for our premium cars and our colleagues over here will use this event over a long period of time to support our sales initiatives."" There are even opportunities for teams with non-motoring products to market, such as Red Bull who sell most of their energy drinks in the U.S. But while the city, the circuit, the racing and the shop window it provides have all trumpeted F1's return to the U.S., it must still do more if it is to conquer America. Many Americans still consider the sport, which trails behind domestic series Nascar and IndyCar in audience share, to be elitist. ""It's been an odd relationship with F1,"" said IndyCar icon Dario Franchitti, who was in Austin to watch his cousin Paul di Resta drive for the Force India team. ""There's a core of hardcore F1 fans in America but the mainstays are Nascar and IndyCar. Generally nobody worried about it and F1 didn't really worry about America. It needed a facility like this to bring it all together."" Like others in the Austin paddock, the Scotsman also believes F1 should do more to embrace its fans. ""IndyCar is more accessible, our paddock is more open, you buy a ticket and you can all get in,"" Franchitti added. ""Off the track, the public are used to having more access so they want that [in F1]."" Many feel an American driver and race team are also essential to build and sustain F1's presence in the U.S. The country has produced two world champions in Phil Hill (1961) and Mario Andretti (1978) but Californian Scott Speed was the last American to compete in F1 and it's been five years since he lost his Toro Rosso seat to reigning title-holder Sebastian Vettel. An approved entry for a new U.S.-based marque, when the grid was expanded in 2010, ended ignominiously with the collapse of the USF1 team because of a lack of funding. ""Americans are very patriotic and they want someone to support,"" said Alexander Rossi, Caterham F1 team's U.S.-born reserve driver who is targeting a race seat in 2014. ""In order to entice more fans, and to allow F1 to compete with Nascar and IndyCar, there needs to be an American driver."" The future . Haug added to the theory: ""I would like to see a step-by-step approach: first, one successful event; then a second one; and ultimately an American driver. ""Hopefully we will also see an American team, like Penske in the past or like Dan Gurney's Eagles, which won the Belgian Grand Prix in 1967 with the all-American car of the All American Racers."" When asked how he might promote the F1 brand further in the U.S., Ecclestone replied: ""Have maybe 10 races like we have in Europe."" A new GP in New Jersey, which lost its place on the 2013 calendar because of money troubles, is penciled in for 2014. Broadcaster NBC, who are the new U.S. rights holders to F1 from 2013, also plan to build a bigger audience by expanding coverage on its mainstream sports channel. ""It's not like in Europe where the mass population understands what the sport is,"" argued Button, who spends time training in Hawaii and California. ""I was running in Malibu recently and a couple of people were like 'Jenson Button' and I thought 'Wow, that's amazing.' It will change. We'll get more people into the sport. ""Having it in Austin, a young, vibrant city should help attract a young audience but also get Americans more involved, actually wanting to work within the sport because that's the real way F1 is going to grow in America.""","Sunday's Grand Prix in Austin ended the sport's five-year absence from the United States .

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly four years into his speakership, John Boehner is stronger than ever. Boehner will be elected to his third term as Speaker on Thursday, a few days before his 66th birthday. He's already facing post-election grumbling from conservatives, but his position is remarkably secure for a Speaker whose tenure has been marked by the drama of the debt ceiling standoff, the government shutdown and the battles within the GOP. The Ohio Republican will soon preside over the largest House GOP majority since World War II and have a new partner in the Senate when Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, becomes majority leader. Boehner will still confront plenty of challenges as he shifts from being the face of the opposition party in Congress to a leader aiming to prove Republicans can govern ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Conservatives say they are worried that Boehner and McConnell may put too much emphasis on proving they can make a dysfunctional Congress work without focusing enough on laying out an agenda that sets up a clear contrast with Democrats. Kansas GOP Rep. Tim Huelskamp, a frequent Boehner critic from the right, told CNN that the midterm elections were a mandate for change and ""change wasn't compromise with the president."" He said ""what won the election in 2014 was bold conservative principles and solutions."" Social conservatives . Huelskamp said he agrees with Boehner's pledge to again pass a series of GOP economic measures next year that the Democratic-led Senate ignored. But he insisted that the GOP base also wants to see a Republican Congress take measures backed by social conservatives, and he cited ""traditional marriage and pro-life bills."" Boehner and McConnell, meanwhile, have largely stayed away from talking about social issues. ""If they define success as passing bills that the president signs, that is setting themselves up for failure over the next year,"" said Dan Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action, a conservative group that has clashed with Boehner in the past. Holler said the list of economic items that the two Republican leaders listed in their op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal last week was on target, but viewed by conservatives as just ""a good start."" The expanded GOP majority will give the Speaker a bit of a cushion so he can push back against the band of House conservatives who thwarted his legislative strategy and pushed the House to shut down the government last fall. Over the last four years, the Speaker has reminded his own members who wanted bolder action that he faced limits on what he could do because he only controlled ""one half of one third of the government."" ""Most of us were tired of hearing 'this is all Harry Reid will agree to' - that's so 2014,"" Huelskamp said, referring to the current Senate majority leader. Opposing Boehner . Other Boehner critics already plan to vote against him serving another term. A small group of GOP candidates who were elected last Tuesday night campaigned on the pledge they would oppose Boehner remaining Speaker. But the movement isn't big enough or sufficiently organized to cause any serious trouble. There is an effort, backed by Boehner allies, to get those who oppose him to do so behind closed doors on Thursday. This would avoid the embarrassment he endured in 2013 when live C-Span cameras showed a dozen House Republicans voting for someone else or skipping the vote on the House floor when Boehner began his second term. Huelskamp is one of those who publicly opposed Boehner two years ago. Boehner stripped him of his seat on the Budget committee after a series of splits with GOP leaders in 2012. Huelskamp told CNN ""the Speaker and I have our disagreements"" but that he planned to vote for him this time. He said he spoke with the Speaker recently, but declined to describe the ""private discussion."" The problem for those in the anti-Boehner crowd is they don't have an alternative candidate. Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling, who is popular among many conservatives and considered a leadership bid, decided he wanted to remain in his current post as the chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. It is true that some of the new House Republicans are just as conservative -- if not more so -- than the members they replaced. But several House Republicans and leadership aides all say that numerically ""it's a wash"" in terms of how big of a group of rabble rousers Boehner can expect to deal with in the next Congress. Many of those in the right wing of the GOP conference who split with Boehner were fueled by support and encouragement from outside groups. But these groups lost a lot of their clout and credibility after the spending confrontation they demanded led to the shutdown, which Boehner warned would damage the GOP's message . After the surprise defeat of Boehner's former number two - Eric Cantor - who many viewed as his only possible successor, Boehner has worked to solidify his power. Boehner spent most of the summer and fall months traversing the country campaigning for Republican candidates and collecting political chits. He visited 175 cities and remained the top House GOP fundraiser - - bringing in a whopping $102 million for GOP candidates from his various political committees. 'Strong position to persuade' Boehner is ""in a strong position to persuade,"" Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole told CNN. As a 24 year veteran of the House who once served as the Chair of the House Education Committee, Boehner is an institutionalist. He and McConnell are both masters of the behind the scenes legislative maneuvering that is little noticed by the public, but can lead to important deals. It's still unclear how willing Boehner will be to give any major concessions and work with the president and Democrats to pass items like new infrastructure programs and new trade authority. There's a sense that corralling what can sometimes be a rambunctious House GOP conference is a job that no one else besides Boehner is prepared to take on at this point -- or even wants. When Republicans gather this week, Boehner is likely to walk a fine line between telling his members what they want to hear about pushing conservative legislation next year, while starting to set some expectations. Those who have split with the Speaker say their disagreements have never been personal, and he's earned genuine respect. Many enjoy it when he leads the infamous ""Boehner birthday song,"" a fun, very short ditty members use to mark birthdays and now share on Twitter. ""Who else has a birthday song that everyone sings? He's clearly endeared and ingrained himself in a way that's quite unprecedented,"" Cole told CNN.","House GOP will elect Boehner speaker on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- A young black man runs with the ball at his feet, living out his dream of playing on the world stage. Around him, amidst an intimidating, vicious atmosphere, the noises begin. First, the boos, then the monkey noises. The incessant chanting, the vitriolic abuse, the gestures and then, the indignity of receiving punishment for having the temerity to stand your ground. Welcome to Serbia 2012, or should that be Bristol 1909? Racism row shines light on Serbian football . At first glance, Walter Tull, an officer in the British Army during the First World War and England Under-21 footballer Danny Rose appear to have little in common. Rose is a successful Premier League footballer, at the start of a promising career, which he hopes will see him become a full international. Before he was killed in the Great War, Tull was a pioneering black footballer, who blazed a trail for black stars of the future such as Brendan Batson, Laurie Cunningham, Viv Anderson and Cyril Regis. One man is on our television screen with pictures being sent around the world, the other has no grave, only an inscription on the memorial wall at the Fauborg-Amiens war cemetery and memorial at Arras. Black pioneer . But Tull's story, recorded some 93 years ago, could not be more apt given what Rose was forced to endure in Krusevac. While most were left stunned by Rose being sent off for his reaction to being targeted by racist chanting, the tale is all too familiar for those who know their history. Tull became the first black outfield player to to compete in the top-flight of the English league after signing for Tottenham Hotspur in 1909. Like Rose, he too suffered racial abuse from the stands with his career almost disappearing from history and public consciousness. Lazio hit by UEFA racism fine . That it didn't is largely thanks to two men, writer and producer Phil Vasili and director David Thacker, who are taking Tull's story to the stage and eventually the big screen. While the film surrounding Tull's life is scheduled to coincide with 2014's 100th anniversary of the Great War, the play will open in February in Bolton. ""I think the play will be very topical,"" said Vasili, author of the biography Walter Tull, 1888-1918: Officer, Footballer. ""It's quite poignant that the play should start so soon given what happened to Rose in Serbia. ""What happened to Rose, happened to Walter around 93 years previously and both were victimized twice. ""Rose was racially abused and then sent off, Walter was also abused before being dropped by Tottenham and eventually sold. ""Both men were punished twice. It's funny how something which happened nearly a century ago could be so relevant."" Terry decides against appealing FA racism verdict . If it wasn't for Vasili's work the story of the man who changed the face of football for black Britons could have been confined to the scrapheap of history. Although Arthur Wharton, a goalkeeper from Ghana, was the first professional black player to have competed at the top level in England, it is Tull who is credited with being a pioneer as he was the first black outfield player. Giant strides . Initially Vasili's attempts to get publishers or media outlets interested in Tull's story appeared to hit a dead end. ""I first came across him in 1993 and there was nothing contemporary about him, he had almost become forgotten,"" Vasili recalled. ""In the first years, I couldn't get anyone interested in it. Over time, the interest has grown and he's now got publicity. ""With the play and the film, we're hoping to show people that whatever obstacles you face, you can achieve the things you strive for. ""On a political level, things are never simplistic. Britain may have been a different place for black people at that time and there was prejudice. ""But at the same time, there were a number of progressive institutions and people who helped the black community and Walter on their way. Cameron hosts talks on football racism . ""Symbolically, Britain has been a multicultural place for a long time. Tull had a black father and a white mother and if you look at the number of mixed-race footballers, he led the way for them."" But what would Tull have made of the recent events in Serbia? And what would he have though of the John Terry racism saga that has proved so divisive for English footall over the last year? ""I think he would have been very sad,"" said Vasili. ""Britain is a different place today than it was when Walter was alive and there have been giant strides. ""He was the only black outfield player in the top division at one time and now that isn't the case. He was a great role model and led the way for those that play today."" Football pioneer: Andrew Watson - the first black international . Tull, who was born in Folkestone, Kent, on April 28, 1888, endured a difficult childhood with illness, death and poverty plaguing the family. The grandson of slaves in Barbados, his father arrived in England in 1876 following abolition some 43 years earlier. Walter's mother, Alice, died when he was just seven before his father passed away two years later. With all six children surviving their parents' death, the demands on their stepmother, Clara, were too much to bear and Tull along with his brother Edward were taken to live in a Methodist orphanage in Bethnal Green, east London. When Edward was adopted two years later by a couple from Glasgow and went on to become the first black dentist in the city, Walter turned to football to help with his solitude. It was here, while training to be a printer, Walter caught the eye with his football skills and soon won a trial with amateur side Clapton F.C. Vitriolic racism . His success, which helped the club win the Amateur Cup, London Senior Cup and London County Amateur Cup in the 1908-1909 season, secured him a dream move to Tottenham Hotspur. The transfer made Walter just the second black professional player in the English top division and the first outfield player. After making his debut at the age of 21, Walter enjoyed success at Tottenham until a vitriolic episode of racism at Bristol City in October 1909. Crime and punishment in sport: Laying down the law? ""The game at Bristol was the first time I came across racism being mentioned in a match report,"" said Vasili. ""In previous reports, writers would use coded language such as 'Tull took unwarranted abuse' but there was no hiding it in this Bristol game."" The Football Star described the Bristol City fans racist chants as ""lower than Billingsgate"", while another newspaper labeled it as ""a cowardly attack"". One reporter vented his fury by writing, ""Let me tell those Bristol hooligans that Tull is so clean in his mind and method as to be a model for all white men who play football."" The episode appeared to embarrass Tottenham, which promptly dropped Tull from the team and sold him to Northampton Town. Under Herbert Chapman, the future manager of Arsenal, Walter enjoyed great success, making 110 appearances and attracting the interest of Scottish giants Glasgow Rangers. The First World War broke out in 1914, with Tull signing up to the 17th Service Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment, which was nicknamed, ""The Diehards"". Cole apologizes for outburst over Terry racism case . He was involved in combat at the end of the Battle of the Somme between October and November 1916, before being sent back to England suffering from trench foot and shell shock. After making a full recovery, Walter was ordered to go up to Scotland to the Officer Training Corps, despite military regulations forbidding those who were not of ""pure European descent"" from becoming officers. Military bravery . In May 1917, he was appointed an officer, despite it being technically illegal. ""I guess he never received the medal because the rules at the time prohibited it,"" added Vasili. ""Perhaps those on the ground didn't realize and some civil servant or bureaucrat must have pointed it out. ""They couldn't have given an award to a black soldier and not a white soldier at the time."" Walter's military success continued as he became the first black officer in the British Army to lead troops into battle. In Italy, he led his men at the Battle of Piave and was commended for his outstanding leadership abilities by his peers. Walter's efforts did not go unnoticed and he was recommended for the Military Cross, but never received it. Chelsea defender Cole charged with misconduct after abusive tweet . After finishing in Italy, Walter was transferred to the Somme Valley in France. It was on March 25, 1918 while trying to escape a German advance at Favreuil, that he was fatally injured by machine gun fire. ""Such was Walter's bond with his men that even with the machine guns firing, his men still tried to recover his body,"" said Vasili. ""They risked their lives to try and bring him back because he was a person who they all looked up to and respected. He was a very humble character, who wanted to be judged by his actions and deeds. ""I think that his Methodist background gave him a code to live by and helped guide him through life.""

"(CNN) -- Burkina Faso's military on Saturday backed one of its officers to lead the country temporarily, seemingly settling what had been two officers' claims to authority after the West African nation's longtime president resigned. The military's leadership will support Lt. Col. Isaac Yacouba Zida as interim President until elections can be held, according to a military statement broadcast by the country's TV stations. That came a day after Zida and the top military official, Gen. Honore Nabere Traore, both claimed that they were in charge following the resignation of President Blaise Compaore, who stepped down Friday amid violent protests demanding an end to his 27-year rule. Saturday's military statement said Traore is among those backing Zida, who most recently was the deputy chief of the presidential guard. Compaore and his family, meanwhile, departed the country and arrived in neighboring Ivory Coast on Saturday, the latter nation's state-run Agence Ivoirienne Presse reported. The resignation . Demonstrators on Thursday stormed Parliament, setting fire to the building. The protests came amid rising discontent about a high cost of living and Compaore's attempts to amend the country's constitution to help him extend his term. Compaore had been in office since he took power after a bloody coup in 1987. Faced with the demonstrations Thursday, Compaore initially dissolved the government and said he would stay in power until elections could be carried out. But he changed his mind, and on Friday announced his resignation. Compaore said he stepped down to preserve peace in Burkina Faso -- a key partner for Western countries in the campaign against Islamist militants. Traore was the first to claim the presidency Friday, appealing for calm and calling for a return to a normal constitutional process. But Zida then took to national television, declaring himself president until political parties could agree on a transitional governing body. ""I assume starting from today the responsibilities of head of this transition and head of state to ensure the continuity of the state,"" he said. Upon his resignation, Compaore appealed via Twitter for ""free elections to be held in Burkina Faso within 90 days at the most."" France, the former colonial ruler of what is today Burkina Faso, welcomed the President's resignation and called for elections to happen quickly. Flights in and out of Ouagadougou, the capital, have been suspended, according to the Burkina Faso Embassy in Washington. Embassy personnel told CNN that it was still issuing visas but that there were no flights at the moment. The country was formerly known as the Republic of Upper Volta when it was established in 1958 as a self-governing colony under France.

"(CNN) -- In this age of austerity, America is run by men with wealth that could have leapt from the pages of ""The Great Gatsby."" The president's worth is estimated at $8.3 million, while Mitt Romney's is placed at a staggering $255 million. Both have tried to make a character issue out of each other's lifestyle -- conservatives complain that President Barack Obama takes too many vacations and White House aides say that Romney is living on ""another planet."" Given his wealth, Romney could probably afford to buy one. He has filed an application to bulldoze his $12 million house in La Jolla, California, and build an even bigger one on top of it. How can either of these men empathize with the financial plight of America's middle class? American democracy is saturated with cash. Last week in Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker spent $30.5 million to beat Tom Barrett, who personally raised just $3.9 million. Adding super PAC spending, the race generated about $63.5 million. Tea party members will say that Democrats have little right to complain about the amount of money spent on a recall election that they triggered. But there's no denying that the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which opened the floodgates for corporate campaign contributions, helped Walker keep his governorship. Forbes estimates that 14 billionaires gave to the Republican incumbent; only one of them lives in Wisconsin. Discussion about the role of money in politics invariably centers on campaign donations. But with such gigantic sums flying around, there has to be a cultural impact, too. Politics has become so saturated with cash that its protagonists have started to feel surreally detached from everyday life. On the Democratic side, there was Anna Wintour's bizarre ad celebrating her wonderful life and inviting Obama supporters to have dinner with her and Sarah Jessica Parker. For the Republicans, you may remember Romney's attempt to make a $10,000 bet with Rick Perry. But the best has to be Rick Santorum's moving claim that he, too, had suffered in the credit crunch because his house fell 25% in value. Before you well up, that's a fall from $2 million to $1.6 million. Everybody suspects that politicians are rolling in money, but a review of the figures might surprise even the most cynical. The average citizens' annual income is $49,445. In 2010, the average net worth of a U.S. senator was $13.2 million, and the average worth of a House member was $5.9 million. The wealth is spread across both parties: In fact, seven out of 10 of the richest senators are Democrats. Romney, Obama: Why they have trouble connecting . One side effect is that Washington has gained impressive financial and cultural clout. In 2011, Washington became the richest city in the United States. Its average income of $84,000 is 60% higher than the national median. There are several reasons for this. Washington is surrounded by rich suburbs; the government actually grew during the recession, and federal employee compensation averages out at $126,000. Most importantly, the city is a magnet for lobbyists. Lobbying and campaign work have become big businesses that offer huge dollar rewards to rival the returns of 1980s junk bonds. Betting on candidates or special interests has become a form of speculation: Land a big client and a lobbyist could cream off a sizable percentage. Then there's the Wall Street money. Since 1998, the financial sector has outspent any other sector in lobbying, to the tune of $4.6 billion. In 2011, it employed more than 1,000 lobbyists and spent more than $82 million. Of course, most members of Congress earned their money the good old-fashioned way (including marrying and inheriting it), and the voter shouldn't necessarily hold their success against them. One politician who stands out for having a comparatively unsettled financial situation is Obama. Yes, his $8.3 million is a lot of money, but he comes from an unusually impoverished background, including a period lived on food stamps. His contemporary wealth is built on a mix of his salary and royalties from his popular books. Still the days of the citizen legislator are long gone. The intensity of luxury and wealth has to affect the ability of lawmakers to empathize with voters on very low salaries or none at all. It's easy to imagine that the debate over health care reform or the Bush tax cuts is affected by the fact that, for many people on the Hill, the former is an academic question and the latter is personally advantageous. This isn't a partisan liberal statement. The median identity of a congressman is a rich, white, middle-aged, male lawyer. There is a deficit of experience of running a business or trying to survive on welfare payments. There is a good case for another round of campaign finance reform, although Citizens United will make any such effort hard to accomplish. But even if individual or corporate contributions were limited, this wouldn't affect a bigger cultural problem in contemporary Washington. Government is increasingly run by people who, financially, have little in common with their constituents. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Tim Stanley: The $30.5 million Scott Walker spent to keep his Wisconsin seat was staggering .
