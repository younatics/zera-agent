Corey McCourt wanted his service dog Mina (pictured) buried in a national cemetery and his mother is now fighting to make it happen . A bomb-sniffing Army dog has been denied burial in a national cemetery, despite having served nine tours of duty in Afghanistan. Mina, a Labrador retriever, was honorably discharged at age 11 with the rank of sergeant and then adopted by his brother in battle, Army Sgt. Corey McCourt. Last week, Mina was euthanized at 13 after suffering a debilitating lung ailment. As McCourt continues his service duties, his mother June Etlinger got the job of finding a proper burial for Mina. McCourt asked that Mina be buried in Great Lakes National Cemetery in Holly, Michigan. But when the White Lake, Michigan military reached out to the national cemetery about burying Mina, she says she was snubbed. 'I don't think he's ever been asked that question before,' Etlinger told Fox 2 News. 'So he was kind of like ""no, we don't do that here.""' According to Etlinger, the cemetery even threw her a little attitude. That, she said, doesn't sit well with her. Mina served three tours of duty alongside McCourt. The two worked as a team, with Mina leading McCourt to bombs so he could disarm them. Dangerous work that Etlinger says makes Mina deserving of a hero's burial. 'They were battle buddies,' Etlinger . said. 'He brought my son home three times and six other people before . him. My feeling is you need to honor him.' Etlinger's . is a thoroughly military family. Her father and grandparents are all . buried at Great Lakes National Cemetery and and she expects . she expects both her service member sons to be buried there one day, . too. Not forgotten: Mina's service won her a sergeant's rank but doesn't earn her a burial in a national cemetery . Her dedication to the cause, then, is understandable. Unfortunately, the animal hospital where Mina's remains currently reside will only keep them there for two weeks. So, . the Michigan mom's one-woman grass roots campaign to get Mina interred . at at the cemetery has also become a race against time. With the clock ticking, Etlinger has . started a Facebook page to spread word of her dilemma and try to move . public support, and the support of Pentagon officials, in her favor. The page quickly gained over 500,000 'likes.' Hero's burial: His Army handler asked that Mina (left) be buried in Great Lakes National Cemetery (right) but the Pentagon says that's just not how they do things . And on Thursday, Etlinger even reached out to U.S. Sen. Carl Levin for help. Meanwhile, a statement from National Cemetery Administration maintains the Michigan cemetery's stance. 'The NCA understands how much service members love and respect their dog comrades,' the statement reads, 'They do honourable work and also serve our country. However, the National Cemetery Administration does not permit animals to be buried in any of our cemeteries.' But Etlinger is undeterred. With a confirmation from the Pentagon that national cemeteries will not bury animals, she is still prepared to take her fight all the way to Washington in spite of the odds. 'Now, they’ve made me mad,' she said. 'I’m not stopping. I’m not one to quit.'","Army mom determined to get Mina a hero's burial .

A father born without functioning hands is suing Six Flags theme park after he was stopped from riding the Aquaman Splashdown. Clint Bench, who does not have fully formed hands, says he was 'embarrassed' after being told to get off the ride by staff at the Six Flags Over Texas in front of his children. In the suit, filed in Dallas federal court, Mr Dench says the amusement park violated the Americans With Disabilities Act. Clint Bench had bought three season tickets to Six Flags Over Texas amusement park in Arlington but was told he could not ride the Aquaman Splashdown because he has no hands . The father-of-two, from Weatherford, Texas, said when he tried to board the ride last May he was told by an employee to leave 'because he does not have hands', according to Dallas News. In the suit, Mr Bench said it caused him 'considerable embarrassment' as his children had never seen him discriminated before. Aquaman riders sit in a boat that travels down into water, causing a large wave to soak them. The papers filed on Tuesday say: 'Mr Bench is a physically fit, healthy adult with great . upper body strength. He can perform all manners of activities, including . activities that one would normally assume would require the use of . hands.' He can write, type, tie his shoes, fire a gun and enjoys water skiing and mountain biking and has never considered using prosthetics, it said. Mr Dench said he was 'embarrassed' and he said his children had never seen him being discriminated against . Mr Bench is suing for an undisclosed amount for 'mental anguish' as well as a refund for the three Six Flags season tickets he had bought and his attorney's fees. Lawyers for Mr Bench claim the amusement park altered its restriction rules after he made a complaint. A guide, they claim was written in September, now states that Aquaman riders 'must have one full arm and one full leg.' Dallas News quoted the papers as saying: 'Mr Bench - who is capable of riding every ride at Six Flags Over Texas, and who has done so many times without injury to himself of others - is now unable to enjoy the rides with his family.;' It added that people who choose to raise their hands in the air 'in a silly display of bravado' are not prevented from going on further rides. Sharon Parker, the spokesperson for Six Flags, told Dallas News that she had not seen the suit 'but generally we don’t comment on pending litigation.'","Clint Bench told he could not ride 'because he does not have hands'

A Catholic deacon has been jailed after cheating an elderly dementia sufferer out of his life savings and spending the money on gambling and his daughter's wedding. Peter Hesketh persuaded widower Peter Court to sign over power of attorney to him and claimed to be investing in lucrative business deals. But instead he took more than £60,000 from the vulnerable pensioner to pay for his own mortgage - later telling police that the money had been given to him in return for managing Mr Court's finances. Hesketh, 65, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison after being found guilty of theft at Worcester Crown Court. The deacon from Our Lady & St Pius X Roman Catholic church in Kidderminster met Mr Court while visiting the pub where he was a landlord before falling ill. The pensioner granted the priest power of attorney over his finances after Hesketh promised he would put it into risk-free business ventures. Instead, he took £61,429 and used it to bet on horse racing and pay off the mortgage on his £255,000 house in Kidderminster. He even spent £20,000 of Mr Court's life savings to pay for a venue for his daughter's wedding. Trust: Father of five Hesketh, 60, was a deacon in the Roman Catholic Church . Andrea Hesketh and her new husband Carl Berisford-Murray invited more than 100 guests to a lavish reception at a Kidderminster hotel. After the victim died in 2007 aged 75, his family discovered that thousands of pounds were missing from his account. Hesketh - who was so trusted by Mr Court that he even officiated at his funeral - was arrested the next year. He claimed that the pensioner had paid him £20,000 a year to manage his finances, which were 'a pig's bloody breakfast'. But judge Toby Hooper dismissed Hesketh's version of events as 'preposterous', telling the defendant he had carried out a 'planned and careful series of many thefts' from a man who held him in 'high regard'. He added: 'It is tragic to note you evidently held your victim in contempt, as is evidenced by your claim that you were ministering to him in religion during the offending and by derogatory remarks that you made about him. 'But for your victim's untimely death, your offending would have continued indefinitely, or at least until you had stolen all that his accounts contained.' Prosecutor Paul Mytton told the court that the father of five, who was ordained a deacon in 1992, had been 'in control of the purse strings' and thought no one would notice the swindle. Peter Arnold, defending, said Hesketh would find jail difficult because of health problems which included epilepsy and gout. Church: Hesketh worked at Our Lady and St Pius X church in Kidderminster . After the case, Phillipa . Charlesworth, of West Mercia Police, said: 'Hesketh was evasive and . inconsistent during our dealings with him and it was clear he was not . telling the truth. 'As power of attorney he should have been acting in Peter Court's best interests - instead he acted in his own. 'He has now paid a high price for that betrayal of trust by losing his liberty.' Monsignor Timothy Menezes, Vicar . General of the Archdiocese of Birmingham, said: 'I am saddened to learn . that the Reverend Mr Peter Hesketh, a married deacon of our Diocese, has . been found guilty of theft and a breach of the trust that was placed in . him.'

Indeed, in 1880 many wild birds were granted the protection of the law. So when Queen Victoria’s eldest son Edward was accused of blasting an owl out of the sky it is perhaps not surprising that he took umbrage. In fact, he did his very best to hush the matter up, sending an imperious rebuke to the well-meaning individual who had dared to suggest he had shot the protected bird of prey. The apparent cover-up has only just become known after the letters came up for auction, more than 100 years after they were written. After King Edward VII is said to have shot a protected owl, well-meaning society snapper John Phillips sent this photograph of the stuffed bird to the Prince of Wales, which includes the inscription: 'Shot by HRH Prince of Wales on the 23rd Sept 1896 at Wynyard Park' Queen Victoria's son, Edward (far right), later King Edward VII, out on a shoot . The prince, who was later to become King Edward VII, is said to have killed the owl at a royal shoot in 1896 in County Durham. Society photographer John Phillips took . the bird away, stuffed it and sent him a picture of it. Beneath the bird . was a plaque which read: ‘Shot by HRH Prince of Wales on the 23rd Sept . 1896 at Wynyard Park.’ Royal shoot: A photo Mr Phillips took of the hunting party which the Prince of Wales (far left, middle row) was part of when he shot the owl, in Wynyard Park, County Durham . Revealed: The previously unseen letters have now emerged for the first time after being made available for sale at auction .

Back came a stinging letter from Edward’s private . secretary on Sandringham note paper. Sent to the estate manager at Wynyard, it read: ‘The Prince… is rather . annoyed at Mr Phillips. HRH desires me to point out that he was not at . Wynyard and also to say that he has not shot an owl for the last 25 . years. ‘Would you mind very kindly asking Mr Phillips what he means by inventing such a story?’ A mortified Mr Phillips, from Belfast, replied: ‘I am extremely sorry to . have caused any dissatisfaction or annoyance to HR Highness. Indeed I . sent the photo thinking it would be a pleasant surprise and that it . would meet with HR Highness’s approval.’ Edward’s response was unforgiving: ‘HRH does not quite understand how he . [Mr Phillips] shows his loyalty by inventing something about him.’ At the time, the persecution  of wild birds was also becoming . increasingly unpopular with the public and was one of the reasons why the RSPB was founded five years later. The Wild Bird Protection Act was . passed in 1880. This might be why Edward denied the claim. The photos and letters, valued at around £600, go on sale on February 26 with Sworders auctioneers of Essex.

Serious: Attorney General Dominic Grieve told the Court of Appeals that the initial sentences handed to the four men 'did not reflect the seriousness of the offences' Four members of a traveller family who kept vulnerable drug addicts and alcoholics and forced them to work should be given longer sentences, the Attorney General said today. Dominic Grieve urged appeal judges to impose harsher sentences on the group who were found guilty after treating the men like slaves, subjecting them to beatings and leaving them to scavenge food from dustbins. Mr Grieve, who is the Government's principal legal adviser, told the Court of Appeal in London that judges should increase the jail terms given to William Connors, 52, his sons John Connors, 29, and James Connors, 20, and son-in-law Miles Connors, 24. The four men were jailed after being convicted of conspiracy to compel people to carry out forced labour by a jury at Bristol Crown Court in December, having pleaded not guilty. He told the court that the sentences 'did not reflect the seriousness of the offences'. Mr Grieve also said that tougher sentences would serve as a deterrent. William Connors, known as 'Big Boss' was handed a six-and-a-half year jail term by judge Michael Longman. John Connors was given a four-year term, James Connors a three-year term in a young offenders' institution and Miles Connors a three-year term. Mr Grieve, who is a senior barrister and the Conservative MP for Beaconsfield, said: 'At the end of the day the sentences imposed appear to use to have been too light.' Jailed: John Connors (left) was sentenced to a six-and-a-half year sentence, while his son-in-law Miles Connors (right) was handed a three-year term . Sentences: Brothers John (left) and James (right), sons of John Connors, were given a four-year term and a three-year term in a young offenders' institute respectively . Lawyers representing the men disagreed and told judges that the sentences imposed were not 'unduly lenient'. The three judges - Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, Mr Justice Simon and Mr Justice Irwin - will announce their decision at a later date. Trial jurors had been told how the Connors family had a private workforce made up of men who were were homeless drifters or addicts. Prosecutors said workers forced to work for as little as £5 a day and were given alcohol and cannabis. Cruelty: Wealthy traveller William Connors, 51, berates one of his labourers at a caravan park . Sick: Connors is caught on CCTV apparently assaulting one of the slaves he was said to pay less than £5 a day . The Victims lived in squalid caravans on traveller sites as they moved around the country working on the Connors' paving and patio businesses, the trial heard. One worker had a hosepipe shoved down his throat and the men were often made to strip for a 'hosing down' with freezing water. The Connors family owned homes with hot tubs; a fleet of cars including a Rolls-Royce and a Mercedes saloon; enjoyed Caribbean cruises and holidays in Mexico and Dubai; and had £500,000 in the bank. Cramped: Workers were made to live in caravans owned the Connors family, who had purchased several sites . Shocking: The Connors reportedly supplied workers, pictured, with cannabis while depriving them of enough food to keep them subservient . The Connors had also built up a property portfolio potentially worth millions of pounds. During the trial, the family maintained that the men were 'free agents', with William and Mary claiming they were 'good Samaritans' providing the homeless with food, work and shelter.

A college professor who plotted to blow up the Polish parliament may have murdered his mother when she found out about his plans, police believe. Polish police announced yesterday that the body of a woman found in a shallow grave in national park woodland is that of Brunon Kwiecien's mother Julita Kotas. Detectives are now investigating whether Kwiecien killed her when she discovered he was plotting to detonate a four tonne bomb outside parliament and kill both the country's president and prime minister. Police are investigating whether Brunon Kwiecien killed his mother Julita Kotas when she discovered his plot to blow up parliament with a four tonne bomb . Kwiecien, who worshipped Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik, was arrested in Krakow in November where he was found with four tonnes of explosives, detonators and a handgun. He planned to rig a truck as a giant bomb and then ram through security fences around the Polish parliament. The right-wing chemist also had Hexogen T$, the highest grade of military plastic explosive. Other items included detonators, mobile phone bomb triggers, firearms and live ammunition, said prosecutor Mariusz Krason. He was put under surveillance by Poland's secret service and then arrested after his biologist wife alerted police. She had become concerned when he starting quizzing her about which diseases and pathogens would be the most lethal. Kwiecien worshipped mass murderer Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway in bomb and gun attacks . Reports also suggested his students at . Krakow's Agricultural University raised concerns after he ranted about . the amount of control the state has over ordinary life and about the 'need to . replace state authorities and take action.' The . body of his mother was discovered in April in Ojcow but it was not . until yesterday that officials announced it was Kwiecien's mother. Investigators had been told she moved to Britain but tests have confirmed it to be his mother. The confirmation follows media reports . last week that blood had been found in the woman's house in the village . of Lednica Gorna south of Krakow. The professor - facing bomb-making and terrorism charges - is now also being quizzed over his mother's death. 'We don't know the motive at the moment. Maybe she found out what he was planning, or maybe he thought that as he . planned to die anyway, one more killing wouldn't matter,' said one . police source. Kwiecien had a terrifying arsenal of bombs including explosives and a gun . when he was arrested . The haul included Hexogen T$, the highest grade of military plastic explosive, as well as detonators, mobile phone bomb triggers, firearms and live ammunition . Kwiecien was a fan of Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik and told undercover police investigating him he would not have made the sane 'mistakes' as his hero. After his arrest prosecutors said Kwiecien was a nationalist and an anti-Semite and he believed the country was going in the wrong direction because of the 'foreigners' in government departments. Last week Kwiecien made a statement through his lawyers confirming that he had planned to blow up parliament because of his hatred of politicians in general. Mr Krason said after the arrest: 'Simply put he believed society and the economic situation were moving in the wrong direction due to all government posts and positions of power being held by what he described as ""foreigners""—not true Poles. 'He said he belonged to a nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-Semitic movement.' He had previously boasted of plans to use deadly germ warfare sprays to kill hundreds of people and said he wanted to be 'bigger than Breivik', according to Polish reports. Breivik murdered 77 people in 2011 when . he bombed government buildings in Oslo before carrying out a mass . shooting at camp of the Workers' Youth League. Investigators say Kwiecien made reconnaissance trips to Parlament Sejm in Poland and studied the route for President Bronislaw Komorowski's Independence Day march earlier this month . A Polish television investigation into the plot was told by a source: 'He said that Breivik made mistakes, which he would not repeat, because he would be better.' Officials say he had made reconnaissance visits to government buildings in Warsaw. He is also understood to have studied the area around Poland's parliament, as well as the route marked out for President Bronislaw Komorowski's Independence Day march earlier this month. Stunned staff at the university where he worked said they were shocked when the plot emerged. College rector Professor Włodzimierz Sady said: 'He was an average worker, not outstanding. We are all very shocked.' One childhood neighbour told local media that the professor had always been obsessed with explosives and had lost several fingers in an accidental blast. 'He was always playing with homemade bombs and lost a few fingers,' he said .","Brunon Kwiecien amassed tonnes of explosives before plot was uncovered .

High property prices are deterring many couples from marriage, a leading judge has warned. Family law High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge cited a survey that shows one in six couples do not plan to marry because they cannot afford to buy a home. It also found that cohabiting couples were put off marriage by the cost of the wedding itself. Instead they settle for other arrangements such as living together and are more prone to break-ups. He said: ‘A new national survey shows three quarters of 18 to 24-year-olds, and two thirds of people cohabiting, want to get married at some point. It is clear marriage remains a popular and cherished institution. ‘But when we ask people why they have not married they come up with a range of answers: the cost of weddings, waiting to be asked, not getting round to it, not thinking it’s necessary, or the cost of housing.’ Sir Paul is the founder of the Marriage Foundation think-tank, which commissioned the research by law firm Seddons. The study of 450 people living with partners found 16 per cent do not marry because they cannot afford a house.

Foundation will discuss a new survey which found that although most . people want to get married, nearly one in five London couples say they . have yet to do so because they cannot afford to buy a home. Sir Paul added: ‘There is a real danger here. People can slide into ever greater commitments without ever making a decision to be a couple. ‘Moving in together is, according to our findings, the key transition from being seen as boyfriend and girlfriend to being seen as a couple. ‘But living together was not rated highly as a way of showing commitment. ‘Without such commitment, the build-up of constraints can lead to the breakdown of the relationship.’ Danger: Most people want to get married, but 40 per cent of couples in London are delaying because of the cost . The findings add to evidence that high property prices have a dramatic effect on family life. The . average age of a new mother is now almost 30, with the cost of housing . and mortgage debt thought to be key reasons why women are having . children later. But he . added: 'Too many people are forced to delay marriage while entering into . significant financial commitments and starting families and are . ill-equipped to manage the risks this entails. The survey commissioned by Seddons in collaboration with The Marriage Foundation found that 40 per cent of couples in the capital said they were delaying marriage because it is too expensive to proceed. Sixteen per cent said they have yet to marry because they cannot afford to buy a home together. Nearly six out of ten Londoners said they wanted to get married.","Sir Paul Coleridge said cost of housing is 'real danger' to marriage .

Tragic: Amelia Saunders, 4, attended her last day at school before an inoperable brain tumour takes her life . For most school children, the end of the Christmas term is a happy occasion with the promise of gifts and festivities to come. But for one four-year-old, it proved decidedly more poignant. Amelia Saunders went into school today for the final time before an inoperable brain tumour takes her life. Her father, Richard Saunders, said: 'I can't really . describe how we feel right now. Scared, perhaps. We have to say goodbye . soon to our baby, our angel. She is as much a part of us as we are of . her. When she is gone, a huge part of us will go with her. ‘There are so many things in our lives ahead where that hole will show.’ Amelia has already defied the odds that were stacked against her by surviving longer than the few weeks doctors gave her at the start of 2012 when they discovered the advanced tumour on her brain stem. Her parents, Mr Saunders and wife Chantal, from near Reading in Berkshire, refused to accept the devastating news at first and looked to America for clinical trials. Amelia's plight was taken up by . hundreds of fundraisers who raised £200,000 in just 12 weeks to send her . to Houston for experimental treatment. As . part of the fundraising campaign Amelia opened shops, firefighters . cycled around the country and stalls were set up all to raise money. Her condition improved so much she . started the foundation stage at independent Crosfields School in Reading . and began writing her name. She . is also the current holder of Pride of Reading Child of Courage 2012 . award and attended the ceremony to collect it in person at the end of . November. Poignant: Amelia's father, Richard Saunders wrote on his blog that he hoped his daughter would be able to 'say goodbye to her school friends and give them that smile we all know.' Never give up: Amelia's parents (father pictured) sent their daughter to Houston for experimental treatment this year after doctors discovered the inoperable tumour on her brain stem . However, her father Mr Saunders said he only had a short time left with their daughter. In his regular blog on the Amelia's Miracle Facebook page where he keeps supporters updated with their lives, he said: ‘Amelia managed to go to school for a few hours this morning (Wed) but Friday will be her last day. Hope: Amelia's condition improved and she won the Pride of Reading Child of Courage 2012 award (pictured) ‘It will be another school day like all the rest - but one where the teachers will know she will not be back again. Chantal and I know this isn't going to be easy. 'Amelia will not know, but there will be an empty chair at her table next term. ‘Hoping tomorrow (Fri) Amelia can say goodbye to her school friends and give them that smile we all know. No tears, just smiles.’ He said they noticed Amelia deteriorating at the end of August and she has visited Great Ormond Street Hospital. However they fear the tumour is growing and is affecting Amelia's spine and therefore control of her lower body. She is set to spend some days in a hospice next week. He paid tribute to his daughter's courage: ‘Amelia became a star. She always was a star to us, but she became known to everyone who saw her, and loved by all. 'She touched the hearts of so many thousands of people, from all over the world, and the love poured in, in return. ‘In turn, Chantal and my hearts were lifted by this and we felt so driven to fight our way through this. ‘I know she will always be there, alongside us. I know I want to go with her but can't, because I have to be strong for Chan and Charlotte. ‘But this does not make the pain go away. All of you who have shared our journey will feel a little of this right now. 'A star': Amelia's father spoke of his daughter's courage and said he does not have long left with his daughter . A story that we all wanted a happy ending to. One we could all have our say in, make a difference, and inspire others with. ‘A story of hope and of a little girl who showed us all what fighting spirit means.

David Cameron will address an audience of 2,200 at the party conference today, but he has spent the week building a much bigger crowd online. The Prime Minister ignored his own advice about the perils of Twitter and signed up to the micro-blogging site on Saturday night, promising more 'edgy' political output. Four days later @David_Cameron has attracted more than 100,000 followers, been bombarded with abuse and posted the obligatory photo of food. 'Thanks to my team for squeezing in a quick birthday celebration on this v hectic day.' The PM was presented with a caterpillar birthday cake by Foreign Secretary William Hague (centre) and Chief of Staff Ed Llewellyn (right) Today he tweeted before his keynote speech, telling his followers: 'I’m levelling with the British people in my speech at 11.30. It's sink or swim, do or decline. How we'll ensure Britain wins the Global Race.' And as he left the conference venue in Bimrngham he added: 'Just leaving what has been a great #cpc12. A big thank you to all involved, we really showed that 'Britain can deliver.' In 2009  the Tory leader told Christian O’Connell’s Absolute Radio breakfast show: ‘The trouble with Twitter, the instantness of it – too many twits might make a t***.’ But with millions of people – and potential voters – on the site, the lure of Twitter became too strong to resist. On Saturday night Mr Cameron announced his arrival on the site with a reference to his 2009 warning: ‘I'm starting Conference with this new Twitter feed about my role as Conservative Leader. I promise there won't be ""too many tweets...’ On Monday Mr Cameron used the @David_Cameron account to reveal he had packed some boxes for the #supportoursoldiers campaign . Here is a selection of some of the comments which @David_Cameron is being bombarded with: . ‏@Gaslef mornin dave, what atrocities are you planning to inflict on the working classes today then? #toriesruiningthenation . @JamesCridland today you say that Britain has no future unless difficult decisions are taken. I don't think you understand concept of time. ‏@JaneR1969: How are you getting away with killing off so many sick and disabled you turd? When are you going to be up in court for it? @Codeine74 Hello Dave, this is your daily reminder that thousands of Britain's most vulnerable people are suffering more thanks to you. @thisisamy_ I am seriously angry by @David_Cameron 's comments. Stop LYING & pretending you're helping the poor & vulnerable. You do not care one bit. @Chad_C_Mulligan Yawn. Another super-shiny PR opportunity. Why aren't your sleeves rolled up, Dave? ‏@hoolscon spare us the mush about your family Dave, your a rich boy who inherited his wealth so don't try make out your one of us plebs . ‏@Bethemediauk I thought you said you wouldn't tweet much. That's 7 now. 7 too many. Before the account was set up aides . promised it would be an ‘edgy’ and ‘more political’ outlet for the Prime . Minister to target voters. The . official Downing Street accounts is covered by Civil Service rules on . impartiality and cannot be used for party political purposes. To date it has been rather more sedate, consisting of posts praising speeches by colleagues, alerting people to imminent TV appearances and photos of charity work. The response has been rather more boisterous than the PM’s own tweets, with users posting a stream of abuse often aimed at Mr Cameron’s wealth. Mr Cameron defended his decision to join the site this week. He told Sky News: 'In this modern world you have got to use every means to try and communicate your message and explain to people why you are doing it. 'You've got to get with the programme, I suppose.' Before the account was set up, sources close to the PM said they wanted to use it as political tool to reach voters directly. 'He wants something that’s able to be more political,’ said a party source. ‘Especially when it comes down to the local, European and general elections he needs something where he can connect more directly with the voters as leader of the Conservative party.’ Mr Cameron was the 370th MP to start an account. So far Mr Cameron has not interacted with any voters, or even the 34 Tory MPs and peers he is following. Within . 12 hours the account had 75,000 followers but bookmakers Ladbrokes were . offering odds of 25/1 that he would reach 100,000 before the Tory . conference in Birmingham closed today. On Sunday David Cameron tweeted: 'About to appear on @MarrShow: I'll be explaining how we're on the side of people who want to get on in life.' The first photo the PM posted: 'Today I met the nursing team at the John Radcliffe Hospital, and announced £140m to help their work across the country' He passed that landmark early on . Tuesday, later posting: I'm told some bookmakers are regretting laying . odds against this account passing 100,000 followers during conference.’ Ladbrokes are now offering odds of 1/2 that he will reach a million followers by the end of the year.But punters can get 20/1 that the account will be closed before 2013. With just a few hours to go until the close of the party conference, the bookies are offering odds of 4/1 that Mr Cameron will unfollow Boris Johnson's account before the party leaves Bimringham. Aides say the next target is to overtake Ed Miliband’s account, which has 166,000 followers. But the Labour leader's use of the . site has not been without controversy, famously paying tribute to . Blockbusters host Bob Holness with the hashtag #Blackbusters.

Daniel Bagshaw collapsed of a timebomb heart condition, and died yards from the finishing line of the Hong Kong triathlon . An super-fit lawyer who died yards from the finishing line of the Hong Kong triathlon, is believed to have suffered with a timebomb heart condition. Daniel Bagshaw may have suffered an arrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat - like Bolton Wanderers’ footballer Fabrice Muamba, an inquest heard. His mother was diagnosed with the genetic condition Long QT Syndrome, just weeks before he died. But Mr Bagshaw, 27, and his two brothers hadn’t yet been tested. Mother Shelagh said: 'I wish I had found out that little bit earlier and that we had realised how urgent it was. 'There wasn’t enough time between me being diagnosed and anyone else getting tested. 'If it could stop any family going through what we are going through it would be worth it. The first thing I said when I was diagnosed was ‘what about my three sons? Is it likely to affect them?’ Mr Bagshaw, a lawyer from Accrington, Lancashire, died on the final stretch of the International Triathlon Union Asian Cup in Lantau, Hong Kong, on October 14 - just five days after his 27th birthday. He had previously completed a number of triathlons, marathons, half marathons, an amateur section of the Tour de France and had climbed Mount Everest. 'I was still waiting for appointment to see a consultant for more detail about the condition,” said Shelagh. 'Before Daniel’s death, there didn’t seem to be much of a rush. I had had the condition all my life without realising. 'It’s vital my two sons get tested, for them and their families. I would hate anything to happen to them now. 'We have been told that the tests could take another six months to complete. It’s like looking like a needle in a haystack for a genetic fault.' Coroner Michael Singleton, at Blackburn Coroner’s Court on Thursday, said his post mortem examination suggested he had suffered from an arrhythmia - the condition suffered by Bolton footballer Fabrice Muamba whose heart stopped for over an hour while on the pitch. Mrs Bagshaw, of Riverlea Gardens, Clitheroe, Lancashire, was diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome in August 2012 - a condition which makes the heart beat irregularly. Write caption here .

'If it could stop any family going through what we are going through it would be worth it. 'Even if thousands are tested on just one person is diagnosed, it would be worth it.

Mr Bagshaw, a lawyer from Accrington, Lancashire, died on the final stretch of the International Triathlon Union Asian Cup in Lantau, Hong Kong, at Disneyland . Coroner Michael Singleton said a post mortem examination was carried out in Hong Kong, which proved inconclusive and Mr Bagshaw’s death was possibly caused by an arrhythmia - an abnormal heart beat and put his death down to sudden adult death. He said: 'He could possibly have had Long QT Syndrome, which his mother was diagnosed with in August. 'It’s not uncommon. It seems to affect those that are exceptionally fit, like Fabrice Muamba.' Mr Bagshaw had previously completed a number of triathlons, marathons, half marathons, an amateur section of the Tour de France and had climbed Mount Everest. Father Peter Bagshaw said: 'If you had a blue print for a kid, he ticked all the boxes. 'He trained every day, he ate properly and he was super fit. 'We are devastated. It’s such a waste. We feel like we have been robbed.' Mrs Bagshaw said she found out she had the condition by chance when she got a chest infection. 'I went to the doctors who did an ECG.

A High Court judge yesterday blamed ‘modular’ exams brought in by Labour for a fiasco over GCSE grades. Lord Justice Elias made his comments as he rejected a bid by school leaders, teaching unions and councils to have thousands of English results regraded. They had argued it was ‘illegitimate grade manipulation’ and ‘a statistical fix’ by the AQA and Edexcel exam boards as they had pushed up grade boundaries. After the GSCE grading fiasco: Education secretary Michael Gove is currently overhauling the structural reforms that Labour made to GCSEs in 2009 - changes that were judged today as being inherently unfair . But, while he agreed that some students had been treated unfairly, the judge said the fault lay with the qualification. The case centered on an estimated . 10,000 pupils who sat the exams last June but missed out on a C, the . minimum  normally needed to go into further education. The alliance wanted their results to be regraded in line with those from January 2012, when the boundaries were lower. Labour brought in bite-sized GCSE units in 2009 which could be taken repeatedly. But in 2010 Education Secretary . Michael Gove announced they would go. After yesterday’s judgement, he . demanded that Labour apologise to pupils. Lord Justice Elias said: ‘I am satisfied that it was indeed the structure of the qualification itself which is the source of such unfairness as has been demonstrated in this case.’ GCSE changes under Labour: A Department for Education spokesman said the dispute over 2012 results showed the GCSE system has been in need of fundamental reform since 2009 . Following the judgment, Education Secretary Michael Gove demanded that Labour politicians apologised to pupils, parents and teachers for the fiasco. Mr Gove - who announced the removal of modules from GCSEs in the 2010 Schools White Paper - said: ‘Today’s judgement made it clear that the modular structure created the problem with GCSEs. ‘We took action to clear up the mess caused by Labour.’ The judges were told at a hearing in December that an estimated 10,000 pupils who sat English exams last June missed out on a C grade - the minimum grade normally needed to go into further education. The group of school leaders, teachers and pupils said that the exam boards were to blame because they pushed up the grade boundaries - effectively ‘moving the goalposts’ for pupils. It said this amounted to ‘illegitimate grade manipulation’ and ‘a statistical fix’ involving exams regulator Ofqual. Clive Sheldon QC, appearing for the alliance, claimed students had been unjustifiably ‘clobbered’ to meet the Ofqual requirement of no apparent grade inflation. But in the conclusion to his judgment, Lord Justice Elias, sitting with Mrs Justice Sharp at London’s High Court, said: ‘The problem lies with the modular nature of the examination, coupled with the fact that grade boundaries were assessed and made public at each stage of the process. Michael Gove said that he was cleaning up Labour's mess after they broke up GCSE into 'bitesize' modules that could be retaken repeatedly as part of his wider education reforms . ‘Mr Sheldon was highly critical of this structure. He rightly points out that a high number of experts had predicted precisely the kind of difficulties which have, in fact, arisen.’ He added: ‘I am satisfied that it was indeed the structure of the qualification itself which is the source of such unfairness as has been demonstrated in this case, and not any unlawful action by either Ofqual or the AOs (exam boards).’ He dismissed the alliance’s application for a judicial review, but said the issue had caused an outcry and was a ‘matter of widespread and genuine concern properly brought to court’. Lawyers for the alliance had argued for the June exams to be regraded in line with those taken in January when the boundaries were lower. But Edexcel and AQA said they had behaved properly and Ofqual argued it had acted in a ‘clear, principled and transparent way’. The Association of School and College Leaders yesterday described the ruling as ‘very disappointing’ but said the judge had recognised that pupils had been treated ‘unfairly’. A spokesman for the AQA exam board said the ruling ‘confirmed that we set the right grade boundaries for GCSE English last summer’. He added: ‘In the judges’ view, the main reason schools did not get the results they expected was the modular structure of the qualification.’ A Department for Education spokesman said the dispute showed the GCSE system has been in need of fundamental reform. Balls up: Ed Balls, left, was education secretary when Labour changed the GCSE structure in 2009. The present Conservative education secretary Michael Gove, right, has insisted Balls apologise for the 'unfair' reforms . He said: ‘We are now making further reforms to GCSEs, including overhauling league tables so they are fair to schools and pupils, and still give parents and the public the information they need. ‘The judgement demonstrates that overall Ofqual got it right last year.’ The government in Wales has already intervened to re-grade some GCSE English results. In a report last November, Ofqual concluded that January’s GCSE English assessments, which accounted for about 10 per cent of entries, had been ‘graded generously’. However, the June boundaries had been properly set and candidates’ work had been accurately graded.","A bid to have thousands of GCSE grades remarked has been turned down .

Veronica Ojeda, right, pictured with Diego Maradona at a tennis match, gave birth to a baby boy named after his famous father on Wednesday. They split when she was four months pregnant . It is not known when he will travel to Argentina to see his new son. News of the birth was confirmed by Maradona's doctor Alfredo Cahe. He said: 'He's called Diego Fernando, he was born on February 13 at 11.57pm and he weighs 7lbs. 'Both mother and baby are doing well.' Maradona split from girlfriend of eight years Ojeda, 33, when she was four and a half months pregnant.

Former University of Montana Grizzlies quarterback Jordan Johnson 'changed into a totally different person' before he allegedly raped a 21-year-old student in her bedroom, the woman has testified. Taking the stand yesterday, the third day of Johnson's trial, the alleged victim described how she at first enjoyed kissing the 20-year-old when she invited him over to watch a video on February 4, 2012, but repeatedly told him 'no' when he tried to take it further. 'He didn't say anything. He just changed – just changed into a totally different person,' she told jurors. Johnson then ordered her to turn onto her front, threatening: 'Turn over or I'll make you.' When the student refused, he flipped her over and raped her, she said. On trial: Former University of Montana Grizzlies quarterback Jordan Johnson, pictured in court this week, 'changed into a totally different person' his alleged victim claims . 'It hurt so bad, it hurt so bad,' the alleged victim said, breaking down in tears. In response to questions from both the prosecution and defense, the young woman, who hasn't been named, explained how the pair lay on her bed, kissed and even took each others tops off as her roommate played video games in the living room. But she told the seven-woman, five-man jury that she was very clear when she wanted things to stop. 'I gave him very clear instructions. I told him, ""No, not tonight."" I resisted with my arms, resisted with my knees ... I told him no,' she said. The woman told prosecutors that she had never been as afraid in her life as she was during the incident. Courtroom: The alleged victim testified in the court, pictured, on Wednesday . Changed: The woman told jurors Johnson, pictured, told her to turn over before raping her . She said she was in utter shock after the alleged rape took place, which is why she didn't call out to her roommate for help and drove Johnson home afterwards. 'You could have screamed for help,' Assistant Attorney General Joel Thompson said, according to Missoulian.com. 'Could have,' she agreed. 'You didn't,' he said. 'I didn't. There's no real explanation other than I was terrified and in shock. You know how when you have those dreams and you want to scream so bad, but you can't? It was like that.' Towards the end of Wednesday's . testimony, which was attended by Grizzlies football coach Mick Delaney . and former athletic director Jim O'Day, the woman accused Johnson of . having committed similar attacks against other women in the past. Johnson claims the sex was consensual. The trial in Missoula, which began on Monday, has divided the local community where passions about Grizzly football run high. Aggressive: The alleged victim of former University of Montana quarterback Jordan Johnson claims he 'changed' and forced her to have sex with him when she invited him to hers to watch a movie . Prosecutor Adam Duerk said during . opening statements on Monday: 'He changed. His demeanor changed. He . became very aggressive and in her words ""it got very scary really . fast.""' However, Johnson's defense attorney Kirsten Pabst said the alleged victim 'participated' in the sex. She told jurors: 'She participated. She continued. But the fact that he didn't give her a relationship . doesn't mean what happened that night was a crime.' Johnson was dressed in a white shirt as he listened to the statements. The student was the first witness called by the prosecution. Duerk asked her: 'Did you in any way plan to have sex with him.' She replied: 'No'. When asked what her expectations were that night, the woman is heard to reply in a video broadcast by ABC News: 'I just wanted to get to know him. I didn't really hang out with him since a year prior. 'Just kind of get to know him again and see how school is going.' Consensual: Jordan Johnson, center, pictured in a NCAA match against Cal Poly, says the sex was consensual . The case has played out against a backdrop of NCAA and federal investigation of the school athletic department and the manner in which . rape allegations are reported on campus, investigated by police, and . prosecuted by the Missoula County Attorney's Office. District Judge Karen Townsend . initially called 400 potential jurors for the high-profile case, such . was the difficulty in finding neutral jurors. An . affidavit supporting the rape charge said Johnson and the alleged . victim had known each other since 2010 and decided to watch a movie at . her house. The woman told investigators Johnson held her down and forced her to have sex with him in her room despite her protests. Court . records show the woman texted her roommate: 'Omg... I think I might . have just gotten raped... he kept pushing and pushing and I said no but . he wouldn't listen... I just wanna cry... Omg what do I do!' Johnson says the woman flirted with him the day before and consented to the sex the following night. Grizzlies: The Grizzlies football team, pictured, has been successful on the field. But this rape case has been played out against a backdrop of investigations of the school athletic department . Johnson was briefly suspended from the football team then reinstated when a civil no-contact order replaced the restraining order. Three . days after coach Robin Pflugrad welcomed Johnson back, Engstrom . announced he was not renewing the contracts of the coach and athletic . director Jim O'Day. Both were immediately relieved of their duties, without an explanation from Engstrom. The move came after a season when Montana advanced to the Football Championship Subdivision semifinal game. In December 2011, UM President Royce Engstrom ordered an outside investigation after . two students reported being drugged and raped. Former . Supreme Court Justice Diane Barz later said her investigation found . nine alleged rapes or sexual assaults involving students had occurred . between September 2010 and December 2011, including at least two that . hadn't been reported. One led to former Montana football player Beau Donaldson pleading guilty to rape and being sentenced to 10 years in prison. Investigation: The University of Montana President, Royce Engstrom, ordered an outside investigation after two students reported being drugged and raped in December 2011 . Engstrom . said in January the investigation 'indicated an association with . patterns of behavior from a small number of student-athletes.' 'We will not tolerate the tarnishing of the proud tradition of Grizzly athletics,' he said at the time. Barz . suggested training faculty and staff on how to handle and report sexual . assault allegations and rewriting student and student-athlete conduct . codes. Just weeks later, the university came . under more criticism after the dean of students notified a Saudi . national about sexual assault and rape allegations made against him. The student fled the country before the alleged victims could file a police report. The . Grizzlies have advanced to the national title game seven times since . 1995, winning twice. The team's success came even as players and former . players were arrested for drunken driving, assault and other charges. Last . April, the federal Department of Education announced it was . investigating a complaint alleging the university discriminated against . female students, faculty and staff by failing to address a sexually . hostile environmental caused by its failure to appropriately respond to . reports of sexual assault. Soon . after, the U.S. Justice Department announced its investigation into the . handling of rape investigations and prosecutions, and the school . announced in May the NCAA had been investigating its athletic programs . for undisclosed reasons.

Souleiman claimed he had no knowledge of the scam which involved Eastern European brides and forged documents, but was convicted after a trial . A law firm made £20million in  Britain’s biggest sham marriage racket which let up to 2,000 illegal immigrants stay in the country. Solicitor Tevfick Souleiman, 39, and three colleagues flew women in from eastern European countries within the EU to marry non-EU citizens. Most couples met on the day of the wedding and needed an interpreter to translate their vows. Some of the grooms were Albanian career criminals suspected of murder, drugs trafficking and money laundering. The criminals would pay the law firm around £14,000 to arrange marriages. Often they would use fake identity documents to evade police at home. Souleiman and his colleagues Cenk Guclu, 41, Furrah Kosimov, 29 and Zafer Altinbas, 38, made up ‘love stories’ to fool officials. Last night a source told the Mail the ruse allowed ‘dangerous criminals to operate’ in Britain. ‘We believe this to be the largest marriage fraud ever committed in the UK,’ the source said. The scam was run between January 2004 and February 2012. Several brides were flown in each day and taken to registry offices across the country. They were paid off and told never to contact the ‘husbands’ again. At the Old Bailey yesterday Souleiman and Guclu were found guilty of receiving proceeds of crime and Kosimov guilty of money laundering. Souleiman claimed he had no knowledge of the scam, while immigration adviser Cenk Guclu, 41, tried to blame workmate Furrah Kosimov, 29, but was also found guilty. Kosimov, who went on the run before the case got underway, was convicted in his absence. Altinbas had earlier pleaded guilty to his role in the illegal plan. Tevfick Souleiman and Zafer Altinbas (right) were discovered to be part of a racket that created 'sham marriages' in order to obtain British passports . All three were found guilty of conspiracy to breach immigration law. As the verdicts were announced a woman . sobbed so loudly in the public gallery that Judge John Bevan QC had her . removed from the court. Soulemain blew kisses to supporters from the dock as he was found guilty. The gang ran their empire from the . offices of Souleiman's Souleiman GA law firm in north Londo. At one point they were flying in several brides a day on budget airlines including Ryanair and Aero Lithuania. Cenk Guclu tried to blame workmate Furrah Kosimov for the crime . The women would be housed in an east London tower block before being taken to registry offices across the country. Once married, their non-EU husbands . would have the right to live in the UK and claim benefits because of . their new status - and would usually be allowed to remain in the country . if they separated. 'That is the point of a sham marriage,' said prosecutor Nicholas Mather. 'That’s why it is a business, because people want to come and live and work in this country. 'Normally . if one was coming from a non-EU country there would be complicated and . difficult steps one would have to go through in order to be able to live . and work in this country. 'Generally, people can’t do that. We don’t have open borders in this country, except so far as EU countries are concerned. 'So . in many cases these people who engage in sham marriages would have no . chance at all of passing through the immigration system, either because . they don’t have the right skills or the right income.' Forged affidavits containing details of the couples’ supposed courtships were also included. In . one, Albanian Alban Spaho described how he met his Bulgarian . bride-to-be Petya Zlatanska while on a day out with friends in 2008. The affidavit said: 'We went to a cafe where our friends left us alone to get on with it. 'Petya was a bit shy but I eventually persuaded her to let me take her out. 'We . didn’t go to any of the usual Bulgarian or Albanian places in north . London but instead went to a really nice place in the West End. 'After three months I realised I wanted to be with her all the time and asked her to marry me.’ Another client recalled how he met his bride in a nightclub and proposed after a romantic Valentine's Day meal. The . were scripted by the lawyers, with some couples only coming face to . face at the registry office on the day they were married. The . racket was busted when suspicions were raised about the number of . couples marrying at Cambridge Registry Office, despite having no links . to the city. Police raided Souleiman GA’s offices and a lock-up rented by Kosimov, which contained thousands of files about the couplings. They had so many clients they ran out of bogus addresses and listed several couples as living in the same home. Many applicants also claimed to work at a takeaway store called Kebab Town. The . enterprise proved lucrative, with bank records showing thousands of . pounds being paid into personal accounts belonging to Guclu and . Altinbas. Souleiman studied . immigration law since the age of 15 and specialised in the Ankara . Agreement, which allows Turkish citizens limited rights to live and work . in the UK. He was raking in . a salary of nearly £50,000 after tax from legitimate work, the vast . majority of which involved clients of Turkish origin. The gang will be sentenced on Monday.","Gang flew in brides from eastern Europe and created 'touching love stories'

Bored of flowers and roses? Then how about a cucumber to show your loved one how much you care? Spanish vegetable farmers have grown heart-shaped cucumbers just in time for Valentine's Day. The farmers grow the cucumbers with specially-designed heart-shaped moulds so that when the cucumber is sliced, it produces perfect romantic slices. While they may be good in salads, they were actually designed as garnishes for drinks. Banffshire-based Hendrick's Gin came up with the idea as sliced cucumber is a popular garnish to serve in gin-based drinks,particularly in Spain where there are bars devoted to gin where customers choose their preferred gin, tonic and garnish. The Scottish drinks company approached the Tecnova Technology Centre at the University of Almeria which was looking at ways to promote cucumbers following the 2011 E.coli crisis. They then asked farmers to grow the veg into the desired shape. Bars in Valencia, Seville, Barcelona . and Madrid have been serving drinks with the heart-shaped cucumber, and . the company says it will extend the cucumbers to Britain if they prove . popular enough on the continent. Romantic: The cucumbers are grown in heart-shaped moulds so that they look just right in your gin and tonic . David . Piper, a Hendrick's spokesman, said: 'The giving of a red rose or . sharing of a glass of bubbly are pleasant enough ways to mark . Valentine's Day. 'But a gin and tonic complete with a most unusual garnish of heart-shaped cucumber slices is even better.

A mother who died from lung cancer could have been saved had doctors treated her three years earlier, her family have claimed. Linda Renshaw, 61, had a chest X-ray at the Royal Blackburn Hospital . in 2008 which showed the early signs of cancer. But she was nothing was followed up and she died in May 2011 after the disease spread to her brain. Before she died, the mother-of-three launched a medical . negligence legal battle, claiming she could have been saved had she received the appropriate care. Arthur Renshaw's wife Linda (pictured) died after her lung cancer went untreated for three years, allowing the disease to spread . She told her family she had instructed solicitors because 'she didn't want it to happen to anyone else'. The couple's case is one of 45 against . the trust launched by solicitors Manchester-based solicitors Pannone in . the last five years - 27 of which are still active. Last week the Government announced an . independent inquiry after the trust recorded higher than expected . mortality rates for two successive years. It is one of five trusts nationally to be investigated and was 13 per cent above expectations. Mrs Renshaw, who also had three step-children, had the initial chest X-ray at the Royal Blackburn . Hospital after she suffered a heart attack in July 2008. Her husband Arthur, 71, claims that four days . later, a doctor spotted the tumour and a note was sent to the ward she . had been on to follow it up. He said: 'They are supposed to have computer systems where the information was passed to the GP, but it wasn't logged.' Mr Renshaw, with daughter Stephanie, claims doctors failed to follow up his wife's cancer at an early stage . In 2010, Mrs Renshaw, who worked as a cleaner and lunch time assistant, went to her GP . and was told she was having seizures. After initially being treated for . sinus problems, she was sent to hospital for another X-ray. Mr Renshaw, of West Bradford, . Lancashire, said: 'The following day a . doctor came and said to her: ""I'm sorry to inform you that you have advanced lung cancer and it has spread to your brain"". 'We told him Linda had had an X-ray in . 2008 and he said ""yes, when you had that X-ray the doctor spotted the . early signs but nothing was followed up"". 'He gave her five months to live. I was numb, but Linda was full of hope that she would beat the cancer.' He added that his wife was so determined to fight the cancer that she turned to alternative medicine, spending £500 a month on treatments. Mr Renshaw said: 'Nothing can bring Linda back but she wanted me to fight for justice' Now he says East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust had admitted neglect and causation of death. He said: 'Linda instructed the solicitor because she didn't want it to happen to anyone else. He said: 'She made me promise to see it through to the end so that it didn't happen to another family.""Nothing can bring her back but she wanted me to fight for justice. 'I got called to a meeting with the clinical director. They said ""we failed you wife"". They have admitted neglect and causation of death. He claims an independent consultant said Mrs Renshaw could have been cured, saying: 'It's devastating. I will never get over it. We were looking forward to retiring.' Mrs Renshaw was buried in her mother of the bride outfit she had planned to wear for her daughter Tracy's wedding in July. Marged Berry, of Pannone Solicitors, said there had been a failure to follow up on a chest X-ray which clearly showed early cancerous changes in summer 2008. But Mrs Renshaw was not actually diagnosed until early 2011, by which time the cancer was terminal. She said: 'We are disturbed by the number of cases that we see. Arthur Renshaw's case is an example of that. It's such a simple error that could have meant that Mrs Renshaw survived. 'The trust has admitted breach of duty of care and conceded Mrs Renshaw would have lived, had she received the right treatment. 'The inquiry is welcomed because it will lead to a rethink of policies and procedures and better patient care. 'Although we have a substantial number of cases against East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, we can't draw any conclusions. We have to wait for the inquiry.' Lynn Wissett, deputy chief executive for East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'The trust has met with Mr Renshaw and a detailed investigation into his concerns was undertaken. 'We would again offer our sincere condolences to Mr Renshaw. The matter is now subject to litigation and the trust and the National Health Service Litigation Authority are working with Mr Renshaw's legal representatives.'","Linda Renshaw, 61, had a chest X-ray at Royal Blackburn Hospital .

A pensioner was left to lie in her own filth for weeks while a council-appointed carer cleaned around her. Janet Norton, 72, lay immobilised on her sofa for two months with a back injury, yet the carer appears to have ignored her desperate condition. Her shocked daughter Sharon Matthews discovered her mother at her south London home in December 2012 and alerted paramedics. The carer - who was given five days . training before starting work with Care UK - has been suspended after an . investigation was launched. Both Care UK and Merton Council have apologised for a 'service failure'. In August 2012 Mrs Norton was deemed by social services to be capable of looking after herself and her husband John, who is mentally impaired following a breakdown 20 years ago. From October her condition rapidly worsened but the carer failed to notice she was in severe pain, unable to move, and began to use the sofa as a toilet. Mrs Norton's daughter, Sharon Matthews, said: 'I had not seen mum and dad for three months and after a while I became suspicious because mum would never come to the phone. 'When I discovered what happened I was shocked and disgusted. The smell was unbelievable and there were flies everywhere. The shocking pictures taken by Mrs Norton's daughter are too disturbing to use. They show her entire back covered in excrement after she was forced to soil herself because she couldn't move. Hospital staff had to cut her clothes off her because they were drenched in urine and faeces. In the pictures, the skin on her buttocks is red raw and weeping from pressure sores, and she has other patches of raw skin up her back. Every toe on her right foot has turned yellow, and in some parts, black, showing infection and necrosis (death of flesh). Her left foot has also started to deteriorate in the same way. 'I called the ambulance and it took them two-and-half hours to get her out because she was in so much pain. They had to cut her clothes off because they were drenched in urine and faeces.' On the day Mrs Norton was discovered, her carer had written in his records: 'Washed the dishes, swept and mopped the floors. Kept Janet company for the remaining [sic].' The previous day, he wrote: 'Janet was on the sofa with her husband beside her. I swept the floors, washed the dishes and put them away. I kept them company for the remaining time of my visit.' Simon Williams, the council's director of community and housing, said: 'It is clear Mrs Norton's change in needs was not reported back. We regret we didn't know about it until December 17 when Mrs Matthews told us. 'It is really unfortunate this has happened. We are very sorry but we wouldn't like to cloud the fact there are really good care workers looking after vulnerable adults every day.' He said social care watchdog, the Care . Quality Commission, was informed of the case on Tuesday, but the council . has not asked for the police to investigate, nor will the council's . three-year contract with Care UK be reviewed. Mrs Norton lay immobilised for two months with a back injury on her sofa. The carer (not pictured) appears to have ignored her desperate condition . Her family say the carer failed to notice she was in severe pain and was unable to move from the sofa . In a statement, Care UK said: 'Both Care UK and Merton Council had assessed and were aware of the existing very poor state of Mr and Mrs Norton’s home and the extent of the care needs the couple already required before our care worker started to support the couple. 'Our care worker was contracted by the Council to attempt to clean and maintain the house, but, at the couple’s request, was not allowed to provide personal care such as assisting Mrs Norton’s mobility or hygiene requirements. 'Care UK doesn’t have the authority to determine or change the level of care provided to individuals by local authorities, but we are sorry that we were not able to reduce the obvious discomfort and distress that Mr and Mrs Norton and their family experienced. 'The local authority is responsible for deciding and reviewing care needs and only contracted Care UK to make some limited progress in preventing further deterioration in the state of the couple’s home, which we were able to do. 'On reflection and despite our limited role, we recognise that we, as well as the council, could have escalated the situation more quickly, and we have now jointly agreed more effective ways to raise concerns in this sort of extremely difficult and sensitive case.'","Janet Norton, 72, lay immobilised on sofa for two months with back injury .

'It was just like something was eating at my eye, I could not bear to look at the light. I am heartbroken. 'At first I thought there was a hair in my eye but the next day I had to go to the emergency hospital. 'I was given drops but it just got worse.' Mrs Scott bought a set of contact lenses from a UK company before travelling to her Spanish holiday home in Alicante in October last year. Mrs Scott (centre) spent three weeks in hospital and was attached to an intravenous drip after the disposable lens began burning her eyeball . But after it began affecting her eye, she was rushed to a specialist unit at the nearby Hospital Clinico San Juan. Surgeons battled for nearly a month to save her vision and she underwent three operations in an effort to clear the infection. But just before New Year's Eve last year medics were forced to remove the eye in a three-and-a-half hour procedure and June, who lives in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, has been left with no sight in her left eye. 'I was on antibiotics for three weeks and had to go to hospital every day from 9am to 5pm. It was absolutely horrendous and the pain was so awful I had to go in the middle of the night. 'We have to come back to England so that I can get a false eye but it is never going to be the same. 'My life has changed. I can't drive anymore and the pain I had to go through was horrendous. I was in a foreign hospital in agony but the foreign doctors were fabulous. 'I am due back to England in April and I am going to need further treatment.' Mrs Scott is now considering taking legal action against the contact lens supplier as she tried to get her life back on track. She said: 'I first used the contact lens in March last year and I had to go back to the opticians. I noticed a brown stain and after I took them back several more came, but they were the same.'

Sir Cliff Richard has admitted that he never wanted children because starting a family would have got in the way of his career. The 72-year-old star said that, while he believes he would have been a good father, he doesn’t regret his decision. Speaking to The Lady magazine, the singer, who is preparing to tour again, said: ‘Being completely honest, it’s never bothered me. 'I wouldn't have it any other way': Sir Cliff Richard, 72, has said he does not regret not having children . ‘My three sisters have children, and it’s been wonderful to watch them grow up, get married and start families of their own. ‘I’ve made sure I’ve always played a part in their lives. So while I think I would have been a good father, I’ve given myself to my family and I wouldn’t have it any other way. My “freedom” allows me to continue my career. 'Had I been married and with children I wouldn’t be able to do what I do now – I wouldn’t want to do what I do now.’ Sir Cliff had his first hit in 1958, when he was 18. He has gone on to sell more than 20million records in the UK and is the only artist to have had a No 1 record in each of the five decades from the 1950s to the 1990s. He is preparing to hit the road again in June for his UK Midsummer Nights tour. He has put his extraordinary longevity as a performer down to a strict diet and a punishing exercise regime as well as avoiding drink and drugs. Career-focused: Despite being linked to several women over the years - including former tennis player Sue Barker - the singer has remained single for much of his career . Young love: The singer wrote a letter to girlfriend Delia Wicks when he was 21 to tell her he had to put his pop career before any lasting relationship . And the singer, who is a committed Christian, has now admitted that as a young performer in the 1950s and 1960s he was so naive about drugs that he had no idea that other stars were freely using illegal substances backstage. However, he said he was never tempted to take drugs, fearing that it would end his career and stop him ‘living the dream’. ‘Growing up in the 1950s, the world was a very different place,’ he said. ‘Drugs weren’t as commonplace as they are now, but they were still around, I just didn’t know what they were and now when I think back I realise that the smell backstage wasn’t herbal cigarettes. ‘After ten years in that environment, I started to think, “Is this how I’m going to end up?” and I certainly didn’t want anything to cut my life short. ‘I was having a fantastic time performing. I’d have been devastated if anything had stopped me living my dream. ‘My faith has kept me sensible and shielded me from a lot of problems that someone with my fame could have encountered.’ Extraordinary longevity: Sir Cliff said he refused to let anything stop him from living his dream . Sir Cliff has remained single for much of his career, despite dating several women as a young star. He had a brief fling with Carol Costa, the ex-wife of his former Shadows bandmate Jet Harris, during the 1950s. He has also been linked to former tennis player and BBC presenter Sue Barker. Two years ago, it was also revealed that when he was 21 he had split from Delia Wicks, his girlfriend of 18 months, saying in a letter to her that he had to put his pop career before any lasting relationship. In the letter, dated October 1961, he wrote: ‘I couldn’t give up my career, besides the fact that my mother and sisters, since my father’s death, rely on me completely. ‘I have showbiz in my blood now and I would be lost without it.’","Childless star, 72, says he 'wouldn't have it any other way'

An entire town was in mourning today after Lolong, the world’s largest crocodile in captivity – and a huge money-spinner – died in its man-made lake of a mystery illness. The 21ft, one-tonne saltwater crocodile, which was captured less than 18 months ago by a team of brave men in the southern Philippines, was found lying upside down in its enclosure in an eco-tourism park. Lolong, believed to be more than 50 . years old, fell ill after swallowing a nylon cord about three weeks ago. He was left with nonstop diarrhoea, The Philippine Star reported. Lolong, named after a famed Philippines hunter, had been blamed for the deaths of several fishermen before its dramatic capture in the marshes near the town of Bunawan (population 35,000), 515 miles south east of Manila. Scroll down for video . 'Lolong,' the largest saltwater crocodile in captivity has died at his home in Bunawan of Agusan Del Sur province, southern Philippines. Villagers are devastated at the loss . Thirty men had spent three weeks trying to capture the huge reptile before they finally snared it in September 2011 using a dead pig as bait and throwing steel cables over it. A tractor was needed to haul it onto a trailer – but not before local people had crowded around the crocodile to pose for photos with their world-record catch. Since then, Lolong has been a star attraction at the tourism park and town councillors gleefully announced that their small town had finally found its place on the world map. But today many of the townsfolk were in tears on learning that Lolong had died within a year and a half of being moved to its new home. ‘We don’t know what happened to it,’ said the shocked Mayor, Edwin Elorde, who reportedly cradled the colossal creature in his arms before it died,. ‘Its death is a complete mystery and I have to admit that I’m really depressed. ‘I’ve come to love that crocodile. It brought fame and fortune to our town and, in a small way, to the Philippines.’ This September 2011 file picture shows the capture of Lolong. It was the largest crocodile in captivity, measuring 6.17 metres . Prize catch: Villagers pose with newly-captured beast. it was hunted after a spate of attacks on humans and livestock, officials said . Mr Elorde said that after the . crocodile’s capture  - which made international headlines – a special . eco-tourism park was created to house it. Local people and foreign tourists made special trips to the remote community to gaze in awe at the enormous creature. ‘We were planning to build a special road leading to the park because we were getting so many tourists, but now I’m not so sure whether we will proceed with it,’ said the Mayor. ‘Perhaps the plan will go ahead if we can catch more crocodiles – there are many more out there - but I can’t say whether they will have the same appeal as Lolong. ‘You only had to see him and you’d stand there staring as if under a spell.’ Colossus: Residents use their hands to measure Lolong, which is suspected of having attacked several people. It weighed 600 kg at the time of its capture . Tourists from far and wide flocked to see Lolong in his purpose-built enclosure in the town . When rangers at the park found Lolong . floating on its back they called for immediate help from Mr Alex . Collantes, a veterinarian who specialises in reptiles. He found that Lolong was still alive but . close to death and as a desperate measure he and park rangers immersed . it in lukewarm water. The region has been hit by unusually cold weather this month and Mr Collantes suggested this might have had something to do with the crocodile’s dire condition. Despite all efforts, however, Lolong was declared dead a few hours later. As word spread through the town, many people gathered in the streets and wept. Lolong in his enclosure. This picture gives an impression of the true scale of the enormous creature . But Mayor Elorde said all was not lost – for there are now plans to have Lolong stuffed and put on display. ‘I think it might still attract people even in death because it is such an enormous creature,’ said Mr Elorde. ‘I think even the locals who have seen it when it was alive will come back – they aren’t going to let him slip from their memories, of that I’m sure.’ An autopsy is expected today to determine the cause of death.","Lolong the crocodile is mourned by villagers in remote Philippine town .

Angry: Jeremy Paxman's scathing criticism of the BBC's handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal is to be removed from transcripts in a BBC inquiry . Scathing criticism by Jeremy Paxman about how the BBC dealt with the Savile crisis is to be removed from transcripts of evidence given to the corporation’s inquiry into the affair. The Newsnight host’s full, potentially explosive, opinions on his bosses’ handling of the scandal have been ‘redacted’ for legal reasons amid fears they were potentially defamatory. In addition, evidence provided by the global news director Peter Horrocks - responsible for the World Service - has also been removed for similar reasons. Both men were said to have been very critical of how senior BBC News bosses handled the investigation into Jimmy Savile after his death in October 2011. Their evidence is contained within thousands of witness statements, e-mails and text messages gathered by former head of Sky News Nick Pollard last year. He published an interim review last December into why Newsnight dropped its probe into Savile’s abuse of young girls in December 2011, two months after his death and shortly before the corporation broadcast Christmas specials about the DJ. The devastating allegations for some of his victims ended up being screened by ITV last October and triggered an avalanche of claims from women that they, too, had been a victim of Savile. Next week Mr Pollard is due to publish more of the evidence in his final report. Staff at the BBC have been given access to lawyers at the corporation’s expense before final publication to check the material. This is because many of the witnesses did not realise that their evidence would end up being published. Despite the decision to redact, some of Mr Paxman’s embarrassing criticisms of the handling of the Savile case are already in the public domain. After Newsnight’s then editor Peter Rippon wrote a blog last October explaining the BBC’s handling of the story, Paxman emailed him to say that the blog ‘doesn’t answer all of the accusations laid against us’. He continued: ’I have to say, I think we make a problem for ourselves by running away from this story.' Removed: Evidence provided by the global news . director Peter Horrocks (left) - responsible for the World Service - has also . been removed after thousands of emails, witness statements and text messages were gathered by former head of Sky news Nick Pollard, right, last year . He added ‘It raises questions about the way in which the claims of child abuse victims are treated’ and ‘It raises serious questions about journalistic ethics – different burdens of proof for the living and the dead – which are slap-bang in our terrain.‘ . The redaction has emerged as it was also disclosed that the Corporation’s most high-profile woman executive has accepted a new post just days before the release of the updated review into the BBC’s handling of the Saville scandal. Helen Boaden, who is director of news, has accepted a new post as the corporation’s radio chief. Confirmation of her new role as director of audio and music follows months of speculation about her future and her ability to keep her job. Scathing: Both Paxman and Horricks are said to have been highly critical of the BBC's handling of an investigation into allegations against Sir Jimmy Savile (pictured) It was initially thought that if she left the BBC she would demand a huge compensation payment and she had engaged lawyers to help her answer Mr Pollard’s questions. Miss Boaden has already been heavily criticised for failing to tackle the ‘meltdown’ that ensued in parts of the news department over the abandoned news story into Savile’s abuse. The first Pollard report was published in December. But the second - out next week - is expected to include not just testimonies but also emails and text messages. BBC insiders admit that some of the material is likely to be deeply embarrassing to a number of the corporation’s senior executives. Miss Boaden is understood to have been told last week that incoming director general Lord Hall would like her to make the switch to radio. At the height of the Savile crisis the BBC news chief temporarily ‘stepped aside’ from her £340,000 a year role, and it was later revealed she had at one point offered to resign. In his interim report in December, Mr Pollard said Miss Boaden ‘should have taken greater responsibility’. He said he was ‘surprised’ she did not take ‘a more proactive role’ particularly given that a ‘significant part of the division she headed’ was in ‘virtual meltdown’. An insider said last night of Miss Boaden’s move: ‘She has accepted. It is a done deal.’","Lawyers fear that Jeremy Paxman's comments could be defamatory .

Despite crucial tips that led authorities to find Christopher Dorner, it has been revealed that nobody will be able to claim the $1.2million reward in the case of the killer ex-cop. The rogue former police officer is believed dead after he was cornered in a burning cabin in the San Bernardino National Forest on Tuesday after a furious gunbattle with law enforcement officers. Likely beneficiaries of the reward would have been Jim and Karen Reynolds, who surprised Dorner, who had been staying in an upstairs room in their condo near Big Bear Lake. Scroll down for video . Ordeal: Karen and Jim Reynolds say that they surprised Dorner when they walked into one of the units they own near Big Bear Lake - where he had been staying . Big reward: Business leaders, police unions and governments across Southern California have offered a $1million reward for the capture of Christopher Dorner . Destroyed: Dorner is believed dead after he had taken refuge in a cabin that later burned to the ground . But the couple told reporters on Wednesday night that the reward would not be given because Dorner was neither arrested nor convicted in a trial, a stipulation of the cash sum. When pressed about the reward by reporters, Mrs Reynolds said: 'No one is getting that because he needed to be captured and convicted.' The Reynolds, who were tied up and had their heads wrapped in pillowcases, were able to break free after Dormer had stolen their car and fled the home. The call set Dorner's final hours in motion when the car . was spotted by game wardens, who pursued it until Dorner crashed - and . he fled to another cabin, which is now ravaged by fire. The couple came forward to clear up earlier reports that it was their housekeepers who had surprised Dorner and were tied up in the home. Lucky to be alive: Rick Heltebrake was carjacked by Dorner and says the revenge-bent former cop pointed an assault rifle at his head, but allowed him to flee with his life - and his dog Suni . Killer: Dorner, pictured in a January surveillance tape, reportedly shot two deputies on Tuesday as tried to escape out of the back door of the cabin, killing one of them . But Dorner encountered one more . person before his last stand - a driver whose pick-up truck Dorner stole . moments before the gunfight with officers. The motorist, 61-year-old Rick Heltebrake, told the Los Angeles Times, that it is he who deserves the reward after he had called authorities to notify them about Dorner's latest movements. He told the paper: 'Someone owes me $1 million. It was my call that led the officers to him.' But he did say he was willing to share the reward with anyone else who may have helped authorities catch up with Dorner. 'I know there were two other women involved and I don’t mind parting it three ways.' Police departments, local governments, . business leaders and police unions pool their money to offer a $1million . reward two days before Dorner's capture. Hiding under their noses: Dorner was discovered in a condo half a mile from a temporary command center . According to KCAL-TV, the reward was upped to $1.2million after donations by AEG, the Los Angeles Dodgers and various . business leaders and law enforcement groups. But as TMZ reported, a technicality in the . wording of the reward offer would mean that no one is eligible to receive it. LA . City Council sources told the site that the legislative analyst and the . city attorney were at odds earlier in the day about how the reward . offer should be interpreted. In the days leading up to the final showdown, Dorner gained national attention for his he was on the run and an bizarre online manifesto in which he detailed his plot to kill specific police officers. His writings also included various shoutouts to celebrities, including Charlie Sheen, Larry David and Tim Tebow. Los Angeles officials appealed to the public for help catching him after he killed three people, and several rewards were established to find Dorner.

Enabled: Confessed serial killer Israel Keyes was given a razor blade in his Alaska jail cell allowing him to commit suicide in December it's been revealed . A razor blade was mistakenly issued to confessed serial killer Israel Keyes in his jail cell allowing him to slash his wrists and commit suicide, the Alaska Department of Corrections has admitted. Keyes was found dead in his cell on Dec. 2, months before he was to have gone on trial for the 2012 slaying of 18-year-old Anchorage barista Samantha Koenig. The razor was never found. Outraged by this latest report, Ms Koenig’s family are calling the security lapse no mistake after only three months earlier Keyes, believed responsible for at least eight murders across the U.S., was found possessing an object modified into a handcuff key. That discovery heightened Keyes’ security, segregating him from other inmates and subjecting him to daily . strip searches and cell searches. ‘I . don’t think it was mistaken at all,’ Ms Koenig’s father James Koenig . angrily reacted to Keyes’ supplied razor. ‘How do you mistakenly give . someone in segregation a real razor blade?’ He . accuses the Corrections Department of robbing his family of their day . in court, on Wednesday saying he doesn’t believe the official version . released by the agency. Keyes . slit his left wrist with a razor blade and tied a noose around his neck . and right foot, according to the Correction’s report, which says the . exact cause of death is unknown although it has been classified as a . suicide. Justice: Family of 18-year-old Samantha Koenig who was abducted from a coffee shop, raped and murdered by Keyes, he has admitted, say he wrongly escaped justice through his own suicide . Abduction: Video surveillance seen here captures the moment Keyes approached Koenig in the coffee shop and forced her outside and into his parked Silverado . The state had previously denied an open records request from The Associated Press for details of events surrounding Keyes’ death. Corrections spokeswoman Kaci Schroeder told the AP that officials later decided to take another look at the case and see what could be released publicly. Schroeder said officials are not discussing what disciplinary actions, if any, were taken, over the lapse. However, she said because of this, any restriction for inmates are being posted on the cell doors in addition to being noted in a prisoner log. Before he died, Keyes told investigators he had killed Koenig and at least seven other people across the country, including Bill and Lorraine Currier of Essex, Vt. Investigators believe there could be more victims. Keyes was set for a March trial in federal court in the abduction and killing of Koenig. Authorities aren't certain when Keyes' crime spree began or ended. But they have a haunting image of his last known victim. Snippets of a surveillance video show the first terrifying moments of Koenig's abduction. Keyes is seen as a shadowy figure in ski mask and hood outside Common Grounds, a tiny Anchorage coffee shack then partially concealed from a busy six-lane highway by mountains of snow. More victims: Keyes is believed responsible for at least eight murders across the country, including Bill and Lorraine Currier of Vermont, Bill's mother and his wife Lorraine seen here . It's February 1, 2012, about 8pm, closing time. Koenig is shown handing Keyes a cup of coffee, then backing away with her hands up, as if it's a robbery. The lights go out and Keyes next appears as a fuzzy image climbing through the drive-thru window.Authorities outlined his next steps: . Monster: After Keyes killed Koenig he sent her family a picture of her body that made them believe she was still alive if they sent him ransom money . Keyes forced Koenig to his Silverado; he'd already bound her hands with zip ties and gagged her. He hid her in a shed outside his house, turned on loud music so no one could hear if she screamed, then returned to the coffee shack to retrieve scraps of the restraints and get her phone. On February 2, Keyes raped and strangled Koenig. He left her in that shed, flew to Houston and embarked on a cruise, returning about two weeks later. He then took a photo of Koenig's body holding a February13 newspaper to make it appear she was alive. Keyes wrote a ransom note on the back, demanding $30,000 be placed in her account. He texted a message, directing the family to a dog park where the note could be found. Her family deposited some money from a reward fund. The abduction gripped Anchorage as investigators held out hope that she remained alive. Keyes was arrested in March in Lufkin, Texas. He had sought a ransom and used Koenig’s debit card throughout his travel across country. Three weeks after the arrest, Koenig’s dismembered body was found in a frozen lake north of Anchorage. Koenig and the Curriers were the only victims named by Keyes. Admittance: The murder of Bill and Lorraine Currier were the only other murders Keyes specifically admitted to outside of Koenig's . Keyes was in state custody in Anchorage because there are no federal prisons in Alaska. But as those who knew Keyes revealed, his secret double-life was never once hinted at or revealed by him. ‘I never got any bad, weird, scary, odd vibe from him in any way, shape or form,’ says Paul Adelman, an Anchorage attorney who first hired Keyes as a handyman in 2008. Keyes' live-in girlfriend also was floored to learn of his double life, according to David Kanters, her friend. ‘He had everyone fooled,’ Kanters told The Associated Press in an email. ‘THAT is the scary part. He came across as a nice normal guy.’ (She did not respond to numerous requests for comment.) Shock: Family and friends of Keyes say there was nothing to lead them to believe he had such a secretive second life as a self-admitted serial killer . The corrections report says Keyes was last seen alive at 10:13 p.m. on Dec. 1. A number of security checks were conducted periodically throughout the night and early morning. Security officers are required to look into each cell and verify the prisoner is present and their status, the report says. ‘Procedures . call for security staff to visually observe the prisoner’s uncovered . skin. Keyes’ death was not observed during those security checks,’ the . report says. At 5:57 . a.m., Dec. 2, an official found what appeared to be blood along Keyes’ bunk and floor. The report says this was only noticed after lights came . on; before that, an LED nightlight in the overhead fixture was the only . light source. Medical personnel were called, and Keyes was declared dead at 6:13 a.m. Digging for clues: In this April 12, 2012 photo, state police investigators sift through dirt and debris at a dig site off Vermont 15 near Lang Farm in Essex, Vermont . State police investigators paused to allow a dog to inspect dirt and debris at the dig site off Vermont 15 near Lang Farm in Essex, Vermont . Keyes attempted to escape from the federal courthouse on May 23, 2012. After that, enhanced security measures were used on Keyes, including full restraints, a two-officer escort any time he was out of the cell, and restrictions on possession of razors and pencils. He also was subjected to daily strip searches and cell searches. On Sept. 11, the report says, Keyes was found guilty of possessing an object which had been modified as a handcuff key. A disciplinary board found him guilty, and he had to serve 60 days — with 45 days suspended — in punitive segregation. That sentence began Nov. 28, and his access to personal property was restricted.","Israel Keyes is believed to have killed at least eight people across the U.S. before taking his own life in December .

A research scientist suffering from cervical cancer was saved thanks to a drug she helped to develop. Dr Hayley Farmer, 39, works for Cancer Research UK as part of a team responsible for clinical trials on new medicines and vaccines. She was part of the office that was working on Cisplatin - a chemotherapy drug being tested on different types of cancer. Cancer Research worker Hayley Farmer was cured of cervical cancer with a drug she had helped to develop . Dr Farmer said she had been motivated to work for Cancer Research UK in the first place because she had recently lost her grandmother to cancer . But as she carried out her work, Dr Farmer had no idea she might need the treatment herself - until a routine smear test in 2007 revealed she had cervical cancer. The cancer was already too advanced for surgery and Dr Farmer was treated with radiotherapy followed by Cisplatin. Dr Farmer, from Bristol, was given the all clear from cancer last year thanks to the pioneering drug. She said: 'I have always been very passionate about what I do and why I do it. 'I wanted to work for Cancer Research UK in the first place because I had recently lost my grandmother to cancer. 'But now I have had my own experience it makes me so grateful for doing the job I do. 'It was quite surreal when I was first told, I see the cancer work every day, although it is very different when it is you.' Cisplatin is administered via a drip . Dr Farmer worked on the drug as part of a team at Cancer Research UK's head office in London. She said she found her cancer experience 'positive' and used fighting the disease as a chance to take time off work and go travelling. Dr Farmer added that she feels lucky to be in a country where cancer screening is available to pick up cases like hers. She said: 'I am appreciative of all the patients who go through clinical trials. In some cases it doesn't help them, but it helps people in the future. 'For me there is a personal connection because if it had not been for people going through clinical trials I might not be here. 'We did some of the early work on the drug I got and that really does put it in perspective - if it wasn't for people doing that 20 years ago I wouldn't be here.' Dr Farmer has raised more than £14,000 for Cancer Research and even climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in aid of the charity.

He puts up with being poked and prodded by hundreds of students seeking to find out what's wrong with him. But then Stan isn't your average sick person. He's a 'human patient simulator' who can be programmed to display symptoms from a variety of maladies. Scroll down for video . Stan can be used in a series of real-life scenarios that medical students can expect to encounter as doctors . Robot patient 'Stan' is worked on by anesthetist Dr Donna Fraser at the Scottish Clinical Simulation Centre. Stan's lungs physically consume oxygen and produce CO2 . Stan's the man: The high-tech mannequin has numerous functions . The sophisticated robot breathes (he takes in oxygen and expels carbon dioxide), has a pulse, and an arm that can receive an IV. He can also have blood pressure readings taken and has reactive eyes that dilate in response to light. His vital signs appear on a real clinical monitor and change in accordance to treatment. Most importantly, he can be controlled by computer to react to various treatments second by second. For instance, he can respond to procedures such as CPR, intravenous medication and ventilation. In this way, Stan gives medical students valuable insight into handling real-life scenarios and crucially, if they make a mistake, nobody dies. Stan, made from hard and soft rubberised plastic, takes pride of place at the newly-opened Scottish Clinical Simulation Centre. Underneath the casing, he  consists of various wires, motors, tubes, hoses, speakers and computer chips. Anaesthetist Dr Donna Fraser, said the centre based at Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert would provide useful practical experience for students. 'Learning from a text book is very different from having equipment in your hand, people talking to you and machines making noises,' she said. Stan displaying a nasty leg wound.

A toddler's mother was overjoyed today after her son was given the all-clear from four tumours despite doctors first suggesting he just had constipation. Sophie Maloney refused to accept the initial diagnosis on her son Oliver and a local GP said that the lump in his tummy could be to do with his bladder. An MRI scan revealed he had a large tumour on his prostate, rib, and others on his spine and left thigh. Scroll down for video . In remission: Oliver with his mother Sophie Maloney at home in Nottingham. He was treated with the colon cancer drug Avastin . He was accepted on an international drugs trial of Avastin and has now been given the all clear, after the tumours disappeared. Avastin is more commonly used to treat bowel cancer and breast cancer that has spread to other sites in the body. When his parents Sophie and Simon Lee, 37, first took Oliver to hospital with stomach pain in November 2011, doctors thought he had constipation. But Ms Maloney from Nottingham told doctors at the Queen's Medical Centre she was sure it was something more serious. Doctors then found the tumours which were diagnosed as rhabdomyosarcoma, a type of soft tissue sarcoma - a cancer that starts in muscles. There are only around 60 cases of this type of tumour in the UK each year. Ollie, pictured in hospital in December 2011 (l) and August 2012 (r) went through nine cycles of chemotherapy . Team Ollie: Sophie and Simon raised money for the Queen's Medical Centre where Oliver was being treated . Sophie, 38, said: 'Our whole world fell apart, I can still remember the consultant telling us the news. It was awful. 'I thought our world had ended - my legs gave way with shock. It was a bit of a lottery whether he would get accepted on to the drug trial. 'We knew there was not a lot known about this drug, but we thought it was worth a shot. 'We were really pleased that he got on it, we wanted to give him the best chance possible.' Ollie went through nine cycles of intensive chemotherapy and the new cancer drug eradicated most the tumours in his body and reduced the one on his prostate down to 1cm. Further focused radiotherapy saw that cancer disappear as well. His consultant Professor David Walker said: 'The results of the drug are yet to be collated, but Oliver was able to reap the benefits of being part of that research. 'The Government invested heavily into research so that cancer sufferers have the best opportunity to have the best cancer drugs available.'

"By . Claire Bates . PUBLISHED: . 05:01 EST, 12 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:54 EST, 12 February 2013 . A newborn baby's life has been saved after doctors 'froze' his body for four whole days. Edward Ives was born with just a five per cent chance of survival due to a condition that caused his rate to race twice as fast as normal. But he has made an amazing recovery after doctors rapidly cooled down his little body. Claire with her son Edward: He was on the brink of death are his heart started racing at over 300 beats per minute . Doctors cooled Edward's body from 37C to 33.3C . When Edward was born in August last year, he was diagnosed with a condition called Supraventricular Tachycardia. It caused his heart to race at over 300 beats per minute - compared to the usual 160 bpm. This reduced blood flow to his vital organs and left Edward on the brink of death. Then medics suggested they wrap Edward in a blanket filled with a cold gel and allow his temperature to drop from 37C to 33.3C. His mother, Claire Ives, 29, said: 'It was horrible to see him lying there freezing in nothing but a nappy. 'He was heavily sedated so didn't move much, and he was cold to touch - it looked like he was dead. 'All I wanted to do was scoop him up and give him a warm cuddle. I just had to keep reminding myself that it was saving his life.' The doctors at University College London Hospital cooled Edward for two days straight, allowing him to be brought up to a normal temperature when his heart beat slowed. But when his heart began to race once more, doctors again had to cool the little boy down for two further days. 'It was even worse the second time,' said Mrs Ives. 'I thought he was out of the woods but then his heart went into a bad rhythm again. I remember asking the nurse if he was going to die and she told me that he might. 'We just had to live minute by minute; we couldn't look ahead because we didn't know what the future held.' Edward's body was twice cooled over two days . Out of the woods: Although Edward could have further heart-racing episodes they are likely to be harmless . Mrs Ives first became suspicious that something was wrong when she was 35 weeks pregnant. 'I had one of those things where you could listen to your baby's heartbeat. I did it one evening and noticed that his heart was beating really fast. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a heart condition featuring episodes of an abnormally fast heart rate. It often emerges during childhood. The heart will suddenly start racing, then stop or slow down abruptly. Episodes can last from seconds to days in rare cases. They may occur regularly, several times a day, or infrequently, once or twice a year. The heart rate may be as high as 250 beats per minute, but is usually between 140 and 180 (a normal adult heartbeat should be 60-100 beats per minute at rest). It's caused by abnormal electrical impulses that start suddenly in the . upper chambers of the heart, upsetting the organ's natural rhythm. It causes the heart muscle to contract so fast that it can't relax between contractions. This reduces the amount of blood being pumped . around the body, which can cause dizziness and shortness of breath. Episodes often happen for no obvious reason. However, they may be triggered by a . change in posture, exertion, emotional upset, coffee or alcohol. In the vast majority of cases, attacks of SVT are harmless, do not last long and settle on their own without treatment. SOURCE: NHS . 'I'm a nurse, so I knew it wasn't right, but I thought maybe the machine had been wrong, so I went for a lie down for a bit and then tried again. 'It was normal the next time but I was still worried, so I called the Lister Hospital. 'I was being scanned and all of a sudden the sonographer went off and came back with lots of senior members of staff. 'Before I knew where I was they'd told me that my baby was really poorly, and that I should ring my husband because they needed to deliver straight away. 'They told me there was a very high chance that he'd die. All I could think of was how I was going to tell my other children, Joscelyn and Hayden - they'd been so excited to have a baby brother. 'The doctors were all ready to give me a caesarean section when at the last minute they'd been told by doctors at Great Ormond Street to give me a medication that could slow the baby's heart beat.' Mrs Ives was on the medication for two days before being referred to Great Ormond Street. 'When we got to Great Ormond I went for another scan and then they took us into a room to explain what was going on. 'As soon as my husband Phillip and I walked into the room we saw a box of tissues on a side table. We knew then it wasn't going to be good news.' Doctors explained to the couple that . the cause of Edward's SVT was unknown, and the best thing to do would be . to deliver and treat him directly. Mrs Ives was transferred to University College London Hospital where Edward was delivered. 'It was three hours before I got to see him and he was hooked up to so many machines. It was just awful,' she said. 'Then . later that night doctors came up to tell me that he was in a really bad . way, and all they could do was try and shock his heart, and then cool . him down.' Welcome home: Baby Edward with parents Claire and Phillip and siblings Jocelyn and Hayden in London . Claire, who is a nurse, realised something was wrong after measuring her baby's heart rate in the womb . Doctors decided to cool Edward in order to slow his heart rate down and ensure his organs would not be deprived of oxygen. In total Edward spent four days wrapped in a blanket that lowered his body temperature, whilst also being shocked five times with a defibrillator, which is an electric current directed into his heart. It was on the evening of the fourth day of cooling that Edward's heart rate finally returned to normal. 'I couldn't believe it, I was absolutely overjoyed' said Mrs Ives. 'I wanted to be cautious, because I was aware that he could go into an abnormal rhythm again, but it was amazing.' Medics then began to warm Edward's body by half a degree every 12 hours, and the youngster slowly began to improve. 'As soon as his heart started beating normally everything began to improve. He'd been really puffy because his kidneys weren't working, but all of a sudden he looked like a normal baby again.' A month later, after being referred back to The Lister Hospital, Edward was finally allowed to return home to his family. 'When I walked through my front door with Edward in his arms, it felt like a dream come true. 'There had been so many times when we thought he'd never come home. It's just been wonderful.' Six-month-old Edward is now a healthy and happy baby, back at home with his family. SVT is caused by abnormal electrical impulses that start suddenly in the . upper chambers of the heart. They may be triggered by exertion or stress. Although it is possible Edward may have further heart-racing episodes, they will most likely be harmless and not last long.","Blood wasn't flowing efficiently to Edward Ives's organs .

Sunbathing in her family's cottage garden on a glorious day in July, Courtenay Zurenko, felt happy and content. Two months before she had given birth to her son Riley and she and her husband Joe loved being first-time parents. 'Life was wonderful,' Courtenay told Mail Online. 'We were blessed by becoming pregnant very quickly. I had always wanted to be a mother, so I was overjoyed that it was a reality.' Yet within a month, the 29-year-old from . a Chicago suburb was close to death after suffering three terrifying . seizures in hospital - and it could all have been caused by that . afternoon out in the summer heat. Happy and healthy again: Courtenay with her son Riley, who she was too weak to hold during her illness . Courtenay had developed a rare auto-immune condition called dermatomyositis. The condition, which affects only one in 100,000 people causes painful skin rashes, muscle weakness and difficulty swallowing. It can kills up to five per cent of people who get it. But when Mrs Zurenko first started to develop a purplish rash on her chest both she and her doctors were stumped. 'I first thought it was sunburn but it had spread and become very itchy,' she recalls. 'I went to a dermatologist who ran tests and they thought it might be lupus (where the immune system attacks healthy cells) but they weren't sure.' 'Then one evening I tried to pick Riley up and nearly dropped him because my arms were so weak. I went to numerous outpatient departments and every doctor ran blood tests, but they all came back negative.' Mrs Zurenko sunbathing after giving birth to Riley in July 2011, just before it triggered a terrifying autoimmune condition . At its worst Mrs Zurenko couldn't swallow and had to be fed through a tube. Her hair fell out during treatment . Mrs Zurenko was finally diagnosed with the muscle condition at Loyola University Medical Center after rheumatologist Dr Ruth Kadanoff noticed a scaly rash on her knuckles - a typical symptom of the disease. Courtenay's immune system was mistakenly attacking her own healthy tissue so she was put on a course of steroids to suppress her immune system. At first, the mother-of-one began to improve although she said she still felt like she 'had cement in every limb.'  But a week later she took a dramatic turn for the worse. Her eyes became swollen and she found she couldn't swallow. 'It was very scary. I had already lost a lot of weight and I didn't know what would happen next,' she said. 'I didn't want to do too much research as I was afraid of reading worst case scenarios. Thankfully my parents lived nearby and could look after Riley, while my husband worked and took me to hospital.' Mrs Zurenko was admitted back into hospital in October 2011 after tests revealed she had extremely high blood pressure. This had been triggered by a rare reaction to the steroids she had received to suppress her immune system. It was when she was talking to her husband in her hospital room that she had her first of three terrifying seizures. 'I remember feeling light-headed and then the TV seemed to swirl in front of me,' she recalled. 'I said: ""Joe, something is terribly wrong, help me,"" and then I blacked out.' Brain scan: The September image shows areas of swelling in the brain, which were caused by extremely high blood pressure. The image from November shows the brain after the condition had been resolved . Mrs Zurenko's chest starting to heal after she suffered an MRSA infection from scratching the rash on her chest . Minutes later she had a second . seizure and was rushed to intensive care where she had her third . episode. Her husband could only watch and wait to see if she would . recover. Dermatomyositis is a rare inflammatory disease marked by muscle weakness and a distinctive purpley-red skin rash. It is an auto-immune disorder, which means the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue.  The exact cause is unknown. The condition affects one in 100,000 people but is twice as common in women than in men. It can occur at any age but usually affects adults aged 40-60. The main symptoms are...: Rash across the face, eyelids, knuckles, elbows, knees and chest. : Progressive muscle weakness involving muscles closest to the trunk, such as hips, shoulders, upper arms and neck . : Difficulty swallowing and weight loss . It is treated with anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids and drugs to suppress the immune system. The condition can disappear on its own in about a fifth of patients. Most patients survive but may be left with weakness and disability. In around five per cent of cases it can progress quickly leading to death. 'The doctors . told me that if I had had a fourth seizure I could have been left with . severe brain damage or even died,' Mrs Zurenko said. An . MRI revealed her high blood pressure had caused lesions to form on her . brain, which had triggered the seizures. Thankfully, after three days . she began to recover. As . her strength slowly returned the mother was checked 'from head to toe' to see whether she was suffering from any other conditions such as . cancer, but these all came back clear. It was then that doctors revealed what they thought had caused her ordeal - a simple case of sunburn back in July. 'That . afternoon when I had enjoyed laying out in the sun the temperature was . in the 80s (25C-30C). I had put sunscreen on but coming inside I . remember I was a little pink,' she said. Research shows that when your skin is exposed to ultraviolet light it . may cause many of your skin cells to die. These dead cells are powerful . stimulators of the immune system, and in Mrs Zurenko's case may have caused her body to overeact. 'Amazingly . they said that was what could have triggered it, perhaps also because . my immune system was low from after having my baby. It just seemed so . incredible.' Mrs Zurenko was put on an IVIG - a . blood product chock full of immunoglobulin (antibodies that fight . disease) taken from the plasma of hundreds of donors. 'I got so much better after that,' she said. 'I . had spent my first week in ICU, then my second week out in a normal . ward although I couldn't eat food without help or move myself. 'By the third week I was in the rehabilitation section. I was sitting up in my chair and could go to the bathroom with help. 'The day I could eat on my own they brought me a piece of chocolate cake.' Rehabilitation: Mrs Zurenko with the chocolate cake she was given the first day she was cleared to eat by herself again (l) and (r) in a wheelchair on the day she was discharged from hospital . Out of hospital: Courtenay, her husband Joe and son Riley lived with her parents for a few months while she regained her strength . Mrs Zurenko left hospital in a wheelchair and bought a wig as her various treatments had caused her hair to fall out. She started physio exercises while staying with her parents. 'Before long I was dressing myself and although I needed help with Riley I could pick him up again, which was just wonderful,' she said. But she still had an emotional battle to fight. 'I had felt very depressed when I became ill as I couldn't look after Riley,' she said. 'And after I left hospital I was very anxious that I would have another seizure.' When she went back to the hospital . six weeks later she was thrilled to be told her lesions had gone and . helped her to focus on getting better. 'The last year has been wonderful,' she said. 'My . husband, son and I moved back from my parents to our own house, my hair . has grown back and a few months ago I started working part time in a . gift shop. Courtenay back at home with her husband Joe and son Riley. She was wearing a wig in this photo after suffering from hair loss . Mrs Zurenko is now working part-time at a gift shop and says her illness has given her a new positive perspective on life . 'I also wrote a book about my experience. I realised that I could connect with other people from talking about my own battle and hearing what other people had gone through. It gave me a new perspective and I really appreciate what I used to think of as chores. 'Although I've had a few skin flare-ups I'm learning how to manage the stress that can cause them.' Courtenay's biggest joy is that she can look after her son again. 'Riley is 18-months-old now and is very energetic, but I can keep up!' she said. 'Just over a year ago I couldn't see any light at the end of the tunnel, now I appreciate the peace and joy a new perspective has given me.'

A super slimmer who shed four dress sizes after being dumped by boyfriends for being too fat has finally found love - just in time for Valentine's Day. Marie Mace, 30, said her relationships never lasted long because of her wobbly waistline. After deciding she couldn't face another Valentine's Day alone, she ditched the junk food and embarked on a strict diet and exercise regime. Marie Mace was determined to lose weight after she was treated poorly by several ex boyfriends. She now wears size 12 jeans, down from a size 20 . She found that once the pounds started melting away, old boyfriends begged her to take them back.But newly svelte Marie snubbed her shallow ex-partners and has now found love with Jamie, 32. The loved-up couple met on an internet dating site and have booked a romantic holiday to Singapore for next month. Ms Mace, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, said: 'I've always been a big girl, and although I tried not to admit it to myself, I knew that my size was ruining my life. 'Boyfriends never stayed interested for long - and deep down, I knew when they split with me it was because of my size. One long term boyfriend had an affair, and I know my weight played a part in it. 'One ex even told me that he wouldn't take me out to restaurants or bars because he was too ashamed to be seen with me, so we had to stay in my house. I knew I couldn't carry on like I was.' Marie Mace on holiday in Tunisia in May last year, before she decided to slim down . 'He loves me for me': Marie Mace with her boyfriend Jamie Adams, who she met through a dating website . The income advisor suffers from Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, and so gains weight easily while finding it difficult to lose. She was advised to lose weight by her doctor after tipping the scales at 16st 1lb. 'I always avoided scales, so when my doctor told me how much I weighed I was shocked and embarrassed,' Ms Mace said. She signed up to a short-term low-calorie diet plan, that included shakes, soups, bars and porridge. Ms Mace signed up to the Cambridge plan last June, and by October she had shed three and a half stone - and replaced her size 20 jeans with slinky size 12 dresses. She said: 'It was tough going to start with, but in the first week I lost eight pounds - and from then on I was hooked.' Polycystic ovary syndrome affects millions of women in the UK. Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless cysts that are . no bigger than 8mm each. Normal ovaries have only about half this number . of cysts. The cysts are under-developed follicles which contain eggs that . haven't developed properly. Often in PCOS, these follicles are unable to . release an egg, meaning ovulation doesn't take place. Symptoms include problems getting pregnant, irregular periods, weight gain, acne and excessive body hair. The exact cause is unknown but it can run in families. Overweight women are at greater risk of developing PCOS, which could be because they produce higher than average levels of insulin. Some women with PCOS do go on to have children.

She said: 'After losing the weight, . ex partners started coming crawling out of the woodwork - but I didn't . want to have anything to do with them.

It feels great to be in a happy relationship . with someone who loves me for me,' she said. She added: 'My polycystic ovary syndrome always made me doubt I would be able to have children, as that was what was advised by my doctor.

A man who blamed ‘minorities and African Americans’ for rising crime in his neighborhood was arrested February 13 on charges of bank robbery after running back to that very same neighborhood. Back in June, the Buffalo, New York CBS affiliate was covering an arson in the city’s Old First Ward neighborhood. A fire the FBI believed was set intentionally and with racist motivation. Pot meet kettle: William Shanahan is charged with robbing a bank near the neighborhood he once famously said was over-run with criminal minorities . The station interviewed William Shanahan, a 30-plus-year resident of the area,  to get his thoughts on the fire. Slimy irony: Shanahan, here in his mugshot, has been arrested multiple times but blames 'minorities' and 'African Americans' for crime problems . ‘I think that if people just stayed on their own side of town in their own neighborhood that things like that wouldn't happen,’ Shanahan told WIVB. The occupant of the burned home was a minority and a refugee who’d fled persecution in his home country. ‘Every race and color has their own section of Buffalo,’ Shanahan continued, smiling into the news camera. ‘So if they just stay in their own neighborhood, things like this wouldn't happen.’ Outrage over Shanahan’s comments immediately spread throughout Buffalo and western New York and sparked a dialog about race-relations in the region. Shanahan even claimed he received death threats after his comments aired. But at least one statement Shanahan made has undoubtedly come true. ‘Property value goes down,’ Shanahan griped. ‘Crime goes up.’ And he was right. Crime, it seems, very well may have gone up. Old hat: Lt. Det. David Dudiziak says he's had over 50 run-ins with Shanahan and believes he robbed the bank for drug money . No shame: Shanahan robbed this bank, right around the neighborhood he told a TV crew was endangered by minority criminal elements . Shanahan was picked up in the very neighborhood he once claimed was imperilled by an influx of minorities after allegedly robbing a bank in nearby West Seneca, New York on February 13. Charges against the Shanahan include burglary, attempted robbery, and petit larceny. Ironically, they aren’t nearly the first crimes he’s been charged with in his neck of the woods. Lt. Detective David Dudiziak of the West Seneca Police said he and his department have had many run-ins with Shanahan. ‘We’ve had,’ the detective told WIVB, ‘in excess of fifty contacts with him over the years.’ Detective Dudiziak believes Shanahan robbed the bank for drug money.

But for Kirsty Elliott, it was clouded with worry. Diagnosed with cervical cancer when she was six months pregnant, the day marked the start of her long battle with the disease. 'I started five weeks of radiotherapy on . the same day my son Lucas came out of hospital,' the mother-of-two told MailOnline. 'So although it was great to have him home, I was terrified at the same time.' Kirsty with Darren and baby Lucas at Christmas: The family hope an MRI scan in March will reveal Kirsty has beaten cervical cancer . Ms Elliott and her fiance Darren Waters, 27, had discovered she was pregnant over Christmas in 2011. Although she had a four-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, this would be their first child together. 'We were thrilled as we hadn't been trying for long,' she said. 'I was quite under the weather for the first few months but I put it down to being pregnant.' Staying strong: Kirsty when she was 30 weeks pregnant and knew she had cervical cancer. She had to wait until she was 32 weeks before she could have Lucas via C section . But at 24 weeks, things started to go horribly wrong. 'I was just getting ready to go to my daughter Macey's ballet show,' said Ms Elliott, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, in South Wales. 'I was putting on my make up when I felt a trickle down my leg and I realised I was bleeding. Then I felt contractions starting. 'I was panicking so much but luckily Darren was there and he rushed me straight our local hospital.' Ms Eliott was seen at the Royal Glamorgan hospital in South Wales before she was transferred to the Llandough Hospital in Cardiff. Thankfully, her contractions eased and after a few days of being monitored she was allowed home. Doctors suspected she had a water infection that had threatened to bring on early labour. But a few days later she started bleeding again and this time doctors spotted lesions on her cervix. 'I had had a borderline smear test a month before I got pregnant,' she said. 'Now they did another smear test and it came back severely abnormal. They told us it was probably cervical cancer but to know more they would need to do a biopsy to confirm it.' She was 28 weeks pregnant when she received the news she had been dreading. 'I was in shock. I couldn't believe I had cancer,' she said. 'I was pregnant and I was only 25 at the time. I felt like it was happening to somebody else.' Her . doctors advised her to have a Caesarean at 32 weeks, to give her baby . and herself their best chances of survival. An agonising four weeks of . waiting followed. 'I had . such mixed emotions during that time. I was trying to get excited about . my new baby and was busy getting the room prepared as well as being as . normal as possible for my daughter Macey. 'Yet all the time I knew my cancer could be spreading.' Doctors planned to perform a C Section followed straight afterwards by a hysterectomy where they would . attempt to remove any traces of cancer. 'I remember I saw Lucas for a second before he was rushed to the neonatal unit, but that's all,' she said. 'When I finally came around I was so relieved because I thought the cancer had gone. 'But the doctors then told me they hadn't performed the hysterectomy as they suspected it had spread to the lymph nodes.' Kirsty at 30 weeks pregnant with Darren and Macey (left). She had Lucas (right) at 32 weeks but found out the cervical cancer had spread to her lymph nodes . Bouncing baby boy: Lucas was born eight weeks premature but has caught up with his peers . Lucas was allowed home after a week . in the neonatal unit, which was on the same day that Kirsty started five . weeks of radiotherapy. She had expressed milk before starting treatment but now struggled to bond with Lucas. 'I wasn't able to hold him for five days and I . couldn't breastfeed so I didn't feel like he was mine at first,' she said. 'It . was really hard as some days I barely had the energy to get out of bed. My four-year-old daughter was at home for the summer holidays and I . couldn't take her out places. 'Plus Darren, who plays rugby for the Newport Gwent Dragons, was at home with a knee injury.' Ms . Elliott also had chemotherapy once a week. Her treatment triggered an . early menopause, which means she won't be able to have any further . children. 'It was a very lonely time,' she said. 'Nobody . understood how I felt - some days I just didn't want to be positive like . my relatives. As a result, she turned to the support offered by Macmillan nurses. 'I could ring the nurses and they understood.' Kirsty was first able to hold Lucas when he was five days old (l). He is now seven-months old . Kirsty and Darren, who are getting married in December, with Macey and Lucas. In December, an MRI revealed cancer her gone from her lymph nodes, although it was visible on her cervix. 'My . body has responded to the treatment but I had hoped to be given the . all-clear so we could have a clean slate for 2013. But the doctors are . hoping the tumour will have gone from my cervix by March,' she said. 'I . still have my down days and think ""Why us?""

Jailed: Jennifer Davies was sentenced to 15 months in jail at Exeter Crown Court after pleasing guilty to stealing more than £20,000 from the Santander branch where she worked in Torquay . A bank cashier stole from more than £20,000 from customers to pay off her brother's gambling debts, purchase a car and fund a lavish holiday. Jennifer Davies, 25, took the money from  customer deposits at the Santander branch in Torquay where she worked as cashier. But investigators became suspicious when they noticed amounts similar to those going missing were turning up in Davies' own bank account with the bank. Davies was sentenced to 15-months in jail at Exeter Crown Court today after pleading guilty to 13 incidents of theft. The court heard how Davies, who was described as 'on the . lowest tier of staff', had responsibility for reconciling money lodged in the branch's ATM deposit box. She began to siphon off money contained in some of the customers’ deposit envelopes, with the sum eventually totalling  £20,150. Her spending included £4,000 towards her brother's gambling debts; £7,495 on a Mini; £549 on a bed and £2114 on a holiday, of which she had paid out £882. A search of her property also revealed nearly £1,000 in notes and bags of coins. Sentencing a tearful Davies to jail . today, recorder David Bartlett said: 'This was a case of simply using . the money for your own benefit. It is not as if you had seriously sick . relatives. 'You made use of the money which you found easy to steal for your own purposes. Unsophisticated: Davies' theft, totalling £20,150 over 18 months at a Santander branch in Torquay, was described as 'fairly unsophisticated' 'I . am afraid my view is that people in your position who abuse the trust . of their employers for a period in excess of a year and run up a loss to . them of more than £20,000 simply have to go to prison and go to prison . immediately.' James Taghdissian, prosecuting, said Davies had been employed with the bank for five years, more recently working as a cashier at the Fleet Street branch in Torquay. He said Davies 'just pocketed' some of the customers' lodgements she was meant to reconcile with the company's accounts. Mr Taghdissian said: 'She (told police) she paid money into her account from renting out her property. People were repaying loans. It didn’t make very much sense.' Theft: Recorder David Bartlett told Exeter Crown Court (pictured) that the theft 'was a case of simply using the money for your own benefit'. He added: 'It is not as if you had seriously sick relatives' But she later confessed to police during, saying she initially started to steal cash to help pay off her brother’s £4,000 gambling debt, the court was told. Defending, David Charles said his client, who pleaded guilty at the earliest possible stage, had admitted she had 'ruined her life'. 'You could suggest she has been extremely naive,' he said, adding that Davies had been diagnosed with depression last year. The recorder told Davies he had been 'most merciful' in passing the sentence, but added: 'I’m sorry to have to do this, but you must realise you must be punished for a sustained abuse of trust.'","Jennifer Davies, 25, sentenced to 15 months jail for stealing from lodgements .

Criticism: Britain's top civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood was lambasted last night by MPs for his bungled probe into the 'Plebgate' row which cost former minister Andrew Mitchell his job . Britain’s top civil servant was lambasted last night by MPs for his bungled probe into the ‘Plebgate’ row which cost former minister Andrew Mitchell his job. A damning report by an influential Commons committee  castigated Cabinet Secretary  Sir Jeremy Heywood for failing to conduct a proper investigation into discrepancies between the police version of events and CCTV footage. Downing Street today defended the top mandarin, insisting David Cameron stood by the much-criticised report. The former Chief Whip was forced to resign over allegations that he called a policeman a ‘f***ing pleb’ after he refused to let him cycle through the gates of Downing Street. Mr Mitchell says he was the victim of a conspiracy. The Commons public administration committee’s report concludes that Sir Jeremy, who earns £190,000 a year, is not an ‘appropriate’ person to conduct inquiries into accusations of ministerial misconduct. The report is a humiliation for the man who is so powerful that he is known as Mr Cameron’s ‘right-hand mandarin’. In their investigation on Plebgate, the MPs found that Sir Jeremy: . One senior parliamentary source said: ‘If the Cabinet Secretary had done his job properly, it is highly unlikely Mitchell would have had to resign. The police claims would have crumbled.’ Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the committee, said Sir Jeremy’s investigation ‘clearly failed to uncover the truth’. He added: ‘The Cabinet Secretary attempted to investigate this matter but failed to resolve or even to investigate the questions arising from the discrepancies in the accounts of the events, or to advise the Prime Minister that they required further investigation.’ Heywood faces humiliation over his inept handling of the 'Plebgate' inquiry, which cost Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell his job . Sir Jeremy told the committee two weeks ago that he had suspicions that Mr Mitchell might have been the victim of a ‘gigantic conspiracy’ by the police. Despite this, the report found that he failed to conduct a proper inquiry. It said: ‘Sir Jeremy should have advised the Prime Minister that these questions required further investigation and therefore a wider inquiry.’ Today Mr Cameron's official spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'As regards the review that the Cabinet Secretary undertook, the Prime Minister remains absolutely of the view that it was the right review at the right time. 'He fully supported the conclusion it reached - that the additional information received (in two emails) could not be considered reliable - and so the Prime Minister's initial conclusion was unchanged.' By Andrew Pierce . One of the first calls David Cameron . makes when he starts work in the Downing Street flat at 5.45am is to . Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood. He is one of the last people he . speaks to at night. No . civil servant in modern times has enjoyed such unrivalled power as . Heywood, who has served three chancellors and three prime ministers. Today, . however, he faces humiliation after an excoriating report by the . Commons public administration committee into his inept handling of the . ‘Plebgate’ inquiry, which cost Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell his job. Despite his blunders, no major decision is made without the PM consulting the Harry Potter lookalike Cabinet Secretary: The PM walks with Heywood (right) and Sir Gus ODonnell Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Home Civil Service (middle) If . a minister was subjected to such damning criticism he would be unlikely . to survive the ensuing firestorm. For now, Heywood continues to enjoy . the full confidence of the Prime Minister. Yet the committee’s criticism . that Heywood was not rigorous enough is all too familiar. Last . summer, Sir Richard Branson feared the bidding process for the . multi-billion-pound West Coast rail franchise was going against his . company, which ran the line. The Virgin train boss was sure the . Department for Transport’s figures were wrong. In a series of letters he . warned the PM, but to no avail. Who did the PM pass the correspondence . to? Sir Jeremy Heywood, of course. The . Cabinet Secretary sought assurances from the Department for Transport, . and reported back to Mr Cameron that nothing was amiss. Only later did . it emerge that the mistakes officials made in calculating the bids – . which led to the decision to award the franchise to Virgin’s rival . FirstGroup being scrapped – will cost the taxpayer tens of millions of . pounds. Heywood was the driving force last year behind the move to hand control of BAE, one of Britain's last major manufacturers, to a European consortium, a move which, surprisingly Cameron backed . One ministerial source said: ‘Heywood never asked the right questions.’ The same criticism is made of him today over ‘Plebgate’. Despite . his blunders, no major decision is made without the PM consulting the . Harry Potter lookalike Cabinet Secretary. Heywood, the PM’s chief . adviser and confessor, attends the daily strategy meeting – a select . group that includes Chancellor George Osborne and chief of staff Ed . Llewellyn. He . sits next to Cameron at Cabinet meetings. He keeps the minutes, but his . power extends far beyond taking notes. He has a desk outside the PM’s . study so he can see who goes in and out. Heywood has exploited his place in the privileged inner circle to stray deep into areas of policy . So who is this Teflon-coated Sir Humphrey? Heywood, . 51, attended the private Bootham School in York, which was run by the . Quakers. His family were not Quakers, but his father taught English at . the school. He won a scholarship to Oxford, studying history and . economics, and joined the civil service after gaining a Masters in . economics at the LSE. It . was at the Treasury in the early 1990s that he met a youthful adviser . to Norman Lamont named David Cameron. They have been close ever since. At the Treasury, he also met his wife Suzanne, a high-flyer at . management consultants McKinsey. They have three children. Heywood, . who is paid £190,000 and took a bonus last year despite calls for . public sector pay restraint, lives in a £2million house in Clapham, . South London, where he had a walk-in wine cellar built in the basement. And . he is not averse to letting his hair down a little. Before Christmas, . he threw a party for senior civil servants at home. As the wine flowed, . Heywood challenged Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the Civil Service, to a . game of pool on a miniature table owned by one of his children. Heywood . was victorious. But then this is a man who has long been used to being on the winning side, in politics as in life. He . was hand-picked by Tony Blair to be his Private Secretary and stayed at . the Cabinet Office under Gordon Brown. After serving two Labour prime . ministers, it was assumed that Heywood would go when David Cameron . arrived in Downing Street. But Cameron, delighted at being reunited with . his former colleague, knighted him and promoted him to Cabinet . Secretary. Today, he’s . the only civil servant in the ‘Chumocracy’ – the small group of public . school-educated men and women who are utterly loyal to Mr Cameron, and . are cheerleaders for the modernisation of the Tory Party. West Coast rail bid: Virgin's Richhard Branson was sure the Department for Transport's figures were wrong, but Heywood reported to the PM that they were correct- an error that will cost the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds . Unlike his predecessors, . Heywood has exploited his place in the privileged inner circle to stray . deep into areas of policy. He has even banished all Tories from the . No 10 policy unit, which is now run by civil servants. Is it any wonder . the Government is bereft of any policies to excite the Tory faithful? Heywood . was the driving force last year behind the move to hand control of BAE, . one of Britain’s last major manufacturers, to a European consortium. To . the astonishment of many Tories, the Prime Minister was supportive of . the deal, which eventually collapsed. One . minister said tartly: ‘It was bad for Great Britain PLC, and Heywood . should have been nowhere near it.’ Not least because there was what many . regarded as a conflict of interest. The bank advising on the deal, and . earning millions in fees, was Morgan Stanley, where Heywood had been a . senior director for five years until 2008, having left Downing Street to . gain private sector experience. He . was also head of the Morgan Stanley team which advised on the sale of . the care home chain Southern Cross in 2006 to a US private equity firm. The deal unravelled and 3,000 jobs were lost. Heywood’s . tentacles have even stretched to welfare, one of the few areas where . the Government is making progress. It was leaked in the autumn that . Heywood opposed some of Welfare Secretary Iain Duncan Smith’s flagship . changes. The Welfare Secretary’s supporters are furious. ‘It’s a key . area of our work and an unelected civil servant is trying to scupper . it,’ said a friend of IDS. ‘Cameron should rein him in.’ But . he won’t, because Heywood has learned how to reinforce the PM’s natural . instincts. Indeed, so potent is the hold that the Manchester . United-supporting mandarin has on Cameron that ministers are careful to . whisper their criticisms. As . one said: ‘Cameron trusts Heywood far more than his ministers.’ That . relationship will be tested by the committee’s findings today.","Discrepancies between police version of events and CCTV footage was not investigated .

With Argo receiving gongs galore this awards season, Ben Affleck has made his mark on the film industry. And now the director and star of Argo has made his mark on the fashion world too, thanks to his fondness for a bag his CIA agent character Tony Mendez uses in the movie. The bag, a £225 canvas holdall made by small Lake District firm The Sporting Lodge, appears in scenes being carried around Tehran by Mendez as he tries to rescue a group of diplomats. And Affleck is said to have liked the bag so much that he took the two used in filming home with him. Famous bag: Ben Affleck fell in love with it in Argo (R), and now the Westmorland Bag is putting a Lake District firm in the limelight. Lindsay MacFarlaine, director of the Sporting Lodge in Storth (L) shows off her work . The Westmorland bag was created . especially for the film's costume department by the Storth-based firm . after they received a request for a shoulder bag to be used by Affleck's . character. Sporting Lodge director Lindsay MacFarlaine, whose father George founded the business in 1952, said 'Hollywood had called' 18 months ago. 'We were asked to make a bag which could be used in screen tests, and had just two weeks to turn it around and send it out there,' she said. 'The brief was to create something really hardwearing for a CIA agent, and we wanted to introduce a bit of colour. Designer: The Sporting Lodge was asked to design a shoulder bag to be used by Ben's character in the film Argo but had no idea of its future success . 'It was made by hand from triple-layered waterproof canvas, with a bridle leather trim. 'Until six months ago we had no idea they had decided to go with it and that it had been used quite extensively in the film.' After they designed the limited edition bag, named The Westmorland, it was manufactured by the firm's long-time collaborator, bag-maker Brady. Just 13 copies were made, with Sporting Lodge keeping two, and two being used in the film. The rest have sold out - no doubt thanks to Affleck's association. Mrs MacFarlaine said: 'We called it The Westmorland because we thought why not promote this part of the world?' Stylish: The shoulder bag is made by hand from triple layered waterproof canvas in Olive Green, with Tan bridle leather trim . 'It is particularly pleasing that Hollywood has turned to the finest English manufacturing to feature in such a well-thought of film.

Adidas has launched a new running shoe with new technology they say will revolutionise running. The sportswear giant say the £110 Boost, which has added bounce built into its soles, is their most advanced to date. The footwear contains a new material - dubbed 'energy capsules' that are melted and built into the sole. The bouncy material returns more energy to the runner - meaning the wearer can run more efficiently on the roads and go for longer without expending as much energy. Scroll down for video .

Saturn's moon Titan is home to lakes of massive hydrocarbon 'icebergs' that could form exotic forms of life, scientists have claimed.

'One of the most intriguing questions . about these lakes and seas is whether they might host an exotic form of . life,' said Jonathan Lunine of Cornell University, who co-authored the . study. An artist's impression of the hydrocarbon 'icebergs' on Titan scientists believe could harbour an exotic form of life . Titan is the only other body besides Earth in our solar system with stable bodies of liquid on its surface. However, while our planet's cycle of . precipitation and evaporation involves water, Titan's cycle involves . hydrocarbons like ethane and methane. Ethane and methane are organic . molecules, which scientists think can be building blocks for the more . complex chemistry from which life arose. Cassini has seen a vast network of . these hydrocarbon seas cover Titan's northern hemisphere, while a more . sporadic set of lakes bejewels the southern hemisphere. Cassini scientists assumed that Titan . lakes would not have floating ice, because solid methane is denser than . liquid methane and would sink. Titan in front of Saturn: researchers now believe the moon could hold 'exotic life' in its lakes and rivers . But the new model, revealed today, . considers the interaction between the lakes and the atmosphere, . resulting in different mixtures of compositions, pockets of nitrogen . gas, and changes in temperature. The result, scientists found, is that . winter ice will float in Titan's methane-and-ethane-rich lakes and seas . if the temperature is below the freezing point of methane -- minus 297 . degrees Fahrenheit (90.4 Kelvins). 'We now know it's possible to get . methane-and-ethane-rich ice freezing over on Titan in thin blocks that . congeal together as it gets colder -- similar to what we see with Arctic . sea ice at the onset of winter,' said Jason Hofgartner, first author on . the paper and a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of .

The founder of Tesla Motors has said the batteries used by Boeing in its Dreamliner aircraft are 'inherently unsafe' - after it emerged that an airline replaced the batteries ten times before all 787s were grounded. Boeing was placed under increasing pressure today after it emerged the plane manufacturer knew of previous problems with the batteries. All Nippon Airways (ANA) said it . had to replace the batteries on its 787 aircraft ten times because they failed . to charge properly or showed other problems. Concerns: All Nippon Airways (ANA) said today it had replaced batteries on its 787 aircraft 10 times because they failed to charge properly or showed other problems, and informed Boeing about the swaps . Damaged: The singed battery case from the Japan Airlines (JAL) Boeing 787 Dreamliner is displayed inside an investigation lab at the NTSB Headquarters in Washington, DC . Investigation: The state-of-the-art Dreamliners continues to be grounded as the investigation into the cause of the thermal damage continues . And Japan Airlines also said it had replaced batteries on the 787 'on a few occasions'. ANA said it had informed Boeing about . the swaps. However, it said it was not required to report the battery . problems to safety regulators because they were not considered a safety . issue and none of its flights were delayed or cancelled. The incidents . occurred between May and December last year. Adding to the pressure on Boeing, U.S. innovator and entrepreneur . Elon Musk, who is the founder of Tesla car company, told British . aerospace journal Flight International about the batteries: 'Unfortunately, the pack architecture supplied to . Boeing is inherently unsafe.' All 50 of the Boeing 787s in use around . the world were grounded following two incidents with the batteries earlier this month. First, there was also a battery fire in a 787 parked at Boston's Logan International Airport on January 7. Then on January 16, an ANA flight was forced to make an . emergency landing in Japan when its main battery overheated. Burnt: The NTSB's Joseph Kolly, holds part of the badly fire-damaged battery casing. The battery has been taken apart by experts in a bid to work out what went wrong . According to the New York Times, ANA . said in five of the ten replacement batteries the main battery had . showed a low charge. In three cases, the airline said the main battery . failed to operate normally. Japan Airlines spokesman Sze Hunn Yap declined to be more specific on when . units were replaced or whether these were reported to authorities. Following the revelations about the previous problems with the batteries, Boeing was today ordered to provide a  full operating history of the batteries used in its 787 Dreamliners. The National Transportation Safety Board in the U.S. made the request after becoming aware of the previous incidents. Lithium-ion batteries are prone to overheating and require additional safeguards to prevent fires. Laura . Brown, a spokeswoman for the US Federal Aviation Administration, said . in Washington that the agency was checking whether the previous battery . incidents had been reported by Boeing. With 17 of the jets, ANA was Boeing's . launch customer for the technologically advanced airliner. The airline . has had to cancel hundreds of flights, affecting tens of thousands of . people, but has sought to minimise disruptions by switching to other . aircraft as much as possible. Probe: NTSB investigators and metallurgists examine parts of the disassembled battery which have been laid out on a table . Detailed: A member of the NTSB investigation team examines pieces of damaged electrode coils from the battery . The battery problems experienced by ANA before the emergency landing were first reported by The New York Times. Japanese . and U.S. investigators looking into the Boeing 787's battery problems . shifted their attention this week from the battery-maker, GS Yuasa of . Kyoto, Japan, to the manufacturer of a monitoring system. That company, . Kanto Aircraft Instrument Co, makes a system that monitors voltage, . charging and temperature of the lithium-ion batteries. Yesterday . the U.S National Transportation Safety Board said it was conducting a . chemical analysis of internal short circuiting and thermal damage of the . battery that caught fire in Boston. The probe was also analysing data from flight data recorders on the aircraft, the NTSB said on its website. Incident: A 787 made a landing in Takamatsu after a burning smell was also detected in its cockpit. Both All Nippon Airlines and Japan Airlines have grounded their entire Dreamliner fleets . Hopes: Visitors admired the first production model of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner when it was unveiled to an audience of several thousand at Boeing's assembly plant in Everett, Washington . Complex: Parts for the flagship craft are constructed by firms around the world . Last week Experts from the US National . Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) began disassembled the burnt out battery from the Dreamliner which caught fire in a bid . to discover the cause of the malfunction - but admitted they . are no closer to reaching a conclusion. They believe it could hold the key to the technical problem which grounded the entire multi-billion dollar fleet. The NTSB said its investigation into the incident on January 7 is still in its 'early stages.' Deborah Hersman, head of the NTSB, . described the incident in Boston as a 'very serious air safety concern', . and that the body does 'not expect to see fire events onboard . aircraft,' according to the Telegraph. Meanwhile, batteries expert George Blomgren, who worked for Eveready for 40 years told CBS news that from what he knows about the incidents on board the Boeing 787s he would 'not fly in a Dreamliner tomorrow.' 'I just wouldn't feel that it was appropriate or safe,' he said. The NTSB said that despite . establishing that the lithium-ion device suffered a short circuit it . still has to 'figure out why these events occurred.'The revelation is more bad news for Boeing as it means the worldwide fleet of Dreamliners remains grounded.

Two of Britain’s supermarket giants have locked horns after Tesco reported a surge in sales but Sainsbury’s disputed the figures. Tesco, the UK’s biggest retailer, said takings for the six weeks around Christmas were up by 1.8 per cent on the year before. However, Sainsbury’s claimed the rise, the biggest for three years, was an exaggeration. Improvement: Tesco recorded its best Christmas figures for three years, with like-for-like sales up 1.8 per cent . The attack – evidence of an increasingly bitter battle between the two – was swiftly dismissed by Tesco as a ‘smear’. Sainsbury’s pointed out that Tesco’s . figure included sales made through vouchers given to shoppers under its . Clubcard loyalty scheme. An email from Sainsbury’s said the 1.8 per cent . figure was ‘disingenuous’. But even without the voucher sales, at . 1.4 per cent Tesco’s rise was ahead of the 0.9 per cent at Sainsbury’s . for the same period. Significant investment: Tesco has taken on an extra 8,000 staff and launched its Everyday Value range . Shoppers buying food and drink online for Christmas gave Tesco a particular boost, with website sales up by 18 per cent. 'More to do': Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke is trying to reverse the fall in profits recorded by the chain last year . More than half a million food orders were fulfilled in the week before Christmas. The sales surge follows a £1billion . action plan by Tesco  to refurbish stores, employ 8,000 more customer . service staff and launch new ranges. These included Everyday Value . budget products, which along with upmarket Finest outperformed other . ranges. The latest figures are a stark . contrast with a year ago, when Tesco revealed a Christmas sales slump of . 2.3 per cent and its shares lost almost £5billion in a day. While Sainsbury’s executives launched a . series of briefings to accuse Tesco of massaging the figures, the boost . surprised the City, bringing a 3 per cent rise in the share price . yesterday. John Ibbotson, of consultants Retail . Vision, said: ‘After a listless 2012, the empire strikes back. 'With . like-for-like sales growth jumping to its highest level for three years, . Tesco has come out fighting. 'The £1billion invested in revamping stores . and boosting customer service is finally delivering a handsome return.’ Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke . said: ‘I am pleased with our performance over the important Christmas . and New Year period in the UK.’ But he added: ‘Whilst our seasonal performance is encouraging, there is a lot more to do.’ Some analysts were cautious, . suggesting it would take further improvements to demonstrate the . company, which takes £30 of every £100 spent in supermarkets, has seen a . permanent return to growth.

The fast-food giant is hoping to win over locals by rebranding a number of stores in the country with its widely-used Aussie nickname. The move is part of a campaign to mark Australia Day, the country's official national holiday, which falls on January 26. Rebrand: Fast-food giant McDonald's is changing the name of 13 branches in Australia to Macca's, a nickname widely used by Australians . The new name will adorn 13 branches in the country, including restaurants in the southern Sydney suburb of Engadine and an outlet in Queensland's Kangaroo Point. But the move, described as a first for the international company, is only a temporary measure, with signage to return to normal at the beginning of February. 'We're incredibly proud to embrace our . ‘Australian-only' nickname,' said Mark Lollback, the company's chief . marketing officer in Australia.

The company was persuaded to carry out the name change after market research revealed that at least 50 per cent of Australians use the nickname. A national survey placed the term as the second most recognised 'Australianism', behind 'footy' for Australian . Rules football.

From espressos and mochas to the last few eggnog lattes being sold at the coffee chain's 18,000 stores worldwide, Beautiful Existence (her legal name) is planning to eat and drink at Starbucks alone for the whole of 2013. 'We're really lucky and I would say actually spoiled as Americans because we have all these different eating options,' she told MyNorthWest.com. Extra shot? Beautiful Existence, pictured, a mother of two from Seattle has pledged to only eat Starbucks products for the rest of the year . 'You go to all these other countries and they don't have these luxuries. Really? Is it really going to be that hard for one year of my life to . limit my menu? We'll find out.' Writing on her blog she says she is inspired by the likes of Morgan Spurlock and Jared - the Subway guy - but is frustrated women aren't taking on such food challenges. 'Life is curious… Life is unique… Life is about asking questions, no matter how small, silly or profound so that you can find out what is TRUE for YOU and sometimes see if its true for others as well,' she writes. 'So how can eating only one company’s products impact me, anybody? Well Mr. McDonald’s already proved that question years ago with his documentary and Mr. Subway did his take on the loosing [sic] weight portion of the food challenges too. But when I watched those guys doing their thing I asked myself 'where are the WOMEN challenging themselves in the world?''. Starbucks need not worry. Ms Existence is a big fan of the chain and says she wants to promote the store. 'I wanted to help show others what I already knew from family and friend . partners (Starbucks code for staff) about all the environmental and . job-creation/job-benefits and community building this local company does,' she writes. Coffee-lover: Beautiful Existence, pictured left, is going to only consume Starbucks products for the rest of the year. She is a big fan of the chain and says she wants to promote the good work it does in Seattle . It isn't the first time she has taken on a year-long endeavor. In 2011 she blogged about only buying her belongings in Goodwill stores. One thing making her challenge slightly less burdensome this time around is she's allowing herself Tazo tea and Evolution Fresh products too - given they are owned by Starbucks. Day 1: Fresh orange juice, Starbucks Refresher drink, turkey and swiss sandwich, ham and swiss panini . Day 2: Simply nuts and fruit, Evolution Fresh - Kevin's quinoa, kale and squash bowl . Day 3: Southwest scramble and Crystal's black beans and greens, turkey rustico pannini . Day 4: Turkey rustico panini, roasted tomato and mozzarella panini, latte, banana, garden veggies bistro box, Starbucks caramel macchiato ice cream . Day 5: Hard boiled eggs, Ancho chilli chicken wrap, Tazo tea - ginger infused sugar . And Starbucks products are now sold in so many supermarkets she isn't confined to official coffee houses alone. She says she is using information on packaging to ensure she gets the nutrition she needs and won't put on weight because of the challenge. 'I’ve been going in and getting their nutrition by the cup charts for all their serving sizes', she told the local news website. 'I’m already getting a feel for what . to eat — the plain nut pack as a snack because it only has 190 calories, . compared to the piece of pumpkin bread. 'I'm still trying to figure out how I can do sushi. I have . two friends who are chefs and I want to see if I can get them to help me . tear down some of the products at Evolution fresh and do something . else.' Aside from the obvious limitations of eating only in a coffee shop the project is also quite expensive. Despite . donations of Starbucks goods from fans of the blog, Ms Existence is . averaging $18.79 a day, but even that isn't putting her off. Chain reaction: Starbucks has been the object of many bloggers interest. Seattle mother Beautiful Existence is a big fan so won't be causing any headaches with her challenge to just eat there in 2013 . 'The company pays good benefits for part-time workers,' she explains. 'That’s where my money is going.' And so far she has only fallen off the wagon once - when baking cakes for her two sons. 'I will admit to you all right now that I did indeed lick the batter-covered spoon, initially it happened out of bad habit… but it happened,' she wrote on the blog. 'I guess you can say that this was my first “Oops” moment of this year of eating/drinking only  Starbucks.'

Speaking out: Sir Mervyn King yesterday accused the Government of scoring an embarrassing 'own goal' by pushing up inflation through green taxes and tuition fees . Sir Mervyn King yesterday accused the Government of scoring an embarrassing ‘own goal’ by pushing up inflation through green taxes and tuition fees. The Governor of the Bank of England warned that the unprecedented squeeze on living standards will last for a further three years as prices rise and wages stagnate. But, in a coded attack on ministers, he said much of the pain was ‘self-inflicted’ because it stemmed from big increases in energy bills and tuition fees. ‘Whether it’s on financing education, green policies or other policies, what they have done is push up prices and that clearly makes our job in the short-run more difficult,’ Sir Mervyn said. The average household energy bill is now more than £1,300 a year and has risen nearly 25 per cent since early 2011, with suppliers blaming green levies imposed by the Government. Rail fares, which are regulated by the Government, have also soared and university tuition fees are now as much as £9,000 a year. Speaking at the Bank’s quarterly inflation report yesterday, Sir Mervyn said there was ‘cause for optimism in the UK’ but added that economic growth is ‘likely to be weak’ in the coming months. He also said the level of economic output is not expected to return to its pre-recession peak in 2008 until 2015 – marking a seven-year downturn. And with inflation expected to remain above 2 per cent until early 2016 there could be three more years of squeezed living standards. Even in 2016, there is a ‘50-50 chance’ inflation would stay above target. Senior figures in Westminster expressed amazement that the Governor had spoken out so vociferously against Government policies. Former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott said: ‘The Governor is basically blaming the Chancellor for pushing up prices.’ Not happy: The governor of the Bank of England believes inflation has been pushed up by the introduction of tuition fees. This is a file picture of graduates . Bank critics, however, accused Sir . Mervyn and the Monetary Policy Committee of ‘an abdication of . responsibility’ for allowing inflation to spiral above the 2 per cent . target for so long. It was last below target in November 2009. David . Ruffley, a Tory member of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘This is . a quite extraordinary intervention. It is the Bank of England’s job, . when setting interest rates, to hit a 2 per cent inflation target, to . take account of precisely items like tuition fees and green taxes. It’s . fundamental to the MPC forecast.’ Sir Mervyn’s dramatic intervention came just months before he hands over the reins to Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, in July. ‘The UK economy is set for a recovery,’ said Sir Mervyn. Surprised: David Ruffley, a Tory member of the Treasury Select Committee, said Sir Mervyn's comments were a 'quite extraordinary intervention' ‘That is not to say the road ahead will be smooth. This hasn’t been a normal recession and it won’t be a normal recovery.’ The report forecast inflation to rise from its current level of 2.7 per cent to above 3 per cent in the coming months, eating into household budgets. Sir Mervyn said tuition fees, rail fares and utility bills added around one percentage point to inflation at the end of last year and will do so throughout 2013 and 2014. ‘It’s a bit of an own goal because it looks as if inflation is worse without any change in the underlying economy,’ he said. ‘It is a bit of a self-inflicted goal in terms of the damage done to real take-home pay.’ The inflation report warned that the higher cost of education would add 0.3 percentage points to inflation in 2013 and again in 2014. Electricity and gas bills are expected to add 0.3 percentage points while other ‘regulated and administrative’ prices, including rail fares, water, and taxes on air travel, alcohol, tobacco and fuel, would add 0.4 percentage points. The Governor said the increase in these prices made ‘the challenge of bringing inflation back to 2 per cent more difficult’. But he warned that raising interest rates to curb rising prices ‘would risk derailing the recovery’. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Government has taken continued action to help with the cost of living, by freezing fuel duty for more than two years and also taking action to freeze council tax.’","Sir Mervyn said squeeze on living standards will last for another three years .

Released: Ronnie Barker's son Adam Barker could receive £1.4million after being freed from jail after 13 weeks behind bars . The paedophile son of actor Ronnie Barker has been freed just 13 weeks after being jailed and is expected to receive an inheritance of more than £1.4million. Adam Barker, 44, was jailed in October for 12 months for child porn offences, but was released on January 22 after time on remand was deducted, The Sun reported today. He now stands to enjoy the cash he inherited from his parents while he was living alone in Hungary while on the run for eight years. He fled the UK in 2004 and missed the funerals of his Porridge, Open All Hours and The Two Ronnies star father, who died aged 76 in 2005, and his mother Joy, who died aged 78 last year. Isleworth Crown Court heard last year how the former bit-part actor had only 'relatively recently' found out about the deaths of his parents. Barker gave himself up at a police station in west London in July after returning to the UK as he had run out of funds. Ronnie Barker left an estate of £300,337 after he died of heart failure aged 76 in October 2005. His will left £275,000 to be split between his three children - giving Adam just over £91,000 - and the rest to his wife Joy. The bulk of his fortune did not feature in his estate as most jointly-held assets pass directly to a spouse. Mrs Barker who lived near Chipping Norton in the Cotswolds died in January last year, leaving a net estate of £6,520,426 which was split equally between her three children. Adam and his brother Larry, 52, and sister Charlotte, 49, inherited around £1,340,000 from their mother after inheritance tax and other expenses. Charlotte was made executor of her mother's will, responsible for distributing her estate. It is thought that the money due to her younger brother was left in an account waiting for him to claim it.

But he was forced to defend himself using a shop sign when two gunmen pounced as he locked up his shop in Handsworth, Birmingham, just before midnight on Monday. Shopkeeper Kochar Rasul fended off armed robbers with a sign. He said the streets around his inner city Birmingham store were 'more violent' than his native Iraq . He told how he grabbed the sign and used it as a shield to fend off the robbers who pistol-whipped him and held a gun to his head. The father-of-two said he was bending down to lock the front door of Nine Wines and Food Store when he was attacked. 'I looked up and two men were standing over me and one had a gun to my head,' said Mr Rasul. 'They started to hit me around the head with the gun but I managed to grab it off them and it fell to the floor.' Mr Rasul said one of the robbers ran over and picked up the gun and walked back to him. 'He was coming towards me and I thought, oh no, he's going to shoot me this time,' he said.

Luckily for the shopkeeper, an armed response police car was passing at the time and officers came to his aid. The robbers escaped with just Mr Rasul's carrier bag containing orange juice, a pizza and a packet of cigarettes. Police arrested a 26-year-old man at gunpoint in a nearby alleyway on suspicion of robbery. A suspected firearm was also seized.

'I thought it would be safe here, but it isn't, it's very dangerous with crime always going on and lots of bad people around,' he said. 'It's more dangerous here than Iraq because at least there, you knew who your enemies are.' Detective Constanble Phil Langstone, from Force CID in Harborne, praised Mr Rasul's courage. 'The victim was very brave in his attempt to fight off the attackers and the fact that armed officers just happened to be passing at that particular moment was a case of being in the right place at the right time,' he said.","Kochar Rasul, 30, was forced to defend himself using a shop sign .

Guilty: Lee Clark, outside Newcastle Crown Court, where he was found guilty of fatally shaking his five-month-old baby son to death . A father has been found guilty of shaking his baby son to death while the boy’s mother was buying Christening clothes. Lee Clark, 27, was today jailed for nine years for the manslaughter of his five-month-old son Charlee. A jury today found Clark guilty by a majority of 10 to two following a trial which lasted just over two weeks. He injured his son and caused brain damage while the baby’s mother Natalie Holmes was shopping, just two days before the baby was due to be baptised, a jury was told. Newcastle Crown Court heard Charlee was ‘smiling’ and ‘happy’ when Natalie left the family home for Darlington, County Durham, on February 25, 2011 at around 10.45am. But when she returned to Neville Close in Gainford, County Durham, later that afternoon, the baby was making a ‘funny groaning sound’, his ‘eyes were rolling backwards’ and he had bruises on each knee. Charlee was taken to Darlington Memorial Hospital where it was obvious he was ‘extremely ill’, the court was told. He was given oxygen and a brain scan, which showed that Charlee was suffering from bleeding round the brain, a swollen brain, bleeding at the back of his eyes and in his eyes, prosecutor Andrew Roberts told jurors. Attempts were made to treat Charlee in the intensive care unit but he died days later on March 1. His Christening had been due to take place on Sunday February 27. Concerning: Newcastle Crown Court heard when the child's mother returned to Neville Close in Gainford, County Durham, later that afternoon, the baby was making a 'funny groaning sound' At hospital, Clark had asked doctors if Charlee’s injuries could have been caused by ‘bouncing’ him on his knee. Dr Malik Alam, a consultant paediatrician at Darlington Memorial Hospital, informed the police and social services after tests revealed Charlee was suffering from serious bleeding to his brain. Guilty: A jury today found Clark guilty by a majority of 10 to two following a trial which lasted just over two weeks . He told the youngster’s parents of his opinion and Mr Clark responded by saying: 'I have not shaken the baby.' Mr Roberts said: “Charlie, happy and normal, was left in the sole care of this defendant. 'Something must have happened while he was alone with Charlee because all the evidence shows he gripped and shook him vigorously. 'The first indication that Miss Holmes had that something was not quite right was when she received a text from the defendant saying the baby was unsettled.' Clark’s mother had arrived at the family’s home at around 12.10pm that day so the defendant could meet Miss Holmes in Darlington. Mr Roberts added: 'By that stage Charlee was a very different baby than the one Miss Holmes had left. 'Charlee was in his swing whinging and grizzling. 'When the defendant’s mother tried to lift Charlee out of the swing, Charlee let out a scream.' Clark showed no emotion as the guilty verdict was delivered, as some family members in the public gallery broke down in tears. After the guilty verdict at Newcastle Crown Court, Charlee's mother Natalie Holmes said: 'Words cannot describe the devastation I feel at the loss of my beautiful baby son Charlee. Speaking out: After the guilty verdict at Newcastle Crown Court, Charlee's mother Natalie Holmes said: 'Words cannot describe the devastation I feel at the loss of my beautiful baby son Charlee' 'It's now almost two years since Charlee's death and I cannot say how much we as a family miss him and just how difficult it has been trying to come to terms with our tragic loss. Charlee was such a happy, relaxed gorgeous baby boy who was always smiling and we continue to think of him and miss him every day. 'Following today's verdict we as a family feel relieved that the truth is out and justice has been done for Charlee. 'We would now ask that we are left in peace to grieve our loss and begin to try and recover from this.'Detective Superintendent Adrian Green, from Durham Constabulary, said: 'This has been a complex two-year investigation into the death of Charlee Clarke, a happy and healthy baby, killed at the hands of his father. 'Throughout the course of the investigation Mr Clark has failed to assist the police and in doing so has brought further pain and anguish on his then partner Natalie. 'I hope the verdict has provided the answers the family sought and takes them some way further towards coping with the loss of Charlee.'","Lee Clark, 27, was accused of the manslaughter of his son Charlee .

But John Lewis, held up as the face of ‘responsible capitalism’ by ministers, is axing hundreds of senior roles at its 28 department stores. The popular retailer yesterday announced plans to wipe out 325 departmental manager posts – paying salaries of £35,000 to £45,000 – despite being one of the high street’s strongest performers. Safe haven: The popular retailer has announced it is to axe hundreds of senior posts at its 28 department stores, as more and more customers choose to shop online . The move has been triggered by customers turning online. The company’s Christmas online sales were up 44 per cent year-on-year and overall sales rose by 15 per cent to £684 million for the five weeks to December 29. In a statement John Lewis - famous for classing staff as partners and paying them bonuses - said: ‘As part of our plans for future growth, we are proposing to streamline management structures in some of our established shops. There will be opportunities for redeployment in new roles created as part of this process or in new shops due to open over the next 18 months.’ Just three months ago managing director Andy Street warned that John Lewis could be put out of business if foreign giants are not forced to pay more tax in the UK. He warned that firms such as Amazon, based in overseas tax havens, would ‘out-invest and ultimately out-trade’ businesses that are paying full taxes in the UK. Popular: The move comes in spite of the retailer's positive Christmas period, during which it saw overall sales increase by 15 per cent in the five weeks to December 29 . But he insisted yesterday that the job losses were not linked to that warning. He said: ‘What we are doing is anticipating how the retail market is changing and ensuring our shop model is competitive for the long term. 'Otherwise, we will end up in a position that some of our competitors are reflecting.’ In a dismal day for UK retailers, fashion chain Republic collapsed, putting 2,500  jobs in 121 stores at risk, while the  administrator of movie rental firm  Blockbuster cut 800 jobs.","Retailer is to axe hundreds of senior roles at its 28 department stores .

The successful search for the skeleton of Richard III has prompted calls for a fresh bid to locate the remains of another major historical figure buried in Leicester. Cardinal Thomas Wolsey is known to have been buried at the city's abbey in 1530, but his bones have remained undiscovered. The churchman, Henry VIII's Lord Chancellor, died at the abbey while travelling to London after being accused of treason when he failed to secure the annulment of the king's marriage to his first wife Catherine of Aragon. Hunt: The bones of Henry VIII's Lord Chancellor Cardinal Thomas Wolsey remain undiscovered . At the time of his death Wolsey was arguably England's second most powerful person after the king. The ruined abbey can be seen in Abbey Park close to the city centre. Confirmation last week that a skeleton found under a council car park in Leicester in September, last year made the city the focus of media attention worldwide. The remains of Richard III were found under a council car park in Leicester in September last year . A stunning find: The remains of King Richard III (pictured) were found in a . hastily dug grave beneath a council car park in Leicester last . September, in what were once the precincts of Grey Friars church . The Battle of Bosworth: Richard, pictured on the . white horse, was killed in battle more than 500 years ago at Bosworth . field, in a battle which marked the end of his line and the rise of the . Tudors. Wolsey served as royal chaplain to Henry VII, who seized the throne . Thomas Wolsey (1473-1530) was arguably the most powerful figure during the first half of Henry VIII's reign. He came from a relatively humble background and rose to become royal chaplain under Henry VII in 1507. Two years later, the king died and was replaced by his son Henry VIII, who took a hands-off approach to governing which allowed the likes of Wolsey to build up unprecedented power. After sidelining most of his rivals, Wolsey was appointed Archbishop of York in 1514 and Lord Chancellor the next year, propelling him almost to the very top of the hierarchy in both the secular and religious spheres. He was also made a cardinal, cementing his position as the most powerful man in England after - or perhaps even including - the king himself. As well as his political achievements, Wolsey left a very visible legacy in the form of his great home at Hampton Court and the foundation of Christ Church, Oxford - originally known as Cardinal College. But his downfall came after Henry, who was desperate to end his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in order to wed Anne Boleyn, tasked him with seeking an annulment from the Pope. When the annulment was not granted the king blamed Wolsey, seized his property and accused him of treason. The great cardinal died in Leicester on the way to his trial in London. City . councillor Ross Willmott said: 'The discovery of Richard III is . wonderful news, yet there remains something of a mystery about what . happened to Wolsey, who rivaled Henry VIII in wealth and power and was . one of the most significant political figures of the era. 'Arguably, . he is far more influential than Richard III. To discover his remains . would help tell the story of another historic figure linked to the . city.' 'There have been digs over the years to try to find him but they have not succeeded. I would like another go. 'It would bring more tourists to the city and further excite the interest in history and archeology that we are now seeing.' Wolsey served as royal chaplain to Henry VII, who seized the throne after Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. It is likely he was buried with great ceremony at the abbey but historians think his tomb was destroyed later in Henry VIII's reign, when abbeys were dissolved in the late 1530s after England's split with the Catholic Church. Attempts to locate Wolsey's remains during digs in 1820 and again in the 1930s drew blanks. However, Leicester Civic Society chairman Stuart Bailey said: 'His bones may have been scattered and any remnants destroyed, but for years they said that about Richard III. 'I think it would be marvellous to have another look. 'It was a great fluke that Richard was found but we know Wolsey was buried in the Lady Chapel of the abbey church, which is not all that big.'","Churchman is known to have also been buried in Leicester's abbey in 1530 .

The 3D isometric views of the city on Canada's east coast appear to show many of its high-rise buildings looking rather is if they are about to topple over.

The prominent Spanish surrealist painter Salvador Dali was well known for fantastic artworks, in which the normal laws of physics don't seem to apply. The same could be said for Google's rendering of downtown Vancouver, where many of the buildings appear to defying gravity by leaning at odd angles relative to each other. The phenomenon appears to be a glitch in Google Maps' 45-degree view feature. Comparison by MailOnline with other areas of high-rise development which are pictured with the view, including Detroit, Michigan, and Newcastle upon Tyne, shows the same glitch, but the effect is less obvious. Google released the 45-degree view imagery in its map product last September, with the initial roll-out featuring 51 cities with the feature. It was a response to the Flyover feature in Apple's iOS 6 Maps app, which was slammed by users for its bizarre rendering of many areas.

Among the landmarks touted by Google at the release of the 45 degree view was the world-famous Leaning Tower of Pisa, a free-standing bell tower which has been actually tilting since before it was even finished. The tilt is due to its construction on an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to support the tower's weight.

A Tarrant County prosecutor read an array of text messages on Wednesday that a wife claims were sent from their marriage counselor Sheila Loven, the same woman who was having an affair with her husband . Threatening and profane text messages sent from a marriage counselor to a couple she 'treated' were read out during her sexual assault trial yesterday after the court heard she used the sessions to separate the couple so she could have an affair with the husband. Sheila Loven, 47, of Euless, Texas, had been taking the Arlington couple for joint therapy in 2009 and recommended it would be better to have individual sessions. It was in these private sessions that Loven allegedly worked on turning the husband and wife against each other, persuading wife Brenda Holliday to file for a divorce and coercing the husband John into having an affair with her. The pair had sex for more than two months in 2009 and only stopped when the husband and wife spoke about their individual sessions and realized Loven was trying to separate them rather than bring them together. After they reconciled, Loven allegedly sent them a number of cruel texts until they went to police and reported her for harassment, according to the Star Telegram. One text message read: 'When are you going to figure out you are nothing without me. I made you into a man.' A message to the man's wife read: 'And then he talks about your body so bad while he's touching every inch of mine.' 'I hope you enjoyed your lunch. Didn't see me did you?' another text said. But police turned the charge into sexual assault, saying the 47-year-old used her influence as a professional counselor to persuade the husband to have sex with her. The maximum sentence is 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A tearful Brenda Holliday took the stand yesterday and testified about her relationship with Loven, which she described as 'visiting my best friend once a week to talk' Sheila Loven counseled a couple in 2009 and allegedly used her counseling influence to encourage the wife to file for divorce, then had an affair with her husband, according to prosecutors . Wife Brenda Holliday tearfully testified to the court yesterday that Loven became like a best friend to her and she believed she had found the perfect counselor, describing their visits like 'going to talk to my best friend once a week'. 'There was nothing I did not tell her,' the wife testified. 'I thought . that she genuinely cared about me and I told her how lucky I was to have . found her. She told me it was a God thing. She would always give me a . big hug before I left.' 'It wasn't marriage counseling, it was divorce counseling,' Mrs Holliday said in court. Mrs Holliday also revealed Loven told her that her husband was a 'narcissist' and had stopped coming to sessions and following her directions to save the marriage. All the while she was allegedly having an affair with him. Lead prosecutor Betty Arvin told the . jury yesterday: 'They didn't go running to the police yelling that he . was sexually assaulted. They didn't know. Most people don't know. 'Not only was what Loven was doing immoral and unethical, it was illegal.' Loven's . attorney said it was a legitimate relationship which blossomed from . romance and there is no evidence of emotional coercion. Adam Burny said: 'It had all the . elements of any other romantic relationship. They went out to nightclubs . and dinner, and they spent almost every night together. What you will . not see in this case is any evidence of manipulation.' But the prosecution argued there was . manipulation from the beginning - when she started to see them . separately to 'collect their secrets' and then using these secrets to . drive a wedge between them. Loven advised the wife to get a divorce and then asked the husband on a date. Days later, the pair began having sex. She . stopped office sessions with the husband but continued to have sex with . him, while continuing to counsel his wife, Arvin said. 'She was the ultimate inside trader,' Arvin said. 'She got information about their lives that they had never . shared with anyone and she used it, she twisted it for her own sick . reasons.' The wife also revealed yesterday that after she filed for a divorce and told her husband to leave the house, he pleaded to be allowed to return home and would call constantly, saying he was suicidal. The husband testified that he was so . depressed after the divorce papers were filed that he went only to work . and then returned home. 'I'd play Russian roulette with my .357,' the husband said. 'A couple of times I put it to my head and clicked it.' The first night he was able to go out was when Loven invited him out to a club with her. The next day she invited him over to her house when he said she straddled him and kissed her. According to the star Telegram he told the court: 'Sheila got up from the chair and . straddled me and kissed me. It scared me. I hadn't . kissed anyone except my wife for years and years.' Mrs Holliday said that when Loven eventually confessed to her that she was the one having an affair withher husband, she said to her: 'For a year, you told me what a mess-up . he is, and you're a licensed professional counselor. 'Why would you want him? She said everything that she said . about him is what she loved about him. As she left, she hugged me and . told me that she loved me.'

Unbeknown: Two million Brits were feared to be eating horse without knowing it, due to a racket that saw at least 750,000 horses slaughtered before it was eventually stamped out . Suspect: Newsreel company British Pathe has re-released historical footage that exposed a previous black market trade that involved horse meat being passed off to unsuspecting diners on a massive scale . It was legal to buy horse meat from butchers in 1948, but the price was strictly controlled – which led to gangs passing it off as other meat in order to cash in. The British Pathe archive film has been posted onto YouTube and on the British Pathe website. The narrator speaks over footage of horses being led to market and horse meat being taken into butcher’s shops. Full circle: The horse meat scandal engulfing Britain is a mirror image of a similar crisis that occurred in the UK food chain in 1948 . Viewers are told: 'Public feeling grows against this sinister trade. The country demands action against a traffic so alien to the British people.' Earlier in the clip, the newsreader outlined the scale of the problem and warned that veal from foals was also being sold. He said: 'Horse meat is rapidly becoming part of Britain’s diet. Three million people buy it every week, but less than half that number know it. 'Only one in three buys from the butcher who sells at the controlled price of a shilling a pound. All in a day's work: A plummy-voiced narrator speaks over footage of horses being led to market and horsemeat being taken into butcher's shops . For sale: Earlier in the clip, the newsreader outlined the scale of the problem and warned that veal from foals was also being sold . 'It is estimated that three quarters of the horse meat sold goes to the backstreet restaurants, where the customers are offered black market steaks – or even veal - the flesh of foals.' Viewers were then warned that the gangs involved were operating nationwide. The narrator continued: 'To supply . this sordid market, agents scour the country, they are present at every . horse fair to buy meat on the hoof, viewing the animals with a butcher’s . eye. 'Eight out of ten horses sold these days (in 1948) are said to reach the slaughterhouses. The narrator said 'Horsemeat is rapidly becoming part of Britain's diet.

Doctors are calling for an end to the prescribing of gluten-free foods on the health service. The 50-year-old practice is stuck in a ‘time warp’ and forces GPs to behave like grocers, it is claimed. Prescriptions for gluten-free food cost £27million a year in England – some of which could be better spent on medication for the seriously ill, says GP Dr James Cave, editor of the independent review of medical treatment, the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin. Critic: Dr James Cave, editor of the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin, called for an end to gluten-free prescriptions, saying they were introduced when the foods were not widely available in shops . Mr Cave wants the system to be overhauled, writing in a magazine editorial with deputy editor David Phizackerley. Gluten-free foods are prescribed to those with coeliac disease, an auto-immune condition triggered by gluten, a protein in wheat, rye and barley. The DTB editorial says prescriptions were introduced before the foods became widely available in shops. Dr Cave said the NHS must find a better way to support coeliac patients, possibly with vouchers for gluten-free foods. Gluten can be found in cakes, biscuits, pasta, beer and bread, as well as in a wide range of products from soy sauce to fish fingers, and mayonnaise to baked beans. The cost of buying gluten free foods without the help of prescriptions can be ‘prohibitive’ for patients, with the products up to 500 per cent higher than the ‘normal’ equivalents. Better use: Dr Cave said some of the money that is used for gluten-free prescriptions, which cost £27million every year in England, could be used on medication to treat serious illnesses . A small loaf can cost around £3, a pack of crumpets £1.70 and a cake £3. But the prescribing system is outmoded and costly, adding a layer of unnecessary red tape to the NHS which takes up healthcare professionals’ time and is unhelpful to patients, the editorial says. Dr Cave said the current system racks up costs at every level, from dispensing fees paid to pharmacists to charges made by wholesalers, and can be inefficient for patients waiting for their orders to arrive. Dr Cave’s own GP practice includes a pharmacy which allows him to see where the savings can be made, he added. Source: Gluten can be found in cakes, biscuits, pasta, beer and bread, as well as in a wide range of products from soy sauce to fish fingers, and mayonnaise to baked beans . He said ‘Sometimes I have to act more like a grocer than a GP when the orders come in and the food stacks up. ‘It’s an antiquated system stuck in a time warp which works like an old-fashioned cartel, but it’s NHS money and budgets for cancer and other drugs are under pressure.’ Some trusts will no longer authorise prescribing of gluten free cakes and sweet biscuits because it doesn’t promote healthy eating. Gluten free foods have a unit value - for example 400g bread equals one unit - and male coeliac patients are entitled to 18 units a month, with women getting 14 units. Dr Cave said he did not want to see the NHS stop helping coeliac patients, as the financial burden for the ‘vulnerable’ might be considerable. ‘But it is time to consider the use of food vouchers that could be redeemed against gluten-free foods at any outlet so the supply of food would no longer be a medical issue’ he added. The charity Coeliac UK said support was needed as gluten free foods can can cost much more than regular foods and are often not available in budget or convenience stores relied upon by those on low incomes, the elderly, disabled or those living in remote rural areas. Sarah Sleet, Chief Executive of Coeliac UK said ‘Following a gluten-free diet enables patients to live a full and healthy life. However, to do so, it is crucial that they are able to access basic gluten-free foods, such as bread, flour and pasta, which are the staples in all our diets. ‘If you are elderly, on low incomes or have mobility problems there is a gap because such foods are likely to be inaccessible. They cost too much or can’t be found in the shops you can get to. 'Prescriptions are providing an essential service for these vulnerable groups.’ She said the charity is willing to consider any scheme, including vouchers, which continues to support the vulnerable and for new ways to cut red tape. She said: ‘People with coeliac disease would ideally like to shop for their food like everyone else. If we can address the cost and availability issues in retail shops there would not be a need for prescriptions. ‘In the meantime, we agree that we need to find the most cost effective way to support patients. This is why we have promoted a pharmacy supply scheme which is proven to reduce costs and save GP time. ‘Such schemes are already up and running in England and an all Scotland scheme has been reported as being on the cards.’","Editor of the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin wants system overhauled .

Worrying: Lung cancer deaths in British women outnumber those from breast cancer and will continue rising for the rest of the decade, warn researchers. Smoking has been blamed for the predicted increase . Lung cancer deaths in British women outnumber those from breast cancer and will continue rising for the rest of the decade, warn researchers. At a time when death rates from other cancers are falling, an international survey shows lung cancer is the biggest killer in the UK, which has the highest rate in Europe. Figures published today predict a rising number of cancer deaths across 27 countries in Europe, reaching 1.3million in 2013, although the rate of deaths per head of population is actually declining. A group of researchers from Italy and Switzerland estimate that, compared with 2009, the overall level of cancer deaths has fallen 6 per cent among men and 4 per cent in women. Experts say advances in treatment and management are responsible for falling death rates in almost every form of the disease, except for lung cancer in women. It will continue rising because women took up smoking later in the 20th century than men, which means cancer develops later. In the UK, lung cancer is the biggest cause of cancer death in women claiming almost 16,000 lives a year compared with 12,000 from breast cancer, and the rest of Europe is catching up. Lung cancer deaths have risen by 7 per cent among women in Europe since 2009, says the study published in the cancer journal Annals of Oncology. One of the study’s authors, Professor Carlo La Vecchia, head of the Department of Epidemiology at the Mario Negri Institute and professor at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Milan, said: ‘If these opposite trends in breast and lung cancer rates continue, then in 2015 lung cancer is going to become the first cause of cancer mortality in Europe. ‘This is already true in the UK and Poland, the two countries with the highest rates: 21.2 and 17.5 per 100,000 women respectively. 'This predicted rise of female lung cancer in the UK may reflect the increased prevalence of young women starting smoking in the late 1960s and 1970s, possibly due to changing socio-cultural attitudes at that time. ‘However, fewer young women nowadays in the UK and elsewhere in Europe are smoking and, therefore, deaths from lung cancer may start to level off after 2020 at around 15 per 100,000 women.’ Deaths from breast cancer have been declining steadily, with a 7 per cent fall in rates since 2009 in the EU. Killer: In the UK, lung cancer is the biggest cause of cancer death in women claiming almost 16,000 lives a year. This is a file picture . Although lung cancer is still the main cause of cancer death among men, with 187,000 deaths predicted for 2013, giving a death rate of 37.2 per 100,000 men, this represents a  6 per cent fall since 2009. Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: ‘The prediction that lung cancer will overtake breast cancer as the main cause of death among European women is a real concern. ‘If we are to avoid such statistics remaining with us well into the 21st century, we will need to continue pushing for tobacco control measures such as standardised packaging for cigarettes and a ban on point of sale.’ Sally Greenbrook, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘It’s encouraging that breast cancer mortality rates in the UK and across Europe are falling. ‘However, we must not become complacent as there is still more vital work to be done. ‘We need to dedicate more research into the prevention and treatment of these diseases to save more lives in the future.’","An international survey shows lung cancer is the biggest killer in the UK .

A gravely ill baby has become the youngest heart patient in Britain to be fitted with a mini-defibrillator inside her chest as doctors battle to save her life. Carina Marcangelo has cardiomyopathy, a disease that damages the heart. She is on a life support machine and the waiting list for a heart transplant. She spent her first birthday yesterday under complete sedation at Royal Brompton Hospital in London. Carina Marcangelo is on a a life support machine and waiting for a heart transplant after being diagnosed with the heart condition cardiomyopathy . Carina with her sister Emily, four. The toddler is the youngest heart patient in Britain to be fitted with a mini-defibrillator to keep her heart beating . In Carina's case, her cardiomyopathy means her left ventricle has a thickened wall which stops the heart working as well as it should. She was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in July last year and is currently on a life support machine and completely sedated, after taking a turn for the worse on Saturday. The defibrillator device gives a shock if her heart . goes into a dangerous rhythm. She became the youngest child to have had . an ICD (as they are known) fitted in November when she was just nine months old. After taking ill at home on October 14, Carina was rushed to Evelina Children's Hospital, London, until a bed became available at the Royal Brompton, where she has remained for the past four months. Carina was put on the transplant . list on the day of her surgery and is on the urgent list when she is on . life support. As soon as she comes off life support, she goes back on to . the active list, falling down the list.

The Marcangelo family have been told several times they might lose Carina and are hoping the hospital can keep her stable . 'They can't give you any idea of time other than average waiting times, which is about three months. Now we have been waiting three months and nothing has come up yet.' To get a heart that is the correct size, Carina can only receive a heart from a one-year-old to a small five-year-old. Mr Marcangelo said: 'At the moment they are trying to keep her as stable as possible and cool her temperature right down. 'We don't know how long she will be on life support for. It could be until a heart becomes available. She is in such a fragile state at the moment.' He is urging people to sign up to the organ donation register so that others, like Carina, are given a chance at life. He said: 'If it's something you agree . with you should sign up, but most importantly make sure your loved ones . know your wishes because it is the next of kin who will have to make . those decisions. 'It . is very difficult for parents to make that decision about their child, . but you have to consider it because what if something happens to them.'

With the leading lady a 12-year-old cow called Ida and the story set against the backdrop of a Sussex dairy farm, it doesn't scream 'Oscar winner'. But a documentary about maverick farmer Stephen Hook and his herd of 55 cows has won the hearts of the judges at Robert Redford's prestigious Sundance Film Festival. He and director Andy Heathcote are set to rub shoulders with Hollywood A-listers after The Moon Man was chosen to represent Britain at this year's competition in Park City, Utah. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Moo-vie: Farmer Steve Hook stars in the documentary alongisde his herd of 55 dairy cows in Sussex . Time for my close-up: One of Stephen Hook's herd Kitty acquaints herself with the camera and documentary maker Andy Heathcote . The real-life drama charts Stephen Hook's fight to keep his rural business afloat amid a constant battle with big supermarkets. But it is his relationship with his herd, in particular Ida the Friesian cow, which steals the show. The Moo Man will be pitched against rival offerings including Pussy Riot, a study of the three women whose struggles gained worldwide notoriety as they were jailed in Russia for their riotous performance in a Moscow cathedral. Action: The film is being entered into the World Cinema category alongside other documentaries such as Pussy Riot, a study of the Russian protest band who were jailed for for a performance at Moscow cathedral . Leading man and farmer Mr Hook has no doubts his herd of cows will tug at the heart strings and make the surprise UK entry a huge hit with critics at the international festival in Utah. He said: 'I think it's a wonderful, laugh-out-loud film but I can't quite believe it has been selected to star at such a major festival. My life is as far from Pussy Riot as it's possible to get. 'So far The Moo Man has only been shown at a private viewing to 100 family and friends at a small cinema in Hailsham near the farm. But both the adults and kids seemed to love it. 'It made them laugh and cry at different scenes and everyone seemed enchanted by the story. Getting picked for the Sundance Festival is a very big deal and something we never ever thought possible in a million years. 'It's beautifully shot and the on-screen chemistry between me and my leading lady, a half-tonne Friesian cow called Ida, is entirely down to her. I didn't choose her as the star of the show, she is the queen of the herd and just took over. 'She was a natural show-off when the cameras started rolling. We joked that Ida was really milking her screen debut because she certainly liked the spotlight.' The film took a painstaking 130 hours . and two years to make at the picturesque farm where Mr Hook and his . father Phil have worked for more than 20 years as a partnership . producing organic milk. And . behind the scene-stealing qualities displayed by Ida and the herd are the . serious problems the family has faced to stay afloat. Milking it: The film follows farmer Stephen Hook in his battle to keep his dairy business afloat . Setting the scene: Stephen Hook and his father Phil have been running the dairy farm in Sussex . Featured are long working days of milking duties and deliveries while big business interests try and undercut his efforts. But Steve knows every cow by name and says he shares a real bond with each animal. In one scene he takes favourite cow Ida to nearby Eastbourne to try and generate more business with a beach photo shoot to find she enjoys the seaside so much she refuses to leave. Steve also spends hours with a cow too weak to rejoin the herd after a difficult birth that creates a tear-jerking drama. The Moo Man has been made by the small Sussex-based Trufflepig production company and will be screened at the Sundance Festival billed as 'You will never see cows the same way again.' Director Andy Heathcote explained: 'We wanted to show the extraordinary bond we can still have with the animals we farm. 'It became obvious during filming that Steve has a wonderful relationship with his animals, a bond that most of us have forgotten can exist. But his way of life is seriously under threat. 'I live near the farm and thought it would make a compelling story, never expecting the recognition it is attracting.' Making the movie meant shivering through mid winter milking, crouching in damp meadows for summer calvings and dodging the odd stampede. Now Steve and Andy will travel to the festival, where the film is entered in the World Documentary section, this weekend. It has also been selected for the Berlin Film Festival. The driving force behind the Sundance Film Festival, actor Robert Redford, started the event in 1978. Steve added: 'I can't believe the company I will be keeping in the next few days. We have such a quiet life normally but we have a great film and I am sure it will be popular. 'It started being about one farmer bucking the trend and taking on the supermarkets but in the end what came across most strongly was the characters of the cows. 'Like humans they are all different characters. But they are beautiful animals and worthy of the red carpet treatment.'","90-minute documentary to represent Britain at prestigious competition .

Every new car could be connected to the internet by next year as billions of pounds are invested in creating the vehicles of the future, experts predict. 'Connected cars' will allow motorists to access the internet as they drive using only voice commands. Using similar technology to smart phones, it is believed cars could have internet screens displayed on dashboards by 2014. Experts say the 'connected car' technology could actually make driving safer by stopping people using their phones in the car but allowing them information without needing to touch a button . It would mean people could find free parking spaces, access restaurant reviews of even be given a countdown of when traffic lights will change - without needing to touch a button. Jack Bergquist, from information company IHS, told BBC: 'By the end of 2014, for some of the bigger brands, every vehicle they sell will offer some sort of connectivity.' He said over half of drivers would be attracted to a car that had internet capability. It could be especially popular as driving with hand-held phones was made illegal in the UK in 2003. Mr Bergquist told the MailOnline that some brands such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes were already looking at offering full internet connections in their cars. He cited Facebook as an example of how the technology could be used. Facebook statuses or tweets on Twitter could be read out and then changed by the driver using a voice command. He said that major brands are already spending as much as one third of their budget on in-car entertainment and technology. Intel, . which has invested £64million over the next five years in the 'connected cars' say it is among the fastest growing technologies. Self-driving and self-parking technology is already being used by many car brands . Only phones and tablets are growing faster, according to the BBC. New advances in self-driving are regularly revealed. Last month, Audi announced that its self driving technology could be commonplace within a decade. The firm believes the cars could be capable of picking owners up from a shopping trip and then parking itself. However, some people are concerned the more control that is taken away from the driver, the higher the safety risk. According to the National Safety Council about 25 per cent of all crashes in the United States are caused by mobile phone use. John Ellis, global technologist for connected services and solutions at Ford, was quoted in the BBC as saying: 'The danger is safety. You could get caught up your experience and forget that you're driving.' He said people want safety to remain a priority of manufacturers. But Mr Bergquist said this technology could actually reduce the number of crashes. He said: 'I think it is actually a good thing. People are already using Facebook or crazy things like that [while driving]. The legislation does not stop 95 per cent of people using phones. 'You can't stop people from doing this but car manufacturers are able to create a system that is a million times safer than people updating Facebook on a phone in their laps.'","Smart phone technology could be used to imbed the internet in cars .

Hormone replacement therapy may slow the ageing process in middle-aged women susceptible to Alzheimer’s disease. A new study found healthy menopausal women who carried a well-known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s did not experience a decline when they took HRT. The gene variant, known as ApoE4, has been shown to accelerate biological ageing. HRT may slow the ageing process in middle-aged women susceptible to Alzheimer's disease . Doctor Natalie Rasgon, professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said: 'ApoE4 is contributing to ageing at the cellular level well before any outward symptoms of decline become apparent. 'Yet, oestrogen [found in HRT] appears to have a protective effect for middle-aged women who are carrying this genetic risk factor.' Numerous previous studies have suggested that ApoE4 contributes to age-related mental decline and Alzheimer’s disease. The gene variant is present in about 40 per cent of people with late-onset Alzheimer’s. Prof Rasgon’s team focused on telomeres - caps on the ends of chromosomes that keep DNA stable and act like genetic fuses. Every time a cell divides, its telomeres shorten. The research indicates that rapid biological ageing might be associated with Alzheimer¿s in some women . If they become too short, the cell can die or lose its ability to divide further. This translates to visible signs of ageing, such as wrinkled skin, and other harmful effects within the body. Telomere shortening varies between individuals and can be used as a measure of biological ageing. The scientists analysed telomeres from white blood cells in samples taken from almost 70 healthy women, mostly aged between 45 and 65, who were on HRT . Women were randomly divided into two groups. One remained on hormone therapy while the other halted treatment. Two years later, the telomeres were checked again and the researchers calculated the rate at which their length had changed. The telomeres of women carrying the Alzheimer’s gene were six times more likely than those of non-carriers to have undergone significant shortening over the two year period. On average, telomeres of women with ApoE4 had shortened by an amount that would normally be expected in a decade. The women had effectively aged five times faster than non-carriers. But HRT cancelled out the negative influence of the gene on telomere length. Women with ApoE4 who continued to have hormone replacement showed no evidence of rapid telomere shortening. 'This brings us a step closer to being able to identify which women will benefit the most from oestrogen replacement therapy,' Professor Ragson said.","Some women have a gene variant, known as ApoE4, which raises risk of developing Alzheimer's .

The discovery of a vital ingredient for fertiliser under the North York Moors has prompted a 'gold rush' as people race to invest in a company that plans to mine it. A massive deposit of polyhalite – a mineral which contains potash, essential for fertiliser - has sparked thousands of people snapping up shares in the Sirius Minerals, which plans to mine the reserve. In January the firm applied for planning permission to construct the pithead in the North York Moors National Park, a conservation area. The potash mine has promised new jobs, but some locals fear the development will destroy the tranquility of the park . The firm maintains it is the only place it could be done, and would not be intrusive as barely any of the machinery will be seen, according to the Financial Times. They say the shaft will be underground, and have chosen an area ion high ground with a forest plantation to shield it and not ruin the view. The £1.1bn project is expected to create 1,000 jobs and there are 4,225 shareholders in Yorkshire and Teesside - which together own nine per cent of Sirius, according to the newspaper. Since December thousands of shares have been bought by people eager to cash in on the mucky mine of th emineral. The North York Moors, near Whitby, has a rich reserve of potash - an essential mineral for fertiliser . The park's local HSBC bank has had customers regularly coming in to purchase shares in the Aim-listed company, such is the eagerness to profit from the discovery. The project includes a 27-mile (43km) underground pipeline to transport the potash ore from North Yorkshire to Teesside. The company said the pipeline was the most environmentally acceptable solution for moving the ore, as it will significantly cut the amount of traffic transporting the deposit. The name stems from 'pot ash', the process used before the industrial revolution of soaking plant ashes in a pot to draw out potassium carbonate, that was left in a white ash. Potash is the common term for fertiliser forms of the element potassium (K). The mineral is the 7th most common element in the earth's crust and is an essential ingredient for fertiliser. Chris Fraser, managing director and chief executive of Sirius Minerals, said the project would create 'significant new jobs' and improve local skills 'for generations to come'. But some neighbours are dismayed at the plans, saying the mine will destroy the tranquility of the beautiful area, the BBC reported. The moors are renowned for their stunning, peaceful character, and tourism jobs are vital for the area's economy. The National Park Authority plans to hold public meetings as part of a consultation process, and a decision on the proposal is expected in May. The authority said it would assess the potential economic benefits and the environmental impacts of the mine before reaching any decision.","Investors race to snap up shares in company that wants to mine reserve .

The father of 17 accused of killing six of his children in a house fire once ordered his toddler son to punch his mother in the face because she dared to stand up to him, a court heard yesterday. Heather Kehoe, 33, told a jury how Michael Philpott took her virginity when she was just 15, then subjected her to years of physical and mental abuse. The pair ran away together a fortnight after her 16th birthday, when his first wife walked in on them having sex. Within six months, the teenager was pregnant with the first of two sons she bore him during a violent relationship which culminated in Philpott ordering their son Mikey to punch her. Miss Kehoe told how she was trying to get her son ready for bed but the ‘dominant’ Philpott ordered her to put him down. When she replied, ‘He’s my son too’, Philpott began manhandling her towards the back garden – where he would occasionally send her as a ‘punishment’. Mick Philpott's former partner Heather Kehoe claims the father (right, with wife Mairead) was abusive towards her because she would not get pregnant again . Tragedy: Mick Philpott is accused of killing six of his children (pictured) in a house fire in his Derby home . When she again tried to resist, she said Philpott ordered Mikey to ‘punch me in the face and kick me’. Struggling to contain her emotion, she said the boy, then aged two or three, carried out his father’s orders. Yesterday, she said that testifying against Philpott was ‘not about revenge’ but ‘about people needing to know what sort of a person he is.’ Nottingham Crown Court heard how she first met Philpott at a lake near her school which she used to frequent with her friends and where he would go fishing. She was 14 and he 37. She said ‘intimacy had been slowly building’ between them for almost a year when they slept together for the first time. Then, soon after the pair eloped in 1996 – and she was disowned by her parents – Philpott made her pregnant and quickly secured the three-bedroom Derby council house he is now accused of setting ablaze. The court heard that after parting from Miss Kehoe, Philpott went on to enjoy a ‘three-way relationship’ at the property with the woman who would become his  second wife and a mistress, Lisa Willis, 29. Philpott, 56, his wife Mairead, 31, and his ‘best friend’ Paul Mosley, 45, are all accused of manslaughter on the basis that they set fire to the house to frame Miss Willis, who had walked out on Philpott with her five children three months previously. The home where the Philpotts lived, with the caravan that the father used to sleep with his wife and mistress on alternate nights . Mick Philpott (middle) on his wedding day with bridesmaid Lisa Willis (left, whose face is obscured for legal reasons) and unknown woman on the right. Mairead said Miss Willis was 'like the sister she never had' Philpott's first wife was Pamela Lomax, with whom he had three children; two sons and a daughter all aged in their twenties. Their marriage came to an end when he began an affair with a teenage Heather Kehoe in 1995. She went on to have two sons with him, now aged in their early teens. Philpott went on to have an unconventional relationship with his second wife, Mairead, and his mistress, Lisa Willis, with all three sharing a home. Miss Willis, 29, was even a bridesmaid for Mick and Mairead at the couple’s 2003 wedding. Philpott was father to Mairead’s daughter Jade, and sons, John, Jack, Jessie and Jayden. Duwayne, Mairead’s son from a previous relationship, also lived with the pair. All six of the children died after the house fire last May. He had three daughters and a son with Miss Willis, who had another child from a previous relationship - also raised as Philpott's. The 56-year-old is understood to have another son, aged five, who he once described as being the product of a liaison with the partner of a friend. Hours after the fatal blaze last May, Philpott and Miss Willis had been due to face each other in a court custody hearing to decide their children’s place of residence. Miss Kehoe, of Rainworth, Nottinghamshire, wept as she outlined the treatment she received at the hands of her ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ lover, who she said was a ‘good father’ in public but not behind closed doors. She said Philpott could be caring but ‘everything had to be his way’ or he would ‘lash out and be violent’. The court heard how he emptied her childhood savings account of £1,500 and harvested all the money she made from a full-time airport cleaning job.

Miss Kehoe said Philpott joked of wanting 11 children – enough for a football team. She said that when she secretly started using contraception to scupper his hopes for more children, her ‘life got worse’ because Philpott became frustrated. The court heard the relationship ended in 2000 when Miss Kehoe fled to a police station after being thrown out of the house by Philpott during a violent row.

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 12:32 EST, 12 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:29 EST, 12 February 2013 . An out-of-hours doctor has been jailed for two-and-a-half years for manslaughter after he failed to send a seriously ill diabetic man to hospital - diagnosing him as 'depressed with a headache'. Dr Bala Kovvali ignored the classic signs of diabetes-related poisonous acids building up in 42-year-old Andrew Fellows' body, a court heard. Instead of dialling 999 for an ambulance, the on-call locum told Mr Fellows' mother that her son was depressed and had a headache and should see his own doctor the next day. Less than nine hours later Mr Fellows died at home from diabetic ketoacidosis. Sheffield Crown Court heard how Mr Fellows became thirsty in the week before he died . A test which takes less than a minute would have alerted the GP to raised blood-sugar levels and it is 'virtually certain' Mr Fellows would have survived with an insulin injection and rehydration. Jailing the doctor Judge Roger Keen told him: 'It was criminal negligence and a wholly preventable death followed.' Experts who examined the case said any competent doctor would have recognised the classic symptoms of ketoacidosis and Dr Kovvali's breach of duty to his patient was 'appalling and gross.' It was revealed at Sheffield Crown Court that the GP was based in India but flew to Britain to work every summer for two or three months for the nationwide doctors' deputising service Primecare. He was arrested in the United States and extradited after a Sheffield coroner adjourned an inquest into Mr Fellows' death for police investigations. Father-of-two Kovvali, 64, admitted causing the death of Mr Fellows by gross negligence in failing to carry out an adequate clinical assessment, failing to send Mr Fellows to hospital as an emergency and failing to diagnose diabetic ketoacidosis from which he died. Michael Burrows QC, prosecuting, said Mr Fellows, who lived with his family in Handsworth, Sheffield had no medical history of diabetes but suffered from anxiety and depression. In the week before his death, the painter and decorator was working outside and became restless and began drinking huge quantities of water. Both he and his mother Brenda believed he had caught sunstroke. When her son's condition worsened Mrs Fellows called Primecare at 17.50 on June 4, 2009. She told a triage nurse her son was 'very muddled and mumbling', his breathing was erratic and his eyes were sunken with his breath smelling odd 'like pear drops.' She was asked about his depression and replied: 'He had had episodes before but if this is depression I've never seen one as bad as this.' Dr Kovvali was asked to attend Mr Fellows and arrived at 21.13. Mrs Fellows expected her son to be taken to hospital and had even packed a bag for him. Mrs Fellows asked if her son was in a coma or had an infection and specifically if he might be diabetic. 'She says Dr Kovvali shook his head to all these questions,' said Mr Burrows. 'According to Mrs Fellows, Dr Kovvali did not have any equipment with him and did not examine her son. He said he was depressed and advised that he should see his own GP the following day for his medication to be reviewed.' After the doctor left, Mrs Fellows gave her son something to drink but he could not swallow. He appeared so dehydrated she gave him an ice cube at 1am. She returned at 6am to find him dead in bed. The court heard Mr Fellows had basically run out of insulin in his body. It switched to burning fatty acids and produced acidic ketones. When ketones are produced in excess the blood becomes more acidic and blood-sugar levels rise leading to a coma which can be fatal. Professor of Forensic Medicine Ian Wall, who reviewed the case, said he considered the patient's confusion, thirst, smell, sunken eyes and inability to answer were 'classic symptoms of ketoacidosis.' Dr Kovvali should have checked sugar levels in the patient's blood or urine and he should have been immediately admitted to hospital 'where he could have been treated or saved.' Professor Robert Tattersall, a retired professor of clinical diabetes, said the GP's records were 'grossly deficient' and he could and should have measured blood sugar. 'It would have taken less than a minute and shown high blood sugar levels. Dr Kovvali should then have called for for an ambulance as an emergency... the failure to diagnose his condition was the main cause of death.' Dr Kovvali, who worked as a GP in Sheffield from 1981 to 1988 before returning to India, was arrested in the United States on August 27, 2012 and brought back to the UK. When questioned he admitted he had a blood-sugar testing kit in his car which he failed to use. Just a fortnight after Mr Fellows died, Dr Kovvali attended another patient Christopher Timms who had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and prescribed insulin. He felt unwell but the GP told him not to take his insulin as well as failing to examine him or test for ketones. A consultant said the advice to stop taking insulin was 'wholly inappropriate' and lack of insulin would have put the patient 'in a life-threatening situation in a matter of hours.' In a victim impact statement Mrs Fellows said that to test her son's blood 'would have been such a small thing to do but that one small thing would have saved her son's life.' Stephen Climie QC, defending, said the doctor had 'misdirected' himself. He had a particular interest in mental health matters and coupled with Mr Fellows not taking his medication it led him to rule out diabetes as a risk factor. He qualified as a doctor in India in 1973 and came to the UK a year later. He completed his training before becoming a GP and had been subject to appraisals in the years leading up to these events. 'He is not allowed to practise without supervision,' said Mr Climie. He had now decided to quit as a doctor and 'will not be working in the UK ever again.' His wife back in India was ill and lived alone and had been badly affected by his arrest. Judge Keen told Kovvali: 'You have devoted your working life to caring for others. I have seen glowing references as to your competence, empathy and thoughtfulness. 'It is a tragedy for you that this brought about an end to your career, destroyed your good character and your ability to work in this country.' He went on: 'However the nature of your offending is too serious for anything other than a custodial sentence. 'You failed to recognise Mr Fellows' condition despite the fact that all the classic signs of a diabetic condition were present.' He had opted for a diagnosis that was contrary to all the evidence. 'That was a gross breach of your duty of care,' said the judge. 'An expert has called your decision appalling. I agree. It was clearly criminally negligent and a wholly preventable death followed.' After the hearing Mrs Fellows said: 'We want everyone to know how much we loved Andrew. He was a loving son, brother, grandson, uncle, nephew and cousin and his death has caused a huge hole in the lives of everyone who knew him. 'He was honest and upright, funny and sensitive. He loved science and nature and was very proud of the fact that he got a BSc degree later in life. 'He was known to his friends as ""Fell"" and was described by them as the man with the hundred watt smile.'","Dr Bala Kovvali failed to recognise diabetic ketoacidosis .

A piano teacher has been jailed for . secretly selling his frail elderly mother’s house to fund his  obsession . with a £7,000-a-session prostitute. In a shocking betrayal, David Butler, . 69, and call-girl Rachel Read forged the title deeds to the . 95-year-old’s home while she was still living there. Butler, a lonely bachelor, had been a . respected musician who played the organ at his local church. But, after . meeting 39-year-old Read, ‘all he was interested in was drinking, . gambling and sex’. Callous: David Butler, pictured in the early 1970's, sold his mother's home so he could lavish money on prostitute Read (right) His mother Margaret Butler, a . great-grandmother with dementia, had no idea she no longer owned her . three-bedroom home of 62 years until she was evicted and left homeless. Butler had initially covered up his . scam by leasing the house back from the new owner and living in it with . his mother for two years. But he was so besotted with Read that he gave . into her greedy demands for thousands of pounds for their sordid . encounters, which went on for almost a decade. After spending the £170,000 he . pocketed from the fraudulent sale on the call-girl, Butler could not . afford the rent. Before long, bailiffs arrived at the house in Bicester, . Oxfordshire, exposing his terrible deceit. Read took so much money from him that she was able to drop all her other clients. Margaret says that she does not remember too much of what happened, but is sad that her son has gone to prison . Vulnerable Margaret Butler is now being looked after by her other son Graham, who says that his brother was 'besotted wit the prostitute' Eventually, Butler ended up an . alcoholic living rough on the streets while she resided in a . five-bedroom semi-detached house in Frilford, Oxfordshire, worth almost . £500,000. Judge Patrick Eccles jailed Butler . for nine months, and Read for one year, and told them: ‘The word wicked is . not too strong to describe what you did. David has been sentenced to nine months in jail for destroying his mother's life . ‘It was done by you, David Butler, so . you could get your hands on your mother’s money, and you, Rachel Read, . so you could benefit because you knew he would give you all of his money . because he was besotted with you.’ He added she could only have acted ‘out of greed’ and her victim was left ‘destitute’. Butler was supposed to be his . mother’s live-in carer. He owned half of the property, where he taught . piano and was an upstanding citizen. But that all changed when he . started hiring Read, who advertised her services as an escort online, . for sessions at the house in 2001. He quickly fell in love with her and she demanded rising amounts of money in cheques before having sex with him. Towards the end of their liaison, he . handed her two cheques worth £13,000. That was after he sold the house . in 2008 and pocketed his  mother’s £62,000 share. Yesterday, as she was comforted by . her older son  Graham, Mrs Butler said: ‘I did not want to leave. I miss . living in my own house. ‘David did an awful thing to me but I’m very old and don’t really . remember what happened. But he is still my boy and I’m sad he is in . prison. I don’t really want to say  anything bad about him.’ She is now living with Mr Butler, 74, as he took her in at his house, which is next-door to his former family home. From there, he said: ‘David completely changed after he met this woman. All he was interested in was drinking, gambling and sex. Margaret Butler (right) and David (left) are pictured with other relatives in the garden of Mrs Butler's former home in the 1970s. Her son sold the deeds to her house behind her back . ‘David and I used to be close. He used to be interested in books and he was a musician and played the organ at the church here for many years. Mum has lost everything – her home, all her money and her son to a whore who completely and utterly exploited him.’ Mr Butler said his brother told him about seeing a call-girl but he had no idea of the scam which had gone on next door. ‘He was very conceited and she knew how to play him,’ he added. ‘He was infatuated. He used to say he worshipped the ground she walked on. ‘He said, “I love her and we are going to get married”. He was obsessed with her but all she was after was money.’ Mr Butler told how bailiffs took his mother’s treasured belongings from her former home in early 2011. ‘She went out waving a stick  and it would have been a funny sight if it wasn’t just so sad,’ he said. ‘She loved that house. The sentences are too lenient. They destroyed her life.’ Butler and Read both denied forgery and acquiring or possessing criminal property but were convicted by a jury at Oxford Crown Court. Read also denied a charge of fraud but was found guilty.","David Butler sold his 95-year-old mother's home to pay prostitute .

"By . Anna Edwards and James Salmon . PUBLISHED: . 04:20 EST, 12 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:42 EST, 12 February 2013 . Barclays has come under fire for dishing out average bonuses of £51,400 to its investment bankers, despite axing 3,700 jobs and a spiralling compensation bill. The embattled lender broke the grim news to employees yesterday as it revealed its profits for last year had slumped to £246million, from £5.9billion a year earlier. The huge drop was driven in part by a £2.5billion bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance and complicated ‘interest rate swaps’ to small businesses. But campaigners last night asked why Barclays was awarding huge bonuses after ‘one of the worst years in its history’. The bank has been fighting to restore its reputation since being fined £290million last summer for rigging crucial interest rates. Antony Jenkins, who replaced disgraced former boss Bob Diamond following the debacle, yesterday promised ‘no going back to the old ways’ as he revealed his plans to turn Barclays into the ‘go-to’ bank for customers and shareholders. He said ‘we get it’, referring to the public anger about the behaviour of the 320-year-old bank. Speaking at London’s Royal Horticultural Halls, surrounded by walls emblazoned with the bank’s five new core values – respect, integrity, service, excellence and stewardship – Mr Jenkins confirmed plans to shut down its controversial ‘tax avoidance’ arm, Structured Capital Markets. This was used to cut the tax bill for the bank itself and its wealthy clients. But Mr Jenkins admitted the bank would not wind down tax avoidance schemes already set up for rich customers. Critics poured scorn on its  efforts to show restraint on bonuses. The bonus pool was cut from £2.2billion to £1.85billion, and Barclays has also cut bonuses for investment bankers by 15 per cent to £1.3billion. Despite this, staff will receive average bonuses of £51,400, even though they work in the part of the bank involved in the rigging of interest rates. Deborah Hargreaves, chairman of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘This will look like more of the same to members of the public. ‘The idea that any bonuses should be paid out after one of the most scandalous years in Barclays’ long history infringes on most people’s idea of fairness.’ Barclays Chief Executive Antony Jenkins says the bank needs to change to survive a difficult period . Shareholders were evidently pleased . with the announcement that the bank is trimming back its staff and . slashing costs - as the share price today quickly rose when the FTSE100 . opened. At 8.30am Barclays' share price was 303.54 - and by 9.16am it was 315.85 - a rise of 4.05 per cent. Barclays . published two different sets of results - one showing the pre-tax . results in a statutory basis and the other on an adjusted basis. On an adjusted basis, the bank's pre-tax profits rose by 26 per cent from £5.59bn in 2011 to £7.048bn in 2012. In the report, Mr Jenkins said that . Barclays 'needs to change' if it is to survive the difficult . circumstances the banking sector is experiencing. 'There is no doubt that 2012 was a difficult year for Barclays and the entire banking sector,' he said. 'The behaviours which made headlines during the year stemmed from a period of 20 years in banking in which the sector became too aggressive, too focused on the short-term, and too disconnected from the needs of customers and clients, and wider society. 'Barclays was not immune from the impact of these trends, and we suffered reputational damage in 2012 as a consequence, . 'Change is needed both in our industry and at Barclays.' Barclays said 1,600 jobs have already been cut in the investment banking business since the start of the year. Mr Jenkins, who was appointed in . August after Bob Diamond quit in the wake of the bank's £290 million . Libor rigging settlement, insisted bonuses had been reduced after last . year's string of reputational blows. He said the bank's compensation ratio - pay as a proportion of revenues - had fallen to 38 per cent from 42 per cent in 2011. Mr . Jenkins announced he was waiving his bonus for 2012 earlier this month, . but the overall staff bonus pot for 2012 is likely to stoke further . controversy given the recent series of scandals to rock the group. His overhaul - dubbed Project Transform - . saw the bank broken down into 75 business units, which were examined . for both their potential to generate sustainable profit and their . ability to inflict reputational damage. Mr Jenkins added: 'Barclays is changing. We intend to change what Barclays does and how we do it.' Barclays is attempting to overhaul its image . Barclays said profits rose 26 per cent to £7.05 billion on an underlying basis, with mis-selling provisions stripped out and not including movements in the value of its own debt. Bottom line profits were heavily impacted by mis-selling provisions. It said the average PPI claim stood at £2,750, while it added the group sold around 4,000 interest rate swaps to small businesses of which around 3,000 were liable to potential mis-selling claims.Barclays said its investment banking business delivered a 37 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to £4.1 billion in 2012. Its UK retail and business banking division saw profits tumble 71% to £292 million after PPI provisions, although it said profits rose 4% to £1.5 billion on an underlying basis. Unite national officer Dominic Hook . said: 'The chief executive's promise of a culture shift at the bank is . to be welcomed but we need to see more progress to address the gap . between the highest paid and the lowest paid staff at Barclays, which is . huge. 'It's shocking but . true that the starting salary at Barclays is just £13,500 a year, making . some workers at the bank eligible to claim tax credits. 'With . pay negotiations due to start soon, Unite will be expecting the bank to . reward its staff fairly for their contribution to the success of the . bank.'","1,800 investment banking posts will be slashed .

Bill Worthington, of Bredbury, Greater Manchester, has pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to a squirrel. The 75-year-old trapped it and shot it with his air rifle, but it did not die immediately . After watching it raid his garden bird table once too often, Bill Worthington decided enough was enough. The retired civil servant set a trap for his bushy-tailed foe and lay in wait. It didn’t take long for the grey squirrel to take the bait and, with the animal cornered in the make-shift cage, the 75-year-old from Stockport, Greater Manchester, shot it twice with his air rifle. He went shopping but, when he returned two hours later, the animal was still alive so he shot it a further three times. Yesterday it emerged Worthington  is facing up to six months in jail or a £5,000 fine after being hauled before the courts for causing unnecessary suffering to the squirrel. The keen crown green bowler and bird lover was reported to the RSPCA by a neighbour who spotted the animal, maimed, but still alive in his garden. The five shots failed to kill the animal and it was later put down. Worthington pleaded guilty but told the hearing he had been ‘provoked’ by the activities of the squirrels, which he described as ‘garden rats’ and ‘vermin’. Speaking afterwards, he said: ‘I cannot believe I have been taken to court over this one grey squirrel, which, frankly, has been a pest and vermin. It does seem over the top. ‘I just wanted to keep my garden nice and feed the birds, yet these squirrels kept coming in and taking all the food. ‘They seem to wait in the trees until I’m not in the garden before striking. They dig up my garden and they eat the bird feed. In my mind they are a real problem. ‘I don’t want people to think I don’t like animals – far from it. I used to work on a farm years ago and I have a budgie called Peter who is marvellous, so clever.’ Wounded: X-Rays of the dead squirrel showing pellet wounds after Bill repeatedly shot it . He fired on the animal after it stole bird food from his garden in Stockport, Greater Manchester . Claire Aldridge, prosecuting, told Stockport Magistrates’ Court that the RSPCA was alerted on September 27 last year by a neighbour who had spotted the injured squirrel in the garden of Worthington’s home, in Bredbury. She said: ‘The squirrel had been trapped in a cage in the defendant’s garden. Worthington took his .22 air rifle and shot at it two times. When interviewed by the RSPCA Worthington referred to squirrels as 'vermin' and 'garden rats' 'The defendant went shopping at approximately 11am and left the squirrel in the trap. 'Later when he returned, it was still grabbing at the cage and biting it. 'So the defendant shot the squirrel a further three times at around 2:30pm. He left the squirrel in the trap and went out.’ Worthington, who left to visit his sick wife in a care home, said he assumed the animal was dead, but when the RSPCA arrived at 4.20pm it was still alive. ‘The RSPCA recovered a live squirrel in the middle of the defendant’s garden,’ Miss Aldridge said. ‘This defendant shot a squirrel five times over five hours. He said he didn’t care about the suffering of the animal. The method of dispatch should be carried out humanely. 'What he did was unacceptably cruel and entirely unnecessary. He found it comical that the RSPCA were even investigating.’ Lee Strap, the vet who eventually put down the animal, confirmed it had multiple pellet wounds and was alive but unresponsive. When questioned by RSPCA officers Worthington was described as ‘obtrusive’. He confirmed he was a user of a .22 rifle and referred to the squirrels as ‘vermin’ and ‘garden rats’. Worthington, defending himself, added: ‘We are talking about one squirrel here. The vet says the squirrel was “alive but not responsive”. That’s how I saw it. I tried my best to have away with it but I had other things to do.’ Magistrates granted Worthington unconditional bail. He will be sentenced next month.

Guilty: Heroin addict David Edgerton, 22, was found guilty of the abduction and rape of a 14-year-old girl . A schoolgirl sent messages to her family via Facebook pleading for help while she was being raped in woods near her home. The 14-year-old used her mobile phone to write ‘help’ and ‘raping me’ on her sister’s profile page on the site, a court was told. But although the messages alerted her mother and sister, who eventually discovered her collapsed by the roadside, they were too late to stop her ordeal. Yesterday a judge criticised the police and Crown Prosecution Service after it emerged they had missed three chances to catch her attacker, David Edgerton, 22, in the months leading up to the rape. Judge Merfyn Hughes QC said the girl may have been spared had they apprehended or prosecuted Edgerton, of Connah’s Quay, north Wales, for an earlier rape, an attempted rape and an attack on a girl of ten. Mold Crown Court was told that Edgerton, a heroin addict, was prowling Leeswood, north Wales, looking for his next victim on the afternoon of August 22 last year. He approached a 13-year-old girl sitting by a community centre and asked her for directions to a pub. She refused to accompany him and he left when a male friend of the girl’s arrived to meet her. But less than two hours later Edgerton saw the 14-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, at a chip shop and asked her to show him where the pub was. John Philpotts, prosecuting, told the court: ‘As they walked in the village he held her tightly, grabbed her hair and threatened her not to raise the alarm. ‘He dragged her into Blast Woods where she was raped. ‘Despite her ordeal, she was able to send messages which said “help” and “raping me” from her mobile phone on to the Facebook site of her sister. She got messages to her family to try to explain where she was.’ By this time, the girl’s mother and sister were looking for her because she had not come home. She later told police she could hear them calling her while she was being attacked. Eventually she escaped and was found by her mother in a terrible state, Mr Philpotts added. The court was told that in June 2009 Edgerton tried to rape a 20-year-old school friend after breaking into her home. In December 2011, he attacked a girl of ten but was stopped when a member of the public intervened. Missed opportunities: Judge Merfyn Hughes QC criticised the CPS at Mold Crown Court after it emerged they missed three previous opportunities to catch Edgerton . Then, in August last year, less than a fortnight before he raped the 14-year-old, he raped a woman who invited him to her flat. Edgerton denied one count of rape, one attempted rape and attempted abduction but was convicted after a three-day trial. He admitted assault with intent to commit a sex offence and the abduction and rape of the 14-year-old. Judge Hughes told Edgerton: ‘You must realise that the sentence you will receive will be a very long one.’","David Edgerton, 22, will be sentenced next month after admitting rape .

Internet search giant Google is evading privacy settings of Internet Explorer users, claims Microsoft, the computer firm behind the browser. Dean Hachamovitch, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for Internet Explorer, accused Google in a blog post yesterday and said that the search giant has been contacted and asked to stop the practice. Mr Hachamovitch explained that it was after reading reports that Google was bypassing the privacy settings on Apple’s Safari browser that the discovery was made. He wrote: ‘When the IE team heard that Google had bypassed user privacy settings on Safari, we asked ourselves a simple question: Is Google circumventing the privacy preferences of Internet Explorer users too? We’ve discovered the answer is yes: Google is employing similar methods to get around the default privacy protections in IE and track IE users with cookies.’ Rachel Whetstone, Senior Vice President of Communications and Policy, however, defended Google's activities. She said: 'Microsoft omitted important information from its blog post. 'Microsoft uses a “self-declaration” protocol - known as “P3P” - dating from 2002 under which Microsoft asks websites to represent their privacy practices in machine-readable form. It is well known - including by Microsoft - that it is impractical to comply with Microsoft’s request while providing modern web functionality. We have been open about our approach, as have many other websites. 'Today the Microsoft policy is widely non-operational. A 2010 research report indicated that over 11,000 websites were not issuing valid P3P policies as requested by Microsoft.' Google had allegedly been circumventing privacy protection settings on Safari to build up profiles of web users, using a 'cookie' that collected advertising information. Safari is the most popular mobile web browser, used in all models of Apple's iPhone and iPad. It comes shortly after EU privacy groups wrote to the search giant to ask it to 'halt' a new privacy policy that would allow it to 'share' customer data between services such as Search, Gmail and YouTube. Hot water: Google has also been accused of circumventing Safari's privacy settings . Google allegedly used a 'trick' which sends a blank message to the browser to make it accept unauthorised 'cookies'. Apple says it is 'working to put a stop' to the practice. The code was uncovered by a Stanford University researcher Jonathan Mayer and was reported in the Wall Street Journal. Google has since disabled the code, and claims that the report is in error, and that its cookies only collected anonymous information. The revelation caused outcry among online privacy advocates. San Francisco's Electronic Frontier Foundation says, 'Coming on the heels of Google's controversial decision to tear down the privacy-protective walls between some of its other services, this is bad news for the company. 'It's time for Google to acknowledge that it can do a better job of respecting the privacy of Web users.' Apple iPhone 4S: The smartphone's Safari browser is the most popular mobile web browser . Google says that the report was in error. 'The Journal mischaracterizes what happened and why,' says a spokesperson. 'We used known Safari functionality to provide features that signed-in Google users had enabled. It’s important to stress that these advertising cookies do not collect personal information.' 'Unlike other major browsers, Apple’s Safari browser blocks third-party cookies by default,' says the spokesperson. 'However, Safari enables many web features for its users that rely on third parties and third-party cookies, such as 'Like' buttons.  Last year, we began using this functionality to enable features for signed-in Google users on Safari. 'To enable these features, we created a temporary communication link between Safari browsers and Google’s servers, so that we could ascertain whether Safari users were also signed into Google, and had opted for this type of personalisation. 'However, the Safari browser contained functionality that then enabled other Google advertising cookies to be set on the browser.  We didn’t anticipate that this would happen, and we have now started removing these advertising cookies from Safari browsers.' European regulators recently wrote to Google CEO Larry Page calling on the search giant to halt the introduction of its new privacy policy. It was due to come into effect on March 1, and would allow Google to share what it knows about users between services such as Google Search, Gmail and YouTube. The move horrified privacy advocates and bloggers - tech site ZDNet said that Google would 'know more about you than your wife does' and said the policy was 'Big Brother-ish'. The European Union working party asked for Google to stop the new policy while the working group investigate whether personal data is protected. ‘We call for a pause to ensure that there can be no misunderstanding about Google’s commitments to information rights of EU citizens.’ ‘Given the wide range of services you offer, and the popularity of these services, changes in your privacy policy may affect many citizens in most  EU member states,’ the group wrote to Google Chief Executive Larry Page. Mr Hachamovitch says Internet Explorer 9 has an additional privacy feature called Tracking Protection which will protect users from Google’s prying.",Accusation comes after Google reportedly bypassed Apple Safari privacy settings .

Twenty years on: Denise Fergus has said life is still a struggle following the death of her son James Bulger . The mother of James Bulger is to appear in person at the parole hearing for one of her son’s killers for the first time to plead that he is not released. Denise Fergus said her message will be that Jon Venables ‘is still a danger’. Venables has been freed before but was locked up again after being caught with child pornography. ‘He was given a second chance and blew it,’ said Mrs Fergus ahead of the 20th anniversary of James’s killing tomorrow. ‘The images he had on his computer were disgusting and I strongly believe he should not be released.’ Venables and his friend Robert Thompson were ten when they abducted, tortured and murdered two-year-old James in 1993. They were detained for a minimum of eight years and released with new identities in 2001, but Venables was jailed in 2010 after being caught with child pornography on his laptop. He has served his sentence and a parole hearing is scheduled to take place within the next couple of months to see whether he should be released. Mrs Fergus, 45, said she will be submitting evidence, gathered with the help of her solicitor, that Venables is an ‘undiagnosed psychopath’ who should not be held in a mainstream prison but treated in a psychiatric hospital. ‘People say children aren’t born evil, but I believe Venables was,’ she added. ‘He proved that after he was released with everything that was found on his computer – sick images of children as young as two. To kill a child and have those images, he can’t be right in the head.’ Mrs Fergus, of Kirkby, Merseyside, said the parole board had a duty to consider evidence, gathered by the police at the time of James’s murder but never presented to the jury at the trial, which suggested her son had been sexually assaulted before he died.

He behaved like an ‘angel’, buying her flowers every week and taking her away for romantic trips by the sea. Within months he had proposed, saying he was madly in love with her. In fact, McMaster was a conman. The 64-year-old, who pretended to be a retired police officer, was busy plundering her savings – and those of another woman, to whom he was engaged at the same time. Divorcee Jean Antrobus, pictured left, was one of the two women targeted by conman Derek McMaster, right . Mrs Antrobus, also 64, found out that she had been robbed of more than £5,000 only after her credit card was rejected when she went to pay for a private operation. Police were called and they discovered that McMaster was living a double life. Yesterday he was facing jail after he admitted stealing from the two women. Mrs Antrobus, a mother of two, said: ‘I feel really hurt and betrayed. I trusted him, but he used me and broke my heart. He’s a terrible conman.’ McMaster, a former lorry driver, was due to stand trial, but pleaded guilty to two charges of theft during a hearing at Warrington Crown Court. Mrs Antrobus, of Runcorn, Cheshire, said she had been completely ‘charmed’ by McMaster after they met through a lonely hearts advert about a year ago. The former shop worker said yesterday: ‘I had been married for 38 years. I’d never answered a lonely hearts advert in my  life before, but I was feeling a bit fed up so I decided to ring the number. Elaborate: Warrington Crown Court (pictured) found that McMaster's victims did not know they were being two-timed until they arrived to give evidence . ‘He was an angel at first, he bought me bouquets of flowers every week and took me away for weekends, a real gentleman. ‘He said, “Let’s get married. I never loved anyone like you”. He was convincing and I loved him, but now I realise I was paying for it all along.’ Last June the couple held  a big engagement party, but  by that time McMaster had already been stealing from her on a regular basis. ‘He said he was a retired police officer and worked part time,’ she added. ‘He had a full uniform and handcuffs and used to come home with tales of how he had arrested drug users, but now I know he had simply bought the outfit over the internet.’ She discovered the truth last August, when she went to have private corrective surgery on her jaw and her credit card was rejected at the hospital. In total, McMaster stole £5,224 from her between March and June last year. Police discovered he was also engaged to 63-year-old Margaret Dickenson, who is a kidney dialysis patient. She had been conned out of £1,350. McMaster took both women’s credit cards without their knowledge, and asked them  for their PINs so he could buy their shopping. Mrs Antrobus said: ‘When I realised he had been seeing the other lady, I realised he was leading two separate lives. It was like kicking me in the ribs. I’ve never been so shocked in all my life.’ Judge David Hale told McMaster, of Liverpool, to expect jail when he is sentenced later this month.","Derek McMaster faces jail after stealing £6,500 from them in elaborate scam .

Ray of hope: The tree was smuggled into the WWII camp in a food parcel and brought Christmas cheer to prisoners of war at Stalag 11A . Mr Kent, then 19, had been incarcerated by Hitler’s regime three months earlier while fighting against the Germans in the Warsaw Uprising. The tree was the last gift he received from his parents, who he would not see for another 15 years. Mr Kent, now 87 and living in Wivelsfield Green, near Haywards Heath, East Sussex, took the tree with him when he and 75,000 other prisoners at the camp, close to Moosburg, southern Germany, were liberated four months later. He has treasured it for the past 68 years, lighting it every Christmas as a reminder of the hope it brought him during his internment. ‘We had been forbidden Christmas trees, even though we were surrounded by them in a beautiful pine forest, but when I received this little collapsible tree from my parents in Poland, I decided I just had to share it,’ Mr Kent, a retired architect, said. ‘My heart was so full, because here was a link with home, where every year we had a tree. ‘It . was a frosty night, and within minutes hundreds of prisoners who saw . the candles in the window had gathered outside in the snow. They came . from all over the world, and started singing Silent Night and other . carols in all their different languages, some wiping tears from their . eyes. ‘We had practically . nothing to eat - just watery soup the Germans gave us - but we had . survived - and to us it felt like Christmas.’ Memories: Mr Janusz, pictured in his home in East Sussex and aged 17, lights the Christmas tree every year . After the camp was liberated by Allied forces in April 1945, Mr Kent, who had badly injured his right arm during the uprising, was sent to Brussels and later England for treatment. He arrived in the UK on a stretcher with a bag containing just a toothbrush, a scrap of soap and his tiny, treasured tree. He spent three years in an orthopaedic hospital in Mansfield, where he studied for an architecture degree, and later moved to Wivelsfield Green to work on the expansion of Gatwick Airport. ‘The tree was the last thing I had from my parents, whom I would not see again for 15 years,’ said Mr Kent, who was later decorated by the British for his war heroics. ‘I joined the Polish resistance at 14, helped blow up bridges and planes and fought for five years before I was wounded and captured in the Warsaw Uprising. ‘Thankfully, my parents survived and so did my sister, who was in another prison camp, though it would be years before we would all find each other and manage to be reunited. ‘I studied for my architect’s degree during the three years I was an inmate at the orthopaedic hospital in Mansfield where my arm was saved. I was very fortunate in having the services of Ian Campbell, personal surgeon to King George VI.’ Mr Kent met and married a British woman, with whom he had two daughters, before divorcing. He met his second wife, Halina, 81, a Pole who also fled her home country after the war, in the early 1960s. The couple have a daughter and three grandchildren and will celebrate their golden wedding anniversary next year. The tree is so important to them that this year they decided to include it on their Christmas card to family and friends. ‘Every year, when we light the tree we feel so close together, so lucky that we have each other, that Janusz survived all those horrible years, and it makes Christmas come alive for us,’ Mrs Kent said. ‘The tree has seen better times, having survived a fire and other mishaps, but every year it makes us both feel grateful we have had such a beautiful life together.’","Polish POW was sent the tree whilst in German camp in 1944 .

Fashion designer Alfred Fiandaca - who was responsible for many of Ann Romney's campaign trail looks - has passed away at 72 . The fashion designer responsible for many of Ann Romney’s campaign outfits has passed away at the age of 72. Alfred Fiandaca - whose designs were favored by Mrs Romney during the 2012 Presidential race - died Saturday of a major stroke in West Palm Beach, Florida. Fiandaca divided his time between Boston, New York and Palm Beach, and is survived by his daughter, son and spouse, Carl Bartels. After founding his eponymous line in 1960, the designer opened up his first shop in Boston, Massachusetts. His tailored skirt suits and elegant dresses soon attracted the attention of political figures in Washington, among them Joan Kennedy and Lady Bird Johnson. Actresses Julie Andrews and Audrey Hepburn also wore his creations. Mrs Romney, 63, had been a supporter of his ever since her husband Mitt was governor of Massachusetts. On the campaign trail, relatively unknown Fiandaca earned recognition for being the go-to designer for the Republican candidate's wife. Mrs Romney wore a crisp cream-colored skirt suit from his fall 2006 collection to the first presidential debate. Mitt Romney's wife Ann (pictured at the first Presidential debate in October) was a fan and friend of Fiandaca, and wore many of his designs on the campaign trail - including this cream skirt suit . The former Republican candidate's wife wore the fashion veteran's pink skirt suit (left) on the campaign trail and black leather ensemble (right) on the Jay Leno show . And the edgy black leather skirt suit she sported on the Jay Leno show was also one of his creations. Although Fiandaca was a Democrat, he . had no qualms about dressing the wife of the former Republican hopeful, . both of whom he counted as friends. In an interview with New York Magazine . last year, the fashion designer's rep described him as 'apolitical', . noting that he had dressed just as many Democrats as Republicans. His designs are sold in boutiques in Boston and Palm Beach, as well as an atelier in Manhattan's Garment District. Fiandaca was known among friends and in social circles in New York and Palm Beach for his outgoing and friendly demeanor. A third-generation member of the garment trade, the fashion veteran began cutting clothes when he was only nine. His glamorous designs have earned him recognition in the art world as well as the fashion world.

The SAS hero jailed for keeping a pistol as a war trophy was part of a crack counter-terrorism unit known as the ‘Wheel of Death’, ordered by David Cameron to protect Britain from a Mumbai-style terrorist attack. Sgt Danny Nightingale, 37, led a sniper team that was on 30-minute emergency standby at the height of a scare involving a plot to shoot civilians on the streets of a British city. The specialist helicopter squad was briefed about its role after a meeting of the Government’s emergency committee, Cobra, chaired by the Prime Minister, in the summer of 2010. According to court papers seen by The Mail on Sunday, Sgt Nightingale was the ‘sniper co-ordinator of a fast-reaction counter-terrorism team’. It was described as the ‘Wheel of Death’ because of its high-stress combat role, rotating the SAS soldiers between counter-terrorism assignments and tours in Afghanistan and Somalia. Sgt Nightingale’s supporters believe the non-commissioned officer, who served with valour in Iraq and Afghanistan, should never have been brought to trial after police found a pistol and ammunition in his Army accommodation. His wife Sally, 38, with whom he  has two young children, has written to Mr Cameron asking him to intervene in the case. Downing Street sources say the Prime Minister sympathises with the soldier’s predicament. This week his lawyers will ask the Court of Appeal to lift his ‘manifestly excessive’ 18-month prison sentence. While in Iraq, Sgt Nightingale helped train a group of Iraqi special forces known as ‘the Apostles’, who presented him with a 9mm Glock pistol in recognition of his service. Elite: Snipers similar to Sgt Nightingale's SAS team that was on 30-minute emergency standby at the height of a scare involving a plot to kill British civilians . Sgt Nightingale's supporters beleive he should never have been brought to trial after police found a pistol in his accommodation . He intended to have the weapon deactivated and presented to the regimental sergeants’ mess as a war trophy. But . in November 2007, two members of his squadron were killed. Sgt . Nightingale returned to the UK with the bodies of his friends after . volunteering to help the bereaved families, while his equipment, . including the pistol, was packed into a security box and returned to SAS . headquarters in Hereford. This box was held in a secure cage at the Hereford base where Sgt Nightingale was stationed. In the summer of 2010, British intelligence received warnings of a Mumbai-style terror plot against Britain, similar to the 2008 atrocity in India in which 174 people were killed during a 24-hour attack by ten gunmen. Sgt Nightingale was assigned as a co-ordinator of the sniper team. It was during his time with the unit that he was granted permission for a two-hour break to move his belongings from the box to his accommodation. This is when he is believed to have brought the pistol into an unsecured location, contrary to regulations. His court martial was told: ‘It is extremely stressful, and it is hardly surprising... that you might not remember that you had in your possession this Glock gun.’ Next week SAS officers will give evidence in support of a reduction in Sgt Nightingale’s sentence. His legal team will be led by William Clegg QC, who represented Barry George, wrongly accused of murdering Jill Dando.","Sgt Danny Nightingale was jailed for keeping a pistol as a war trophy .

The . cash, funded through Foreign Office handouts and EU grants, has . financed a range of human rights reforms to try to bring one of .

But last week Qatada’s deportation . was blocked after a court ruled there was a real risk that evidence . obtained through torture might be used against him. The controversial cleric must stay in London with his family under house arrest. Britain’s security services still regard him as capable of supporting Al Qaeda terror operations in the UK. The . £10million handouts are on top of the £3million legal bill for Qatada’s . failed deportation and the on-going £5million-a-year cost of keeping . him in the UK. But . despite millions of pounds of British taxpayers’ money and the . Government’s frustration, Jordan is still not a fit country to receive . Muslim terror suspects. Last . year the Foreign Office spent a record £1.5million directly from . Treasury coffers to help pay for a justice system free from the risk of . torture and other human rights abuses. And since 2008, Britain has contributed £4.26million to an EU human rights aid budget for Jordan. This year the EU pledged £3.8million from the UK contribution to improve human rights and democracy in Jordan. Among . the projects part paid for by UK taxpayers is a human rights centre in .

This . week, nearly ten years after Britain first began the process of . deporting Qatada, Home Office officials were dispatched to Jordan once . again to try to resolve the human rights issue.

Tougher rules: David Cameron, speaking at the headquarters of B&Q in Eastleigh, Hampshire, said he wanted tougher rules to ensure visitors to the UK do not 'take advantage' of public services . David Cameron signalled a crackdown on foreigners using public services yesterday, saying Britain should not be a ‘soft touch’ for welfare tourists. The Prime Minister, who wants tougher rules to ensure visitors do not ‘take advantage’ of British generosity, said those from outside the EU should pay when they use our hospitals. Officials should also do more to reclaim the costs of NHS treatment from EU countries whose nationals take ill here. Mr Cameron confirmed he has asked officials to draw up plans to withhold welfare payments, housing benefit and legal aid from Romanians and Bulgarians expected to flock to the UK in January when restrictions on their travel here are lifted. He spoke out during his first campaign visit to Eastleigh, where the Tories are locked in a by-election battle with their Liberal Democrat Coalition partners after the resignation of disgraced MP Chris Huhne. Speaking at the headquarters of the DIY retailer B&Q, Mr Cameron told voters: ‘There’s a lot more to do to make sure we are not a soft touch and while we are a welcoming, open country, we don’t allow people to come here to take advantage of us, which happens too often today. ‘We are not tough enough about people coming from the other side of the world who decide to use our health service. They have not contributed through their taxes... When people come from outside the EU, they should pay for the NHS. ‘Within the EU, there are forms you have to fill in to make sure you get access to healthcare, but we haven’t been very good at charging back and getting the money for the work we carry out, so we need to do that better. Recoup the costs: Mr Cameron told the audience that officials should do more to reclaim the costs of NHS treatment from EU countries whose nationals take ill here . Immigration minister Mark Harper revealed last night that to prevent welfare tourism, the Government is considering forcing Romanians, Bulgarians and other EU nationals to register for residency permits if they intend to stay in the UK longer than three months. He told ITV News: ‘One of the things we’re looking at – other European countries do it – is insist that people register. Tightening the belt: The Prime Minister said he has asked officials to draw up plans to withhold benefits from Romanians and Bulgarians expected to flock to the UK next year when travel restrictions are lifted . ‘If you look at other countries, they have a mandatory registration for all citizens from all other EU countries. 'Before they can access services, they insist on them registering. We’re looking to see what the costs will be, what the benefits will be.’ In a clear admission the Government has no idea how many Romanians and Bulgarians will come to the UK next year, Mr Harper confirmed ministers have not sought to publish an estimate because the range of possibilities is too wide. On Tuesday Mr Cameron chaired a cabinet sub-committee of ministers who have been asked to find ways of reducing the UK’s ‘pull factors’ for immigrants. Yesterday he said he had set up a unit to look at ‘all benefits people can get from coming here and asking whether it’s fair’. The group is examining whether the UK can restrict benefits for migrants from Romania and Bulgaria when travel restrictions are lifted in January. But last night EU Commissioner Viviane Reding said they must be treated the same way as citizens of other member states who have the right to work and settle in the UK. During his visit to Eastleigh, Mr Cameron took a pot shot at the Lib Dems, reminding voters the by-election was called because Huhne has pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice.","PM wants tougher rules to ensure visitors do not 'take advantage'

President Francois Hollande has promised French help to Mali after an appeal from the West African nation for international help to counter an offensive by al-Qaeda-linked militants. The French president said today that the country would not accept the ‘blatant aggression that is threatening Mali's very existence.’ Mali's government appealed for urgent military aid from France on Thursday after Islamist fighters controlling large areas in the north encroached further south, seizing the town of Konna in the centre of the country. Promising help: French president Francois Hollande said he would not accept the 'blatant aggression that is threatening Mali's very existence' ‘France cannot accept this,’ President . Hollande said in a speech today. ‘We will be ready to stop the . terrorists' offensive if it continues.’ Hollande said that France, alongside African partners, would respond to Mali's request for military aid within the framework of U.N. Security Council resolutions. French diplomatic sources said existing U.N. resolutions would permit a French military intervention in Mali, if needed. Western powers are worried the alliance of al Qaeda-linked militants that seized the northern two-thirds of Mali in April will seek to use the vast desert zone as a launchpad for international attacks. ‘The French believe that France, and Europe, face a real security threat from what is happening in the Sahel,’ said Jakkie Cilliers, executive director of the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa, adding that if Hollande does send military aid they will seek to make it ‘as short, sharp and contained as possible’. Military aid: President Hollande promised French help, with a possible military intervention within U.N. frameworks, as EU prepare to send a team of 200 to train the Malian army . In turn the European Union will speed up . preparations to send a team to Mali to train the country's army, EU . foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said today. The rebel attacks have underlined the need for ‘enhanced and accelerated international engagement’ to help restore state authority throughout Mali, Ashton said. The EU was due to send 200 trainers to Mali in late February or early March but this will not happen sooner. ‘The European Union will accelerate preparations for the deployment of a military mission to Mali to provide training and advice to the Malian forces,’ she said in a statement. Coup: Renegade Malian soldiers appearing on television last spring after they seized power in protest at the government's failure stop the Islamist rebels, an action which only led to further rebel power . The European Union would look at targeted sanctions against all groups affiliated to militant organisations ‘if need be’, Ashton said. More than two decades worth of peaceful elections had earned the Mali a reputation as a bulwark of democracy in a part of Africa better known for turmoil - an image that unraveled in a matter of weeks after a coup last March that paved the way for the Islamist rebellion. Mali is Africa's third largest gold producer and a major cotton grower, and home to the fabled northern desert city of Timbuktu - an ancient trading hub and UNESCO World Heritage site that hosted annual music festivals before the rebellion.","President Francois Hollande promised help to Mali in speech today .

A British man controversially stripped of his citizenship last year by the Home Secretary has spent three months being interrogated by US agents in an African prison. Mahdi Hashi, 23, from London, who vanished last summer in Somalia, turned up in a New York courtroom just before Christmas, charged with terrorism offences. His sudden appearance in America five months after his family had reported him missing has prompted claims that he is the victim of international kidnap or ‘rendition’. Charged: Mahdi Hashi, 23, from London, who . vanished last summer in Somalia, turned up in a New York courtroom just . before Christmas, charged with terrorism offences . Now it has emerged that between August and the middle of November he was being questioned by teams of agents from the CIA and FBI while being held by the secret intelligence service of Djibouti, a small African state that borders Somalia. The former care worker lost contact with his family while staying in Somalia last year. When they began looking for him, they were told by Foreign Office officials that the British Government could not provide assistance because the Home Secretary Theresa May had issued an order depriving him of his UK citizenship over allegations of Islamic extremism. A Mail on Sunday report after Hashi, who came to Britain from Somalia when he was five, appeared in court . A few weeks later he was detained by Djibouti’s secret police, who it is claimed raided a house in which he was staying in the capital, Djibouti City. A source close to the case said Mr Hashi was taken to the intelligence service headquarters, where he spent nearly four months before being sent to America for trial. ‘He was sojourning in Djibouti when he was picked up by Djibouti’s secret intelligence officers and thrown in a cell in solitary confinement,’ said the source. ‘Soon after he was visited and interrogated by FBI officers and then later by the CIA.’ The American interrogations were continuous and all the time  the Djibouti security officers were present, said the source. ‘It was as  if they were telling him that if he didn’t fully co-operate with the Americans, he would be left to  the special interrogation skills of the Djiboutis,’ the source added. On November 15, he was shackled and put on a plane for the US. His case has been picked up by the US media as evidence of President Obama’s new rendition programme, where suspects who are deemed to pose a threat to the country are secretly held in African states allied to America. Mr Hashi, who came to Britain from Somalia when he was five, is accused of working with the terrorist group al-Shabaab, which is at war with the government of Somalia. If convicted, he faces a life sentence. His family deny that he has ever been involved in terrorist activities and say he was planning to return to London to complete his education. He left Britain in 2009, firstly for Somalia where he married a local woman. He has a grandmother in Djibouti. Mr Hashi is now being held in solitary confinement in  a top-security prison in New York. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Mahdi Hashi, who .

Shaking hands when meeting someone new or giving a high five to a friend are things most people take for granted. But for 29-year-old double hand transplant patient, Lindsay Ess, being able to do these simple acts means the world. The Texas fashion graduate lost both hands and feet five years ago, when a blockage in her small intestine resulting from Crohn's Disease led to an infection that turned her extremities into dead tissue. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Happy hands: Texas fashion graduate Lindsay Ess, pictured, lost her hands and her feet five years ago but after has a new lease on life after a double hand transplant . 'I would look down and I would see black, almost like a body that had decomposed,' she told ABC's Nightline in a program due to air tonight. She knew things were bad, but hadn't processed quite how bad. 'There was a period of time where they didn't tell me that they had to amputate, but somebody from the staff said, ""Oh honey, you know what they are going to do to your hands, right?"" That's when I knew,' she said. Without her hands and feet, Ess had to adapt. She learned how to brush her teeth, do her make up and drink from a cup using just her arms, which were amputated just below the elbow. She even taught herself how to text on her cellphone without fingers. Ess got fitted with prosthetic legs and accepted that getting new feet was probably an unrealistic goal. But living the rest of her life without hands wasn't an option, particularly as she complained that her prosthetic arms were too heavy, having been designed for men. 'I've accepted the fact that my feet are gone, that's acceptable to me,' she said. 'My hands (are) not. It's still not. In my dreams I always have my hands.' Donor: Nearly 18 months ago, Ess, pictured in hospital, got the call that a donor had been found that would give her hands and forearms again . Adjusting: The skin color of her new hands and arms isn't exactly the same as her upper arms and the fact they still looked like they belonged to someone else was hard for Ess, pictured, to accept at first . For the next couple of years, Ess exercised diligently - something she needed to do to qualify for a hand transplant. She also had to wait for a donor, preferably a woman who had similar sized hands and skin color to her. The waiting was the hardest part, she told ABC. 'I hate thinking about that,' she said. 'I think that whoever's hands will be with purpose, not just used to look pretty.' The surgery took nearly 12 hours, as two separate teams of doctors, one dedicated to the left hand, the other to the right, worked to perform an operation that surgeons have only attempted about 60 times in the past 15 years. Ess woke from the surgery in a cocoon of bandages. Levin told ABC that the initial signs that the donor's hands would take were good. 'This is more than we could ever hope for,' he said. 'Her blood pressure is good, all the parameters related to how to blood flow in and out of her new arms. This is, if you will, a picture perfect course so far.' Before: Ess, pictured, suffered a major sepsis infection following intestinal surgery because of Crohn's disease, which required doctors to amputate her arms below the elbows and her legs below her knees . No hands: Without her hands, Ess had to adapt, learning how to drink from a cup, brush her teeth and apply makeup, pictured, with her arms . Ess was out of the ICU and working on a therapy regime less than a month after surgery. The skin color of her new hands and arms wasn't exactly the same as her upper arms and the fact they still looked like they belonged to someone else was hard for Ess to accept. 'The first couple of days I refused to look at them,' she said. 'It was kind of like one of those scary movie moments. I'm too scared to look because it's reality (but) I'm so grateful to have them that I just don't really think about it superficially.' Four months after her surgery, in January 2012, Ess continued to amaze doctors with her recovery. She wasn't expected to have fine motion control for another year or 18 months, but her muscles were reacting well and she could even pick up small objects with her new hands. Even so, there was still a huge concern the transplant wouldn't take. Surgery: The cutting-edge surgery, pictured, took two teams of doctors 12 hours to complete . 'In Lindsay's case, the hookup of the new hand is relying on her nerves growing into the new muscles from the donor,' Levin told Nightline. 'The nerves have to grow into those muscles, takes months, it can take a year... Failure means the part that doesn't survive and we have to re-amputate the transplant. That's failure.' But Levin doesn't think that will happen for Ess. He says her prognosis for both hands couldn't be better. Ess, who was always one of the pretty girls, says the whole experience has taught her a lesson about what's important in life. 'People used to turn and look at me when I walked down the street because of how beautiful I was,' she told ABC. 'Now they turn and look at me because I'm in a wheelchair. 'The type of person that I was would be the type of person I would hate now. I used to care way too much about what I looked like. What does it matter what my hair looks like? What does it matter what I'm wearing so much?' She added to WTVR.com: 'I can sense the donor. I have a great sense of appreciation.'","Lindsay Ess, 29, received double hand transplant last year .

Jonathan James, 10, was forced to stand on an X drawn on the kitchen floor while sun beat down on him through a window in 100 degree heat, a court in Texas, Dallas heard. His step-mother Tina Marie Alberson, 44, is on trial accused of a first-degree felony charge of injury to a child. If convicted, she faces up to life in prison. She alleged to have taken part in what prosecutors said was 'torture' of the boy at their home in Duncanville. The victim's father Michael Ray James,43, goes on trial next month on the same charge. An emergency room doctor testified that the boy went into cardiac arrest, had multiple organs failure, blood poisoning and muscle breakdown as a result of being deprived of water. Doctors tried desperately to resuscitate him for about two hours, but were unable to save him. 'He was dead when he arrived. We were able to get his heart restarted, but even in the time period that we were able to get his heart restarted it would have been considered a comatose state. 'He was completely unresponsive and unable to communicate with us,' said Dr. David Bryce from Charlton Methodist Hospital. He said not a drop of urine was found in the Jonathan's bladder, which doctors said was significant because it meant he was markedly dehydrated. Throughout his ordeal there was no air conditioning in their Duncanville house, prosecutors said. Jonathan's twin brother, Joseph, is expected to testify in the trial. He said in an interview after the arrests of his father and stepmother that Jonathan was put in a room without air conditioning and was told to stand by the window as the sun beat down on him.

In an interview shortly after the arrests, Jonathan's grandmother Sue Shotwell said Jonathan had called her in late June 2011 and said he was afraid to live with his father and stepmother for a month long court-ordered custody visit. 'This was an intentional act of torture of a child by the people who he trusts and confides in the most, his parents,' former Dallas police Deputy Chief Craig Miller, who supervised the investigation, said in an interview with the Dallas Morning News.

Disgraced police chief Ali Dizaei yesterday lost his appeal against his convictions for framing an innocent man for assault. The 50-year-old former Scotland Yard commander had tried to get his three-year prison sentence for corruption overturned by claiming he was the ‘victim of a sophisticated witch-hunt’. But three judges at the Court of Appeal unanimously upheld a jury’s decision last year that Dizaei had framed an innocent man, Waad al-Baghdadi, in a row over money. Former Metropolitan Police Commander Ali Dizaei with his wife at Southwark Crown Court on Wednesday, where he had tried to appeal his three year prison sentence . His disgraceful behaviour has been repeatedly exposed by the Mail which, since 2001, has chronicled how timid Scotland Yard chiefs appeased his appalling behaviour, endless threats of legal action and even strikes by fellow race militants. At one stage, Dizaei was considered more powerful than the Metropolitan Police Commissioner - such was the stranglehold he held over his supposed superiors. The swaggering playboy, who loved to play the race card to intimidate critics, has been tried and convicted twice over the charges. Dizaei, dubbed a ‘criminal in uniform’, was first found guilty in February 2010 after a jury decided that he was lying when he claimed Mr al-Baghdadi had threatened him and assaulted him outside a west London restaurant in July 2008. But he was freed from prison, where he was serving a four year sentence, in May 2011 after the Court of Appeal quashed the convictions because his victim had failed to tell the truth about his immigration status. Ali Dizaei had claimed that he was threatened and assaulted by Waad al-Baghdadi in a row over money, but a jury decided he was lying . At a retrial at Southwark Crown Court last year the officer was once again found guilty of misconduct and perverting the course of justice. He was then jailed for three years, but released on an electronic tag two weeks later because he had spent 15 months in prison as a result of his first conviction. In the latest appeal, Dizaei’s lawyer, Stephen Riordan, QC, argued that the conviction was ‘unsafe’. He said that the judge at the second trial had made an ‘error of law’ when he refused to admit certain ‘bad character’ evidence relating to Mr al-Baghdadi. Mr Riordan argued that because of the judge’s decision to reject the application the jury ‘did not have all the material that it should have done’. He told the court: ‘We submit simply that that decision was wrong - that the reasons he gave for refusing to allow this material to be deployed were matters which more properly should have been considered by the jury.’ Opposing the appeal, Peter Wright, QC, for the Crown, told the court: ‘Here there was no error by the judge in the exercise he undertook. The decision was not wrong in law.’ A jury decided that Waad Al-Baghdadi, pictured, had been framed by Ali Dizaei after a row outside a West London restaurant . Mr Wright said: ‘We submit that in the context of the fairness of this trial, that this trial remained entirely fair and that the conviction was not unsafe.’ Dismissing the appeal, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, sitting with Mr Justice Wyn Williams and Mr Justice Globe, ruled that the conviction was ‘safe’. Lord Judge added: ‘In truth there was formidable evidence against the appellant.’ Prior to being jailed for a second time, Dizaei was on full pay. After winning a retrial but still to clear his name, he was reinstated, quickly suspended on full pay and then awarded up to £180,000 in back pay and allowances as he awaited the new hearing. His salary was stopped on the day he was convicted again. Dizaei, of Acton, west London, has emerged unscathed from a series of inquiries over the years which cost Scotland Yard around £4million. One included an undercover operation examining claims of corruption, fraud, dishonesty and appalling threats to an ex-girlfriend.","Former Metropolitan Police commander Ali Dizaei lost his appeal against his corruption charge .

Illegitimate: Eric Daniels, former chief executive of Lloyds, told the banking commission of MPs and peers, said that up to half claims for compensation over mis-selling of PPI were 'illegitimate' Disgraced former Lloyds boss Eric Daniels yesterday launched an astonishing attack on the bank’s customers, blaming bogus PPI claims for pushing up the compensation bill. Daniels – who is widely blamed for steering Lloyds to the brink of collapse in 2008 – said up to half of claims on payment protection insurance policies were ‘completely illegitimate’. In a rare public appearance since retiring from the bailed-out bank almost two years ago, the American told the banking commission of MPs and peers he was ‘deeply regretful’ about customers  who were genuine victims of mis-selling, but blamed dishonest claimants for pushing up the compensation bill. And he offered no apology for the debacle, claiming PPI was ‘good value for money’. He said: ‘In the great majority of cases customers received a good sales process, and received a product that suited them.’ And echoing the notorious boast from Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein that bankers do ‘God’s work’, Daniels insisted Lloyds ‘was on the side of the angels’ and abided by the City watchdog’s rules. Daniels’ version of events was dismissed last night by the Financial Ombudsman, which pointed out that almost three-quarters of PPI complaints it receives about Lloyds TSB are upheld in the customer’s favour. The ombudsman said last October that bankers’ complaints about bogus claims should be treated with ‘cynicism’. Lloyds has set aside £5.3billion so far to pay compensation to those who were mis-sold PPI – far more than any other bank – and is expected to earmark even more money for payouts when it announces its latest financial results on March 1. By the book: The American insisted Lloyds ¿was on the side of the angels¿ and abided by the City watchdog¿s rules . More than £13billion in total has been set aside by the country’s lenders. Yet banks are still refusing to settle thousands of customers’ PPI disputes – and as a result, subsequent complaints to the banking watchdog have soared to unprecedented levels. The Financial Ombudsman Service is now being swamped by 15,000 bank complaints a week, most of which are about PPI and two thirds of which are upheld. Banks have consistently accused the Financial Services Authority of introducing tougher regulations on PPI and applying them to past sales. No apology: Mr Daniels offered no apology for the debacle, claiming PPI was ¿good value for money¿ . Yesterday Daniels insisted the huge bill for mis-sold PPI that built up after he retired in 2011 was partly the result of a ‘misunderstanding’. ‘We thought we were on the side of the angels,’ he said. ‘I believe the vast majority of the provision is due to a difference in understanding between the industry and regulator.’ Dr Ros Altmann, a former Downing Street adviser, said: ‘These comments are extremely worrying as they suggest lessons still haven’t been learned.’","Eric Daniels said that up to half of PPI claims were 'completely illegitimate'

The 76-year-old politician - who is seeking a return to power at the end of the month - can be seen grinning from ear to ear as his 27-year-old partner Francesca Pascale kisses him on the cheek. The pair - who have an age gap close to 50 years - were pictured enjoying a pre-Valentine's day meal at the exclusive Capricci Sicilliani restaurant in Rome last night. Cat that got the cream: Silvio Berlusconi grins from ear to ear as his young fiancee Francesca Pascale kisses his cheek during a romantic dinner at the Capricci Sicilliani restaurant in Rome . Age gap: Silvio Berlusconi, at 76, is nearly 50 years older than his 27-year-old partner Francesca Pascale . It comes as polls suggest Berlusconi returning to power won't happen, despite his party's revival from near-death last year. The most probable outcome remains a victory of the centre-left coalition led by Pier Luigi Bersani's Democratic Party (PD) in the lower house. But Berlusconi and his future wife - who is nearly a third his age - looked far from worried last night. Ms Pascale - a member of Berlusconi's People of Liberty party - can be seen whispering into the former Italian Prime Minister's ear and nuzzling his next. Wedding bells: Berlusconi announced that he got engaged to Miss Pascale - a member of his People of Liberty party - in December . Optimistic: The couple were enjoying a pre-Valentine's Day meal despite Berlusconi's party being down in the polls . The couple appear to be eating a meal with friends but don't let that stop them from performing some very public displays of affection. Miss Pascale, a former shop assistant from Naples, served as a provincial councillor in his centre-Right PDL party before stepping down in July. A founding member of a support group called 'Silvio, we miss you', she has previously said the three most important things in her life are her family, politics and Mr Berlusconi. Tactile: The couple appeared to be dining with friends but didn't let that stop them from making public displays of affection . Number one fan: Miss Pascale founded a fan group for Berlusconi called 'Silvio, we miss you' It is said she is jealous of the other women in his inner circle, including a glamour model Mara Carfagna whom he appointed equal opportunities minister during his last term as Prime Minister. The billionaire confirmed their relationship on television, calling her 'beautiful on the inside and the outside'. 'Finally I feel less lonely,' Mr Berlusconi said. 'I am engaged to a Neapolitan, it’s official.' Berlusconi has been married twice and has five children. In 1965, he married Carla Elvira Dall'Oglio, and they had two children. He later had three more children with his second wife, the actress Veronica Lario, from whom he is separated. Next First Lady? Silvio Berlusconi is making another bid for power in Italian elections being held at the end of the month . Joint cause: Miss Pascale served as a provincial councillor in the PDL party before stepping down last July .

Berlusconi has since been ordered to pay Lario £29 million a year in a divorce settlement - which works out as £82,000 a day. That's four times the average annual salary for an ordinary Italian but small change to Mr Berlusconi, who has a personal fortune of more than £5 billion. Over the years, Mr Berlusconi has been linked with a string of glamorous young women, including models, actors, showgirls and prostitutes who attended his notorious 'bunga bunga' sex parties at his mansions.

A former City trader dubbed the Bernie Madoff of Frinton-on-Sea has been warned to expect a long jail sentence after admitting conning wealthy friends and colleagues out of more than £3 million with get-even-richer-quick schemes. Ian Dickinson, 49, conned his wealthy friends out of millions by new investors’ cash to give the impression of a successful money-making business. The con netted Dickinson more than £3.3 million - helping him to fund his lavish lifestyle which included a £500,000 home in Frinton-on-Sea, Essex. The conman yesterday appeared in the dock at Chelmsford Crown Court where he admitted two counts of fraud and was told to expect a lengthy jail sentence. Judge Anthony Goldstaub QC told him: 'You are facing a long prison sentence - custody is inevitable.' Dickinson conned millions out of investors after claiming he could make them quick returns on foreign exchange deals through his company FX Trading. The fraudster targeted friends, family and wealthy clubmates who he impressed with immediate returns on their early investments. The con - known as a Ponzi scheme - used new traders’ investments to pay false returns to current investors. Trusting members of Frinton Golf Club, Frinton Lawn Tennis Club and Frinton Rotary Club pumped thousands of pounds into the scheme which took place between January 2007 and November 2010. Lawn tennis club chairman Roger Evans said: 'It is a sad day to see anybody let themselves down so badly, but that’s the way things are. 'We are all sad to see it happen and we hope that once he has paid his penalty, we can all find a way to move on. Fricton-on-Sea: Ian Dickinson targeted wealthy residents in Frinton-on-Sea, Essex, by offering get-even-richer-quick schemes . 'It is a very sensitive situation and obviously impacts at the heart of the community.' He was previously regarded as a pillar of the community in the town where he was a former president of the Rotary Club and a leading member of the golf and cricket clubs. One prominent resident, who did not want to be named, added: 'Everybody has shut up about it - no one wants to talk about it. 'Members of the golf club, the tennis club and the rotary club have all been hit by it.' Dickinson’s con was eventually uncovered and he was charged with carrying on a business for a fraudulent purpose and being involved in a regulated financial activity when not permitted to do so. The Bernie Madoff of Fricton-on-Sea: Locals in Fricton-on-Sea have compared Ian Dickinson to Bernie Madoff - pictured left - a New York financier jailed for 150 years after defrauding New York investors of £39 billion . Speaking when the scheme was unravelled, one local said: ‘He is a very loud, well spoken and larger-than-life Hooray Henry character who adores being the centre of attention. ‘But I don’t think he is welcome round here any more - and that is putting it very politely. 'There are people who have lost a fortune due to his apparently reckless dealings.’ Another said: ‘The joke around here is that he’s the Bernie Madoff of Frinton-on-Sea.' The 'joke' references the disgraced American financier, once a respected member of New York society, now serving a 150-year sentence for defrauding investors of £39 billion. Dickinson was bailed to an address in Ipswich, Suffolk, ahead of sentencing next month. In court: Dickinson was told he faces a lengthy jail sentence when he pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud at Chelmsford Crown Court .","Ian Dickinson, 49, convinced friends to invest millions in his company .

The former supermodel ranted as she left court after being convicted of punching an officer and fined more £1,065. She had drunk a bottle of wine before she tore the head off a sunflower and attacked the officer who had been called to her home after reports that she was threatening to kill herself.

Paula Hamilton's life has seen the model rise to fortune and fame before falling into a battle with drink and court cases. In 1987 she appeared in a famous advert for the VW Golf. Made up to look like Princess Diana, she played a glamorous blonde who petulantly discarded her wedding ring, her mink coat and her man, but refused to abandon the keys to her car. 'If only everything in life was as reliable as a Volkswagen,' ran the tagline, and so the legend of Paula Hamilton was created. But she became famous for her struggle with drink and drugs, confessing she used to drink 'in order to die'. In September last year she was found collapsed in an alley with her three front teeth missing after she crashed her car drink-driving. In November she was banned from driving for 14 months and fined £160 for drink-driving. She asked to go on an alcohol vehicle awareness course, which will reduce her ban by three months. The star, who suffers from a complex amalgam of conditions, including Asperger's, dyslexia and dyspraxia, which affects her movement, was then invited to star on Celebrity Big Brother in January. But the contestant was the first to be evicted from the house. Speaking outside the court Hamilton criticised magistrates and police and described herself as an 'eccentric'. 'I think it's very sad that if I was . Miss Bridget Jones, lying on the sofa drinking wine, that would be okay. But because I'm an eccentric and I have a different lifestyle, I'm . treated like this,' she said. 'I had a drink, a bottle of wine like Bridget Jones.

Hamilton, who was the first housemate . evicted from the latest series of Celebrity Big Brother, claimed . officers had then brutally beaten her and taken her to a police station . while she was wearing nothing but a coat.

A pensioner faces being taken to court by a multi-millionaire Tory peer in a row over a patch of land next to his recycling yard. Tom McAllister, who runs a pallet recycling firm, is at loggerheads with staff at landowner and banker Lord Home’s country estate. Mr McAllister says he decided to spruce up an ‘eyesore’ patch of land at the entrance to his premises after a search to find out who owned it proved fruitless. Clash: Tom McAllister (right) has been ordered to vacate a patch of land outside his recycling centre by staff at landowner and banker Lord Home's (left) country estate . The businessman claimed he spent £10,000 to clear the 0.3 acre site at Rigside, Lanarkshire, and now uses it to park his trailers and give out free fire wood to the local community. However, lawyers for Lord Home have now insisted it is part of his country estate and an adjoining estate owned by the Carmichael family. The peer’s family company Douglas and Angus Estates have threatened to take Mr MCAllister to court if he does not vacate the land. Dispute: The legal wrangle centres around a patch of land at the entrance to Mr McAllister's premises which he is currently using to park his trucks and give out free wood to the local community . Investment: Mr McAllister claims he spent around £10,000 clearing the . site and that if he is removed from the land it would have a significant . effect on his business . Mr McAllister, 67, said: 'We have spent a lot of time and money clearing the site which was previously a dumping ground. 'We checked with the Registers of Scotland and couldn’t find a clean title for the land so we decided to clear it ourselves. 'I hadn’t heard anything for a couple of . years and then this lawyer’s letter arrived out of the blue telling us . to clear the land within seven days. The letter ordering Mr McAllister off the land . 'We use the site to park trailers and to dispense fire wood for free to the local community, which is much appreciated in an area of high unemployment. 'If we are removed from the land we would have nowhere to park the trailers and it would have a significant effect on our business. 'Lord Home’s estate have teamed up with the Carmichael estate and are now threatening to take us to court, it’s ridiculous. 'The site is of absoultely no use to them but they seem hell-bent on removing us. 'I’m determined to fight this.'Lord Home is chairman of the Queen’s bank Coutts and son of ex-Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home. He has sparked fury by brokering a deal to let Scottish Coal mine his land in Lanarkshire for a fee. Last year, environmental protestors invaded the ground of his mansion on the estate and dug up his lawn. Last night(FRI), Henry Birch, the factor of Douglas and Angus Estates, said: 'The site was clear and unobstructed when Mr McAllister took it over. 'It was previously unclear if ourselves or the Carmichael estate owned the land but we are now both registered as joint owners. 'We have offered in the past to lease the land to Mr McAllister but he has not taken up our offer. 'We felt that our only recourse was to take legal action. 'If he does not vacate the site we will take action to forcibly remove him.

Officer: Dayvon Maurice Green, a 23-year-old engineering student worked as a police auxiliary officer at the University of Maryland for about two weeks before shooting his two roommates . The University of Maryland shooter who fatally shot his roommate and seriously shot another before turning the gun on himself previously worked for the campus police its been revealed. Dayvon Maurice Green, a 23-year-old engineering graduate student, worked as a police auxiliary officer on the College Park campus before being fired, a university police spokesman said on Wednesday. The student who police say set a series of small fires inside the home to draw his two roommates outside before ambushing them was fired after about two weeks in August and September said spokesman Marc Limansky after twice failing to show up for work. Green did not carry a badge or a gun while on duty, but had a police radio that would allow him to summon a sworn officer if he spotted trouble. Early Tuesday morning police say Green fatally shot 22-year-old Stephen Alex Rane from Silver Springs and 22-year-old Neal Oa who survived his injuries. Green then turned the gun on himself. Green's family told police that he had been suffering from mental illness for at least a year and had been prescribed medication. A law enforcement officer speaking to the Washington Examiner said he suffered schizophrenia. Killed: Stephen Alex Rane, 22, from Silver Springs (pictured) was shot dead on Tuesday morning while fleeing a fire set by Green to intentionally draw him and Neal Oa outside according to police . Ambush: An unidentified male student, who attends the University of Maryland, is taken to hospital following the murder-suicide at a home close to campus in the early hours on Tuesday . Trap: Green fled the burning home with his two roommates before police say he pulled out a gun and began firing . Police say Green started several fires . in the basement of the small property and in the yard off campus. The . flames awoke his two housemates who fled outside, where he opened fire . on them with a handgun. Rane was shot where he stood while Oa was hit while running away. The shooter then went to the backyard of the home where he committed suicide, Prince George's County police said. Green was armed with an  Uzi submachine gun, a machete, baseball bat and ammunition along with the handgun with which he shot his victims, according to authorities. Emergency: Fire crews attended the scene close to the college campus as the alleged shooter had set several small fires . Lock-down: The shooting occurred at 1am on Tuesday and emergency crews quickly swarmed the scene . Heavily armed: Green was armed with an Uzi sub-machine gun (stock image) but did not use the weapon police said . An official told the Washington Post that Green could have inflicted far more serious damage with the more high-powered weapon. Students at the college were informed of the shooting via text message as the campus issued a high alert. Witnesses said that police were on the scene five minutes after the gunshots were heard. The home is not part of university housing and the street is a mix of college students and families.","Davyon Green, 23, worked as a police auxiliary officer for the university before fired for failing to show up for work .

Outraged families have complained after discovering that their local council had put their front gardens up for auction. Neighbours in Canvey Island, Essex, say they only found out when a brochure arrived advertising their four gardens as a single lot to be sold for development. The householders, one of whom says the land is the only access he has to his house, have rented the strips of land from Essex County Council for 25 years. 'I will be trespassing to get to my own front door': Homeowner Mark Durant in his front garden in Canvey Island . Aerial shot showing the land the council is selling, including the strip giving access to Mr Durant's home . 'Someone could pitch a caravan in my front garden and I would be powerless': Mike Bering in front of the land . Now their four gardens are up for auction as one lot with a guide price of £2,000, and Mark Durant, whose front garden offers the only access to his home in Marine Parade, has the most to lose. Mr Durant, 41, said: 'I would technically be trespassing across someone else's land to get to my own front door. 'What if the owner refused to let me access my own home? What would I do?' Neighbour Mike Bering, 61, also of Marine Parade, said: 'Anyone could buy the land. 'Someone could just turn up, pitch up a caravan in our front garden, and I would be looking down at them from my balcony, powerless to stop them. 'They could cut down all my trees, rip up the path and what could I do about it? It's just such bad practice from the council. Wanting reimbursement for the work they've done: Bill and Jean Graham in their Beck Road garden . The land in question lies beyond the gravel path crossing the picture, which was taken from the Becks' house . 'The very least they could have done is spoken to us individually and given us the chance to buy what we feel is essentially our land.' The residents say they have been fighting for years to purchase their gardens, but have been refused permission by the county council. Those affected live on three separate roads, Marine Parade, Zider Pass and Beck Road.  Because the four gardens are being sold as a single lot, if one of the families decided to foot the £2,000 bill, they would also own their neighbours' gardens. Bill Graham, 66, of Beck Road, said: 'I am absolutely disgusted this can be allowed to go ahead. 'How would I feel if I did buy it, going up to Mike and saying I've just bought your land? 'One thing's for certain: I will be . wanting reimbursement for all the years and all the money I've spent . making my garden look beautiful.' Furious: Resident Angela Hart in front of the land that Essex County Council is auctioning off later this month . Mark Durant, Angela Hart, Mike Bering, and Jean and Bill Graham, left to right, say the first they knew was when the auction brochure arrived . Dave Blackwell, leader of the Canvey Independent Party, is writing to county council chief executive Joanna Killian on behalf of residents to try to stop the auction going ahead. He said: 'The residents contacted me because they were so desperate, they didn't know what to do. In all my time in public life I have never heard of anything as ridiculous as this.' The auction, which is being held by Lambert Smith Hampton, will take place at the Millennium Hotel, in Grosvenor Square, London on February 25. An Essex County Council spokesman said: 'While we appreciate the residents' situation, the land concerned is Essex County Council land, and this would have been made clear when the houses were bought. 'Essex County Council, through our agents, visited all of the auction sites and where possible made contact with all those with an interest in the land. 'We have had no approaches, prior to the auction, from anyone interested in buying the land.  However the auctioneers have discussed how to bid for this land with the homeowners, as this offers a quick and cheaper opportunity for them to buy this land.'","Four garden plots in Canvey Island, Essex, to be auctioned off for £2,000 .

A grandmother, who claimed she could not walk, has been caught on camera delivering sandwiches despite receiving £11,000 in disability benefits. Julie Peters, 56, who runs Victoria Sandwich in Horwich, Bolton, Greater Manchester, was filmed making deliveries and carrying shopping bags, after telling the Department of Work and Pensions she could not walk and claiming benefits for seven years. The woman from Breightmet, Bolton, was convicted of dishonestly claiming disability living allowance at Manchester City Magistrates' Court, and will be sentenced later after she was caught following a tip-off. Peters told The Bolton News six years ago that she beat depression following breast cancer surgery by launching the sandwich business with her daughter, Vicki. Despite bouncing back from breast cancer she became depressed but she said her new business venture had helped her beat the illness. Victoria Sandwich's website prides itself as being staffed by ‘some of the nicest people you will meet’. The firm specialises in eat-ins takeaways and buffets. After she opened the business, Peters said: ‘Vicki and I decided to get a place of our own together, and this gave me a real purpose in life. Claimed for seven years: Peters (pictured with daughter in front of her business Victoria Sandwich) was convicted of dishonestly claiming disability living allowance because she said she could not walk . ‘When I was at my lowest, I just needed to keep strong and positive and find a way forward - I never dreamed that I'd cook up the answer myself.’ Lord Freud, Minister for Welfare Reform said: ‘Benefit thieves are costing the taxpayer £1.2 billion per year. ‘This money is intended to help those most in need not line the pockets of criminals.

Her sentencing comes as Patrick Wildman, 47, was convicted after he was caught working as a delivery driver while  claiming he could not walk, pocketing £27,000 in benefits.

An adorable 999 recording has revealed the moment a five-year-old boy is told police are on the way to rescue his mother and sister after they became trapped in a bedroom. Jacob Rees remained the coolest head in the house after his sister Lauren, seven, accidentally locked mother Rachel Clarke into a room with a broken lock during a game of hide and seek. With no mobile phone or way of escaping, Ms Clarke panicked - as Jacob and his two-year-old brother James were alone in the family's house in Bristol. SCROLL DOWN TO LISTEN . Reunited: Jacob Rees, five, with his mother Rachel, sister Lauren, seven and brother James, two . But after shouting under the door and sliding notes to Jacob, the schoolboy followed her instructions to use the phone to try and call Ms Clarke's partner Stephen and family friends. When no one answered she told him to dial 999 in exasperation. After calmly explaining the situation, an operator told Jacob someone was on the way to help. The ecstatic youngster was so happy he shouted through the door: 'I did it mummy, they are coming right now!' Police soon arrived and managed to free Ms Clarke and Lauren. Hairdresser Rachel, 41, said: 'I am so proud of Jacob. He was . brilliant and stayed so calm. At one point he even said to me - 'mummy, . is this going to take much longer? I'm getting bored now.' 'If it hadn't been for him we would have been stuck in there until my partner Stephen got home at 5.30pm.' The children were treated with a trip to the cinema and a meal out while Jacob was also praised by the police for his actions. Proud: Jacob Rees remained cool and calm as he dialled 999 and explained to the operator how his mother was trapped in a bedroom . MS Clarke said: 'My mind was racing and worried because there were knives in drawers and nobody was supervising them. 'I didn't have my mobile phone with . me, and didn't know what to do. I started to slide paper under the door with numbers for Jacob to go and try on the phone. 'He has never had to use a phone before but he managed to phone my partner but the he had no reception. 'I thought about getting Jacob to go next door but I was worried what might happen to him. 'I tried to get him to phone a few more family members but he wasn't having any luck so as a last resort I got him to phone 999. 'I must have been in there for about an hour. When officers finally got to me they just found me in tears. PC Matthew Hearn, who rescued Rachel, said: 'When we initially arrived we spoke with Jacob through the front door, he was calm and informed us to use the back door, he then unlocked the back door to allow us entry and showed us to the upstairs bedroom. 'The internal door was solid wood and the door handles were not present, it was clear that the mother was extremely distressed about the safety of her three young children, so I forced entry to the room. 'After releasing the very relieved mother we spent some time with the family commending Jacob's actions.'

Killed by drinking too much water: Matthew Ellis went into a coma when his salt levels dropped dangerously low after he downed seven litres of water . A man died from drinking too much water after his alcohol may have been 'spiked with ecstasy', an inquest heard. Matthew Ellis, 29, developed a sudden craving for water and drank around seven litres - the equivalent of 14 pints - within a few hours before he began to have fits and collapsed at home. The heating and ventilation engineer was rushed to hospital but the salt levels in his body had sunk so low he suffered brain damage, went into a coma and died seven months later. His mother Maureen, 63, said after . the hearing: 'He wouldn't have taken ecstasy himself. It must have been . slipped into his drink for him to want to have so much water. He would . drink a glass of water like anybody else but at normal levels, not to . that extent.' Mr Ellis . had been out drinking with friends on the evening of Boxing Day in 2010 . and was admitted to hospital drunk and described as 'walking around . going mad, pressing imaginary buttons'. When . he sobered up he was discharged on December 27 and was taken home by . his father Kenneth, 67, and his elder brother Andrew, 36. His . brother told the Sheffield inquest: 'He was sat down on the settee. His . pupils were absolutely massive and he was unsteady on his feet. He . looked like he had taken something. 'I have seen him drunk on occasions but that is the first time I have seen him looking like that.' The next day Mr Ellis started on his water binge. His brother continued: 'He was drinking it to the point where we noticed it was a bit abnormal. He was sat on the settee and started sweating, really sweating. I told him to take his coat off and he went upstairs. 'He got to the sink and went to have . another glass of water. I told him it was dangerous to drink so much . water, he just laughed it off.' Tragic: Mr Ellis was rushed to the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield where he was given saline solution to try and boost his salt levels but he died seven months later . His brother then had to stop Matthew falling downstairs as he collapsed and began having fits. He was taken to Sheffield's Northern General Hospital on December 28 and briefly made a recovery before he relapsed and died on August 4, 2011. Dr Mike Heap, consultant in anaesthesia, said Mr Ellis suffered an acute drop in his blood sodium levels from a normal level of 142 on Boxing Day to a critical 107 two days later. He said: 'You have to be given or take on a lot of water for that. It occurs in people who for whatever reason drink a lot of water very quickly.' The drop was equivalent to about six or . seven litres of water. He said it could have been associated with taking . ecstasy but added: 'What made him drink excess quantities of water I . don't know.' Doctors tried to correct his low sodium level by giving him concentrated doses of saline solution to reduce a swelling on his brain as if left untreated he would have died then. Dr Heap said a combination of the low sodium, the brain swelling and the seizures all contributed to his 'extreme' form of brain injury. He said: 'All this stems from drinking too much water.' Dr Stephen Wharton, neuropathology consultant, said Mr Ellis suffered a rare brain condition called extrapontine myelinolysis, a brain cell dysfunction which destroys the layer covering the nerve cells in the brain stem. The widespread brain damage was related to the swelling and seizures associated with his low blood sodium levels caused by drinking too much water. Pathologist Dr Kim Suvarna gave the cause of death as a chest infection contributed to by a lack of oxygen to the brain and drug and alcohol abuse. Matthew's father Kenneth, 67, of Lowedges, Sheffield, said when he and Andrew brought Matthew home he spent the rest of the day watching television on the sofa. They only noticed him drinking copious amounts of water the next day and by 7pm he had collapsed. His friend could not tell the family why Matthew had suddenly become so ill. Kenneth Ellis said: 'When he was in hospital he had lost his laughter and was no longer the comedian. It was a terrible shame to see him in that hospital bed.' Assistant deputy coroner Louise Slater said: 'It is probable that the cause of death has arisen from some deliberate human act which has gone wrong.' Afterwards Mrs Ellis of Gleadless, Sheffield said: 'I just want people to know that drinking too much water can be dangerous. I hope Matthew's death was not in vain and that somebody else might be saved.' The coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure.","Matthew Ellis, 29, was admitted to hospital drunk on Boxing Day in 2010 .

A decorative plate which hung precariously on a wall behind a door on a flimsy piece of wire has sold for almost £570,000 after it turned out to be an ancient relic. The woman who owned it had no idea of its true value and had kept the Italian pottery plate on her kitchen wall in her cottage home for many years. She only realised its importance when she invited an antiques expert to her home in Somerset to value some items. Ancient relic: This 16th century Italian plate hung precariously on a wall behind a door on a flimsy piece of wire before an art expert suspected it might be worth a lot of money. It sold at auction yesterday for £567,000 . Richard Bromell suspected it might have been valuable and carefully removed it from the wall. He later identified it as Italian Maiolica (tin-glazed) pottery dating to about 1540. He said it was lucky the plate had not been damaged by the door being slammed open against it. Despite it having an inch long repaired crack at its base, Mr Bromell told the unidentified woman it was in excellent condition and could be worth £100,000. But the plate, which depicts a scene called The Feast of Herod, sold for an incredible £567,000 pounds when it was auctioned yesterday. The owner, who had inherited the item from a relative, was said to have been delighted with the price. Mr Bromell described the find as a true 'Only Fools and Horses' moment, similar to when Del Boy found an old pocket watch that had been hidden in his garage for years and only for it to be worth millions. Measuring 16 inches in diameter, the plate depicts the feast of Herod, . following a print by German printmaker Sebald Beham in which the king . and his wife are approached by Salome with the head of St John the Baptist. The . scene also shows a town, a river with bathers and a boat party. Art expert Richard Bromell suspected the plate might be valuable and later identified it as Italian Maiolica pottery dating to around 1540 . Mr Bromell, of auctioneers Charterhouse of Sherborne, Dorset, said: ‘It was just hanging on wall from a wire frame almost hidden away and it turned out to be worth a fortune. ‘It had been there for years. She had inherited it and grown up with it but did not attach a great deal of value to it. ‘It was on the wall behind a door which was always open so you could only see about two inches of it. ‘When the wind blows through a house it can open and shut doors so it is quite frightening to think what could have happened if the door had blown back on to the plate. ‘In the position it was in it is lucky nothing happened to it over the years. ‘This is undoubtedly the most important piece of pottery I have held in my 28 years experience in this industry and is one of the highest prices ever paid for a piece of Italian pottery. ‘It was quite dusty when we first looked at it but the condition it is in for something which is nearly 500 years old is superb. The quality of the drawing on the surface is splendid.’ Mr Bromell said when he first saw the . plate he thought it was a 19th century copy which would be worth a . couple of thousand pounds. 'Important piece of pottery': The plate depicts the feast of Herod in which St John the Baptist's head is presented on a plate . But after taking the plate to Professor Timothy Wilson at The Ashmolean Museum at the University of Oxford he discovered it was worth a lot more. Prof Wilson inspected the plate and concluded it was made in the Italian walled city of Urbino around 1540. Mr Bromell said: ‘I was a bit nervous when I was driving it to the museum. I was taking extra care to avoid any pot holes.’ When it came to auction, there was interest among bidders from across the UK, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Portugal, Switzerland and the U.S. Mr Bromell said: ‘I was expecting it to fetch over £100,000 but it certainly exceeded those expectations without question. It was a fantastic result for the client.’ The winning bid came from London jewellery dealers SJ Phillips Ltd. Francis Norton, director of the company, said: ‘The plate is in wonderful condition and we really fancied it and were determined to get it. ‘We don't know what we'll do with it yet but we might put it on display.’","Owner had no idea of its true value, hanging it behind the kitchen door .

Escape: Paul Harding, a canteen worker at a top public school, sent vile child porn images over the internet . A canteen worker at a top private school , who was caught sending out 'depraved' child porn pictures over the internet, has escaped a prison sentence. Paul Harding, 50, shared films of children as young as six being abused and had more images on his home computer. He also visited online chat sites where he told other paedophiles how he wanted to 'groom' a child who he would use to  recruit other youngsters. Harding, a catering supervisor at prestigious Dulwich College in southeast London, was spared jail by Judge Andrew Goymer who was a former student there. He said: 'You have escaped prison by a gap so narrow that you could hardly see daylight through it. 'It needs to be spelled out that when these images are produced somewhere in the world a child is being abused to make them to satisfy the depraved tastes of people who enjoy looking at them.' Harding was handed a 16-month prison term, suspended for a year, and banned from working with children indefinitely. Officers from the Metropolitan Police's paedophile unit swooped on his home address in May 2012 as part of an ongoing crackdown on online child abusers, Southwark Crown Court heard. Peter Zinner, prosecuting, said: 'As a result of these investigations an individual was identified. 'It was further established that individual was Paul Harding and that he was in the employ of Dulwich Boys School as a catering supervisor. 'Because of his proximity to boys and the suspicion that he might be a paedophile police officers expedited the application for a search warrant and on May 3, 2012, police officers attended his home address.' Harding's Fujitsu Siemens laptop was seized and 22 images, 12 of which were at the two highest levels of severity, and four films at the second highest level were discovered. One film, approximately two minutes long, was entitled 'Mum, dad and son'. Analysis of the computer showed Harding had been talking with other paedophiles online. Prestigious: Harding worked at Dulwich College school in south west London. The judge who spared him jail was a former pupil there . Mr Zinner said: 'The e-chat . demonstrated that there was discussion about the more extreme end of . sexual abuse of children and that there was discussion about a desire to . groom children, or a child, with a view to hands-on sexual abuse.' In . one sick exchange, Harding claimed he wanted to 'groom a young kid and . educate him in the best sex going and get him to recruit young kids . too'. Mark Bagshaw, defending, said the school worker had become entangled in a 'cycle of addiction'. He said that since his arrest he had been speaking with Stop it Now! - an organisation aimed at preventing child sex abuse. Analysis of Harding's laptop revealed he had visited chat sites where he told other paedophiles how he wanted to groom a child (file picture) Judge Goymer, who declared his ties to the school before the hearing began, said: 'You should be under no doubt whatsoever about the seriousness of the offences you have committed and the harm that they have caused. 'It's very easy for people who commit the offence of downloading images of children to think it is a victimless crime. 'They think that because they are not touching the children, not in sexual contact with the children, that they are just looking at a picture, if you pause and think for just a few seconds you will realise that's not a realistic way of looking at it.' Harding, of South Norwood, south east London, pleaded guilty to four counts of distributing indecent images of children, six counts of making indecent images of children and two charges of possession of a controlled substance after officers recovered small amounts of crystal-meth and the class C drug GBL. He was sentenced to 16 months in jail, suspended for one year, and made the subject of a 12 month supervision requirement. He was also ordered to complete up to 60 days of an internet sexual offending activity requirement and banned from working with children indefinitely.

Two conmen who swindled vulnerable elderly people out of thousands of pounds by posing as workmen have been jailed for 'bleeding' their victims of every penny they had. Steven Wood, 30, and his brother-in-law Ryan Lowe, 21, were both jailed after they demanded money from Kathleen Gardner, 81, and Peter Rothwell, 86 for botched building work. Jointly, they defrauded them of nearly £80,000, and the frail pair were both forced to go into care homes after they were duped. Yesterday Teesside Crown Court heard that Wood is already serving a three and a half year sentence for exploiting three vulnerable pensioners. The con men Steven Wood (left) and Ryan Lowe (right) swindled the pair out of their money as a ruse for 'building work' It was only when widow Mrs Gardner stood up to her tormentors that her family and the police realised that she had been exploited by the pair who posed as workmen and carried out shoddy building 'repairs ' to her home. Mrs Gardner was charged well in excess of £6,000 for a botched building repair which - even if it had been carried out competently - was valued at just £30. Nephew Michael Hall said his aunt had a clock on her mantel piece which she treasured because it had been given to her by her late husband Aubrey. When the men threatened to take the clock unless she wrote them another cheque she was so frightened that she called Mr Hall 200 miles away in St Albans. Mr Hall, 64, an Assistant Investigator for Hertfordshire Police, called police - and what the judge called Lowe and Wood's 'conspiracy' to target the elderly finally began to unravel. Richard Bennett, prosecuting for North Yorkshire Trading Standards, told the court: 'Wood has made a career out of targeting elderly and vulnerable victims. Victim Kathleen Gardner paid £6,000 for a job that should have cost £30 . 'His activities have generated a large amount of money over a number of years. 'Lowe made it his business to identify house-holders who could be easily over charged for gardening or property work. 'In the current case, he was able to find two ideal victims. 'Both were elderly people, both lived alone, and both suffered from dementia.' Mrs Gardner, of Thornton Dale, North Yorkshire, who suffered from memory loss, was conned out of nearly £6,000 before she told her nephew she was being threatened. The same day she went into a home where she still resides. 'She was placed into care very rapidly and as a direct consequence of the fraud,' Mr Bennett added. Both her bank and the village postmistress became suspicious and cheques were stopped - but by then the men had moved on to widower Mr Rothwell, of Haxby, near York, who they stole £72,000 from. He was charged for 'building and gardening' work, but when his home was examined by an expert surveyor and an arboriculturalist, no evidence could be found of any work at all having been carried out. Mr Bennett added: 'He would leave large piles of cash lying around his house. He was the perfect victim for Lowe and Wood.' His daughter Jane Rothwell returned from Crete to find not only was no substantial work carried out on the property, but a number of valuables had been stolen. He has now had to go into a care home. Defending counsel asked the Recorder of Middlesbrough Simon Bourne-Arton to consider both men's guilty pleas and that Lowe was of previous good character. Wood, who was jailed last year for the West Yorkshire offences, was sentenced to four and a half years for six fraud and money laundering offences. One of his previous victims, an . 82-year-old woman from Wetherby who Wood conned into driving to her bank . on her mobility scooter to withdraw £3,500 for gardening work. He duped her into believing she would be fined £7,000 unless she had some conifers removed. The judge told him: 'From 2008 to 2012 you have set about a determined targeting of vulnerable, infirm and elderly victims.' 'You did so out of one motive and one motive only - sheer greed. 'What you did was to bleed these victims of what little money they had left' 'You did so without any thought or care for the consequences of your offending. 'You had no thought at all of the misery you would cause to those you targeted in the latter part of their lives. 'In all probability, it caused Mrs Gardner to go into care prematurely. You gave no thought whatsoever to any of that. 'What you did - both of you - was to bleed these victims of what little money they had left and in the case of the gentleman it was a very considerable amount of money. 'You have set out in quite a determined way to commit these offences and do not let the inconvenience of being arrested stop you in any way throughout your career as a criminal.' Lowe, of Bickerton, Wetherby, admitted 13 fraud and money laundering offences. Jailing Lowe for three years, the judge told him it would have four if it was not for his early guilty plea. Outside court, Mr Hall said his aunt and other elderly victims had been robbed of their last few years of independent living. 'These people are from a generation which believes there is good in everyone. They don't realise there are bad people out there trying to take their money,"" he said. 'It was probably these despicable people taking the clock that made my aunt take a stand. They said unless they got a cheque they would take it.' County council Head of Fraud Ruth Andrews said: 'Victims such as this have a right to live their last years in comfort and security and not to be targeted by abhorrent defendants such as these.'","Two conmen robbed vulnerable pensioners of their money and independence .

Education Secretary Michael Gove's reforms of the A-Level system have come under fire from the Russell Group of top universities . Britain's's top universities have warned against radical Government plans to hive off AS-levels as a standalone qualification. They said they were 'not convinced' that the move is necessary, and raised concerns that without a direct link to A-levels, new-style AS-levels may not be as beneficial. AS-levels in their current form are valued by universities, allow students to study a broader range of subjects and can encourage bright pupils from poorer backgrounds to continue their studies, according to the Russell Group. Under a major shake-up of A-levels, announced by Education Secretary Michael Gove last month, AS-levels are set to be separated from A-levels to become a qualification in their own right. Teenagers taking A-levels will no longer sit exams after one year, and will instead be tested at the end of their two-year course. Setting out his plans, Mr Gove said he had concluded that there was a 'compelling case' for a move to A-levels with final exams. But Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group - which represents a group of 24 universities including Oxford and Cambridge - suggested they had some concerns about the proposals. 'AS-levels in their existing form are valued by universities,' she said. 'We have argued that AS-levels in their current format are important in giving students the opportunity to take an additional smaller qualification in a contrasting subject alongside their main A-level subjects. 'This adds valuable breadth and flexibility to their learning programme, and can encourage the take-up of strategically important subjects. 'We are not convinced therefore that a new standalone AS qualification is necessary and are concerned that, with no links to the A-level, it may not deliver the same benefits as the existing AS-levels.' The Russell Group says AS-Levels in their current form allow students to study a broader range . of subjects and can encourage bright pupils from poorer backgrounds to . continue their studies . Dr Piatt said that results from AS-levels taken by sixth-formers at the end of their first year of study are useful to universities when looking at applications, particularly for the most competitive courses. 'Without access to such information, it will be even more difficult for our institutions to identify the most talented students from amongst the very many applicants with excellent results at GCSE. 'AS-level results after one year of study can also be effective in giving talented students from poorer backgrounds the confidence to apply to a highly selective university, thus helping to widen participation.' Dr Piatt added: 'Whilst we have welcomed the Government's review of the modular structure of the A-level, we do not believe this need be extended to the complete removal of the AS examination from the A-level.'","Major shake-up was announced by Education Secretary Michael Gove .

ITV today unveiled a colourful, modern logo as part of a multi-million-pound rebrand - but the design's curvy 'i' and 't' may risk being mistaken for a 'w'. The broadcaster's new look has been in the works for around a year and will extend across ITV's television channels, website and buildings. The logo, which was designed in-house, will come into use in January. The network describes it as 'a warm, bold design based on a formalised version of human handwriting'. Fresh style: The broadcaster's new logo will be used between programmes as well as on all its buildings . Does it work for you? The design was created in-house and took around a year to produce . As part of the makeover, its flagship channel - renamed ITV1 in 2001 - will now be known simply as ITV. Director of Marketing and Research Rufus Radcliffe said: 'In an ever more crowded market place, . both domestically and internationally, the need for a modern, flexible . brand identity that connects with our viewers and customers has never . been more important. 'We are really excited to soon be unveiling a new . identity that is as up-to-date, and relevant as our content. 'Big, bold . and creatively ambitious, it will be true to our DNA as a brand at the . heart of popular culture.' The way it was: ITV1 was introduced in 2001 - but now the flagship channel will simply be 'ITV' The revamp of the ITV logo has been ridiculed by viewers who claim the motif looks like a sex toy or a crayon scribbling. Viewers have voiced their displeasure on Twitter, describing the design as 'super disgusting' and 'hilariously dreadful'. Famousmales even went as far as congratulating his six-month-old nephew for designing the logo 'using only wax crayons and some sick'. WelshDalaiLama tweeted: 'This is either the most complicated product you can buy at Ann Summers OR it’s the new ITV logo. Can’t decide which.' While TheMediaTweets said: 'Leading opinions on ITV logo: 1) It looks like a bum 2) Looks like a kid did it 3) It’s still better than London2012.' And Mikeshaw10 wrote: 'The new ITV logo looks like something a local charity would use after Debbie in marketing goes on a half-day Photoshop course.'

Others called it 'dreadful' and an 'epic fail' - although a handful found the cursive style 'funky' and 'friendly'.

'Idents' – the branded segments between programmes over which announcers . give information on the schedule.

The death of a bullied teenager who fell 60ft from her bedroom window was witnessed by one of her schoolboy tormentors, an inquest heard today. The boy, known as E6, started crying and said, 'That wasn't meant to happen', when he saw Chevonea Kendall-Bryan plummet to her death, according to a witness. He then cycled off without going for help, but later returned and watched paramedics try unsuccessfully to revive the 13-year-old. Chevonea had been repeatedly bullied by a group of boys - but teachers accused her of bullying them in turn, and made her sign a complex 'anti-bullying contract'. Hours before her death in March 2011, she discovered that a video of her being forced to perform sex act on E6 had been circulated among her classmates. During Chevonea's inquest at the Westminster Coroner's Court, neighbour Richard Umunegbu described how he was walking to the shops near his Battersea home when he saw the girl fall from a window in a block of flats. 'There was a boy on a push bike going in the same direction,' he said. 'He was about three metres away from me talking on the phone but I didn’t really hear what he was saying.' Mr Umunegbu continued: 'I heard a loud bang - it came from the flat I was walking past. 'The bang came from the block. I didn’t know what it was at first - my first reaction was to look away to the right. 'I looked back to the left and the boy on the phone spoke to me. He started to cry and said, ""Did you see that?"" He was kind of shocked.' He added: 'I saw the girl on the floor and the body wasn’t moving. The boy on the bike was too much in shock.' Death: The block of flats in Battersea where the teenager died after years of being bullied . According to Mr Umunegbu, the boy - whom he later identified as E6 - cycled away but soon returned with a friend, and watched as paramedics tried to save Chevonea's life. 'One little thing I remember him saying was that he was like, ""This wasn’t meant to happen,""' the neighbour said. When coroner Bernard Richmond asked how sure he was that E6 had said this, he replied: '100 per cent.' Chevonea suffered devastating brain injuries after falling from her bedroom window, and was declared dead later that evening. It also emerged today that the schoolgirl had been made to sign an anti-bullying agreement along with six teenage boys from her school who had tormented her. E6, who attended a different school and cannot be named for legal reasons, did not sign the agreement. Tragic: The girl's mother Amanda Kendall, left, has spoken of her heartbreak at the death of Chevonea, right . Zach Darlington, a child protection teacher at St Cecilia's School in Wandsworth, told the inquest that the pupils had been made to appear before him to work out their differences. 'If you accept there are incidents where the boys are the aggressors, you have to consider the occasions when Chevonea is the aggressor,' he said. ‘I know there’s more than one of the boys and I know she is female, but I have to consider if there are occasions where her actions towards them can be considered in the same way.' But Mr Richmond suggested that the language used in the contract was overly complex for the Year 9 schoolgirl. 'Chevonea was below average academically,' the coroner said. 'Her language was poor. You are making her sign something that is an anti-bullying contract, making her sign something that says she is bullying the boys.' 'The contract should be in plain English. Did it not occur to you to say before signing on the dotted line, do you understand what you are signing up for?' But Mr Darlington replied: 'I believe that they fully understood the behaviour that was expected of them.' Chevonea was bullied by classmates from the age of 11, and the abuse became worse after she accused a 15-year-old of raping her at a party. E6 allegedly forced her to repeat the sex act on him, and the incident was filmed by a friend who sent it to other pupils at their school. Chevonea posted a series of morbid messages on her Blackberry Messenger account on the evening of her death, saying, ‘F*** this life’ and telling a friend ‘he wants me to jump’. The teenager had a history of self-harm, and had tried to take a handful of paracetamol pills during a class, the inquest has been told. The hearing continues.

Troubled: Chevonea Kendall-Bryan, who died after falling from a block of flats, was filmed being forced to perform sex acts on two youths, an inquest heard today . A 13-year-old girl plunged 60 feet to her death after mobile phone footage of her being forced to perform sex acts on two youths began spreading around her school, an inquest heard today. Chevonea Kendall-Bryan, 13, had been forced into performing sex acts on the boys at a party just a month before her death in March 2011, the hearing was told. Westminster Coroner's Court today also heard of a 'chain' of mistakes from school staff responsible for pupil welfare. A friend of Chevonea spoke of how the video began circulating among pupils at St Cecilia's Church of England School in Wandsworth, south London, showing the tragic teen performing the sex acts. The friend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the hearing: 'There was girls on my bus talking about a video and Chevonea was in it. 'I saw it when I was at my friend's nan's. We were outside and some boys were next to us and they was like ""do you know Chevonea?"". 'They gave us the phone and said 'watch this'. I looked at it until I realised what was going on and then looked away.' The friend, named only as E3, told the hearing the boy with Chevonea in the video was black, and that someone else was recording it from directly behind the teen so she did not know if she knew she was being recorded. She added: 'There was a friend who was talking to me. 'She said Chevonea was getting bullied about the video because people from her school had seen or heard about it. 'Her friends were saying she weren't really happy and she was a bubbly person, but got really sad and weren't who she was.' The inquest also heard the teenager was branded a 'narcissistic attention-seeker' by the teacher in charge of child protection. Tragic: The hearing was told Chevonea Chevonea Kendall-Bryan, 13, was sexually-abused at a party and bullied before she died . Teacher Zach Darlington today admitted repeated failures, including giving the impression that Chevonea was a 'narcissistic attention-seeker' in a referral to a mental health authority. The inquest heard how Mr Darlington, who was the teacher responsible for child protection at the Church of England school, did not paint a 'clear picture' of the troubled teen in a letter to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), the inquest heard. Chevonea had been repeatedly bullied at the school by a gang of boys and had started cutting herself with scissors in class, the hearing was told. Mr Darlington, who handed in his notice before Chevonea's death, told the inquest he was 'let down' by Wandsworth social services who failed to pass the case on to mental health services. Sorrow: Floral tributes were laid outside Flat Seldon House in Battersea, where the 13-year-old fell to her death . But he did not know the school had a social worker who would have been able to offer advice and help fill in the referral. When asked by Westminster Coroner Bernard Richmond QC if he should have done anything differently, Mr Darlington replied: 'Yes. There are three main areas I would've done differently. 'Firstly, the delay in the sexual assault information being passed on. I waited for fuller information, but I should've let Mr Gallagher [the head teacher] know straight away. 'Secondly, I focused on the support which had already been given to Chevonea which led me to let social services fall off my radar and I shouldn't have done that. 'Finally, I hadn't painted a full picture on the CAMHS referral. I was trying to paint a picture on the behaviours Chevonea was displaying. 'I should've focused on other pupils. It would've have provided a clearer picture had I done that.' Mr Richmond said to Mr Darlington: 'The impression you gave was that she was narcissistic and attention-seeking.' Mr Darlington replied: 'If that is the conclusion, that was not my intention.' However, when rumours of the sexual activity began to circulate around the school Mr Darlington said he did not know how to deal with the abuse claims. He told the inquest he turned to head teacher Mr Gallagher for advice what to do when the allegations first came to light. He said: 'Mr Gallagher was the person to speak with for advice. 'It was a situation I have never come across before. If he hadn't been in, I would contact him at home or contact someone else who had child protection training. 'I know it would not be an acceptable amount of delay for a child protection officer. I was slow and action should be taken as soon as possible.' However, Mr Richmond pointed out 'nobody seemed to understand' what was going to happen to Chevonea after the allegations surfaced because she had not been taken straight to a police station for DNA testing. Grief: Amanda Kendall at the inquest of her daughter Chevonea on Monday . Mr Darlington added: 'Contacting her family - that was our priority. Our intention was in the best interests of Chevonea and her family. Now we would drop everything.' The hearing also heard how a school nurse did not follow up a referral over Chevonea's self-harming because of 'work demands'. Sally Bishop was a nurse at Saint Cecilia's School and told the inquest she was qualified to deal with self-harm cases and took the work from Mr Darlington. However, although she saw Chevonea, she never followed up on the referral to mental health services because of 'work demands'. Evans Amoah-Nyamekye, representing the family, said to Mr Darlington: 'A teacher asked the nurse to see Chevonea because of her attendance due to health issues. 'There were reports of Chevonea cutting herself. 'There was a referral, but the nurse didn't follow it up because of work demands.' Mr Darlington replied: 'There weren't systems in place to check things were being followed up. 'I referred this to Ms Bishop because she was in an appropriate position to deal with self-harm.' Mr Richmond said: 'Well, she isn't because she can't prioritise.' Although Mr Darlington was told by the nurse, who has since retired, that she was an 'appropriate' person to speak to about Chevonea's problems, he did not take any steps to make sure she was, the inquest heard. And the teacher told the hearing it was not a child protection issue, even though the troubled teen was self-harming. Mr Darlington added: 'There comes a time where you have to trust people's professionalism. 'The impression you gave was that she was narcissistic and attention-seeking.' Coroner Bernard Richmond QC, speaking to Mr Darlington . 'If someone has a particular profession, we have to trust the professional words they have given us. It was not child protection, although it was self-harming.' Mr Richmond said: 'There is a difference between someone who has no problems with pupils and those who self-harm. 'If Chevonea threw herself out the window, that is one of the most destructive things she can do. 'If she did, it might be because of mental health problems that started when she cut herself.' He told the hearing the 'failure' is the 'start of a chain' of mistakes, and questioned Mr Darlington's referral to social services as it 'was not what it was meant to be' The teacher agreed, saying it 'wasn't as full as it should be' as he has not had 'direct training' in filling out the documents. And when he told the inquest Chevonea had become more 'positive' in Year 9, Mr Richmond said: 'What about if you were lulled into a false sense of security? You didn't chase up the referral form.' Mr Darlington replied: 'It fell of my radar.' The inquest continues.","The video of Chevonea Kendall-Bryan was allegedly distributed by pupils .

It is not the prettiest of towns, nor the wealthiest, but it does seem to possess the secret to a successful marriage. Six out of ten adults in Wimborne Minster are married, the highest proportion in  England and Wales and twice the rate of Manchester and some inner London boroughs. ‘East Dorset is the marriage hotspot of the country,’ said David Plumtree, of estate agency Barnard Marcus, which compiled the most married and most divorced districts, based on newly released figures from the 2011 national census. 'Marriage hotspot': Six out of ten adults in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, are married - the highest proportion in England and Wales . ‘This rural idyll is an especially attractive place to live because of its romantic landscape – sitting between the New Forest to the east and the Dorset coast to the south – and its relaxed pace of life.’ Wimborne Minster has a population of 15,000 and was once home to Thomas Hardy. It is surrounded by beautiful countryside, has plenty of historic buildings, a lack of modern architecture and a church which has attracted pilgrims for centuries. In the town and the surrounding East Dorset district – total population 87,000 – 59.4 per cent of adults are married, compared with 25.6 per cent in Islington, 27 in Lambeth, 27.4 in Hackney, 29.4 in Southwark and 29.7 in Manchester. 'Romantic landscape': In the district of East Dorset 59.4 per cent of adults are married . Less loved-up: In Islington, North London, the figure is 25.6 per cent . The area’s most recent claim to fame was in 2009, when it was revealed that it had the highest life expectancy in the country, with 86 per cent of women and 75 per cent of men expected to live to the age of 75. The other most-married districts are Amersham in Buckinghamshire and the surrounding Chiltern district at 58.5 per cent, followed by Hart in Hampshire – named last year as the place with the highest quality of life – at 58.4 per cent. They were followed by South Northamptonshire at 58.2 per cent, Wokingham 57.6, Mid Suffolk 56.7, North Kesteven in Lincolnshire, 56.7, Hambleton in North Yorkshire 56.5, Surrey Heath 56.4 and Harborough in Leicestershire, at 56.3 per cent. Although not far from the attractions of Bournemouth, Wimborne Minster’s couples might benefit from being inland, as nine out of the top ten most divorced districts are seaside areas. The list is led by Hastings, where 16.5 per cent of the population have had a marriage break-up. In Blackpool, the figure is 16.3 per cent, Margate 15.2, Torbay 14.8, Weymouth/Portland 14.7, Gosport 14.6, Eastbourne 14.4, the Isle of Wight 14.1, Corby 14.1 and Worthing at  14 per cent.","In Wimborne Minster, Dorset, six out of ten adults are married .

The family of a baby mauled by a fox in their home have been targeted by ‘vile’ internet trolls who blame them for what happened. Hayley Cawley, 28, walked into her living room to find it ‘covered in blood’ and a fox dragging five-week-old Denny towards the front door. She managed to wrestle her baby out of the animal’s mouth, but his finger was torn off in the attack on February 6. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shaken: The parents of baby Denny Dolan, Hayley Cawley and Paul Dolan, appeared on Daybreak and told of the horror of their ordeal . Frightening: Five-week-old Denny Dolan will be left permanently scarred following the fox attack . Denny had a five-hour operation to . have his finger reattached and yesterday he joined his parents for their . first TV appearance since it happened. Miss Cawley and Denny’s father Paul . Dolan, 27, spoke of their distress over Twitter comments which described . them as ‘stupid’ for leaving their front door ajar. Another claimed . they had fabricated the story and that a dog must have attacked their . son. Mother-of-three Miss Cawley said: . ‘They’ve been terrible. I had a little look last night [on Twitter]. I . did have a little look and then I had to close the page down because I . just thought, “Oh my God”. Saying about me having a dog and stuff – I’ve . never had a dog in my life.’ Lorraine Kelly, who interviewed the . family on ITV’s Daybreak, condemned the ‘vile’ trolls, saying: ‘It’s . absolutely disgusting. ‘How dare they attack you and your family. It is . bad enough that you are trying to get over this terrible ordeal without . coping with that too.’ During the interview, Mr Dolan cradled Denny, who bore scars on his face and head and had a large bandage around his left hand. Looking shaken, Miss Cawley, of Bromley, South-East London, admitted she was ‘not dealing . with it too well’ and said the attack was ‘the worst nightmare I have ever experienced in my life’. Since the incident, the couple have . called for more fox culling, saying, ‘if a dog had done this, it would . have been destroyed’.

Stuart Wood wrote: ‘If you own a dog and that dog attacked your baby in . some way but you didn’t want to report that, just tell the media a . killer fox broke in.’ Mr Dolan left the family home last week to pick up Miss Cawley’s two other children from school. But the door had recently been . ‘serviced’, meaning the catch was apparently looser than usual and did . not shut properly. He later received a phone call from his partner . saying, ‘a fox has attacked the baby, he’s bleeding everywhere’. Miss Cawley recalled how she had gone . upstairs to ‘tidy up’ when she heard Denny crying. She ran downstairs . to the living room, where she saw him being dragged towards the front . door. She hit and kicked the fox, but feared this was making it ‘sink . its teeth in even further’. She told a newspaper: ‘I got hold of . Denny’s wrist and tore it out of the fox’s mouth. I had no other choice. Its teeth were showing and it was making this awful noise, hissing and . growling. ‘I bent down and picked the baby up and it all went quiet. I remember looking at the fox and shutting the door calmly.’ The family have since moved out of . their home into temporary accommodation. Miss Cawley said: ‘I’d never go . back there.

A 13-year-old schoolgirl discovered that a rumour of her being filmed performing a sex act on a boy had been circulating just hours before she plunged 60ft to her death, an inquest heard. Chevonea Kendall-Bryan, who died in March 2011 in Battersea, south-west London, had changed her BlackBerry Messenger profile picture to someone with their head in a bin, saying: ‘F**k this Life’, the court was told. The troubled teenager spoke about wanting to die and had discovered the rumour circulating Saint Cecilia's School in Wandsworth, south-west London, Westminster Coroners’ Court heard. Chevonea had gone around school at the end of the day saying sorry for anything bad she had done and one friend said she ‘seemed suicidal’ for someone normally ‘bubbly and smiley’. ‘We talked through BBM, I was the person who told her about the video and I regretfully did it through BBM,’ the friend said. ‘I found out about the video on Tuesday from another friend.’ Another friend said: ‘She had put up a picture on her BBM profile sometime around 5pm of someone throwing their head in a bin saying ‘F**k this Life’.

A disabled man who starred in an emotional TV documentary about his rare illness has been found dead after driving his electric wheelchair into a lake. Brave Stuart Wickison, who was diagnosed with degenerative Duchenne muscular dystrophy aged three, was spotted by a child at Shinewater Park, Eastbourne, East Sussex. The 23-year-old, who starred in the 2007 Channel Five documentary Extraordinary People: The Boy Who Will Never Grow Old, had an illness which meant his body's muscles were slowly shutting down. Stuart Wickison died after crashing his electric wheelchair into a lake . Mr Wickison had began using a wheelchair aged 14 and had starred in the programme which focussed on how he dealt with the condition which only affects males. He needed 24-hour care at Shinewater Court in Eastbourne, and had told in the programme how he 'knew he would die some time soon'. In the programme, Stuart said: 'Of course, I go through moments of great bleakness and darkness when I think about what lies ahead, but I try not to dwell on it for too long otherwise I would go mad. 'I know that I will die some time soon, and that before I die I will be very ill - possibly paralysed and in pain.' He added: 'The issue of my death seems much more real and it is not a pleasant prospect. 'Instead, I think about how I want to live in the time I have left. I want to make my mark, to have achieved something. I have my art, my music and have just started at university.

It has been a series dogged with scandal, secrets and surprises, but in the finale of Breaking Amish, the five cast members finally got their chance to reveal the truths about their past lives. Whether or not they made the most of this opportunity to come clean is a different matter. Two of the characters refused to admit they had dated before appearing on the show - despite neighbours claiming they lived together in a trailer with their baby daughter. And other characters vehemently defended their questionable Amish lifestyles - including skimpy clothes, divorce, arrests and modelling careers - claiming they were 'normal'. Since its first episode aired in September, the show has repeatedly come under fire for deceiving . viewers about the five Amish and Mennonite men and women it follows as . they move to New York. Scroll down for video . Defensive: Rebecca and Abe became enraged when asked about the paternity of her baby in the finale . Secret: . This photo of the couple, who the TLC show had claimed met for 'the . first time' when they moved to New York for Breaking Amish, with a baby . was posted on the internet weeks ago . Weeks after a photo was posted on Breaking Amish the Truth showing cast members Rebecca and Abe with a . baby, Rebecca revealed she is divorced and confirmed she is a mother. But on the show's finale on Sunday, she refused to name the father of the baby. While Abe is rumoured to be the dad, the couple claims they only started dating on the show. 'I'm very sensitive when it comes to my . daughter because I'm trying to be a good mom,' Rebecca said as she refused to . talk about her child. 'I don't have to answer to anybody.' She continued: '[Fans] can believe whatever they . want, but if they want to know, they can watch the show. If they don't . want to believe, they don't have to believe it. Caught out: Rebecca claimed this photo of her in a bathing suit was taken when she 'snuck out' Past life: She has also explained that her teeth were all pulled out when she was 19 so she uses dentures . 'I don't give a s*** . what anybody thinks. People have to discuss our lives so much that we . can't even have our own life anymore. They're making us out to be . somebody I don't even know.' But while the couple refused to go into further details, friends have not been so shy, . revealing that Rebecca and Abe lived together while she was pregnant. 'They stayed in a camper behind our . home for several months in 2010 while Rebecca was pregnant with their . baby girl,' Shannon Edwards, from Columbia, Kentucky told the National . Enquirer. It has already been revealed that Rebecca left her first husband, Rufus Hostetler, to start a relationship with Abe in 2010. She was also filmed marrying Abe on the show. Rebecca was not to silent on other aspects of her former life, revealing that her teeth appeared different in earlier photos as she has since had them all removed and replaced with dentures. Final say: The cast members were given the chance to respond to accusations in the finale on Sunday . She explained that her parents made the decision when she was 19 to pull out all of her teeth, claiming it is an Amish tradition, yet dentists in the community have no formal training. She also attempted to explain an image on Facebook of her wearing a bikini - which is forbidden in her strict Amish community. She looked shocked when presented with the photo. 'Uh oh,' she said. 'No one's supposed to find out. I only wore a bikini one time.' When quizzed about the swimsuit, she snapped back: 'I'm wearing a bikini because I felt like it. Big deal, I snuck out, I had fun and never told nobody about it because nobody needs to know.' The other cast members didn't get off the hook about revelations made by friends and family members on the Facebook group, Breaking Amish The Truth. Denial: Jeremiah, who is divorced with three children, denied assaulting his wife and said he pays child support . Revealed: Jeremiah's wife, Naomi Stutzman, spoke to CBS21 about how Jeremiah repeatedly attacked her . Jeremiah was given the chance to respond . to revelations he is divorced from a woman who claims he repeatedly beat her . - and with whom he has three children, aged seven, five and three. The children live with their mother, Naomi Stutzman, . in Ohio. The couple married in 2005 and she filed for divorce in 2011, . citing gross neglect of duty, extreme cruelty and incompatibility. Speaking to CBS21, . Stutzman, who has also left the Amish community, called the show 'a . fake' and claimed: 'The kids and I suffered for years at the hands of this man.' On one occasion, he punched her in . the stomach while she was pregnant, a police report notes, while other records reveal he did not pay child support. 'Do your frickin' homework,' Jeremiah said. 'I did spend three days in jail for . supposedly [abusing her]. The court threw it out. I regret . that I didn't pay child support in the past, but I'm paying it now.' Wild: Pictures also show Jeremiah, left, surrounded by friends swigging from beer cans . Trust: Abe and Sabrina had earlier revealed they had sex during the show's filming and it was 'stupid' And Sabrina, the only Mennonite in the . group, was given the chance to comment on photographs showing her . getting married while wearing a decidedly non-Mennonite dress. She . was married in 2009 and has not been a practicing Mennonite . for years, friends claim. Other photographs on Facebook show her in skimpy clothing. But Sabrina said that the ceremony adhered to the community's traditions, there was no dancing or alcohol and she had a panel fitted into her dress to conceal her chest. 'I'm not ashamed I was married,' she said, confirming that her divorce is still pending. I still love him - he's a good man and . he's honorable. I have nothing but good things to say about him.' In the first part of the finale, . which aired last week, Jeremiah and Sabrina had admitted they had sex . during the filming - throwing yet more doubts on their devotion to their . faiths. Double life: Facebook photos apparently showed Sabrina kissing a man and wearing skimpy clothes . Insistence: But she maintained her wedding in 2009 was traditionally Mennonite, despite how it appeared . While a cast member claimed the couple had sex in a hotel lobby's bathroom, Sabrina denied it. Jeremiah added: 'If the world wants to know, we did it and enjoyed it.' 'And I made him stop,' Sabrina said. 'I was drunk both times. We were both trashed and started messing around. He sticks it in, and I . was like, No! I made him take it out. I don't consider that . actually doing it.' Jeremiah was also reportedly away from his Amish community for up to 14 years and is pictured on social networking sites surrounded by beer cans. TLC has also previously admitted that the fifth and final cast member, . Kate, who is billed as an Amish bishop's daughter and aspiring model, . has been arrested for a DUI. Dark pasts: TLC had previously admitted that Kate, pictured left on the show, was arrested for DUI, right . New life: On the show, Kate finds modelling work and wears a variety of skimpy outfits . But blogs revealed she also previously submitted images to modeling agencies - which is at odds . with the Amish stance against photographs, believing they represent . 'vanity' which they deem a sin. Online . records show that Kate posted a photograph on exploretalent.com to . enter a Best Smile contest in 2010 - years before she claimed she gave . up her Amish life to move to the city. She is pictured on her wedding day in a ceremony that is not traditionally Mennonite. The apparent betrayal by the creators of Breaking Amish is documented on a Facebook page, Breaking Amish the Truth, on which people who claim to know the cast have vented their anger. Scores of people have also uploaded photographs showing the cast in their 'real' lives. In . response to the outrage, TLC said it would address the revelations . in time, which it has now attempted to do with the two-part finale. 'There is a lot of information . floating around about the group featured on Breaking Amish. Much of it . is not true, but some of it is - and is addressed in upcoming episodes,' TLC told Variety.

'You cannot exclude that someone could . launch bags in the sea. We are not in the condition now to exclude any . other option,' he said. Verna said he will fly to Venezuela next week and try to advance plans to hire a boat to search for the missing plane. Baltus said the two bags found in Bonaire are expected to be sent shortly to authorities in Venezuela.

Mrs Phillips was last night being held in a Dougherty County jail, and the arrest follows her reportedly splitting from Phillip's father, Phillip Phillips Sr., last week. The arrest and break-up are likely to heap further strain on Phillip's troubled relationship with his parents. Last November, Phillip was said to have refused his family's pleas for financial help, as they struggled to pay mounting debts. His parents, who had run Albany Sporting Goods and Pawn Shop for 24 years, were upset because they had spent a lot of money travelling to support of their son when he was competing on American Idol.

The arrest also heaps more stress on the young pop star, who underwent gruelling six-hour surgery to remove troubling kidney stones last summer. The singer suffers from a congenital kidney condition, which causes painful kidney stones to build up in his kidney. They're too large to pass and he must have them surgically removed. The surgery last year was his ninth one for the complicated medical problem.","Phillip Phillips' mother Sheryl failed a roadside sobriety test in Georgia .

Notoriety: Richardson, pictured in 2007, was thought to have earned millions through his notorious gang's operations but left an estate worth just £21,000 . Infamous London gang leader and rival to the Kray twins Charlie Richardson left an estate worth only £21,000 after his death. The leader of the notorious 'Torture Gang' was thought to have earned millions from the racketeering crime empire he operated with brother Eddie in the 1960s. Richardson - a heavy smoker- suffered from emphysema for years but he died in September aged 78 from what is understood to have been blood poisoning following a perforated gall . bladder. But records show that despite his criminal enterprise - that included fraud, protection and gambling rackets - the gangster left only a paltry sum to his second wife Veronica, 58. Richardson, from Snodland, Kent, did not leave a will but intestacy rules state that the small amount will pass to Veronica. The father of six was one of the last of a . generation of underworld faces from the 1960s who have passed into . criminal folklore. His trial at the Old Bailey shocked the nation, as details of how his gang tortured and intimidated their opposition were revealed in shocking detail. While Richardson controlled large swathes of South London with his brother, the Kray twins held East London using similar techniques, and the gangs fought vicious turf wars. Richardson was arrested on the day England won the World Cup in 1966 and . his trial heard how he sought to extract information . or money from his victims through, among other things, attaching . electrodes to parts of their anatomy. His gang were also claimed to have pinned victims to the floor with six inch nails and removed their toes with bolt cutters. Crime lords: Charlie Richardson (left) and brother Eddie's trademark was said to be nailing victims to the floor before removing their toes with bolt cutters . Mugshot: Charlie Richardson's trial at the Old Bailey was dubbed the 'torture trial' due to the lurid details about how his gang members intimidated their victims through the 1960s . Richardson always denied the crimes and said the details were simply used to help jail his gang, adding that he was imprisoned 'for nothing'. The judge said he had 'terrorised' those who crossed his path in a . 'vicious, sadistic' way. At the gangster's funeral in Camberwell, South-East London, a floral tribute on one of the ten bronze Jaguars in the cortege read '240DC'. The message left onlookers wondering if DC stood for direct . current - a reference to his penchant for torture by electrocution. The 250 mourners included 'Mad' Frankie Fraser, 89, who was Richardson gang's 'enforcer' in his younger days, meting . out 'dental treatment' by trying to remove teeth with pliers.

He received ten years for his part in the torture but became a minor celebrity in later life. Despite a bitter feud which meant the Richardson siblings had not spoken for 20 years, Eddie was in attendance. The service included a poem by his first wife, Ronnie, which said: . 'Many have judged him over the years, some good, some bad and said they . feared. 'But they never knew this incredible man. A legend, a father - not . gangland!' Richardson escaped from an open prison in 1980 . and fled to France, but he was arrested and returned to jail before . being allowed out on day release in 1984. Following his release in 1984, Richardson sought to become a . legitimate businessman, wrote his autobiography My Manor and had a . cameo in a film of his life.","Gang leader thought to have earned millions from criminal acts in 1960s .

She was not reported missing for almost eight hours after she was seen on CCTV leaving the hospital . A suicidal woman was found dead after walking out of a hospital while nurses ate birthday cake, an inquest heard. The body of Sally Ann Vye, 39, was discovered at the foot of cliffs at Beachy Head, Sussex, on June 20 last year, the day after she went missing. The inquest heard that Beaumont Ward, in the Bradgate Unit run by the Leicestershire . Partnership Trust in Leicestershire, was 'chaotic' while nurses celebrated a doctor's birthday. She was not reported missing until almost eight hours after she was recorded on CCTV leaving the hospital. Ms . Vye, from Leicestershire, had previously absconded and travelled to . Beachy Head but had been saved by the intervention of a local chaplaincy . team. A healthcare assistant had also allowed her to abscond on June 19 . despite needing the express permission of a registered nurse. In . giving evidence on the third day of the hearing at Leicester Town Hall, . healthcare assistant Lisa Yeomans, said yesterday: ‘It was chaotic in . the ward for the hour between 2pm and 3pm. She said she had been left to deal with 'anxious' parents virtually by herself. Ms Yeomans said: ‘Another female patient had absconded and her parents were very anxious. ‘I went looking for her with a student nurse. I reported her missing but senior nursing staff in the office were not interested. ‘They were quite jolly, eating chocolates and cake.’ She . told the hearing she had to go back three times before she got a . response. The other missing patient was found elsewhere in the ward within a few minutes. The healthcare assistant said she was also left to attend to an angry father whose son, returning to the ward after leave, did not have a bed. Ms Yeomans admitted she filled in the head count sheet and incorrectly marked that Ms Vye was on the ward at 3pm and 4pm and admitted making those mistakes as she was recorded on CCTV leaving the ward at 2.25pm. She said she correctly marked her absent each hour from 5pm until she finished duty at 9pm. But Ms Yeomans admitted that she ignored procedure and did not report Ms Vye missing to registered staff at the first opportunity. She said: ‘I had seen her dressed to go out earlier in the day and assumed she was going on accompanied leave. Delayed information: DC Patrick Coyle told the inquest a police search was hindered because of faulty record-keeping and delays in raising the alarm after Ms Vye's body was found at Beachy Head, Sussex (pictured) ‘I kept presuming she was off the ward. I don't think I told anyone at the end of the shift. ‘I presumed a senior member of staff would have known.’ She said she did not know the woman was sectioned after a suicide attempt at Beachy Head just over a week earlier. The . hearing was told the alarm was not raised until 10.20pm, when Ms Vye’s . parents phoned the ward anxious about her safety and it was discovered . she was not there. DC Patrick Coyle told the inquest a police search was hindered because of faulty record-keeping and delays in raising the alarm. He said: ‘Because of the wrong time on the log, officers scanned the CCTV to obtain a description of what she was wearing from 5pm onwards instead of from 2.25pm.’ He said the delay in raising the alarm had lost 'daylight searching' time as Sussex police were not alerted until after midnight, 14 hours after Ms Vye had absconded. The hearing had previously heard a number of accepted practices and policies had not been transferred by the Bradgate Unit staff to the Beaumont Ward when it opened in December 2011. Bradgate Unit senior manager Teresa Smith told the inquest she was satisfied that if all those practices and policies had been implemented, including staff abiding by their own professional standards, that Ms Vye would had been safe. She said if monitoring procedure had been followed correctly, a search would have been started at 3pm that day. Ms Smith agreed with Ms Vye's father, Ronald Vye, that, given the way the ward was being run at the time, his daughter could not have been protected. The inquest continues.

Behind enemy lines: Captain Cecil Leyland Riding MC parachuted into Nazi-occupied France, it was revealed in a basket full of his wartime memorabilia . The family of Cecil Leyland Riding already knew he was a war hero. He had, after all, been awarded the Military Cross for gallantry during World War Two. But what they didn't know was the true extent of his exploits, until now - thanks to the contents of a picnic basket found in his attic. The hamper, full of medals, coded maps, memoirs and photographs, has revealed that Captain Riding was in fact a founding member of the SAS. The documents show how, just days after D-Day, the 28-year-old was parachuted behind enemy lines into Nazi-occupied France - with a carrier pigeon strapped to his chest. Among his covert missions was the time he blew up train lines outside of Paris. Captain Riding described how he often had to pretend to be German to evade the enemy while he sent intelligence back to London. His incredible stories and the many medals he was awarded for courage and bravery were found in the hamper, along with his uniform, in his home in Dumfries, Galloway after his death. David Riding, nephew of Captain Riding, said the basket's contents told the real story of the heroism he never spoke of himself. He said: ‘Cecil never talked about his wartime exploits. I knew he had been awarded the Military Cross but had no idea of the details. ‘After Cecil's death, we found the memorabilia in a trunk in his loft and could piece together the story from what was there. ‘It's amazing what these young men achieved.’ Captain Riding grew up near Lockerbie, working at a factory before moving to Glasgow where he met his wife Janie. Celebrated soldier: Captain Riding was awarded the prestigious Military Cross (left), The Star (second from left), The France and Germany Star (third from left), the Defence Medal (second from right) and the War Medal (right) The real story of heroism: Captain Riding's nephew David Riding said he never spoke of his wartime missions. He said of his uncle: 'It's amazing what these young men achieved' When the war broke out, Captain Riding had been working at Garscube House near Glasgow. The estate was requisitioned by the Ministry of Works for War Use and in 1940 he joined the Coldstream Guards. A year later he was commissioned into the Highland Light Infantry. Captain Riding was one of the first 36 members of the Special Air Service (SAS) when it was formed in 1941. He was parachuted into France just three days after the Normandy Landings in 1944. Stories kept silent: Captain Riding never spoke of his incredible story but his family have pieced together his involvement in the war using the contents of the basket which included a collection of maps . Bravery and courage: The uniform of Captain Riding who parachuted into Nazi-occupied France with a carrier pigeon strapped to his chest just three days after the D-Day landings in 1944 . He remained there on special duty behind the enemy lines for three months as part of Operation Gain. Leading a team of five men, he was responsible for blowing up the Montarges to Paris train line. His missions were often fraught with danger and he escaped death on two occasions when German troops discovered the SAS camps and obliterated them. In one of the attacks, his commanding officer and two fellow soldiers were killed. He was also part of the Allied advance into Germany across the Rhine Frontier in March and April of 1945 and was also involved in Operation Doomsday, part of the liberation of Norway. 'Gallant services': The basket contained a letter of reference from SAS Col Mayne (left) providing an insight into Captain Riding's success in the army, which included several missions fraught with danger, and a photograph of his army kit (right) War tactics: Captain Riding's escape compass, which had four big holes and two smaller ones aligned on a radial line pointing North, was designed this way to save scarce metal .

He was also awarded The Star, The France and Germany Star, The Defence Medal and the War Medal.

Silk handkerchiefs were used by the Allies during WWII for coding and maps for troops and pilots to evade capture. After finishing his service, Captain Riding returned to Scotland, living near Strathdon, Aberdeenshire before taking up a post with Bombay Burma Trading Company in 1956. Along with wife Janie, the couple lived in Borneo and Burma for a number of years where he worked in forestry.

The common thread may be that “they” aren’t the problem, but . rather that YOU are.’ The newspaper reported that Miss Riggitano may have had a history of problems and tried to commit suicide at least once before. Medication, including Adderall and Klonopin, was found in her bag, according to sources. Adderall . is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . or narcolepsy, while Klonopin is used to control seizures in epilepsy . and for the treatment of panic disorder. In early January, Riggitano had a . two-day Facebook spat with Tinari over her friendship with the jewellery . designer's boyfriend, aspiring race car driver Drew Heissenbuttel.

'Everyone . who has spoken to me when i came into the picture told me all about you . and his friends had nothing good to say except you used Drew for his . money.' Tinari denied the allegations of drug use in a text message to the paper.

I don’t give two s***s about . you. I did not post anything of facebook or instagram for you to see.

A student has taken an Oxford University college to court, claiming it discriminates against poorer students. Damien Shannon, 26, said he was unable to accept a place at the university’s St Hugh’s College because he couldn’t prove he had £12,900 for his living costs. Mr Shannon, from Salford, believes the college’s admissions . policy discriminates against students who are unable to cover the 'excessive' living costs. Mr Shannon believes that St Hugh's College's financial expectations are unreasonable for poorer students . He is suing the college, claiming that the admission policy breached his 'right of access to education' under Article 2 Protocol 1 of the Human Rights Act. He claims that his place on the year-long MSc course in economic and social history course was withdrawn due to the 'arbitrary figure' set by the college. Manchester County heard how Mr Shannon, originally from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, already had £9,000 in place to cover his tuition fees when he completed his application for the 2012/13 course last January. He believes that St Hugh's have come up with an 'arbitrary' figure designed for an excessive lifestyle . He could not raise the £12,900 required to cover his living costs for a year. Peter Oldham QC, for the college, told the court that Mr Shannon had been aware when he made the application of the need to meet the financial guarantee and he’d indicated he would be able to obtain the necessary funding. He said: 'There is no indication at this stage of Mr Shannon raising any issue with the living expenses being sought. 'There were practical difficulties in getting the money together which were not to do with Mr Shannon’s socio-economic status.' Mr Shannon claims the college’s estimation of living costs include whether students have enough funds to dine in its restaurant, socialise and buy clothes and he would be able live on less money while supporting himself with part-time work. Mr Oldham said that Mr Shannon believes he can “live more cheaply than the assumptions made” but the figure for living expenses had 'not been plucked out of the air'. He said the figure was based on 'careful deliberations' between college officials and students and was not an arbitrary amount. He said: 'The figures for living expenses are rational and carefully calculated.' 'Student representatives are involved in keeping financial procedures carefully under review.' Mr Oldham also disputed whether Article 2 Protocol 1 gave Mr Shannon the right to take the college course and he claimed it was necessary for the college to have financial guarantees as places on courses were limited and students were often forced to drop out because they could no longer fund themselves. Mr Shannon, who represented himself, argued that the college’s estimation of living costs were not proportionate and the offer of places to poorer students was 'illusionary' because they would never be able to meet its financial requirements. He said: 'Somebody put it well to me . yesterday. 'Scarcity is a good reason for rationing but not a . good reason for sending poor people to the back of the queue.' He . refuted the college’s claim that his stance had become a point of . principal only when he realised he would not be able to come up with . the £14,500. Mr Shannon, who . has since taken up a position with the civil service, said there were . three key questions for the court to consider: whether the college’s . admission policy was lawful, whether it served a real need and whether . it was proportionate. St Hugh's College (pictured) claim that their standard for living costs has been carefully calculated . The court heard that the college’s estimation for living costs included items such as £453 for clothes for the year, £67 per week for meals provided by the college, and £2500 for general expenses. There was a separate amount for the costs of entrance into local nightclubs. Mr Shannon claimed that many items were optional costs which were 'to support a particular lifestyle' and could not be considered part of normal living expenses. He is not seeking damages in the case but a judgement which forces the college to change its policy. The college sought to have the case dismissed, but judge Mr Justice Armitage said he would reserve judgement until a later date.","Damien Shannon, 26, turned down his place at St Hugh's College after he could not prove he had £12,900 for living costs .

'Troubling case': Mr Justice Cobb granted an injunction preventing the baby from being removed from the care of the health manager . Social services tried to take a baby girl away from an adoptive mother after they discovered she had been blinded by a brain tumour operation. The woman returned from hospital to find a social worker on her doorstep, ready to make a judgement on the child’s fate. Today a High Court judge stopped social workers from removing the baby until there is a full court decision, calling the case ‘troubling’. He also criticised the unnamed London council that had tried to take the baby away. Mr Justice Cobb QC said the local authority had failed to look into the would-be mother’s state of health, to offer her any support to bring up the child while disabled, or to consider that the baby now ‘finds her home’ in the woman’s arms. The baby girl, named in court only as SB, was born 13 weeks premature in February last year, weighing only 2lb 4oz, and with a cleft palate. She was abandoned by her mother and spent many months in hospital before being placed with the adoptive mother, a single woman who works as a project manager for the NHS. At the end of last year, the woman was diagnosed with a brain tumour after she found her sight deteriorating. Leaving the child to be cared for by friends, she went into hospital where the tumour was successfully removed in surgery. But the woman was left without sight and it may never return. In court: The single health manager began legal action at the High Court when a local authority tried to remove a one-year-old baby from her care after she lost her sight . She returned from hospital in January to find the social worker waiting on her doorstep. Mr Justice Cobb said in a ruling . published yesterday that the council’s decision to take the baby away . from the woman was based on the opinions of the social worker formed on . ‘the very day when she was discharged from hospital after her . operation’. He added: ‘One can only imagine the . tumult of emotions which she must have been feeling on that day – joy . and relief to be at home and with the baby; sickening anxiety and . possibly despair at her new disability.’ The judge said the social worker had . noticed the year-old baby bat the woman’s face with her hands when the . adoptive mother failed to notice her expressions. The social worker wrote this was ‘a . small indicator of the difficulties she is most likely to face in her . efforts to build an attachment with SB’. Shortly afterwards the council told . the woman the child would be removed, threatening her with criminal . prosecution if she failed to co-operate. In his ruling, the judge said the . baby should remain with the adoptive mother for now and that her . treatment by social workers was unfair. He added: ‘Visual impairment does not of itself disqualify an adult from being a capable loving parent. ‘The ability of the woman to provide good emotional care for SB needs to be properly assessed. ‘It was not fairly assessed when the social worker visited the woman’s home so soon after her discharge  from hospital.’ The judge said that the council  had not offered practical support to the woman, despite her requests  for help. He said she depends on her friends to . cope with the baby, adding: ‘Whether this is indeed the optimal . long-term care arrangement for SB remains to be seen.’ He advised the council to provide the . support she has asked for, saying that a care assistant or nanny to . help her may be the best option.","The baby girl was born in February last year and abandoned by her mother .

Bungling council workers have ruined historic cobblestones in a picturesque market town for the second time with clumsily painted yellow lines. People living in Stamford, Lincolnshire - dubbed 'England's most attractive town' by poet John Betjeman - were horrified when they first discovered the messy lines smeared across the stones in St Mary's Place last November. The paint had ran into the cracks of the stones - which were laid in the Georgian era - leaving them covered in unsightly, thick, yellow dollops. Failed again: People complained to Lincolnshire County Council after it attempted to paint yellow lines on the cobblestones in November (left). However, its second attempt (right) has not been much better . Highway workers from Lincolnshire County Council were forced to remove the first set of wobbly lines after a string of complaints. But just two months later, the replacement lines have also failed to stick to the cobbles - leaving another mess on the town's important landmark. Red-faced council workers used an experimental paint for the second job but it started peeling within a week. James Tweedle, 33, who lives nearby, said: 'It's absolute incompetence from the council. 'Surely if you get professionals in they should realise that liquid will run around obstacles like cobbles? Messy: Residents were furious after council workers ruined the Georgian cobbled streets in Stamford with clumsily painted yellow lines. Staff at Lincolnshire County Council were forced to remove them .

'Stamford is known for its old-fashioned cobbled streets but these people have made us a laughing stock. It looks ridiculous.' Liz Heesom, 20, who lives in the town, added: 'This beautiful medieval church precinct has been spoiled by the careless and unsightly ladling out of thick yellow paint. 'It's bad enough messing it up once but twice is unforgivable.' Ruined: Stamford residents say the yellow paint has destroyed the historic streetscape twice . Tourist favourite: Visitors flock to the historic market town all year round, drawn by the period architecture and specialist shops. But residents say the messy yellow lines ruin the pretty Stamford street . Brian Thompson, head of Highways West at Lincolnshire County Council, has since been forced to apologise to the people of Stamford. He said: 'We know that Stamford's cobbled streets are an important landmark for its residents and visitors alike. 'We also want to protect its appearance by ensuring that parking restrictions are enforced in the area. 'However, applying the usual methods of laying yellow lines with liquid paint is difficult on this tricky surface. 'We used these lines as a trial to assess their durability here. 'As it hasn't worked, we're already looking into alternative solutions and will get these in place as soon as we possibly can.' The BBC filmed George Eliot's Middlemarch in the town, which was also the setting for scenes in Another Country, starring Rupert Everett and Colin Firth. Stamford's George Hotel was an important coaching inn in the 17th and 18th centuries and still enjoys huge popularity with visitors today.

His family are now suing Pi Kappa Alpha . The family of a Northern Illinois University freshman who died of alcohol poisoning after an initiation party is suing the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house. David Bogenberger, 19,  was found dead in a bunk bed on November 2, 2012. He had five times the legal driving limit of alcohol in his blood. The student's father, Gary Bogenberger, filed a lawsuit against the fraternity's national organization on Thursday. As reported by the Chicago Tribune, Bogenberger alleges that the leaders of the Eta Nu chapter made heavy drinking a condition of membership and encouraged his son to consume 'excessive and dangerous amounts of alcohol.' The lawsuit claims that the national organization of Pi Kappa Alpha failed to make sure that its chapters were warned about the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption. The father also alleges that the organization did not make enough effort to ensure the chapter at Northern Illinois followed its hazing policies. 'The national organization has a . responsibility to provide meaningful training, supervision and oversight . to its local chapters, so that fraternity members understand that . alcohol-related hazing is ... potentially deadly,' the Bogenberger . family lawyer Peter Coladarci said. Twenty two university students are also facing charges following the death of a freshman who died after downing vodka in the hazing ceremony. Bogenberger had to answer a series of questions at Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity in Northern Illinois University in exchange for alcohol in a two-hour ritual on November 1. The attorney of David's family told the Chicago Tribune the finance major just 'wanted to be liked'. Five leaders of the fraternity were charged in November with felony hazing by DeKalb County authorities. A further 17 members face misdemeanor charges. The fraternity stopped operating following David's death. The initiation was part of an annual ritual dubbed 'parents night' where new recruits are assigned to senior members and encouraged to drink excessive quantities of alcohol. David, from Palatine, Cook County, had made a pledge to the house so he could make friends. Fun-loving: David Bogenberger, pictured holding the sign right, was found dead at Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house at Northern Illinois University . Coladarci . told the Tribune: 'He wanted to be accepted. It's a classic case of a . kid who just wants to fit in with the group.' Fraternity . president Alexander M. Jandick, 21; vice president James P Harvey, 21; . pledge adviser Omar Salameh, 21; secretary Patrick W Merrill, 19, and . event planner Steven A Libert have all been charged with felony hazing. If convicted they face up to three years in jail or probation. In a statement released by police in November, David's family said they want to see 'significant change'. It . read: 'We have no desire for revenge. We must realize that young people . can and do die in hazing rituals. Alcohol-involved hazing and . initiation must end.' The student's family said they want to see 'significant changes' after his death at Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house . Northern Illinois University, pictured, has also brought disciplinary charges . Mr Coladarci said the family are not seeking an 'eye for an eye' but said such college campus hazing incidents are a 'national health epidemic'. Police have accused the fraternity leaders had deliberately not told campus officials about the party so they would not be subject to inspections. Lieutenant Jason Leverton, of the DeKalb Police Department, said the group 'knowingly' did not register the event because of the quantity of alcohol they planned to consume. Mr Coladarci said one of the students, believed to be facing charges, call David's family to express his regret. Temporary sanctions have been placed on the fraternity by the university. The university has also announced disciplinary charges against 31 members, who are accused of breaking the student code of conduct.","David Bogenberger, 19, died after ritual at Northern Illinois University .

Mr Braninski, a Romanian national, suffered traumatic injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene on the north-bound carriageway between the A684 and the A172. The collision involved a Skoda Octavia, which was stationary at the side of the road with a puncture in one of its tyres, and a Ford Fiesta driven by Noble. Mr Braninski, a passenger in the Skoda, was standing behind the vehicle while the wheel was being changed when the Fiesta collided with him and pushed the Skoda into a field at the side of the road. Police secured clear evidence that Noble was using a mobile phone to exchange text messages with a friend. As well as receiving three years’ imprisonment, Noble was also disqualified from driving for six years and will have to take an extended driving test. Traffic Sergeant John Lumbard, of North Yorkshire Police’s roads policing group, said: 'Susan Noble has fully accepted that she is responsible for the tragic death of Mr Braninski due to a serious error of judgment. Noble has been jailed for three years for the collision on the A19 near Northallerton .

Research from around the world has shown time and time again that this behaviour does cause drivers to lose concentration on the road ahead. 'Ideally you should turn phones off while you are driving so that you are not distracted by an unexpected call. However, if you must use a phone while on the move, it is essential that you use a hands-free kit.

Honda is to axe 800 jobs – a quarter of its UK workforce – blaming a collapse in demand for cars across Europe. The Japanese firm’s first ever compulsory cull of employees was described by unions as ‘a hammer blow’ and by ministers as ‘a bitter disappointment’. Staff at the factory in Swindon were told the news as they arrived for work today. Axed: Workers such as those on the Honda Civic production line in Swindon were told of the Japanese car giants plan to cut 800 jobs as they arrived for work (file picture) Honda builds the Jazz, Civic and CR-V models in Swindon. About 150,000 vehicles were rolled out last year, a third of which are sold in the UK with the rest exported, mainly to Europe.

The redundancies mark a dramatic U-turn for Honda, which recently announced almost £300million of investment to boost production in Swindon  and a year ago took on 500 extra workers. The firm says UK sales rose 7 per cent last year but its anticipated rise in demand did not materialise in Europe, where sales fell by 8 per cent. Ken Keir, executive vice-president of Honda Motor Europe, said: ‘Sustained low demand in European markets make it necessary to realign our business structure. As such, Honda will enter into formal consultation [with its employees] to consider these changes and the proposal that it will reduce the workforce by 800 by the spring.’ The Unite union said the firm was cutting 420 managers and supervisors, and 360 production workers, and that when a recent cull of 325 temporary workers is included the true level of job cuts was more than 1,100. Unite national officer Tony Murphy said: ‘This is a hammer blow to UK manufacturing and to Swindon where Honda is a major employer. 'The reality is that over 1,000 jobs are going at Honda. It is a disaster for manufacturing in the UK and for the local economy.’ He also warned there would be ‘a significant knock-on impact’ on supply firms and services.

Tragedy: Alistair Mathie, 67, was hit by the blades after jumping out to allow a student to fly solo . A flying instructor may have been dazzled by the sun before he stumbled into a whirling propeller and was killed, an inquest heard. Former RAF pilot Alistair Mathie, 67, was hit by the rotating blades after jumping out of a plane at Tibenham airfield near Diss, Norfolk, to allow a student to fly solo during a lesson. He died instantly from massive head injuries, the inquest in Norwich heard. His widow Dorothy said he had decades of flying experience and she did not believe he had mistakenly stepped into the propeller of the Piper Cub J3C-65 light aircraft. Mrs Mathie, who lived with her husband in Burgate, Suffolk, said in a statement: 'The sun was very bright and low that day, and it would have been full in his face. 'The most likely explanation, I believe, is that he was dazzled and disorientated by the sun. He stumbled on the wheel and stepped into the propeller while trying to get his balance.' An Air Accidents Investigation Branch report published last October, after the accident on January 28, suggested that Mr Mathie might not have heard the propeller because he was wearing headphones. It also suggested he might not have seen the propeller, even though the tips of the blades were different colours. Finally, it said that the wind produced by the working engine when the aircraft was stationary was not particularly strong and he might not have felt it. The report stated the accident illustrated the importance of pilots following a path along the edge of the wing when approaching or leaving an aircraft to ensure safe clearance. Robert Weller, Mr Mathie’s student on the day of the tragedy, described him as one of the most experienced pilots he knew. He said he saw Mr Mathie, a Light Aircraft Association coach, climb out of the aircraft at and they then had a brief conversation. Shocking: Mr Mathie died instantly from massive head injuries after he was hit by the plane's propellers at Tibenham Airfield in Norfolk . He added: 'He turned towards the front of the aircraft. The next thing I knew the engine had stopped. I really had no idea what had happened.' Another pilot, Michael Nice, said he was about 100 yards away from the scene. He said: 'The aeroplane was stationary. I noticed the door/window open and Al getting out. I waited to watch Rob Weller’s first circuit. 'When Al got out of the aircraft he turned and walked away. He walked towards the front of the aircraft and he made contact with the propeller.' AAIB investigator Nicholas Dann told the inquest that it was impossible to confirm the exact cause of the accident. Unexplained death: Mr Mathie's widow Dorothy said he had decades of flying experience and she did not believe he had mistakenly stepped into the propeller of the Piper Cub J3C-65 light aircraft (stock image) He said there was some debate about whether the engine of a stationary aircraft should be turned off or left on for safety reasons if it was about to fly again. If it was turned off, it would have to be restarted by hand which carried some risk as it would then entail someone having to hand-start the propeller to start it up again. He said of 15 previous air accidents involving propellers, ten had been caused by them being hand-started, and five by the engine being left on. A post-mortem examination found that the cause of death was severe head injuries as a result of being hit by an aeroplane propeller. Norfolk Coroner William Armstrong recorded a verdict of accidental death. Mr Mathie had a total of 14,709 hours' flying experience. He flew Jaguar fighter jets during a 30-year career with the RAF and later became a civilian pilot for Thomas Cook before retiring. Dead at the scene: The pensioner had flown Jaguar fighter jets (pictured) during a 30-year career with the RAF and later became a civilian pilot for Thomas Cook . Speaking at the time of his death, Peter Gill, secretary of the International Auster Club, said Mr Mathie was ‘the best of the best’ in the flying world. Mr Gill, 67, said: 'I cannot believe what has happened. I am gutted. Al was a highly skilled pilot. If you were going to fly with somebody he was the man you would choose. 'He was very well respected all over the world - I have received tributes from Brazil, South America, Australia and New Zealand from people who knew Al. 'l taught his wife Dot to fly. They keep their own Auster plane on their farm - it was Al’s pride and joy.'","Alistair Mathie, 67, was hit by the blades after jumping out of a plane .

The new Bentley Continental GT Speed cabriolet can hit 60mph in just 4 seconds and 100mph in just over 9 seconds – all with the top down. And it will be in UK showrooms this Spring with a price of £160,000 following its official global unveiling at this month’s Detroit Motor Show in the USA on January 14. 'Designed for those who accept no compromise': The new Bentley Continental GT Speed is the world's fastest four-seater convertible with a top speed of 202mph . New launch: The Bentley Continental GT Speed will be on sale in the UK with a £160,000 price tag this spring . It described the new car as its ‘performance flagship convertible’. Bentley chairman and chief executive Dr Wolfgang Schreiber said: 'The new GT Speed Convertible will appeal to drivers who seek the sensory thrills of the world’s fastest four-seat soft-top and the practicality of a year-round Grand Tourer, together with unrivalled levels of luxury and refinement. 'It is designed for those who accept no compromise.' Bentley is based in Crewe, Cheshire, where it employs 4,000 people, builds more than 6,000 cars a year and exports £500m of vehicles abroad, including to China, the USA and the Middle East. It is  now owned by German car-giant Volkswagen. A Bentley spokesman said: ’The new GT Speed Convertible combines the sensory pleasures of roof-down luxury touring with  shattering performance. ‘And in true Bentley style, no compromises have been made in craftsmanship, luxury or refinement to deliver this unrivalled performance.’ Super-charged: The Bentley Continental GT Speed is powered by a 6.0litre twin turbo-charged W12 engine with 616 brake horse-power - the equivalent of six Ford Fiestas . Driving in the fast lane: The cabriolet can reach 60mph in just 4 seconds and 100mph in just over 9 seconds with the top down . The new car promises ‘the thrill of the open road, 365 days a year’. It offers the luxury and refinement of a coupé yet transforms into a head-turning open tourer at the touch of a button as the four-layer hood. It has been ‘exhaustively tested’ in all conditions from -30°C to +50°C or more: ’It resists even monsoon-force rain and maintains comfortable, draught-free warmth even on the coldest days. ‘ . It even features a warm-air ‘neck warmer’ to make open air driving ‘an appealing and comfortable prospect even on the cooler days of spring and autumn'.

The Bentley spokesman noted: ‘With . the hood down, the Continental GT Speed convertible offers sensational . performance with the sensory amplification of open-air motoring. Hood . up, it’s as practical a year-round proposition as its coupé stablemate.’ ‘It is a Bentley that can tackle sun-drenched boulevard or snowy alpine pass with equal aplomb.’ It is propelled along the road by a giant 6.0 litre twin turbo-charged  W12 engine developing 616brake horse-power – equivalent to about six Ford Fiestas – linked to an eight speed automatic gear-box. Permanent all-wheel drive means it sticks to the road like glue while the powerful engine means it  provides  ‘effortless, refined performance at all times’. And although it delivers a 15 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency, don’t hold your breath for low running costs. It still only manages a gas-guzzling average 19 miles to the gallon  - dropping to 12mpg around town, thought it does creep up to 27mpg when cruising. Outside with its muscular stance, the winged ‘B’ badge set upon a black enamel backgroundcrowns the radiator shell. It has exclusive 21-inch alloy wheels, dark-tint grilles and ‘rifled’ exhaust  pipes. Bentley promises  enhanced performance accentuated ‘by a glorious baritone snarl from the free-breathing exhaust.’ Inside its four-seat handcrafted cabin, the GT Speed convertible features styling by Mulliner which blends contemporary luxury with a sporting character and distinctive diamond-quilted hide upholstery, as well as exclusive tread-plates featuring the ‘Speed’ legend. For safety the  Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system helps keep the beast on the road at speed. However for an even more engaging drive, switching the gear selector to ‘Sport’ mode delivers an even  sharper throttle response, gear-shifting at higher engine speeds and jumps back down through the gears – directly from 8th to 4th fear for instance -  to provide  accessible acceleration.

The City of Dallas has begun tearing down a run-down building where Lee Harvey Oswald briefly lived before the . assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Now the bulldozers have moved in to raze the building in the same year that Dallas is officially commemorating the killing for the first time. President Kennedy was shot on November 22 1963. Bulldozers demolish the dilapidated building where Lee Harvey Oswald briefly lived prior to assassinating President Kennedy in 1963 . A city worker cuts a chain link fence surrounding the apartment complex prior to demolition on Monday . Owner Jane Bryant was emotional about seeing the building being demolished. She told the LA Times that she hadn't known that the process had begun until she was informed by a reporter. 'The city of Dallas told me if I was . making progress on the building, they would stop it,' Bryant said. 'They agreed to give me more time.' The owner had been trying to salvage the valuable and historic parts of the building that was built in 1925. She believed she had around two weeks left. Bryant has already sold the toilet and bathtub from Oswald's old apartment but wanted to remove the old pine and white oak from the property. Crumbling: The disheveled apartment was uninhabited and had a number of building code violations. She told the LA . Times that she was trying to contact her lawyer to file a restraining . order to stop the demolition, and that police on Monday had refused to . let her into the building. Bryant . was worried that scavengers would begin to break up the building as it . was being taken down by the city 'People are going to be in there . tonight stealing,' she said. Bryant . was never able to realize her plans to renovate the building in the Oak . Cliff area of Dallas after buying it in 2007, and the next year got . caught up in litigation with the city over the state of the building at . 600 Elsbeth St. 'We're not just losing a piece . of fundamental history to Dallas related to the assassination, we're . also losing a piece of fundamental architecture to this area,' said . Bryant. Demolition begins on the 1925 apartment building . The apartment, where Oswald . lived from November 1962 to March 1963 with his wife, Marina, and young . daughter, is mentioned in the Warren Commission report, which . investigated the president's death. The report concluded that Oswald . acted alone on Nov. 22, 1963, when he fired at Kennedy's motorcade from . the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, as it passed by . Dealey Plaza. Oswald then killed Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit 45 minutes after Kennedy was shot, according to the report. Oswald was arrested in the hours after the assassination, but was killed two days later by nightclub owner Jack Ruby. The . apartment where Oswald lived had the address of 604 Elsbeth St. in . 1963. It was apartment No. 2. The residence was one of several in the . area where he lived after returning to the U.S. from Russia in June . 1962. Oswald lived in apartment number 2. The building's owner has sold off a number of things from his home, including the toilet . He can't hold a job for very long. He's . moving around quite a bit, can't get settled, breaks off relations with . his brother and mother soon after coming back.

Preziosi, executive director of Preservation Dallas, noted that there . are more important buildings associated with Oswald than the Elsbeth .

After leaving the Elsbeth Street . apartment, Oswald moved a few blocks away, to Neely Street - where the . famous pictures were taken of him posing in the backyard holding the . rifle used in the assassination. He was living at a boarding house in . the same area but on Beckley Avenue when Kennedy was assassinated. A police officer and a worker prepare to tear down the historic building . The owner said that by demolishing the apartment, they are losing a piece of history . Gary . Mack, curator of the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, said Oswald . ordered the revolver that killed Tippit in January, when he was living . at the Elsbeth apartment, but notes that 'the most important parts of . the Oswald story are what he did, not where he did them.' 'One . has to draw the line somewhere at what is or is not historically . significant. For those studying Oswald's life, this may be a more . important address, but for those who are curious about the Kennedy . assassination, what actually happened in Dealey Plaza is of far more . significance,' Mack said. Bryant didn't know . of the site's link to history until the year after she bought it.

The Dogs Trust pledges never to destroy a healthy dog. But as its Christmas ban on rehoming – introduced to stop pets being given as unwanted presents – comes  to an end, the charity is desperate to find new homes for its animals. The Dogs Trust says it is busier than ever because the recession has forced people to give up their pets for economic reasons. Last year, 12,822 dogs were rehomed, up 7.6 per cent on 2011. ‘Sometimes owners just can’t afford to care for their dog any more and call us, but there are also a lot of cases where someone has to downsize to smaller or rented accommodation and can’t keep a dog any more,’ said a spokesman. Emma Taylor, of the Dogs Trust rehoming centre in Harefield, Middlesex, said the charity undertakes stringent tests to make sure families and their homes are suitable. She said: ‘When someone comes looking for a dog, we make sure they bring the whole family and meet the dog at least twice. We also arrange a home visit to ensure their home is suitable. It takes about ten days. ‘We also advise people that if they’ve got a house move or a new baby on the way, they should wait until after that,  so everything’s settled down before they take a new dog.’ To enquire about any of the dogs pictured here from Harefield, call 01895 453930.

Understanding: Equalities Minister Helen Grant, 50, said in her local newspaper column that she 'sympathised' with families who cannot move or sell . An MP who claimed £20,000 a year for a London flat despite having a £1.8million home in nearby Surrey has complained that she is struggling to sell her house. Equalities Minister Helen Grant moaned that she has been trying to sell the sprawling pile in Kingswood, near Reigate for two years without success. In a local newspaper column certain to rile some readers, the Tory MP for Maidstone, Kent, wrote: 'I shudder to think of the effects on the stagnant property market. 'Having tried to sell a house and then buy here in Kent since October 2010, I sympathise with the thousands of others who cannot move or sell.' It is uncertain whether her sympathy will be returned, after she became embroiled in the expenses row in November for claiming the maximum second-home allowance to cover rent on a London flat. This was despite the fact that her house is too close to Westminster for her to qualify for the second-home allowance. Mrs Grant managed to claim it because her Maidstone constituency, which is more than 40 miles from the family home, is outside the expenses ‘exclusion zone’. The Surrey MP in whose constituency she . lives – Tory Crispin Blunt – makes the same journey as Mrs Grant into . the Commons, but is barred from claiming expenses for a second home in London. Mrs Grant, who was recently reprimanded . for altering an employee’s contract to cut his sick pay, said she was . ‘fully entitled’ to make the claims. The 50-year-old, who entered Parliament at the 2010 General Election by winning Ann Widdecombe’s old seat, plans to buy a new home in Kent after selling her Edwardian property. Developers thinking of buying the lawyer's house have submitted two planning applications to demolish it and replace it with three four-bedroom homes. The first application was withdrawn . and the second, for seven apartments and one detached house on the site, . is the subject of an appeal, after it was rejected in July 2012. Mrs Grant said the property, which sits on a 0.39 hectare site, had been on the market since October 2010. Luxurious: Kingsworthy House, home of Tory MP Helen Grant. It is just 19 miles from Parliament . Plush: The home is worth £1.8million and is in the highly desirable market town of Reigate in Surrey . She added in her column: 'Low or stable rates are at least containing the problem, and that is a coalition success in my book.' Her controversial expense claims were revealed in a . Channel 4 Dispatches documentary in November, which investigated the . latest intake of MPs following the row that erupted in 2009. Mrs Grant, who was the first black . woman selected to defend a Tory seat, became a Minister in the September . reshuffle when she took on the dual roles of Justice Minister and Women . and Equalities Minister. Second home: Helen Grant's Thameside flat, beside MI6's headquarters, costs taxpayers £20,000 a year . The . Channel 4 investigation discovered that Mrs Grant, who draws more than . £26,000 a year from the solicitors’ firm she established in addition to . her £97,000 pay as MP and Minister, does not have her own home in her . Kent constituency. She rents a flat in Vauxhall next to MI6’s headquarters while . basing herself in Kingswood, 19 miles from Westminster. When vising her . constituency in Maidstone and the Weald, she stays at her mother’s home, . in nearby Sutton Valence. The lawyer, regarded as a fast-rising . Conservative star, has also said she may close her office in Maidstone . when its lease expires. She has charged taxpayers the maximum £1,666 a month since starting to rent her Thameside property in March. A spokesman for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which oversees MPs’ expenses, said in November that Mrs Grant had acted within the rules on second homes. He added that it was ‘up to MPs to exercise their judgment as to how they claim their expenses’. A spokeswoman for Mrs Grant said: ‘Mrs Grant’s constituency has been deemed by IPSA to be a non-London constituency and she is therefore fully entitled to use her rental accommodation allowance either in London or in the constituency.’ Earlier the same month, her constituency assistant Tony Williams said he was disgusted after she altered his contract to cut his sick pay when he needed time off for a heart condition. Mr Williams’s contract said he was allowed up to two weeks’ sick pay – instead of the 26 weeks he was entitled to receive. Mrs Grant claimed the sick pay was docked to give taxpayers a ‘fairer deal’, but the Commons authorities said his contract should not have been altered.","MP Helen Grant said her Surrey house had been on the market for two years .

At ground level there is nothing out of the ordinary about the former Atlas E missile base in Dover, Kansas. But delve below the surface and beyond the military detritus and you will soon discover a subterranean wonderland.

Luxury: The decadent interior of the former military bunker in Dover, Kansas, which Edward Peden has lived in with his family for the past 30 years . Going underground: A pillar marks the existence of Mr Peden's underground home, which he spent 12 years working on . Where once there was a cutting-edge missile ready to be deployed at the height of the Cold War, there are now homely rugs, sofas and even a few bongos. The former schoolteacher purchased the 37 acre site in 1983 for $48,000, converting one third of the 18,000 square feet silo into a living space for his family. When he initially drove out to investigate the area, near his hometown of Topeka, Kansas, most of the concrete tunnel labyrinth was flooded with rainwater. Not put off by what lay below him, Mr Peden undressed to his shorts, climbed below ground level using a rope ladder and swam in between the different chambers. The Topeca base, opened in 1961, was one of dozens of gigantic underground bases built by the U.S. Government during the Cold War. The hardy structures were designed to withstand nuclear attack, housing specialist weaponry themselves.

The base, however, was quickly decommissioned when the weapons became outdated and it was decided that the missile bay doors took too long to open. Since its closure, the base lay empty - until Mr Peden purchased the site. Examining the chamber, Mr Peden said: 'There was an Atlas missile here. Every home should have one, right? 'A 47 ton door would open and . they could back a large semi truck in here with a missile, and then the . missile that was lying horizontal here would be drawn upward, erected, . and then it would be fueled, ready for launch.' The missile was over . seven stories tall and ten times more powerful than the atomic bombs . dropped on Japan.

Some home sellers leave behind light fittings and loo seats when they move but one family was lucky enough to find an ancient relic worth £50,000 in their new house. The 8ft long carved granite Buddhist temple step was found in the garden of a property which was once owned by a tea planter who had brought it back from Sri Lanka years ago. Weighing nearly a ton, it was thought to have been too heavy and cumbersome for the previous homeowner to move so he left it behind. Ancient: This 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple step, worth £50,000, is being sold at auction after it was discovered by a family when they moved into their bungalow . Experts believe that the six-inch . thick step, which is covered in intricate and beautiful animal carvings, . could be up to 1,300 years old. It is just one of seven temple steps from the ancient Sri Lankan city of Anuradhapura left in existance today. The step is now owned by an unidentified woman who has kept it outside the front door of her bungalow home near Exeter, Devon, for people to walk on. However, she is now selling it at auction as she is downsizing and, like the previous owner, is unable to  take it with her. The popularity of ancient Eastern art has greatly increased in recent years and the step is expected to sell for a £30,000 to £50,000 when it goes on sale at an auction. Sam Tuke, of auctioneers Bonhams, said that the vendor could remember playing on the step as a child after her parents bought the family home from the tea planter in the 1950s. She had inherited the bungalow after her father died, and with it the step. 'The woman came in to our office to collect an item and mentioned in passing this large slab of carved granite that she had,' said Mr Tuke. Relic: Despite once adorning a Sri Lankan temple the intricately carved step has since been marking the end of a concrete path outside a bungalow in Sussex . 'She arranged to drop a photograph into me the next day. 'When I saw it I knew it could be of great historical interest and importance. 'The step had come from her mother's house in Sussex that the family had bought from a tea planter in the 1950s. 'I think it is a fair assumption that . this person brought it back from Sri Lanka and couldn't be bothered to . move it and take it with him when he sold the property. 'It probably wasn't of much value then. At the time British antiques and Chippendale furniture were where the money was. The city has been awarded a UNESCO World Heritage Site status. It lies 205 km north of the capital Colombo, on the banks of the historic Malvathu Oya. It is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and one of the country's eight World Heritage Sites. The sacred city was established around a cutting from the 'tree of enlightenment', the Buddha's fig tree. It was brought there in the 3rd century B.C. by Sanghamitta, the founder of an order of Buddhist nuns. Anuradhapura, a Ceylonese political and religious capital that flourished for 1,300 years, was abandoned after an invasion in 993. It was left hidden in dense jungle but now its palaces, monasteries and monuments, is now accessible to visitors once again. Source: UNESCO . 'The vendor played on it as a child and remembered running her fingers around the animals carved into the stone. 'It has been lying outside the front of her bungalow at the end of a concrete path and she has called it ""The Pebble"". 'She is now downsizing and can't take the step with her which is why she is selling it. 'It is in amazing condition considering its age.' The magnificent work of art features a procession of animals including lions, horses, elephants, birds and Brahim cows carved into it. Alice Bailey, head of Islamic and Indian art at Bonhams, said: 'It is a truly wonderful find and one of great importance. 'Identical temple steps can be seen in situ in early 19th century photographs of the monuments of Sri Lanka and the condition and quality of the carving are superb. 'It is a museum piece.' The city of Anuradhapura is the greatest monastic city of the ancient world that dates from the middle of the 5th century BC. It is today a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ms Bailey said that she believed that the step could be up to 1,300 years old. 'It is quite difficult to age,' she said. 'It . is from the Anuradhapura period which was from 400BC to 1017AD, . although it is more than likely to date from the eighth or ninth . century. 'It is a temple step that was used at the bottom of staircases and entrances to temple complexes. 'The . carvings are a standard frieze of animals which date from that period. 'They symbolise the four stages life; growth, energy, power and . forbearance. 'The step is a bit mossy because it has been outside for quite a long time but we are going to get it cleaned up.' The step is due to be sold at auction in London on April 23.","Ancient temple step was left behind by previous owner as it was too heavy to move .

British comedian Harry Enfield has upset his Primrose Hill neighbours with plans to turn a local pub into a £3 million house for him and his family . Comedian Harry Enfield’s plans to convert a pub into a £3million family home have angered his neighbours. He bought the Queens last year with the intention of living upstairs while a friend ran a restaurant downstairs. But he wrote to neighbours saying the plan was not financially viable and he would convert the whole building into house. Former regulars at the pub, in Primrose Hill, North London, said the conversion would ruin the ‘strong sense of community’ on the street, while a local councillor called the move a ‘tragic loss’. Mr Enfield and his wife Lucy, a designer, currently live in West London and bought the property with the intention of moving when their three children – aged 15, 13 and nine - finish school. In a letter to local residents, Mr Enfield, 51, pointed out that his family had lived in the area for years. The actor, who famously played Kevin the Teenager and Wayne the Slob, said: ‘I have been a resident of Primrose Hill since 1988, my family since 1929.’ If the council did not grant permission for the change of use to a home he would consider other options, he said, but warned ‘every other option would take time and stretch us financially’. He added: ‘There are two other pubs within 50 yards, four other pubs within 150 yards and six other pubs within 300 yards, we would imagine the council might think the loss of this one not to be too great, the compensation being greater tranquillity.’ The pub’s former landlord Tony Peters, who ran it for 32 years before his retirement last year, expressed concern that Mr Enfield’s plans would change the nature of the street. Hub of the community: Locals have said the permanent closure of the Queens No 1 pub in Primrose Hill is a 'tragic loss' to the community . He told a local newspaper: ‘This is a . great little street with a sense of community. People know each other . and everyone would like it to remain a pub. It should not be changed . into a house. It plays such an important role in the area. 'Where are . people going to meet, socialise, hold their celebrations, their wakes? McDonald’s? Starbucks?  It was a good pub with a good clientele, and it . was successful.’ The pub has been closed since Mr . Peters retired and local Steve Collis said neighbours were hoping it . would be reopened under Mr Enfield’s ownership. New neighbours: Harry Enfield and his wife Lucy hope to move into the property with their three children . Not so funny now: Harry Enfield pictured performing his Considerably Richer Than You sketch on the TV show Harry Enfield and Chums . He said: ‘Since its closure there has . been something of a sense of mourning, an unnerving silence and I am . sure that I speak for many when I say that we long for some life on the . corner.’ Primrose Hill Lib Dem councillor Chris Naylor said: ‘It is a tragic loss and people will be desperate to save it.’ The plans, filed last week, show the . building currently has a beer basement, a kitchen and external store. The home upstairs, where the former landlord lived, can be reached by a . separate entrance. The renovation would include creating a garden and extending the back of the building. Famous neighbours: Songwriter Guy Chambers who collaborated on many of Robbie Williams' hit songs, pictured left, and politician David Miliband, the brother of Labour leader Ed Miliband, both live in Primrose Hill .

A shocked homeowner told today of the terrifying moment she almost plunged down an eight foot hole which appeared overnight outside her front door. Monica Winton, 50, was popping to the shops when she nearly fell down the black hole into a mystery stream running underneath her house. The tunnel carrying the stream has gradually collapsed and the hole above has expanded to several metres wide. Gaping chasm: Graham Winton, 51, stands at his front door, just yards from hole which appeared overnight . Frightening: Monica Winton was heading to the shops when she nearly plunged down the hole . Mrs Winton, from Perthshire, Scotland, fears the gaping chasm could soon engulf her entire front porch. She said: 'It was extremely frightening. It happened on the Friday before Christmas and I was just going out to the shops when the path outside the front door suddenly gave way. 'I managed to stop myself falling and I was very fortunate not to have hurt myself. 'My husband went out and put a brush down the hole and couldn't believe how deep it was. Fears: The Wintons are worried the hole outside their front door could engulf their entire front porch . 'If it had been the postman or one of us coming home in the dark it could have been a very very serious accident. 'We've just got to hope the porch doesn't collapse next.' Mrs Winton, a home care officer at Perth and Kinross Council, who lives with husband Graham, 51, admitted she had no idea there was a burn running underneath their home of 11 years. The couple have been told the tunnel . carrying the water has burst underneath the property, which stripped . away the soil above and subsequently brought down the pathway. Heavy rain: The couple have been told a tunnel carrying the underground stream burst . It is thought it happened due to the heavy rainfall that was experienced around the country in December. Mr Winton said: 'The path is gone and the concrete pad the porch is on is floating on nothing so we're unable to use the front of the house. 'We had no idea there was a burn there and I've phoned the solicitor to check and there is nothing in the deeds about it.

The insurance company are set to assess the damage before the weekend and Mr and Mrs Winton face an anxious wait to find out if they will be able to claim for the damage. Mr Winton said: 'We're not sure which way to turn now and are waiting for the insurance company getting back to us. 'The insurance did say they would . cover it but I had changed insurer at the start of December and it . reverts back to the previous company because the claim came within eight . weeks of me changing.'

Thanks to Malissa’s skills as a 3D artist the pair were able to designed it themselves and make a virtual version of their future home, ahead of grabbing hammer and drill. ‘We just had some basic shop class skills from High School’, Malissa Tack explains on their website. Simple is good: Chris and Malissa Tack traded in the busy life for what they think is the good one - as small as it may seem . Welcome inside: As you enter the Tiny Tack House you walk straight into the living room and office with the bathroom on the left, and the sleeping loft above it and the small kitchen . Cramped kitchen: The couple say living small has made them more considerate and a better couple as there is no way squeezing past unnoticed in the kitchen . Ready, steady, cook: Although the pair relied on professional advice regarding electricity and plumbing, they installed it all themselves . ‘The work was done by Chris and myself. There was a few days where the parents flew in to help out with the roof. ‘We had advice help with the electrical and plumbing from a certified person. ‘Just about everyone we know thought we were crazy, but now, everyone loves the idea of the house!' The . house has four solar panels and is supplied by a 40 gallon fresh water . tank, making it environmentally, as well as financially, friendly. Meals on wheels: The pair fit their entire lives, work, sleep and eat in this petite cottage . Picturesque: The house has all the components of a dream home - although some may struggle with the size . The green stuff: The Tiny Tack House is parked on rented land and is partly powered by four solar panels . A . mere six months after the pair moved in to the Tiny Tack House they . reaped further benefit from their downsizing as Chris lost his job as a . ‘lead creative’ at Apple. Thanks to their choice to live small, . they are able to ride out the storm as both maintenance and building . costs were relatively low. The . Tacks expect to have paid it off completely within two-three years and . keep costs to bills and rent of the land where the Tiny Tack House is . parked. Nighty, night: The sleeping loft is located underneath the roof above the kitchen and bathroom . Looking down: A birds-eye view of the Tiny Tack House from the sleeping loft shortly after it was finished . Cat not included: The pair are now devoting a lot of their time to the tiny homes movement helping others in their bid to downsize and build their own home . Handy work: The married couple have built everything in the Tiny Tack House themselves (apart from the iMac double-functioning as a television) Back to nature: Despite working in high-tech fields, Malissa as a 3D animation artist and Chris previously at Apple, they wanted a simpler life outside their professions . ‘Without the substantially lower cost of living, we would be struggling financially,’ Chris Tack told the Huffington Post, . The Tacks add that living small made them stronger as a couple, and nicer to one another. The cramped situation forces them to respect the individual's right to their own space and to be more polite, as the tiny kitchen barely allows a squeeze-past.

Hungry councillors are set to lose their cheap bacon rolls after it was revealed that they were costing more than £122,000 of taxpayers' money a year. Glasgow city council chiefs will axe the subsidised buffet in the elegant City Chambers dining room to make way for a new commercial cafe. They have been under pressure for years to give up the silver-service restaurant in George Square, where they eat cheaply thanks to £122,000-a-year subsidy from the city's ancient, but depleted, Common Good Fund. Nina Baker, outside Glasgow City Chambers, says her council colleagues should pay for food and drink . The fund, which was supposedly set up for the good of the city, had been used to foot the bill for the dining room because it provided 'training' for the local authority's catering and services firm, Cordia. Now the council's Labour leaders have caved to pressure to give up the publicly-funded service, announcing plans to close it. City Treasurer Paul Rooney said: 'The buffet belongs to another era. It is no longer the best way to provide either catering for the City Chambers or training for Cordia's young staff. We asked Cordia to put together a fresh approach. 'It will be open to everyone in the building and run on a commercial basis, at no cost to the city. 'Cordia already runs similar cafes in some of our other offices, such as High Street, which have been a success.' Nina Baker, an opposition Green councillor, discovered none of the kitchen staff were qualified trainers and said the facility was a waste of Common Good money. Going: Subsidised bacon rolls for Glasgow city councillors cost taxpayers more than £10,000 a monthh . Miss Baker, who takes tea to work in a flask rather than enjoy free, subsidised hot drinks, said: 'I think the buffet is an anachronism: I don't see why anybody should subsidise my dinners or anybody else's. 'I'm glad the buffet will be replaced by a cafe that everyone who works can use.' Councillors ate for free in the buffet until 2007 when they started earning a salary.  Since then, they have made a modest contribution to the cost - in theory they pay for the ingredients while meals are cooked as a training exercise. A two-course meal is currently £3.50, with another £1 for a pudding, while coffee and tea is free. The buffet is also open for breakfasts, with a roll and sausage on the menu for 90p, and a roll and bacon for £1. Ms Baker said: 'The only place I know where you can eat as cheaply as that is a truck stop. And I should say the quality would not be the same.' A source at City Chambers said the 48-table dining room had fallen out of favour, serving only around 25 customers a day out of 79 councillors and the city's senior directors, while another source suggested the figure was closer to 12. SNP leader Graeme Hendry said: 'Closing the council buffet and turning it into a commercial cafe is a good decision. 'The current level of subsidy is not justifiable and the training benefits can be met through a commercial cafe, which will offer the kind of catering most staff want.' It is not clear when the buffet will be shut down, but councillors have already approved a subsidy of £122,000 from the Common Good Fund for the 2013-14 financial year.","Glasgow City Council's silver-service buffet is funded by public money .

It was also revealed that some hospitals have been serving patients burgers which contain horse passed off as beef. And the Whitbread chain announced that burgers and lasagne served at its Beefeater, Brewers Fayre, Table Table, Taybarns and Premier Inn hotels were contaminated. Scandal: A UK lab testing beef products says that nine out of 15 samples in one batch contained horse, as well as lamb, chicken and pork in a scandal linked to abattoirs like this one in Romania . The spread of the food fraud scandal from supermarkets into the catering sector suggests the full scale of the contamination is still to emerge. Yesterday, Lancashire County Council said that it has withdrawn pre-prepared cottage pies from 47 school kitchens. It is understood the supplier involved, Oak Farm Foods in Ireland, has been supplying the ready meals for at least the past six months. There are also suggestions that the pies and other products made by Oak Farm have been supplied to schools and other outlets across the UK and Ireland. Mary Creagh, Labour’s environment spokesman, said: ‘People will be shocked and dismayed that horsemeat has now been found in schools and hospitals. ‘David Cameron should order the FSA to speed up its testing so that we have a full picture of just how far this has spread in our communities.’ Not for sale: This Tesco Everyday Value spaghetti bolognese was withdrawn from Tesco shelves after it was also supplied with meat which came from Spanghero .

She added: ‘Suppliers and caterers should be urgently reassuring schools and parents about the action they are taking.’ Other local authorities from Staffordshire to Sheffield have removed processed beef from school meals as a precaution. It was also revealed that burgers containing horsemeat have been supplied to hospitals in Northern Ireland.

Yesterday, Paragon could not explain the presence of horse DNA, saying it ‘only buys beef from licensed and approved EU suppliers’. A spokesman said the firm supplies Whitbread with three burgers, with one testing positive for horsemeat. Three British firms were involved in supplying horsemeat-contaminated lasagne to Whitbread. The meat came from Pinnacle Foods, of Hampshire, while the dishes were made by Creative Foods, of Flint, and delivered by Brakes. A Pinnacle spokesman said: ‘As you can appreciate we are devastated by the news, and working very hard to trace back where the offending material may of come from.’ The FSA revealed yesterday that its officials raided the premises of two other English companies earlier this week as part of its investigation. David Bingham, of the health service’s Business Services Organisation, which provides meat to health trusts, said a range from a company in the Republic of Ireland had been withdrawn. A Whitbread spokesman said the chain was ‘shocked and disappointed’ to learn of the horsemeat contamination.

Nearly half of all the UK's prime time Twitter traffic is about what's happening on the television, says a new report from the social messaging web app. Figures revealed in the the Tune In with Twitter report, published yesterday, show the service's 'strongly symbiotic' relationship with what remains the dominant medium for transmitting popular culture. It claims that Twitter is increasingly acting as television viewers' 'second screen' of choice, with 60 per cent of users posting messages on the site while they are watching the box. Good clean family fun: A new report from Twitter has analysed the tweeting habits of television viewers and found 40 per cent of all tweets sent during prime time are about TV broadcasts . 'Twitter is the shortest distance between you and what interests you most,' the report said. 'This interest is expressed in a huge volume of conversation. 'Four hundred million Tweets are sent every day. As a result when events happen in the real world, they happen on Twitter. 'More and more we’re finding this is true for TV. When stand-out moments happen on TV, spikes in related conversation happen on Twitter. 'In fact, according to Second Sync, 40 per cent of all UK Twitter traffic at peak TV viewing time is about TV.' Twitter's analysis also revealed how the Tweeting habits of television viewers vary depending on the kinds of programme they are watching. It found that users were far more likely to send Tweets while they were watching factual or reality TV programmes, while they became comparatively quiet during dramas and films. According to the report, there are more than 10million active Twitter users in the UK alone, with 60 per cent using the service while watching television. Users' patterns of engagement while watching factual television programmes mirror key events or iconic moments during the broadcast, it said. Engaged: Twitter's report found users were . far more likely to send Tweets while they were watching factual programmes, like the controversial Drugs Live: The Ecstasy . Trial broadcast on Channel 4 last September... Engrossed: However during dramas like Homeland users put down their gadgets and focused on the show . However, in drama, bursts of Tweets 'bookend' the beginning and the ends of episodes, as viewers settle down to watch the storyline unfold without interruption. Reality TV 'entertainment' like Made in Chelsea have a high proportion of viewers tweeting their responses to the programmes, the report said, with as many as one in four viewers actively using Twitter while they watch. Tweets peak at the beginning of the programme and, despite further, lesser peaks, tail off as it wears on. Current affairs programmes like Panorama, on the other hand, have what the report describes as a 'long tail of engagement', with conversation on Twitter continuing long after the end of the broadcast. They also see a higher proportion of Tweets sent from desktop computers, with peaks following climactic moments in the narrative or prompts from hashtags displayed on air. Conversation starter: Current affairs programmes like Panorama have what the report describes as a 'long tail of engagement', with conversation on Twitter continuing long after the end of the broadcast . Conversation killer: Programmes like Made In Chelsea have a a high proportion of tweeting viewers, however their discussion tails off as the broadcast wears on, the report shows . Films on TV regularly trend on Twitter, according to the report, and have a unique, recurring profile with peaks following key moments in the story lines and quotes from the dialogue often tweeted widely. One section of the report dealt exclusively with last year's X Factor series, which in its first show saw double the number of related tweets as were sent at the same stage of the previous year's competition. 'X Factor generated more than 14million Tweets in 2012, driven by integration of dynamic hashtags on air, celebrity Tweets, and a passionate Twitter audience,' the report said. It also claimed that tweets had served as an accurate barometer for public opinion, with the eventual winner James Arthur mentioned more often than any other contestant from day one of the contest. 'In the final there were 1.12m Tweets from 505k unique users. There were 387k mentions for James, compared to 86k for the runner up Jahmene Douglas,' the report said. Rising excitement: The X Factor bucks the trend for reality entertainment broadcasting, with the number of tweets sent in the results show gradually rising towards its final climax . The document was prepared for Twitter's corporate customers and contains a raft of recommendations to advertisers and marketers suggesting ways they can increase engagement among consumers. 'More brands are seeing Twitter as a second screen to TV. Conversations about content and advertising happen in real-time on Twitter, scaling reach quickly on Twitter’s open platform,' it concluded. 'Through the actions of discovery and engagement Twitter and TV drive each other in a virtuous cycle. 'Every programme and every ad has a Twitter presence.

An archeological team are heading to Burma in the hopes of unearthing dozens of British Spitfires said to have been buried there at the end of the Second World War. Over one hundred unused and unassembled aircrafts were supposedly buried in the Burmese jungle by the RAF in 1945. The 21-strong excavation team flying out tomorrow will include a 90-year-old war veteran who claims to have witnessed the burial of the Spitfires after the war ended. Exciting excavation expedition: A team leaving for Burma tomorrow hopes to find the up to 124 Spitfire planes they believe to have been buried in boxes in the jungle at the end of World War II (file photo) Some 36 planes are thought to be lying undiscovered in Mingaladon - one of three potential sites in the country - with as many 124 Spitfires buried in total. Farmer and aviation enthusiast David Cundall, from Lincolnshire, is spearheading the dig, having spent 17 years and thousands of pounds researching the project. Speaking at Heathrow Airport's Hilton Hotel, in London, he described plans to return the Spitfires to Britain for restoration to allow them to be flown again. ‘There's lot of rumours about why they were buried but the common theory is that they were buried after the war - in August and December 1945 - because they were surplus to requirements. Somebody gave the order, let's dig a hole and let's bury them. 'They will be restored to flying . condition and hopefully they'll be flying in about three years’ time at . air shows, and promoting British industry as well.’ High hopes: Aircraft enthusiast David Cundall, 62, has spent the past 17 years researching and investigating into the case of the missing Spitfires and will finally head to Burma tomorrow . The team includes British war veteran Stanley Coombe, from Eastbourne, who responded to Mr Cundall's appeal for witnesses who saw the Mark XIV Spitfires being buried 68 years ago. Mr Coombe, who is now in his early 90s, was stationed in Burma at the end of the Second World War and is one of eight eye-witnesses to come forward. The planes are believed to be buried some 25 to 30 feet below the ground, and Mr Cundall believes they may have been protected from erosion due to a lack of oxygen underground. Project archaeologist Andy Brockman said: ‘The archaeological team are treating this like a police mystery.

The contract allowing the dig to go ahead will see the Burmese Government take 50 per cent of the value of aircraft recoveredm while Mr Cundall's share will be 30 per cent and his agent 20 per cent. It followed a meeting between Prime Minister David Cameron and Burmese president Thein Sein earlier this year where Burma agreed to lift the trade sanctions. Mr Cundall helped persuaded the country's notoriously secretive regime to allow him to search for the lost aircraft, winning their trust over several visits. The married father-of-three doggedly pieced together their possible location by speaking to the declining number of Far East veterans . He said at the time: 'I’m only a small farmer, I’m not a multi-millionaire and it has been a struggle. It took me more than 15 years but I finally found them. 'Spitfires are beautiful aeroplanes and should not be rotting away in a foreign land. 'They saved our neck in the Battle of Britain and they should be preserved.' Mr Cundall added: ‘I think this is on the same level as the Tutankhamun find in Egypt. ‘If we're successful, I'd like to repeat what archaeologist Howard Carter said then. 'Lord Carnarvon asked: “Can you see anything?”, and he replied: “Yes, wonderful things”.’","Over one hundred Spitfires believed to have been buried in Burma in 1945 .

But one embarrassing summer holiday in Turkey made her determined to shed the excess pounds. Jodie during the life-changing holiday in Turkey (l) and slimmed down today (r). She is now a keen runner . In June 2009, Jodie joined her mother Jo, 45 and friend on holiday to Bodrum. On the first day of the holiday the girls decided to treat themselves to a traditional Turkish bath and massage at their hotel. Jodie, at 5ft 2in and a dress size 22, was a little anxious about having to strip down to her underwear, but was left red faced and humiliated after the masseur ridiculed her over her size. 'The masseur told me to take my clothes off so I stripped down to my underwear,' she said. 'The first thing he did was point to my stomach and said ""baby?"". I was gob smacked, and told him ""no, definitely not"". 'He then said again ""baby?"" while making belly shapes with his hands on his own stomach. ""I was horrified."" Determined effort: Jodie during her 5k charity run in June 2010. She had slimmed down from a size 22 to a size 16 by this point. Today she is a super-fit size 8 . Then the masseur started to tease . Jodie telling her that she should not have a protruding belly, and while . pinching and wobbling her fat throughout the massage told her that it . was unnatural. 'He said to me ""What's this?

Then one night back at home in Oxford, Jodie looked back through her holiday pictures with disgust. 'I looked at myself in the photographs and said, ""I have to change"". 'I saw myself smiling, but I didn't look happy, there was a sadness around me.' The next day Jodie joined a gym and decided to give herself a target to motivate her weight-loss. She set a date to run the Race for Life in June 2010 and began going to the gym three times a week, ditching her junk food diet to get into shape. At first Jodie, who works as a personnel officer at Oxford University could barely run 30 seconds, let alone 5k, and was embarrassed at how loud her running was on the treadmill. But when she swapped the greasy takeaways and ready meals for chicken and vegetables, she soon increased her energy levels and was able to run over an hour in the gym. Within six months she had already lost an impressive four stone. Her old diet consisted of toast with . big dollops of Nutella layered on top for breakfast, a chocolate bar and . hot chocolate for a mid-morning snack, a big baguette with crisps and a . fizzy drink for lunch. In the afternoon, she tucked into biscuits, while dinner was a takeaway or . ready meal with chips for dinner, as well as the occasional whole pot of . Ben and Jerry's ice cream. But . now Jodie eats a diet of oats with water and a scoop of whey protein . for breakfast, Greek yoghurt, white fish with vegetables and chicken . with spinach and sweet potatoes. In . June 2010, on her 21st birthday, she completed the Race for Life in . just 35 minutes and immediately gave herself another goal - a half . marathon the following year in April 2011- which she also completed in 1 . hour and 53 minutes. Now Jodie is a svelte size 8 and super fit. Jodie in 2007 when she was a size 18 to 20. She said she had always been known as the 'cuddly one' She said: 'I now train six days a week, doing around one hour . cardiovascular exercise plus weight training which targets specific . muscle groups. It takes an awful lot of self-discipline. 'However, . as I have lost such a large amount of weight I have a small amount of . spare skin on my lower abdomen which will need to be removed through . surgery before I can compete.' Joining . the gym also helped Jodie find love with fellow fitness fanatic, . bodybuilder partner Tom Baker, 26, who works in car production. 'Tom, is a huge source of motivation for me. 'I knew him from when I was a bit younger and he was a close friend of my brothers, but I hid away from him back then. 'We came to know each other more during 2011 and would always talk about the gym and fitness as it was a shared interest. 'We got together officially in January 2012 and it has been the happiest year of my life so far. We train together quite often and we have a very similar diet as he is also a body builder.' Looking back at who she was just a few years ago Jodie said: 'If some would have said I'd look like this back then, I would have said 'no chance'. 'Looking back, I ironically have a lot to thank that Turkish masseur, as he inspired me to change my life. He did me the biggest favour.'

Scroll down for video . Everyone has experienced that irritating moment when they can't get a song out of their head. But one woman has been plagued for three years by a a rare illness which means she hears novelty 50s hit 'How Much is that Doggie in the Window?' Susan Root suffers from a form of tinnitus where music and songs play constantly in her head on a loop - meaning she has had to endure three years of sleepless nights. Other tunes which have intermittently tormented the 63-year-old school cleaner during that time also include God Save the Queen, Happy Birthday and Auld Lang Syne. Mrs Root explained: 'It's like having a radio that you just can't turn off. 'I began hearing tunes in my ears three years ago and it just has not stopped since. 'It's especially bad at night time and I have terrible trouble getting to sleep - it drives me to breaking point at times. 'It comes and goes but I can always hear music, especially How Much is that Doggie in the Window, faintly in the background.' The rare condition, known as musical hallucination, has left doctors baffled with hospital consultants saying there is nothing more they can do to treat her bizarre problem. Susan, of Coggeshall, Essex, continued: 'They have given me a hearing aid which they had hoped would fix my hearing problems and therefore stop the music but it just hasn't worked. 'I had special therapy too but they've now told me there is nothing more they can do. 'I've come to accept that I'm probably going to be stuck with this hellish condition for the rest of my life.' Susan Root used to love 'How Much Is That Doggy In The Window', a version made famous by Patti Page (right) Susan has worked as a cleaner at the . Honywood Community Science School for the past 27 years and has learnt . to live with the condition by using calming noises, such as bird song . and whale music, to block out the phantom tunes. But the annoying music is often so loud it drowns out the sound of her retired lorry driver husband Graham when he is speaking. She added: 'There are times when my husband will be trying to talk to me and I can't hear what he is saying over the music. 'It can be very frustrating and it drives us both mad at times.' Susan has had problems with her hearing since a very young age around the same time that she first heard the tune that most commonly features in her musical hallucinations. She said: 'My mum told me that when I was young I used to love the song How Much is that Doggie in the Window. 'I used to sing it around the house all the time but now I can't stand it.' Patti Page sings 'How Much is that Doggie in the Window?' A spokesman for the British Tinnitus Association said: 'Musical hallucination is the sensation of hearing music when none is being played. 'Musical hallucinations have a compelling sense of reality and are often mistaken for real music until it becomes clear that none is being played. This is especially true when they are experienced for the first time. 'They are typically heard as short fragments of simple melodies - often from music heard regularly and familiar from youth, and especially from hymns and carols. 'Individuals with hearing loss sometimes notice that the music in these hallucinations sounds as it did when it was first heard and not how it would with their current level of hearing. 'The most common and easily treatable cause of musical hallucination is hearing loss, so your doctor is likely to request that you undergo some tests of your hearing and, based on the results of this, may prescribe a hearing aid which many people find makes their musical hallucination less intrusive.' According to the British Tinnitus Association, around 10 per cent of the adult UK population suffer from a mild form of tinnitus with one per cent saying it affects their quality of life. Last month former Oasis guitarist and songwriter Noel Gallagher revealed he was suffering from the condition, adding his name to a long list of high profile tinnitus sufferers including The Who's Pete Townsend and Coldplay's Chris Martin.","Suffers from musical hallucination where a song constantly plays .

A court will appoint a lawyer to protect the interests of the four-month-old orphaned daughter of the late Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher as her grandparents argue over custody. Belcher fatally shot the child's mother, Kasandra Perkins, on December 1 in their Kansas City home, then drove to Arrowhead Stadium and killed himself in front of coaches and the team's general manager. Belcher's mother, Cheryl Shepherd, had been living with the couple for about two weeks and was in the home when her son killed Perkins. Tragic: Belcher is seen here with his girlfriend Kasandra Perkins, 22, and their baby daughter Zoey. Belcher and Perkins argued about the baby's paternity before he shot her . Shepherd received temporary custody . of Belcher's daughter, Zoey, soon after the shootings and filed a . petition in mid-December asking to be appointed as Zoey's guardian and . conservator of her estate, which is worth about $3 million. Shepherd, of West Babylon, New York, also filed a second petition seeking to be named administrator of her son's estate. On Friday morning, she sat silently . between her two attorneys in a Jackson County courtroom as probate . commissioner Daniel Wheeler addressed the petitions. Wheeler changed the status of the . custody petition to 'contested' because Zoey's maternal grandparents and . other family members in Texas have filed a petition in that state to be . Zoey's legal guardians. He also ordered the appointment of a . guardian ad litem – an attorney who represents the interests of minor . children – and set a December 25 hearing on Shepherd's petition to take . over her son's estate. The Ford Worth Star-Telegram reported Friday that Zoey is staying with relatives in Austin, Texas. Troubled: The murder-suicide has sparked debate in the NFL about gun ownership and the personal struggles of players . In addition to the well-being of the child, millions of dollars are at stake in the custody battle. Zoey's estate or guardian will . receive more than $1 million under terms of the NFL's collective . bargaining agreement, including $108,000 annually over the next four . years, $48,000 in the fifth year and $52,000 each year until she turns . 18. She can keep receiving that amount until she is 23 if she attends . college. A trust funded by the Hunt family, . which owns the Chiefs, along with team coaches, players, employees and . contributions from the public, will help care for the child. Also, Belcher's beneficiary will . receive $600,000 in life insurance, plus $200,000 for each credited . season – Belcher was in his fourth season at the time of his death – and . $100,000 in a retirement account. Shepherd's attorney, Gretchen Gold, . declined to answer questions after the hearing and said her client . didn't have any comments, either. Zoey's maternal grandparents, Rebecca . Anne Gonzalez and Darryl Perkins, and other Texas relatives have filed a . lawsuit seeking temporary custody of the girl, that her residence be in . Tarrant County, Texas, and that a guardian ad litem be appointed. A Fort Worth judge has scheduled a . January 22 hearing in that lawsuit. The judge will conduct a conference . Jan. 17 with his Jackson County, Missouri, counterpart and attorneys for . Zoey's maternal and paternal grandparents to discuss whether Texas or . Missouri has jurisdiction in the case. The other woman: Brittni Glass spent the night with Belcher before he murdered his girlfriend but has since denied the two had a sexual relationship . It is believed that the murder suicide took place after a row about whether or not Belcher was the Zoey's father. His suicide was witnessed by coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli. A source told the New York Post: . '[Cheryl] believed that there was an issue over whether [Belcher] was . the father. She said he believed he wasn’t necessarily the father of . the child.' A Kansas City law-enforcement source confirmed: 'She told police there was a question about the paternity.' The . source added: 'The implication was that paternity was what the two of . them were fighting about — that the baby might not have been his.' The couple had been receiving counseling for relationship and financial problems, police said. A spokeswoman said she would not comment on the doubts raised over baby Zoey's paternity. It also emerged last month that the NFL player . had a secret girlfriend - Brittni Glass - who he allegedly told he would shoot Perkins 'if . she didn't leave him alone'. Belcher is also believed to have had . drinks and dinner with her before he arrived home, shot his . girlfriend after a blazing row, and then ended his own life. Details of the Belcher case are contained in police reports submitted to the Jackson County prosecutor, who has ruled the event a murder-suicide. They include dozens of interviews with witnesses. Glass has denied the two were in a relationship. Glass, also 22, told police that Belcher complained about Perkins threatening to take all his money and the baby if they broke up. He said Perkins 'knew exactly how to press his buttons and make him angry,' according to a summary of the woman's interview with police. Belcher had been with the woman and some of her friends at a downtown Kansas City entertainment district the night before the shooting, the woman said. He spent part of the night in her apartment and part of it sleeping in his car before going home early in the morning, the report said. He and Perkins were arguing before he shot her, his mother, Cheryl Shepherd, told police. Shepherd had moved in with the couple two weeks earlier to help care for the baby. Shepherd heard Belcher say 'You won't talk to me that way' and then she heard a thump and gunshots. Shepherd rushed into the bedroom and found Perkins lying on the bathroom floor, she told police. Before fleeing the house, Belcher knelt next to Perkins, apologized and repeatedly kissed her, his daughter and his mother, Shepherd said. Belcher drove off in his Bentley to . the practice facility at Arrowhead several miles away, where he pulled . into the parking lot and saw Pioli, the report said. Pioli quoted Belcher as saying, 'I . did it, I killed her.' Belcher held a handgun to his own head. 'I got to . go, can't be here, and take care of my daughter,' Pioli recalled . Belcher saying. He had asked to speak with Crennel . and linebacker coach Gary Gibbs, the report said. Crennel told police he . pleaded with Belcher to put down the gun. One witness said she heard . Crennel say, 'you're taking the easy way out'. Belcher lowered the gun, but only to load a round into the chamber, Crennel told police. Seeing a police officer in the distance and hearing sirens, Belcher knelt behind a mini-van, blessed himself and fired the gun into his temple, the report said. Paying respects: Hundreds of mourners memorialized Jovan Belcher at his funeral - despite his murdering the mother of his child before committing suicide .

George Black attended the Temple Hill Surgery in Dartford, Kent, three times complaining of chest pain but was each time turned away . A father who repeatedly went to his GP with chest pains could have been saved if a doctor had read his tests properly, an inquest heard. Dr Adekemi Osadiya failed to examine George Black, 49, after a practice nurse flagged up abnormalities on his ECG examination. Mr. Black attended the Temple Hill Surgery, in Dartford, Kent, three times complaining of chest pain but was each time sent away without being properly investigated. North Kent Coroner's Court heard he died from a heart attack just eight days after his final visit to the practice on January 9, 2012 complaining of indigestion. Coroner Roger Hatch said the surgery's lead GP, Dr Arun Kothari, had agreed further tests should have been arranged - and at the very least it should have been arranged for Mr Black to go to the local hospital. However 'this, for whatever reason, was not done,' said the coroner. The inquest heard how the practice nurse at the surgery carried out an ECG examination on Mr Black. Dr Osadiya admitted this showed an abnormality to Mr. Black's heart. His records also showed that both his parents and his two brothers had suffered heart problems. The coroner told Dr Osadiya: 'You knew of the complaints of chest pains, and that he had complained about it before. 'We also know there was an abnormality found by you in the ECG.' Dr Osadiya replied: 'I am sorry, but he came in for a medical. Looking through the medical records I do not have any record he had had chest pains before.' Mr Hatch asked: 'Didn't you think you should have asked for further tests to be conducted?' Dr Osadiya said she would have checked the results of the blood tests carried out that day but didn't because she only worked at the surgery for three weeks. Mr Black's family later said staff at the surgery should be 'hung out to dry' over his death . She added she hadn't spoken to the patient about his condition, she said the practice nurse had provided a 'very good history' of what he had. The nurse had told her Mr Black had complained of chest pain three or four times a day. Mr Hatch replied: 'She is not a doctor. Why not take two minutes to go and ask him?' Dr Osadiya added  that her opinion was that  the chest pain was caused by a lung disease identified at the post mortem as possibly mesothelioma (cancer of the lining of the lung due to asbestos exposure). The coroner said: 'I am recording a verdict of misadventure as the result of the failure to further investigate the ECG, given the family history and the chest pains about which he complained in November, on December 19 and on January 9.' Mr. Black's family later said staff at the surgery should be 'hung out to dry'. His daughter Kelly-Ann Black, 31, from Dartford, Kent, said: 'My dad is lying is his grave because they didn't check properly. Someone should deal with that. They should be hung out to dry.' The family is now considering making a formal complaint to the General Medical Council and they are also taking legal advice. But after the inquest Dr Osadiya said that with the benefit of hindsight she would have done exactly the same again. She said: 'There was no evidence of heart disease apart from tension which could be due to slightly enlarged heart.' 'I would still have done the same thing going by his history.'","George Black attended the Temple Hill Surgery in Dartford, Kent .

Callum Brown, with father Neil and mother Sharon, flew to St Louis Children's Hospital in Missouri for selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery to improve the muscle tone in his lower legs . The procedure involves severing the nerves in the spine that send messages to paralyse the leg muscles . The procedure involves severing the nerves in the spine that send messages to paralyse the leg muscles. With the tensed muscles free to resume normal movement, the patient is then able to walk. After over five hours on the operating table and gruelling physiopherapy, Callum stunned his parents Sharon and Neil by taking his first supported steps just four days after the operation. The huge development came after primary school pupil Callum felt some pain following the surgery. But now he is recovering and is determined to work hard with his physiotherapist to keep progressing. His parents, Sharon and Neil Brown, spent two years raising more than £50,000 to . pay for the surgery in America which they hope will enable him to walk . unaided. Callum stunned his parents by taking his first supported steps just four days after the operation . Mrs Brown, 40, said she was delighted at Callum's first steps. She said: 'We are so proud of him, he has done fantastically well. We never thought that four days post-op he would want to try and walk and push himself so much. 'I can see the pain in his face but also the determination. He deserves the world after what he has been through in such a short period of time, double hip surgery and this. 'We asked him if he wanted to stand and he said OK. 'Me and the physio stood him up and counted to 10, us supporting his arms, and he did this several times, then to our amazement he said: ""Can I walk?"". Callum's parents spent two years raising more than £50,000 to pay for the surgery in America which they hope will enable him to walk unaided . 'We both supported him, and he took 10 steps twice which was fantastic, although we had his arms he was still moving his legs himself.

'He was tired and cried a little, saying his back was really hurting, but he decided he would get on with it and let us put him on his waking frame, and he managed to walk on that 10 steps again, three times.' Callum, who suffers from diplegic cerebral palsy, jetted off to America with his parents for the surgery by world-renowned surgeon Dr TS Park.

Selective dorsal rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The . lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contain the . neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve . fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the . body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This . process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting . the spastic muscles and which may not be 'transmitting' properly are . identified and cut. Due . to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise . procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a . general anaesthetic. Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs.

Farmers believe labourers from Bulgaria and Romania are likely to desert the strawberry fields for better paid and more comfortable work in towns and cities . Farmers fear a strawberry shortage next summer because of the lifting of immigration rules for Romanians and Bulgarians, it was revealed today. They believe 22,000 agricultural labourers from the two countries who currently work as summer fruit pickers are likely to desert the strawberry fields for better paid and more comfortable work in towns and cities. As a result shops and supermarkets are at risk of running short of strawberries and other seasonal crops because there will be too few workers to harvest them. The threat of a shortage of fruit pickers was disclosed by Home Office immigration adviser Professor David Metcalf. Professor Metcalf said the National Farmers Union is pressing for a relaxation of immigration rules to allow tens of thousands of agricultural workers from outside Europe to come into Britain to replace the lost Bulgarian and Romanian workforce. Citizens of the two eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2007 will be free to come to Britain and work without restriction from January next year. Even though the lifting of migration and labour barriers against Poles and workers from seven other eastern European countries in 2004 brought between a million and a million and a half workers to Britain, Whitehall has yet to produce estimates of the numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians who may arrive. At present, 21,750 Romanians and Bulgarians come into this country for six months of the year under the terms of the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme. The end of restrictions on the jobs these workers can take mean that many may decide to pursue other work in Britain. Professor Metcalf, the chairman of the Home Office's Migration Advisory Committee, said: 'The question is, in 2014, when Romanians and Bulgarians get completely free access to the labour market, will they decide that they would rather go to work in hotels, or pubs, or Tesco, and therefore will there be enough people to pick the strawberries? 'Farmers are wanting a scheme from outside the EU at a time when we have 25 million unemployed in the EU. It's a difficult one. Who's going to pick the strawberries?' At present, 21,750 Romanians and Bulgarians come into the UK for six months of the year under the terms of the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme . Professor Metcalf said his committee had not been asked to estimate numbers who might come from Romania and Bulgaria, although he said he did expect Downing Street to request information on why many employers prefer workers from Europe to British workers. He said: 'My understanding is that the Foreign Office-commissioned report from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research goes through a lot of interesting economic stuff, but doesn't have numbers.' The Migration Advisory Committee recommended that immigration rules on skilled migrants from outside Europe should be widened to allow in more engineers, including nuclear safety engineers to work in the decommissioning of old nuclear power stations, and railway signalling engineers to work on Crossrail and HS2. It also said there were shortages in Britain of chicken sexers and computer games designers. However, successful training in the medical profession over the past decade means there are now enough British-educated brain surgeons and other consultants, the committee's report said.",Home Office adviser says the National Farmers Union wants non-Europeans to be allowed to replace the lost workforce .

Reg Turnill, the man who brought the space race to a generation of Britons, has died at the age of 97. As the BBC’s space correspondent from Sputnik through to the shuttle era, Mr Turnill was the voice of extra-planetary exploration for more than 40 years. Described by friends as an ‘astronaut who never made it to the Moon’, he reported on every Nasa Apollo mission, including breaking the story to the world that Apollo 13 was in trouble in 1970. Star: Reg Turnhill, who reported on space exploration from the 1950s until the 1990s, died at the age of 97 . He saw the development of modern aviation at first hand, reporting on radio and television from the 1950s until the 1990s – a period which saw a dramatic transformation in the possibilities of space exploration. Later, in semi-retirement, he brought the drama of space to life for schoolchildren on the BBC Newsround programme. Last summer, well into his 90s, he contributed to coverage of death of Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon. Mr Turnill’s eldest son confirmed the news of his father’s death yesterday. Michael Turnill, 72, said his father retained a ‘remarkable’ mind until his death. He had carried on an active role in aerospace journalism was still writing stories just eight weeks ago, he said. Mr Turnill’s career began at the age of 15 as a telephonist for the Press Association in Fleet Street, typing up stories phoned in by reporters. He was promoted to become staff reporter at the news agency and in 1956 was recruited by the BBC as assistant industrial correspondent. Michael Turnill, 72, said his father retained a ¿remarkable¿ mind until his death . In 1958, he was made the BBC’s air and space correspondent, with a brief to cover defence. It was the start of the jet age and he reported on the introduction of passenger flights, including taking a seat on Concorde’s maiden flight in March 1969. But it was his coverage of space exploration which really captured the imagination of his viewers and listeners. He was friends with Wernher von Braun, the architect of Nasa’s moon programme, enabling him to secure interviews with many Apollo astronauts during his career. Mr Turnill later recalled how he became the first to report that the Apollo 13 mission was in trouble. ‘It was 10 o’clock Houston time, 4am London time, and I just looked in to a deserted mission control,’ he said in 2007. ‘All was going well, most journalists had gone to bed. I was just turning to leave the deserted press centre when I heard the famous words: “Houston, we’ve had a problem”. ‘By 5am I’d broken the story. The astronauts were in deadly danger.’ Nick Spall, fellow of the British Interplanetary Society, described Mr Turnill as ‘one of a kind’. He said he had spoken to the correspondent recently and said he was ‘full of his old enthusiasm’. ‘My key memory was of this father figure on TV in the 1960s, explaining it all in a very British way,’ said Mr Spall. He was the astronaut who never made it to the Moon.’ In his later years, he lived in Sandgate, Kent. Mr Turnill passed away peacefully in the early hours yesterday (12th) at the Pilgrim’s Hospice in Ashford, where he had been for the past month. He is survived by his wife Margaret and their two sons.","Reported from the 1950s until the 1990s, covering every NASA mission .

Train company bosses are enjoying huge salaries at a time when six out of ten passengers are dissatisfied with their train company, damning new figures reveal today. More than half of train firms received a customer satisfaction rating of 50per cent or less in the latest survey. Yet at the state-run East Coast line, where services are being run directly by the Government, there are eight directors on salaries of more than £100,000 a year. East Coast Trains is paid for by the taxpayer and has as many as eight directors on salaries above £100,000 . The East Coast information supplied showed that one director - almost certainly managing director Karen Boswell - was on a salary of between £161,000 and £180,000. Two directors’ salaries came within the £121,000 to £140,000 band, and five other directors were on between £100,000 and £120,000 a year. Meanwhile, none of the 18 other train operating companies were prepared to reveal how many of their directors were on six-figure salaries - even though the railway industry receives around £5billion a year from the taxpayer. Network Rail's chief executive Sir David Higgins was on an annual basic salary of £560,000 as of March 31 last year . Critics accused them ‘hiding behind a veil of secrecy as they bleed passengers dry’. Train . companies became the subject of fury earlier when passengers were hit . by above-inflation fare rises - despite the poor punctuality and ‘cattle . class’ travel conditions faced by many commuters. The . latest research by Which? shows that only 1 in 5 (22per cent) of train . travellers feel their service is improving, despite the fare rises. First . Capital Connect, which suffered severe disruption last week, was bottom . in the satisfaction league table of 19 rail companies with only 40per . cent of passengers satisfied with its service. Passengers said the service’s commuter trains were consistently overcrowded and poor value for money. Northern, . First Great Western, South Eastern and Greater Anglia railways all . fared poorly, with fewer than 45 per cent of passengers satisfied. The results were compiled by Which? from responses from 7,500 regular train users. Citing some of the feedback it received, Which? said: ‘One First Capital Connect customer told us: ‘The price has increased and the trains get more and more crowded. I never see any improvements for the extra money I am paying’. ‘And a Southeastern passenger said: ‘The prices are terrible, the service is bad and trains are often delayed, cancelled and dirty.’. The survey also showed that 40per cent of train travellers are likely to cut the number of journeys following the recent inflation-busting price increases which have seen season tickets rise by an average of 4.2per cent but some fares soaring 10 per cent. But a third of commuters said they did not have an alternative way of getting to work and ‘will just have to pay more’, says the report. Overall, the report concluded, only 22 per cent of train users felt that things were ‘on the up.’ A spokesman for First Capital Connect rejected the findings - suggesting that some of the customers must have had an ‘axe to grind.’ ‘This is questionable research which quizzed just 461 people online out of the 170,000 we carry every day,’ a spokesman said. ‘People chose to take part so many who did would have had an axe to grind. Bob Crow, general secretary of RMT, said private rail companies were 'scandalous' for not disclosing salaries . ‘A face-to-face survey by rail watchdog Passenger Focus which is audited by the Office for National Statistics that shows 81% of our passengers are satisfied or very satisfied with our service and 13% are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.’ But last month’s Passenger Focus study also showed fewer than half Britain’s train travellers think the railways are giving value for money - dropping to under a third for the worst performing operators. Pay levels for executives on the tax-payer backed East Coast were obtained following a request under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act. All other train companies insisted that they were not obliged to reply as the Freedom of Information Act did not apply to them as they were private companies. Only one company, CrossCountry, was prepared to offer any pay-level details on a non-FOI request basis. Information from CrossCountry covered the year 2011. It showed the highest paid director - almost certainly managing director Andy Cooper - was on £222,000 including pension contributions. Bosses at rail infrastructure company Network Rail (Network Rail), which is currently striving to meet punctuality targets on long-haul routes, are also enjoying fat cat salaries and packages with the lure of lucrative bonuses on top. In the last few days rail passengers have endured some miserable travelling conditions, with an overhead power line problem in Hertfordshire leading to severe delays on busy commuter routes. Network Rail’s chief executive Sir David Higgins was on an annual basic salary of £560,000 as of March 31 2012, while finance director Patrick Butcher was on £382,000. Network operations chief Robin Gisby was on £360,000, as was infrastructure director Simon Kirby. In addition to their salaries, the Network Rail chiefs stand to be paid performance-related bonuses running into hundreds of thousands of pounds.","State-run East Coast line has up to eight directors on £100,000 salaries .

An affordable iPhone might be in development, the head of tech giant Apple let slip yesterday. During a rare interview, Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared to suggest that a less expensive version of their covetable but pricey gadgets might be in the pipeline. 'We are making moves to make things more affordable,' he said at the Goldman Sachs technology and internet conference in San Francisco. Rare interview: Apple CEO Tim Cook admitted the tech giant was looking at making 'more affordable' products . The revelation came after Mr Cook said that he saw a 'wide open field' because Apple's iPhone was currently 'only available to 50 per cent of [mobile phone] subscribers in the world'. Asked whether the problem might be that only 50 per cent could afford an iPhone, Mr Cook said: 'Good question.  Our North Star is ""great products"" - we would never do something that isn't a great product, that's not why we're on this earth. 'That said, if you look at what we've done to appeal to people that are price sensitive — lower price of iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, in most recent quarter, not enough supply of iPhone 4 - surprised us.' He added: 'We are making moves to make things more affordable', but insisted Apple still wanted to make something 'great'. He said: 'If you look at Apple's history, look at iPod: it was $399.  Today you can get an iPod Shuffle for $49. 'Instead of how can you cheapen to get it lower, we were saying how can we make something great? Apple CEO Tim Cook said they wanted to make 'great products' like the iPhone 5, left, and the iPad Mini, right . 'The same thing in a different way: people said why don't you have a Mac that's less than $1,000? We worked on them, we couldn't do a great product. What did we do? We invented iPad and it starts at $329. 'Sometimes you can take the issue and solve it in different ways.'Mr Cook added: 'We will never make a crappy product.' In response to a question about future innovation at Apple, which analysts have suggested might suffer from a slowing trajectory, Mr Cook said: 'I'm incredibly bullish about the future and what Apple can do'. 'No better place for innovation': The Apple iWatch is thought to be the company's next big thing . He said the culture of innovation at the firm had 'never been stronger', adding that there was a 'belief there are no limits deeply embedded in the values, in the DNA of the company.' 'I feel fantastic about it,' he said.  'There is no better place for innovation.' Earlier this week rumours flew around the world that Apple was planning an 'iWatch' with camera, Bluetooth, and voice control features.  Designers convinced that the smart-watch was the company's next big thing even mocked up pictures of what the innovation might look like. During yesterday's conference, Mr Cook dismissed as a 'silly sideshow' a recent lawsuit filed by activist shareholder David Einhorn with a view to get shareholders more money. Mr Einhorn has accused the company of having a 'Depression-era mentality' which made it hoard vast piles of money with no obvious purpose. Apple's Mr Cook said that while the company was looking at ways to get shareholders more returns, the cash might be used to make a major acquisition, and said the lawsuit was 'bizarre' when the cash reserves put the company in such a position of strength. After his appearance at the technology conference, Mr Cook flew to Washington where he was a guest of First Lady Michele Obama at the US President's State Of The Union address.","The trail-blazing technology firm is looking at 'making things more affordable'

Sales of kettles have dipped by nearly 600,000 a year, in the past five years, according to the research . Putting the kettle on is undoubtedly still an essential ingredient of everyday British life, but a recent study has found for the first time in years, less than eight in ten homes in the UK own one of the appliances. And in the past five years, sales of kettles have also lost steam, dipping by nearly 600,000 a year, according to the research. Kettles are facing competition from coffee machines, one-cup hot water dispensers and even people heating water in microwave ovens, the study suggests. Sales are also believed to have been hit as less people are drinking tea and coffee nowadays, believing caffeine is unhealthy. Demand for kettles has dropped by a massive seven per cent in the past five years, from 8.1 million sold in 2007 to 7.5 million in 2012, according to the figures from market analysts Mintel. In 2008 nearly 15 per cent or one in seven people bought a new kettle, but by last year that figure had dipped to 12.8 per cent. Overall ownership of kettles has declined from 83 per cent of the population in 2008 to 78 per cent in 2012. Neil Mason, head of retail research at Mintel, said: 'Penetration of kettles has declined by almost five five percentage points since 2008. 'To some degree this reflects competition from other appliances such as hot water taps and one-cup boilers, but also the fact that hot drinks are falling out of favour with many younger consumers, and that some households simply make do using their main cooking appliances. 'Although environmental credentials have not shaped trends within the small kitchen appliance market to the same extent as the ovens market, the kettles market is likely to be the small kitchen appliance category most affected by consumer efforts to reduce their energy bills. 'The ability for consumers to be able to access only the hot water that they need, either through tap design or alternative categories in the small kitchen appliance market, will continue to eat into kettle sales.' The electric kettle was invented by Russell Hobbs in 1956, but became popular in homes from the early 1960s onwards. Other small kitchen appliances falling out of fashion include smoothie makers and juicers, George Foreman-style health grills and deep fat fryers. Mintel's research shows that sales of coffee makers have outperformed other small kitchen appliances, reflecting Britain's growing appetite for lattes and espressos which started on the High Street. More than one in five - 22 per cent - of homes in Britain now have a coffee machine, compared to 16 per cent in 2008. The nation's love of lattes and espressos has seen the popularity of coffee machines grow .","Less than eight in ten homes in UK own kettle for the first time in years .

A man who put a father in a coma following a road rage attack has been jailed for three and a half years. James Wallington, 32, headbutted Peter Hart,40, in front of his partner and young son, and punched him so hard he fell onto the pavement and cracked his skull. Mr Hart was leaving a music festival with his family in Guildford, Surrey, and had tried to slow down the car in which Mr Wallington was travelling when he was violently attacked. The attack in July this year left Mr Hart, a father-of-one, in a coma for three weeks, Guildford Crown Court heard. The road rage assault happened as the Hart family was leaving Guilfest, the headliners for which included Jools Holland, Olly Murs and Bryan Ferry. Witnesses said that Mr Wallington appeared to have been looking for a fight when he squared up to ‘scared and confused’ Mr Hart. One witness heard shouts of ‘get out the way’ before the violent attack . Mr Wallington, soon to be a father of two, clutched his head in his hand and said ‘cheers’ to Judge Christopher Critchlow as he was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. On sentencing him Judge Critchlow said: ‘For whatever reason, when Peter Hart tried to stop the car you were travelling in because it was going too fast as a lot of people were leaving Stoke Park you got out of the car. ‘Almost immediately you assaulted him. ‘There was no justification for that whatsoever and the resulting effect on Mr Hart's life has been extremely serious and at the moment we do not know how he will recover.’ Judge Critchlow was told that at Mr Hart was walking with his partner and young son, who was in a pushchair, when a car approached them from the opposite direction. ‘It seems that the driver of the car was driving in such a way so as to cause annoyance to the complainant,’ said Peter Walsh, prosecuting. Mr Hart signalled to the car to slow down, after which Mr Wallington, who was in the passenger seat, got out of the vehicle. ‘He attacked Mr Hart by headbutting him and punching him twice causing him to fall backwards and crack his head on the concrete pavement,’ said Mr Walsh. Mr Hart has no recollection of the attack, which occurred at 6.30pm on July 13 this year on Kings Road in Guildford. The attack left Mr Hart with life-changing injuries including a brain injury that left him in a coma for three weeks. Brain injuries: Mr Wallington headbutted and punched Mr Hart causing him to fall onto the concrete pavement, leaving him in a three-week coma, Guildford Crown Court heard . Mr Walsh said he was still suffering from significant effects with his memory and speech and is still unable to return to work as a plasterer. Mr Wallington was caught after the driver of the car in which he was a passenger, contacted the police. He admitted a charge of assault at a previous hearing. Wallington has a number of previous convictions dating back to when he was a youth, including robbery, theft, burglary and dishonesty. Nadeem Holland, defending, said Wallington was due to become a father for the second time in January next year. ‘In his own words he said to me this morning that he is too old and has too many responsibilities to act in the manner he did on July 13,’ he said. ‘He lost it and lashed out first with his head and then his fists. He has described that to me today as wrong and stupid.’ Mr Wallington, from Bushy Hill, Guildford, was led to the cells as his partner, who is expecting his second child, sobbed. Speaking after the sentence Detective Constable Dave Pellatt said: ‘This was an horrific, unprovoked attack on a local man who was just trying to ensure he and his family could cross a road safely. ‘The sentencing today reflects the severity of this attack and I hope it goes some way to enabling the victim to move on with his life. He has suffered considerably, both physically and emotionally as a result of the brutal encounter and it is a testament to him that he has been able to help officers with the investigation. ‘I would also like to thank members of the public who came forward with invaluable information following our appeals for help.’ ‘Surrey Police will not tolerate behaviour of this kind towards innocent members of the public and will relentlessly pursue every line of enquiry to identify any person/s responsible and bring them to justice.’","James Wallington attacked Peter Hart for trying to get his car to slow down .

Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company will produce one of its existing lines of Mac computers in the United States next year. In a series of interviews he revealed the giant will spend $100m to move a production line from China to the US. He also spoke about his relationship with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs - and denied claims he was 'like a robot'. Apple CEO Tim Cook has revealed plans to move one of the firm's major production for its Mac computers to the US from China . Cook made the comments in part of an interview taped for NBC's 'Rock Center,' but aired Thursday morning on 'Today' and posted on the network's website. In a separate interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, he said that the company will spend $100 million in 2013 to move production of the line to the U.S. from China. 'It’s not known well that the engine for the iPhone and iPad is made in . the U.S., and many of these are also exported—the engine, the processor,' he said. 'The glass is made in Kentucky, and next year we are going to bring some . production to the U.S. on the Mac. 'We’re really proud of it. 'We could have quickly maybe done just . assembly, but it’s broader because we wanted to do something more . substantial. Apple's iMac computer could be the first to be manufactured in the US after the firm revealed it plans to spend $100m to move production from China . 'So we’ll literally invest over $100 million. 'This doesn’t . mean that Apple will do it ourselves, but we’ll be working with people, . and we’ll be investing our money. Like most consumer electronics companies, Apple lets contract manufacturers assemble its products overseas. However, the assembly accounts for little of the cost of making a PC or smartphone. Most of the cost lies in buying chips, and many of those are made in the U.S., Cook noted in his interview with NBC. The company and its manufacturing partner Foxconn Technology Group have faced significant criticism this year over working conditions at the Chinese facilities where Apple products are assembled, prompting Foxconn to raise salaries. Apple CEO Tim Cook has revealed plans to move production of one of its Mac computers from China to America . Cook didn't say which line of computers would be produced in the U.S. or where in the country they would be made. Regardless, the U.S. manufacturing line is expected to represent just a tiny piece of Apple overall production, with sales of iPhones and iPads now dwarfing those of its computers. Cook said in his interview with NBC that companies like Apple chose to produce their products in places like China, not because of the lower costs associated with it, but because the manufacturing skills required just aren't present in the U.S. anymore. He added that the consumer electronics world has never really had a big production presence in the U.S. As a result, it's really more about starting production in the U.S. than bringing it back. Apple originally made its computers in the U.S. It started outsourcing production in the mid-90s, first by selling some plants to contract manufacturers, then by hiring manufacturers overseas. It assembled iMacs in Elk Grove, California, until 2004. The news comes a day after Apple posted its worst stock drop in four years, erasing $35 million in market capitalization. Apple shares fell $1.79 to $537 in Thursday morning trading. Tim Cook, left, with Steve Jobs at the launch of the iMac computer. Cook today said Jobs' best trait was his ability to change his mind . Cook also revealed how Steve Jobs' made Cook's elevation to CEO drama-free. 'He goes, “I never want you to ask what I would have done,' said Cook. 'Just do what’s right - he was very clear. He was making this point, and he says, “I hope you listen to my input if I want to input on something.” I said, “Of course.” (Laughs.) But he was so clear, and I have to tell you that it’s probably . removed a tremendous burden from me that would have been there . otherwise. And he repeated this much closer to his passing. I think in the second instance, I think he did that because he knew it would lift a burden. It was his way of making sure Apple would not be burdened by the past. 'Maybe the most underappreciated thing about Steve was that he had the courage to change his mind. And you know—it’s a talent.' Cook also spoke about how he is perceived outside the firm. 'The person you read about is robotic. 'There are some good things about that, perhaps. (Laughs.) Discipline comes to mind. But it sounds like there is just no emotion. People that know me, I don’t think they would say that. I certainly am not a fist-pounder. That isn’t my style. But that and emotion are two different things. On Apple's remarkable year of innovation, he said: 'No company would have done what we did this year. 'Think about it. We changed the vast majority of our iPhone in a day. We didn’t kind of—you know, change a little bit here or there. 'iPad, we changed the entire lineup in a day. The most successful product in consumer electronics history, and we change it all in a day and go with an iPad mini and a fourth-generation iPad. 'Who else is doing this? Eighty percent of our revenues are from products that didn’t exist 60 days ago. Is there any other company that would do that? ' Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook, talks with NBC's Brian Williams . Cook spoke to Bloomberg Business magazine in one of his first major interviews . He also addressed the firm's issues with its Maps service. 'We had a list of things that we thought would be a great customer experience, and we couldn’t do it any other way than to do it ourselves.  We set on a course some years ago and began to do that. 'So it wasn’t a matter of saying, 'Strategically it’s important that we not work with company X.' We set out to give the customer something to provide a better experience. And the truth is it didn’t live up to our expectations. We screwed up. On Apple's litigation with Samsung, he admitted 'It is awkward. I hate litigation. I absolutely hate it. For us, this is about values. 'What we would like, in a perfect world, is for everyone to invent their own stuff. We love competition. 'But we want people to have their own ideas and invent their own stuff. So after lots of trying, we felt we had no other choice.' On why mobile software head Scott Forstall and retail chief John Browett were replaced, Cook revealed: 'The key in the change that you’re referencing is my deep belief that collaboration is essential for innovation—and I didn’t just start believing that. 'I’ve always believed that. It’s always been a core belief at Apple. Steve very deeply believed this… So how do we keep doing that and keep taking it to an even higher level?

Mrs Boll picked up the unique miniature furniture items from various countries including Japan, Switzerland and Yugoslavia, as well as from fairs, junk shops and gypsy markets while on her holidays. She also picked up pieces from auctions and fairs, including Swiss Lundy furniture, which kitted out an entire house. Now the unique collection of houses will go under the hammer at the Newcastle salerooms of Anderson & Garland, though it is so large that it will be split across two separate auctions, the first of which is being held tomorrow while the second will be a fortnight later. The sale will also include hundreds of pieces of furniture. Mrs Bell's mother bought her first second-hand dolls house with furniture in 1925 when Nora was just two and they lived in Elswick, Newcastle. This was joiner-made and made around 1910 - meaning it has survived two world wars. Over time the collection grew and they would buy from different shops, including a toy shop in Newcastle called Alfreds, where they would pick up furniture. The hobby stopped however when Mrs Bell's mother died at the beginning of World War II and everything in the house was split up. Fortunately, Mrs Boll's brother kept on to the house and a box of furniture to be passed on to Mrs Bell after the war and she picked up the hobby again after retiring as a physiotherapist. One of her favourite purchases was the house made up entirely with Swiss Lundy furniture which has three tiers to it - each one has a different type of painted furniture on it. She also loved the largest house which was bought at Featonby's and can be accessed from the front and back. The furniture from that particular house was made around the 1940s with the curtains made up of parachute material. Peek-a-boo: The houses are kitted out with everything from fireplaces to sofas as well as miniature occupants . Unique: Mrs Boll found many of the miniature house items at fairs, junk shops and gypsy markets around the world . Mrs Boll would love the dolls houses to either go to a museum or someone who will cherish them like she has. She couldn't ever afford to buy a lot in one go and so she painstakingly collected piece by piece over time and looked after them with love and care. John Anderson, of Anderson & Garland, said dolls houses are still popular collectors items today. He added: 'There is something of a cult hobby based on dolls' houses and furniture. 'Modern dolls' houses are to the same scale and there are small specialist makers turning out items such as chandeliers and grandfather clocks. It is a cottage industry. 'It appeals to people who can't furnish a Grand Designs dream home but they can do it in miniature. 'But the dolls' houses in this collection are to different scales. For future generations: Mrs Boll hopes her collection with be bought by fellow doll house lovers or a museum . 'Some items of dolls' house furniture can be expensive and it has happened that we have sold some which has fetched a higher price than the real life-size equivalent items.' Alex Kingsley, PR consultant for Anderson & Garland, added: 'There has been a lot of interest already. 'It is such a unique collection. It includes stuff from Japan, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. It's quite an interesting collection. 'I've never seen one so big and to come from an old house in Heaton it's quite bizarre. 'It can be collectors who are interested in this sort of thing. A lot of people collect dolls houses and have quite big collections. Getting a closer look: John Anderson inspects the dolls houses ahead of the first auction lot tomorrow . 'A lot of the time people have collected them when they were young and are still interested when they are retired. 'Also a lot of the time people buy them who want to live in a dream house themselves but can't afford it. 'Those people will often buy expensive things for dolls houses, like a crystal chandelier because they can't afford a real one, people enjoy that. 'I think they will go for quite a lot. Some of the things are really rare and so old they should go for quite a bit. 'It is nice for the old lady who they belonged to.'

A young mother woke to the hissing of her pet cat – and to her horror found a 6ft python wrapped around her baby daughter. ‘I thought I was having a nightmare, but then realised this was no bad dream,’ said 22-year-old Tess Guthrie from the town of Lismore in northern New South Wales. ‘It was only because the cat was hissing that I woke up and saw the snake with its body wrapped around my daughter Zara’s arm.’ Waking nightmare: Tess Guthrie, 22, from the . town of Lismore in northern New South Wales, stands in the room where . she woke to find a 6ft python wrapped around her two-year-old daughter's . arm . Mrs Guthrie threw herself at the snake, grabbing it by the head and tried to pry it off her two-year-old daughter, who had been sleeping beside her mother. But the snake fought back and sank its fangs three times into Zara’s hand. Still, courageous Mrs Guthrie managed to pry the snake from her daughter and call for help, bringing an ambulance and a snake catcher racing to her home. While Zara was being treated at the hospital for the snake bites – which weren’t venomous – snake expert Tex Tillis hunted down the python at Mrs Guthrie’s home. He found it sleeping between the bedside table and the wall and suspects it had been in the bedroom for several days.

The shipowner wrote to leading lights . of the time or bought historic documents with signatures of notable . figures to bolster his collection. He brought in signatures of US Presidents Abraham Lincoln and George Washington, along with Prime Ministers, Gladstone and Disraeli. He organised his signatures and photographs into categories such as eminent men, churchmen, peers, commoners, bishops, kings, queens and US presidents. When he died in 1897, he left the volumes to the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne, of which he was vice-president. Now a selection of his collection has been digitised and can be read by visitors to an exhibition which opens tomorrow at the Great North Museum in Newcastle to mark the 200th anniversary of the society.

Tragic: Flight Lieutenant Fran Capps is the second to be named after three people were killed following an avalanche in the Cairngorms . The second climber killed in an avalanche in the Scottish Highlands, which claimed the lives of three people, has been named today by the Ministry of Defence. Flight Lieutenant Fran Capps, 32, originally from Dulverton, Somerset, is believed to have been on a winter skills training course when the avalanche struck in the Cairngorms. She is the second of the three victims to be named after police yesterday identified the first as RAF Squadron leader Rimon Than, 33, who was based at RAF Valley, North Wales. The avalanche struck as two groups of six climbers made their way up opposite sides of a gorge on Thursday. One group was part of a Glenmore Lodge organised winter skills training course and the second was off-duty RAF personnel. It is understood that the three climbers . involved were buried deep in the snow when rescuers found them at the . Chalamain Gap, which is a deep, rocky valley in the Cairngorms on the . route from the Cairngorm ski road to the Lairig Ghru. Police, Cairngorm mountain rescue team, Cairngorm mountain ski patrol, search and rescue dogs, RAF Lossiemouth's rescue team and three helicopters were involved in the rescue operation. The three were airlifted from the . Chalamain Gap area to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary shortly after 12.30pm on . Thursday but died of their injuries. Flt Lt Capps was commissioned into the Royal Air Force in 2001 as a logistics officer and worked on a variety of Royal Air Force stations, the MoD said. Most recently she had worked with the Chinook Force at Royal Air Force Odiham, and she had previously served on operational tours in Iraq, the Falkland Islands, Afghanistan and Qatar. RAF colleagues paid tribute to Flt Lt Capps, who was described as 'an exceptional person'. Group Captain Dominic Toriati, the Station Commander at Royal Air Force Odiham, said: 'Flight Lieutenant Fran Capps was an exceptionally dedicated Royal Air Force officer and logistician who was well known throughout the service for her remarkable commitment, her joie de vivre and her utter professionalism.' Wing Commander Ian Richardson, chairman of the RAF Mountaineering Association, said: 'Flight Lieutenant Fran Capps was a bubbly and enthusiastic member of the committee and Association. Casualties: Three people died after being airlifted to hospital in Aberdeen following the avalanche in the Scottish Highlands . 'Fran was always smiling, always enthusiastic, always welcoming and always willing to get involved and share her love of the hills with everyone in the Association and beyond. She will be sorely missed.' Flt Lt Capps was an experienced mountaineer, having taken part in a expedition in the Indian Himalayas and led a group on an expedition that circumnavigated Mount Kenya and summited Point Lenana. Her commanding officer, Officer Commanding Logistics Squadron, Squadron Leader Georgina Mews said: 'Fran was an exceptional person to know, having unbounded passion and energy and being loved by everyone on the Squadron. Her loss will be felt across the whole Logistics Community and wider.' Mark Diggins, co-ordinator of the SportScotland Avalanche Information Service, yesterday said rescue teams had worked 'incredibly hard' to dig out and locate the three casualties as quickly as possible. He said it has been a 'challenging' winter in the area in terms of the weather conditions. 'There have been violent winds, very changeable conditions and that has an effect on the snow pack,' he said. First to be named: Squadron Leader Rimon Than was also killed in the avalanche on Thursday . 'That's the situation that we had, and still have, in that there is a weakness deep down that is sort of hidden by the fresh deposits of wind-slab snow that are above that layer.'Mr Diggins advised people to keep an eye on the daily avalanche report if they are heading to the mountains. The accident was the latest to cause fatalities on the Scottish mountains since the turn of the year. Earlier this week, a hillwalker died during an expedition with a mountaineering club in the Cairngorms. Graham Connell, 31, from Castleford, West Yorkshire, was found dead in the Jacob's Ladder area on Monday, following a large-scale search for him and five other people who were reported overdue on Sunday afternoon. In a separate incident earlier this month, three men survived falling 150 metres in an avalanche in the Coire an t-Sneachda area of the Cairngorms. In January, four people were killed in an avalanche in Glencoe. Hospital doctor Rachel Majumdar, 29; PhD student Tom Chesters, 28; Christopher Bell, 24, also a PhD student; and 25-year-old junior doctor Una Finnegan died after they were caught up in an avalanche on January 19.

Experts last night said the figures would be welcomed by home owners in the capital but said it was ‘grim news’ for those already struggling to get a foot on the property ladder. Price is up: The price of a typical London home will hit half a million pounds by the end of the decade, according to leading economists . 'Grim news': David Hollingworth said it was tough for first-time buyers already facing 'an uphill struggle with a constrained mortgage market' The future is also looking bleak for . property owners in the North East and the Midlands, with evidence of a . growing ‘North-South’ divide in the housing market outside London. Economic . growth is expected to be stronger in the capital than the rest of the . country, which will help fuel a rise in house prices of 24.8 per cent in . the South East and 25.7 per cent in the East of England between 2013 . and 2018. However, prices in the North East and . Northern Ireland are forecast to grow by just 2.3 per cent and 6 per . cent over the same period. Official figures show the average cost of a home in the North East is just under £100,000, compared with £372,000 in London. Daniel Solomon, CEBR economist and author of the report, said: ‘Before the decade is out we predict the price of the average home in London will reach £500,000. House prices will be driven by London’s comparatively rosy economic growth prospects, buoyed by IT, business and professional services.’ He added: ‘Nevertheless, house price growth in London will remain notably slower than in the boom years before the financial crisis.’ The gulf in property wealth between families living in the South and those in the North was highlighted in a recent report by Halifax. It found that properties in the South are currently worth a total of £2,000billion, compared with a total of £1,670billion in every other English region combined. Responding to the latest predictions from the CEBR, David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker London & Country, said: ‘Those who already have property in London and the South East will welcome these figures but they represent grim news for first-time buyers already facing an uphill struggle with a constrained mortgage market.’ There was a time when £74,950 could buy you  a decent-sized house. How distant those days seem now! For that is the asking price for this tiny one-bedroom home which used to be someone’s garage. Just 13ft wide, it looks like a glorified Wendy House yet boasts an open-plan kitchen, dining and living area, bathroom, upstairs double bedroom, and a courtyard garden at the back. The house in Bridgwater, Somerset, has only just come on the market but has already attracted a fair amount of interest, according to estate agents. Mark Franklin of Tamlyns said: ‘We had someone come all the way down from Surrey to see it. ‘It’s very unusual. I’ve never dealt with anything quite like it before. ‘There’ll be somebody out there it would suit – perhaps a single person.’ Diminutive: Real estate agents said the converted garage, which boasts an open-plan kitchen, dining and living area, bathroom, upstairs double bedroom, and a courtyard garden would suit a singleton .","Economic growth is expected to be stronger in the capital .
