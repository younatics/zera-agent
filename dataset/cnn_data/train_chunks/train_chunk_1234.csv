"After overlooking Lionel Messi’s trip to Casino de Barcelona on Saturday evening, Luis Enrique used the same betting strategy as every other coach in the club’s recent history. Play it straight, put all your worldly possessions on Barcelona’s No 10 and cash in at the end of the night. From these positions, the last throw of the dice, Lionel Messi used to be as safe as houses. Barcelona wizard Lionel Messi dances past Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany at the Etihad . Barcelona ace Messi leaves Manchester City defender Gael Clichy on the floor at the Etihad Stadium . Instead, the Barcelona forward skulked off at the final whistle, looking like a man who had done all his money after failing to convert a 90th-minute penalty. The little man was distraught. Messi has missed five of his last 10 from the spot for Barcelona and Argentina, a worrying trend for someone who many still regard as the world’s best footballer. To be fair to him, he played like it. By the time Pablo Zabaleta brought him down in the final minute, Messi’s work for the night had already been done. He had wreaked havoc, given the run of the place by Manchester City’s benevolent defence as Luis Suarez put Barcelona into a commanding first-leg lead. The only thing missing from this bravura Messi performance was the name of the No 10 on the huge television screens hanging off the stands at the Etihad. With 37 goals already this season, including eight in the Champions League, it would take a brave man to back against him from 12 yards out. Last year, he opened the scoring here from the spot in the 54th minute. Messi skips past fellow Argentine international Pablo Zabaleta as the defender stalks the tiny terror . Suarez, Messi and Neymar celebrate at the Etihad Stadium as they turn the style on against Manchester City . The only thing missing from this bravura Messi performance was the name of the No 10 on the huge television screens hanging off the stands at the Etihad. With 37 goals already this season, including eight in the Champions League, it would take a brave man to back against him from 12 yards out. Last year, he opened the scoring here from the spot in the 54th minute. This time Joe Hart denied him, saving brilliantly as Messi went straight and getting up in time to witness the forward tamely head the rebound wide of the post. Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart can only look on as Uruguayan ace Suarez finds the corner of the goal . The City players collapse in despair as Suarez puts the ball neatly past England number on Hart . This time Joe Hart denied him, saving brilliantly as Messi went straight and getting up in time to witness the forward tamely head the rebound wide of the post. ‘It was an important save and 3-1 would have been a difficult score for us to progress because it was a very unnecessary, emotional foul,’ admitted City’s manager Manuel Pellegrini. These spot-kicks are playing on Messi, gnawing away at this little genius after his failure to put away his penalty in the Copa del Rey against Real Madrid last month. On that occasion, he scored the rebound. A third Barcelona goal would surely have finished this tie, putting it beyond the reach of City in the second leg on March 18. At 2-1, it still feels like there is far much for Pellegrini’s team to do. Messi shows Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany a clean pair of heels as the Argentine progresses . Even those connected to the Etihad concede that, penalty apart, this was a breathtaking performance by the three-time world player of the year. The set up for Suarez’s second goal was agonising for City as he drew four defenders towards him and then twisted his way through them. Sir Alex Ferguson, watching from the stands, would have appreciated that moment more than most. When Messi finally released the ball into the path of left-back Jordi Alba, his cross found the onrushing figure of Suarez to meet it from close range. Barcelona’s No 9 scored it, Messi made it. At times he was mouth-watering, particularly when he raised that left boot into the night sky to pull down a bizarre up and under from Suarez inside the area. Hart helps Messi to his feet after the Argentine attacker had been thwarted by the England international . Do you applaud a skill like that, accept it comes naturally to this gifted forward, or try to work out how the hell anyone will ever be able to stop him? Possibly all three. Here, Gael Clichy, the man you would loosely describe as Messi’s marker, was sent off for a second booking and will miss the second leg in the Nou Camp. Clichy will not forget this night in a long while. Incredibly the left back’s two cautions had nothing to do with Messi and he was sent off in the 74th minute for a foul on Dani Alves. By then, he had been shredded by Messi. Messi is left stunned with his head in his hands as he misses a penalty to give Barcelona a two goal advantage . Messi tricks himself past a trio of sky blue shirts as he looks to attack Hart in the Manchester City goal . Hart looks on as the former Liverpool ace is able to celebrate against former rivals Manchester City . This was also a bad night for City’s captain Vincent Kompany after he headed down into the path of Suarez to open the scoring in the 16th minute. No-one knows if Kompany is any good any more, or whether this City defence is just to bad at the highest level of the European game that he keeps being exposed.Either way he escaped when he brought down Messi as he made his way into the area, with German referee Felix Brych giving him the benefit of the doubt. It is incredible that Pellegrini made no special plans to contain one of the best players we have witnessed. Messi’s intelligence is remarkable, working it all out tactically in his head in the opening five minutes and instructing Suarez to switch positions. Messi had the City defence worked out. After Sergio Aguero’s 69th-minute strike, City travel to the Nou Camp for the second leg believing they can get back into this tie. Their only hope now is to put Messi back on the spot. Messi does well to hold off the challenge of former Arsenal defender Clichy at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday .","Lionel Messi was at his stunning best as Barcelona beat Manchester City .

"Beth Whaanga received an enormous amount of international support after she bore her cancer surgery scars in a nude photo shoot in February . Tackling head on the ravages of her cancer surgery a Brisbane mother-of-four has bared all in a bid to raise awareness of breast cancer. Refusing to hide her scarred body following a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery, Ms Whaanga decided to share photos of her post-surgery body on Facebook. After posting the photos, Mrs Whaanga received a huge backlash, with more than 100 people unfriending her. Last year on her 32nd birthday, Mrs Whaanga was diagnosed with breast cancer and doctors found she had the BRCA2 gene. The gene, which predisposes women to breast cancer, saw Angelina Jolie undergo a double mastectomy after discovering she carried it. Miss Jolie announced in May she had undergone the surgery to prevent the risk of gene-related breast cancer. After her surgery in November, Mrs Whaanga refused to hide her body. Instead she teamed up with friend and photographer Nadia Masot, to photograph her body and illustrate the devastation of surgery as part of the Under the Red Dress project. The images were then posted Mrs Whaanga’s Facebook page, where she warned her friends about the confronting material. 'These images are confronting and contain topless material,' she posted. 'They are not in any way meant to be sexual. The aim of this project is to raise awareness for breast cancer. If you find these images offensive please hide them from your feed. 'Each day we walk past people. These individuals appear normal but under their clothing sometimes their bodies tell a different story. 'She added that self-examination was vital. 'It can happen to you,' she posted. One commentator Andrew Young said Facebook was not the platform for the photographs. 'I . personally do not agree with posting confronting pictures on a site . where people do not get a choice whether they wish to view it, as . happened to me when scrolling through my news feed,' he posted. This may . also occur to children scrolling through their feed.' Mrs . Whaanga responded by saying everyone was entitled to their opinion, . while Ms Masot defended the photos by reminding people that cancer did . not discriminate. Mrs Whaanga has undergone a double mastectomy and full hysterectomy in November last year after being diagnosed with breast cancer . 'For the people who think it’s 'just not for them' may just end up being the one who will wish one day they'd payed a bit more attention when it happens to them, only worse because they chose to be offended instead of listening,' Ms Masot posted. 'Ignorance is never a better option.' Mrs Whaanga told The Courier-Mail she was glad she posed for the photos. 'And after the surgery I feel that I will live longer, and that is the best thing for not just me but for my family,' she said, . 'I really wouldn’t want to . take away from people who are fighting that fight against breast cancer; . I was really fortunate given my family history and gene mutation that . my cancer wasn’t as aggressive as others have suffered.' Despite the images being reported to Facebook, Mrs Whaanga has been advised the images will not be removed. Hoping others will share their cancer stories, Mrs Whaanga and Ms Masot are looking for people to take part in the project. Ms Masot said there had already been some interest from those wanting to take part. Confronting: Many of Mrs Whaanga's Facebook friends were offended by the images . Despite the images being reported to Facebook, the social network has promised that they will not be removed . 'We're hoping to turn it into an exhibition and coffee table book,' she said. She said while the images were confronting, the project's message was the focus. ""We're concerned about getting out the message of being vigilant and responsible for our own bodies through confronting imagery,"" she said. 'It was always going to be a bit controversial and we're completely OK with people not being comfortable with that.' Ms Masot said the project's success exceeded its expected reach. 'We just decided to do a campaign - we never anticipated the reach so suddenly,' she said. 'Even in my own photography I was thirsty to work on something more meaningful - cancer is an experience with life changing results.' THE GENES THAT COULD LEAD TO CANCER . BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that produce tumor suppressor proteins. The proteins help repair damaged DNA and ensure the stability of cells' genetic material . A woman’s lifetime risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer increases if she inherits a harmful mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 . About 12 per cent of women in the general population will develop breast cancer in their lives, while about 55 to 65 per cent of women who inherit a BRCA1 mutation and around 45 per cent who inherit a BRCA2 mutation will develop breast cancer by 70 . About 1.4 per cent of women in the general population will develop ovarian cancer in their lives, while about 39 per cent of women who inherit a harmful BRCA1 mutation and about 11 to 17 per cent who inherit a BRCA2 mutation will develop ovarian cancer by 70 . Tests that look for a known mutation in one of the genes and tests that check for all possible mutations in both genes are available . As BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are relatively rare in the general population, those with a possible family history suggests are candidates for testing .","Beth Whaanga underwent a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction .

"Ian Carmichael said Anne Hathaway's pixie cut was the worst hairstyle of the year . His most famous client has worn her hair in a barely-changing short style for decades. But the Queen’s hairdresser is adamant that most women in their mid-40s and beyond are making a big mistake by having their hair cut short in a bid to turn back the clock. Ian Carmichael, Her Majesty’s personal stylist for the past 15 years, says women of a certain age believe they are too old for tousled tresses. Yet many celebrities would have lost their sex appeal years ago had they chopped their hair short, he claims. ‘Women in their mid-40s and 50s at one time would rush to cut their hair off. It was like they became wives, mothers, a “certain age” and they cut it all off,’ he said. ‘But actually hundreds of women, as long as their hair is healthy and in good condition, look much better with soft long hair.’ He chose two actresses who are still glamorous at 62 to illustrate his point. ‘Jane Seymour for example is a woman of a certain age who has worked having lovely long hair,’ he said. ‘If she had had it all cut off at the age of 40 she would have lost her sex appeal years ago. Lorraine Chase is another example of this, she has beautiful hair. ‘Big hair, sexy curls are all in at the moment. Women are finally moving away from straight, sleek hair and embracing movement and texture and it is much better. ‘Women are choosing to go for  the Brigitte Bardot sex-kitten look  and I think they are finding it very empowering – being sexy is the new power-dressing.’ Mr Carmichael derided Anne Hathaway’s boyish pixie crop as the worst haircut of the past year. The American actress ditched her long locks for her Oscar-winning role as Fantine in the film musical Les Miserables. ‘It really doesn’t do a lot for her features,’ Mr Carmichael said. ‘Much like Julia Roberts, her mouth is far too big for a short haircut.’ However, he doesn’t mind short styles on most younger women and welcomes the influence of Downton Abbey and the latest film version of The Great Gatsby. ‘The waved bob of the 1920s is really coming back, the flapper look… the bob has become glamorous again, which is really exciting,’ he said. ‘Downton Abbey is so popular and young women are looking at these once old-fashioned looks and are thinking actually that look is cool, that look is sexy. Five or six years ago everyone was attacking their hair with straightening irons. Mr Carmichael, 51, is dicreet when it comes to disclosing the secrets behind the Queen's hairstyle. He praised Jane Seymour for keep her lon locks at the age of 62 . It is lovely that young girls are embracing the curl.’ Mr Carmichael,  51, who started his hairdressing career in his native Scotland as a  16-year-old trainee, says X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger has the nicest hair he has cut. ‘It’s all hers and it has never been coloured. Just beautiful to work with.’ But, not surprisingly, he adds: ‘Of all my clients, the Queen is by far my favourite, she has wonderful hair.’ He tends the Queen’s hair twice a week – often travelling the country to places such as the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk to do so. However, he remains discreet about the monarch, who awarded him a Royal Warrant last year, refusing to gossip. ‘I did her hair on Monday. I have done her hair for a very long time and I remain loyal to her,’ he said. Mr Carmichael made his comments at the launch of a new range of Sleep-In Rollers, for which he is an ambassador.","Ian Carmichael has worked on the Queen's hair for the past 15 years .

"A star of Channel 4's Shameless must pay vast damages to a trainee plumber he left brain-damaged after hurling him from the bonnet of his BMW, the High Court ruled today. Elliott Tittensor crumpled on a court bench in tears today as he lost a case for up to £300,000 - which he will have to pay out of his own pocket because he had no car insurance. The claim was brought by trainee plumber Oliver Flint, who was just 18 when he was blinded in one eye and given severe head injuries during the late-night row outside a McDonald's in 2010. A judge heard the argument began with the actor refusing to let Mr Flint use his phone - and led to him splitting with his then-girlfriend, Skins star Kaya Scodelario, three years later. Payout: Elliott Tittensor (left) has lost a £300,000 case brought by Oliver Flint (right), who was just 18 when he was blinded in one eye during a late-night row which led the actor to split with Kaya Scodelario (with him left) Now 25, Mr Tittensor said the trainee plumber drunkenly harassed Ms Scodelario and jumped on his bonnet, forcing him to drive off in self-defence. But Mr Justice Edis ruled in the plumber's favour, telling the High Court: 'The decision to which I have come is that Mr Flint succeeds in his claim against Mr Tittensor for battery'. Although he was cautioned and interviewed on suspicion of attempted murder, Mr Tittensor's only criminal conviction in court was to be fined £750 for driving without insurance, the court heard. Mr Flint, now 22, insisted that Mr Tittensor caused his head injuries outside the restaurant in Kentish Town, north London, which prompted a permanent personality change. Today’s decision guarantees Mr Flint substantial compensation, though the value of his payout has not yet been decided. Mr Justice Edis will give detailed reasons for his decision at a later date. Evidence: Actor Mr Tittensor arrives at the High Court to give his side of the story yesterday . Earlier Mr Tittensor wept in court as his Skins star ex-girlfriend described the end of their relationship. Kaya Scodelario paused work on the next Pirates of the Caribbean film to support her ex of five years in the High Court. Ms Scodelario, who rose to fame playing Effy Stonem in Skins, appeared via video link from Australia, where she is filming Pirates of the Caribbean 5, to support her ex-boyfriend in court. The pair were dating at the time and Ms Scodelario was left abandoned in the McDonald's when her actor boyfriend 'fled the scene'. She has told the court that what happened that night led to her and Mr Tittensor breaking up in 2013. She is now engaged to actor Benjamin Walker. Dressed in a loose, white, scoop-necked blouse, she told Mr Justice Edis: 'Elliott is a very kind human being. 'We were boyfriend and girlfriend for five and a half years. He is an extremely gentle person. 'He is incredibly kind to his family and they are a wonderful family who welcomed me in'. Telling the judge about the end of their relationship and its aftermath, she added: 'We continue to have a very civil, warm communication with each other. 'That cannot be said of most couples who are not together any more, and that says a lot about his character.' Mr Tittensor wiped away tears as his ex-girlfriend spoke, his face crumpling with emotion as he watched her on the screen. Telling the judge about the incident, she said that when she next saw her ex-boyfriend at her north London flat, his first thoughts were for her and the badly injured Mr Flint. 'Elliott was immediately concerned for Oliver's well being,' she said. 'I have never seen him be aggressive to anyone. 'He was very shaken up and frightened, and above all concerned for me that I had been attacked. 'I could see he was panicked about whether Oliver was okay, after falling off the bonnet of the car, because he couldn't see and didn't know what state he was in.' Couple: Shameless star Elliott Tittensor and his then-girlfriend, Skins star Kaya Scodelario, split in 2013 . She also told the judge that she had bumped into Mr Flint, who lives in the same area of north London in which she grew up, twice in nightclubs since the incident. She said that Mr Flint was 'not aggressive' on either of those occasions, but that she 'asked the people he was with if he was going to attack me'. She added: 'I said I didn't want to be attacked, or my friends or family to be attacked. 'He said we ruined his chance of being on Big Brother, on Channel Four, and he was devastated about that.' Mr Tittensor, who played Carl Gallagher in Shameless, previously described the trainee plumber as 'harassing'  his then-girlfriend before the alleged attack. She told the judge: 'I felt him following me, which is something I find intimidating, and he was very loud and aggressive. Scene: The incident happened nearly five years ago outside this McDonald's in Kentish Town, north London . 'I was an 18-year-old girl on her own being followed by a large man, shouting. It was very traumatic and dramatic for me.' Asked by Andrew Roy, for Mr Flint, how she would have expected Mr Tittensor to react to a perceived threat or harassment towards her, she said: 'Obviously, with the job we chose, we gave up part of our right to defend ourselves. 'We are both very intelligent and very mature and we both think it is better to take the high ground and ignore incidents and not make eye contact.' The screen couple dated five and a half years and Ms Scodelario has starred in The Maze Runner. Mr Flint, 22, of Archway, north London, is accusing Mr Tittensor of 'trespass against the person' by manoeuvring his car in a way which threw him from the bonnet. Cult hit: Elliott Tittensor (far right) was one of the longest-running faces in the bleak Channel 4 drama . Gritty: Mr Tittensor in a scene from Shameless (above), in which he starred for several years with his twin . Mr Tittensor, from Heywood, Lancashire, insists that he was in fear of Mr Flint - who the actor described as 'a drunk, crazy person trying to beat through my windscreen'. He says that he acted entirely reasonably in self defence. Mr Tittensor earlier told the judge: 'I had what appeared to be a drunk, crazy person trying to beat through my windscreen and attack me. 'It looked like he was trying to do his best to do that. I've just tried to be as honest as possible. I felt like he was trying to kill me.' 'I've never been in a situation like that before in my entire life.' The High Court hearing continues.","Elliott Tittensor has lost £300k High Court claim by victim Oliver Flint .

"Everyone knows an estate agent’s claims should always be treated with caution. But one firm really stretched the limits of imagination – by claiming Luton was a suburb of London. RE/MAX Property Centre’s advert said its luxury flats in the Bedfordshire town were ‘close to one of the world’s leading financial districts and in one of the most cosmopolitan areas of London’. In the heart of London? An advert for these £500,000 flats in Luton boasted that they have the 'City's famous landmarks  right on your doorstep' - despite a season ticket to the capital costing almost £4,000 . Salubrious: The site of the flats, which will overlook a dual carriageway, court, pub and shopping centre . Generous: The advert which prompted bemusement from councillors... and clarified the distance further down . It went on: ‘Many of the city’s famous landmarks, extensive transport routes, social and cultural attractions right on your doorstep . . . it’s the way you’ve always imagined city living to be.’ That seems unlikely, because Luton is 35 miles from London – or a 23-minute train journey, for which a season ticket costs all of £3,924. Going by car takes far longer, partly thanks to M1 traffic. The 130 flats and 359 student rooms overlook a busy dual carriageway, a casino, a pub and the crown court – but a two-bed penthouse costs £534,751, while one-bedroom flats are £354,000. RE/MAX Property Centre is selling the flats for Sloane International Developers. Last night, it altered the advert text after MailOnline highlighted the disparity. Luxury: Computer-aided images of how the Luton flats' developers believe they will look inside . Chic: There has been a surge in demand for modern flats as pressure increases on London housing . Glossy: Despite there being CGI interior images, the flats themselves will only be finished next year . Romantic: The flats will include a view of Luton town centre from the floor-to-ceiling windows . One Luton local, who asked not to be named, said yesterday: ‘I’m proud of where I’m from, but there aren’t many social and cultural attractions near my doorstep. 'They must be hoping rich foreign students will buy the flats without checking the details.’ Visitor Rachel Watts, 28, said: ‘I know London’s expensive but you could buy a two-bed apartment for half a million quid couldn’t you? Why spend it here?’ Tom Shaw, the local councillor responsible for housing, said high prices in London meant people were moving to Luton, pushing the cost of ex-council houses to £170,000. But he said £500,000 even for high-end flats required ‘a bit of imagination’. ‘For a property on a flyover opposite student accommodation, I don’t know who would list it for that,’ he said. The flats, complete with gym and 24-hour concierge, have not yet been built, but are due to be completed in 2016. A condition of planning permission was that the project would include affordable housing, and student rooms will be available from £56,000. Development: The three blocks are symbolic of a rush to buy housing in the commuter belt . Use your imagination: The site of the development, where prices will start at £56,000 for a small student room . Car park: A councillor said paying the £535,000 price would 'need a little bit of imagination' The development is not the only thing in the area to lean rather heavily on its link to the capital – for years, London Luton Airport has been confusing tourists, who arrive in the UK only to find they still have a long journey ahead. Luton topped a list of Britain’s worst places to live in the book Crap Towns II in 2004. Some 1,800 people voted it the grimmest place in the UK. Despite it having 185,000 residents at the time, just five wrote in to defend it. RE/MAX said the market for the flats was typically investors in China and Malaysia. Owner Tim Marshall said he would modify the description in the ad. He said: ‘We apologise for the error, and trust that this typographical error can be treated as such and was not a deliberate attempt to mislead.’ LONDON OXFORD AIRPORT . Also known as Kidlington Airport, it was controversially rebranded in 2009 despite being 60 miles from the capital. LONDON ASHFORD AIRPORT . It was renamed in a bid to turn it into a thriving regional hub, despite being in Lydd, Kent - half an hour's drive from Ashford. Ashford is then 38 minutes by high-speed train, or well over an hour normally, from London. LONDON STANSTED AIRPORT . Aside from being 40 miles from the capital, the airport's Stansted Express was rapped by the advertising watchdog in 2010 when it claimed trains took just 35 minutes to reach London. The destination was actually Tottenham Hale, eight miles from the West End. MK DONS . There was a row over the team relocating in 2003 to Milton Keynes from Wimbledon, the origin of the 'Dons' in its name. The name remained, but the club relinquished all claim to its history and returned old trophies to London. ...AND 'LONDON PRESTWICK' AIRPORT .

"Former Scotland football captain Colin Hendry has been given a harassment warning after allegedly pestering his ex-girlfriend. The 49-year-old former defender began seeing beautician Sarah Kinder after his wife Denise died aged 42 in 2009 following surgery to correct botched liposuction. The warning does not count as a criminal record, but runs for a year to stop a person's conduct in the future causing distress. Police action: Former Scotland captain Colin Hendry (pictured) has been handed a harassment warning . In his pomp: Hendry tackling Brazil's Ronaldo when captain of Scotland at the 1998 World Cup in France . According to The Sun and the BBC the warning refers to Ms Kinder, who Hendry began dating in 2010 and who helped him rebuild his life after his wife's death. A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: 'A 49-year-old man from Lytham has been given an harassment warning.' Hendry, who lives in Lytham, Lancashire, is due in court in Blackpool on March 4 charged with drink-driving over a separate incident. The former defender played for Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers and Rangers and captained Scotland in the 1998 World Cup, which saw the team knocked out in the group stage. Since his career, which also involved playing for Bolton Wanderers and Blackpool and being named player of the year in 1989-90, he has turned coach and managed Blackpool and Clyde. His personal life prompted headlines and widespread sympathy in 2009 when he lost his wife Denise to a hospital infection, which caused meningitis in her brain which killed her. Marriage: Hendry with wife Denise, who died in 2009 after surgery to correct a botched liposuction operation . She fell ill following a routine operation to correct liposuction which had gone badly wrong seven years earlier, puncturing her bowel and leaving her in regular pain. Speaking to the Scottish Express in 2010, Hendry said meeting Ms Kinder had helped him and his children pick up the pieces of their lives. 'With all the troubles I’ve got in my life and am battling through... as a family we are just trying to take our lives forward,' he said. 'Life will never be the same for us again... The majority of people who know what has happened in my life will be sympathetic to any good news I have.'

Harry has spent much of the last few months promoting the Games, even agreeing to a rare interview on Radio 2 last week in which he spoke of his pride in the event and his wish to repeat it for 'as long as it's needed'. The Games, which open on the 10th September, will also feature a celebrity-studded closing ceremony courtesy of a concert headlined by the Foo Fighters and the Kaiser Chiefs.

"A family of jobless refugees who allegedly wrecked a £1.25million house paid for by the taxpayer claim they are ‘entitled’ to live there. Manal Mahmoud and her seven children moved into the Victorian end-of-terrace home after it was given a £76,000 facelift. But yesterday the Palestinian immigrants were branded the ‘family from hell’ by nearby residents as it emerged that they face eviction from the three-bedroom property in Fulham, West London, for their ‘appalling behaviour’. Eviction? Manal Mahmoud moved into this upmarket Fulham . address following a £76,000 refit - half of which was paid for by public . money - almost three years ago but there are claims it has been 'trashed' by the family . Shortly after journalists arrived at the house the police were seen knocking on the door. It is not known why they were there . It follows complaints to police about . anti-social behaviour at the property, where the driveway has been . smashed up, doors are hanging off and rubbish and furniture have been . dumped in the garden. Although the family claim they do not . have the money to maintain the house, they drive a Mercedes and  the . house is fitted with expensive electronic goods including a widescreen . plasma television and a laptop computer. Yesterday Mrs Mahmoud, who came to . Britain in 2000 with her husband before they split up, said she was . living with six of her children aged between five and 17. Her 19-year-old son Ossama is in prison for drug dealing. She added: ‘I am entitled to live in a house like this, even if I don’t pay for it and get benefits. ‘It is fair that the Government houses us. ‘I know I have a son who makes trouble but that doesn’t mean all my children are the same. ‘Neighbours are complaining because . the landlord rented the house to council tenants – they  don’t want a . foreigner to live in  this street.’ Angry: A young man thought to be one of Mrs Mahmoud's sons came out of the house and swore at photographers outside . 'Family from hell': Their Landlord wants to throw them out of the house because of the family's poor behaviour and alleged damage to the property . Mrs Mahmoud, who gained British citizenship in 2005, admitted that the inside of the house had not been taken care of. Taxpayers partially footed the bill for a new kitchen and roof along with decoration costs before the family moved in three years ago. ‘I know the house doesn’t look its best,’ she said. ‘I don’t try to maintain and repair the house, I don’t fix the tiles or paint the walls. ‘I haven’t got enough money – I  only have my benefits. I don’t care if people think I am not grateful.’ Now she could face eviction after the landlord of the three-bedroom property, Sue Cummings, apparently found . the home had been 'trashed'. Ms Cummings, who agreed to let council tenants live in her home in the leafy street close to the River Thames, apparently found doors missing or hanging off and walls written on. The driveway had also been smashed up, wallpaper was off and carpet worn through, the Sun said. Outside, the lawn was overgrown, furniture left in the front garden and rubbish and motorbike parts strewn around. Yesterday neighbours described the Mahmouds as ‘the family from hell’. One said: ‘The place looks an absolute mess. The furniture has been out in the garden for months.’ A view of the leafy road in upmarket Fulham where the family live. Neighbours say the family are the 'family from hell' while the council has said their behaviour is 'appalling' and they could be evicted . When MailOnline called her address the family insisted they did not have any comment to make. Meanwhile, . Ms Cummings said she was too upset to talk about the damage to her . home, which only had a new kitchen and roof put in in 2009. Hammersmith and Fulham Council said it may fight to evict the family at a court hearing on Thursday. Deputy council leader Greg Smith . said: 'We have warned this family that they face eviction if their . appalling behaviour does not improve. 'There is a court hearing fixed for Thursday and we are working hard to resolve this matter.' It's not the first time plush homes lived in by benefit claimants have come under the spotlight. In 2010 it emerged that a family of Somalian asylum seekers, including Abdi Nur, right, received a home worth £1.2m in Kensington, London, left, after saying their previous home had been in a 'poor' part of the city . In February it emerged that at least . 100 families receiving housing benefit were living in luxury homes on . handouts that could fund £1m mortgages. More than 30 of those families were . being given £1,500 a week to live 'swanky' lifestyles - more than three . times the national average wage. Of the 100 families, 60 have their rent . paid by the state to the value of £5,000 a month, according to the . Department for Work and Pensions. In 2010 it emerged that a family of Somalian asylum seekers were getting £1.2m a year to live in Kensington, west London - a short walk from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's home in Kensington Palace. Abdi Nur, 42, an unemployed bus conductor, his wife Sayruq, 40, and their seven children moved to the three-storey home in the fashionable area of the capital after complaining that their previous home had been in a 'poor' part of the city. In another case last year, a Somalian family moved from a house in Coventry to a £2m property in West Hampstead, north London. Saeed Khaliiff was given £2,000 a week for the home despite having no links to the area, which has been home to George Michael, Sienna Miller, Jude Law and Helena Bonham Carter. Meanwhile, Afghan mother of seven Toorpakai Saindi was handed £12,000 in housing benefit a month to be able to live in a £1.2million mansion in Acton, west London as there weren't enough council houses big enough.","Manal Mahmoud moved into the Fulham address following a £76,000 refit .

"At Parc des Princes on Saturday, Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrated his second-minute strike by peeling off his Paris Saint-Germain shirt to reveal the names of 50 of the people closest to his heart. Carmen, Rahma, Antoine, Lida, Chheuy, Marki and others had been carefully (and temporarily) inked on to the forward’s torso as part of an initiative for the United Nations World Food Programme. ‘These are the people nobody cheers for,’ he announces in a moving video, set to the music of Jonsi’s soft-rock track Tornado, that has already attracted more than 1.1million YouTube views. VIDEO - Scroll down to see Ibrahimovic's World Food Programme promotion . PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic 'tattooed' the names of 50 starving people from around the world on his torso . Paris Saint Germain manager Laurent Blanc spoke ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash with Chelsea . Ibrahimovic took off his shirt in support of the United Nations World Food Program after scoring against Caen . One of Ibrahimovic's tattoos on his back represents the Japanese koi, which swims against the current . 1 Left and right wrists: ‘Ibrahimovic Code’ - birthdates of his family. The right wrist shows when his father, older brother, younger brother and two sons were born. 2 Right arm: Arabic fonts: his father’s name ‘Sefik’ and son’s names ‘Maximilian’ and ‘Vincent’. 3 Left arm: Shows the birthdates of his mother and big sister. He used the right arm for the men as it is stronger, and the left arm for the women as it is closer to his heart. 4 Right stomach: Two playing cards — ace of hearts with the letter ‘H’ — believed to represent his fiancee Helena Seger. Ace of clubs represents spirituality (these cards are also considered good luck symbols). 5 Right side: Red dragon is a metaphor for his personality — in Japanese the dragon represents a warrior. 6 Left side: ‘Only God Can Judge Me’ – inset. 7 Chest and stomach: 50 names that represent the 805million starving people — the names include ‘Antoine’, ‘Omar’ and ‘Yovana’ — to raise awareness of suffering in accordance with the World Food Programme. 8 Left arm: Mother’s name ‘Jurka’ 9 Left shoulder: Japanese koi — a carp that ‘swims against the current’, a symbol of masculinity. 10 Mid-upper back: Feather — origins in Native America, thought to be from an eagle and representing strength and courage. 11 Upper right back: Yant Prajao Khao Nirote — Buddhist for protection from suffering. 12 Right shoulder: Maori tribal symbol to protect himself and his family. 13 Lower left back: Leonardo Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man — his interpretation of, proportionally speaking, the perfect human form. 14 Mid-back: Buddhist ‘Five Deva Faces Yantra’ — represents the five elements. ‘These are the people nobody cheers for,’ he announces in a moving video, set to the music of Jonsi’s soft-rock track Tornado, that has already attracted more than 1.1million YouTube views. He is shown sitting in the dressing room in quiet contemplation ahead of kick-off against Caen before he walks down the tunnel to be met by 45,571 supporters inside the stadium. ‘Whenever you see me you will see them,’ he adds as part of a campaign to highlight the 805m people around the world who are affected by hunger. ‘They are struck by war, by disaster and extreme poverty.’ For a footballer with Ibrahimovic’s profile, there was no better place to spread his message than the Parc des Princes just moments after he had scored against Caen. Ibrahimovic trains on Monday ahead of PSG's key clash against Chelsea on Tuesday night . The striker will lead the line for the French champions up against John Terry and Co . ‘When I took my shirt off against Caen, everybody asked what these new tattoos were,’ he revealed. ‘I had 50 removable tattoos on my body, they are the names of real people who are suffering from hunger in the world. While those tattoos have gone now, these people are still here... I hope you can see them through me.’ He was booked for the gesture, somewhat reluctantly, by referee Franck Schneider and will now miss PSG’s Ligue One clash with Monaco. Tensions are running high in this team and although PSG coach Laurent Blanc respects Ibrahimovic’s humanitarian mission, there was a sting in the tail when he spoke on Monday. Despite the sentiment the striker was booked for his celebration, as the laws of the game dictate . Blanc (left) spoke with the press alongside PSG centre back and former Chelsea defender David Luiz (right) Ibrahimovic has scored twice in the Champions League this term, including one against old club Barcelona . Blanc said: ‘I knew about the project, but not the tattoos. I knew something was planned at the end of the game, but nothing more. ‘He scored early, he took off his shirt and was booked. It was good to promote the association, but it did cost us a yellow card. Imagine if he got another after 20 minutes? We may as well have abandoned the game in the 70th minute because we would have been down to seven men. ‘I don’t know whether him taking off his shirt was good for us. If he scores against Chelsea I hope he doesn’t take off his shirt because he will be booked again.’ Ibrahimovic’s goal against Caen, in a 2-2 draw, was a typical, improvised finish with an outstretched leg. The scoreline was not good, but Ibrahimovic’s goal was a nice way to warm up ahead of this evening’s first leg. Last season the legendary Sweden forward won the 11th league title of his incredible career and yet the Champions League has eluded him. There was a period when the European Cup meant everything to him, the holy grail in a life that has taken him to Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, Milan and PSG. He says he will end his career here. Off the field his influence continues to grow, to the point where he even felt able to alter the words to the national anthem, in a campaign for Volvo in collaboration with acclaimed Swedish songwriter Max Martin. Ibrahimovic remains the driver of PSG, the main man in a team who have struggled to move into European football’s fast lane. He played in PSG’s 3-1 victory here last season, a peripheral figure as goals from Ezequiel Lavezzi, an own goal by David Luiz and Javier Pastore’s 90th-minute strike sealed an impressive win. The forward, Sweden’s player of the year for the eighth successive year, was at Stamford Bridge for the second leg but missed the 2-0 defeat through injury. Striker Ibrahimovic missed PSG's 2-0 defeat to Chelsea in the Champions League last year as he was injured . Ibrahimovic (left) enjoyed working under Jose Mourinho (right) when they pair were at Inter Milan . His affection for Jose Mourinho developed during the season they spent together at Inter before Ibrahimovic left for Barcelona in 2009. When these teams met in the quarter-final last season, Ibrahimovic accepted his chances to finally get his hands on the trophy could well have passed by. Given his philanthropic gestures, it is clear his work for the United Nations means just as much to him.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic took off his shirt in support of the World Food Program .

"A forthcoming United Nations-organised conference on communications poses a grave threat to the freedom of the internet, Google has warned. The Silicon Valley search giant said the December gathering of the UN's International Telecommunications Union comes amid 'a growing backlash on Internet freedom'. The World Conference on International Communications in Dubai will update global telecom rules for the first time since 1988, and some countries see this as an opportunity to set up new rules for the Internet. Behind closed doors: Google has warned that the planned meeting of the UN's International Telecommunications Union comes amid 'a growing backlash on Internet freedom' There are fears proposals made by China, Russia and other nations could threaten the open model of Internet governance by giving the UN a greater role. Oversight of the net's domain name system and technical specifications is currently undertaken by U.S.-based bodies, but some countries want an international organisation to take responsibility. Google's statement said 'the ITU is the wrong place to make decisions about the future of the Internet' because 'only governments have a voice at the ITU,' including some 'that do not support a free and open Internet.' 'The ITU is also secretive,' Google said. 'The treaty conference and proposals are confidential.' Google said some proposed treaty changes 'permit governments to censor legitimate speech — or even allow them to cut off Internet access'. Others, the company warned, 'would require services like YouTube, Facebook, and Skype to pay new tolls in order to reach people across borders. 'This could limit access to information - particularly in emerging markets.' Champion of free speech? Google's position chimes with that of the U.S., which wants the institutions that govern the internet to remain in America . Google's comments backed the U.S. position, which is that the non-government 'multi-stakeholder' system of the Internet should remain in place. 'Governments alone should not determine the future of the Internet,' the Google blog said. 'The billions of people around the globe that use the Internet, and the experts that build and maintain it, should be included.' Google last week admitted that it had received - and complied with - a record number of requests from governments to reveal information about its users this year. The latest edition of the search giant's Transparency Report shows governments around the world made nearly 21,000 requests to access its data in the first six months of 2012. The U.S. government made the most demands, asking for users' details 7,969 times between January and June this year. The UK came sixth - behind Germany and France - with 1,425 requests. 'This is the sixth time we’ve released this data, and one trend has become clear: Government surveillance is on the rise,' Dorothy Chou, a senior policy analyst for Google, said in a blog post. 'In the first half of 2012, there were 20,938 inquiries from government entities around the world. Those requests were for information about 34,614 accounts.' The ITU has however said that countries attending the meeting could invite whoever they wise to be part of their delegations at the meeting, the BBC reported. The Google response comes a week after Russia submitted its proposal to the ITU suggesting the U.S. should have less control over the net, provoking strong reactions from some online activists. The Russian proposal said: 'Member states shall have equal rights to manage the internet, including in regard to the allotment, assignment and reclamation of internet numbering, naming, addressing and identification resources and to support for the operation and development of basic internet infrastructure.' Currently, these internet infrastructure matters are dealt with by non-profit bodies ultimately answerable to the U.S. Department of Commerce, but which in effect are suppoed to operate at arm's length from the U.S. government. Larry Downes, an analyst with the Bell Mason Group consultancy who follows technology issues, said the Russian proposal 'makes explicit' Moscow's desire to bring the Internet under greater control of the UN agency and diminish the role of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which manages the Internet address system. 'The Russian federation's proposal... would in specific substantially if not completely change the role of ICANN in overseeing domain names and IP addresses,' Downes said in a blog post. 'Of course the Russian Federation, along with other repressive governments, uses every opportunity to gain control over the free flow of information, and sees the Internet as its most formidable enemy.' U.S. ambassador to the ITU Terry Kramer has already signalled he would not support the proposals from Russia. He has said the existing institutions have 'functioned effectively and will continue to ensure the health and growth of the internet'.","Nations meet next month to decide first update to telecom rules since 1988 .

"Alan Pardew revealed he quit Newcastle United because of the financial constraints placed on him by owner Mike Ashley. Pardew said: ‘Newcastle is a big club, it’s difficult because it is run on a tight financial margin. We had to work hard on transfers, the funds for a club that size makes it difficult to understand that we had to build slowly. ‘I am under no illusions - the football community and there was a concern about it. It was the right time for Newcastle but this was my decision. Alan Pardew smiles for the camera during his unveiling as manager of the south London club . Newcastle  owner Mike Ashley and Pardew did not see eye to eye on financial aspects of the squad . Pardew takes in the views at Selhurst Park where he'll manage Crystal Palace, who are in the relegation zone . ‘Steve Parish met the clause in my contract and I hope this is the right decision. ‘Four years under that monetary situation, along with the history, made it difficult. I have left it with a good base of players. ‘I want to thank all Geordies. My resilience and character has grown because of the nature of the club.’ Pardew is now Palace manager and he insists success this season will be judged on keeping the team in the Barclays Premier League. Alan Pardew acknowledges the travelling Crystal Palace fans in the FA Cup at Dover, his first game in charge . Pardew, with Newcastle owner Mike Ashley (right), claims the financial constraints were too much at the club . He added: ‘The most important welcome was from the staff and the players. They have told me what the need and that information is important. ‘The players have a tremendous attitude. We have a tough challenge, we are in the bottom three with 18 games to go. ‘Our home form is not good and we have to change that. The players need a lift, maybe a signing or two could do that. ‘Realistically one place above relegation would be success. We need between 35-40 points to stay up. Scott Dann celebrates with team-mates after scoring Crystal Palace's opener against Dover on Sunday . ‘There is a feeling among the players that they can do it. We need that belief to start with. ‘The chairman and the board are keen to bring a player or two and they are working hard towards that. It is complicated in the Premier League, especially to sign a striker. 'We need funding and he gave me some assurances that it would be there.' Palace next face in form Tottenham, who are currently fifth in the Premier League, but Pardew is hoping a raucous Selhurst Park can help: ‘When you are fighting relegation you don’t want to play teams in red hot form. They are. The place will be jumping and we need to exploit that.’ Pardew joined Palace with the club in the relegation zone and is adamant he can turn it around: 'I had one year of it at Charlton and we struggled one year at Newcastle because we were in the Europa League. Pardew waves to the away supporters during Crystal Palace's FA Cup trip to Dover on Sunday afternoon . ‘I am going to try to change our style a little bit, but it won’t happen quickly. ‘I don't think any Palace fan would stop me dreaming of a club where I thought we could win trophies with a difficult situation and a difficult agenda. ‘I want to prove that I am a top manager in this division. It would have been easier to stay at Newcastle and get a top ten finish. I have decided to take this challenge. 'I don’t think any Newcastle can hold it against me - some thought we had an opinion that we did well with what we had. ‘What I know is that on day one I have 99.9 per cent of the Palace fans but it won’t last long if we do not serve up the best possible football we can. That is what I am going to try to do. ‘I won’t do a lap of honour to try to get the fans going, but I want to see something different.' Crystal Palace winger Jason Puncheon had to be restrained by team-mate Barry Bannan (right) at the darts . Pardew has spoken to Palace winger Jason Puncheon regarding an incident at the PDC World Darts Championships at Alexandra Palace at the weekend, revealed by Sportsmail columnist Charles Sale, when Barry Bannan had to restrain his team mate from a confrontation with fans. 'We have had an incident this week with Jason Puncheon and I have reminded him that he has a responsibility as a Crystal Palace player. 'His behaviour was inappropriate and I have told him that. We have some fantastic role models in the Premier League.' With the transfer window open, many clubs could be interested in Palace winger Yannick Bolasie who has been in fine form for the Eagles this season but Pardew dismissed any move: 'It would take an extraordinary bid to take him away from this football club given the situation we are currently in.' Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew has claimed it would take an 'extraordinary bid' for Yannick Bolasie to leave .","Alan Pardew became manager of Crystal Palace at the start of January .

"There were times at Selhurst Park on Thursday afternoon when Alan Pardew gave the impression that there was so much more he wanted to say about the four years he spent at Newcastle. The new Crystal Palace manager made it clear that the supporters at St James’ Park - ‘I’d be foolish to pretend everything was hunky dory and I was happy-go-lucky’ - got on his goat. Resilience. Character. Strength. Pressure. Bravery. They were his buzzwords at his Palace unveiling and it felt as though he had memorised them. Alan Pardew smiles for the camera during his unveiling as manager of the south London club . Newcastle United  owner Mike Ashley (right) and Pardew did not see eye to eye on financial aspects . ‘My resilience and character have grown because of the nature of Newcastle as a club,’ said Pardew. ‘Four years under that monetary situation, along with the history, made it difficult. It was the right time (to leave) for Newcastle and the right time for me. ‘You have to deliver but that doesn’t mean it goes away. ‘Defeats hurt, particularly defeats in derbies and in the cups. ‘Banning the local media up there didn’t help me. ‘That was difficult and they looked at a lot of negative situations, which didn’t help with the fans. ‘That was stuff I had to put up with and deal with. What I know is that on day one I have 99.9 per cent of the Palace fans but it won’t last if we don’t serve up the best football we can.’ What was clear, despite the trauma of the SackPardew.com campaign, is that he actually has a lot of affection for St James’ Park and the North East. He wanted to be respected and loved, but Newcastle’s fans refused to yield. Pardew takes in the views at Selhurst Park where he'll manage Crystal Palace, who are in the relegation zone . He acknowledges the travelling Crystal Palace fans in the FA Cup at Dover, his first game in charge . ‘I want to prove that I am a top manager in this division,’ he added, ‘and it would have been easier to stay at Newcastle and get a top-10 finish. ‘I managed in a difficult situation and with a difficult agenda.’ That agenda is set by Magpies owner Mike Ashley, who wants to recoup his huge interest-free loan to the club before thinking about building a team for the city to be proud of again. As an aside, Pardew did make it clear that he had control of team selection and the final say on major transfers, with the exception of Yohan Cabaye’s departure last January. Still, he can look forward to a warmer relationship with the supporters at Selhurst Park. He mentioned the Holmesdale Fanatics, the growing group of Palace fans who make a racket for 90 minutes at every home game. It is something Pardew wants to tap in to. Last season he was in the directors’ box when Palace, under Pulis, came back from 0-3 to draw 3-3 with Liverpool and admitted he had been stirred by the atmosphere. Pardew, with Newcastle owner Mike Ashley (right), claims the financial constraints were too much at the club . Scott Dann celebrates with team-mates after scoring Crystal Palace's opener against Dover on Sunday . ‘I couldn’t help but feel enthused, even though I was Newcastle’s manager,’ he said. Pardew is back home, sort of, returning to the club where he made Palace history by scoring the winner in the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool in 1990. ‘It was a day that none of us ever believed we could win,’ he recalled. ‘We over-achieved, against the odds, against one of the finest sides English football has produced. ‘Under Steve Coppell the following season we finished third. It brings strong memories of the red and blue and what Palace should be about - front-foot football - and I want to bring that in, in a structured manner.’ Keeping Palace in the Barclays Premier League is a tougher job than many may believe, but Pardew’s strength is his coaching ability. When his eye is on the ball, he is exceptional on the training ground. Pardew waves to the away supporters during Crystal Palace's FA Cup trip to Dover on Sunday afternoon . Crystal Palace winger Jason Puncheon had to be restrained by team-mate Barry Bannan (right) at the darts . ‘I’m under no illusions but it is my job to set up a football team, to motivate them and to achieve more than they are,’ he added. ‘That is my big strength.’ Pardew has also brought discipline, calling midfielder Jason Puncheon into his office this week after he was involved in an unseemly exchange with a spectator at the PDC World Darts final. ‘I reminded him that he has a responsibility as a Crystal Palace player. His behaviour was inappropriate and I told him,’ said Pardew. This was a good start by Pardew, careful with his farewell words for Newcastle fans while eager to make a fresh start with Palace. As for the rest of it, he will be judged on results.","Alan Pardew became manager of Crystal Palace at the start of January .

"Chelsea Clinton announced today that she has quit her role as a 'special correspondent' for NBC. Bill and Hillary Clinton's daughter had been working sporadically at the network since 2011 after winning a reported $600,000-a-year contract to report on stories featuring people or organizations doing public-spirited work. The network confirmed her exit on Friday. She was initially hired to do stories for Brian Williams' 'Rock Center' news magazine but that program was canceled. Scroll down for video . Quitting: Chelsea Clinton, seen in New York on Wednesday, is quitting her high-profile job at NBC so that she can look after her soon-to-born baby and focus on work with the Clinton Foundation . Clinton's departure from the network will remove any awkwardness for NBC if her mother, Hillary, runs for president in 2016 . Her work occasionally appeared on NBC's Nightly News. Politico magazine reported earlier this year that NBC was paying Clinton $600,000 annually before it was scaled back to a month-to-month deal in January. Her last piece for the network aired on August 1. Politic reported on Friday that Clinton's salary had worked out at an estimated $26,000 for each minute she appeared on air. In a statement on her official Facebook page on Friday, Clinton said: 'To continue focusing on my work at the Clinton Foundation and as Marc and I look forward to welcoming our first child, I have decided to leave my position as a NBC Special Correspondent.' Clinton, 34, and her investment banker husband, Marc Mezvinsky, announced this spring that she was pregnant with the couple's first child. The former first daughter announced she was pregnant with her first child in April and is due to give birth in the fall. Ready to pop? The former First Daughter announced in April that she and her husband of four years were expecting a child . Clinton, 34, and her investment banker husband Marc Mezvinsky live in the Gramercy neighborhood of Manhattan in a $10.5million apartment . Clinton and husband Marc, 36, celebrated their fourth-wedding anniversary at the end of last month. They were married in a lavish inter-faith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York on July 31, 2010. The couple live in a $10.5million condo in the Gramercy area of Manhattan. Alex Wallace, senior vice president at NBC News, praised Clinton today and didn't rule out working with her in the future. She told People: ""Chelsea's storytelling inspired people across the country and showcased the real power we have as individuals to make a difference in our communities. 'While she will be missed, we look forward to working with her in the future.' Her exit removes some potential awkwardness for the network if her mother runs for president in 2016. NBC made certain to keep Clinton off the air around the time her mother was making media appearances to promote a book, to avoid any appearance of conflict. NBC also received some criticism when stories about her salary appeared but the network didn't comment on the reports.

I loved watching the 'Making a Difference' stories about remarkable people and organizations making a profound difference in our country and our world. I am grateful NBC gave me the opportunity to continue this important legacy. To continue focusing on my work at the Clinton Foundation and as Marc and I look forward to welcoming our first child, I have decided to leave my position as a NBC Special Correspondent. At NBC, I've had the opportunity to share the work of people like Carlos 'Coach Khali' Sweeney , whose Downtown Boxing Gym offers kids on the east side of Detroit a lifeline through academic tutoring and boxing instruction. I met Principal Peggy Candelaria, whose Homework Diner in Albuquerque helps kids with their homework and also feeds those same kids and their families, fostering a renewed sense of community, a program that now serves as a model across Albuquerque and beyond. I also spent time with Annette Dove whose TOPPS program in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, continues to fill the hunger, education and safety gaps for kids of all ages in her community. I will always be inspired by their and others' collective passion, courage, ingenuity and perseverance. I am profoundly grateful to NBC viewers who responded to the stories I shared, providing funds to help expand the reach of those programs and who encouraged their schools' principals, their mayors and local activists to think about how to build similarly transformative programs in their own communities.It's been a privilege to be part of the NBC Family. I admire the work and dedication that their reporters, producers, crews, editors and studio teams deliver every day, particularly as I personally experienced through the stewardship of Brian Williams at Nightly News and Rock Center. I especially want to thank Deborah, Alex, Tracey, Catherine, Mary, Victor, Soraya and everyone I had the honor of working with in the field, in the editing room and at Education Nation. While my role with NBC News may be coming to an end, I look forward to working with the NBC family well into the future.","Bill and Hillary's daughter was working on-and-off at the network since 2011 focusing on people and organizations doing public-spirited work .

"Emmanuel Adebayor has put a halt to a possible loan move to QPR because the Tottenham forward has no desire to join the Loftus Road club. Adebayor has told Spurs he will wait for other options to emerge, but QPR are the only team to have opened formal talks over a loan move until the end of the season. Adebayor was brought to White Hart Lane by current Hoops boss Harry Redknapp, who is keen to strike a deal to bring the front man in on a temporary basis. Out of favour Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor is holding out for more deadline-day options . QPR boss Harry Redknapp has said although desireable, a move for Adebayor (left) would be too expensive . Redknapp says that QPR are targeting signings before the end of the January transfer window . The Tongan striker has featured just 11 times in the Premier League this season after taking a two month break for personal reasons. The only issue concerning Redknapp during negotiations are the striker's wages, which are said to be around £100,000-per-week. But QPR owner Tony Fernandes said that the club do not anticipate any new signings coming in before the window shuts. He Tweeted: 'No more cheque book. We have good players. Bought all the players manager asked for in sunmer. Our players not mercenaries. Good guys.' However, he later added: 'If something intresting comes up we would look at it. But I'm not optimistic. Given the right motivation, tactics and coaching we can achieve much more.' The 30-year-old is out of favour at White Hart Lane following the meteoric rise in form of young Harry Kane. Kane, who confirmed a new five-and-a-half year deal on Monday morning, netted his 20th goal of the season against West Brom on Saturday. The 21-year-old will now commit his future to the  club until 2020 - on terms of £45,000 a week.

"Moscow Zoo has unveiled its newest, and surely a contender for cutest, new resident - a rare red panda named Zane. The one-year-old female made the journey to Russia from Ireland's Dublin Zoo in mid-October but she was under quarantine until this week. Zane appears comfortable in her new surroundings, albeit a bit lonely given she will live alone in the enclosure at least until next year when the zoo aims to introduce a second red panda. Zane, the one-year-old red panda from Dublin Zoo, settles into her new habitat in Moscow Zoo . The red panda, also known as a firefox or red cat-bear, grooms while sitting on a tree branch . Zoo director Anna Kachurovskaya said the visitors to zoo would 'help it to cope with the loneliness'. Red pandas, sometimes nicknamed firefoxes, lesser pandas or red cat-bears, are slightly larger than a domestic cat and live to around eight years. They hail from the temperate forest regions across Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar and Nepal, but their numbers are significantly under threat. The World Wildlife Fund estimates less than 10,000 adult red pandas are left in the wild with the species listed as 'vulnerable' in the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species, one level short of being officially endangered. With less than 10,000 of the elusive red pandas left in the wild, Zane is a rare treat for zoo visitor . Red pandas hail from the temperate forest regions across Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar and Nepal . Hunting, accidental capture (getting caught in traps meant for other animals) and a loss of habitat is compounding the red panda's already delicate existence - the animals, like their bamboo eating namesakes, are fond of food sources that are notably void of nutrition. Zoo director Anna Kachurovskaya said: 'The red panda is a foodie, so he will choose very young twigs, very young leave, very young plumules (roots). The trouble is that this part of the plant is not very nutritious. That's why she has to spend up to 13 hours in search of food and eat up to 30 per cent of their body weight.'","Zane the red panda spent six weeks in quarantine after trip from Dublin .

"These close up shots of a pair of nesting barn owls happily posing together on a wooden fence-post were captured by a quick-witted wildlife photographer. Robert Fuller, 42, started feeding the  birds, who are typically shy animals, after they nested near his home in the Yorkshire Wolds and gradually crew more accustomed to his lens. He set up a GoPro camera in front of the post and was able to lure them up-close with food - snapping the love birds in action as the male barn owl showed off his impressive wings. The two owls happily posed together on a wooden fence-post as they stared directly down the camera lens . The images were captured by wildlife photographer Robert Fuller, who noticed them nesting near his home . After a dismal breeding season for barn owls last year, when Mr Fuller spotted the birds nesting near his home in Thixendale, North Yorkshire, he left out a meal of mice and chicks every evening. Once they grew used to his presence they would follow him down the valley to the wooden post - and the male would even land on his head a few times. Mr Fuller, who had to get a special licence to take the photos, believes the trust they developed allowed him to stay close and capture these images. He also recorded footage of the pair using the powerful action camera, which was less than two feet from the feeding post. He put out meals of mice and chicks and gained the trust of the birds, who grew more accustomed to him . Setting up a Go-Pro camera on a wooden fence-post, he was able to capture a collection of close-up shots . He said: 'Last year was the worst barn owl breeding year on record in the whole of England. So at the end of the breeding season I set about feeding a particular pair near me. 'I started off feeding them mice then chicks every night and they eventually became so accustomed to me that they would follow me down the valley when they saw me coming. 'Barn owls are naturally quite wary of people so it surprised me but they became quite used to me, especially the male. The male owl, pictured tucking into one of Mr Fuller's meals, even landed on his head as they made their way to the area to have their picture taken in the Yorkshire valleys . Barn owls had a dismal breeding season last year and Mr Fuller wanted to do what he could to help them out . 'I watched them over a period of months and gradually knew what they would do and how I could best capture them in action but it does look as if they are posing for the pictures.' His efforts not only reaped the rewards for his photography, the feeding also helped ensure the birds were well enough to have two broods, eight chicks in total, that all fledged and left the nest. And now the chicks have started coming back to the feeding post too. The love birds reaped the rewards of his meals and were well enough to have two brood of eight chicks . Mr Fuller, who had been watching the birds for months, was also able to capture action footage of them .","Robert Fuller, 42, started feeding pair of birds, who nested near his home .

"And you thought romance was dead? Then think again because everybody is in love with this kid Harry Kane. It was the game of his life, like watching someone win the goal of the season, player of the year and world player of the year award all on the same night. It will have to end with an England call up. Here at White Hart Lane, when Mauricio Pochettino’s team put away their great London rivals Chelsea 5-3, Kane was magnificent. VIDEO Scroll down to see Pochettino on Kane's England chances . Harry Kane was in sensational form on New Year's Day as he scored twice in the 5-3 win over Chelsea . He scored twice, won a penalty for Andros Townsend to convert in first half injury time and set up the fifth for Nacer Chadli. At the final whistle this remarkable young man milked the moment, taking his time to leave his field of dreams and lapping up the applause from Tottenham supporters. He was entitled to do so. Kane owns the place now, the main man in this team as they continue their charge up the table. They have to fancy themselves for fourth. In a performance that most analysts would agree was borderline ‘complete’, Kane made mugs of two of the best defenders in English football. He embarrassed Gary Cahill to such an extent that the Chelsea defender booted Kane in the back in frustration when things were going against them. For good measure, Cahill then kicked his calf. Gary Cahill kicks Kane in the back as the game was slipping out of Chelsea's reach . ‘I didn’t see it, but he did complain afterwards that his back is a little bit sore,’ revealed Pochettino. What a silly boy, losing his rag with Kane because this young Spurs striker had turned him this way and that for 90, frankly, mesmerising minutes. Terry, perhaps the finest English central defender of his generation, was way off the pace here. Kane murdered the pair of them. ‘It shows how good we are, scoring five goals against one of the best defences in the world and it is all coming together,’ claimed Kane. ‘We are delighted, we want to keep this run going. I am enjoying it, especially as we get so much stick from the Chelsea supporters.’ This time we only ever heard from Tottenham, chirping up when Kane scored a magnificent equaliser from the edge of the area. What an iconic figure he has become, a talisman in this Tottenham team as they try to make a move on the top four. They are on their way there. Kane is sent tumbling by Cahill to earn Tottenham a penalty in first-half stoppage time . He scores goals in every competition: Europa League, Capital One Cup and Premier League. On Monday, he can’t wait to get his teeth stuck into Burnley. Kane has scored 17 times now and he will be under consideration for a place in the England squad when Roy Hodgson finally returns from an extra long Christmas holiday. Wherever he is in the world England’s head coach will have heard about this because this remarkable young man is one of the most talked about footballers in the Premier League at this moment. ‘We need to be careful with him, but we cannot hide him away,’ admitted Pochettino after his first ever victory against a team put out by Jose Mourinho. Nacer Chadli (right) celebrates with Kane after scoring Tottenham's fifth goal . ‘The national team is not my decision, but we try to improve him every day and if the England coach believes in him and wants to give him the opportunity it is good. ‘Harry is still young, but in the last few months he has had the chance to play more and show his qualities. We are happy with that.’ In the final moments, when Kane was motioning with his arms to tell his team-mates to calm down and see this extraordinary game out, it was like watching a future Tottenham captain. He is having that effect around the place, galvanising the Tottenham supporters as they start to make an impression in the higher reaches of the table. Credit to them because even when they went a goal down at White Hart Lane, they stayed with their team. What a difference that made. Kane and team-mate Nabil Bentaleb celebrate at the final whistle as Tottenham moved up to fifth . They believed in them, waiting patiently for Kane to take this game by the scruff of the neck. The kid isn't afraid of anyone. Tottenham fans show so much passion for him here, belting out his name at the top of their voices after his second beat Thibaut Courtois in the 52nd minute. On Monday, in an FA Cup third round tie with Burnley, the love affair continues.","Tottenham beat Chelsea 5-3 at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day .

There is also a Twitter account dubbed the Islamic State of Cat, which features masked and gun-toting jihadists holding tiny kittens. ISIS terrorists - who have previously been condemned as too extreme even by Al-Qaeda - may soon be forced to forgo Nutella, however, after the cost of hazelnuts rose by 60 per cent. Italian manufacturer Ferrero may be forced to dramatically increase the price of the spread and reduce their locations in which it is sold after bad weather devastated hazelnut crops in Turkey -which borders both Syria and Iraq. While the extent of the damage to the hazelnut flowers on Turkey’s Black Sea coast is not yet fully evident, it is feared about 300,000 tonnes of the crop could have been damaged in March’s poor weather. It comes after continued warnings about the rising cost of cocoa which has continued to soar as demand outstrips production.","Militants posed with jars of Italian sweet treat while fighting in Syria and Iraq .

"A pair of science enthusiasts are thrilled after successfully launching a homemade probe into outer space - complete with Lego versions of themselves on board. The tiny toy characters, resembling best friends Jon Chippindall and Ian Cunningham, even got to walk in space as astronaut Jon floated around the Earth’s atmosphere when his strapping became loose. After setting off from Mold, North Wales last Wednesday, the £250 device named The Manchester Meteor, journeyed to 90,000ft before plunging back down to the ground in a farmer’s field in Chesterfield, Derbys - and the whole journey was caught on camera. Scroll down for video... Jon Chippindall (right) and best friend Ian Cunningham (left) have sent Lego figures to new heights after launching a homemade probe 90,000ft into outer space . Ian, 29, said: 'Being geeks, we would love to go into space but it’s a little impractical. 'So, we thought we would use Lego men that are little versions of us - Jon’s even has glasses, and they’re dressed like astronauts. 'At one point it all went a bit crazy and Jon’s strapping came loose, meaning his Lego man did a little space-walk in front of the camera!' Made from only a high-altitude balloon, a payload and an HD camera, The Manchester Meteor enjoyed the high life for around two-and-a-half-hours. Primary teacher Jon, and Ian tracked its descent from the ground and collected it some 75 miles away from its launchpad. The intrepid pair, who met while studying aerospace engineering at Manchester University, built the probe in their spare time after retaining a keen interest in space. The tiny toy characters, attached to the probe ahead of launch, were made to resemble best friends Jon Chippindall and Ian Cunningham . The two Lego characters were launched from Mold, North Wales last Wednesday, on a £250 device named The Manchester Meteor . Ian, an entrepreneur and online technology reviewer, said: 'We wanted to come up with something which was an interesting project that might inspire others. 'It’s basically a balloon with a HD camera attached to it, which we launched to almost 100,000ft. 'We were able to video its journey from take-off to landing, so with the Lego characters on board, it was almost like we were travelling in space.

The tiny toy characters even got to walk in space as astronaut Jon floated around the earth's atmosphere when his strapping became loose . The duo, from Manchester, had to intricately plan where to launch the probe from, taking into consideration weather condition and proximity to any nearby airports. 'We had to wait for a good day, and for a time when we could devote ourselves to doing it,' said Ian. 'We got clearance from the Civil Aviation Authority, who gave us some conditions like not to let it drift, and not to get too close to any airports, for obvious reasons. 'It was very nerve-wrecking and there was a moment where I thought we had lost it, but it went better than expected.' The probe managed to reach a height of 90,000ft - more than three times the height of Mount Everest. While at this height the probe captured stunning images such as this one .

'It was real excitement and relief at the same time. When we launched it, we were a bit despondent for some time thinking it wouldn’t come back - some people release them and never hear from them again.' Jon now plans to write a guide on making and launching a space camera, which could be used in schools.

"England manager Roy Hodgson will be at Selhurst Park to run a personal check on Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane against Crystal Palace. Hodgson is pondering whether to give the 21-year-old his first call-up with England's next game a Euro 2016 qualifier on March 27 against Lithuania. It is the England manager's first game of 2015 and could also give him a chance to monitor Kyle Walker, Danny Rose, Eric Dier and Andros Townsend. Harry Kane has been in sensational form for Tottenham - most recently netting a double against Chelsea . Nacer Chadli (right) celebrates with Kane (centre) after scoring their fifth goal against Chelsea . Kane is after being named in the England squad following Hodgson's recent praise of the starlet. The Three Lions boss described Kane as having 'come on leaps and bounds' after his two goals against Chelsea during Tottenham's 5-3 win at White Hart Lane. Hodgson's selection, however, could have repercussions for Gareth Southgate, the England Under-21 manager, ahead of the European U21 Championship in June. 'Harry is one of those players – Andros Townsend being another one – who didn't exactly burst on to the scene in his club side and get straight in,' Hodgson told SiriusXM FC. 'They got loaned out first and sent out to different places to learn their trade, if you like, or at least pick up some important aspects of their trade. After a stunning first half of the season Kane is now in line to make the step up to the England senior side . England manager Roy Hodgson described Tottenham's Kane as having 'come on leaps and bounds' 'We have watched [Kane] for a while and I worked with him briefly in the Under-21s when I filled in for one game. Harry has come on in leaps and bounds and I'm not surprised because I know [former coaches] Tim Sherwood and Les Ferdinand very well. 'They have worked with him at Tottenham and they always believed in him as a goalscorer. It's tremendous to see people like him doing so well and quite strange that in the Under-21s a year or two ago we were bemoaning the fact we didn't think our forwards were up to the level of the midfielders.

"They suffered a 22-0 defeat and have conceded 120 goals in 16 games, failing to win a single point. But Amory Green Rovers, who are bottom of division seven in the Devon and Exeter Saturday league, have no problem being called the worst footballers in Britain - because they are the nicest. In fact, the Christian team claim it is their gentle approach that has led to their poor performance amid the rough and tumble of the amateur game. God on their side: Amory Green Rovers are at the bottom of division seven in the Devon and Exeter Saturday legaue - but manager Marc Hodsdon (centre) says his Christian team is probably the nicest in Britain . Manager Marc Hodsdon, a  forklift delivery driver, was fiercely competitive when he started the team ten years ago, but said he changed tack after he found God. Now he recruits players of all abilities and focuses on their sporting attitude - which has led them to avoid getting a single yellow or red card. The 33-year-old said: 'We are absolutely shocking to be fair. We could well be Britain's worst football team - but we are certainly the nicest. 'We always do the best we can and try to win, but we have lost 22-0 and 17-0 already this season. We have had some right annihilations.' Badge: The team was competitive when it began ten years ago, but changed its approach to sport . He said when he started the team in 2005: 'We got promoted a few times but then I gave it up to have children. I came back into it last season but I wanted to do it a bit differently. 'I had found faith while I had been away and for us it is not about relegations and promotions any more. 'We had to clear up the debt but managed to get a good sponsorship. But it is not just about the winning any more. We just wanted the guys out there to play football. 'Throughout the course of their life many of them have been picked on and we have a couple of boys who have Aspergers Syndrome. 'Their confidence has been affected throughout their life - but they genuinely take comfort from playing football.' Mr Hodsdon said running the team according to his Christian ethos is more important than winning - a philosophy which has not suited everyone. 'There are some myths about being a Christian team which meant I had to recruit some new players,' he said. 'Not everyone respected what we were trying to do. 'We are quite competitive in a sense but we are open to everyone whatever their footballing ability. In action: Amory Green Rovers in their green kit in action against a rival team in the Saturday league . 'The most important thing about the team is about giving people somewhere to get out and socialise.' Despite the team's appalling record this season, Mr Hodsdon said it was probably the happiest in the league. 'Last Wednesday we lost 15-1 in our local derby yet we walked off the pitch being the happier team,' he said. 'Some of the players on the other side were still arguing among themselves and just not enjoying it - that is not what football is about. 'We have had a lot of praise from the league for our sporting attitude. We have never had any sending off and we never abuse the ref. Our attitude is always spot on. Relaxed: The manager said: 'Last Wednesday we lost 15-1 in our local derby yet we walked off the pitch being the happier team. Some of the players on the other side were still arguing among themselves' 'We always shake the hands of the other team.'

"That pot plant sat innocently on your desk may be more intelligent than you might think. Scientists in Germany have discovered that one particular plant, the barberry, can choose whether to abort its seeds before they are ready to prevent parasitic infestations. This is because it has something called a ‘structural memory’ that helps it anticipate future events. If a parasite invades a barberry, the plant can abort its seeds to prevent infestation, according to new study . The team at the University of Göttingen claims that this is ‘the first ecological evidence of complex behaviour in plants’. Barberry's defence mechanism was discovered when researchers found that its relative, the Oregon grape shrub, is infested with ten times as many Rhagoletis meigenii fruit flies. To understand why this was the case, 2,000 berries from different regions of Germany were collected, studied for signs of larval infestation and fed into a simulation. Barberry's defence mechanism was discovered that its relative, the Oregon grape shrub, which infested with ten times as many Rhagoletis meigenii fruit flies (pictured) as the Barberry . Scientists discovered that, rather than have a knee jerk reaction, the barberry was able to fend of fruit flies with its ability to calculate probabilities. This parasite punctures the berries in order to lay its eggs inside them. If the larva is able to develop, it will often feed on all of the seeds in the berry. The plant seems to ‘understand’ that when it has two seeds - one infested and one intact - it's a much better idea to release both before they are ripe to save the healthy seed. Researchers found that the barberry did this three quarters of the time. Barberry's defence mechanism was discovered when researchers found that its relative, the Oregon grape shrub, is infested with ten times as many Rhagoletis meigenii fruit flies as the Barberry . When a fruit only bears one seed, and that ends up infested, the barberry only releases the mature seed five per cent of the time. ‘The seeds of the infested fruits are not always aborted, but rather it depends on how many seeds there are in the berries’, said Dr Katrin Meyer. ‘This anticipative behaviour, whereby anticipated losses and outer conditions are weighed up, very much surprised us. ‘The message of our study is therefore that plant intelligence is entering the realms of ecological possibility.’ It is claimed sagebrush plants (pictured) send chemical messages through the air . A previous study found that members of the vegetable kingdom can communicate with each other. They are 'capable of more sophisticated behaviour than we imagined,' says American bug expert Professor Richard Karban. His . work, which he admits is 'controversial', suggested that plants . converse by sending chemical messages through the air, warning of hungry . predators. When a . neighbouring plant 'hears' the message, it boosts its defences against . grasshoppers, caterpillars and other invaders, he believes. Professor . Karban, of the University of California, claimed to have proved that . conversations happen between sagebrush bushes - hardy, yellow-flowered . shrubs native to the western U.S. Using scissors, he clipped away at leaves and stems of potted shrubs, damaging them in the same way as a grasshopper would. He then planted some damaged and undamaged plants in a field and measured levels of predation on their neighbours. The . leaves of the plants with clipped neighbours suffered the least . grasshopper damage, according to the journal Ecology Letters.","Barberry has 'structural memory' that helps it anticipate future events .

"Lying among a pile of papers at the hideout in Pakistan where Osama Bin Laden was shot dead was a carefully worded 21-page letter. It warned of the rise of a new and ruthless group of Islamic extremists capable of such extreme brutality that Al Qaeda should sever all links with them. In fact, it claimed the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (or ISIS) had such complete disregard for civilian life that it could damage the reputation of Al Qaeda – if such a thing were possible for an organisation that has long traded in murderous terrorism. Scroll down for video . The document, written by one of Bin Laden’s senior officials in 2011, went on to catalogue some of its acts of barbarism – including the use of chlorine gas as a chemical weapon, bombing mosques  and a massacre in a Catholic church  in Baghdad. In essence, the letter said that ISIS was simply too extreme even for the group that killed thousands in the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001. Today, ISIS, which now styles itself as simply Islamic State (IS), has become a powerful military force that has control of an area larger than Great Britain. Living under its ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam are six million people, a population larger than that of Ireland, Denmark or Finland. Its trademark black jihadi flag has  fluttered in the background of chilling ‘promotional’ videos of executions – including crucifixions and beheadings – as the militia seizes vast areas of Iraq and Syria. In short, the ‘caliphate’ – or Islamic state – it claims to have established represents the biggest shift in the political geography of the Middle East since  the borders of modern Iraq and Syria were drawn under the Sykes-Picot  agreement drafted between Britain and France in 1916. Discovery: A letter warning of the rise of ISIS was discovered at the hideout in Pakistan where Osama Bin Laden was shot dead . To understand the threat Islamic State poses to the region, it first needs to be appreciated how it has grown into a force to rival Al Qaeda. The group was founded by 43-year-old Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, a firebrand cleric held prisoner for four years by American troops in Iraq. The leader, a Sunni Muslim who despises the Shia-run Iraqi government, now commands more than 10,000 fighters, many of them former Saddam Hussein-era soldiers or disenchanted Sunnis who lost power and influence after the fall of the dictator’s regime. More worryingly, foreign Islamic extremists, including about 500 Britons, have joined IS to fight in Syria and Iraq. The group controls valuable oil fields and, with the help of wealthy Sunni backers from the Gulf states, is estimated to have amassed a staggering £1.2billion. It has even sold 8,000-year-old antiquities it has seized. 'Too extreme': The letter found in the hideout used by Bin Laden (left) catalogued some of the acts of barbarism undertaken by the group founded by cleric Abu Bakr al Baghdadi (pictured right in a U.S. 'Wanted' poster) But its real assets lie in the fanatical loyalty of its fighters (they all swear allegiance to IS) and the state-of-the-art weaponry they now possess. Much of its armoury was seized during a lightning advance several weeks ago, when fleeing Iraqi  troops abandoned the artillery and armoured vehicles that they had been given by US forces. With captured American Humvees and the latest precision firepower,  it is more than a match for the  formidable Kurdish peshmerga – which defends the Kurds’ semi-autonomous region in the north – and its 12.7mm Soviet-era machine guns and outdated Russian  T-55 tanks. As Ali Khedery, a former American official who advised US generals in Iraq, has said: ‘They are literally outgunned by an IS that is fighting with hundreds of millions of dollars of US military equipment seized from the Iraqi Army, which  abandoned it.’ So it would be naive in the extreme to think of Islamic State as a motley crew of scrappers. A force capable of meting out so much wanton violence is invariably led by commanders who rule with an iron will. Chilling: IS's trademark black jihadi flag has  fluttered in the background of chilling 'promotional' videos as the militia seizes vast areas of Iraq and Syria . But what marks them out as being particularly savvy is the way they have used social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook to create a digital ‘public relations’ machine to promote their jihad and strike fear into the hearts of their enemies. Any fighter on the ground can film an act of brutality and upload the footage in a matter of minutes – although some videos of botched amputations or killings have led to a clampdown by IS commanders. One Spanish fighter promised  to upload a film of a man being  crucified for his friends back home, but was quickly reprimanded by  his superiors. His later contrite posting simply read, ‘Our leadership forbade anyone filming it.’ However, the videos already in  circulation have already created a climate of terror. Some opposition soldiers, particularly in Syria, are defecting to the group. After all, IS has money – some of which is said to have come through private donations from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Equally, those captured by the militia face a stark choice – defect or die. Despite being trained by American troops, the Iraqi army has proven worryingly ineffective in taking on this threat. It’s why the terrorists now control much of the north of the country. They have also seized a former chemical weapons plant and a large dam that could be blown up to flood the regions downstream. Escape: Thousands of Yezidis trapped in the Sinjar mountains as they tried to escape from Islamic State forces, are rescued by Kurdish Peshmerga forces and Peoples Protection Unit (YPG) in Mosul, Iraq . The populations of the Kurdish capital of Irbil, as well as the national capital Baghdad, are now in no doubt as to the fate that would befall them if these Sunni extremists prevail. If IS cannot be stopped, they are clinging to the hope that rescue will come in the form of Iran, which supports Iraq’s Shia-led government, or the US. However, both countries are reluctant to commit troops on the ground in the political and religious quagmire of Iraq. Abu Bakr al Baghdadi knows this only too well. It is why his IS troops have been so emboldened to sweep across much of Syria and northern Iraq in recent weeks. In the past fortnight they have fought on five fronts: against the Iraqi army, the Kurdish peshmerga, Bashar Al-Assad’s Syrian regime, the Syrian opposition and the Lebanese army. When he was released by the American military police from the Camp Bucca detention facility in Umm Qasr, where he was held as an insurgent, al Baghdadi said ominously: ‘I will see you guys in New York.’ A fanciful threat? Perhaps not, when you consider that the greatest threat Islamic State poses to the world is that this so-called caliphate becomes a training ground for international terrorism, and unleashes an army of extremists against the West to kill and maim far from the bloodsoaked deserts of Iraq.","21-page letter found at the Pakistan hideout where Bin Laden was killed .

"This horrifying video shows the moment a teenager lost a game of chicken with a 54mph lorry. Against all odds, the 14-year-old boy escaped with minor injuries after being hit by the 40-tonne truck. The incident happened in October on the A449 near Penkridge, Staffordshire, and the clip has been released to deter youngsters from playing with their lives during the half term break. Cheating death: This teenage boy lost a game of chicken with a 40-tonne truck - but somehow survived . It shows three youngsters on a grass verge next to the broad single carriageway before two boys began running across. One of the boys easily cleared the path of the truck as it came screeching to a halt, but the other realised seconds before impact that he would be hit. He appeared to change direction and try outrunning the lorry, a tactic which lasted just a fraction of a second before the HGV smashed into him - still travelling at 45mph. The boy tumbled forwards into the road, rolling over until he briefly came face to face with the driver. He then hobbled off without any sign of serious injury. The video was filmed by the truck driver's dashboard camera, which showed the exact location and the time of the crash along with the speed of the lorry. The footage appears to suggest that the HGV driver was exceeding the speed limit, which is 40mph for HGVs on single carriageway main roads. The limit was due to rise from 40mph to 50mph early this year, the government announced last summer. It is 60mph for cars. Horror: The incident, caught on the driver's dashboard camera, happened in the middle of the day in October . Frightening: The driver was travelling at 54mph on the A449 near Penkridge, Staffordshire, when it unfolded . Impact: The boy's hood flew into the air as the truck, screeching to a halt, hit him at around 45mph . Concerned that the boy would contact police, the truck driver trumped him by approaching officers and handing in the footage. Police quickly decided no crime had been committed by the driver, who was described as 'extremely shaken'. The risk of death increases hugely once cars or trucks are travelling at more than 40mph. However, the number of pedestrians killed on Britain's roads has fallen almost every year for the past decade. Some 857 pedestrians were killed on the roads in 2000, a figure which had fallen below 600 by 2007 and fell below 400 for the first time in 2013. Ranked by the total number of deaths, a car is still the most dangerous place to be on the roads. Some 785 car occupants died in crashes in 2013, compared to 109 cyclists and 331 bikers. Gone: The boy's legs were whisked out of shot as truck mowed him down . Tumble: The boy rolled over several times in the road before coming to a halt some way in front of the truck . More than half of truckers now have dashboard cameras to help them provide evidence to insurance firms and police. The footage was released by SmartWitness, which manufactured the camera which filmed the incident. Sales director Mark Berry said: 'It happened on a rural road with no witnesses. Let's imagine what might have happened if it had not been captured on the camera. 'Obviously it was a huge relief to everyone that this lad was not more badly hurt. 'His escape is frankly remarkable given the size of the truck and the speed it was travelling at the time of the collision. He only had a badly bruised ankle. 'We have released the footage this week during half-term to show the crazy risk a very small number of youths are taking by playing chicken. 'I don't think anyone viewing the footage would ever contemplate playing chicken again.' Survival: For a brief moment, the teenager came face to face with the driver, who handed footage to police . Hobbling: The boy made his escape with no more than a badly bruised ankle, but left the driver shaken . A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'We received a call at 1pm on 26 October 2014, reporting a collision involving a HGV and a pedestrian on the A449 at Dunston. 'Officers attended the scene. A 14-year-old boy was taken to Newcross Hospital with minor injuries to his hand and knee. 'The incident was looked into and no further action was taken against any parties.'","Boy, 14, ran across A-road with friend near Penkridge, Staffordshire .

"New 'Nutrition Facts' labels on packages will let families know whether their food has added sugars for the first time while reflecting more realistic portion sizes. Calorie counts will also be in larger, . bolder type under the label changes being proposed by the Food and Drug . Administration, which were announced by Michelle Obama on Tuesday. Under the changes, serving sizes would be based on what people actually eat, rather than what they should eat. A serving of ice cream, for example, would be half a pint, rather than a quarter of a pint. Both 12-ounce and 20-ounce soda bottles will now read 'one serving' rather than two-and-a-half servings because people often drink the entire bottle in one sitting. Scroll Down for Video . Proposals: The FDA released images showing how the proposed new nutrition labels will look compared to current labels (left). The new label will have a bolder calorie count and will have a line for 'added sugars' Support: Michelle Obama speaks about the proposed label changes and how they will help families make healthy choices at the White House on Thursday . Many single-serving packages - a bag of . chips, a can of soup or a frozen entree, for example - would either be . listed as a single serving or list nutrient information by serving and . by container. The Food and Drug Administration says that by law, serving sizes must be based on actual consumption, not ideal consumption. 'Our . guiding principle here is very simple, that you as a parent and a . consumer should be able to walk into your local grocery store, pick up . an item off the shelf and be able to tell whether it's good for your . family,' said Mrs Obama, who announced the plans as part of her Let's Move! initiative. The changes are still a couple of years away, though. The FDA will take comments on the . proposal for 90 days, and a final rule could take another year. Once . it's final, the agency has proposed giving industry two years to comply. The FDA projects food companies will have to pay around $2 billion as they change the labels. Changes: The labels will call 20-ounce sodas, left, one serving and a pint of ice cream, right, will be marked as 2 servings instead of 4. The changes show what people actually eat instead of what they should eat . Shake up: The changes are designed to help families make healthier choices when they look at labels in stores . The Grocery Manufacturers Association, . the industry group that represents the nation's largest food companies, . did not respond to any specific parts of the proposal but called it a . 'thoughtful review'. President Pamela Bailey also said it . was important to the food companies that the labels 'ultimately serve to . inform, and not confuse, consumers'. It was still not yet clear what the final labels would look like. The FDA offered two labels in its proposal - one that looks similar to the current version but is shorter and clearer and another that groups the nutrients into a 'quick facts' category for things like fat, carbohydrates, sugars and proteins. There also would be an 'avoid too much' category for saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, sodium and added sugars; and a 'get enough' section with vitamin D, potassium, calcium, iron and fiber. Both versions list calories above all of those nutrients in a large, bold type. Nutrition advocates have long asked for added sugars on the label because it's impossible for consumers to know how much sugar in an item is naturally occurring, like that in fruit and dairy products, and how much is added by the manufacturer. According to the Agriculture . Department's 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, added sugars . contribute an average of 16 percent of the total calories in U.S. diets. Though those naturally occurring . sugars and the added sugars act the same in the body, the USDA says the . added sugars are just empty calories while naturally occurring ones . usually come along with other nutrients. New plan: Mrs Obama stands beside a proposed version of the new labels as she speaks at the White House . Campaign: On Thursday afternoon, she dances with an eggplant from the Super Sprowtz at a La Petite Academy child care center in Bowie, Maryland as part of her Let's Move campaign . Energetic: She visited to promote healthy environments and eating habits at preschools . David Kessler, who was FDA commissioner when the first Nutrition Facts labels were unveiled in the early 1990s, said he thinks focusing on added sugars and calories will have a 'demonstrative public health benefit'. Kessler said the added sweetness, like added salt, drives overeating. And companies will adjust their recipes to get those numbers down. 'No food company wants products to look bad,' he said. While some may ignore the panels, there's evidence that more people are reading them in recent years as there has been a heightened interest in nutrition. A USDA study released earlier this year said 42 per cent of working adults used the panel always or most of the time in 2009 and 2010, up from 34 per cent two years earlier. Older adults were more likely to use it.","Proposed nutritional labels will display calories in bold print .
New 'added sugars' section will show what the manufacturer has added compared to naturally occurring sugars in the product .
Serving sizes will reflect what people eat rather than what they should eat .
The labels, announced by Michelle Obama, will take at least 2 years to appear to give manufacturers enough time to make changes ."
"Nigel Pearson wants to solve Leicester goalscoring problems by signing Jermain Defoe from MLS side Toronto. The former England striker, who has been at St George’s Park recovering from a groin injury over the past few weeks, wants to return to the Barclays Premier League. His former manager Harry Redknapp also wants him at QPR and Hull chief Steve Bruce has also confirmed that he has an interest in the Toronto forward. VIDEO Scroll down to see Toronto FC's promotional viral announcing Defoe's arrival . Leicester manager Nigel Person wants Jermain Defoe to help solve his side's goalscoring problems . Defoe (left) joined MLS side Toronto in the summer 2014 but has been linked with a move back to England . Defoe, 32, left Tottenham for MLS last year, but the move has not been successful. Leicester have offered the striker, who began his career with Charlton, a lifeline and may be the only team willing to fund the deal. Toronto spent £6m on Defoe and increased his £70,000 a week wages when they signed him from White Hart Lane. They want to recoup a substantial part of that to release him and few Premier League teams are willing to match the huge salary for a player of his age. Defoe is a noted goalscorer and Leicester are desperate to find a solution to their issues up front after slipping to the foot of the table. Pearson’s side have won only three games all season since they were promoted to the Premier League and are fighting for survival under their manager. Pearson is hoping that Defoe's prolific record could help Leciester climb out the relegation zone . Both Hull manager Steve Bruce (left) and QPR's Harry Redknapp have shown an interest in signing the striker . He wants Defoe to join Leicester, who beat Hull and drew with Liverpool over the festive period, to increase their chances of survival. Redknapp is also in the market for a striker and has made it clear on a number of occasions that he wants to work with Defoe again. But the figures to bring him back to London appear to be prohibitive and Redknapp may have to look elsewhere if they cannot match Leicester’s bid. Defoe, who is closing in on fitness, wants his future resolved before the end of January and is determined to return to the Premier League.","Leicester boss Nigel Peason wants to sign Jermain Defoe from Toronto .

"Of all the reasons to lose weight, fear of not surviving a zombie apocalypse because you are too fat has got to be one of the most unusual. But that is exactly what inspired an obese mother-of-one to drop nearly 7st and become fighting fit. Siobhan Maccow, 27, went on her brutal 'zombie apocalypse diet' as a tribute to her favourite character from television show The Walking Dead. Siobhan went from 17st 7lb (left) to 11st (right) on her extreme 'zombie apocalypse' routine . Siobhan was inspired to change her body by the character Michonne (pictured), played by Zimbabwean-American actress Danai Gurira in the hit AMC series The Walking Dead . Ms Maccow, who has a six-year-old daughter, Milly, was 17st 7lb and wore size 18 clothing when she decided she wanted to emulate Michonne, played by Zimbabwean-American actress Danai Gurira in the hit AMC series. She began an intense exercise regime and overhauled her diet to slim down to the 11st size 12 she is today. Ms Maccow, a care worker, said: 'Michonne inspired me. I decided that I was going to get fit enough to survive the zombie apocalypse. 'Danai Gurira plays the character brilliantly - she has such a good body, and is so strong. I wanted to be just like her. 'Whenever I'm in the gym and I work really hard at my cardio exercises. I imagine being Michonne, and that getting fit is really important for surviving zombie attacks. It keeps me motivated. Began an intense exercise regime inspired by the TV character and thoughts of surviving zombie attacks . Thoughts of surviving a zombie apocalypses helped keep her motivated through her training and diet . 'I put Nicki Minaj on and pretend that I'm running through a zombie wasteland.' Ms Maccow, of Slough, first started to pile on the pounds when her daughter started school. She began to binge-eat as a means of coping with her boredom while unemployed. By the time she reached adulthood, Ms Maccow was subject to unkind comments about her weight, sometimes even from her own daughter. Ms Maccow said: 'I remember when Milly and I were in the changing rooms at Primark - I was trying on a new dress when I was at my fattest and my daughter said to me 'Mum, that dress is too skinny for you.' 'The whole changing room laughed at me. I was so embarrassed, that I knew I had to change.' The mother-of-one dropped from a size 18 to a slim and toned size 12 . Siobhan says her new fight fit  physique means she is confident of surviving a zombie attack . Before losing weight Miss Maccow did not eat breakfast but ate a full English fry-up for lunch. She typically two Fray Bentos pies for her evening meal and snacked on portions of takeaway fried chicken and oven chips during the day. From July 2012, when she began her fitness regime, she began eating Weetabix for breakfast, tuna pasta salad for lunch, and homemade soup for dinner. When she snacked, she ate cashew nuts or dried cranberries. She also began running at the gym for at least 25 minutes every day and began weight training to tone her muscles. Today, having slimmed down three dress sizes, she wears size 12 clothing and weighs 17st 7lb, a total weight loss of 6st 7lb. She said: 'Getting into fitness has influenced my daughter, who is now keen to live healthily, and inspired my mum to lose some weight too.'

"A British athlete has issued a distraught plea to find her Commonwealth Games gold medal after it was stolen from her home while she was upstairs. Kelly Sotherton won the heptathlon gold in Melbourne in 2006 and it remained one of her most treasured honours after she retired from the sport in 2012. Last night it was taken from the 38-year-old's home in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, along with a laptop computer and cash. Distraught: Kelly Sotherton had her heptathlon gold medal from the 2006 Commonwealth Games stolen  while she was upstairs. Pictured, the former athlete receiving the medal (left) and realising she had won (right) Appeal: Ms Sotherton issued this distraught appeal on Twitter, which was picked up by hundreds of users . Police said the homeowner was upstairs at the time and only reported the theft at 8.50am. The burglary has now prompted Ms Sotherton and her partner, triple jump gold medal winner Nathan Douglas, to make an appeal for the stolen medal on Twitter. 'Been burgled,' Ms Sotherton wrote. 'One thing stolen was my Commonwealth gold medal from Melbourne 2006. PLEASE RT HELP ME FIND IT. 'If you are offered this medal or any other medals (national golds/silvers/bronzes) please contact Crimestoppers'. She was inundated with responses today, including by the crime prevention charity. The organisation advertised her appeal and told her: 'We're sorry to hear about your medal being stolen. Remember anyone with info can contact us anonymously on 0800 555 111.' Ms Sotherton tweeted her thanks for her fans' help after the appeal was repeated by Crimestoppers . The track and field star later gave a message to her well-wishers, writing: 'I wish I could reply to all of you.... So I'll send this to all of you tweeters for your help. Fingers crossed x'. A West Midlands Police spokesman said: 'We were called at 8.50am today to reports of a burglary in Sutton Coldfield overnight. A gold medal, laptop and cash were stolen from the address. 'Enquiries are ongoing, however there have been no arrests at this stage. Anyone with information should call Birmingham North police on 101. 'The occupiers of the house were upstairs at the time.' Born on the Isle of Wight, the athlete moved to the West Midlands in 1998. Ms Sotherton collected a host of prizes in her athletics career, but the gold Commonwealth medal was one her biggest triumphs. Ceremony: The former heptathlete's win in Melbourne in 2006 (pictured) was a crowning moment in her career . Torched: The raid came ten months after cars belonging to the athlete and her partner, triple jump gold medal winner Nathan Douglas, were torched outside her home in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands . She also won bronze at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and was fourth in Beijing in 2008. However, she announced her retirement from the sport after failing to recover from back surgery in time for the London Olympics. The theft comes ten months after cars belonging to Sotherton and her partner were gutted by fire outside her home. The couple revealed their £15,000 Honda Civic was the first car to go up in flames at 3.30am, and the fire spread to a £20,000 Audi A3 which was parked next to it. It was suspected the blaze could have been caused by arson or a technical fault. However, a police spokesman said today that arson had later been ruled out.","Burglary happened last night while 38-year-old heptathlete was upstairs .

"QPR were so desperate to land Emmanuel Adebayor on loan on Monday that they offered to pay a staggering £75,000 a week of the forward’s salary. Rangers made Adebayor their principle transfer deadline day target and were prepared to fork out most of his salary to sign him for the rest of the season. Adebayor made it clear at Tottenham’s training ground on Monday morning that he had no intention of swapping life at White Hart Lane for a relegation battle. Emmanuel Adebayor will remain a Tottenham player for the rest of the season after failing to secure a move . West Ham were keen on Adeabyor, but wouldn't match Spurs chairman Daniel Levy's salary demands . Adebayor is paid £100,000 a week at Tottenham and chairman Daniel Levy was happy to do a deal with QPR on the terms offered to them on Monday morning. When Adebayor refused to travel to Rangers, Levy refused to let him leave for West Ham when they offered to pay only 50 per cent of his salary. Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino was among a number of staff desperate to see the back of him because he fears that he could disrupt the rhythm of the squad in the build up to the Capital One Cup final. Spurs officials tried desperately to convince Levy to accept the Hammers’ proposal, but the chairman’s head had been turned by QPR’s outrageous offer earlier in the day. Adebayor (left) had no intention of swapping life at White Hart Lane for a relegation battle with QPR . The Hammers made their first enquiry for Adebayor at around 3pm on Monday and Pochettino was convinced that the forward would be moving to Upton Park for the rest of the season. Levy, who has a difficult relationship with Hammers’ co-chairman David Sullivan and the chief executive Karren Brady, refused to do a deal at £50,000 a week, which is half of his salary. The Spurs chairman, who has a reputation for being a ruthless negotiator, wanted the Hammers to up their bid for the former Manchester City, Real Madrid and Arsenal striker. Instead he has been left with a disillusioned player and Pochettino is already trying to work out how to integrate the forward into his squad after a deadline day disaster. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino now has to try and integrate Adebayor back into the squad .","Emmanuel Adebayor earns £100,000 a week at Tottenham .

"For more than 100 years, a humble brick bridge stood in this quiet Costwolds village. Now that peace is shattered - after the railway crossing was replaced with a lurid green 'tin can'. Villagers are furious with Network Rail, which tore down the structure over the Great Western main line and built one four inches higher to leave room for overhead electric wires. Before: This humble brick bridge stood over the Great Western main line in Wiltshire for more than a century . After: Network Rail had to raise the bridge by four inches - so replaced it with this bolt-ridden lurid 'tin can' A main road out of Brinkworth, Wiltshire, which has 1,300 residents and claims to be Britain's longest village, was closed for three and a half months while the bridge was installed. It finally re-opened just before Christmas, but residents were none the wiser about the design because work continued under weatherproof covers. By the time the green, bolt-ridden metal facade was unveiled, it was too late. 'It's an eyesore. It's a hideous thing,' said villager Jim Humm, 74. 'It's a real monstrosity. 'It is not at all what we expected. The work started in December and they've been doing it for a couple of months now. 'They've had it covered up the whole time they were doing the work so nobody knew it was coming. 'They just took down the covers and there it was, we couldn't even do anything about it because it was already done. Horror: Residents said they were unaware of the 'monstrosity' taking shape because it was built under covers . One resident said: 'The look just doesn't fit, it just does not fit comfortable in this rural area' 'It was such a shock when it was revealed, it's like a giant tin can. It really ruins the look of our nice little village.' Another local, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'Basically it's an absolute eyesore and a travesty that it's been built to this kind of design. 'This is a small rural rural village. Ok, you can imagine and understand that things have to change and progress but what they've actually put up is a joke. 'I mean it looks like a rotten tin can. The look just doesn't fit, it just does not fit comfortable in this rural area.' The old bridge was built over the new Wootton Bassett to Bristol spur of the Great Western main line which opened to trains in 1903, two years after the death of Queen Victoria. Fuming: Jim Humm, 74, is one of the 1,300 residents in Brinkworth, the longest village in Britain at six miles . Mr Humm said: 'It's an eyesore. It's a hideous thing. It's a real monstrosity. It is not at all what we expected' It was a feat of engineering in its day, slashing the travel time from London to south Wales, but is now undergoing the most dramatic upgrade in its history. Diesel trains still run on the line so rail bosses are electrifying the entire route - but the £500million cost is spiralling according to Labour, who claimed in October it had reached £1.6billion. For efficiency reasons, and because an EU directive says new lines must be able to take European trains, Network Rail is installing overhead electric wires instead of an electrified 'third rail'. That means several bridges over the ageing line are too low and have to be replaced. A Network Rail spokesman said officials do not know how much the bridge cost because contractors were paid for a series of bridges in one deal. Eyesore: The bridge is part of a multi-million pound scheme to electrify the line between London and Bristol . Brave new world: Network Rail apologised for the look of the bridge but said it had to save taxpayers' money . But she added: 'We are sorry to hear that some residents do not find the bridge at School Hill aesthetically pleasing. 'This bridge required essential work to prepare it for electrification and the arrival of a new fleet of faster, longer, quieter and greener electric trains. 'As a public funded organisation, we must balance our duty to preserve the heritage of the railway with the best use of taxpayers' money. 'Now this bridge is reopen, people and businesses in the area are a step closer to seeing the benefits that electrification and the new electric trains will bring.'","Brick bridge stood over Great Western main line for more than 100 years .

"Sea ice cover in the Antarctic is now at its highest level since records began. Satellite images show 7.7 million square miles (20 million sq km) of ice surrounding the continent. But rather than disproving global warming, scientists claim that this growth may in fact be caused by it. Satellite images taken recently show 7.7 million square miles (20 million square kilometres) of sea around the continent.Rather than disproving global warming, scientists claim that the growth in sea ice is caused by it . The ice has broken records on about 150 days this year, showing that it is gaining much greater coverage than in previous years. The area of sea ice seen from space is roughly double the size of the Antarctic continent and about three times the size of Australia. Dr Guy Williams, a sea ice specialist at University of Tasmania told The Conversation that the new records add to an 'exciting' puzzle for climate scientists. Each record-breaking year is different due to variations in seasonal weather— 'it's those differences that will tell us something,' he said. Trends in sea ice duration, 1979-2010, showing large regional variations. Rather than disproving global warming, some scientists claim that the growth in sea ice may in fact be caused by it . Westerly winds, which flow around Antarctica, are speeding up and moving south. This is thought to be linked to an increase in greenhouse gases and an increase in sea ice . The growth of sea ice isn't even, however. The region west of the Antarctic Peninsula, for instance, shows a large decline in sea ice. Conversely, in areas such as the Ross Sea, sea ice is increasing. According to James Whitmore at The Conversation, there are two main theories to explain the changes in Antarctic sea ice. The first is that westerly winds, which flow around Antarctica, are speeding up and moving south. This is thought to be linked to an increase in greenhouse gases and an increase in sea ice. The second theory is that sea ice forms easier due to the colder and fresher melt water from Antarctica's melting glaciers and ice sheets. Despite sea ice increasing glaciers in the northern Antarctic Peninsula are melting faster than ever before, warns new research. And small glaciers in that area could disappear within 200 years, according to the study. Researchers warned that increased snowfall will not prevent the continued melting, and the 'unprecedented' glacier recession will result in 'significant' contributions to sea level rises. An international team of researchers, led by Dr Bethan Davies, from Royal Holloway, University of London, has discovered that small glaciers that end on land around the Antarctic Peninsula are highly vulnerable to slight changes in air temperature and may be at risk of disappearing within 200 years. The scientists said that temperatures are currently rising rapidly in the Antarctic Peninsula, and because warmer air holds more moisture, the amount of snowfall has also increased. Some researchers have suggested that this may offset the melting of the glaciers, however this study found that just a small rise in air temperature increased melting so much that even large amounts of extra snowfall could not prevent glacier recession. Another theory for increasing sea ice in the South Pole is that sea ice forms easier due to the colder and fresher melt water from Antarctica's melting glaciers and ice sheets . 'This is an area covered by sea ice which we've never seen from space before,' Jan Lieser from the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre told ABC News. 'Thirty-five years ago the first satellites went up which were reliably telling us what area, two dimensional area, of sea ice was covered and we've never seen that before, that much area.' However, as the area covered in sea ice around Antarctica expands, scientists claim the ice on the continent is continuing to melt. Researchers are now using autonomous underwater robots to measure the thickness of Antarctic sea ice with much greater accuracy over bigger areas.","Images suggest there is 7.7 million square miles of sea around continent .

"More than 20 ponies have starved to death on Bodmin Moor, with at least two of the animals dying while giving birth because they were too weak from neglect. Eight of the ponies had to be shot by Government vets because they were too weak and emaciated to come down from the moor, according to a farmers and landlords group. One pregnant mare was due to be put down but foaled overnight. Mother and baby have now been taken in by South West Equine Protection along with two other ponies. Ponies apparently dumped on Bodmin Moor have starved to death due to neglect . It is not known who owned the animals and it appears they had been dumped on the moor and unable to withstand the conditions on the higher ground. Bodmin ponies are owned by farmers who have grazing rights on the land but they are bound by law to care for them and feed them during the winter. Julie Dowton, secretary of the commoners' association, said: 'It is an appalling situation. We are absolutely distressed. 'The whole Bodmin Moor farming community is absolutely appalled that it has happened and we now have to look at how we are going to clear it up.' The long winter has meant farmers have had to spend more on feeding their animals, she said, but added that there was 'no excuse' for letting them starve. Ponies native to Bodmin Moor are owned by farmers who have grazing rights but are bound by law to feed them during the winter (file photo) At least two of the ponies died while giving birth because they did not have the strength to survive . 'We have some wonderful farmers who really look after their animals but unfortunately in this part of the moor something has gone wrong,' she said. 'We cannot identify the owners, the ponies have no markings on them. 'There is no doubt that some of them are not Bodmin Moor ponies. Why they are here we do not know.' Twelve corpses were removed from the moor today while more corpses are to be brought down over the coming days . It is not known who owned the ponies and it appears they were dumped by owners who wanted rid . This morning, 12 corpses were brought down from the moor, with more to be taken away in the next few days. A further 30 ponies, said to be 'borderline', are to be inspected on the moor during the course of the week by Government vets with the hope that they can be nursed back to full health.","Two mares died while giving birth because they were not strong enough .

"A mourner got so drunk after a friend's funeral he woke up hundreds of miles away in Amsterdam and 'had no idea' how he got there. Inebriated Sainsbury's worker James O'Kane, from Orpington, south-east London, booked a 4am taxi to Gatwick Airport and bought a £232 ticket to the Dutch capital after a wake the night before. The 22-year-old first realised he was not at home when he was woken up on a British Airways flight as it landed at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. 'I cannot believe what happened. I remember waking up on the flight when the stewardess announced we had landed in Amsterdam. I had no idea how I got there,' he told MailOnline. 322 miles from home: The moment James O'Kane arrived in Amsterdam - before it dawned on him he had no clothes, no money and nowhere to stay . Making the best of it: The 22-year-old Sainsbury's worker outside the central station and sex museum in Amsterdam, where he wandered around for three days in his funeral suit and flip flops . Winter break: The 22-year-old said he had no idea how he managed to get to the city, only that he must have bought his ticket online . 'I took a picture at the airport, I think I was still a bit drunk, and I was pleased to be there. But then I realised I had no money, nowhere to stay, no luggage, no underwear, not even tooothpaste. I had also left my glasses at home so was struggling to see. 'I also had never been abroad on my own before. 'For the next three days I wandered around in my three-piece suit and had to buy some flip-flops because shoes were hurting. I couldn't afford trainers. 'The worst thing was that Amsterdam was below freezing. 'I have never done anything like this before, it's completely out of character'. Dazed and confused: James O'Kane got drunk after a funeral and woke up in Amsterdam the next morning after booking a taxi and taking a BA flight . Holiday snaps: James entertained friends back home on Facebook by posting selfies, including one with the Grim Reaper in the city's main square and another outside a famous coffee shop . James said after the funeral of his friend Paula, 20, there was a wake and he later attended a birthday party in Croydon after what had been a 'sad day'. When in Holland the Sainsbury's worker admitted he panicked because he had never been abroad on his own before. He had used the passport he had taken to the pub as ID to leave Britain. After a conversation with airline staff in Amsterdam he learned his return flight home was in three days, but he had no accommodation booked in the city and only £50 in his pocket. But any hopes that he would be rescued . by his mother Janice, 58, evaporated because she agreed to pay for a . hotel room but no earlier flight because he 'had made his bed and had to . lie in it'. On Facebook he checked in at his Amsterdam hotel and told friends: 'Having . a fantastic time on my own abroad wearing the same clothes, and the . same breath as a deceased homeless person not to forget waking up 322 . miles away from where I originally began'. Home: Supermarket worker James thought he was in bed in Orpington, Kent, pictured, but was actually at Schiphol Airport in the Dutch capital . Dream destination: Amsterdam is one of the world's most vibrant cities, but Mr O'Kane struggled because he had booked three days there but had no money . His father Nick, 57, said today: 'It is unbelievable. He rang his mum and said ""I cannot believe it mum, I'm in Amsterdam"". 'We were tearing our hair out - completely gobsmacked'. So for three days James wandered Amsterdam's streets in his funeral suit and flip flops bought because his formal shoes rubbed his feet. A lack of money to enjoy the historic city of Amsterdam was made worse because he had left his glasses in Orpington. But he did take a series of selfies to remember his holiday. He said: 'It's funny now, but I wasn't laughing then. I'm not planning any more adventures.'

"This past weekend at the NPC Junior USA Bodybuilding Championship, only one bodybuilder among hundreds of the men and women competing got a standing ovation. Though she didn't win any major awards, armless bodybuilder Barbie Thomas had the Charleston, South Carolina crowd cheering and on their feet. The 37-year-old mother-of-two lost both her arms during a horrific electrical accident as a toddler - but that hasn't stopped her from pursuing her bodybuilding dream. Scroll down for video . Standing ovation: At the NPC Junior USA Bodybuilding Championship this weekend, armless bodybuilder Barbie Thomas had the Charleston, South Carolina crowd cheering and on their feet . Highlight: Thomas, 39, didn't win any major awards, but was undoubtedly the star of the show for attendees . She said: 'I'd say to anyone, you can do whatever you put your mind to. 'The only limitations are the ones you put on yourself. Everyone has limitations and handicaps in some way or another - mine are more visible than yours maybe.' Competition organizer, Tres Bennett, was first introduced to Thomas when she requested that her trainer be allowed to come backstage - a request he normally rejects. But was astonished when she said: 'I need him to help me put on my costume. It's because I have no arms.' They have been firm friends ever since. No limitations: Thomas, pictured on stage this weekend, believes you can do whatever you put your mind to . Experienced: Thomas entered her first competition in 2003 and has been hooked ever since . Standing strong: Thomas (far right) can hold her own against the competition, despite having no arms . Thomas says she can do anything an average person can do - except she uses her feet. That includes brushing her teeth, making dinner, taking milk out of the fridge, texting, shopping, putting on makeup and even driving. 'Everyone has limitations and handicaps in some way or another - mine are more visible than yours maybe' The single mom - who has been married three times - began bodybuilding back in 2003. She said: 'I used to read about all the fitness competitors in magazines - and I thought that was the coolest thing ever. I wanted to be like them and do the things they were doing. I thought it was amazing.' Thomas decided to take the plunge into the sport after years of doubting herself and wondering if she'd even qualify because she didn't have arms to do the competition mandatories: 'I finally called the locale chairperson and talked to him about it; and he gave me the green light. Feelgood factor: Thomas is a single mother-of-two and has been married three times. She says bodybuilding gives her a goal to work towards and makes her feel good about herself . Tough training: Thomas's workouts vary each day from cardio and abs to stretching and track work . Managing motherhood: Thomas admits there are certain challenges when it comes to raising her two sons, but says she just uses her feet where others might use their hands . 'So in 2003 I entered my first fitness competition and loved it. Now it's in my blood and I can't live without it.' Thomas lost her arms when she was two . years old. She climbed onto an electrical transformer and grabbed the . wires. The electricity entered her hands and surged through her body - . scorching her arms down to the bone and turning them into something . 'like charcoal.' Rare skill: Thomas demonstrates how she uses her feet to text on her phone . 'The doctor said I wouldn't live - and if I did live, I'd probably be a vegetable,' she said. 'But God had a different plan for me; I'm still here, healthy, and alive and well.' Not only is Thomas alive and well but she continues to push her body to the limits by dancing, swimming and playing soccer. 'My first few fitness competitions I did get some funny looks,' she admitted. 'I'm sure people were wondering what I thought I was doing up there. Obviously it's a physique competition and I'm missing part of my physique and I don't have the symmetry of what they are looking for. 'But after . I did my routine for the first time, people realized that I was an . athlete just like the rest of them - and I did belong up there.' 'I don't know why they go as crazy as they do for me; maybe its something different.' So far, Thomas' greatest bodybuilding victory came in March 2012, when she came in fifth out of six competitors. She . added: 'It was actually the first time I placed ahead of people - and . that was a big milestone for me. Even though I still was fifth place, I . was happy I placed ahead of someone - someone who actually has two arms . and their whole body.' Bodybuilding gives Thomas a goal to work . towards and makes her feel good about herself. Her workouts vary each . day from cardio and abs to stretching and track work. Anything is possible: Thomas believes that the mind is a really very powerful thing - and so is attitude . When not competing, Thomas loves doing the things a normal mom would do and enjoys looking after her two sons. She added: 'Yes there are the challenges and trials that come with bringing up kids. I don't think mine were any different - I just had to use my feet. But I got through it and my kids got through it.' 'Sometimes I have to sit on the floor or sometimes I have to sit on the counter - but its still the same stuff you do. The mind is a really very powerful thing and so is attitude - and if you keep a really positive attitude and believe in yourself and believe that you can - then anything is possible.'","Barbie Thomas lost her arms in an electrical accident when she was just two.

"A police officer who allegedly sent more than 800 tweets criticising his force and calling bosses 'lower than slime' has been sacked. Tony Ryan, 33, was found to have sent tweets from @TheBritishCop - including posts labelling his officials 'scum' - despite denying that the Twitter site was his. However, his seniors matched his tweets with his duties and ruled it must have been his. PC Tony Ryan who has been sacked for allegedly running a Twitter page criticising Avon and Somerset police . PC Ryan, who was based in Filton and had 10 years service, was dismissed for gross misconduct after a Professional Standards Department (PSD) investigation carried out by Avon and Somerset Police. It is believed to be the first time the force has sacked someone because of their Twitter use' He was dismissed for gross misconduct after a disciplinary panel decided on the 'balance of probability' he was the anonymous officer. Ryan was found to have called professional standards officers 'lower than slime' and 'scum' and said bosses treated 'hard-working staff like garbage'. The tweets, posted between March and October last year, criticised officers in Bristol and described management and resources as 'so bad'. Investigators could not directly attribute the posts to him but decided they matched his 'intimate knowledge'. But Mr Ryan, who has been with Avon and Somerset force for ten years, is adamant he has nothing to do with the account and has been 'hung out to dry' by an online impostor. He said: 'My reaction is simply disbelief. I am, and always have been, 100 per cent innocent of this garbage and tried to conduct myself with dignity through the whole process. '@TheBritishCop on Twitter has allowed them to hang me out to dry. Whoever they are can do what they like and get away with it, because I am their scapegoat.' He was first accused of being behind the messages in October when officers from the professional standards department (PSD) presented him with print outs of the tweets. He said he offered up his mobile phone, computers and email account to investigators to prove he was innocent - but the standards board did not take him up on the offer.

The tweets, posted between March and October last year, criticised officers in Bristol and described management and resources as 'so bad' Instead an investigation was carried out by the force who decided the tweets matched the police officer's personal and professional experiences. They said he was responsible for 'persistent undermining through social media of the leadership and function of Avon and Somerset Constabulary, so as to undermine confidence in the police'. The panel concluded: 'We considered there to be sufficient strong indicators of the identity of @TheBritishCop to be PC Tony Ryan, supported by the weight of more general indicators of the identity as an officer with intimate knowledge of Avon and Somerset.' The decision came despite a tweet from @TheBritishCop to deny they are even employed by Avon and Somerset Constabulary. They tweeted: 'I know many Avon and Somerset and Devon and Cornwall officers, as well as a couple of Gloucestershire police officers. It is not the first time Twitter has been used to apparently bemoan the bureaucracy of the police force.

Last year, Inspector Gadget, whose blog recorded more than 12 million hits, unexpectedly tweeted that he was 'going state 11' – off duty – and deleted postings dating back to 2006. Another blogger,  NightJack, wrote an anonymous chronicle about his life as a Lancashire police officer. But his identity was disclosed against his wishes by a national newspaper and he was reprimanded by his force. And a conman who tweeted as a Metropolitan Police officer supposedly  tackling London riots was jailed for five years. Ellis Ward, 29, of Bishops's Cleeve, near Cheltenham, had also conned three women out of a total of £42,000 and posed as an army major injured in Iraq. His 'riots' tweets - in which he claimed he was helping combat riots in Tottenham and Croydon -  were followed by 3,000 people including newspapers. 'What they've done to the officer in A&S is a disgrace. They will no doubt do the same to me if I go public.' Chief Inspector Kevan Rowlands, the deputy head of PSD, said: 'Our attention was drawn to inappropriate and offensive comments being made on social media between March and October last year, which were suspected to have been posted by a serving police officer. 'Following an internal investigation, a misconduct hearing was held. As a result, the officer was dismissed.' He said tweeting officers have to adhere to a code of ethics and added: 'We will not tolerate any offensive or inappropriate comments being made on social media by our staff - whether at work or outside. This will result in us looking into the matter and may result in criminal action or possible misconduct enquiries.'

"There are times when you watch Eden Hazard and wonder how the Chelsea winger is supposed to cope with all this attention. He does not seek fame, is rarely pictured outside of a football stadium and behaves impeccably when he is wearing Chelsea colours. Instead Hazard pays a heavy price for those dancing feet because whenever he steps on to a football pitch he is kicked all over it. Eden Hazard was fouled a remarkable nine times during Chelsea's clash with PSG . Marco Verratti goes in with studs showing during PSG's Champions League clash with Chelsea . How was Veratti not sent off for this? The Italian midfielder went in with two feet against  Hazard . Here in Parc des Princes, in this Champions League clash against Paris Saint-Germain, he was fouled more times than any other player so far this season in the competition. Nine free-kicks borders on vendetta status and it is not a record Laurent Blanc’s side should be proud of after this filthy first leg. This is the list of PSG players who nailed Hazard in Paris and it does not make for good reading. This is grim: Marco Verratti (3), Gregory van der Wiel (2), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (1), Blaise Matuidi (1), David Luiz (1), Maxwell (1). Hang your heads in shame, guys, because this is not the way god meant this great game to be played. They took it in turns here to put the reducer on Chelsea’s left winger, queuing up whenever - and sadly, wherever - he was in possession. This nothing to be proud of at PSG. To think that the Parisians once coveted Hazard, before he signed his new super-contract last week, this had the stench of retribution for ignoring their passionate advances. He was kicked all over the place. Again. Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic heads in the opening goal of the game late in the first half .

Verratti was easily the worst culprit, slicing through him on a night when Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir should have shown far more than two yellow cards to PSG’s players. The PSG midfielder covered more ground - most of it spent chasing Hazard around the field - than any other player on the pitch in this first leg. This guy needs to have a look at his game. Mourinho made a bee-line for him afterwards, pointing out the hatchet man in this PSG team after a series of assaults on the Chelsea forward. ‘In England you like to bring up some other discussions, but this point is important because of what happened today,’ declared Mourinho. ‘For example, what happened with Verratti. If it is another player, they will stay on the floor, they will roll on the grass and scream - these kids will ask for cards. ‘This kid Hazard is pure. When he goes to the floor it is for a reason and there were nine fouls on him. In the Premier League it is exactly the same, but it is only now that you ask this question.’ Quite how the Chelsea forward keeps his composure, keeping his mouth shut when the temptation was to complain to the referee is a skill in itself. Is this how we want the modern game to be played, to watch the artists taken out by the cloggers waiting their turn to mug him in midfield? Is he supposed to put up with this because he is paid £200,000-a-week, that somehow the cash is a cushion for some of the crash landings? Veratti fouled Hazard three times on Tuesday night, more than any other player . Zlatan Ibrahimovic races away from Brazilian midfielder Ramires during the first half on Tuesday night . If there is an argument that he goes down too softly it is because every time he dips his shoulder, there was a threat that some bully in a PSG shirt would try to take him out. There is no finer sight in football than watching Hazard on the ball as he glides across some of the best defences in the game before picking out a killer pass. Despite the thunderous challenges, his appetite is undiminished. ‘It happens game after game,’ added Mourinho. ‘Give cards to the opponents, follow the rules of the game and it is was simple as that.’ These latest attacks are no accident, they are not a freak of football because the trend and temptation to rough him up in the Barclays Premier League is also too much for some. This season, according to the analysts Opta, the Belgian winger has been fouled a staggering 74 times, more than any other player in the country. Mourinho called it right here, demanding protection for Hazard after another night when he was an obvious target for another savaging. He survived, emerging unscathed as this first leg threatened to boil over following Edison Cavan’s clever second half equaliser. Back at Stamford Bridge this weekend, when Chelsea take on Burnley, Mourinho will get another chance to cry foul. Hazard shouts out in pain after being fouled at the Parc des Princes .

"Malala Yousafzai is donating $50,000 she was awarded after winning the World Children's Prize to rebuild U.N. schools in Gaza . Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl shot in the head by the Taliban for championing girls' right to education, is donating $50,000 to help rebuild schools in Gaza. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala, 17, is using cash she was given for winning the World Children's Prize to rebuild U.N. schools destroyed by fighting between Israel and Palestine. Malala, who was shot in the head by Taliban gunmen on a school bus two years ago, praised the U.N. agency for 'performing heroic work to serve children in Gaza, in very difficult circumstances.' She added: 'The needs are overwhelming – more than half of Gaza’s population is under 18 years of age. They want and deserve quality education, hope and real opportunities to build a future. 'This funding will help rebuild the 83 schools damaged during the recent conflict. Innocent Palestinian children have suffered terribly and for too long. 'We must all work to ensure Palestinian boys and girls, and all children everywhere, receive a quality education in a safe environment. 'Because without education, there will never be peace. Let us stand together for peace and education because together we are more powerful.' Dozens of Gaza's schools were damaged or destroyed during the 50-day war, in which Israel accused Hamas of hiding weapons near the buildings to maximise civilian casualties for political ends. UNRWA commissioner-general Pierre Krähenbühl said: 'We share with you the profound belief in the importance of education as a means to lift young girls and boys out of isolation and oppression. The money will help to rebuild 83 schools damaged in this summer's fighting between Israel and Palestine, in which Hamas was accused of hiding rockets near classrooms (stock image) 'You have become a symbol of the boundless potential that lies within each and every child on earth. 'You are an aspirational figure to the next generation in Palestine and beyond. You are an inspiration to all of us. Thank you.' UNRWA was established in 1949, and its mission is to assist 5million Palestine refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank and the Gaza Strip.","Malala Yousafzai, 17, was handed $50,000 as part of World Children's Prize .

"Unelected Euro judges are making a relentless attack on British laws laid down over centuries by Parliament, a devastating report warns today. A group of Tory MPs are demanding action by the Prime Minister over figures which show the UK loses three out of every four cases taken to the unaccountable European Court of Human Rights. The explosive research will reignite the row over Europe’s demand for rapists and killers to be given the vote in prison, and intensify calls for Britain to withdraw from the court’s jurisdiction. Relentless attack: Unelected judges at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, pictured, are undermining British justice by ruling in favour of murderers, terrorists and sex offenders in three in four cases taken there from Britain . The ten backbench Tory MPs say there is a need to ‘end rule by judges and reinstate Parliamentary democracy’. Their challenge follows a succession of sickening cases in which terrorists, murderers and sex offenders have been awarded cash after gaining judgments against the Government. The report, commissioned by the MPs from legal researcher Robert Broadhurst, says that since Britain subscribed to the jurisdiction of the ECHR in 1966 there have been more than 350 rulings on whether the UK has violated convention rights. The number of judgments made against the UK is 271, against only 86 in which it was successful. In a further 50 cases the UK reached a settlement with the claimant, typically agreeing to pay out in return for an agreement to drop the case. In the 1980s, the average number of cases concluded by the ECHR concerning alleged UK violation of human rights law was 2.6 per year. In the 1990s it tripled to 7.8 – and in the 2000s it almost tripled again to 29.3. Taking charge: David Cameron is planning to use a speech to call for rule changes which he hopes to implement during Britain's presidency of the Council of Europe . The judgments have been blamed for allowing scores of foreign criminals and terrorists to claim they have a ‘human right’ to remain in the UK. The European court has 47 judges, representing every member state of the Council of Europe including Liechtenstein, San Marino, Monaco and Andorra. A recent report estimated that 20 of them have no judicial experience. Many cannot speak English. The timing of the report is crucial as Strasbourg prepares to pass judgment in three controversial cases. In the first, prisoner voting will . come before the Grand Chamber, Strasbourg’s final court of appeal. Britain is fighting an ECHR ruling that the government must allow . convicts to take part in elections – in clear defiance of the wishes of . the UK Parliament, which last year voted overwhelmingly to maintain the . current ban. In the second, preacher of hate Abu Hamza is resisting extradition to the U.S. to face trial on terror charges, and the ECHR will rule on whether he can be sent for trial. If it refuses, the British authorities face the prospect of having to release the fanatic back on to the streets. The final case involves three killers given ‘whole-life’ tariffs by the British courts, which have ruled their crimes are so grave that they can never be released and must die behind bars. Court battles: Jeremy Bamber's case involving his 'whole-life' tariff for murder and a decision on whether Abu Hamza can be extradited to the U.S. to face trial are two of the upcoming cases the ECHR is to rule on . If Jeremy Bamber, Peter Moore and . Douglas Vinter win their case, it will force the Government to give . regular reviews to every one of the 40 or so prisoners locked up for . ever – and allow them to petition for their release. Report: Former MEP Chris Heaton-Harris is the chairman of the group calling on Mr Cameron to take action . In their foreword to Mr Broadhurst’s report, the MPs, headed by ex-MEP Chris Heaton-Harris, say: ‘The main problem with current human rights law is that we all have to accept judges’ interpretations of human rights, even when those interpretations strike us as a gross distortion of such rights. Who really believes that some or all convicted prisoners have an inherent right to vote while they are behind bars for their crime? Not us.’ The report calls for the UK Parliament to be given the power to overturn ECHR judgments. Such a move would require the approval of all other signatories to the ECHR. Should this not prove possible, ‘the only viable option would be for the UK to extract itself from the jurisdiction of the Strasbourg court altogether’. The report says that, by introducing a British Bill of Rights, the country could still meet its obligations to respect human rights. The author claims this would most probably prevent Britain from being ejected from the Council of Europe – parent body of the ECHR. David Cameron promised at the weekend to take personal charge of the issue, during Britain’s presidency of the  Council of Europe. He is planning to make a speech in Strasbourg calling for rule changes which would stop the ECHR being able to deal with cases if they have already been dealt with ‘properly’ by national courts.","Ten Tory MPs call on Prime Minister to take action .

"The church has written a 3,500-word article on the misconception . In 'The Book of Mormon' a fictional missionary sings, 'I believe that God has a plan... I believe that plan involved me getting my own planet' The Mormon Church is pushing back against the notion that members of the faith are taught they'll get their own planet in the afterlife, a misconception popularized in pop culture most recently by the Broadway show 'The Book of Mormon.' A newly-posted article affirms the faith's belief that humans can become like God in eternity, but says the 'cartoonish image of people receiving their own planets' is not how members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints envision it. 'While few Latter-day Saints would identify with caricatures of having their own planet, most would agree that the awe inspired by creation hints at our creative potential in the eternities,' the article says. A newly-posted article, part of a series of recent online articles posted on the website of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, affirms the Mormon faith's belief that humans can become like God in eternity, but explains they do NOT get their own planets. The church's Salt Lake Temple is pictured here . The expectation of exaltation is more figurative and ambiguous than boiling it down to living on one planet, it says. 'Church members imagine exaltation less through images of what they will get and more through the relationships they have now and how those relationships might be purified and elevated,' the article says. The 3,500-word article is part of a series of recent online pieces posted on the church website that explain, expand or clarify on some of the more sensitive gospel topics. Past articles have addressed the faith's past ban on black men in the lay clergy and the early history of polygamy. The series of postings have been applauded by religious scholars who say the church is finally acknowledging some of the most controversial or sensitive parts of its history and doctrine that it once sidestepped. 'The church has become fully aware that scholarship and history is a double edge sword,' said Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion and the James Bostwick Chair of English at the University of Richmond. 'They can work in the church's favor, but they can also be unsettling.' The bit Broadway musical The Book of Mormon, seen here, spread the misconception . The new article, entitled 'Becoming Like God,' doesn't mention Kolob, referred to in the Book of Abraham as a planet or star closest to the throne of God. Kolob is mentioned in a Mormon hymn, but interpretations that it is the planet where God lives, or the place where church members will go when they die, read a great deal into an obscure verse in Mormon scripture, said Matthew Bowman, assistant professor of religion at Hampden-Sydney College. 'I'm not surprised it's not mentioned,' Bowman said. 'Even most Mormons aren't sure what exactly to make of the reference.' Kolob is believed to be the inspiration for the name of the planet, 'Kobol,' in the science fiction TV series, 'Battlestar Gallatica,' which was created by a Mormon. Kolob isn't mentioned in the Broadway show, 'The Book of Mormon' but a fictional Mormon missionary sings, 'I believe that God has a plan for all of us. I believe that plan involved me getting my own planet.' People commonly latch on to the most outrageous or unique aspects of religions, such as Amish people using horse and buggy, and that's how the perception of Mormons inheriting their own planets became widespread, Givens said. The series of postings, as well as the church's opening of its archive, shows a natural progression for a religion that is younger than other major worldwide faiths, Givens said. The church was founded in 1830 and took more than a century to hit 1 million members. Today, there are 15 million Mormons worldwide. 'Many of these things can be unsettling to members who have grown up with a typically manicured narrative, but it's a necessary part of the maturation for the church membership,' Givens said. The intent of the articles is to give Mormons and non-Mormons definitive places to go to study or learn about doctrinal issues. That could happen eventually but church leaders need to make people aware of them, said Armand Mauss, a retired professor of sociology and religious studies at Washington State University. And he said the article won't put an end to misconceptions held by some about Mormons. 'For devout members of other Christian denominations, especially those of the Evangelical variety, this statement will confirm their existing claims of outrageous Mormon heresies where doctrines of deity are concerned,' Mauss said.","The church has written a 3,500-word article on the misconception .

"According to the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, there are more than 33million refugees in the world. On what seems to be an entirely unrelated note, there are 700million wooden shipping palates produced each year in the United States - 150million of which find their way to landfill each year. But one project aims to bring these two facts together in a win-win scenario: converting those pallets into cheap, environmentally friendly houses which can be deployed quickly - and even turned into permanent homes. Scroll down for video . The future of homes? The Pallet House could help the 33million refugees and displaced people in the world . ...And with 700 million wooden shipping pallets produced in the U.S., there is potentially an ample supply of materials for the easy-to-assemble home . The homes are constructed out of the 150 million pallets that end up in landfills in the U.S. each year .

"An extra 130,000 primary school places are needed within three years due to soaring immigration and a high birth rate, figures reveal. Record numbers of families will face disappointment when primary schools are allocated next week, following a steep rise in applicants. This is partly due to the impact of immigration, as well as a booming birth rate and the fact that fewer middle class parents can afford to send their children to private school. An extra 130,000 primary school places are needed due to immigration and a soaring birth rate . Councils are already deploying emergency measures to deal with the influx, such as squeezing pupils into ‘bulge’ classes and using little-known legal powers to override class size limits. But as many as 100,000 pupils – one in five in some areas – are expected to miss out on their first-choice primary, with around ten pupils fighting for each place at some of the most sought-after schools. Bygrove Primary School in Tower Hamlets, East London – which was rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted – received 312 applications for just 30 places. It has been reported that some parents are even resorting to cheating to win offers from their chosen schools, by providing fake addresses or lying about sibling links. Councils contacted by the Mail cited a Local Government Association report, which found that 130,000 extra primary places will be needed by 2017 – the equivalent of 4,750 classes or around 500 primary schools. Almost 90,000 additional places have already been created this academic year. Areas under the most pressure include Bristol and Manchester, as well as parts of London such as Croydon, Harrow, Waltham Forest and Newham, many of which are home to high numbers of migrant families. A report revealed on Thursday that officials drastically underestimated levels of immigration, missing 350,000 migrants from Eastern Europe after checking the wrong airports. Croydon alone needs to create 13,501 more places – 43 per cent of its current capacity – and in Harrow, applications have risen 14.8 per cent compared with last year. About half of councils that responded to the Mail’s survey said they were using ‘bulge’ classes – a one-off extra reception class that continues through the school. Meanwhile in Leicester, the council has recently used powers to provide extra places through an agreed ‘overfilling’ of classes in the first three years of primary school. The policy can only be used for applicants who are new to the area. In other local authorities, disused office blocks are being turned into classrooms, and existing schools are being frantically expanded. In Brighton and Hove – where it has emerged that more than one in six primary pupils will miss out on their preferred school this year – the council is converting a former police station into extra classrooms. Around one-in-five pupils in some areas will miss out on their first choice primary school . The survey also suggests there has been an increase in the number of parents trying to play the system by lying about their child’s address. In Lambeth, the council will be issuing some ‘conditional offers’ to about a dozen families as it pursues anti-fraud investigations. And in Hartlepool, eight suspicious cases were investigated during the current admissions round, six of which were found to be fraudulent. Four were investigated last year. According to the Office for National Statistics, the UK population is set to increase by almost ten million over the next 25 years. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We are increasing the number of good school places by tackling under performance and opening new free schools and academies. ‘We have more than doubled to £5billion the funding available to local authorities to create new school places and we are allowing good schools to expand without the restrictions and bureaucracy they faced in the past.’","Steep rise in the number of applications to primary schools .

"Leisure time: Shaun Clemens-Cooney, who was behind a £300,000 cannabis factory in Blackburn . A builder converted a newly-built house into a £300,000 cannabis factory - after council planners told him he could only use it as a 'leisure facility.' Shaun Clemens-Cooney, 43, wanted to build the three-bedroomed detached home at the back of his own £200,000 semi-detached house in Blackburn - but had been refused planning permission three times. Finally, inspectors agreed he could build the property - but only after he promised he would only use the upper floors for 'leisure purposes', including a playroom for a billiard table and another for a model railway. Yet after construction boss Clemens-Cooney finished his project, police received a tip-off about the nature of the property's 'leisure facilities.' During a raid in May last year officers opened the roller shutters of the double garage - and were faced with a plaster board wall behind which they could hear fans whirring away. They then discovered 600 marijuana plant, being grown in 3,000 pots across all the three floors of the property. They also found a sophisticated hydroponic irrigation system complete with extraction ducts and discovered Clemens-Cooney had also rigged the electricity supply at his own home to steal £20,000 worth of power to supply light, water and air filtration. Today Clemens-Cooney, from Blackburn, Lancashire, is starting three years in jail after he was convicted of producing cannabis following a 12-day trial. Boarded up: Clemens-Cooney blacked out the windows and boarded up the doors to keep his facilities secret . One of his tenants Morgan Redmayne, 44, of Darwen was jailed for two and a half years for cannabis production. After the case a neighbour, who asked not be named, said: 'Council planners may have told Shaun he could only use the property for leisure purposes but obviously his idea of leisure purposes was far from their minds when they let him build it. Also jailed: Tenant Morgan Redmayne must serve two and a half years . 'The reality was Shaun was pretty cross with the council when it refused him permission and we wouldn't be surprised if he finished the building off with a view to using it as a custom-built cannabis farm. 'He had already started building the house when he was found out, and ordered to submit planning permission but the dispute went on for years and must have cost him a considerable a fortune. 'Maybe he thought growing cannabis was a way of getting back some of his money.' Clemens-Cooney who is company secretary of Millbrooke Construction in Darwen and owns up to seven properties hit trouble in February 2007, when he was caught trying to build an eighth house on half an acre of land behind his family home without the right permissions. Over a two year period officials at Blackburn with Darwen Council repeatedly refused planning permission for the property saying it would have a 'dominant, overbearing impact to neighbouring dwellings, to the detriment of residential amenity.' A report said the proposal would be 'out of character with adjacent properties and the surrounding area in general.' But in January 2010 Clemens-Cooney . applied again this time saying the detached property would now be a . double garage and games room and offered drawings showing a 'playroom' and 'model railway room' as well as office space and a utility room. The . following the March officials said they would only grant permission for . the property to be completed on condition it would not be used as . 'habitable accommodation.' He later completed the house and even showed . it off on his company website. Another neighbour said: 'The property was built about three years ago, and it is quite an eyesore and nobody likes it. 'But . we had no indication that it was a cannabis farm, we never smelt . anything and you couldn't tell it was lit up because the windows were . whitewashed.' Out of character: The 'cannabis house' was hidden behind Clemens-Cooney's own house . What officers might have expected to find: Clemens-Cooney told planning officers the upstairs would be used for projects such as a model railway . The neighbour added: 'There was nothing suspicious about it either, no suspicion coming and goings and I kept a pretty good eye on it. I wouldn't say I was shocked when I found out what was going on - more surprised I'd say - but not surprised when I found out it was him. 'There were two fake garage doors at the front and behind that was a breeze block. The windows on the front were all white washed so you could never see in. It took about two days for the police to bring out all the plants. 'We were told there were 600 cannabis plants but there must have been about 3,000 plant pots which in the end were given to the local garden centre. 'The plants were between 6ft and 9ft high and had been being cropped. He must have had a lot of heaters in there too. 'He must have put ducts in there that took out the smell so we could never smell anything because it went out the other way. Even when we were sat out in summer we couldn't smell anything.

"Some 45 people were killed yesterday - including at least 12 children - as government forces widened a bombing campaign in rebel-held areas of Syria, activists said. One strike hit Syria's largest city of Aleppo, while another on the Turkish border town of Azaz was claimed to be the latest attack using powerful-but-inaccurate ‘barrel bombs’ on the northern region.

"Desperate to burn the calories but really can't be bothered to leave your bed? The latest Hollywood craze might be just the ticket. Bulk perspiration, which involves being wrapped in something akin to an extremely hot electric blanket that promises to burn 1,000 calories a session, is fast becoming a weight loss sensation in LA. According to The Mirror, the 'urban sweat lodges' are frequented by the likes of Demi Moore and the Kardashians. Sweat it out: Demi Moore (left) is a big fan of the treatment, which is offered at the likes of the Shape House in LA (pictured right with founder Sophie Chiche), and promises to burn 1,000 calories in an hour session . The hour-long session, which costs £30, sees you wrapped up in a padded infrared foil blanket which is slowly heated to 75C - that's twice the temperature of the Saudi Arabian desert. But how does it work? 'Infrared energy produces a uniform deep heat penetration without the usual sensation of feeling hot. This is achieved by using a specific Infrared band of energy peaking at around 9.4 micons; a level designed to penetrate beyond the skin (where heat is most acutely felt) to a depth where fat resides,' reads the Shape House's website, a salon offering the treatment in LA. 'As this subcutaneous fat begins to heat, your body begins to thermo-regulate itself by producing sweat. All wrapped up: The hour-long session, which costs £30, sees you wrapped up into a padded infrared foil blanket which is slowly heated to 75C . 'And in the process of sweating, the multiple benefits are achieved… detoxing, skin conditioning, cardio fitness, relaxation, weight loss, and emotional health.' Sophie Chiche, founder of the Shape House in Larchmont, Los Angeles, told the paper: 'This technology was originally used in France helping to fuse broken bones. But people found they slept better and their skin and digestion improved. 'It burns a lot of calories, not just from water loss, but because the body, heated to 70-75 degrees, is tricked into thinking it has a fever. 'So as the temperature goes up, up and up, the body tries to go down, down, down. This requires a lot of energy. 'Toxins are stored as a layer of fat . protecting your organs. By sweating, you lose toxins and your body no . longer needs this barrier and the water we retain from stress is . removed.' Sophie, who once . weighed 23st, swears by the method herself.

Keeping up: Thanks to Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian, who paid a visit to the Shape House in their hit reality show, there is a lengthy waiting list . But does it work and, most importantly, is it safe? Dr Marilyn Glenville PhD, nutritionist specialising in women's health from www.marilynglenville.com, said: 'A sweat lodge has been traditionally used as an ancient ceremony for centuries. It was used for marriages, births, death anything where there was a new beginning or change in life. 'But it is very different from the urban sweat lodge suggested here. In a traditional sweat lodge hot stones are used and it is the steam that comes from the rocks that is supposed to help clear out toxins. The urban sweat lodge is not using steam but the equivalent of an electric blanket (using infrared) to heat up the body. There will be contraindications for some people who have heart problems, high blood pressure, during menstruation and in pregnancy. 'But my biggest concern is that if people are using it for weight loss, it is not changing any of the unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as eating unhealthy foods and not exercising. So people are looking at it as a quick fix.'","Shape House in LA featured on Keeping Up With The Kardashians .

"By . Barbara Davies for the Daily Mail . Updated: . 02:20 EST, 29 July 2011 . The guest list of old boys who gathered earlier this month for the bicentenary of The Eton Society read like a Who's Who of some of the most illustrious and wealthy members of British society. Mingling in a marquee on the lawn known as Fellows' Eyot, they shared anecdotes about their membership of the school's most prestigious club, known as 'Pop', a self-electing group of the most popular and sporty sixth-formers. Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, was there, along with Douglas Hurd and William Waldegrave, Jonathan Aitken, Lord Vestey, racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks and Sir William Gladstone - great-grandson of the Prime Minister whose name he bears. Then: Alex Cameron (left) was more popular and sporty than the PM (right) Now: Sibling rivalry pushed David Cameron to become Prime Minister . So, too, was Alexander Cameron QC, older brother of our current Prime Minister - whose absence from this select group was the cause of much amusement among those present. For it was not that David Cameron was unavailable that night. He wasn't even eligible. While his older brother had been a member of Pop at school, David never made the grade. Which is why, at the end of a £250-a-head dinner, Boris Johnson joked that those who weren't elected to Pop were sometimes so damaged by their feelings of rejection they acquired a burning ambition to become Prime Minister to make up for the humiliation. It was a gentle quip, but one which might well have hit a raw nerve with the PM had he heard it. In an interview this week, he opened up about the sibling rivalry which dogged his childhood, describing Alex, at 47 three years his senior, as a 'huge success' on the sports field and 'almost always lead actor' in school plays. His comments came in the latest issue of the Big Issue magazine, which the Prime Minister guest edited. He spoke about his childhood for one of the magazine's columns: 'Letter to my younger self.' 'I lived in the shadow of my older brother,' Mr Cameron admitted. 'He was three years older, went to the same school and was a huge success. It was great to have that kind of role model and I was incredibly proud of him, but like many younger brothers you find yourself always a few steps behind.' So who is the brother who once cast such a shadow on the PM? He is Allan Alexander Cameron, a man who, as one of Britain's top barristers, has worked on some of the most high-profile legal cases of recent years. He successfully fought the extradition of General Pinochet, defended Jonathan Aitken and Jeffrey Archer in their perjury trials, and recently defended Pakistani cricketer Mohammad Asif against allegations of match-fixing. Boris Johnson: The mayor joked that Cameron was spurred on to become PM after being rejected from the popular group . Said to earn more than £1 million a year, Alex Cameron was just 39 when he took silk as a Queen's Counsel and is described by law guide Chambers UK as a 'phenomenon' with 'enthralling advocacy skills' and a 'delightful bedside manner'. Married to fellow barrister Sarah Fearnley-Whittingstall, cousin of chef Hugh, he has two children, Imogen, 19, and 17-year-old old Angus. Alex is clearly as driven towards success as his brother. The family resemblance is also unmistakable, although Alex is silver-haired and a little fuller-figured. Their competitive streak stems back to their childhood in a former rectory near Newbury, Berkshire. Alex is the eldest of the four children born to wealthy stockbroker Ian Cameron and his wife, Mary. A daughter, Tania, followed. David was the third-born, his sister Clare is the youngest. David followed his brother to Greenwood pre-preparatory school near Newbury. His biographers, Frances Elliott and James Hanning, in Cameron, The Rise Of The New Conservative, say it was during these years that the seeds of sibling rivalry were sown over fiercely competitive games of tennis and cricket. For the latter sport they organised annual matches between teams captained by each of the brothers. In 1974, aged seven, David was sent to board at Heatherdown prep school near Ascot in Berkshire, a feeder school for Eton, following in the footsteps of his older, often more successful, brother. A few months later, both brothers appeared in a school production of Toad Of Toad Hall watched by, among other parents, the Queen and Prince Philip, who were there to see 11-year-old Prince Edward performing as Mole. Alex, one of Edward's closest friends at school and already marked out for his fine acting and public speaking skills, had the coveted role of Rat. David, was given a smaller part, listed in the programme as 'Harold Rabbit'. High-powered: The brothers at their day jobs . Both brothers played for the school's cricket First XI, although contemporary accounts recall it was Alex who shone as a sportsman. But it was at Eton, where David arrived in 1979, that he really felt the burden of a successful and talented older brother. A contemporary says: 'Alex was always the one mothers would want their daughters to marry. He was effortlessly charming and debonaire - very much the natural head boy type. 'If you'd had to vote then for which of the two brothers you thought might become Prime Minister, it would have been Alex every time.' Not least because Alex Cameron was also an instant academic success, while David, a late developer, traipsed behind somewhat. However it was Cameron junior's failure to get into Pop that must have really hurt. Those chosen are entitled to wear a special uniform: a black tail coat with braid piping, spongebag trousers in a houndstooth check, a starched wing collar with a white bow tie and a waistcoat made from any fabric they desired. According to Old Etonian Bill Coles, who was the year below Alex and two years above David at the £30,000-a-year school: 'Not getting into Pop was one hell of a big deal. It would have been a complete slap in the face for David and probably goes in part to explain his ambitions as a politician.' Coles, author of the spoof novel David Cameron's Schooldays, points out that the high-octane atmosphere at Eton would have placed the brothers in direct competition. 'Even without an older brother who is doing well, it would have been highly competitive,' says Coles. 'The school was full of alpha males. David and Alex were in the same house. And younger brothers are always left in the shadow of older brothers. David may well have left school feeling he had an awful lot still to prove.' School days: It was at Eton that Davis Cameron really felt the pressure of having a successful older brother . Immediately after school, Cameron followed in Alex's footsteps again, heading to Hong Kong for three months to work for the Jardine Matheson shipping agency. By now, Alex was studying law at Bristol University. And here, at last, David got one up on him - winning a place at Oxford to read politics, philosophy and economics. Thanks, in part, to their late father's work ethic and high standards, both were determined to succeed in their chosen fields. As David told the Big Issue: 'If I could give my younger self some advice, I'd say: ""Don't worry about it. Your life is not pre-determined. You'll find your own feet in your own way."" It was not until I left school that I felt I was breaking out of my brother's shadow.' As David found his feet on his long climb up the political ladder, Alex moved into his childhood family home with his wife and children, while Ian and Mary Cameron moved into a smaller, adjacent house. Ian Cameron once said that his sons had 'completely separate roles'. Certainly, sibling rivalry, or 'younger brother syndrome' as David once put it, has never got in the way of family loyalties. The brothers have always been close. Alex encouraged David to enter the Conservative leadership race, apparently saying: 'You've got to go for it.' Yet even when it came to reaching the peaks of their professions, Alex got there first. Just weeks before David became Prime Minister, Alex was voted head of his chambers at Three Raymond Buildings. 'A man for the big occasion,' is how his peers describe him. 'Hardworking and very solid in his approach'; 'universally loved'. Characteristics that would have made him a fine Prime Minister, if he had chosen politics instead of the law. Perhaps David should count himself lucky that so far Alex has confined his political interests to a more modest stage: he is chairman of his parish council. Burning issues of late have included whether to replace towels with hand-dryers in the village pavilion and whether a bus stop would be an unsightly addition to the parish. With the weight of the nation's woes upon him in his great office of State, David may no longer feel overshadowed by his big brother - but what's the betting there aren't days when he still envies him?","'I lived in the shadow of my older .

"John Terry will stay at Chelsea after Jose Mourinho confirmed he will sign a one-year extension at the end of the season. Terry, 34, who most recently signed a one-year contract extension back in May 2014, is one of only three players, alongside Branislav Ivanovic and Eden Hazard, to have started all of his side's league games this term. And he is set to be rewarded for his fine form, producing stellar performance after performance, with the Blues currently sitting seven points clear at the top of the Premier League. Jose Mourinho says John Terry will sign a new one-year deal with Chelsea at the end of the season . Terry's Chelsea career will prolong into an 18th season following the news he will sign a contract extension . Terry has enjoyed a brilliant season and hopes to continue his career at Stamford Bridge for another year . Debut: Aston Villa (H), October 28 1998 . Appearances: 656 . Honours: Three Premier League titles, Five FA Cups, Two League Cups, Two Community Shields, One Champions League, One Europa League . 'John accepted that we go year-after-year, with a smile,' said Mourinho. 'He accepted the challenge and he won it and he is winning the challenge and the right to get one more year. 'That is what the club wants, that’s what John wants and that is going to happen.’ The news means Terry's Chelsea career will prolong into an 18th season, with both parties keen on getting the deal over the line. The centre-half accepts Chelsea’s policy of awarding 12-month extensions to players over 30, but wants to remain at Stamford Bridge despite that. Terry, the former England captain, made his first-team debut for the club back in October 1998 against Aston Villa in the League Cup, and has since gone on to make another 655 appearances.

Elsewhere, Chelsea recently tied  Hazard down to a five-and-half-year contract extension, news which Terry described as 'the most important for the club'. Mourinho added that he does not expect to sign a new contract himself, although he ruled out the possibility of leaving Stamford Bridge in the near future. ‘I have two more years of my contract,' he said. 'I am not waiting for offers, I am not going to give any space for speculation or for interest from other clubs. I want to stay, I don’t want to go. ‘I don’t need an new contract right now.

The centre-half celebrates FA Cup and Community Shield success with former Chelsea man Frank Lampard . Speaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea's game against Burnley on Saturday, Mourinho also raised concerns over the treatment Hazard received in the Champions League last-16 first-leg tie against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday night, as he was fouled a record-breaking nine times. He said: 'Hazard is a lucky boy not to be injured. During the game I was aware of the number of fouls, but I was aware that every time he had the ball he was surrounded and fouled. 'The dimension on the fouls, some of them were really dangerous. He is a lucky kid - he is fair and honest, he deserves to be honest. 'He deserves that luck, the kind he got at Stoke for example. He is honest, he is loyal, he does not provoke opponents and does not start doing tricks to provoke people and create emotional reactions. 'In this moment the fouls are over the line. I am proud of him by being honest on the pitch and I leave it with the authorities to do something.' Marco Verratti goes in with studs showing during PSG's Champions League clash with Chelsea .

"Birth dearth: Policy makers are now throwing money at families in a bid to stem the birth dearth and encourage citizens to have more babies. But experts say it is not working . Germany is battling a baby drought that has caused its population to plummet, leaving a rash of vacant homes, dry sewers and fears the economy may crumble, experts have warned. In its most recent census, Germany discovered it had lost 1.5 million inhabitants and, by 2060, experts say the population could dwindle by an extra 19 per cent, to about 66 million. Between 2000 and 2013, Germany's . birth rate dropped by 11 per cent compared to rises in the UK (4.3 per . cent), France (3.6 per cent), Spain (12.8 per cent) and Ireland (8.9 per cent). Now panic is beginning to spread through Europe's economic powerhouse as the financial crisis continues to stretch its tentacles into all aspects of society, especially the country's labour market. Adding to the country's woes, a recent study by Europe's Population Policy Acceptance Study found that 23 per cent of German men thought 'zero' was the ideal family size. 'In some areas, there are now abundant overgrown yards, boarded-up . windows and concerns about sewage systems too empty to work properly,' reports the New York Times. 'The work force is rapidly graying, and assembly lines are being . redesigned to minimize bending and lifting.' Policy makers are now throwing money at families in a bid to stem the birth dearth and encourage citizens to have more babies. But despite spending $265 billion a year on family subsidies, experts say the government is not doing enough claiming Germany needs an overhaul of values, customs and attitudes. According to the New York Times Germany has for many decades had a fraught relationship with immigration. To make matters worse, attitudes to working mothers remains unsympathetic in Germany where women who juggle jobs with children are commonly referred to pejoratively as 'raven mothers', implying neglectfulness. Experts are now claiming Germany needs to find ways of keeping older workers in jobs for longer and make itself more appealing to immigrants, who, they say, tend to find other European nations far more hospitable destinations. It also needs to feed more women into the workforce while, at the same time, encourage them to have more babies. 'If you look closely at the numbers, what you see is the higher the gender equality, the higher the birthrate,' Reiner Klingholz of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development told the New York Times. Keep working: Experts are now claiming Germany needs to find ways of keeping older workers in jobs for longer as fears grow for the country's workforce . But, he added, Germany has long subsidised families of a traditional set up, making change all the more difficult. 'Touching those is political suicide,' Michaela Kreyenfeld of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research told the paper. 'Women are perfectly integrated within Germany's labor market but when it comes to babies, everyone expects a mother to stay at home and take care of the children,' she told reuters last year. 'This of course deters women from becoming mothers.' Last year it emerged the number of births in Germany fell to a post-war low despite a raft of government incentives meant to reverse a population decline. 'Raven mother': Attitudes to working mothers remains unsympathetic in Germany where women who juggle jobs with children are commonly referred to pejoratively as 'raven mothers', implying neglectfulness . A third of all babies born in Germany, still the EU's most populous member state, came from immigrant families, the analysts said, noting that without them the overall figure would have been much lower. The preliminary data released by Germany's Federal Statistics Office showed 663,000 children were born in 2011, down from 678,000 in 2010. How Germany's birth rate compares to Europe (between 2000 and 2013): . 'As in every year since 1972, the number of people who died was greater than the number of children born. In 2011 the difference amounted to 190,000 people and in 2010 to 181,000,' the office said in a report. Demography experts have forecast that Germany's population could shrink to about 50 million by 2050, based on current trends, and say France and Britain - which now have about 60 million each - could overtake it later this century. Germany's birthrate peaked in 1964 when a total of 1,357,304 children were born in the capitalist West and communist East. West Germans were already having fewer children in the 1970s because of improving conditions for women and their easier access to education, said Reiner Klingholz, director of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development. 'So fewer children were born then, meaning that today we lack potential parents for potential children,"" he said.Without immigrant families, the number of newly born children in Germany would reach only 400,000 in a country of 82 million, Klingholz said. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has no children herself, introduced relatively generous child benefit payments in 2006, making it easier for women to return to the workplace after having children.In June 2012, however, in a move critics say entrenches a more traditionalist view of women's roles, Merkel's coalition also approved a bill on childcare payments that would give parents an allowance to keep their toddlers at home rather than sending them to nursery.","Germany lost 1.5 million inhabitants in its most recent census .

"Teeth found in a fire believed to have been set by a cannibal to cook his victim match those of a missing German adventurer. German media today reported that investigators are now certain renegade South Sea guide and hunter Henri Haiti killed, dismembered and ate Stefan Ramin on a round-the-world trip with his partner. Bild, Germany's biggest newspaper, said: 'It is the suspicion of the authorities that the hunter carved his victim up, ate parts of the body and burned the remainder along with animals cadavers. 'He is regarded as a cannibal.' World tour: Stefan Rami and Heike Dorsch at one of the idyllic locations they visited before the horrific episode . Jose Thorel, prosecutor on the island near Tahiti were the gruesome discovery was made, said: 'It is almost certain the remains we found in the fire are those of Stefan Ramin.' It is understood that, despite DNA testing that will take weeks to complete, a dental file sent from Germany to the island of Papeete where the charred bones were sent for analysis shows the remains to be positively identified as his. The hunt has intensified on the paradise island of Nuku Hiva for Haiti, 31, whose knowledge of the bushland where authorities say he led his victim is unparalleled, giving him a huge advantage over his pursuers. Wanted: Guide Henri Haiti is still missing and soldiers are helping police hunt for him . Further examination of the site where Mr Ramin's remains were discovered showed how fierce the fire was that consumed him. Leaves 25ft up show evidence of scorch marks and ash, clothes, teeth and bone fragments were found over a 35 foot radius. On Monday it was confirmed the BKA, Germany's equivalent of the FBI, is now involved with French authorities in the hunt for Mr Ramin's killer. The 40-year-old from the small town of Haselau in north-west Germany was on a round-the-world trip with girlfriend Heike Dorsch, 37, when they anchored off the coast of the Polynesian island on September 16. He went off on a goat hunt with Haiti - a guide registered with authorities on the island - and never returned. Police say Haiti went back to the boat to try to lure Miss Dorsch into the jungle claiming he had had an accident. She was suspicious and refused to go with him. He ended up sexually assaulting her and tying her to a tree. It was only on Wednesday last week that the human remains were found. Among the embers were bones including a jaw bone, teeth and melted metal - believed to be fillings. Mr Ramin, a fanatical sailor, was a former business adviser. He kept a regular blog of his trip begun in 2008 and one of his last entries read: 'I seek freedom and adventures'. The German traveller is feared to have been eaten during his visit to French Polynesia . A family friend said: 'It is a tragedy that a man with such a zest for life should have his days ended in such a brutal fashion.' He bought his catamaran Baju in Turkey and had planned to spend the next two years island hopping in the South Pacific. On Facebook, he listed his interests as 'travelling, blue water sailing, kiting, kitesurfing, windsurfing, surfing, diving... actually everything which one can do on and under the water'. Last month, they dropped anchor in Nuku Hiva, largest of the Marquesas islands, which over the centuries have featured in many reports of cannibalism. Deborah Kimitete, deputy mayor of Nuku Hiva, told local news website Les Nouvelles: 'No one can believe what has happened. This has never happened here before, this is the first time, it's horrible.' Mr Ramin and Miss Heike began their travels in 2008 and dropped anchor in Nuku Hiva last month . It was not clear whether Miss Dorsch is still on the island or whether she has returned home to Germany. Nuku Hiva has a population of just over 2,000 and featured in the stories of Herman Melville, author of Moby Dick. Outside of horror films, cannibalism is virtually unheard of in the modern world. The Korowai of Papua New Guinea are one of the last surviving tribes to eat humans as a cultural practice.

"Would-be MP: Clive Lewis has urged union bosses to use Press law to silence critical newspapers . A Labour candidate has urged union bosses to use new Press regulations to launch class action complaints against newspapers who criticise them. Clive Lewis – who is a member of three unions – criticised the Daily Mail’s exposure of bullying by Unite thugs. In a chilling insight into the way Left-wingers plan to use the Royal Charter, the would-be MP said unions should get together to file complaints to combat ‘scurrilous’ reporting. He told a new trade union think tank that in the past, only people specifically affected by a news story have been able to launch a grievance against a newspaper. But under the terms of the Royal Charter – approved by the Privy Council last month to the delight of the Hacked Off pressure group – third party groups will be able to complain en masse in so-called class action cases. The measure has been opposed by newspaper industry groups, who say it is likely to be used by activists to deter legitimate investigative journalism. The Mail revealed how Unite thugs targeted the families and neighbours of staff at the Grangemouth petrochemical plant in Scotland during strike action last month. The paper has also led the way in covering the scandal in Falkirk, where Unite was accused of seeking to rig a Labour candidate selection. Critical: Mr Lewis has criticised the Daily Mail's exposure of bullying by Unite thugs. Above, Saturday's Mail . Stephen Deans, the Unite boss in Scotland who was also chairman of Falkirk West Labour Party, has now lost his job at Grangemouth and the local party has been taken into special measures. However, Labour candidate Mr Lewis has sought to paint Mr Deans – whose fight with the owners of Grangemouth nearly led to the plant closing – as a wronged man. In a speech to the Unite-sponsored Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class), he said: ‘Let’s take for example the case of the chap who has had his life ruined by scurrilous accusations and innuendo in the Daily Mail. 'Under the new Royal Charter, his trade . union, as an interested third party, could say actually, “We now have an . interest in this.

Unite boss Stephen Deans, left, who was also chairman of Falkirk West Labour Party, has now lost his job at Grangemouth, while Ed Miliband, right, is refusing to open his party's inquiry into the Falkirk scandal . 'We think this generalisation affects not just him but all the trade union movement and its members and we are going to put in an official complaint and take this through the process”.’ Mr Lewis, the candidate for  Norwich South, describes himself on his Twitter account as a ‘proud socialist’ and former BBC reporter. He is a member of three unions – Unite, the GMB and the National Union of Journalists. Shipley MP Philip Davies, one of 15 . Conservatives who voted against the Charter earlier this year, said the . unions will use their financial muscle to ‘bully hard-pressed . newspapers’. ‘All that will happen is that newspapers will be afraid to publish things that are in the public interest,’ he said. Mr Davies also praised the Mail’s reporting of Unite’s activities, adding: ‘Not only are they intimidating people in industrial disputes they’re now trying to intimidate people who write about it.’ Kent MP Tracey Crouch, another Charter Tory rebel, said: ‘It is just the sort of behaviour that newspapers have warned about.’ Yesterday Ed Miliband again refused to re-open his party’s inquiry into Falkirk, calling for people to ‘move on’ – despite the evidence that his officials never got to the bottom of what happened.","Labour candidate Clive Lewis has urged unions to use new Press regulations to silence critical newspapers .

"Lessons: Tory Nick Boles has been learning Hebrew since he had a civil partnership with Israeli Shay Meshulam . A Tory MP was under fire last night for charging taxpayers for lessons he took to learn his partner’s language. Nick Boles has spent £678.80 on studying Hebrew after entering into a civil partnership with Shay Meshulam last year. Mr Boles, who has called for pensioners to be stripped of free prescriptions, winter fuel payments and bus passes, claims he is ‘entitled’ to learn the ancient Jewish language. The Grantham MP met Mr Meshulam on a Conservative Friends of Israel trip and they had a civil ceremony last March. He is not the first MP to put language lessons on expenses. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt charged taxpayers over £3,000 to learn Mandarin after marrying a Chinese woman. The pair are among nine MPs who got free classes in the last financial year. Mr Boles said: ‘Language instruction is a service available to Members of Parliament. I took some Hebrew lessons. It is something I’m entitled to do.’ Mr Boles is tipped by some party insiders for promotion, but his expenses claim could prove embarrassing. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Nick Boles has abused this taxpayer-funded perk in order to make conversation around the breakfast table a little easier.’ Rules: MPs can take language lessons if it helps with their work in Parliament . 'If MPs want to learn the language of a . foreign partner then they should pay for it themselves, not expect . taxpayers to pick up the bill. 'Mr Boles' unapologetic response is . particular galling, given that an attitude of entitlement was one of the . root causes of the expenses crisis in the last Parliament.' Last month Mr Boles said free bus passes and prescriptions must be axed for better-off pensioners. He also wants other universal benefits, such as free television licences for the over 75s and winter fuel payments, to be means-tested from 2015. Mr Boles conceded it will be politically difficult but insists that the Government must admit it cannot continue to protect the payments after the next election. In a speech to the independent think tank, the Resolution Foundation, he said: 'If we are going to protect spending on pensions – as we should – equity between the generations requires that these cuts cannot only fall on adults of working age. ‘We need to acknowledge now that we will not be able to continue the protection of these other benefits for better-off pensioners after 2015.'","Nick Boles has put £678.80 on his expenses for language lessons .

"Several big name beauty companies have been forced to remove a logo that declares them free of animal cruelty after they decided to sell their products in China. L'Occitane, Yves Rocher and Caudalie are among the high end brands that can no longer use the internationally-recognised official Leaping Bunny logo to show their cosmetics are free from animal testing. It comes after the firms decided to start selling to China where animal testing on beauty products for human use is still required by law. Going global: Big-name beauty brands have changed their animal testing policies so they can start selling their products in China (posed by model) Cosmetic sales in China increased by 18 per cent to £10billion last year - making it an attractive financial prospect. But many companies selling their products in the country have been asked to fund animal testing of their products in Chinese laboratories in order for them to be sold to the public. Cruelty Free International chief executive Michelle Thew said: 'The Humane Standards, symbolised by the . Leaping Bunny logo, is the most rigorous international cruelty-free . certification in the world. 'Each company is regularly audited to . ensure that no animal testing takes place throughout each company’s . entire supply chain. 'Where companies no longer comply with . the Humane Standards, the right to use the Leaping Bunny logo is . retracted. 'Following discussion with L’Occitane, its . certification was retracted in mid-December. 'Some companies wish to bring ethical beauty to China, however this is not . currently possible until China changes its current policy which requires animal . testing. 'I am disappointed that certain companies have fallen prey to the lure . of the Chinese market and are letting animals pay the price. Consumer pressure . can make a difference. The Leaping Bunny logo is used by brands that don't test on animals, useful for ethically-conscious beauty fans . Emerging market: China requires that all cosmetics for human use are first tested on animals (pictured above is a make-up artist at work in Shanghai) 'We certify over 400 companies around the world that refuse . to allow animal testing into their products, so there is plenty of choice for . everyone who wishes to eliminate this cruel, unnecessary and outdated practice. 'The only way that you can avoid animal testing in your toiletries and beauty . products is by looking for the Leaping Bunny logo, or checking www.GoCrueltyFree.org.' Britain banned animal testing in 1998 . and several large cosmetics companies including Paul Mitchell, . Sainbury's, The Co-operative, Superdrug, Marks & Spencer all have . Leaping Bunny certification meaning they are cruelty-free. Hair-care giant John Paul Mitchell Systems pulled out of China after being informed that the company would have to pay for animal tests in order to continue selling its products there. Paul Mitchell CEO and co-founder John Paul DeJoria put sales in China on hold last year and confirmed they will not sell products in that country in order to remain committed to the company's cruelty-free policy. Mr DeJoria said: 'Since Paul Mitchell was founded in 1980, we have been cruelty-free. 'We do not conduct or condone animal testing on our products, and we will not attempt to market our products in China until alternatives to animal testing methods have been accepted by the government. 'Paul Mitchell always has been and always will be cruelty-free.' Leading the way: Marks & Spencer is one of several big UK firms that has cruelty-free Leaping Bunny approval for its own products . Dr Dan Lyons, Campaigns Director of . internal animal protection organisation Uncaged, said it is down to individual companies to make a stand. He continued: 'It's a . fundamental decision companies need to make. 'It's much better if they stick to . their principles and avoid China, which will put pressure on the . government to change their own policies. 'It's unnecessary for China to require repeat and totally unnecessary testing on these products.' Urban Decay has also recently decided to cancel its . plans to enter the Chinese market after being informed of the animal . testing requirements. Spokesman for the charity People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Foundation, Alistair Currie, said: 'We are seeing welcome signs of progress in China but their current animal testing requirements are a major factor pushing up cosmetics tests on animals globally. 'Companies who have turned their backs on their non-animal testing policies because of the lure of China have regressed a generation: their products are once again being dripped into rabbits' eyes and smeared onto animals' abraded skin. 'While many progressive and principled companies are sticking to their non-animal testing policies, others need more motivation.' But the revelation that some large name brands are giving up their cruelty-free status to sell to China will come as a surprise to many shoppers. Even more surprisingly, there are many huge international brands including Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Revlon, which have never been able to use the Leaping Bunny logo because of their animal testing policies. And while an EU-wide ban on the marketing of animal-tested cosmetics is due to come into force next year, campaigners warn that the European Commission is now contemplating compromises or even delays to the legislation. Mr Currie continued: 'It's vital that the EU protect its own ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics due in 2013. 'We've led the world on this issue – we mustn't take any steps backward right here in our own back yard.' A spokesman for L'Occitane said: 'L'Occitane does not and never has tested its products on animals. 'Similarly, we insist that our suppliers certify that none of the ingredients we use are tested on animals. 'We do sell our products in China however and the Chinese government reserves the right to conduct tests, but we are hopeful that this situation will change soon. 'We are actively working with the BUAV, with whom we have a long term and constructive relationship, to influence the Chinese authorities to allow the alternative tests that apply elsewhere in the world.' Jean-Christophe Samyn, Director of Caudalie UK, said: 'We are against animal testing. We do not test our ingredients and formulas on animals and never will.' LEAPING BUNNY APPROVED . Paul Mitchell .

"Judd Trump showed some ominous form with three centuries as he beat Fraser Patrick 6-3 to reach the last 16 of the UK Championship at York's Barbican Centre. The Bristolian surged into a 4-0 interval lead and though his opponent came back into the game, he had enough of a cushion and was always comfortable. Trump made an 85 break in the first frame and when he made 129 and 130 in the next two, it looked like being a short afternoon's work. Judd Trump made a storming start against Fraser Patrick and raced into a 4-0 lead . Patrick was in first with 59 in frame four but could not close it out and Trump nicked it for a 4-0 lead. The interval came at a good time for Patrick and he got on the board with a 66 break and then closed further to 4-2. The players shared the next two frames with half-centuries before Trump wrapped up the game with his third century, a 104. Trump's attitude has often been criticised but this season he has won the Australian Goldfields Open, his first ranking tournament win for nearly two years, and reached the final of the recent Champion of Champions event in Coventry. Trump recorded three centuries as he made it safely through to the last 16 in York . He told BBC Two: 'I've put the work in a lot more than I have done in the past, probably 50 per cent more. 'That's just because of my lack of results in the last couple of seasons, I felt like I'd stood still and everyone else had moved on around me. 'When I'm really confident I don't practice that much because there's no point boring yourself. But after Australia I played five hours a day solid, phone off and just practice. 'I'm trying to concentrate on my snooker and forget going out and stuff like that.' Trump is reaping the rewards after putting in extra practice hours on the table . Meanwhile John Higgins produced a vintage showing to beat another former champion Matthew Stevens 6-2. The Scot made breaks of 59, 81, 62 - after Stevens was first in with 61 in frame four - to lead 3-1 at the interval. He then added a 128 and a 52 in a convincing win and put his improved form this week down to a new shorter cueing motion. He told BBC 2: 'We were out together, us Scottish boys, and there's no quarter given. Marcus Campbell told me 'I think I know what's wrong with you, Graeme (Dott) told me'. John Higgins put in a vintage display to beat Matthew Stevens 6-2 and next faces Anthony McGill . 'I've been trying it and it seems to be going okay. The last 18 months I've felt a little bit out of control with my game, I thought it's just old age, but I've felt a lot better the last two matches.' Higgins next faces Anthony McGill, who claimed a 6-5 comeback victory over Nigel Bond to progress. Bond incredibly came from 5-0 down to beat Barry Hawkins 6-5 on Saturday evening and runs of 54 and 90 gave him a 2-1 lead after McGill had opened with a 60. He extended it to 4-1 but McGill fought back to level 4-4 before taking the next two frames. David Morris followed up his stunning 6-4 win over Mark Selby by beating David Gilbert 6-2 with breaks of 60 and 65 and will face Stephen Maguire or Mark Williams.","Trump recorded three centuries on his way to 6-3 win at York's Barbican .

"Frank Lampard is to leave Manchester City at the end of the season and finally join his new club New York City in July. Despite Lampard’s excellent form for Manuel Pellegrini’s side, the midfielder has made it clear he wants to take up the challenge of playing in the MLS when his loan spell ends in England. There had been fears at New York City and within MLS that Lampard, 36, would be tempted to remain at the Etihad beyond the end of the season. Frank Lampard is tackled by Atdhe Nuhiu of Sheffield Wednesday during the FA Cup third round victory . Lampard was all smiles during the FA Cup clash - which he started .

But it’s understood the former England midfielder wants to honour his contract and move to America after City’s season comes to an end. Lampard, who played in City’s victory over Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday in the FA Cup, angered a section of his new club’s supporters when Manchester City extended his loan spell. MLS commissioner Don Garber accused Manchester City of an ‘error of judgement’ after they invited Lampard to train with them following Chelsea’s failure to offer him a new contract. Garber said: ‘I sensed this was coming, and it didn’t surprise me when they ultimately made their decision. You’re dealing with a very unusual set of circumstances. ‘Frank has become one of the most important players in Man City’s season, and he’s scored critical goals to have them tied for first place in the Premier League. Frank Lampard signed for New York City last summer before agreeing a loan move to Manchester City . ‘They were faced with a difficult decision. I’m going to be supportive of all our ownership groups, making them aware of my point of view. ‘But we need to work hard now to move forward and recognise that Frank will be joining this team in July along with other Designated Players, who throughout the history of the Designated Player programme have almost always joined in July. ‘If there was an error in judgment on this, it was not just announcing that he would come in July and figuring out how to manage the start of the season, no different than what happened with Robbie Keane or Thierry Henry or David Beckham.’","Frank Lampard is on loan at Manchester City from New York City .

"Gary Cahill's future at Chelsea is in jeopardy after it emerged that Jose Mourinho is planning to make major changes to his defence next season. Discussions have already taken place that could shift Branislav Ivanovic into his preferred position at centre back alongside captain John Terry as part of a defensive reshuffle. Cesar Azpilicueta has been earmarked for a role at right back, also his orthodox position, to finally find room for the £16m left back Filipe Luis in a modified back four. Chelsea centre-back Gary Cahill appears to have lost the faith of Blues boss Jose Mourinho . Although Mourinho insists Terry’s one-year contract extension at Stamford Bridge is ‘a formality’, there will eventually come a time when Chelsea must find a replacement. Real Madrid’s young centre back Raphael Varane is a longstanding target of Mourinho and Chelsea scouts are watching him as the Portuguese boss prepares to reconfigure his defence in the summer. Atletico Madrid’s Uruguayan defender Jose Gimenez and Athletic Bilbao centre half Aymeric Laporte are also being monitored. Mourinho wanted to bring Varane to Chelsea when he returned to Stamford Bridge in July 2013, but Real Madrid have refused to sell the 21-year-old France defender. Kurt Zouma (top), challenging James Milner on Saturday, has impressed playing alongside John Terry . Real Madrid centre back Raphael Varane (rght), is admired by former Bernabeu manager Mourinho . The Chelsea manager oversaw his progress at the Bernabeu and he is now a regular in the Real Madrid team alongside the experienced figure of Sergio Ramos. Jimenez, 20, is regarded as one of the finest young defenders in European football. Laporte, also 20, has won a place in the Bilbao team and is another youngster being watched by Chelsea. Despite Bilbao’s difficult season in La Liga, the France defender has also gained vital Champions League experience this term. Mourinho is showing a ruthless streak again and he is determined to make improvements to his defence at the end of the season. Cahill, next to former Blues favourite Frank Lampard, in action against Manchester City on Saturday . Cahill continued his formidable partnership with Terry in the opening four months of the season, but Mourinho has lost faith in the England defender. In the absence of Terry, who was rested against Bradford City in the FA Cup, Cahill was expected to take responsibility against Phil Parkinson’s team. But Chelsea were beaten 4-2 and he lost his place to Kurt Zouma for the Capital One Cup tie against Liverpool last Tuesday. On Saturday, in the 1-1 draw with Manchester City, he came on as an 87th-minute substitute and was asked to play in a holding midfield role to see the game out. Even then there was frustration from Mourinho on the sidelines when Cahill carelessly conceded possession to set up a City attack in the final moments of the game. Zouma has surprised Mourinho after his elevation to the first team, but the club are also wary of placing too much expectation on the young defender.","England defender has lost his place in the Chelsea side to Kurt Zouma .

"Outspoken: Father Gabriel Amorth said the 15-year-old was kidnapped for Vatican sex parties . The Catholic Church's leading exorcist priest has sensationally claimed a missing schoolgirl thought to be buried in a murdered gangster's tomb was kidnapped for Vatican sex parties. Father Gabriel Amorth, 85, who has carried out 70,000 exorcisms, spoke out as investigators continued to examine mobster Enrico De Pedis's tomb in their hunt for Emanuela Orlandi. Last week police and forensic experts broke into the grave after an anonymous phone call to a TV show said the truth about Emanuela's 1983 disappearance would be 'found there'. And although bones not belonging to the mobster were recovered they have not yet been positively identified as hers. However Father Amorth, in an interview with La Stampa newspaper, said: 'This was a crime with a sexual motive. 'It has already previously been stated by (deceased) monsignor Simeone Duca, an archivist at the Vatican, who was asked to recruit girls for parties with the help of the Vatican gendarmes. 'I believe Emanuela ended up in this circle. I have never believed in the international theory (overseas kidnappers). I have motives to believe that this was just a case of sexual exploitation. 'It led to the murder and then the hiding of her body. Also involved are diplomatic staff from a foreign embassy to the Holy See.' Today there was no immediate response from the Vatican to Father Amorth's claims. But Vatican officials insisted they had always co-operated with the investigation into Orlandi's disappearance - a claim that her brother has often disputed. Mobster: De Pedis (left) is believed to have been linked to the kidnapping and murder of Emanuela Orlandi (right), who disappeared aged 15 in 1983 . Father Amorth is a colourful figure who in the past has also denounced yoga and Harry Potter as the 'work of the Devil'. He was appointed by the late Pope John Paul II as the Vatican's chief exorcist. It is not the first time Father Amorth has raised eyebrows with his forthright views - two years ago he said sex scandals rocking the Catholic Church were evidence 'the Devil was at work in the Vatican.' In 2006, Father Amorth, who was ordained a priest in 1954, gave an interview to Vatican Radio in which he said Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and Russian dictator Josef Stalin were possessed by the Devil. According to secret Vatican documents recently released the then wartime Pope Pius XII attempted a 'long distance exorcism' of Hitler but it failed to have any effect. Claims: The 15-year-old was kidnapped for Vatican sex parties, it has been claimed . Charismatic mobster De Pedis, leader of a murderous gang known as the Banda della Magliana, was gunned down aged just 38, by members of his outfit after they fell out. Detectives investigating the disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi, 15, in 1983, believe De Pedis is linked to her kidnap and the body of the Vatican employee's daughter has never been found. Last month the diocese of Rome, on orders from the Vatican, granted investigators permission to open up the tomb in the Sant'Apollinare basilica close to Piazza Navona in the centre of Rome. At the time of his funeral there were raised eyebrows when despite his criminal past church chiefs allowed De Pedis to be buried in the crypt of Sant'Apollinare. At the time it was said the burial was given the go ahead because prison chaplain Father Vergari told bishops that De Pedis had 'repented while in jail and also done a lot of work for charity,' including large donations to the Catholic Church. A burial service truck enters the courtyard of Sant' Apollinare Basilica, in Rome, before the tomb of mobster Enrico De Pedis was opened . Police officers stand outside Sant' Apollinare Basilica, in Rome, as a priest leaves . De Pedis, whose name on the £12,000 tomb is spelt in diamonds, was buried in Sant'Apollinare church after he was gunned down in 1990 in the city's famous Campo De Fiori. He and his gang controlled the lucrative drug market in Rome and were also rumoured to have a 'free hand' because of their links with police and Italian secret service agents. The disappearance of Orlandi reads like the roller coaster plot of a Dan Brown Da Vinci Code thriller with a touch of The Godfather thrown in for good measure. Twelve years ago a skull was found in the confessional box of a Rome church and tests were carried out on it to see if it was Orlandi after a mystery tip off but they proved negative. In 2008 Sabrina Minardi, De Pedis girlfriend at the time of Orlandi's disappearance, sensationally claimed that now dead American monsignor Paul Marcinkus, the controversial chief of the Vatican bank, was behind the kidnap. Forensic police unload equipment in the courtyard of Sant' Apollinare Basilica, in Rome . Monsignor Marcinkus used his status to avoid being questioned by police in the early 1980's probing the collapse of a Banco Ambrosiano which the Vatican had invested heavily in. The collapse was linked to the murder of Roberto Calvi dubbed God's Banker because of the Vatican links and his body was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London in June 1982. His pockets filled with cash and stones and it was originally recorded as a suicide but police believe he was murdered by the Mafia after a bungled money laundering operation. At the same time as Minardi made her claim a mystery caller to a missing person’s programme on Italian TV said the riddle of Orlandi’s kidnap would be solved 'if De Pedis tomb was opened'. Following Minardi claims the Vatican took the unusual step of speaking publicly and dismissed her claims about American Monsignor Marcinkus, who died in Arizona four years ago.

"Darren Fletcher £75,000 a week move to West Ham is in jeopardy after he returned to Manchester United on Saturday after failing to agree to terms at Upton Park. Fletcher, 30, returned to Manchester this morning as West Ham consider their options ahead of his proposed move to Upton Park.

After his side beat Leicester 3-1 at Old Trafford on Saturday manager Louis van Gaal was at a loss to explain why the move has broken down and expects the Scot to remain at Manchester United. 'I think so (he will remain a man utd player). He is my third captain so it is not a problem for me. Manchester United just want to help him play more. For him now that is a big pity.' 'I don't know what is happening. When you allow your player to go to London for the medical, there is no problem. At the end there is no agreement, it is strange. 'We want to help Fletcher.

When Midnight collapsed on June 21, Pritchard contacted the RSPCA and the animal was rushed to a vet. Although she was given a saline drip to combat dehydration and to give her an energyboost, Midnight died from organ failure. Pritchard, from Bournemouth, Dorset, told an RSPCA inspector that she thought cats could take paracetamol after seeing her mother do it as a child. Claire Pritchard, from Bournemouth, Dorset, . told an RSPCA inspector that she thought cats could take paracetamol . after seeing her mother do it as a child . She was prosecuted by the RSPCA under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, and pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal, and for not catering to her needs. Graham Hammond, a spokesman for the . charity, said: 'A cat cannot digest paracetamol the same way a human can . because it doesn’t have the same enzyme that is required, so it just . packed up its internal organs. 'Mrs . Pritchard’s argument was that she thought that’s what you did with cats . because she had seen her mother do it as a child, but that could have . been a cat medicine. 'At . the time she didn’t know she had done wrong, but she didn’t take the cat . to the vets in the first place despite having other cats registered . with the PDSA.' Midnight was given a saline drip to combat dehydration and to give her an energy boost, but died of poisoning . Pritchard was given a two-year conditional discharge by magistrates in Bournemouth who did not impose a ban on her keeping animals. She was ordered to pay £280 in court costs. She today accused the RSPCA of persecuting her over Midnight's death. The grandmother said: 'I think generally the RSPCA do a great job but they will persecute and harass you if they think you have done wrong. 'I couldn't believe the RSPCA prosecuted me. When their guy came to take a statement from me I was shocked at the way he spoke to me.' She claims that Midnight may have died from an undiagnosed abscess rather than a drugs overdose. She said: 'I have had pets since I was a child and know how to look after them. I have been giving cats a little bit of paracetamol for years without any problems. 'The cat died in the care of the RSPCA care and experts have told me that they don't know if it was the paracetamol or the abscess.'

"For a split second Costa Rica manager Jorge Luis Pinto paused, arms mid air, and then erupted as his side were denied a stonewall penalty against Italy. Striker Joel Campbell had raced behind the Italian defence in the 43rd minute before being clumsily brought down by Giorgio Chiellini.Â .

"Former 'Saturday Night Live' cast member Victoria Jackson has filed to run as an independent candidate for a seat on a county commission outside Nashville, Tenn. Jackson calls herself a tea party conservative. Though she has spent her political life up until now as a registered Republican, she believes the party has lost its way. Scroll down for video . Second act: Former SNL star Victoria Jackson wants to run for a Tennessee county commission seat as a 'tea party conservative' Funny girl: Jackson was once better known as an SNL player working with comedy legends like Jane Curtin, Chevy Chase, Lorne Michaels, and Dana Carvey . Jackson, 54, told The Tennessean she filed as an independent candidate because she was 'very disappointed with the Republican Party.' 'But I just can’t do it anymore; they just don’t have the values of our founding fathers anymore,' she said. 'I am sure there are a few Republicans who do. I want less federal government involvement, lower taxes, smaller government, more public involvement, a balanced budget and fiscal responsibility.' As long as Jackson meets the candidate qualifying requirements by the Feb. 20 deadline, her name will be on the county general election ballot on Aug. 7. Should she make it that far, she'll run against the Republican nominee, who will be chosen in May. There are currently five Republicans who have gotten petitions for the District 2 seat Jackson is gunning for. The comedian's legal name is Victoria Lynn Jackson-Wessel, but she asked county officials if her name could appear on the ballot as simply Victoria Jackson because 'people thought it said weasel,' said deputy administrator Chad Gray. Controversy: No stranger to heated debate, Jackson has called television shows featuring gays 'sickening' and protested Muslim centers . Jackson promised not to be a traditional candidate if she qualifies for the ballot, relying on 'word of mouth' rather than actively fundraising, and possibly buying campaign stickers and shirts with her own money. Though once known for her parts in popular skits like 'Toonces the Driving Cat' and appearances on Weekend Update, in more recent years Jackson has been in the public eye as an outspoken Tea Party activist and conservative Christian. In 2011 she sparked controversy when she blasted television show Glee for airing a same-sex kiss between two male actors, calling the program 'sickening' and 'a mockery of Christians.' Golden years: Seen here with fellow SNL alum Jon Lovitz, Jackson was known for her squeaky-voiced late night persona . 'I think the key to saving America is normal everyday citizens getting involved because we the people are supposed to be in control, not the government,' Jackson said. 'I had a political awakening in 2007. I'm tired of complaining. I want to do something.' Upon arriving in Tennessee, Jackson continued to speak out against cultures and lifestyles she believes threaten the country, including protesting a public discussion hosted by the American Muslim Advisory Council and working to stop a mosque from opening in Murfreesboro. Jackson moved to Tennessee last year . with husband Paul Wessel, a retired helicopter pilot with 35 years . experience with the Miami Police Department. 'I think I will fit in quite easily with (the current county commission),' she said. 'I went to the dentist recently and there was a Bible in the lobby of the dentist office...I love this town. My two favorite things are here - Jesus and show business.'","Jackson appeared on SNL from 1986 to 1992 in classic sketches including 'Toonces the Driving Cat' and 'The Church Lady'

"American gymnast Aly Raisman has revealed the music for her gold medal-winning floor routine at the London Olympics was a tribute to the victims of the 1972 Munich Games terror attack. The 18-year-old said choosing Hava Nagila- a traditional score used for wedding dances and bat mitzvah - was a response to the International Olympic Committee's failure to mark the 40th anniversary of the tragedy. And for Aly, from Needham, Massachusetts,  she said it made her gold even more special. 'I can only imagine how painful it must be for the families and close personal friends of the victims,' she said. Scroll down for video . Munich tribute: Gold medalist Aly Raisman poses on the podium during the medal ceremony for the floor exercise . 'I am Jewish, that's why I wanted that floor music,' she told the New York Post.

That was really cool and . fun to hear the audience clapping.' Eleven Israeli athletes were killed during the 1972 Munich Olympic Games in the now infamous Palestinian terrorist attack. Only recently it has been revealed German neo-Nazis helped them.

President Obama also threw his support behind the call for a commemoration of the massacre at the London . Olympics. NBC's . Bob Costas also blasted the decision, saying it was 'insensitive' and . held his own moment of silence when Israeli . athletes marched into the Olympic Stadium.

Aly was shocked when the judges announced her winning score of . 15.600 points that made her the first American woman to strike gold in the Olympic floor exercise. 'That was the best floor performance I've ever done, and to do it for the Olympics is like a dream,' Aly said. Rabbi Keith Stern, spiritual leader of Temple Beth Avodah in Newton . Centre, Massachusetts, where the Raisman family are members, said: 'She is a focused person. Remember: During the 1972 Munich Games, a group of Palestinian terrorist kidnapped and killed much of the Israeli team in a highly-publicized ordeal . Terror: Eleven were killed by the Palestinian Black September group . It began on the morning of September 5, 1972, with six days left in the Games, when eight terrorists stormed the Olympic village and raided the Israeli contingent’s apartment. Two Israeli athletes were killed and nine more were seized as hostages. They demanded the release of over 200 Palestinians serving time in Israeli jails, along with two renowned German terrorists. After a day of unsuccessful negotiations, the terrorists collected the hostages and headed for the military airport in Munich for a flight back to the Middle East. At the airport, German sharpshooters opened fire, killing three of the Palestinians. A horrifying gun battle ensued, claiming the lives of all nine of the hostages and two terrorists on board a helicopter. The three surviving assassins were captured, but later released by West Germany following the hijacking a Lufthansa airliner by the Black September group. 'She's very proud and upfront . about being Jewish. Neither she nor her family explicitly sought to send . a message. But it shows how very integrated her Jewish heritage is in . everything that she does.' Rabbi Stern told the New York Post that he was also stunned by the IOC's refusal to hold a moment of silence during the event. 'I'm happy to hear any other . explanation,' he said. 'But short of some racist grudge somebody is . holding, I can't figure out why it would be a terrible thing to do.' The Rabbi said he watched the routine . and was blown away. 'I have to say, the statement just warmed me to the very depths of my being,' he said. He compared it to the iconic . black-power, raised-fist protest made by track stars John Carlos and . Tommie Smith on the medal stand at the 1968 Mexico City Games. 'They're not going to forget that,' the rabbi said. 'I certainly won't.' Eventually, a low-key tribute in front of 100 people was paid at the signing of the Olympic Truce in London's Olympic Village after the Games opened, the first time it has happened inside an athletes village. This was not the first time the IOC passed over a moment of silence. In . the 2002 Olympics held in Salt Lake City - and largely organised by .

"There appeared to be nothing out of the ordinary in the parking lot of this Virginia Beach apartment complex - until a speeding fighter jet dropped out of the sky and crashed there in a fiery wreck. Part of the dramatic April 6 crash were captured by a security camera that was rotating just yards away from where the Navy F-18 slammed to earth. The two-seater F-18 jet crashed into the Mayfield . Mews apartment complex, about a mile from the Atlantic Ocean,, after suffering a 'catastrophic . mechanical malfunction' during a training flight. Scroll down for video . Streak: The fighter jet can be seen as a blur before crashing into the apartment complex . Visibility: The jet is moving so fast that it can only be seen in two frames of the video - and even then, it's just a blur . Before and after: As the camera panned back to the apartment, the building that was one standing is now leveled by the crash . In a true 'blink or you'll miss it' moment, the camera slowly pans in the parking lot of the complex before the aircraft quickly streaks across the screen. The jet is moving so fast that it can only be seen in two frames of the video. And even in those two frames, it is just a blur. While the camera was not fixed on the building at the time of the crash, the moment of impact can be seen in a reflection on a car door, glowing bright orange as flames erupt from the downed jet. As the tape continues rolling, a driver appears not to notice what had just happened as he calmly exits the parking lot. Response: Moments after the crash, police and firefighters can be seen arriving at the scene . Flames: Callers flooded 911 following the sudden impact of the jet into the apartment complex in Virginia Beach . Inferno: Though the pilots expelled most of the fuel before crashing, the fuselage caught ablaze as people called for help .

"Lazio have opened talks over a bid to sign Ravel Morrison from West Ham. Morrison has been told he can leave for free this month, even though he has a reputed £18million buyout clause in his contract. Lazio delegates have been in London for business meetings and have been alerted to Morrison’s situation following his return from an inauspicious loan at Cardiff. Lazio have started talks with West Ham over signing midfielder Ravel Morrison (centre right) this January . A move to Italy would have to wait until the summer though as Morrison has played in two countries - England and Wales - this season and FIFA don't allow a third. If he gets his contract cancelled he could sign a short-term deal with another English club and Lazio could pick up again at the end of the season. If West Ham insist on keeping registration they can pay a fee in summer. West Ham are asking for a percentage of any sell-on and there is interest from other clubs also. As manager Sam Allardyce prepares his side for Tuesday’s FA Cup replay with Everton, he has said that exiled forward Morrison will one day regret not taking his advice on how to fulfil his potential at West Ham. Morrison has no future at the club and he has been forced to train with the Under 21s since his return from a disappointing loan spell at Cardiff last month. In his latest row at West Ham, Morrison is in dispute with the club for not receiving his full £60,000 wages for December, after being fined for misconduct, and has called in the Professional Footballers’ Association to help. Ravel Morrison returned early from his loan with Cardiff City (left) and has been told he can quit West Ham . Allardyce said: ‘Most young talented players I worked with over many, many years who I’ve met later have said, “Oh, I wish I’d listened to you”. ‘When you meet them later in life they regret not taking the opportunity with the talent they had. It’s never just about talent, it’s about a lot more than that. ‘You can lead the horse to water but you can’t make it drink. There’s only a certain amount of times you can tell somebody what they should or shouldn’t be doing. If they don’t want to take it on board there’s little you can do. ‘It’s very difficult to sit and watch such a great talent wasted. In Ravel’s position, the talent is there, he just has to change his whole life and then hopefully somewhere down the line he’ll become the player he should be.’ Morrison has been told to look for another club but the player does not want to leave until he has settled this dispute. West Ham insist they have followed internal disciplinary procedures. 21-year-old (left) has been forced to train with the Under 21s since his return from a loan spell with Cardiff . Allardyce added: ‘Rav didn’t perform at Cardiff. If he’d have done the business there he could have created a much more healthy position for himself either back here or somewhere else, but he was on the fringes of the team.’ Meanwhile, Leighton Baines has explained how crucial the FA Cup is to Everton’s season. ‘We are not seeing the FA Cup as a distraction,’ said the left back. ‘Being in the cups gives you hope and optimism for the second half of the season. ‘It is important we pick up our league form and get back up the table but, realistically, optimism is going to come from the cups. ‘If we go to West Ham and get a good win, it changes everything.’ Morrison looks dejected after West Ham slumped to a 5-0 defeat against Nottingham Forest in January 2014 .

"Tragedy: Student Archie Wellbelove, 18, (pictured) was killed when a taxi hit him on a stretch of road where the street lights were switched off to save money . A cost-cutting council ‘contributed’ to the death of a university student by switching off its street lights, a coroner has said. Archie Wellbelove was hit by a taxi five days after Warwickshire Council switched off selected lights across the county in a bid to save £500,000 a year. Road safety campaigners have long warned of the dangers of unlit streets – as councils across Britain continue to dim or turn off their lights completely to save money and meet climate change targets. Warwickshire Council has even admitted that by doing this, safety will inevitably be compromised. Mr Wellbelove, who was in his first year at Warwick University, was killed on the A452 near Leamington in the early hours of December 7, 2012, on his way home from a night out. The taxi driver said he was unable to see the 18-year-old because the road was too dark, adding that it was the first time he noticed the street lights were switched off. Coroner Dr Richard Brittain recorded a narrative conclusion following the inquest at Warwickshire Justice Centre on Friday, but forced the county council into an early review of its street lighting policy on that stretch of road. A county-wide review was due next July, and a review of that stretch was taken following Mr Wellbelove’s death, but Dr Brittain said: ‘I do not believe the specifics of this case have been reviewed by those who have the power to do so sufficiently and I feel a delay until July is unacceptable. 'I think a review will be helpful and I will be issuing a report to prevent future deaths.’ Graham Fitton, head of transport and highways at the county council, confirmed that lights on that stretch of road are left on later on Friday and Saturday nights following the death, but insisted the lights policy and the speed limit on the street were appropriate. Asked about the lights switch-off in general, he said: ‘If I have to save £500,000 then whatever I do will always have an impact on safety in some way.’ Scene: Archie was killed when the car struck him on the A452 near Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, (pictured) in the early hours of December 7 last year . Tribute: The 18-year-old (pictured) was in his first year at Warwick University studying English and French and his family spoke of a much-loved and talented young man at his inquest . Mr Wellbelove, who was studying English and French and played rugby . at county level, was described by his family as ‘beautiful, intelligent . and very witty’. Experts: Police said today that the taxi driver who hit Archie would have had less than two seconds to react because of the darkness . Taxi driver Mour Ali, who cried in court, . recalled how he didn’t see the student or know what he’d hit after . hearing a loud bang. Mr Ali, who has driven a taxi in the area for 13 . years, said: ‘I was used to the road being lit, that was the first time I . noticed they switched the lights off. It was very dark. ‘I wasn’t . speeding, I was just going along and suddenly – bang. I think about it . every morning, all the time. I have my own kid – he was just a kid.’ It . took more than 45 minutes for emergency services to find Mr . Wellbelove’s body which was discovered only after the street lights were . switched back on. Investigators from Warwickshire Police concluded that . he was walking in the road with his back to traffic before he was hit. They also found that in the poor lighting conditions, Mr Ali wouldn’t . have been able to react in time even if he had seen Mr Wellbelove. PC . Dean Male said it would have been a ‘benefit’ if the streets lights had . been left on. He said: ‘At 40mph, the driver would have literally had . two seconds to have seen the pedestrian and reacted.’ The court . heard how Mr Wellbelove was three and half times over the drink-drive . limit when he decided to walk nine miles home from Evolve nightclub in . Leamington towards his hall of residence on the campus in Coventry.Dr . Brittain concluded: ‘Archie died from injuries which resulted from a . road traffic collision. 'Multiple factors taken together contributed to . the collision including the lack of street lighting, Archie’s dark . clothing, his direction of travel and his position in the road. 'On the . balance of evidence it’s not possible to isolate anything specific.’ After . the inquest Mr Wellbelove’s mother Katie, from Biggleswade in . Bedfordshire, said: ‘We are very happy with the verdict and that the . light situation will be looked at. It was certainly a contributing . factor.’","Archie Wellbelove, 18, was killed when a taxi hit him on December 7 last year .

"In Burlington, Vermont, there seems to be an 18 percent surcharge for speaking French. Some waiters in the New England tourist town have begun adding a mandatory tip onto the bill of foreign diners. Restaurant owners say it's their solution to an influx of French-speaking Canadians from Quebec who are extraordinarily bad tippers -- sometimes leaving just $1 or a few cents tip on $50 or $100 tabs. Discrimination? Splash at the Boathouse is one of the restaurants in Burlington, Vermont, where servers add a mandatory 18 percent tip to French-speaking diners' tabs . At least one Vermont resident, who grew up in France, says the new rules are discrimination and they might be illegal. She has been slapped with an automatic 18 percent gratuity three times because she often speaks French to her friends during dinner. Restaurant owners say there's no policy in place to include mandatory tip on diners from Canada and other countries. They claim they have left the decision up to individual waiters and waitresses. However, the practice is so common, servers refer to it as the 'Queeb tax' -- after the Quebecois who inspired it, Seven Days, a Vermont news site, reports. The Asiana Noodle Shop is one restaurant where foreigners are likely to be hit with an 18 percent gratuity included on their bill . Owner Sandy Kong told ABC News that she was tired of her waitresses getting bad tips. 'Some Canadians come in, they spend like $100 or $150 and they leave the wait staff maybe a $1 tip,' she said. 'It happens pretty often. I realize that the Canadians think it's discrimination, but on all the receipts it's printed out on bottom: ""We suggest an 18 or 20 percent tip.""' Visitors: The city of Burlington has been encouraging tourists from Quebec to visit Vermont and spend their money . Ms Kong, who was born in Hong Kong, said other foreigners are often lousy at leaving money for the wait staff. 'Asians do it also. But it seems that Canadians tip the worst,' she said. Anne-Marie Humbert, who lives in a nearby town in Vermont, first noticed the practice when she had dinner with her husband at Splash at the Boat House on Burlington. The two spent their dinner speaking French to each mother. Ms Humbert was born and raised in France, but has lived in the United States for 30 years. When the bill came, it looked too steep, until she realized the waitress had included an 18 percent tip on top of the total for the meal. Ms Humbert protested and the server removed the surcharge. Ms Humbert says she left a 15 percent tip. The policies are discrimination, Ms Humbert says, because waiters are targeting anyone who they assume isn't American. The problem likely arises from a cultural difference. In Canada and most countries, tipping 10 to 15 percent is customary, though many restaurants automatically include a gratuity on the bill. Waiters in Vermont make just $4.10 an hour without tips.","Burlington, Vermont, has had an influx of French Canadians from Quebec ."
"Offended: Howard Blake was told to send a demo when he offered to help on the sequel to The Snowman . As the man behind the haunting theme to The Snowman, Howard Blake thought he was well qualified to help out on the sequel. After all, his original score – Walking In The Air – has sold over a million copies and has become synonymous with Christmas. The composer, however, found his pride well and truly dented when he offered his services and was told to submit a demo tape for consideration. Yesterday Mr Blake said the only song he had so far heard from the sequel, The Snowman and The Snowdog, sounded like ‘X Factor style pop’ which he feared would upset fans of the first film. He said: ‘There are some people who watch The Snowman every year with their whole family, so to them it is something almost sacred. 'It’s an icon that is part of the entire English Christmas. It really holds a very dear place in people’s hearts.’ He’s particularly upset the follow up does not feature the original theme. He said: ‘I don’t think it can be a proper sequel without some version of Walking in the Air. It could be sung by a different voice, it could be updated. But it’s so much part of The Snowman that people will be expecting it.’ Mr Blake, 74, wrote Walking in the Air in 1970 on a beach in Cornwall after escaping from London where the pressures of a massive workload had driven him to a near breakdown. It wasn’t until over a decade later when he was shown plans for the film of The Snowman that he realised he had the perfect musical accompaniment. In the 1982 film, based on the book by Raymond Briggs, the song plays as the boy and snowman glide over the countryside. Follow-up: A scene from The Snowman and The Snowdog. Mr Blake said it would not be a proper sequel unless it had some version of Walking in the Air in it . In the sequel, the snowdog joins them as they fly across London before heading for the North Pole, over a new soundtrack written and recorded by former Razorlight drummer Andy Burrows and British composer Ilan Eshkeri. Mr Blake, who first made his name in the sixties writing scores for TV shows, said that after being belatedly told about the new film his assistant approached the show’s producer, Camilla Deakin, to ask if she wanted him to write any music for it. He added: ‘She said if you care to submit a demo, we’re asking anyone who can write music to send in demos for our consideration. It’s unbelievable. Fears: Mr Blake that the only song he had heard from the sequel sounded like X Factor style pop . Original: Walking in the Air which featured in The Snowman (pictured) was originally sung by St Paul's choirboy Peter Auty . ‘I wrote a polite letter saying I don’t do demos but if you would like me to come and look at the script you are proposing I could let you know if I might be interested in composing a score for it. I never had a reply. That is extremely offensive.’ Walking in the Air was originally sung by St Paul’s choirboy Peter Auty. A version sung by Welsh chorister Aled Jones released three years later reached Number 5 in the charts. The new film will air on Channel 4 over Christmas. A spokesman for the broadcaster said: ‘The Snowman and The Snowdog is a brand new sequel with an original storyline and new soundtrack. ‘John Coates, who died earlier this year, produced the original film and was instrumental in getting Raymond Briggs’ blessing and bringing The Snowman and The Snowdog to screen.’","Howard Blake said one song from the sequel sounded like X Factor style pop .

"Pauline Kinghorn, 62, received a lifetime ban for her poor treatment of the animals . A woman has been banned from keeping animals for life after her dogs' coats were left in such an appalling condition, they could hardly walk or see. Pauline Kinghorn's three shih-tzus were barely recognisable as dogs, as their fur was so long and matted with food and faeces. They were forced to drag themselves along the floor using their front legs due to the mass of hair. An RSPCA officer finally rescued the dogs from Kinghorn's filth-laden home in Linton Colliery, Northumberland. An experienced vet and expert dog groomer said their overgrown and unkempt coats were in the worst condition of neglect she had ever seen. Bedlington Magistrates Court heard how the three shih-tzus had been neglected for five or six months, and that an elderly German Shepherd dog also found at Kinghorn's home had to be put down as it was in such poor health. RSPCA Inspector Trevor Walker said: 'I have worked for the RSPCA for more than 15 years and during that time I have witnessed some pretty horrific things. 'However, I can honestly say that I've never seen such a deeply depressing sight as these three shih-tzu dogs. 'I can only describe them as dog-like, because there were no discernible points of the mouth, nose, or eyes through the mass or fur and dreadlocks.' Kinghorn, 63, was yesterday handed a lifetime disqualification from keeping animals. Scroll down for video . Overgrown: Horrifying photo shows Angus as he was when rescued.

She was previously banned from owning cats for five years in 2003. She admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the three shih-tzus and the German Shepherd between October last year and April this year. She also admitted four charges of failing to ensure the welfare of the four dogs and 12 cats in her care. As they should have been: The two dogs, pictured when their hair was short . The court was told the animals were found living in the ‘most appalling and unimaginable' conditions. Paul Watson, defending, said Kinghorn had health problems, including visual impairment caused by dense cataracts and had no-one to help her look after the animals. He said: 'This is not a case of deliberate cruelty, but one of neglect. 'She didn't know where to turn for assistance.' Kinghorn was also ordered to pay £250 towards the RSPCA costs and the magistrates ordered the transfer of all of her animals to the charity. VIDEO: Neglected dogs unable to see or walk.

"A pregnant woman has been stoned to death by her own family in front of a Pakistani high court - for marrying the man she loved. Nearly 20 members of the woman's family, including her father and brothers, attacked her and her husband with batons and bricks in broad daylight. Farzana Parveen, who was three months pregnant, was killed before a crowd of onlookers in front of the high court of Lahore, police have reported. Scroll down for video . Farzana Parveen, 25, who was three months pregnant, was killed by nearly 20 members of the woman's family, including her father and brothers in Lahore on Tuesday . Police official Naseem Butt said the 25-year-old had married Mohammad Iqbal, with whom she had been engaged for years against the will of her family. Her father had filed an abduction case against her husband, which the couple was contesting, her lawyer Mustafa Kharal said. Arranged marriages are considered normal among conservative Pakistanis, who view marriage for love as a transgression. Hundreds of women are killed every year in Muslim-majority Pakistan in so-called 'honour killings' carried out by husbands or relatives as a punishment for alleged adultery or other illicit sexual behavior. Kharal said Parveen's relatives waited outside the court, which is located on a main downtown thoroughfare. As the couple walked up to the court's main gate, the family members fired shots in the air and tried to snatch her from Iqbal, he said. When she . resisted, her father, brothers and other relatives started beating her, . eventually pelting her with bricks from a nearby construction site, . Iqbal said. Iqbal, 45, said he started seeing Parveen after the death of his first wife, with whom he had five children. 'We were in love,' he told reporters. The body of Farzana Parveen, who was killed by family members, lies on the ground at the site near the Lahore High Court building . He alleged that the woman's family wanted to fleece money from him before marrying her off. 'I simply took her to court and registered a marriage,' he said. Butt, the police official, said Parveen's father surrendered after the incident and called the murder an 'honor killing.' Shock: Mohammad Iqbal sits next to his wife Farzana's body. He told reporters that they had been in love but her family did not agree with their marriage . Plot: He alleged that the woman's family wanted to fleece money from him before marrying her off . One of Ms Parveen's in-laws wails over her dead body after the attack in Lahore, Pakistan . The Human . Rights Commission of Pakistan, a private organisation, said in a report . last month that some 869 women were murdered in so-called honour . killings in 2013. But . the Pakistani rights group, The  Aurat Foundation, has said the figure . could be closer to a thousand and some estimate the true number could be . higher still. Campaigners say few cases come to court, and those that do can take years to be heard. Even . those that do result in a conviction may end with the killers walking . free. Pakistani law allows a victim's family to forgive their killer. But in honour killings, most of the time the women's killers are her family, said Wasim Wagha of the Aurat Foundation. The law allows them to nominate someone to do the murder, then forgive him. 'This is a huge flaw in the law,' he said. 'We are really struggling on this issue.'","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Mohammad Reza Domiri Ganji may have just found his true calling: capturing the little-seen breathtaking beauty of Iran's most dazzling mosques. The 24-year-old physics student, who lives in Babol in Iran's Mazandaran province, pursues his passion for photography on the side. Having no formal training whatsoever, Ganji has honed his eye by reading articles and watching Internet tutorial videos, and has a particular affinity for photographing historical architecture. Mohammad Reza Domiri Ganji captures the little-seen beauty of Iran's most stunning mosques. Pictured: the Pink Mosque in Shiraz . Experimenting with panorama, monument, and landscape photography, Ganji embarked on a project to photograph Muslim places of worship around Iran from unexpected viewpoints over five years ago. He was inspired after seeing some shots taken from the interior of the Egyptian pyramids online and began to wonder if he too could take pictures of significant historical sites. From the kaleidoscope-like patterns of the famous Nasīr al-Mulk Mosque (also known as the Pink Mosque) in Shiraz to documenting the intricate ceiling detailing of the Seyyed Mosque in Isfahan, Ganji has travelled to the far reaches of Iran to show foreigners a side of the country rarely seen. Making the project all the more fascinating is the fact that, while many of these mosques allow for tourists to snap quick photos, most do not allow professional photography equipment through the doors. This 'little planet view' captures the intricate detailing on the ceiling of the Vakil Mosque, also in Shiraz . 'To take professional photos, especially using a tripod, you require permits for most of these locations,' Ganji told MailOnline Travel. 'I go through the paperwork process to obtain a permit a few days before my trip. 'It’s not an easy process and there has been times when even with a permit, I didn’t receive the appropriate reception from the people in charge.' According to his website, Ganji's believes that the most important element in photography is light, a fact made evident in the images below as he often plays with shadow and streaming sunlight when framing his shots. Ganji also enjoys photographing popular tourist attractions, such as this historical bath located in Isfahan, south of Tehran . Ganji photographed the plaster ceiling of the music room in Ali Qapu Palace, located in Naqsh-e Jahan Square in Isfahan City . 'Normally mornings are the best times for photography in any respect,' he told us. 'Specifically, for the lighting and [because] it's less crowded.' Ganji normally uses wide and fish-eye lenses to capture his stunning panoramic shots. 'Wide lenses provide a larger angle, while panoramic photography offers an even wider angle when joining photographs together,' he said. 'It allows me to show all of the area in one image. Many of my pictures are a combination of more than three images.' But no matter your lens of choice, Ganji's most important piece of advice? 'Always try to find the distinguishing elements of the place that you're going to photograph,' he told MailOnline. 'Imagine your final result before staring your panoramic shoot.' This traditional carpet repair workshop is located near the entrance of the Vakil Mosque and Vakil Bazaar, in Shiraz . This is the stunning ceiling of the Chehel Sotoun Palace (or the Palace of Forty Columns), built by Shah Abbas II, in Isfahan . For those who wish to see the grandeur for themselves, tourism to Iran has tripled in the past year, thanks to improved relations with the West and Iran's newly-introduced measures to facilitate foreign tourists. The Director of Iran’s Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization (CHTHO), Masoud Soltanifar, said: 'Tourist trips to Iran are very attractive, important and cheap for foreigners while at the same time the country enjoys a high level of political and security stability. 'A two-week tourist visa is issued for the nationals of 190 countries at Iranian ports and airports.' Though the Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential travel, it's expected that the agency will relax their advisories, especially when it comes to visiting major city centres, like Tehran. Ganji hopes to continue photographing places of historical significance at other well-known Christian and Jewish monuments around the world and will post them on both hisFacebook page and website. Another shot of the finer details of the Ali Qapu Palace ceiling . One of Ganji's favourite places to photograph is the famed Pink Mosque, however, tourists usually block him from getting such stunning shots .

Also in the Naqsh-e Jahan Square in Isfahan is the Sheikh Lutfollah Mosque, which was completed in 1619 . Dolat Abad, which was built in 1750, is renowned for its intricate latticework and exquisite stained glass windows . The ceiling of the Dolat Abad, a small pavilion set amid UNESCO-listed gardens, is nothing short of breathtaking . Ganji believes that light is the most important element when it comes to capturing a stunning photo. Pictured: Emamzadeh-Hasan . Tehran's Azadi Tower (also known as the Liberty Tower) is one of its most notable structures, also marking the west entrance to the city . One of the most popular historical sites in Yazd, the blue and rose-hued Yazd Grand Mosque is still in use . The interior of the Dolat Abad pavilion is a maze of doors and windows, illuminated by the streaming sunshine . In Joffa, the Kordasht Bath is situated on the southern banks of the Aras River, and hosts thousands of visitors each year . Ganji captured a rare bottom-up view of the Jameh Mosque ceilings in Yazd.

"The young prisoner stood motionless in the office of the factory manager. Next to him stood the chief foreman and the floor foreman, who had reported him for his grave offence. ‘What were you thinking!?’ the manager screamed. ‘Do you want to die?’ Of course, he did not want to die — he was just 22 years old — but he knew, after many years in the brutal hell of North Korea’s Camp 14, that life was very cheap. Scroll down for video . Behind the wire: Rare video footage taken by hidden camera in 2005 and shows what appears to be a executions in a North Korean concentration camp near Hoeryang along the Chinese border (File photo) His ‘offence’ was severe indeed: he had accidentally dropped a sewing machine down a stairwell, and it was beyond repair. ‘Even if you die, the sewing machine can’t be brought back,’ the manager shouted. ‘Your hand is the problem!’ The chief foreman took hold of his right hand and, with a large kitchen knife, cut off the prisoner’s middle finger, just above the first knuckle. Incredibly, the prisoner felt that he’d got off lightly. ‘I thought my whole hand was going to be cut off at the wrist,’ he said, ‘so I felt thankful and grateful.’ Shin Dong-hyuk’s story of how he lost his finger is just one of the many horrors being recounted this week at a United Nations commission of inquiry in Seoul, South Korea. The commission are interviewing some 30 defectors who are fortunate enough to have slipped from the grasp of one of the vilest regimes the world has ever seen. Death: In tapes taken in 2005 that South Korean intelligence officers insist are fake, prisoners including children are kept in concentration camps that bear similarities to Shin Dong-hyuk's Camp 14 (File photo) Mr Shin, who testified on Monday, is one of the more well-known defectors. He has recently published an account of his experiences in a book, Escape From Camp 14. At times, the stories told by Mr Shin and his fellow defectors are almost too unbearable to hear — but it is the intention of the commission to publicise such acts of terror committed by the regime. It is hoped news of them will trickle across the border into North Korea, alerting its benighted people to what has been done in their name since the despotic Kim family took control in 1948. The 30 witnesses are just a handful of the hundreds of thousands of political prisoners incarcerated in a network of North Korean ‘kwan-li-so’ — best translated as ‘political penal-labour colonies’. In these colonies, three generations of families are held for life, often on the basis that a single family member was once deemed guilty of an offence against the regime. The supposed ‘crime’ which saw . Mr Shin born at Camp 14 in 1982 was that his two uncles had tried to flee the country in the mid-Sixties. Mr Shin’s parents were both prisoners, and their marriage had been arranged in the camp. If their baby had been born out of what passes for ‘wedlock’, then he would not have been allowed to live and they would have been executed for having ‘sexual contact without prior approval’. Evil: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, son of former leader Kim Jong-il, presides over one of the most repressive regimes in history . Another defector, Jee Heon-a, told the commission how one mother was forced to kill her own baby by holding it down in a bowl of water. ‘The mother begged the guard to spare her, but he kept beating her,’ Ms Jee said. ‘So the mother, her hands shaking, put the baby face down in the water. The crying stopped and a bubble rose up as it died. A grandmother who had delivered the baby quietly took it out.’ Mr Shin testified that his first memory as a toddler was watching a public execution, and that he had seen two or three per year since. Many of those executed are those caught trying to escape. One former prisoner, Kang Chol-Hwan, in his book The Aquariums Of Pyongyang, has recalled a typical execution at Camp 15  in which the condemned man had his mouth stuffed full of stones to stop him shouting out any statements against the regime that might be heard by the onlookers. The man was then bound with three pieces of rope: one around his eyes, one around his chest and one at the waist. The leader of the firing squad then shouted: ‘Aim at the traitor of the Fatherland… Fire!’ Three volleys were aimed at the man. The first hit him in the head, killing him instantly. The second hit him in the chest, causing him to slump, and the third, aimed at the waist, caused the man to fall into a pit. As Mr Kang wryly points out: ‘This simplified the burial.’ Spy state: The UN commission of inquiry will look into government policing activities in North Korea . Prisoners are sometimes made to throw rocks at the corpse until its skin comes off. Mr Kang also remembers how a bulldozer preparing some ground to be made into a field unearthed masses of body parts. ‘Scraps of human flesh re-emerged from the final resting place,’ he recalls. ‘Arms and legs and feet, some still stockinged, rolled in waves before the bulldozer. I was terrified. One of my friends vomited.’ Mr Kang was then made to throw the body parts into a ditch. ‘That scene frightens me even more today than it did back then,’ he says. In some ways, those who die are the lucky ones and many prisoners do indeed choose suicide as the ultimate means of escape. Just as in the Nazi concentration camps decades before, prisoners are worked incredibly hard and subsist on pathetically meagre rations. As a result, the starving prisoners — many of them children, — eat what they can, including rats, frogs, snakes, and insects. Mr Shin recalled how rats were especially valued, as their meat can help stave off a potentially fatal disease called pellagra, caused by a lack of protein and niacin. Isolation: A satellite image shows a camp in Haengyong, North Korea, where prisoners are thought to be held by the tyrannical government . Mr Shin would peel away the skin of a rat, scrape out its innards, chew the flesh and bones, then finish off with the rodents’ small feet. Mr Kang prized salamanders, but they have to be eaten live. ‘The way to eat a salamander is to grab it by its tail and swallow it in one gulp, before it can discharge a foul-tasting liquid,’ he says. In the camps, the children eat anything that moves, including earthworms. If a group of prisoners is sent to work in a field, not one animal is left alive. Not surprisingly, the penalty for stealing food is severe. At Camp 14, one six-year-old girl was found by her teacher to have five kernels of corn in her pockets. The teacher forced the young girl to kneel in front of the class, whereupon he repeatedly beat her around the head with a wooden stick. The class was forced to watch as her head swelled up with bruises, and blood leaked from her nose. Eventually, she was taken away. She died later that evening. Such treatment is by no means unusual, and torture is common. Beatings on especially vulnerable parts of the body such as the face and hands are particularly favoured by the sadistic guards, who are encouraged to regard the prisoners as subhuman. Victims are made to kneel motionless on concrete floors for hours, or crouch in special punishment boxes for 15 days at a time. Prison state: A female North Korean soldier stands guard at the entrance of a women's jail on the banks of the Yalu River near North Korea's Chongsong county . More awfully still, those being tortured have often been denounced by members of their own families. One of the most gut-wrenching pieces of testimony made by Mr Shin is his honest admission that it was he who betrayed his own mother and brother for plotting to escape from the camp. He was motivated by the fact that his mother had given rice to his brother and not to him, and partly because he knew that if they did escape, he too would be punished  and in all likelihood shot. Mr Shin was forced to watch their execution. At the time, he was so desensitised and full of hate that he felt they deserved their fate. When his mother was led out, he noticed her head was swollen from being beaten. As the noose went around her neck, she looked for her son but Mr Shin did not meet her eye. Her death was terrible, as she struggled at the end of the rope. His brother’s death was equally horrific, as bullets splattered his brains everywhere. The methods of execution varied according to the whim of the camp’s commandant. In 2004, Mr Shin managed to escape Camp 14 and eventually the country disguised as a soldier. Callous: Kim Jong-un lives a fantasy life on the one hand, while allowing the torture and oppression of his people on the other . Although his story and those of . others who have been testifying in Seoul this week seem exceptionally . brutal to our ears, they are commonplace in North Korean camps. Meanwhile, . the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, continues to live in a kind of . Never-Never Land, divorced from the sufferings of his people. His latest pet project is to build a ski resort, which he claims will be for the use of all. Just this week, though, the Swiss government blocked a deal to sell Kim any ski lifts, as it is inconceivable that the resort will be used by the public. And worthy though the UN commission is, it seems unlikely to stop the daily hell that is North Korea.","UN commission of inquiry in Seoul interviewing 30 defectors .

"A seven-year-old boy has become the youngest child in Britain to gain the top grade in any GCSE exam after his mother snapped up a study aid book for 5p at a charity shop. Thomas Barnes secured an A* grade in maths this summer to beat the previous record. The home-schooled boy, from Leigh in Lancashire, was awarded the grade in maths after taking an exam with students more than twice his age. Seven-year-old Thomas Barnes is  the youngest student to secure the top grade in any GCSE exam . Thomas, who lives at home with parents Angela and Simon and three-year-old sister Ellie, sat the paper at Westleigh High School in June. He was overjoyed to receive his grade on results day last week. Thomas was born on February 14 and beats the previous four-year-old record held by Oscar Selby from Surrey, who also secured the top grade in GCSE maths in 2010 at the age of seven. Mr Barnes, 41, said: 'I am so proud of him. When I heard he was the youngest ever it made me cry and I shed a little tear for my late father. I had a blubber. he would have been so proud.' But Oscar was born just a few days earlier in February which means Thomas is a few days older and now takes the title as the youngest ever pupil to gain a top grade. Thomas has had a knack for numbers from a young age and shows potential in a number of other subjects. The youngster, who also loves science, now plans to study physics and chemistry. Thomas with his parents Angela and Simon and three-year-old sister Ellie at home in Lancashire . His parents teach Thomas from home to ensure he is constantly challenged and doesn't get bored. Mr Barnes added: 'We are very proud of Thomas, the future is bright for him. He has done this on his own, with only our help. He loves science and has a natural ability for maths. 'Other than that, he's a normal kid who plays video games. His grandmother gave him £20 as a reward. He spent it on a toy gun for himself and a toy puppy for his sister - he has a heart of gold.' Mr Barnes said Thomas showed astonishing academic ability from an early age and an impressive thirst for knowledge. Thomas decided he wanted to be a scientist when he grows up after watching a documentary about the Large Hadron Collider . He added: 'Thomas was reading quite early, at the age of three, and started writing when he was four. When he was five, his mum picked up a GCSE maths book from a charity shop and we put it aside for when he was older, but he couldn't get his head out of it. 'Some of it was really hard stuff, but he just wanted to learn more and more. We were surprised how much he picked up so quickly. 'We put him through a Key Stage 3 test and he got a level seven, which is high. We then knew the next step was a GCSE exam. He's naturally good with numbers and is very good at figuring things out in his head. 'It's hard keeping up with him. I'm an accountant by trade, so I'm quite good with numbers. Before the exam, I took the same practice paper as him and he beat me. We're delighted for Thomas. Hopefully this will open a few doors for him.' Mr Barnes said they began teaching Thomas at home after taking him to a preschool when he was three. 'He could already read and do basic maths. We were trying to find out what they could teach him and they were saying they would teach him to read but we said he could already do that. We felt it was wasting time. 'At that stage we thought he is not going to learn anything apart from learn to play. But we took him to a lot of playgroups so he could learn to play there. 'When it was time for him to start primary school we were in the same situation as before. We visited 13 primary schools and spoke to many of the headteachers to explain our situation. 'It is hard when there is an exceptionally bright boy. If it were the opposite, say he was dyslexic, he would get some help. It sounds awful but if you are one of the brighter kids you get left alone. We felt the only way to find an education suited to his ability was for us to teach him ourselves. 'I felt in school he would not be getting the help he needs. I was teaching him basic addition and I could see him picking it up quickly. the plan was for him to do a GCSE at 13, two more at 14, three at 15. To spread it out so it would be easier for him. 'We realised he was way ahead at maths when my shop went to Leigh and bought a GCSE maths book from the hospice charity shop for 5p. She brought it home and I started throwing sums at him and he was just taking everything in his stride. He was getting better and better. He just went through the whole book. 'We decided to see if we could put him in for his exam and in February we got confirmation he could sit the exam. before that he would study from 9am until lunchtime. 'From February we increased the teaching to full time so that he would begin, have a lunch break and carry on in the afternoon with a few more lunch breaks. 'We have not hot housed him. The idea of teaching him just happened because we thought he is not going to get stretched at school. 'Education is geared towards the kids below the target line. We just felt Thomas would not learn a lot and that he wouldn't get stretched. 'He has always dictated the pace of learning to us.' Mr Barnes, an accountant, said Thomas decided he wanted to be a scientist when he grows up after watching a documentary about the Large Hadron Collider based near Geneva, Switzerland. Mr Barnes added: 'He has loved science from a young age. When he was three he asked me why leaves are green and wanted to know all the reasons why they are that colour. 'But he always wanted to know more. He just has this thirst to understand the world. I enjoy teaching him.' But his dream of being taught chemistry at home in under threat as his father is unable to buy the right equipment - as the youngster could be considered a terrorist threat. Mr Barnes explained: 'You can't buy the chemicals you need. The companies that sell them will only do so to an educational institution because of fears someone might use the chemicals to make a bomb. 'You can get a basic chemistry set from Argos, but I can't get the equipment I need to teach him because of security fears after 9/11 and 7/7.'","Thomas Barnes secured an A* grade  to beat the previous record .

That's why when you hear music - 90% of the time - it derives from those two feelings. Let's face it. No matter what race, nationality, or religion you are, you have experience with both and you like them!,' he said. Meaningful: Speaking about his new album, Sex and Love, which is out on March 17, the 38-year-old singer said he wanted to be straightforward with the title . Enrique has called in his famous friends for his new album. Single I'm a Freak sees him collaborate with long-time friend Pitbull, he works with Romeo Santos on Loco and duets with Kylie Minogue on Beautiful.

"England bowlers Jamie-Lea Winch and Natalie Melmore suffered a 20-17 defeat in the women's pairs final against South Africa. England were 16-11 ahead but had to force the game into an extra end and South Africa Tracy-Lee Botha and Colleen Piketh took gold. Northern Ireland pair Mandy Cunningham and Barbara Cameron won bronze with a 15-14 win over Jersey's Katie Nixon and Lindsey Greechan. Second best: England duo Jamie-Lea Winch (left) and Natalie Melmore (right) show off their silver medals . Focused: South Africa's Colleen Piketh concentrates on her way to winning gold at Kelvingrove Lawn Bowls Centre . The English pair were 7-1 down but won nine consecutive points and then won six on the trot after falling behind again. Melmore drove home the final bowl against the jack to save the game but a similar shot failed to find its target at the close of the extra end. The 25-year-old Devon bowler, whose younger partner was in tears at the end, said: ""It obviously just wasn't meant to be. We missed it by the smallest of margins. If I had got the jack in the ditch I think that would have been game over. 'It was a great game, we have played well together all this tournament. It;'s the first time we have played at this level together. We are young, we enjoyed it and we are going to come back for more.' Northern Ireland's medal was only their third so far of the Games, although they are guaranteed nine more in the boxing, and their win in a close match prevented Jersey claiming their first medal in any sport since 1990. And for Cameron, it was her first medal in five Games. Not enough: Melmore releases another accurate delivery but the English pair couldn't hold on to win . Hugs all round: The two sets of finalists embrace each other after a dramatic final match . The 52-year-old Ballymena bowler said: 'I've been close to this position on a few occasions but this is it now. It's brilliant, I can't really explain how it feels, it's unbelievable. 'It's a dream come true. You never give up on your dreams.' Cunningham added: 'I'm still in shock. I'm absolutely delighted for Barbara. She has said she is bowing out but I think we might try to talk her round.' When asked how she would be celebrating, the Belfast 50-year-old said: 'Drunk, hopefully. I don't have to get up in the morning so I'm going to enjoy lying in bed with a hangover.""'

"Fallen on his feet: Gavin Grant, the 'fatcat' boss of the RSPCA, who is being paid as much as £160,000 by the animal welfare charity . The new ‘fat cat’ boss of the RSPCA is being paid up to 45 per cent more than his predecessor, figures revealed yesterday. Gavin Grant was accused of ‘brazen greed’ at a time when the animal charity’s income from donations is falling. Figures also showed the RSPCA is spending less on animal welfare, but more on prosecuting people for alleged cruelty. Mr Grant, a former public relations executive and lifelong Liberal Democrat who is credited with helping Nick Clegg become party leader, began as RSPCA chief executive in January 2012. At the time, the charity refused to disclose his pay package, but yesterday its annual report revealed the figure to be between £150,000 and £160,000. The RSPCA still would not state his exact earnings. His predecessor, Mark Watts, earned £110,000 to £120,000, meaning Mr Grant is raking in between £30,000 and £50,000 more – a rise of between 25 per cent and 45 per cent. Two other unidentified bosses are earning up to £150,000 and £130,000. This is believed to be the first time pay has risen above £120,000 at the RSPCA. Anne Kasica, a campaigner who runs the Self-Help Group, an organisation for animal owners ‘experiencing difficulties with the RSPCA’, said: ‘Even we were taken aback by the brazen greed which this represents. ‘Whoever all these highly-paid executives are, this is outrageous. Donations intended to help lost, sick and suffering animals have been, and are being, used to pay at least three people vastly more than last year.’ Fellow campaigner Ernest Vine said: ‘The dwindling number of people who still do without, in order to put money in RSPCA collecting tins, will be horrified at the way their sacrifices are being used.’ Figures in the RSPCA’s annual accounts also reveal that income from donations was down from £45million in 2011 to £44million in 2012; spending on animal welfare was down from £38million to £37million; and financial support given to RSPCA branches was down from £8.8million to £8.2million. But the money spent by the RSPCA on prosecutions rose from £8.7million in 2011 to £11.2million in 2012. Last year the charity was criticised by a judge after spending a ‘staggering’ £326,000 on a magistrates’ court prosecution against David Cameron’s local hunt in Oxfordshire. The Heythrop Hunt became the first to be convicted of illegally killing foxes. It was fined £4,000 after admitting four offences under laws introduced in 2005, but the case was branded politically-motivated by the hunt’s supporters. Guillemots are released back into the wild by RSPCA staff in Dorset: Figures also showed the animal charity is spending less on animal welfare, but more on prosecuting people for alleged cruelty . Last night the RSPCA said: ‘The RSPCA is one of the oldest and largest animal charities in the country and is responsible for the rescue, rehabilitation and rehoming of hundreds of thousands of animals a year. ‘We openly publish our accounts online every year. The figures displayed in this year’s accounts on individual emoluments reflect restructuring costs incurred during 2012, rather than current directors’ salaries. ‘Like many organisations we do not comment on individual salaries. That said our chief executive’s salary is subject to regular independent review and is within the parameters of the going rate for major UK charities, both animal welfare and other.’","Gavin Grant earns up to £160,000 a year as the RSPCA's chief executive .

"Former Hey Dad! child star Sarah Monahan said she 'got away light' compared to her on-screen dad Robert Hughes' other victims - but was relieved and vindicated by his guilty verdict. The principal cast members of TV sitcom Hey Dad! are to appear on A Current Affair on Wednesday, following leading actor Hughes, 65, being convicted of child sex offences on Tuesday. Monahan, who was six years old when she joined the show in 1987, first went public with her story of abuse four years ago in a Woman's Day article in March 2010. She went on to repeat allegations on A Current Affair, that she was abused while on the set of Hey Dad! by Hughes. Scroll down for video . A current scandal: Tracy Grimshaw and the cast of Hey Dad! on the set of A Current Affair. An interview between Grimshaw and (clockwise from top left) Christopher Truswell, Simone Buchanan, Julie McGregor, Christopher Mayer and Sarah Monahan with air on Wednesday night . Secret on set: Robert Hughes'  sexual behaviour on set which included appearing naked and molesting Sarah Monahan was discussed among cast members, clockwise from centre front: Hughes, Simone Buchanan, Christopher Truswell, Julie McGregor, Christopher Mayer, and  Monahan . In another interview on A Current Affair a year later, Monahan said she planned on initiating legal action against Hughes. Now 36, the actress said Hughes' guilty verdict of 10 offences relating to the sexual and indecent assault of young girls in the '80s and '90s 'vindicated' her. Monahan revealed on the program: 'It wasn’t about me. He did some awful, terrible things to them. I feel like I got away lightly,' she told Grimshaw. She claims to have been just 10 years old when she was first flashed by Hughes. Channel Nine revealed on Tuesday night that Julie McGregor, Christopher Mayer, Christopher Truswell, Simone Buchanan, and Sarah Monahan would appear together on the show and be interviewed by Tracy Grimshaw. Discussion: Grimshaw and reporter Ben McCormack made clear on Minday night that the A Current Affair program was instrumental in bringing Hughes to justice . The program's executive producer Grant Williams stopped short of what the cast members were likely to say during the interview, but heaped praise on the victims, the police, and - of course - A Current Affair itself for bringing the case to light. On the Today Show on Wednesday morning, Grimshaw defended the cast's decision to reveal the abuse. 'They have been punished within the industry for speaking out and I think that is the most shocking thing that Hughes has done that, that culture of shut up that culture of cover up,' the host said. By speaking up, Grimshaw said it would empower other victims who were abused as children and break the culture that enabled Hughes to act in this way. 'Some knew more than others. Ben and Simone knew, Chris knew a little bit, this culture of cover up,' which she added still exists now. 'We know he did more things to more people but they don’t want to bring it up,' she said. Scroll down for video . Robyn Gardiner, the partner of actor Robert Hughes (right), looked in shock as she left Downing Centre District Court on Monday after he was convicted of a string of child sex charges . Simone Buchanan supported Monahan in 2010, and testified at Hughes's trial that she had heard allegations about his inappropriate behaviour, but had not seen it herself. In a statement released to the Press, Mr Williams said: 'I just want to pay tribute once again to these brave women who had the courage to come forward. Without them, justice would not have been possible. 'I’m also very proud of the role my team at A Current Affair played in bringing our investigation to the attention of the police, and congratulate the detectives of the NSW Sex Crime Squad on their outstanding police work.' Robert Hughes was convicted on ten of 11 child sex charges on Tuesday - the jury being discharged after not being able to reach a majority verdict on the 11th charge. Brought into Sydney's Downing Centre District Court by prison officers, 65-year-old Hughes looked teary but managed to mouth 'I'm OK' from the dock to his wife. Robert Hughes in Hey Dad!: During his trial for child sex offences against the children of family friends and a Hey Dad! cast member, the court heard from a number of Hughes' former colleagues who accused the former star of repeatedly exposing himself . Celebrity agent Robyn Gardiner asked for a vacant seat in the public gallery so she could be closer to her husband during the jury's verdict on the final two of 11 child sex charges. A Current Affair has a long history with the case, with the Channel Nine show claiming that it was its investigation and its naming of Hughes in 2010 that prompted the police to investigate further. On Monday, while Hughes was still awaiting the jury's verdicts on two charges, a Current Affair's Tracy Grimshaw spoke about the case with reporter Ben McCormack. During the TV segment, Grimshaw said: 'Our involvement in this case dates back to 2010, when we undertook an intensive investigation, and took the unprecedented step of naming Hughes.' McCormack replied: 'We copped a lot of criticism at the time. People were saying ""This is trial by media, why don't these victims go straight to the police? What's the media got to do with this?"". Hughes, pictured arriving at Downing Centre Local Court in March, was convicted of 10 child sex offences  committed between 1983 and 1991 . 'When it comes to historical sexual assault cases, they're very very difficult to prove... If you're a sole victim it's going to be your word versus the perpetrator's. It would be very difficult to come forward. 'Where we came in in this particular case, when people came forward to tell us their stories, other people heard those stories and felt that they could also come forward, and that of course is what led to the police investigation.' McCormack led the praise for officers from the NSW Sex Crimes Squad, who investigated the case for years and had the very difficult taksk of convincing the victims to press forward with their stories and bring a conviction against Hughes. McCormack said: 'The strength of the prosecution case lay in the fact that these women didn't know each other; these women didn't know each other as little girls, they didn't know each other as adults, yet they were all telling very similar stories. 'Added to that, two of these victims went to the police at the time to make complaints.' The trial took almost six weeks to come to a verdict, with Hughes pleading not guilty to all 11 charges against him regarding indecent and sexual assault. The court heard testimonies from former childhood friends of Hughes' daughter, Jessica Hughes, who gave evidence in support of her father at the trial. Two women said Hughes had entered their rooms naked during sleepovers with his daughter, and exposed himself or sexually assaulted them as they lay in bed. Another woman recalled a trip to Manly in which Mr Hughes exposed himself to her while forcing her her to swim between his legs and trapping her there. Former colleagues who worked on set with the former Hey Dad! star also gave evidence at the trial, testifying that Hughes would repeatedly expose himself. Hughes denied all the allegations. The court proceedings took place in Sydney after Hughes was arrested and extradited from London after a two-year police investigation into the accusations.

"A 10-year-old boy who allegedly shot his father dead told police he didn't think he'd get in trouble because he saw an episode of Criminal Minds where a child killed an abusive father and wasn’t arrested. ‘A bad father did something to his kids and the kid did the exact same thing I did - he shot him,’ the boy said in a video recording of an interview played at the boy's murder trial Wednesday. ‘He told the truth and wasn't arrested and the cops believed him. He wasn't in trouble or anything. I thought maybe the exact same thing would happen to me,’ said Joseph Hall. Big influence: A boy claimed he was inspired to kill his neo-Nazi father after watching an episode of Criminal Minds . Prosecutors played the video on the second day of the boy's murder trial in Riverside, California.  He is accused of shooting his father, Jeff Hall, with a .357 Magnum at point-blank range while he slept on a sofa in their home. The prosecution claims Joseph, now 12, killed his dad to keep him from splitting up with his stepmom, while the defense says the stepmother manipulated the boy to shoot Hall because she was angry he might leave her for another woman. In the video Joseph Hall said he wanted to end his father's abuse and to ensure he would live with his stepmother because he thought the couple was going to divorce. He said he was scared and angry about his father's temper and threats. Flag bearer: Passionate extreme right winger Jeff Hall was not afraid to show off his political affiliations . ‘I thought it would be a good idea to end it - to shoot my dad in the head,’ he said in the video. ‘I shot him because I was upset. He was always taking off. He also hit me.’ At one point in the video, the boy says he thought his dad would recover. ‘I was choosing who should leave and I chose my dad,’ the boy said. ‘I thought he would get out of the hospital and maybe we could go back to being friends and start over.’ As the video was shown, the boy clanked his ankle chains and rested his head on the table. The judge stopped the video at one point because the boy was falling asleep. Uniform: Jeff Hall seen after a skirmish during a conference of the National Socialist Movement in Pemberton, New Jersey on April 15, 2011 . The little sister of the boy tearfully testified earlier in the day that her brother had plotted the shooting days in advance.At the time of the shooting, the girl was asleep, but she said her brother told her of his plans four days earlier. ‘Did you know ahead of time that someone planned to shoot your father?’ Chief Deputy District Attorney Michael Soccio asked her. ‘Yes,’ she said quietly. The girl, now 11, also testified that she lied to authorities that stepmother Krista McCary told the boy to shoot Hall. Deadly: A .357 snub nosed revolver like the one used in the killing . McCary initially told police she killed Hall, but testified Tuesday that she was lying to protect the boy. She has pleaded guilty to one felony count of child endangerment and criminal storage of a firearm.If a judge finds the boy murdered his father, he could be jailed until he is 23. Soccio said the white supremacist beliefs of Hall, an unemployed plumber who was a regional leader of the National Socialist Movement, had nothing to do with the crime and that the boy's history of violence dated to his first day of kindergarten when he stabbed a teacher with a pencil. The defense claims the boy was influenced by being raised in an abusive, violent, racist environment where he was taught to shoot, attended Nazi rallies and was taken to the border once on a mission to learn how to keep Mexicans out of the U.S. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Joseph Hall killed his father Jeff with a shot to the head as he slept .

"A former mobster has opened a new Mafia-themed restaurant thanks to crowd funding after he was refused a bank loan because of his criminal past. Angelo Lutz's spent almost eight years in jail for racketeering and opened up an Italian restaurant when he was released in 2008. But when he tried to expand his business, he was unable to secure funding because he is a convicted felon. A changed man: Reformed criminal Angelo Lutz has expanded his New Jersey restaurant business raising more than £100,000 through crowdfunding after being refused a loan because of his criminal past . Gangster theme: The sconces at the restaurant are shaped like 9mm handguns . Embracing his past: Even the sign at Lutz's restaurant echoes that of famous mobster film The Godfather . Mr Lutz, whose weight shot up to 400lbs as he perfected his kitchen craft while behind bars, instead turned to family, friends and crowdfunding site Indiegogo to increase the size of his business. He raised around $100,000 to open new premises in New Jersey. And although he has left his criminal past behind him, he hasn't forgotten it entirely - the logo of the Kitchen Consigliere restaurant echoes that of The Godfather, a mural painted on one of the walls features him alongside famous fictional gangsters such as Don Corleone and Tony Soprano. Even the sconces to hold lights look like 9mm handguns. Lutz made headlines when he was one of seven men convicted in a mob trial in 2001. Although he was originally sentenced to nine years for racketeering, gambling and extortion charges, his sentence was later reduced to eight years. Crime theme: The men's bathroom door has a picture of police chalk markings and bullet holes in it . Hard at work: Lutz, who was jailed in 2001 for extortion, gambling and racketeering charges, pictured in action in the kitchen of his restaurant . Love of food: Lutz (centre) saw his weight rise to 400lbs while in prison where he honed his cooking skills . He is said to have been a bookmaker and debt collector for the Mafia. But Lutz says that his life is all about his business now. He said: 'I never considered myself a gangster. I'm . not a gangster. The government considered me a gangster. The government . considered me a mob associate. 'But what I am now is a . businessman.' Food has always been a big part of the 49-year-old's life and he is said to have cooked the food at his own 'going away party' the night before he went to prison. Big business: Lutz's restaurant is in the Collingswood district of Philadelphia . But it was during his time in jail that he honed his cooking skills. When his restaurant business began to take off, he wanted to expand but couldn't. He said: 'I couldn't get conventional bank loans . because I'm a felon. I broke the law. Shame on you forever, for life.' Since then he . has managed to raise almost $100,000 for renovations from investors and crowd-funding . for his restaurant, which features home-style Italian classics.","Angelo Lutz was jailed for eight years for racketeering and extortion in 2001 .

"The official spokesman of the Islamic State terror group has purportedly issued a chilling message calling on his followers to murder Australians in ghastly ways. In what the Prime Minister's office said was being regarded as a 'genuine threat' by the nation's security agencies, senior IS leader Abu Mohammed al-Adnani on Monday released an audio message specifically calling for attacks on people of a number of nationalities, including Australians. al-Adnani said: 'If you can kill a disbelieving American or European – especially the spiteful and filthy French – or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be.' Scroll down for video . Threats: Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, pictured (above) in a terror message posted on YouTube in July 2012. Sick threats: The Islamic State terror group has released videos of a militant beheading three Westerners in recent times. Terror suspect Omarjan Azari, 22, pictured (above) being taken away from court. He was charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism last Thursday. Heavily armed NSW Corrective Services officers prepare to transport accused terrorist Omarjan Azari from Central Local Court after appearing on a charge of conspiracy to prepare for a terrorist act. 'Do not ask for anyone’s advice and do not seek anyone’s verdict.' 'Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military, for they have the same ruling.' In the statement, Al-Adnani purportedly implored his followers to commit a number of graphic crimes against 'disbelieving American (sic), Frenchman, or any of their allies'. 'Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.' And in a lengthy series of rhetorical questions addressed to the 'soldier of the Islamic State', he appeared to question Australia's involvement in the Middle Eastern conflict. 'Why have the nations of disbelief entrenched together against you?' he asked. 'What threat do you pose to the distant place of Australia for it to send its legions towards you? What does Canada have anything to do with you?' The militant's message follows the disruption of an alleged Sydney beheading plot in the nation's largest ever terror raids last Thursday. In a statement, a spokesman for the Prime Minister told Daily Mail Australia the government believed the terrorist's statement was real. 'Australian agencies regard the statement issued today by ISIL calling for attacks against members of the international coalition, including Australians, as genuine,' the spokesman said, using an alternative name for the IS terror group. Police remove a sword as part of evidence found at a residential property in the suburb of Marsfield, in Sydney last Thursday. Raids: Australia witnessed its largest ever terror raids last Thursday, when Australian Federal Police and NSW Police agents swarmed a number of properties across Sydney. Raids were also conducted in Brisbane. Addressing the terror threat to the nation, Prime Minister Tony Abbott today said that Australia's 'delicate balance' between freedom and security may have to tilt towards security 'for some time to come'. A U.S. State Department notice described al-Adnani, born under the name  Taha Sobhi Falaha, as the 'official spokesman and a senior leader of ISIL'. He is the 'main conduit for the dissemination of official messages', the notice said. Al-Adnani's chilling threat came as the Federal Government outlined its plans for new anti-terror legislation on Monday afternoon. Mr Abbott told Parliament he could not promise that 'hideous events' will never take place in Australia. 'Regrettably, for some time to come, Australians will have to endure more security than we’re used to, and more inconvenience than we’d like,' he said. 'Regrettably, for some time to come, the delicate balance between freedom and security may have to shift.'","Senior Islamic State spokesman specifically names Australia as target in threatening audio message .

"Manchester United footballer Rio Ferdinand has been banned from driving - after being caught speeding on the same road three times in less than six weeks. The 33-year-old defender, who has played 81 times for England, was given a six-month ban despite being represented by lawyer Nick Freeman, nicknamed Mr Loophole for his ability to get celebrities off driving charges. Mr Freeman argued that Ferdinand had no idea he was on the verge of being disqualified when he was caught driving a Jaguar XJ at 38mph in a 30mph zone on Chester Road in Stretford, near Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium. Banned: Football star Rio Ferdinand has been disqualified from driving after being caught speeding three times on the same road in less than six weeks . The car was registered to Jaguar, and the luxury car company had received notifications of two earlier offences but had not forwarded them on, the lawyer told Trafford Magistrates' Court. The footballer already had three points on his licence from a previous matter. But he was oblivious to the fact that the figure had trebled to nine before the final offence, Mr Freeman said. 'He was a victim of the modern day detection system,' the lawyer told magistrates. Ferdinand was caught twice by the same camera on Chester Road in January and once by another nearby at 2.20pm on February 9. Mr Freeman claimed that, had Ferdinand been stopped by an officer and made aware of the offence, he would not have repeated it. Repeat offender: Rio Ferdinand, pictured driving to Manchester United's training ground, was caught twice by the same camera in January and again by a camera nearby on February 9 . He said: 'The adrenalin would have kicked in, he would have had sweaty palms and he would not have done it again.' Mr Freeman, who has represented Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the past, admitted that a defence of hardship could not be argued as Ferdinand clearly had the means to afford a driver. However, the lawyer pointed out that a lengthy ban would prevent the footballer from spending 'quality time' with his two sons, aged six and four, who he drives to school. Mr Freeman said that his client wanted to keep his children as grounded as possible and not spoil them and that the 'dynamics of their relationship' would change if he was banned. He also argued that a short ban would leave Ferdinand on nine points with the threat of a ban hanging over him whereas a six-month penalty would hand him back a clean licence. Lawyer: Ferdinand (right) was represented by Nick Freeman, nicknamed Mr Loophole for his ability to get celebrities off driving charges . But magistrates declined to take up this offer and imposed the ban. The footballer, who was not in court, was also ordered to a £500 fine, £35 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Freeman said: 'I will reflect upon the magistrates’ decision and advise my client accordingly.' Ferdinand today rebuffed offers of a chauffeur after details of the case were widely reported. Reacting to the ban on his official Twitter account, Ferdinand wrote: 'Didn't know so many drivers followed me!! Thanks for the offers but I'm cool, I'm sorted on the drivers front. #speedkills'. Response: Rio Ferdinand wrote on his Twitter page to rebuff offers of a chauffeur . Manchester United declined to comment on the case. Ferdinand's ban comes only a week after Mr Freeman represented another Manchester United footballer, Danny Welbeck, who was caught doing 82mph in a 50mph zone. Welbeck, 21, escaped a ban and was ordered to pay £60 for the offence in the Northenden area of Manchester last November. Ferdinand is the fourth top footballer to be prosecuted for driving offences in the last fortnight. In addition to the Welbeck case, Manchester City midfielder Michael Johnson has been banned for drink driving and former Arsenal star Patrick Vieira was disqualified for speeding. Clocked: Ferdinand was caught doing 38mph in a 30mph zone by a camera on Chester Road, Stretford - his third speeding offence on the road in less than six weeks .","Footballer, 33, was caught doing 38mph in a 30mph zone in February .

"Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking today at 10 Downing Street, spelled out his determination to stop taxpayers' money being used to bail out Greece . David Cameron today spelled out his determination to stop taxpayers’ money being used to bail out Greece. He used forthright language to describe his attitude towards the bailed-out economy costing Europe a fortune at his weekly Downing Street press conference. 'We were not involved in the first bailout of Greece, we don't believe the European financial mechanism should be used in any way,' Mr Cameron said. He told business leaders the UK had . no obligation to help Greece other than through the International . Monetary Fund because Britain had, ‘thank God’, stayed out of the euro. The Prime Minister said he would make . his position clear later this week at a summit for the 27 European Union . leaders – a meeting which will be dominated by the debt crisis. His comments came as eurozone finance . ministers gave Greece two weeks to approve stricter austerity measures . before they are prepared to sign off a second emergency loan of . £11billion. World stocks and the euro rose from last week's three-week lows today following the eurozone ultimatum. Investors are awaiting a parliamentary confidence vote for Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, a step towards the passage of more spending cuts in exchange for foreign loans. World stocks are down nearly 8 per cent from their three-year high set in May as investors grew worried disorderly restructuring of Greek debt would cause ructions in the market and hit the region's banking sector. Mr Cameron used forthright language to describe his attitude towards the bailed-out economy costing Europe a fortune at his weekly Downing Street press conference . Parliament will debate the confidence . vote against a backdrop of deep public anger over the pain of the . austerity measures. IMF and European inspectors have arrived in Athens . to discuss changes requested by Greece to the reform package. Unions and grassroots activists will . protest at parliament ahead of the vote, building on more than three . weeks of demonstrations that erupted into violence last week and split . the ruling PASOK party. If the confidence vote is passed, the Greek parliament will vote on the austerity measures by June 28. Debt crisis timeline: Charts the value of the euro against the dollar, identifying the main events in the ongoing Greek debt crisis .

'I . don’t believe that we will and I shall be fighting very hard to achieve . that at the European Council this week.’ Speaking at The Times newspaper’s CEO . summit, the Prime Minister said: ‘The first Greek bailout was done by . eurozone members and I see absolutely no reason why Britain should be . dragged in through European financial mechanisms or other mechanisms to . support a subsequent Greek bailout. ‘We are not in the euro, we chose not to join the euro and so I don’t think we share responsibility for this. ‘Yes, obviously we are members of the . IMF, we make contributions though the IMF to all countries, but I’m . absolutely determined we should stay out of European efforts to put more . money into Greece. ‘Of course we want a healthy euro.

Riot police officers, foreground, stand guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier during a protest in Athens today . Employees of the state-owned company Hellenic Defence Systems protest against privatisation proposals today in front of the Greek parliament . Boiling over: A protester throws a table at a fire in Athens' central Syntagma Square during clashes yesterday . WHAT'S NEXT? WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? Greece has a sovereign debt pile of 340 billion euros (£301 billion), more than 30,000 euros per person in a population of 11.3 million. The 110-billion-euro bailout Greece accepted last year from the European Union and International Monetary Fund has proved insufficient and a second package worth 120 billion euros is now under discussion. Greece's current debt is equivalent to 150 per cent of its annual output. Its people have lost patience with an ever-deepening austerity drive that has slashed public sector wages by a fifth and pensions by a tenth. WHY DOES IT MATTER OUTSIDE GREECE? The longer the crisis drags on, the greater the risk that contagion will spread to other troubled eurozone economies like Ireland and Portugal, which have also been bailed out before, and Spain, which is much bigger and would possibly be too expensive to rescue. A default by Greece would hammer the banks that hold its debt, including the European Central Bank and big French and German lenders. SO WHY NOT JUST BAIL GREECE OUT AGAIN? The EU's big players - notably Germany, France and the European Central Bank - have struggled to work out a rescue mechanism. European governments are keen to avoid a 'hard default' because this could threaten banks in eurozone and further afield. WHAT ABOUT THE GREEK PEOPLE? Public disgruntlement over austerity - including curbs on widespread early retirement, tax rises and cuts in benefits and wages - has erupted into frequent strikes and protests, some of them violent. Unemployment is rising. In a poll last month, 80 per cent of people said they would make any more sacrifices to get aid. HOW DID IT COME TO THIS? Greece, whose economy had grown strongly but suffered problems with corruption and bureaucracy, joined the eurozone a decade ago. It went into recession in 2009 after 15 years of growth and its budget deficit hit 15.4 per cent of GDP after a series of revisions by the government which revealed the country's economy was in far worse shape than it had previously admitted. The Greek crisis reflects an inherent weakness in the euro's structure - a currency zone with a ""one size fits all"" interest rate for a set of widely divergent economies, and 17 different countries running their own fiscal policies. 'But because we are not members of the . euro I don’t think on this occasion in this country we have an . obligation.’ A Treasury minister warned last night that Britain was preparing for the end of the euro. If Greece’s debt crisis forced it to . quit the euro, it would have ‘a very significant economic impact’ on . Britain, said Mark Hoban, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. Officials said UK banks stand to lose £8billion if the Greek economy . goes under. It came as former Foreign Secretary . Jack Straw led MPs from all sides in predicting the death of the single . currency, warning: ‘Is it not better that it happens quickly rather than . a slow death?’ He said the Government should be . honest and admit the single currency is on the brink of collapse. He . told the Commons: ‘The eurozone cannot last. In its current form [it] is . going to collapse.’ The IMF also warned the Greek  crisis . could threaten the stability of the entire eurozone, Britain’s biggest . trading partners. Mr Hoban admitted the Government was preparing . contingency plans for a euro meltdown with the Bank of England and the . Financial Services Authority. He refused to say whether ‘the . eurozone will stay intact’, a coded reference to Greece ditching the . single currency. But he added: ‘This crisis demonstrates the huge strain . the eurozone is under. That’s why it was right for us to stay out of . the eurozone. ‘The Treasury, together with the Bank . of England and the FSA, are monitoring the financial system, including . the euro area, on an ongoing basis. Many scenarios are considered. ‘Continued instability in the eurozone could be one of the factors that could hold back the recovery of the British economy.’ In a report yesterday, the IMF said the eurozone faced being ‘overwhelmed’ by the crisis. It . added: ‘Much remains to be done to secure a resilient monetary union. 'A . strong core is pulling ahead of a periphery facing daunting challenges, . with very high debt levels, severe competitiveness problems and fragile . banking systems. ‘While . courageous attempts have been made to address the crisis, policymakers . are again facing uncomfortable dilemmas, raising uncertainty about the . final outcome.’ The euro and the stock market took a tumble yesterday after EU finance ministers refused to give Greece the next £11billion slice of the £100billion European bailout unless it agreed to £25billion in cuts – a move that caused rioting in Athens. The violence almost led to the collapse of the Greek government after thousands took to the streets in protest at the austerity measures. Rioters clashed in bloody skirmishes with 5,000 police using stun grenades. The fragile state of the 17-member currency was exposed by  Belgian finance minister Didier Reyders, who said Greece had lied about its finances for a decade while EU chiefs looked away. Taxpayers face liabilities of around £1billion from Britain’s membership of the IMF.","'Thank God' Britain stayed out of the euro, says Prime Minister .

"The Championship play-off final is famously the single most lucrative one-off fixture in the whole of global sport, and it’s now richer than ever. Sportsmail can reveal that the payday for the winner of this weekend’s showdown between Derby County and QPR will be £134million - at least. That sum is new income that the winner will accrue, at minimum, over the next five years, that the loser will not. It’s winner takes all, and that £134m is a worse-case scenario. Big money: The Championship play-off final is the most lucrative one-off fixture in global sport . £134m - for winning 2013-14 Championship play-off . £47.7m - most lucrative boxing purse ever, Floyd Mayweather’s earnings from his fight against Canelo Alvarez last year . £13.8m - the biggest prize ever for winning a single cricket match, Allen Stanford’s notorious West Indies Superstars v England Twenty20 in 2008 . £6.9m - the biggest prize in golf, the bonus for winning the FedExCup . £6.9m - the biggest prize in horse racing, for winning the Dubai Cup . £5.97m - or $10m, which is the difference in prize money between winning this summer’s World Cup in Brazil ($35m) and being runner-up ($25m) £3.26m - or 4m euros, which is the difference in prize money between winning this year’s Champions League final (10.5m euros) and being runner-up (6.5m euros) That sum is broken down into £62m of Premier League prize money even if finishing bottom of the Premier League next season, plus four years of subsequent ‘parachute’ payments totaling a further £72m at least. Parachute payments are made to relegated clubs for four years after going down and are based on a complicated formula relating to what clubs in the top division earn from central funds each season. To simplify matters, that £72m is expected to be made up of parachute payments of around £26.4m in 2015-16, £21.6m the following year, and £12m in each of the two years after that. Prize: Queens Park Rangers will be hoping to beat Derby County for a place in the Premier League . Worth it: Crystal Palace have managed to build on their 2013 success and stay in the Premier League . It may in fact rise in the final two years depending on the value of future TV contracts signed from 2016 onwards but that cannot be forecast specifically at this stage. To stress the point: the £134 million is a worse-case scenario of new income for the play-off winner. If they don’t immediately get relegated, their new riches will be bigger and last for longer. And they will almost certainly earn extra ticket income and sponsorship cash from being in the Premier League on top of the extra central revenue. There is an argument that the play-off is worth not nearly as much as the headline figure because the extra money will inevitably be spent on pricey signings and big wages - and that is a perfectly legitimate argument because most promoted clubs do in fact spend most of the new cash on those things. But that is not mandatory. Promoted clubs do not always do that. Some use it to improve facilities, invest in academies, or simply boost the owners coffers. Carrot: Steve McClaren's Derby can scoop the £134m jackpot with a win against QPR at Wembley . Lucrative: Floyd Mayweather (right) earned £47.7m from his fight against Canelo Alvarez (left) Premier League referee Lee Mason will take charge of the Championship play-off final match between QPR and Derby at Wembley pn Saturday. Whichever way you look at it, winning the play-off brings a massive windfall, a windfall that in 2014 will be £134m... and counting. As the accompanying panel shows, the stakes are higher in the play-off by far than for any other one-off event in global sport. The 'marginal gain' of winning and losing this weekend's Champions League final, for example, is a mere £3.26m, or the difference in extra prize money between the winner (10.5m euros) and runner-up (6.5m euros). Cost: There is a difference of £3.26m between winning and losing the Champions League final .","The Championship play-off final winners will accrue £134m over the next five years .

The promoted club will earn £62m just for being in the Premier League next season .

"Everybody loves a hug - but would you want to snuggle up to twenty total strangers? The pair running London's 'cuddle club' certainly hope so. Anna Nathan Shekory, 37, and Tom Fortes Mayer, 40, are the brains behind the Cuddle Workshops - and they're proving a hit with affection-starved Londoners. The class, held in upmarket Hampstead, offers a 'safe space for people to indulge in therapeutic non-sexual touching'. There, you'll find men and women spooning, hugging, nuzzling, snuggling, holding hands - and piling in for group cuddles of twenty or more. Scroll down for video . Anna set up the class after experiencing an epiphany about the therapeutic power of cuddling . 'I grew up in a Middle Eastern family. My family were very cuddly, we used to all pile on to the couch like little monkeys,' Anna said. 'As I grew up I got very confused about why people in our society weren't doing that. British culture in general was very closed-off physically.' Anna experienced an epiphany about the therapeutic power of cuddling during a hug with a group of strangers at a festival in 2010. After touring the site with her new-found friends offering hugs to festivalgoers, she set up the Cuddle Workshop. People cuddle up to each other during the class in the Cuddle Workshop in West Hampstead . Anna got together with Tom, a Harley . Street hypnotherapist, a year ago after meeting at a Language of Love workshop event. 'A very big part of our relationship is cuddling,' Anna said. 'Tom is super cuddly and that makes such a big difference for me. I couldn't date someone who wasn't a good cuddler.' Tom is now an integral part of the Cuddle Workshop and leads some sections of the class. Anna is keen to dispel the idea that the £29, four-hour class is only for the lonely and affection-starved. Cuddle Workshop facilitators and real-life couple Anna and Tom interact with people in their class . Anna directs the class in a spot of 'freestyle cuddling' in which attendees engage in a mass cuddle . 'I think people come to the workshop for many different reasons, there are some people who're single and they want to have physical contact with people in a safe environment where nothing's expected of them,' she said. 'Some people come because they're used to lots of cuddles from their family, and perhaps they're living in a new town or a new country. 'Then there are those who simply love cuddling and meeting new people.' Cuddling releases oxytocin - the so-called love hormone - which Anna says boosts people's self-esteem and helps them feel more comfortable in their own bodies. The class also includes a section in which attendees can have their 'cuddle wishes' fulfilled - for example by pretending to be a cat being stroked. The workshop finishes with a spot of 'freestyle cuddling', in which attendees engage in a mass cuddle. 'Freestyle cuddlers', some of whom may be 'people who're single and they want to have physical contact' Group hug: Some cuddlers snuggle up en masse, while others prefer to hug in pairs . 'A lot of people just lie down in the middle, there's a lot of spooning, there's a chance for people just to be really loving with each other, to just be relaxed and connected and loving,' Tom said.'It's just the most beautiful thing to facilitate, to see and participate in.' Cuddle club attendees are encouraged to go at their own pace and are taught how to politely turn down a cuddle if they feel in any way uncomfortable. Anna has plans to expand her cuddle empire by setting up Cuddle Workshop all over the country. 'I really hope the workshop can make a difference and help Britain become more cuddly as a nation,' she added.

"A debate in the House of Lords is the last place you expect to hear someone fantasise about making love to George Clooney. But it is precisely what cheeky typist-turned-Tory Minister Tina Stowell did when she persuaded fuddy-duddy peers to back gay marriage laws. Lords Leader Baroness Stowell used Clooney to explain how a man who married another man could only sue for adultery if his partner had sex with a woman, not a man. For example, she told dumbstruck peers, if Clooney married a gay man and then had a fling with her – ‘and who could blame him?’ she added coyly – Clooney’s ‘husband’ could sue him for adultery with her. Crush: Baroness Stowell, who referred to George Clooney in a debate, with a cardboard cut-out of the actor . Sure enough, a photo of Stowell alongside a life-sized cardboard cut- out of the star has pride of place in her tennis court-sized, red leather and wood-panelled Lords office, where we chatted. ‘I’ve had a soft spot for him ever since I saw him in ER,’ she says. ‘I needed to relax peers who were tense about gay marriage, so I thought, “I’ll bring in George Clooney.” ’ And fantasise about having sex with him? ‘A bit of humour helps,’ she smiles. Stowell is to extend the gay marriage laws in the next few weeks, allowing gay people who took part in civil partnerships before gay marriage was legalised to ‘upgrade’ it into a formal marriage. ‘It’s important for them to say not “I’m sort of married” but that they are married,’ she says. When Stowell was made Lords Leader – a Cabinet Minister in all but name – in July, some grandees were appalled, even more than when she was ennobled three years ago. They reacted with the same haughty disdain that Downton Abbey’s Earl of Grantham showed sparky kitchen maid Daisy on learning she was studying maths instead of washing dishes. ‘Tina should be pushing the tea trolley at Cabinet, not sitting at the table,’ scoffed one, a reference to her having been PA to John Major and William Hague. In truth, ‘the Earl of Downing Street’ David Cameron had exposed her to such insults by denying Stowell full-blown Cabinet status – and £22,000 extra pay – given to her predecessor. Stowell, 5ft 1in, faced a revolt led by Baroness Betty Boothroyd, who accused the PM of ‘trampling on the constitution’. Didn’t little Tina feel cowed by all these people fulminating at her? ‘I don’t feel intimidated by anybody. I was brought up to believe I’m as good as anyone else.’ Spoken like Daisy. Stowell's doggedness and impish charm was widely credited with wooing reluctant peers to her cause . Stowell, 47, whose dad Dave was a painter and decorator and mum Margaret worked in a factory in the same street as their terrace house in Beeston, Nottinghamshire (‘it was posh, we had an inside loo’, she laughs) left her local comp aged 16 with five O-levels. She showed her gritty determination aged 14, landing a weekend job at a cake shop. ‘They said I couldn’t work out front until I knew the price of all 100 cakes,’ she says. ‘When I went back the next week, they couldn’t believe I knew them all.’ How much was a doughnut? ‘12p,’ she answers. ‘If I saw a big queue outside I’d try my hardest to get it down and it brought a big smile to my face when I did.’ Doesn’t it require loftier thinking to be a Cabinet Minister? She swats it away like a fly on a sticky bun. ‘The Lords may seem a million miles from the cake shop, but those people in the queue are who I think of when I do my job here,’ she says. Her cool confidence and prim porcelain glamour is a far cry from the unworldly lass mistaken for a hooker when, aged 18, she was dropped off by mum and dad at a hostel in London, for her first Civil Service job as a secretary. ‘I was stopped by a bloke who said “Are you looking for business?” I said “Sorry?” I didn’t know what he was on about. When I told the girls in the hostel, they said “Didn’t you know? This a red light area”.’ Her horizons widened with a stint at the British Embassy in Washington, and she joined Downing Street when John Major was Prime Minister. She recalls her rage when she overheard a plummy-voiced Tory sneer at ‘ignorant’ Major, unaware his loyal PA was listening. ‘The very things people criticised him for like his humble background are why I admired him. I don’t like snobs,’ she says. She formed the same bond with the next Tory leader William Hague, adding: ‘When he stepped down, I sobbed my heart out.’ But there were tears of joy when, a decade later, now a Minister with her own PA, she piloted the gay marriage laws through the Lords. ‘I was choked with happiness,’ she says. Baroness Stowell told dumbstruck peers that if Clooney married a gay man and then had a fling with her, Clooney's 'husband' could sue him for adultery with her . First she had to persuade crusty peers to take notice of someone who had never been married herself. Again she deployed her ‘friend’ George Clooney, telling the Lords bold as brass in her broad Nottinghamshire accent: ‘I’m single but as long as George Clooney is available I’m prepared to wait.’ Even peers who raged about the ‘evils of buggery’ softened. Stowell’s doggedness and impish charm was widely credited with wooing reluctant peers to her cause. That was a year ago. Clooney is married now. ‘It’s his loss, there you go, no more excuses,’ she grins. She has never been short of male admirers, so why no marriage? ‘No one ever asked me!’ You have to go looking. ‘Maybe I’ll start.’ Mmm. Perhaps it is the price she has paid for her career? ‘No,’ she says firmly, ‘I don’t rule it out, though I’m probably past having children. Mum drilled it into me never to be financially dependent on a man, get a job, fend for yourself.’ The gay marriage law made her a gay icon, leading to awards from Pink News and Spectator magazine. Stowell’s, dare I say it, rather raunchy, pixie-like Twitter photo has a hint of the Judy Garland in it. She is dolled up, albeit on a budget. Her black and berry Precis Petite jacket is £79 from the suitably conservative House of Fraser. Some gay rights campaigners have speculated whether petite Stowell is gay? ‘Oh really?’ she replied. Is she? ‘No,’ she says, her bright blue bush baby eyes gleaming. And she is again quick to scotch any idea that she may never marry. ‘If a fantastic guy turned up and offered me a life better than the one I have now, why would I say no?’ she says. ‘Now George Clooney is taken, I’m back on the market.’","Lords Leader used Clooney to explain how a man who married another man could only sue for adultery if his partner had sex with a woman, not a man .

"Russian observers have joined online conspiracy theorists claiming the Scottish referendum was rigged - saying that the room that the count took place in was too big. The voting process didn't conform to 'generally accepted international principles of referendums' according to Igor Borisov, who watched the ballots being counted in Edinburgh's Royal Highland Centre. Mr Borisov, chairman of the Russian Public Institute of Suffrage, was one of four accredited Russian observers who were sent to watch the ballots being counted following last night's historic vote. Scroll down for video . When asked for specific examples of the violations he witnessed, Mr Borisov claimed that the size of the room made it 'impossible' to keep an eye on all the counters. Above, ballot boxes enter the Edinburgh hall . Speaking to state news agency RIA Novosti, he claimed that the way the count was conducted varied greatly from 'generally accepted international principles'. When asked for specific examples of the violations he witnessed, Mr Borisov claimed that the size of the room made it 'impossible' to keep an eye on all the counters. He said: 'This place is a hangar for aircraft, located next to the airfield. The hangar has dimensions of approximately 100 by 300 meters. 'Even if you wish, it is impossible to see what is going on at these tables.' He added that the boxes were kept in the room without any protection. The counting took place in the Royal Highland Centre in Edinburgh, which is normally used as an exhibition centre and showground. Borisov said the US state department, the UK and other western countries loudly criticised the Kremlin about Russia's supposed democratic deficiencies. But in this instance, he said, London and Edinburgh had not 'fully met' the requirements of a proper referendum. Mr Borisov also claimed that there was little interest as to who was bringing in the voting sheets and said that there were 'no signatures' given as the ballots were given to the counters. Above, votes counted in Edinburgh . Mr Borisov also claimed that there was little interest as to who was bringing in the voting sheets and said that there were 'no signatures' given as the ballots were given to the counters. He said that this lack of identification between those involved in the counting process would make it impossible to determine at what point 'rigging' occurred - and who committed it. He explained that the size of the room made it 'impossible' to watch where the votes were being taken. Mr Borisov's comment as a number of conspiracy theorists have uploaded videos to YouTube, claiming to have footage showing electoral fraud in action. One video shows a clip of a female counter shuffling piles of votes on the table in front of her. The man behind the footage claims that she is moving Yes votes into the No pile - dramatically reducing the number of ballots. The voting process didn't conform to 'generally accepted international principles of referendums' according to Igor Borisov, who watched the ballots being counted at the Royal Highland Centre in Edinburgh, pictured above . Another clip shows a man sitting at a desk in the Edinburgh counting room, pen in hand. Two different conspiracy theorists claim that the footage - which was broadcast last night on television - shows him filling in a ballot and committing fraud. Others have taken to Twitter to voice their concern over suspected fraud. One user said: 'There's definitely something to these vote allegations.' Another posted: 'All the Scots were robbed, they need a new vote #IndyRef #English_Fraud'. A number posted a photo to Twitter of ballots marked 'Yes' on a table above a 'No' sign in the Dundee counting centre. While Twitter users claimed that this showed the votes were being miscounted, the Yes Dundee Twitter account explained that the votes simply hadn't been counted yet. Mr Borisov, chairman of the Russian Institute of Suffrage, was one of four accredited Russian observers who were sent to watch the ballots being counted following last night's historic vote. Above, an observer watches . The online claims come after police announced last night that they are investigating ten cases of suspected electoral fraud. Voters turned up at polling stations to find that people had already voted using their names. Glasgow City Council confirmed that there had been 10 instances where people had gone to vote and found their names had already been crossed off the list. Spokesman Colin Edgar said: 'We've had a number of suggestions across the course of the day that people have turned up at the polling station to vote and they appear to have voted already. 'This is impersonation, if it turns out to be what it is.' Last night police officers were present at the count to remove the ballot papers and keep them as evidence. The papers were from 10 different boxes across Glasgow, and not concentrated in one area.","Igor Borisov was one of four accredited Russian observers in Edinburgh .

"For almost 20 years, Dame Catherine Cookson was the most popular author in British libraries, with more copies of her novels borrowed than any other writer. But she has suffered a massive drop in popularity – not even managing to make the top ten most popular authors of the past nine years. Out with the old: Cookson's popularity has waned . And in the latest annual charts, for 2010-2011, she ranked a lowly 147th in the list of most borrowed writers, as readers find her work – inspired by her illegitimate childhood and grinding poverty in the North East – increasingly irrelevant. Instead they are opting for ‘grittier’ crime novels by authors such as James Patterson. Ms Cookson’s spectacular fall from popularity is detailed in figures that have been obtained from the Public Lending Right, which distributes library royalties to authors. She made the top 20 authors in only three of the past nine years, with around 3.5million of her titles lent over that time. It is a far cry from 1997, when nine of the top ten most popular library books were hers. The figures are the second blow to Cookson’s reputation in less than  a year, after South Tyneside Council decided to drop its ‘outdated’ Catherine Cookson Country tourist slogan. South Tyneside mayor Eileen Leask, 64, said Cookson’s popularity was on the wane as a new generation of readers found it hard to relate to her. She said: ‘I don’t think it’s something we should be too upset about because she had her day and she brought  history to life. 'I think people my age could actually connect with the stories in a certain way, but times have changed and people have moved on. ‘Her books tended to be the same story every time and they were based on certain types of characters, such  as the strong woman bringing up her  family against the odds. 'She had a very hard life, partly because she was illegitimate, but that is a stigma people simply can’t relate to any more.’ Cookson was the most borrowed author in Britain for 17 consecutive years from 1984 to 2000, but she fell off the top ten in 2005. And from 2002 to 2011, she ranks No 15. A new chapter: Authors such as James Patterson have overtaken Cookson in the popularity stakes . Dr Jim Parker, registrar of the  Public Lending Right, said: ‘I suspect a couple of things are going on. Her death in 1998 means there are no new books and our experience is that if you are not getting books on to the shelves, then popularity fades away. Top ten: The most borrowed authors . ‘Another reason is a change of taste. We have seen the growing popularity of what we might call gritty crime thrillers, both Scandinavian and American. Authors like James Patterson are mopping up at the moment. ‘It was my mother’s generation who liked the Cookson books. There is  a slight datedness about them now.’ Patterson, the American thriller writer, has topped the annual list for the past five years. The author, who signed a reported $150 million (£95 million) publishing deal in 2009, has achieved 14 million loans since 2002. He has replaced Dame Jacqueline Wilson, the children’s writer and creator of the Tracy Beaker stories as Britain’s most borrowed author –  at the top of the annual list, although over the past nine years as a whole, Wilson narrowly takes the top slot. Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling is  a noticeable absentee from the list of the most borrowed authors. Dr Parker said that was probably because she had written only a handful of titles. Britain’s 4,500 libraries make about 300 million loans a year and British-based authors receive an average of 6p a time, capped at £6,600 a year.

"Ageing, written off, derided. It just had to be Bobby Zamora who scored the £134million goal that took QPR back into the Premier League and quite probably saved them from financial ruin. Having been dominated by Steve McClaren’s youthful and energetic Derby County for 89 minutes, 50 seconds, rickety old QPR and their 33-year-old centre forward only needed one late glimpse to separate the men from the boys. County skipper Richard Keogh mistimed a clearance straight to the injury-prone striker and he returned it in a flash into the top corner of the net.

With 10 second left, QPR were back in the promised land, and . that despite playing the majority of the second-half with only 10 men . following Gary O’Neil’s red card. Extraordinary scenes. For . two years, Rangers and Fernandes have rightly received savage criticism . as a squad paid more than Borussia Dortmund were relegated and then . failed to ignite the Championship. Zamora . was one of the poster-boys for underachievement. He went into . yesterday’s showpiece at Wembley having scored four goals in 20 months, . though in mitigation he missed four months of this season to recover . from a knee operation. And . yet in a split-second, he showed the quality that once won him a couple . of England caps and persuaded QPR to spend £6million on him at the start . of 2012. His instant left-foot finish had Derby keeper Lee Grant . clutching thin air. Keogh was inconsolable for the rest of the . afternoon, and possibly all summer. Zamora . is one of 15 players out of contract at Loftus Road this season. It may . turn out to be his last game in a Hoops shirt but even if that’s the . case his place in the club’s history is now assured. The . club‘s latest financial figures reported a loss of £65m. Even by . the unreal standards of the Championship play-off final, Rangers needed . this result to go their way. Early bath: Gary O'Neil holds his head in his hands after being sent off . Hacked down: Johnny Russell is fouled from behind by O'Neil . ‘I don’t know how we did it,’ admitted a relieved and stunned Redknapp afterwards. ‘It . was an amazing finish.

That was the only hope I could see for us with 10 men, I . wanted to keep it tight and get to penalties, I’d be lying if I said . otherwise. ‘I was surprised to score! But when Bobby is fit, he is an excellent player. ‘It . was just a backs-to-the-wall job before then. I think we defended well . with 10 men; Robert Green, Richard Dunne, Nedum Onouha, they all . defended for their lives.’ Redknapp embraced Fernandes afterwards. Zamora’s stike has saved both from different types of oblivion. Derby . had finished the regular season in third place, five points ahead of . Rangers, and were the better team at Wembley foiled repeatedly by QPR keeper Robert Green, whose own career is back on the up after his World Cup . horribilis in 2010.

But I’m so proud of the players. ‘It . is going to take few days and weeks to recover. We stayed on the field . afterwards to applaud QPR and watch them celebrate and pick up the cup, . go into the Premier League. ‘We . don’t want that kind of hurt again, because it does hurt. Maybe we will . try to go straight up next time! But if this team sticks together, it . will get stronger.’ Despite a . heavy and dramatic downpour as the teams came out, McClaren didn’t . emerge with the brolly he infamously used on his last Wembley appearance . as England manager in 2007. The . first half was largely forgettable with Lee Mason rightly waving away . a Derby penalty appeal when Will Hughes jumped over Richard Dunne the . only moment of controversy. Running from the brolly: Derby Manager Steve McClaren looks to avoid the rain . On he goes: Derby County's Jeff Hendrick looks to beat Niko Kranjcar . Come here: QPR's Joey Barton looks to chase down Forsyth . But . as the sun peeped out at the start of the second half, the serious . action began – and nearly all of it in and around the QPR penalty area. Green made great saves from Jamie Ward, Craig Bryson and Simon Dawkins. Ward’s goalbound shot was blocked by his own player Chris Martin as . Derby outran Rangers and laid siege to the goal. Derby . thought they’d cracked it after an hour. Johnny Russell nicked the ball . past Dunne and when his heels were clipped by O’Neil, the . Rangers man went after discussion between Mr Probert and his assistant. County . swarmed forward but the Rangers rearguard wouldn’t crack.

Flying the flag: QPR fans show their support for their team . Outnumbered: Armand Traore has a shot at goal during the play-off final .

We must love to do things the hard way but it . means twice as much now.’ Extra-time . looked inevitable until with the seconds ticking down, Derby sat back . for the first time.

"Steven Caulker has completed his move to QPR in an £8million deal from Cardiff City - after being convinced by the prospect of playing alongside Rio Ferdinand. The 22-year-old England international was allowed to travel to the London club for tests after Cardiff accepted an offer and he officially signed for the club on Tuesday. Crystal Palace had also matched the fee and offered wages of around £42,000 a week but QPR bettered those terms and convinced the former Tottenham defender that a move to Loftus Road, where he will figure alongside Ferdinand, can propel him back into the international fold.

'Being able to play with Rio Ferdinand was also a big draw. He has been a role model for many years, along with Ledley King. 'Our first aim this season has to be to get to 40 points, to make sure we stay up.' QPR are also poised to make their move for Troy Deeney of Watford. Leicester yesterday offered £6.5m but that has been rejected. A deal could be struck involving Leicester midfielder Andy King going the other way but Burnley and Swansea may yet re-enter the bidding for Deeney. Watford have been encouraged by Fulham agreeing to pay Leeds up to £11m for Ross McCormack and Leicester up to £10m for Brighton’s Leonardo Ulloa. Watford believe Deeney’s goalscoring record compares favourably with those two and hence will hold out for a similar price.

"You won’t know his name, but Brian Sollitt was the genius who brought a perfect ending to countless dinner parties and family  gatherings at Christmas. For more than half a century, the chocolatier and confectionery wizard beavered away in the kitchen of the Rowntree’s factory working on recipes and ideas for tantilising new treats. But his greatest achievement was the iconic After Eight mint – a middle-class essential of the 1960s but still popular in households across the land. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Brian Sollit referred to After Eight mints as the highlight of his career. Here he presents a giant version to parliament to mark the 50th anniversary in December 2012 . He was the head of the 'cream' department in 1962 when he was tasked with coming up with a new luxurious peppermint chocolate. The result was groundbreaking . Remarkably, this one man, who has died . aged 74, was also involved in bringing Yorkies, Matchmakers, Drifters . and Lion Bars to our sweetshop shelves. The . real-life Willy Wonka began his career  at the age of 15 when he was . recruited to the cream department with responsibility for hand piping . Black Magic chocolates. He was swiftly transferred to the Creme Experimentation Department to become a confectioner and an artisan of his trade. By . 1962, Mr Sollitt was head of the section tasked with coming up with a . new luxurious chocolate that was to be wrapped around a peppermint . fondant. Under a veil of secrecy, he was taken to one side by a senior executive and asked to create the wafer-thin mint. To . this day, the process he developed of preventing the liquid fondant . from oozing out of the chocolate casing is still an industry secret. His . creation has sold by the billions ever since and the Queen Mother was a . big fan of the mints. All . Mr Sollitt’s ideas and creations were taste-tested and refined before . going into mass production in the factory and despatched to corner shops . and newsagents in every town in the country. One of many creations: Mr Sollit created the super-chewy Lion bar, originally known as Big Cat . The Yorkie bar got its name from the city of York, where Rowntree's main factory is. Brian Sollit worked there for 53 years until his retirement six years ago . The wafer-thin chocolates wrapped around a peppermint fondant that took the market by storm . During . his 53 years at the factory Mr Sollitt was known for leaving seasonal . treats like chocolate Santas on a tray outside his office for workers to . take home. Born in 1938, his childhood was deprived of most chocolate and sugary sweets due to war-time rationing. But he joined the Quaker family company after leaving school and worked with chocolate all his life. Mr . Sollitt carried on collecting anything, from packaging to posters, that . was to do with his favourite After Eight sweet. And last year he came . out of retirement to make a giant three kilo version of the mint . chocolate to mark its 50th anniversary. Real-life Willy Wonka: Brian Sollit was compared to Roald Dahl's character Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Gene Wilder famously portrayed the character in a 1971 film . Alex . Hutchinson, the historian for Nestle which now owns Rowntree’s, said: . ‘Brian’s impact on the British confectionery industry is incalculable. ‘It . is easy to forget that the sweets we pick up in the shops today are . things that would have been handmade lovingly in the early stages of . development by Brian. ‘He . spent months, or sometimes years, agonising over the technical details . of his creations. He was an incredible man. He was asked to come up with . this new chocolate and he did.’ Mr . Sollitt also devoted much effort to raise money for charity. The . skilled chocolatier made  giant Easter Eggs and once made a 3ft . chocolate Pudsey Bear for  Children In Need. He . was also a brilliant teacher and trained many confectioners in their . craft. Most of all he was a very likeable ‘larger than life’ figure. ‘Everybody said you would hear him laughing and singing before you saw him,’ said Miss Hutchinson. Confectioner colleague Kath Musgrove added: ‘Watching Brian at work was like watching a true craftsman at his trade. ‘He spent hours at a marble slab expertly hand-covering chocolates each with their own individual markings on. ‘He was an ideas man and Brian bombarded the marketing team with his thoughts on what they should sell next. ‘He was instrumental over the years in assisting with the launch of many new products.’ Millions of After Eights are now made each year in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and sent to more than 50 countries. In keeping with his colourful character Mr Sollitt decorated his house with 500 Santas each year. He . said: ‘I still believe in Father Christmas. When I was young, my dad . used to make toys, so I loved Christmas time. Every surface in my house . is covered with Father Christmases, snowmen and lights. ‘I get them from all over the place. I couldn’t live with anybody, there’s no room.’ He also opened his house up for a £1 fee to raise money for charity. Mr Sollitt never married or had children. Friends said he was married to his job. After Eight mints were the higlight of Mr Sollit's career. They sky-rocketed in the market for posh after-dinner snacks and still pervade restaurant tables today. The Queen Mother was famously a fan of the iconic treats .","Brian Sollit worked for 53 years at the Rowntree's factory in York .

"37 Women filed a complaint against Occidental College saying officials mishandled their reports of rape or sexual abuse while students on the campus . Women say the exclusive college is indifferent to rape victims and hands out 'light' punishments to perpetrators . The school says it has implemented reforms and is calling in consultants . Sex crimes at a prestigious Los Angeles school, including rapes and sexual assaults were covered up and not taken seriously by the college's staff. On one occasion a student who was found responsible for raping a woman was given the punishment of writing a five-page book report. The federal complaint, which runs to 250 pages, against the Female Occidental College states that the school maintained a hostile environment when it came to sexual assault victims. Scroll down for video... Complaints: Attorney Gloria Allred is shown speaking with students and alumni who allege Occidental College administrators violated federal standards for dealing with their rape, sexual assault or retaliation claims . Attorney Gloria Allred said the complaint outlines violations of Title IX, which bars sex discrimination at schools. A group 37 women associated with the school consisting of both past and present students along with some professors, signed the complaint on Thursday. It has since been filed with the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights. They allege the college discouraged the reporting of sex crimes, proceeding with criminal action against the perpetrators and covered up rapes. In the complaint, Allred alleges that 37 students were 'raped, sexually assaulted, battered, harassed or retaliated against for speaking out against sexual violence.' Occidental College: Accused of mishandling rape and assault allegations . Getting off easy: Even when investigations have found wrongdoing, sometimes punishments have been as light as a five-page book report . 'I've seen some of the outputs of these so-called 'educational sanctions' like book reports and apology letters and they're abysmal,' told Danielle Dirks to the Huffington Post. Dirks is a sociology professor who specializes in crime and punishment who also signed the complaint. 'The fact that Occidental has invited rapists back to campus and even told survivors not to worry because 'he's reformed now' after these types of inadequate sanctions is an abomination.' A previous complaint was made against the school under the Clery Act alleging the school under-reports campus sexual assaults, discourages victims from reporting attacks and fails to issue timely crime reports. Jim Tranquada, the college director of communications responded: 'Sexual assault on college campuses is a nationwide problem, from which Occidental College regrettably is not exempt. We take this issue very seriously, and will not tolerate sexual misconduct.' 'We readily acknowledge that Oxy has more work to do, and are vigilantly ensuring our continual progress,' Tranquada said. The women who filed the complaint have been trying to encourage the college to improve their sexual assault policies for six years. Professor Dirks has said that when she became vocal about Oxy's sexual violence policies, administrators accused her of 'actively seeking to embarrass the college.' Review: A law firm is now reviewing Occidental College's practices. The school is a private college with an annual tuition around $60,000 . School statement: 'We take this issue exceptionally seriously and will not tolerate sexual misconduct.' Speaking to the LA Times, Senior Carly Mee said she was raped as a freshman. She said she reported the incident to the college but did not report it to police. A university panel found the alleged perpetrator responsible and initially expelled him. He then appealed and will now be able to re-enroll after she graduates in May. Los Angeles police say they have investigated three rape cases involving Occidental College students in the last three years, far fewer than current and former students outline in their civil rights complaint. The college does appear to be taking steps to redress their policies towards sexual violence and has hired a law firm to conduct a review. Occidental is a private college with an annual tuition around $60,000. President Barack Obama attended Occidental College for two years as an undergrad.","37 Women filed a complaint against Occidental College saying officials mishandled their reports of rape or sexual abuse while students on the campus .

"Scientology is heading for Harlem - with its new home to be located in a towering, multimillion-dollar brownstone slap bang in the middle of the neighborhood. The Church of Scientology and Community Center of Harlem, New York is part of an alleged mission to infiltrate new areas, targeting potential members who may not have heard some less than savory rumors about the organization. The building at 220 East 125th St, Dr Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard is set to open in the first half of 2014. Welcome to Harlem: The Church of Scientology is set to open a center at 220 East 125th Street in Harlem, New York next year . Presence: The multimillion-dollar building sits on Martin Luther King Boulevard in Harlem . A Church of Scientology International spokesperson told MailOnline: 'The Church of Scientology and our volunteers have been extremely active in Harlem for decades. 'And so it has been both the demand from parishioners as well as the community that we increase our work in Harlem. This brand new Church of Scientology and Community Center Harlem enables us to do so.' They did not reveal the cost for purchase of the building or the renovation. A spokesperson added that the center will be an 'Ideal Church of Scientology' - meaning provides full services of the religion. At the Harlem center will be a chapel for 200 people, a public information center and a dozen classrooms. There appears to be a move by the organization to add to its plethora of glitzy centers in places such as Silicon Valley, Orange County and Los Gatos, California with buildings in poorer, crime-ridden  areas. Critics suggest that the plan is to tap into parts of society that may be less aware of the negative associations of Scientology -  including reports of mind control and enforced manual labor by the church. Scientology has had a number of . troubles recently. Last month, actress Leah Remini defected from the . church and stirred controversy. The . King Of Queens star reported that the organization turned friends . against her and she filed a quickly-dismissed missing persons report . about leader David Miscavige's wife. Master plan: Scientology's leader David Miscavige is planning new branches of the church across the U.S. and world at large . Faithful famous followers: Church of Scientology's Celebrity Center in Los Angeles . Branching out: The Church of Scientology center in Inglewood, California . Trouble: Actress Leah Remini caused problems for Scientology when she defected in July . Andreas . Heldal-Lund, who runs anti-Scientology website Operation Clambake, told the New York Daily News: 'Scientology . is losing people. They are focusing on recruitment. 'They . are trying new avenues to find people who will pay for their truths.' Scientologists . turned out in their thousands to herald the opening of a new center of . Scientology in Inglewood, California back in 2011 - an area troubled by . violent gang culture. The Harlem Scientology center is due to open in 2014, as part of an aggressive construction schedule for centers of worship. Also on the schedule are centers in Albuquerque, Battle . Creek, Michigan; Boston, Chicago, Columbus and Philadelphia. Scientology, which was started in the 1950s, . is continuing its spread throughout the world. Centers are planned for Cape . Town, Durban and Harare in South Africa, Toronto and Montreal in Canada; . Bogotá in Colombia; Caracas in Venezuela, Copenhagen in Denmark; Sydney, Australia; Kaohsiung, Taiwan and Manchester, England - among many other large cities. Scientology centers are not the only construction being planned in the organization. MailOnline exclusively revealed this month photos of the Church of Scientology's 'alien space cathedral' built in a remote part of the New Mexico desert. The mysterious building leads to an underground vault which sits next to two giant symbols carved into the ground - believed to be markers for the religion's followers to find their way back from the ends of the universe after humanity is destroyed in the future. While no one knows the definite meaning of the pair of overlapping circles, each with a diamond in them, it is believed to have been trademarked by the Church of Technology, a branch of Scientology. It is believed that they are a ‘return point’ so members of the church know where they can find the works of founder L. Ron Hubbard when they come back from space after a nuclear catastrophe wipes out the human race.

"An Australian Muslim convert who boasts about being the third most 'liked' extremist preacher on Facebook, has announced he is travelling to Syria to join the jihad. Born Robert Cerantonio to an Italian father and a mother of Irish heritage, the former Catholic who is said to have renounced his Australian citizenship and has been living in the Philippines since 2013, posted on Twitter that he was heading to the war-torn country to join with his 'brothers' in the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). His message prompted a series of messages of support from his hardline followers, some of whom appeared to already be in Syria or Iraq. Scroll down for video . Musa Cerantonio, who is considered to be one of the most influential jihadist preachers in support of ISIS, has announced he is travelling to Syria . Cerantonio received overwhelming support from his followers on Twitter when he announced his travel plans . ‘Insha'Allah I will be arriving in Ash-Sham very shortly, keep us in your du'a, getting ready to travel,’ he posted on Wednesday, using the Arabic name for Syria. Cerantonio, who is known to use social media to recruit supporters for a worldwide jihad against the West and encourage Muslims to join ISIS, received an overwhelmingly positive response from his followers about his travel plans. Many comments wished him a safe trip while one excited supporter suggested ‘we'll go for the khilafahs finest falafel when you get here’. Some followers also expressed concern after Cerantonio, who is under investigation by the Australian Federal Police for inciting Australians to fight in Syria, had been inactive on Twitter over the past three weeks. ‘Nice to have you back among us brother, I was worried about you, I heard that the police was (sic) looking for you’ @moslima999 posted. A study conducted in early 2014 by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation found that one in four foreign fighters followed Cerantonio’s Twitter account and his Facebook page is the third-most ‘liked’ among jihadists. Cerantonio boasted about the Federal Government looking for him on his Facebook page on June 27. He gave an internet sermon sponsored by the now closed Islamic Al Risalah Bookstore in Sydney's Bankstown on April 2, 2013 in which he declared the 'crusaders and the Zionists' were the real terrorists, not Muslims. Cerantonio joked and boasted on his Facebook page about the Federal Police looking for him . ‘So apparently the Australian Federal Police are looking for me – Let’s see how well they can hunt,’ he said. ‘Have fun finding me, I’ll be waiting for you or whichever dogs you send.’ Follower, Salafi Manhaj, then joined in on the joke: ‘HAHAHAHA lol good luck for them. May Allah always keep you safe my dear beloved brother.' According to the Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium think tank, Cerantonio once said: ‘I do not doubt that I have called upon all believers, whether young or old, to respond to the commands of God.’ He added that such calls were made to unite the ranks of all Muslims ‘as one nation under the leadership of a Khalifah (spiritual and political head) who rules by Allah's Law.’ The Catholic who converted to Islam at 17, and is said to also speak Italian, used to host the live English-language TV show, Ask the Sheikh, from Egypt on which he answered viewers' questions about Islam. One in four foreign fighters follow Cerantonio's Twitter account and his Facebook page is the third-most 'liked' page among jihadists . Cerantonio has five siblings and two daughters, Aisha and Sophia, converted to Islam in 2002 after visiting the Vatican left him disillusioned with Catholicism. He was said to be particularly disgusted by Michelangelo's artwork on the roof of the Sistine Chapel – calling it 'idol worship'. 'And I felt in my heart that this, it's not right,' he said in a video titled, From Darkness To Light. 'Even though I've grown up being told this is what I'm supposed to believe, I reject it.' Cerantonio expressed his frustration about not being able to put his religious views into practice. 'Even though my family considered ourselves to be the truth we weren’t very practicing,' he said in 2011. 'Whilst we were Catholic and Christian by name, we didn’t really do much we didn’t go to church except on Christmas or Easter.' 'I used to loved hearing about all of the gods - I used to really love it and it would touch my heart however I never had the access of turning that love into action,' he said.

"Nicolas Anelka has announced he will tear up his contract with West Brom and leave the club over the fall-out from his infamous 'quenelle' goal celebration - but the Baggies claim the striker has not informed them yet, labelling the Frenchman 'unprofessional'. Anelka is on Saturday due to begin a five-match ban imposed for making the gesture, which has anti-Semitic links, after scoring against West Ham on December 28. An independent regulatory commission accepted there was no intent by Anelka to be anti-Semitic. But confusion remains over Anelka’s future as West Brom on Friday evening claimed they had received no formal resignation from him or his advisors and criticised him for issuing the statement on social media. Sacked: Nicolas Anelka had been supported by West Brom after his 'quenelle' gesture (above) but has now had his contract terminated . Fresh start: Anelka revealed earlier in the day via Social Media that he was terminating his contract . Friend: The gesture is linked to Anelka's friend, the controversial French comedian Dieudonne Mbala Mbala . Anelka's club opted not to appeal against the . sanction, and after holding talks with his employers the former France . striker wrote on Twitter: 'I have taken the decision to free myself and . put an end to the contract linking me with West Bromwich Albion.' Anelka claims he made the gesture in . support of his friend Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, a French comedian who has . been convicted seven times of anti-Semitic crimes. Following . the incident, Anelka started all four of Albion's Premier League games . in January. But he has not featured since and is banned for the upcoming . trips to Swansea, Hull and Norwich as well as home games against . Cardiff and Tottenham. Over . the course of three posts written in French on his official Twitter . account, Anelka wrote: . 'Following talks between the club and me, . propositions were made to me in order to reintegrate me into the squad . under certain conditions that I cannot accept. 'Wishing . to retain my integrity, I have therefore taken the decision to free . myself and put an end to the contract linking me with West Bromwich . Albion to 2014, with immediate effect.' Harsher: The FA argued for a more severe sanction than the five-match ban . Ban: Belgian futsal player Omar Rahou received a 10 match ban for the same gesture . But West Brom said in a statement that they had not heard from Anelka regarding the termination of his contract. The . club said: 'The club confirms it has been continuing discussions with . Nicolas Anelka and his advisers as part of its own internal enquiry into . the gesture he made after scoring against West Ham United on December . 28. 'Following the . conclusion of the FA's enquiry into the same incident, the club had . hoped to conclude its own investigations next week. 'The . club notes Nicolas Anelka's comments on Twitter this evening [Friday]. However, the club has received nothing formally regarding the . termination of Nicolas Anelka's contract from either him or his . advisers. 'The club regards . the release of such a statement on social media as highly . unprofessional and will make a further statement when appropriate.' Comparison: The panel looked at the Luis Suarez-Patrice Evra and John Terry-Anton Ferdinand cases when coming to their decision . Anelka . is only eligible for the Baggies' last five games of the season but the . club are yet to confirm the former Arsenal star's claims. On Thursday the Football Association decided . against appealing against the length of Anelka’s five-match ban, . issued by an independent commission for his anti-Semitic gesture. Anelka . is understood to have also accepted the ruling which means his . suspension now begins, starting with West Bromwich Albion’s match at . Swansea on Saturday. The FA . were considering an appeal to obtain an increase to the ban, which was . the minimum that could be handed out based on the governing body’s new . rules overseeing offences of a racist nature. West . Brom’s own investigation into the Frenchman’s actions is still ongoing, . with a conclusion expected next week. The club had not ruled out . sacking the player for his quenelle gesture. An . FA statement read: ‘Having carefully considered the written reasons of . the Independent Regulatory Commission together with our appointed QC, . The FA can confirm it will not be appealing the sanction imposed on . Nicolas Anelka. ‘The grounds . of appeal available to us are limited to legal challenges or to . circumstances in which the sanction imposed is “so unduly lenient as to . be unreasonable"". ‘As . the written reasons make clear, The FA pressed the Commission at the . original hearing to impose a suspension of greater than five matches. ‘We do not consider there is a real prospect of successfully appealing to extend the sanction imposed.’ An Independent Regulatory Commission found an aggravated breach of FA Rule E3 against Nicolas Anelka proven and issued a five-match suspension and a fine of £80,000, pending appeal. The West Bromwich Albion player was ordered to complete a compulsory education course. The Independent Regulatory Commission will provide written reasons for its decision in due course. Mr Anelka had the right to appeal the decision. Mr Anelka must notify The FA of his intention to appeal within seven days of receipt of the written reasons. The penalty is suspended until after the outcome of any appeal, or the time for appealing expires, or Mr Anelka notifies The FA of his decision not to appeal. Independent Regulatory Commission – summary of decision . 1. This is a written statement of the decision of The FA Regulatory Commission (chaired by independent Counsel Christopher Quinlan QC, Thura KT Win, Peter Powell) that sat on 25 and 26 February 2014 to consider charges brought against the player Nicolas Anelka (FA Disciplinary Regulation 9.1). 2.

"Nazis seized artwork: The painting is Shepherdess Bringing In Sheep, an 1886 work by French impressionist artist Camille Pissarro. It was stolen from Raoul Meyer, a Jewish businessman in Paris, during the Nazi occupation of France . A French woman is suing Oklahoma University in the hope of recovering painting stolen by Nazis. Her father used to own the painting until it was taken in the 1940s. The painting, Shepherdess Bringing In Sheep,is an 1886 work by French impressionist artist Camille Pissarro. The piece currently hangs in the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art. It was stolen from Raoul Meyer, a Jewish businessman in Paris, during the Nazi occupation of France. Now, Meyer's daughter, Leone Meyer, is suing OU in hopes of recovering the painting. The university has so far refused to . return the work, citing a previous court ruling in Switzerland that . denied the family's claim based on its timing. The fact that the Nazis . stole the painting is not in dispute. In . the 1940s, after Paris fell under Nazi control, German troops began . looting thousands of artworks from museums, galleries and personal . collections across France. Before . the German invasion of France, the Meyer family was part owner of . Groupe Galeries Lafayette, an upscale French department store. Raoul . Meyer amassed a large collection of French impressionist paintings. Raoul Meyer's art collection was seized during the Nazi occupation. After the war, Meyer, who survived the occupation, spent years trying to track down the artwork that had been stolen. Meanwhile, Shepherdess Bringing In Sheep changed hands several times. Captured: The painting was seized during the Nazi occupation of France in the 1940s. Now, the daughter of the former owner is suing to get the painting back into her family . On display: The piece currently hangs in the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art at the University Of Oklahoma . It's also not the first time the family have tried to recover the piece. n 1953, Meyer sued Christoph Bernoulli, a Swiss art dealer who had bought the painting, to tried to acquire it. A Swiss judge dismissed the suit, saying Meyer filed his complaint after a five-year window for such lawsuits had passed. The painting soon made its way to an art gallery in New York. Norman oilman Aaron Weitzenhoffer and his wife, Clara, bought the painting from the gallery in 1956. It was part of an extensive collection of impressionist art the couple amassed over decades. When Clara Weitzenhoffer died in 2000, 33 pieces of art were left to the OU museum. At the time, university officials said the collection, which included Shepherdess Bringing In Sheep, was one of the most important collections of French impressionist paintings given to an American public university. Unsure: Dawn St. Claire, Oklahoma City University Art Historian is unsure of the legal implications of the case given that a previous attempt to obtain the painting in the 1950s failed . Max Weitzenhoffer, the son of Aaron and Clara Weitzenhoffer, said his parents never knew about the painting's connections to Nazi art theft, but encouragingly said he didn't know of any provision in his mother's will preventing the university from returning the painting to the Meyer family. OU officials have questioned whether the university is legally required to return the painting. In fact, the university's is arguing that the dismissal of the family's 1953 lawsuit in Switzerland should bar the family from making the same claim 60 years later. Dawn St. Clare, an art history professor at Oklahoma City University, said cases where museums and other public institutions find out they own artworks that were stolen by the Nazis are relatively common. Ms. St. Clare argues that that the painting offers a difficult set of ethical challenges, especially where a painting's owners bought the work in good faith, as the Weitzenhoffers family had. In those cases, there's no established code of ethics for what a museum should do, especially since details can vary widely from one case to the next. 'Where do you place blame? I don't know,' she said. 'I really don't know.'","Painting was stolen from Meyer family during the 1940s when the Nazi's occupied France .

"A 'terrorist' with strong British links has been arrested in connection with a foiled 'plot' to assassinate Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Dramatic television footage showed half-naked and evidently wounded Chechen Adam Osmayev seized by special forces in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odessa. On his knees, his head bowed, he said in an alleged confession: 'Our goal was to go to Moscow and try to kill Prime Minister Putin... Our deadline was after the Russian presidential election.' Scroll down for video . Chechen suspect: Dramatic footage aired on Russian TV today showed a half-naked and wounded Adam Osmayev seized by special forces in Odessa, Ukraine, earlier this month, when he was arrested in connection with a foiled 'plot' to assassinate Vladimir Putin . UK links: The Russian security services have previously claimed that Osmayev was 'a graduate of a prestigious institution of higher learning in Great Britain', and is from a prominent Chechen family opposed to Putin . 'Confession': Osmayev, with the wounds on his face coated in iodine, is led to a questioning cell in an unknown Russian detention centre. He has been on Russia's . wanted list for a number of years . Security operation: Osmayev was seized when forces stormed a property in Odessa on February 4 (pictured) The Russian security services have . previously claimed that Osmayev was 'a graduate of a prestigious . institution of higher learning in Great Britain', and is from a . prominent Chechen family opposed to Putin. Shown on Russian state-run TV with . his hands bandaged and wounds on his face, Osmayev has been on Russia's . wanted list for a number of years. He is believed to have lived 'for . many years' in London, which, if true, will inflame Russian concerns . that Britain is a safe haven for alleged Islamic extremist terrorist . suspects from Chechnya. The arrests of two suspects was made . by the Ukrainian special services anti-terrorist unit Alfa after an . accidental explosion early last month in an Odessa apartment which . killed a third alleged terrorist, Ruslan Madayev. The revelation comes in the final . week of campaigning for Sunday's presidential election which Putin is . virtually certain to win convincingly despite recent opposition street . protests against his authoritarian rule. Plot: Released today by the Russian authorities, this January 4 photo shows the aftermath of an explosion in another apartment in Odessa. Two people were detained and one killed in the blast which officials claim is linked to Osmayev's arrest . Damaged interior: Ukrainian Security Service said it detained three Russian citizens on terrorist charges in Odessa a month after the explosion . Russia's Channel One TV station claimed the suspects were plotting to kill Putin in Moscow immediately after Sunday's presidential election, in which he is all but certain to reclaim the presidency . Security threat: Another suspected militant, Ilya Pyanzin, also appeared to 'confess' on Russian television . Foiled: On Osmayev's laptop was found hidden camera footage of Putin's motorcade in Moscow, and it is believed this was to be the target of the assassination bid. Here, the PM can be seen wearing a white shirt . 'We are going different ways': A protester holds a poster of Vladimir Putin in Moscow yesterday . Osmayev, believed to be 30, and . fellow gang members were on a mission ordered by Chechnya's most wanted . rebel leader Doku Umarov, it was claimed. In January last year, Umarov targeted . passengers emerging from British flights at a Moscow airport. A total . of 37 died and 180 were injured. His goal is an Islamic state based on Chechnya and run under Sharia law in the tinderbox Caucasus region. The alleged plotters, all ethnic . Chechens, came to Ukraine from the United Arab Emirates via Turkey with . 'clear instructions from representatives of Doku Umarov', it was . claimed. On Osmayev's laptop was found hidden . camera footage of Putin's motorcade in Moscow, and it is believed this . was to be the target of the assassination bid. Footage was shot 'so that we had an . understanding of how he was protected', said Osmayev, who allegedly . planned to use military mines to assassinate the premier. 'The end goal was to come to Moscow . and to try to stage an assassination attempt against premier Putin,' he . said. 'The deadline was after the election of the Russian president.' Russia's Channel One television . station said the suspect had revealed to investigators the site of a . cache of explosives already in place near Kutuzovsky Prospekt, a major . Moscow highway used daily by Putin in a heavily-armoured limousine to go . to and from work. An FSB official said the explosives would have created 'a serious blast, powerful enough to tear apart a truck'. The British-educated man is co-operating with Ukrainian interrogators hoping that this will avoid his extradition to Russia. Unity: More than 30,000 peaceful protesters held hands to form a ten-mile human chain around central Moscow . Determined: The demonstrators want to keep up the pressure on Putin as he prepares to extend his rule for six more years . Another suspect Ilya Pyanzin, who had . a Kazakh passport, said: 'They told us that first you come to Odessa . and learn how to make bombs. 'And then later, in Moscow, you will . stage attacks against commercial objects, with the subsequent . assassination attempt against Putin.' The existence of the plot was . confirmed by Putin's spokesman as well as the Ukrainian Security Service . (SBU) and its Russian counterpart the Federal Security Service (FSB). 'I confirm this information but am not commenting now,' said Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov. News of the arrests comes a day after . thousands of protesters held hands to form a ten-mile human chain . around Moscow city centre. Across the country: Supporters of the opposition protest took to the streets of St Petersburg yesterday . Determined: A man holds a poster of Putin wearing a crown that reads 'Down with autocracy' during the St Petersburg rally . Some analysts were suspicious of the . timing of the assassination bid report since the first arrest was made . on January 4 and the second - Osmayev - on February 4.  They claimed the . incident was being used for political reasons to overshadow protests . about Putin. 'It just seems like an incredible . coincidence that these monsters were discovered today,' said independent . military analyst Alexander Golts. 'From now on, anyone who is against . the prospects of Putin's election as president will be put on the same . playing field as the terrorists.' Opposition leaders also reacted with scepticism. Opposition parliamentarian Gennady Gudkov said: 'Without a doubt there is always . information about preparations or attempted terrorist attacks. But what . does it really mean that (news of) this assassination attempt appears . today? The timing was certainly political.' Another opposition leader, Vladimir Ryzhkov, said that 'assassination attempts are the favourite tactic of dictators'. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov . dismissed such allegations as 'inappropriate' given the 'real threats . for Putin's security'. On Monday Putin, 59, chaired a meeting on arms . trade in his residence outside Moscow. Allegations of widespread fraud in a parliamentary election on December 4 have angered many liberals and nationalists in Moscow and St Petersburg, and some Russians are alarmed that he could rule Russia for another 12 years if he wins two more terms. Previous reports of assassination attempts have rarely made a big impact in Russia. The FSO spokeswoman said such attempts had taken place but declined to specify. In one of the incidents, a sniper was widely reported to have been preparing to shoot at Putin and his ally, President Dmitry Medvedev, as they walked outside the Kremlin after Medvedev's victory in the 2008 presidential election. Putin has remained the more powerful of the two, despite stepping aside to become premier in 2008 because of constitutional limits. Russia has a long history of assassinations. Tsar Alexander II was killed by a bomb in 1881 and Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin was shot in a theatre in 1911. A plot to kill Soviet dictator Josef Stalin along with the British and U.S. leaders was foiled in 1943, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev was shot at in 1969, and Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin survived several attempts to kill him. An attempt on President Boris Yeltsin's life was reported in 1993. But no acting Soviet head of party, state or government was assassinated, and no Russian president or prime minister has been assassinated since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.

"Asylum: Banker Andrei Borodin is wanted on criminal charges in Moscow but has been granted asylum by the Home Office . A Russian banking tycoon who owns Britain’s most expensive house has been given asylum in this country – prompting fury in Moscow. Andrey Borodin, 45, fled his homeland two years ago accusing the Kremlin of politically- motivated persecution. He bought the £140million grade II listed mansion called Park Place, near Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire, where he lives with his family. But his presence in Britain has angered the Russian authorities who want him extradited to stand trial for alleged fraud. Mr Borodin says the charges were trumped up when he dared to accuse a key ally of President Vladimir Putin of corruption. Mr Borodin’s lawyer confirmed he had been granted refugee status in the UK, meaning the Government has accepted he could be harmed by the Russian state if sent home. The decision will further undermine Britain’s strained relations with Moscow, with the office of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev issuing an angry response. The Russian leader’s press secretary Natalya Timakova said the accusations against Mr Borodin, were fully justified. ‘There is now a practice of seeking political asylum,  especially in England, whereby it doesn’t matter what the seeker has done,’ she said. ‘What  matters is how loudly he shouts about political persecution.’ While the Home Office did not comment, Borodin's lawyer in Moscow,  Dmitry Kharitonov, said: 'Yes, he got political asylum in Britain. This status is not time-limited.' In October it was revealed that the fugitive had been the target of a surveillance operation on the M4 close to his home.  'It might have been someone from the Russian security service, it might have been criminals,' he said at the time. He bought the £140million grade II listed mansion called Park Place, near Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire, where he lives with his family . His presence in Britain has angered the Russian authorities who want him extradited to stand trial for alleged fraud. He is pictured here with girlfriend Tatiana . Russia has put Borodin on its international wanted list and strongly denies claims that Medvedev or anyone else sought to persecute the banker. The Russian premier's press secretary Natalya Timakova said today that the accusations against Borodin - who fled to London in April 2011 - are of 'pure criminal character' involving Bank of Moscow, which he formerly owned. She issued what is expected to be the first blast of many from Moscow on this asylum case. 'There now a practice of seeking the political asylum - specially in England - whereby it doesn't matter what the seeker has done,' she said. 'What matters is how loudly he shouts about political persecution - and this will become a guarantee that the asylum will be granted.' She accused Britain of ignoring that Interpol 'is after him'. Moscow also insisted today that it would continue to demand Borodin's extradition from Britain. But he claimed today: 'Any political asylum seeker must submit the application together with recordings and any other proof showing the political character of the persecution in his native country. My lawyers submitted all necessary proof.' Borodin claimed that he was ousted from the bank because it was needed as a 'pension pot' for Medvedev.  He alleged he was forced to sell his stake in the bank for £465 million, which he claimed was half its true value. He fled Russia after being told he faced a probe into corruption involving loans at the bank, accusations he claims are trumped up. Russia has put Borodin on its international wanted list and strongly denies claims that Medvedev or anyone else sought to persecute the banker . Borodin in accused of improperly loaning £285 million to shell companies which switched the money to Yelena Baturina, wife of long-time Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who was ousted by Medvedev.  She, too, is now based mainly in London and denies wrongdoing. The banker claimed there was a political decision to take control over the Bank of Moscow, and that it was executed by VTB president Andrei Kostin and Igor Yusufov,  a special representative of the then President Medvedev. 'Yusufov told me straight forwardly that he was acting at the order and in interests of Medvedev, who decided to gain state control over the Bank of Moscow,' he said. Yusufov claimed a 'future financial empire' was being created for Medvedev,  who he nicknamed the 'young man', a term supposedly relating to his second-fiddle status to Vladimir Putin.  Yusufov dismissed the claims against him as 'lies and slander'. Bank of Moscow was taken over by state-controlled VTB bank in a $14 billion bailout in July 2011, the biggest rescue in Russian financial history. The Russian authorities blame Borodin for its problems. Borodin was listed as 117th richest person in Russia by Forbes-2012 with an estimated fortune of $800 million.","Andrey Borodin, 45, fled homeland 2 years ago amid 'political persecution'

"Representing her nation: Sarah Attar will be the London Games .

Victory Park in the Olympic Village: Competing in the Olympics is such a huge step for women in Saudi Arabia, they are happy to abide by the strict caveats laid out by their country's leaders . In Saudi Arabia when in public women are required to wear a black abaya and head scarf by law. They are banned from driving their own cars and they are not permitted to run their own businesses. Women are also not allowed inside main government buildings. Travel is very difficult for women in Saudra Arabia. Regardless of their age, they are not allowed to travel abroad without official permission from their guardians, which has to be authorised by the government. Two years ago lingerie shops were staffed by men which could prove awkward when women had to discuss underwear sizing with the men. But it's a year of change and women are now allowed to work in malls as sales clerks in lingerie shops thanks to several campaigns both by officials such as the past labour minister Ghazi Algosaibi and activists such as Reem Asaad. 'There must also be no mixing with men during the Games,' he added. 'The athlete and her guardian must pledge not to break these conditions,' he said. It comes after months of talks - with Saudi Olympic chiefs at one point insisting no women would be allowed to take part. IOC . president Jacques Rogge described their entry, confirmed by the Saudi . Arabian Olympic Committee ahead of the July 9 deadline, as 'very . positive news'. He said: . 'The IOC has been working very closely with the Saudi Arabian Olympic . Committee and I am pleased to see that our continued dialogue has come . to fruition. 'The IOC has . been striving to ensure a greater gender balance at the Olympic Games, . and today’s news can be seen as an encouraging evolution. 'With Saudi Arabian female athletes . now joining their fellow female competitors from Qatar and Brunei . Darussalam, it means that by London 2012 every National Olympic . Committee will have sent women to the Olympic Games.' Qatar . and Brunei, two other countries that have never sent any female . athletes to the Olympics, are also including women on their teams for . the London Games. With the Saudis now following suit, . it means all national teams competing in the games will include female . athletes for the first time in Olympic history. About 10,500 athletes are expected to compete in London, representing more than 200 national Olympic committees. Saudi Arabia has been under pressure . from the International Olympic Committee and human-rights groups to . include women athletes. The IOC has been in negotiations with the Saudis for months on securing the participation of women. They said the two Saudi athletes were entered by the Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee by the official deadline of July 9. Adherence: In Saudi Arabia when in public women are required to wear a black abaya and head scarf by law . Rights groups hailed the decision as a . step forward for Saudi women in their quest for basic rights in a . country that severely restricts them in public life. 'It's . an important precedent that will create space for women to get rights . and it will be hard for Saudi hardliners to roll back,' said Minky . Worden of the New York-based Human Rights Watch. Good news: IOC president Jacques Rogge described their entry as 'very positive news' In the Saudi city of Jeddah, Mariam Alawi, a housewife in her 20s, said: 'This is fantastic news and it's about time. Maybe now people in Saudi can see that females are capable of taking the reins. The world already knows that women can do great things - maybe now Saudi can know that too.' Hashim Adnan, a 28-year-old Saudi man who works at an investment firm in Jeddah, said the athletes were likely to face ""heavy criticism"" in the country, but that the government should support them.Saudi King Abdullah has a reputation as a cautious reformer and supporter of women's rights. Last year he announced plans to allow women to vote in municipal council elections and join the consultative Shoura council. The country's official sports body, the General Presidency of Youth Welfare, only caters to male athletes and women do not take part in sports at state schools. So women athletes have to fund themselves and arrange their own training, mostly abroad. A Saudi official told Reuters earlier this week Saudi women participating in the Olympics would have to obey the dress code of Islamic law. He did not elaborate, but other conservative Muslim countries have interpreted this to mean a headscarf, long sleeves and long pants. Saudi Arabia is one of three countries, alongside Brunei and Qatar, never to have sent female athletes to the Olympics but the latter two confirmed earlier this year that their delegations would include women. Brunei has entered Maziah Mahusin (athletics), while Qatar has entered Nada Arkaji (swimming), Noor Al-Malki (athletics), Aya Magdy (table tennis) and Bahiya Al-Hamad (shooting), who will also be her country's flagbearer at the opening ceremony.

"Sportsmail has launched a campaign to stamp out the wrestling, grappling and shirt pulling in the penalty area that's ruining our game. Here's what they're all saying about it in the world of football: . Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo both appear to grapple Branislav Ivanovic and John Terry of Chelsea . John Terry - Chelsea captain . ‘Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.’ Colin Pascoe - Liverpool assistant manager . ‘Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees’ interpretation and we’ll leave it to them. That’s what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it’s in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn’t have to mark anyone.’ Ian Wright, ex-Arsenal striker . ‘There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.’ Graham Poll - Former top referee . ‘Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.’ Martin Keown - Ex-Arsenal defender . ‘Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.’ Martin Keown developed a strategy for dealing with players like Nesta when he encountered them with Arsenal . Micky Mellon - Shrewsbury Town manager . ‘In a congested area how can you judge if someone’s been blocked? It’s part of the game and some people are good at it. It’s football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. “Can you show me some blocking techniques?” That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won’t be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.’ Ryan Shawcross of Stoke was rightly penalised for wrestling Swansea striker Wilfried Bony to the ground during last weekend's match at the Britannia Stadium . And the readers of MailOnline... ‘It’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.’ Willdajack, Neath . ‘To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop.

"Springboks talisman Victor Matfield has hailed Ireland captain Paul O'Connell as 'the best player I've played against'. Veteran lock Matfield admitted boss Heyneke Meyer's side must be wary of Ireland's lineout and driving maul in Saturday's autumn Test at Dublin's Aviva Stadium. The 37-year-old Springbok retired after the 2011 World Cup, but was enticed back after a two-year break, since returning to action for both club and country. Ireland lock Paul O'Connell (left) is the 'best player' who South Africa star Victor Matfield has played against . Matfield (left) talks with South Africa kicking coach Louis Koen during training ahead of Saturday's game . Blue Bulls second row Matfield believes Munster enforcer O'Connell will once again prove central to Ireland's tight work, under new forwards coach Simon Easterby. 'I think he (O'Connell) is a fantastic player, I think he's probably the best player I've played against in my career,' said Matfield. 'He is also a student of the lineout. 'You can see he puts in a lot of hours in analysing, preparing and getting his whole unit ready for the weekend. 'So it is always tough going up against him.' Ireland are missing pack mainstays Cian Healy and Sean O'Brien to long-term injury, with the fast-improving Marty Moore also absent and Mike Ross battling to be fit for the weekend. O'Connell and Devin Toner are Ireland's shoo-in starting locks, with Iain Henderson and Dan Tuohy sidelined. O'Connell led the British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa in 2009 but they were unsuccessful . Head coach Joe Schmidt must also do without prop Nathan White, who was in line for his debut but damaged a biceps tendon in training. Matfield drew on all his 117-cap experience in predicting a gritty tussle up front with Ireland, despite Saturday's hosts clear injury issues. The wily operator also launched the first charm offensive towards French referee Romain Poite, who will officiate the weekend's Test clash. Last season opponents often questioned the legality of Ireland's highly-effective tactics at stopping rolling mauls. Former forwards coach John Plumtree whipped Ireland's pack into accurate shape in diffusing opposition mauls, with officials mainly judging them the right side of the laws. Matfield picked up that theme in making an early call for the Springboks to take care to be water-tight with their own driving game. South African lock Matfield (centre) believes his side will face a tough test against Ireland at the Aviva . 'I also think when Gert Smal (ex-Ireland forwards' coach) was here he gave a lot of insight into how I think about the lineout to Paul, so it makes it more difficult,' said Matfield. 'It is always a great battle against him and he has some great jumpers with him in that unit so we know it's going to be very tough. 'Like I said, we know we have to be accurate in what we do because they will definitely put pressure on us. 'The rolling maul is very important to us: looking at them as well, they were very successful in sacking the maul during the Six Nations, especially. 'They stopped it very well, so we know we need to do our things right and hopefully the referee (Romain Poite) will be very strict on how to stop the maul. 'If we do our things right it is a lot easier for the ref to see if they are stopping the maul legally or not. 'It's important for us to get our set-up right, to get it started and from then it is easier.'","Ireland host South Africa at Dublin's Aviva Stadium on Saturday .

"We've all heard about people doing strange things for love, but Japanese students are taking love-induced madness to a whole new level - and putting their health at risk in the process. The latest craze sweeping through Japan is ‘oculolinctus’ – eyeball licking as an expression of affection between young lovers. However, it has led to a surge in cases of eye infections and can even cause blindness, doctors have warned. Scrolll down for video . The latest craze among students is 'oculolinctus' - eyeball licking as an expression of affection between young lovers . The bizarre fetish, which is also known as ‘worming’, was uncovered by the Japanese website, Naver Matome, which revealed that videos of eyeball licking have been posted on YouTube. But eyeball licking has not only taken off in Japan. Elektrika Energias, 29, a student in the U.S. Virgin Islands told The Huffington Post: ‘My boyfriend started licking my eyeballs years ago and I just loved it. ‘I'm not with him anymore, but I still like to ask guys to lick my eyeballs. I just love it because it turns me on, like sucking on my toes. It makes me feel all tingly.’ However, the practice is not without its dangers – it can transmit the bacteria which causes conjunctivitis, Medical Daily reports. If the person doing the eyeball licking has the herpes virus, that can be passed on as well. Naver Matome discovered that the craze . came to the attention of one school in Japan when it was noticed that up . to ten children in each class arrived at lessons wearing eye patches. It has led to a surge in cases of eye infections, such as conjunctivitis, and can even cause blindness . The school also discovered that a third of its 12-year-old pupils admitted to engaging in the practice. ‘Nothing good can come of this,’ Dr David Granet, a San Diego ophthalmologist, told The Huffington Post. ‘There are ridges on the tongue that can cause a corneal abrasion. And if a person hasn't washed out their mouth, they might put acid from citrus products or spices into the eye.’ Dr Phillip Rizzuto, from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, added that eyeball licking can cause blindness as the bacteria found in the mouth can damage eye tissue.","'Oculolinctus' is performed as expression of intimacy .

"Accusations: It has been claimed that Peter and Louise Mensch were long embroiled in an adulterous affair before they got married . A British politician has been accused of having a 20-year extramarital affair with an American rock band manager who she went on to marry. The family of Melissa Meyer have accused ex-Conservative MP Louise Mensch - née Bagshawe - of having an illicit relationship with Peter Mensch while he was still married to American Melissa. Ms Meyer's family have voiced . suspicions that the couple had a 20-year affair when they were both married – . Peter to Melissa, and Louise to U.S. businessman Anthony LoCicero. The two women now live in close proximity in Manhattan after Louise, 41, dramatically announced she was resigning her parliamentary seat in England and moved into a mansion on the Upper West Side with Peter. Melissa, a 44-year-old former school teacher, remains in the $7million Greenwich Village townhouse she once shared with her husband. The likelihood of the two women peacefully coexisting seems especially remote after the startling claim by the family of Melissa, known as Missy, that Peter and Louise were long embroiled in an adulterous affair. Louise, who was a chick-lit author before becoming a politician, married Peter in June 2011. It followed his divorce from Melissa in December 2010. Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Melissa’s sister-in-law Laura Meyer said the family believe the affair began when Louise, then an undergraduate at Oxford University, invited then 37-year-old Peter to the union to talk about the music industry. ‘I feel it is important to make public our suspicions Louise was having a relationship with Peter which we believe dates back to when she was 18 or 19 years old,’ said Ms Meyer. ‘When Missy found out in August 2009 they had been involved in an affair, she was devastated.’ Last week, Peter, 59, said that their love blossomed in 2009, after Louise separated from Anthony. Peter was still married to Melissa, but says Louise told him she had loved him for 20 years. Asked if they had an affair before that, he said: ‘Hmmm .  .  . no.’ They stayed in touch after their first meeting in 1990. Louise has credited Peter with helping her land a job with record label EMI. Mr Mensch, 59, manages rock acts including Def Leppard and Metallica. The same year, Peter married Melissa, his second wife. The couple have 17-year-old twins Eli and Hannah, and a daughter Jona, 16. In 1995, Louise dedicated her novel Career Girls to Peter, thanking him ‘for taking me along for the ride’. In it, Rowena, a ‘blonde’ and . ‘beautiful’ British woman – educated at Louise’s old Oxford college, . Christ Church – has a long affair with a married, older Jewish-American . music tycoon. He eventually dumps his wife for Rowena. The book features . a brash American called ‘Marissa’. Louise married Anthony in 2000. They had three children, but in May 2009 she announced their separation. The Mail on Sunday has established that Louise declared her love for Peter in February 2009 at a Metallica gig. Peter admitted to an affair and . requested a divorce. ‘Missy did everything to save the marriage,’ said . her brother Fred. The family said she was ‘creeped out’ by the parallels . in Career Girls. Standing down: In August, Louise, 41, dramatically announced she was resigning her seat in Corby, Northamptonshire . Peter refused to discuss the claim of an affair with Louise, saying: ‘I don’t talk about my ex-wife and I don’t talk about Louise. I’m not going to discuss my personal life.’ Melissa signed a gagging order as part of her divorce. Mrs Mensch, who has set up a social networking site in the States called Menshn, is aspiring to a TV career in the U.S. The new Mrs Mensch, the daughter of a wealthy stockbroker and a headmistress, shares custody of her children with her former husband Anthony. Their split in 2009 cited 'enormous stress'. At the time, friends said no one else was involved in the separation. Six months later, she and Mr Mensch went on their first date, he told the Mail in 2011. When the pair did marry, they kept it a secret, not even telling Ms Mensch's three children.","The startling claim made by family of Peter Mensch's ex-wife .

"The national civil-rights group American Atheists has launched a new billboard campaign in Salt Lake City with a play on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints’ (LDS) ‘I’m a Mormon’ campaign, to promote its upcoming national convention. The billboard features a native Utah family and reads: ‘We’re the Monnett family, and We’re Atheists,’ with the words ‘Mormons’ and ‘ex-Mormons’ crossed out. The board, placed in the Mormon heartland, encourages people to ‘Come explore your doubt with us’. The American Atheists strongly believe that ex-Mormons should not continue to base their identity in Mormonism . American Atheists President David Silverman said: ‘Many atheists still call themselves Mormons or ex-Mormons. Our message is this: If you don’t believe anymore, don’t continue to base your identity in Mormonism. ‘You’re so much more than an “ex-Mormon”; you’re an atheist! And you are very far from alone. Be proud to be an atheist - we are, and we want to celebrate being an atheist with you. He added: ‘American Atheists is reaching out to people who are on a journey away from indoctrination, even if they’re not ready to be open about that. Strong views: The previous American Atheists billboard was harder hitting . The American Atheist billboard is based on the 'I'm a mormon' ad campaign . ‘Countless Utahns are already free from religion but remain “in the closet” about their beliefs. They are surrounded by religion and as a result, feel like they are alone. ‘The National Convention will fix that by creating a fun and entertaining atmosphere where atheists from all over the country will meet, learn, and laugh. We invite everyone - especially those who have doubts about their religion -to join us.’ In designing the ad, American Atheists sought a genuine Utah atheist family to appear on the billboard. Overwhelmed with responses, the group chose the Monnetts of South Jordan. West Monnett, a sports coach and stay-at-home dad, and his wife, Lennie, a director in finance, are both atheists who used to identify as ex-Mormons. Their children, Bentley and Tallen, as well as their niece, McKayla (of whom West and Lennie are guardians), are also featured on the billboard. McKayla’s mother, Melinda Dayley, has accused some atheist groups of needlessly attacking religious organisations and is not entirely supportive of her daughter appearing on the billboard. She told The Salt Lake Tribune that she’s ‘not very happy’ about McKayla’s inclusion and added: ‘I have friends that are atheists … but they’re not out there knocking our beliefs. West is the type that has to go out and prove a point. He’s always been that kind of person.’ However, the latest billboard is considered to be less incendiary than its predecessor, which read ‘God Is A Space Alien. Baptizes Dead People. Big Money, Big Bigotry’. The 2014 National Convention will feature speakers including NFL star Chris Kluwe, Survivor: Philippines winner Denise Stapley, and Grammy-nominated Spin Doctors bass player Mark White, all atheists themselves, but none of whom have ever before spoken for an atheist audience. Other speakers include Reverend Barry Lynn of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, Maryam Namazie of the Council of ex-Muslims, popular bloggers PZ Myers and Greta Christina, and American Atheists President David Silverman. The billboard is located on the east side of I-15, 2500 feet south of 33rd Road South, facing north.","The billboard features a native Utah family and reads 'We're the Monnett family, and We're Atheists'

"The massive horns of Triceratops evolved over more than a million years, a study shows. A study of 50 skulls dug up at the Hell Creek Formation - a famous fossil site in Montana - found the beast underwent change over a very long period of time. Older fossils lying deeper in the rock had shorter horns than the younger specimens nearer the surface, say scientists. This Triceratops fossil came from the middle of the Hell Creek Formation. It is displayed at MSU's Museum of the Rockies. Older fossils lying deeper in the rock had shorter horns than the younger specimens nearer the surface, say scientists. By recording precise stratigraphic information for each Triceratops, and analyzing the morphological details of the skull, it appears possible to see evolutionary trends in Triceratops, the researchers said. Over one to two million years at the end of the Cretaceous Period, Triceratops went from having a small nasal horn and long beak to having a long nasal horn and shorter beak. The dinosaur with a small nasal horn and long beak is a Triceratops horridus. It was only found lower in the Hell Creek Formation. The dinosaur with a long nasal horn and shorter beak is a Triceratops prorsus. It was only found near the top of the Hell Creek Formation.  Skulls found in the middle of the Hell Creek Formation showed characteristics of both Triceratops horridus and Triceratops prorsus. The findings published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggest Triceratops horridus took between one and two million years to evolve into Triceratops prorsus. In the past it was believed the two species might have existed at the same time. Triceratops, which lived 65 million years ago, was a giant plant-eating creature best known for its great bony head frill and three horns - one above each eye and a small stubby one above its beak-like mouth. An adult could grow to about 30ft long and weigh five tons. Dr John Scanella, of the Museum of the Rockies, and colleagues said: 'The placement of over 50 skulls of the well-known horned dinosaur Triceraptops within a stratigraphic framework for the Upper Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation reveals the evolutionary transformation of this genus.' Triceratops - Greek for 3-horned face - has been described as a reptilian knight that carried two lances and a shield on top of its enormous head. A Triceratopcs prorsus fossil came from the top of the Hell Creek Formation. It has a long nasal horn and shorter beak is a Triceratops prorsus. The horns grew up to 3 feet long and the forward curvature marked their owners as sexually mature. The bony frill changed with age as well. In juveniles the edge was adorned with triangular bones resembling arrowheads. These flattened as the animal got older and were barely visible in adults. It had a huge, barrel-like body and short tail. It’s believed Triceratops used its horns as weapons against predators like T rex and also for mate attraction - much like colourful feathers in birds. Some Triceratops specimens show healed wounds in their skull or frill - showing they fought among themselves. They may have fought over females, territory or leadership. This image shows the evolution of the Triceratops in the Hell Creek Formation of Eastern Montana . It had a very long and powerful beak. Each jaw had closely packed teeth with a broad grinding surface. With its scissor-like beak and grinding teeth Triceratops was able to bite off and chew even the toughest plants. Dr Scanella said: 'Our research indicates the currently recognised species of Triceraptops - T horridus and T prorsus - are stratigraphically separated and the evolution of this genus likely incorporated transformational change. 'These findings impact interpretations of dinosaur diversity at the end of the Cretaceous and illuminate potential modes of evolution in the Dinosauria.' Over the course of the project, the researchers found that Triceratops is the most common dinosaur in the Hell Creek Formation. The Museum of the Rockies now houses one of the largest collections of Triceratops in the world. 'Most dinosaurs are only known from one or a handful of specimens,' Scannella said. 'Some dinosaurs are known from a large number of specimens, but they’re often found all in one place – on a single stratigraphic horizon. 'The great thing about Triceratops is that there are a lot of them, and they were found at different levels of the Hell Creek Formation. 'The new study finds evidence that not only did Triceratops change shape over the lifetime of an individual, but that the genus transformed over the course of the end of the age of dinosaurs.'","Study of 50 skulls were dug up at the Hell Creek Formation in Montana .

"Ten thousand scientologists are expected to descend on Clearwater, Florida this weekend for the grand opening of a 'cathedral' which has been under construction for 15 years. The $145million Flag Building is a massive seven-story, 377,000-square-foot complex and the tallest building in Clearwater, which is the 'spiritual headquarters' of the 59-year-old religion. The opening of the building on Sunday will mark the first time Scientologists have had a space to receive 'Super Power' training - a program developed by the religion's founder L Ron Hubbard in the 1970s. Grand opening: Scientology's Flag Building in Clearwater, Florida is set to open this Sunday . Celebration: Most of this weekend's activities will take place in a gigantic tent erected near the building . The Super Power course was developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and  promises to boost a person's perceptions or senses through a series of mental and physical tasks. Scientologists believe that in addition to the five senses of hearing, sight, touch, taste and smell we have 57 additional abilities known as 'perceptics'. These include an ability to sense blood circulation, balance, compass direction, temperature, gravity as well as an 'awareness of importance, unimportance.' In his writings Hubbard described the course as: 'A superfantastic, but confidential series of rundowns that can be done on anyone whether Dianetic clear or not that puts the person into fantastic shape unleashing the super power of a thetan. 'This is the means that puts Scientologists into a new realm of ability enabling them to create the new world. It puts world clearing within reach in the future. 'It consists of 12 separate high-power rundowns which are brand-new and enter realms of the tech never before approached.' Hubbard had originally wanted to offer the course in 1978 but many of his staff who had been through the instructor training left the church on completion of the course. In a written statement, church spokesman Ben Shaw said: 'Super Power is a series of spiritual counseling processes designed to give a person back his own viewpoint, increase his perception, exercise his power of choice, and greatly enhance other spiritual abilities.' The group broke ground on the Mediterranean Revival-style  building in 1998, but stopped work after finishing the shell. For three years, the group ceased construction on the project until the city started imposing $250-a-day fines for code violations. Scientology defectors have explained that the building's slow construction is due to church leader's who have used the project as a fundraising cash cow. An analysis by the Tampa Bay Times discovered that the church had raised $145million for the building, much higher than the $100million it was estimated to cost. Former Scientologist couple Rocio and . Luis Garcia of Irvine, California contributed more than $340,000 to the . construction of the Super Power building, before ultimately suing the . church in federal court for dragging out the project 'as a shill'. Church representatives have described the Garcia's suit as 'frivolous'. While . the new building is part of a larger complex of buildings that serve as . a spiritual retreat for Scientologists, there will be space on the . ground floor for visitors to learn about the religion. The . visitor center will have a 'grand lobby' with a three-story atrium and . exhibits that explain the religion's belief system and practices. The second and third floors are home to offices and classrooms while the basement houses a huge kitchen and dining areas. Three . hundred small rooms for 'auditing' can be found on the buildings upper . floors. Auditing is the religions form of counseling and a session can . cost $1,000. But . the jewel in the crown of the Flag Building is on the fifth floor, . where members can pariticapte in the Super Power program for the first . time. The Super Power program was developed by the religion's found L Ron Hubbard and described as one of his greatest discoveries. Super powers: The main purpose of the building will be to provide a space for members to receive 'Super Power' training - a program developed by the religion's founder L Ron Hubbard (above) in the 1970s . Famous followers: The religion is famous for drawing a celebrity following. Actors Tom Cruise (left) and John Travolta (right) are Scientologists . 'Super Power is a series of spiritual counseling processes designed to give a person back his own viewpoint, increase his perception, exercise his power of choice, and greatly enhance other spiritual abilities,' church spokesman Ben Shaw said in a statement. Hubbard went further in his description of the program saying: 'Super Power is the answer to a sick, a dying and dead society...With it we literally revive the dead.' As part of that therapy, members will be spun on an anit-gravity simulator blindfolded to improve their 'perceptics' - Hubbard's 57 senses which include sight, smell, taste, blood circulation, and awareness of awareness. Another interesting feature of the building is the circular running track located on floor six. Scientologists use the track for 'Cause Resurgence Rundown'. Basically they run until they have a moment of enlightenment called 'cognition'.","The Flag Building is the tallest build in Clearwater, Florida and the home to Scientology's 'Super Power' program .

"From a 62-year-old pole dancer to a club DJ in her 70s, a new book hopes to change our ideas about what life is like after 70, 80, 90 or even 100.

The international project aims to alter our perception of life after retirement with pictures of inspirational pensioners like incredible Greta Pontarelli who has the body and flexibility of a young gymnast after taking up pole dancing to treat her osteoporosis. Greta Pontarelli, 62, turned to pole dancing as she needed to do strenuous exercise after she was diagnosed with bone disease osteoporosis . Greta, from California, started pole dancing two years ago, after she was advised to take up something to strengthen her bones. She needed something that would involve lifting weights but more fun. She said: 'Weight-lifting is very boring. That's why I looked into pole dancing' Greta Pontarelli, 62, from California, stays active by pole dancing after discovering at 59 that she had the fragile bone disease osteoporosis. She sad: 'To strengthen my bones, I needed strenuous exercise, something that would involve lifting weights. But just weight-lifting is very boring. That's why I looked into pole dancing.' She now competes internationally, showing off energetic moves and poses that would defeat most younger women. Among the photo subjects is Ruth Flowers, who decided to become a club DJ under the name Mamy Rock when she turned 68. After losing her husband suddenly, who she had lived with for 40 years, she found she no longer wanted to stay in their home in a village in Portugal. Everything reminded her of her loss and she decided she had to try something new. When she told friends she was set on becoming a DJ, they said her sorrow 'had driven her to madness'.

FIgure skater Yvonne said: 'If I ever get in a bad mood, I look at my peers with their oxygen bags, put on my skates and smile' When Yvonne Dowlen, from Colorado, US, was 80, she was in a car accident and was severely concussed. A doctor told her to hang her skates on a nail and consider her athletic career finished. But the former skating pro, who laced up her first pair of skates in 1939 when Franklin Roosevelt was in the White House, ignored his advice. Today 86-year-old Yvonne goes out on to the ice just as before and participates in competitions. She said: 'When I’m in a bad mood, I look at my contemporaries with their oxygen pillows, put on my skates and smile.' Ruth, who died last year at the age of 73, couldn't understand why everyone was so convinced that older people are supposed to sit quietly at home and not dance at night clubs.

When John Lowe turned 90, his family - four children and eleven grandchildren - forbade him from leaping and turning 360 degrees in mid-air. 'They are afraid that if I fall, they won't be able to put me back together, and, in a way, they are right,' he joked. Johanna Quaas, from Germany, appeared in her own gymnastics competition at the age of 11, but last year her improves moves found fame as videos of her training posted on YouTube went viral and generated three million views.

"Get ready to feel a ghostly shiver down your spine. This is the haunting moment a chair was caught on CCTV apparently moving on its own in a closed theatre hours after a psychic finished his show. It was recorded at Brookside Theatre in Romford, Essex, at around 4am on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Haunting: In the grainy CCTV footage of the main hall at Brookside Theatre, you can just make out a chair (ringed) mysteriously moving . Proof of the supernatural? According to Jai Sepple, who runs the volunteer-run Essex theatre, it is only the latest unexplained event to happen there . Hours earlier the theatre, housed in a former war memorial building, was packed with people attending a show by the medium Roy Roberts. He told MailOnline he now believes the video could prove there's a resident ghost. 'When I saw the footage I jumped up and said, ""yes, now we have direct proof!"" 'I had a feeling earlier that there was the presence of something, a playful presence of a child, to one side of the room and it seems that must have been it,' he said. 'It doesn't surprise me, it's that sort of a place - it's really active - so when I heard about what had happened I was really excited. 'To me there is no way there is anyone in that theatre when the chair moves and there's no way anyone can say it is staged. I've never seen anything like this directly caught on camera, this is something that is paranormal. 'People can't dispute that, they will try, but they can't dispute it. I am 100 per cent sure that is energy.' Mr Roberts said he now plans to take a team of paranormal investigators to the theatre to investigate further. Jai Sepple, who runs the 140-seat volunteer-run theatre, told MailOnline the ghostly goings-on were not a surprise. Chilling: The imprint of what is believed to be a child's foot, just one of the ghostly goings-on Jai Sepple, who runs the 140-seat volunteer-run theatre, has experienced . Is this real? A photograph of a ghostly figure Mr Sepple says a cast member saw appear in his theatre . The theatre is housed inside Romford War Memorial Social Club building . Medium Roy Roberts believes the footage offers conclusive proof supernatural powers exist . The building is a former Second World War memorial and social club for senior citizens, and in the two years since it was converted into a theatre he says it's had plenty of unexplained events. 'The only reason we checked the CCTV was because we came in on Sunday morning and the chair was out of line,' he said. 'One of the last things I do when I close up is line-up all the chairs so I knew something had happened. It had clearly moved. 'There is also a table that moved but that's harder to make out. I'm quite sceptical about all this kind of thing but my wife isn't, she believes in it. 'There have been several things that have happened in the past, noises and creeks etc, but we've got used to it. 'We've had a child's footprints in the foyer, and one cast member said he saw a strange figure once. He ran after it thinking it was a person, but the figure just disappeared and there was nowhere for it to go. He was visibly shaken after that. 'Another cast member says he was pushed into a toilet, and he's a big chap so we don't think a person could have done it. 'Up until now though we've just kept quiet about all this, what with it being a war memorial. 'It's quite interesting, we don't know whether to laugh or cry. 'Lots of people have been emailing in saying faked it but I can assure you I've neither the time or the knowledge to do that!'","Chair moved mysteriously in a hall hours after a psychic show finished .

"Daredevil Felix Baumgartner is about to embark on his biggest adventure yet - marrying his girlfriend and settling down. The risk-taking pilot will wed former model and beauty queen Nicole Oetl next year. The Austrian couple then plan to make their home in Arbon, Switzerland. Scroll down for video . Lovebirds: King of the skies Felix Baumgartner and Nicole Oetl, pictured in Roswell ahead of his space jump, are preparing to marry next year . Baumgartner had delayed the wedding plans until after he completed his astounding 24-mile high jump from a space capsule. His fiancee was forced to watch with her heart in her mouth as the 43-year-old plummeted towards the ground at speeds of up to 834mph. Now he has come through the terrifying feat unscathed, Baumgartner is ready to tie the knot with 26-year-old Miss Oetl. He intends to marry the former Miss Lower Austria in the New Year. Fearless Felix has previously jumped from a plane and flown across the Channel with wings strapped to his back, leaped off the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, and plunged from the 101-storey Taipei Tower in Taiwan. TV viewers around the world watched frozen in shock on Sunday as the Austrian skydiver took on the biggest leap of his career, freefalling from the edge of space. It took Baumgartner around two-and-a-half hours to reach 128,177ft above the New Mexico desert - and less than ten minutes to plummet down . Leap of faith: Millions watched in shock as Baumgartner plummeted 24 miles at 834mph . Eight million saw the clip on YouTube alone . as he became the first skydiver to break the sound barrier in the . highest and fastest drop ever known. Perhaps the sheer terror of the drop persuaded the brave pilot to keep his feet on the ground for a while longer. He has admitted that one point in his supersonic plunge towards earth, he went into an out-of-control 'death spin'. 'In that situation, when you spin around, it's like hell and you don't know if you can get out of that spin or not,' he said. 'The exit was perfect but then I started spinning slowly. I thought I’d just spin a few times and that would be that, but then I started to speed up. 'It was really brutal at times. I thought for a few seconds that I’d lose consciousness.' Freefall experts immediately recognised the danger that Baumgartner was in as he began to spin laterally, his head and feet rotating around his centre. Death spin: Freefall experts immediately recognised the danger that Baumgartner was in as he began to spin laterally, his head and feet rotating around his centre . Risks as he turned through the air from 128,000ft included a headache, shortness of breath, vision failure, mental confusion and even unconsciousness. Another result could have been burst eyeballs — this occurs when pressures exceeding -4 G's build up in the skull and blood and spinal fluid are forced outward. 'When I was spinning the first 10, 20 seconds, I never thought I was going to lose my life but I was disappointed because I'm going to lose my record. I put seven years of my life into this,' he said. 'Of course it was terrifying. I was fighting all the way down because I knew that there must be a moment where I can handle it.' As onlookers in the command centre began to become extremely concerned, he finally managed to stabilise and regain control of his attempt. More than 40 television networks in 50 countries carried the live feed, the organisers reported, and it was shown my more than 130 digital outlets. Baumgartner has made more than 2,600 terrifying jumps. Feet on the ground: Baumgartner is now a hero after he smashed records with his terrifying jump . He spent five years in the Austrian army, where he served in its parachute display team, before learning to base jump in 1995. Within two years, he was the base jumping world champion after plunging from a bridge in West Virginia and had soon earned the sponsorship of energy drinks maker Red Bull. After that, the sky was the limit as he tried ever more dangerous and outlandish jumps. He once said he wanted  to be known as ‘the God of the Skies’, adding: ‘The bit I love most is the second before jumping when you know it can all go wrong yet you still do it.’ Let's hope his bride-to-be has nerves of steel as well. In 2003, he struck panic into the heart of then-girlfriend Katjuschka Altmann by jumping out of a plane at 30,000ft and flying over the Channel with just a 6ft-wing carbon fibre wing strapped to his back. ‘I couldn’t sleep last night, but I never doubted he could do it,’ she said after the stunt.","Daredevil 43-year-old completed highest and fastest space jump ever .

"Britain's athletes prospered at the European Championships and Commonwealth Games but you have to look further for one of the sport’s best tales. Thomas Somers, a 17-year-old former England youth rugby player from Yorkshire, ran 20.37sec in the 200 metres heats at the World Junior Championships in Eugene, Oregon in July. The only man faster at that age? Usain Bolt. Of course, ‘the next Bolt’ tag is overused and unfair, and Somers has his head screwed on the right way to know that. Speaking during a free period at school, he is humble, bright and driven to succeed. Only Usain Bolt was faster at 17 in the 200m than British sensation Thomas Somers . Somers ran the distance in 20.37sec at the World Junior Championships in July this year . ‘I’m still trying to get my head around it, it’s all a bit weird,’ he said. ‘It’s such an accolade, it’s something amazing that I don’t think I’ll ever forget. ‘The moment they told me about Bolt my face gleamed with joy and I said, “are you serious?”’ Somers finished seventh in the final the following day, but the schoolboy’s semi-final time, joint-second with DaBryan Blanton’s 20.37sec in Austin in 2001, has given him even more hunger to reach the top. He doesn’t mind the Bolt tag. ‘I don’t think I’ve got used to people saying it, it’s such a good thing to be called. It’s such an honour to be up there with him. ‘It’s unbelievable to be classed in the same bracket as the fastest man in the world. To say that I’m second on the all-time list to him is amazing. ‘He’s definitely somebody I really look up to and appreciate everything he has done for the sport; the times he’s run, his technique.’ Bolt’s time of 20.13sec in Bridgetown in 2003 remains out of reach, but Somers’ bright future is testament to his intriguing story. He quit rugby having played in Leeds Carnegie’s academy, and even appeared for England Under 16s northern side at the Wellington Festival last year. It was a tough decision but his love for running started at an early stage in his life. From the age of four until 11, he ran 1.5-mile and three-mile fun runs while his parents did the 10k events. But he loved the rugby too and it took the intervention of another sprint sensation to make his mind up. His decision was thanks partly to the advice of Adam Gemili. In Mannheim, Germany, in the summer, the two exchanged words. Somers had previously sustained a broken wrist playing for his school team, and Gemili, European 200m champion, further encouraged him to stick to the track rather than the wing. Somers represented England rugby at youth level before quitting to focus on athletics . Somers is aiming to take his place int he Rio 2016 Olympics, when he will be aged just 19 . ‘He basically told me I shouldn’t be playing rugby,’ recalled Somers. ‘He used to play football for quite a long time — he said that I’d get injured and spoil my chances and the times I’ve been achieving. It’s been good advice so far! ‘Once I broke my wrist I gained Futures Programme funding, which coincided quite nicely and now I just focus on athletics. ‘Rugby is a team game, athletics is obviously more individual, but I liked the competitiveness of both.’ The Futures Programme is a British Athletics-run scheme directed by double Olympic high jumper Jo Jennings aimed at getting more Union Jacks on the podium. Somers took advice from fellow sprinter Adam Gemili before quitting rugby . The 17-year-old quit rugby having played in Leeds Carnegie’s academy, and even appeared for England Under 16s northern side at the Wellington Festival last year . It helps with everything from equipment to travel to general advice, and has got Somers this far. But what’s next? He will be 19 when the Rio Olympics comes along, but his goals for that and beyond show his ambitious side. ‘Over the next two years, I’d like to keep improving at the same rate and I’d like to go to Rio in 2016. ‘I think it could be achievable, but my main goal is London 2017 (World Championships). ‘Next year I’ll be trying to qualify for the European Juniors and try to pick up my first international medal. I’ve been to two international events and have made the final, but haven’t come away with a medal. That’s definitely the aim.’ His main goal is to represent Great Britain at the 2017 World Championships in London . Somers has the winter to improve, while keeping more than a keen eye on his studies at Queen Ethelburga’s School in Harrogate, where teachers give him extended deadlines when he has important races coming up. ‘There are a lot of decisions about where I want to go and what I want to do,’ he said. ‘I’ve got quite a few universities in mind, such as Bath, Loughborough, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, but it’s all about getting the grades before I can make those decisions.’ One thing is clear, the Bolt tag has no danger of catapulting his feet off the ground. Thomas Somers is supported by British Athletics’ Futures Programme for 2014-15, which provides targeted support for young athletes and their coaches.

"It’s bad enough checking your partner’s phone when they leave the room, or taking a peek at their Facebook page, yet a new app takes this level of snooping not just a step further, but a giant leap forward. The mSpy app works on select smartphones including Apple, Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone and can be used to gain access to an unprecedented level of personal information. It records phone calls, tracks a person’s location, lets users remotely read texts, Skype, Facebook and Viber messages, view browsing history and even see how much battery the phone has left. Scroll down for video . The mSpy app can be installed to select smartphones and lets spies remotely see which apps have been used and how often, pictured. The app also lets them read text messages, emails, Skype chats, Facebook messages and more . Three fifths of men in relationships in the UK claim to have snooped for 'incriminating messages or activity', compared to a third of women, according to recent research by mobilephonechecker.co.uk. When asked to reveal if they had ever looked through a current or ex-partner’s mobile phone without their knowledge, 62 per cent of the men taking part and just 34 per cent of female respondents admitted that they had done so. When asked for the motivations behind wanting to check up on their partner, the majority (89 per cent) admitted they had done so to see if their partner had been talking to anyone else in a romantic or sexual context, indicating signs of infidelity. Furthermore, 52 per cent of those asked admitted that they knew the passcode or password needed to access their partner’s phone in order to do this. According to Oregon-based mSpy’s website the app is designed for 'monitoring your children, employees or others on a smartphone or mobile device’. However, it adds the person doing the spying must own the device being tracked, or the person being tracked must give their permission. To use the app, spies must pay a monthly fee that starts at £24.99 for a limited range of features, up to £44.99 for access to them all. Spies can also use the app to view videos and photos stored on a device, see the phone owner's list of applications and software updates, open their calendar, notes and tasks, and even get hold of the phone’s unique IMEI number. They can additionally remotely lock or wipe a device, block websites and calls from certain contacts as well as record the person’s surroundings. People wanting to use the app do need to physically install it onto the phone they wish to track, yet once installed mSpy promises the app is 100 per cent undetectable. The app also tracks a person's location and plots where they've been on a map, pictured, that can be accessed from an online dashboard remotely. MSpy additionally stores browsing history and can even tell a spy how much battery is left on the device . This is because the app runs it what the company calls ‘stealth mode’  and doesn’t appear in the phone owner’s apps list. It works in a similar way to encryption lockers that are designed to be hidden deliberately and can only be found by the installer. These apps, however, are designed to protect information and privacy. Subscribers can choose to sync the data automatically, only over Wi-Fi, or manually and if automatic sync is selected the data is updated every 30 minutes. Users can then track this information from anywhere by signing into an online account and viewing it all on a dashboard. The dashboard produces charts that . show which apps have been used and how often, while the person’s . location is plotted on to a map. ‘We . do have quite a large portion of our customers who use mSPY . specifically to catch a cheating spouse,"" mSPy’s Tatiana Ameri told ABC 22 news. But added ‘We do ask our users to make sure they've got their monitored partners consent.’ According . to mSpy the app works on Apple, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone and . Symbian, however, it will only work on jailbroken iOS devices and . doesn’t work with iOS 7. Android phones, similarly, need to be rooted.

For £44.99 a month, subscribers also get access to Skype messages, pictured, Facebook chats and other in-app content . Subscribers can install the app on multiple devices to track different children in a family, for example, or employees. Commenting on the app, Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, told MailOnline: 'The fact companies are selling extremely intrusive spyware so brazenly begs the question if we are properly protecting people from snooping by their boss, parents or indeed anyone who has enough time to install the app on their phone. 'This is the kind of technology you'd expect the security services to be using, not for sale with the click of a mouse. You don’t teach kids to think about their privacy by secretly listening to their calls or reading their emails, nor do you create a productive working environment by routinely snooping on your employees. 'Buried in the small print is the fact it is illegal to monitor someone’s phone without notifying them, but the risks of abuse are only too clear and this kind of technology needs to be much more tightly regulated.'

"Randy Allen Taylor, 48, who has been charged in connection with missing teen Alexis Murphy, may have links with Samantha Clarke, 19, who is also missing . The suspect in the case of missing teenager Alexis Murphy may be linked to the disappearance of another teenage girl, a lawyer has said. Randy Taylor, 48, has been charged with the abduction of the missing 17-year-old Alexis, who has was last spotted by a camera in Lovingston, Nelson County, at a gas station where Taylor was also spotted. While Alexis, a student at Nelson County High School, has not yet been found, investigators are also looking at the case of Samantha Clarke, 19, who has been missing from her home in neighboring Orange County for three years. Orange County commonwealth's attorney Diane Wheeler said Taylor was the last person known to have had contact with Miss Clarke before she disappeared on September 13 2010. A graduate of Orange County High School, Miss Clarke had told her brother she was going out for the evening but never returned. Ms Wheeler told the Huffington Post: 'He was the person who last had contact with her ... He had multiple contacts with her in the days immediately preceding her disappearance... 'The investigation is still continuing and he remains a person of interest to us.' Taylor is being held at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail after he was arrested on Monday on suspicion of abduction by force. He appeared in court yesterday on the felony charge and investigators are currently examining his camo-wrapped car and a camper found at his home near Lovingston. Unlike Miss Clarke, Alexis is not thought to have known Taylor. Her last Twitter entry at 6.40pm on August 3 read: 'I actually look cute right now' and she was later picked up by the gas station CCTV camera at 7.15pm. Three days later police found Miss Aleixs' abandoned Nissan in Charlottesville, 39 miles from the gas station. Alexis Murphy, 17, has not been seen since August 3; Taylor has been charged in connection with her disappearance . Missing: Samantha Clarke, 19, was last seen nearly three years ago when she left her home in Orange County . They are also looking at footage said to show Taylor in Ultimate Bliss, an adult store two miles from where the Nissan was found, on the day Alexis went missing. One man has told how he saw Taylor sitting in his vehicle in the Lovingston Food Lion parking lot, opposite the gas station where Alexis was seen. Bruce Johnson told a reporter he had seen the suspect watching people from inside his suburban. FBI agents search for clues on Alexis' white Nissan Maxima in the Charlottesville parking lot where it was found . Taylor's camo-wrapped suburban is being inspected by forensics officers while he awaits his next court date . He told NBC29.com: 'He was just sitting in that parking lot watching and that kind of was strange to me... 'A suburban with antennas on it, camouflage down the side of it - that's kind of suspicious because I've never seen that vehicle around here before.' Taylor is next due in court in January for a preliminary hearing.","Randy Taylor, 48, has been charged over disappearance of Alexis, 17 .

"A controversial theory that humans evolved from amphibious apes has won new support . A controversial theory that humans evolved from amphibious apes has won new support. The aquatic ape theory, whose supporters include David Attenborough, suggests that apes emerged from the water, lost their fur, started to walk upright and then developed big brains. While it has been treated with scorn by some scientists since it first emerged 50 years ago, it is backed by a committed group of academics, including Sir David. The group will hold a major London conference next week featuring several speakers who will voice support for the theory. Peter Rhys Evans is one of the organisers of Human Evolution: Past, Present and Future. He told the Observer that humans are very different from other apes, as we lack fur, walk upright, have big brains and subcutaneous fat and have a descended larynx - which is common among aquatic animals. According to evolutionary theories, these features appeared at separate times, for different reasons. But the aquatic ape theory says they appeared because our ancestors decided to live in or near water for millions of years. British biologist Sir Alister Hardy first theorised that we were descended from aquatic apes. He wrote that apes came down from the trees to live in the food rich creeks, river and seas. He said they evolved to become upright as they tried to keep their heads above water, and lost their hair. They developed fat to keep warm in the water. Rhys Evans, an expert on head and neck physiology at the Royal Marsden hospital, London, told the Observer that humans have large sinuses. He argues the spaces in the cranium between cheeks, noses and foreheads, acted as buoyancy aids that helped keep our heads above water. Others have dismissed the theory. Professor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, London, said that while wading through water was as good as any explanation for our upright gait, the 'whole aquatic ape package includes attributes that appeared at very different times in our evolution.' Supporters of the theory say  humans developed large brains thanks to Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) - an omega-3 fatty acid found in seafood . He said: 'If they were all the result of our lives in watery environments, we would have to have spent millions of years there and there is no evidence for this - not to mention like crocodiles and other creatures would have made the water a very dangerous place.' Supporters of the theory also argue that human brain biochemistry could also help prove the link. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) - an omega-3 fatty acid found in seafood - boosts brain growth in mammals. Dr Michael Crawford, of Imperial College London, said without a high DHA diet from seafood we could not have developed big brains. He said the world's sources of DHA – fish stocks – are threatened, with 'crucial consequences for our species.' He added: 'Without plentiful DHA, we face a future of increased mental illness and intellectual deterioration. We need to face up to that urgently. That is the real lesson of the aquatic ape theory.'","Supporters of the aquatic ape theory include Sir David Attenborough .

"A man claims he was the victim of a brutal sex assault by Top of the Pops DJ Alan Freeman and his friend, Jimmy Savile, when he was just 11-years-old. He also claims German film actor Victor Beaumont was the man who lured the schoolboy to his plush London flat where the rape allegedly took place. Now nearly 50 years on, the anguished victim has reported the allegations to officers from Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree - the police investigation into the alleged sexual abuse by disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile. Allegations: A man claims pals Jimmy Savile and Alan Freeman sexually attacked him when he was just 11 . Alan 'Fluff' Freeman, who was known for his legendary catchphrases 'Greetings, Pop Pickers' and 'Not 'Arf' is the latest household name to come under the investigation's spotlight and raises further concerns that a paedophile ring operated within the BBC. Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, the man claims Freeman and Savile 'showed me no pity and arrogantly thought they could get away with anything'. Recalling the incident in 1964, the year that Savile and Freeman were founder presenters on the BBC's Top of the Pops, the man says he was approached by Beaumont while in the changing rooms at Granville Road swimming baths in Kilburn, north London. He claims the German actor - whose real name was Peter Wolff and starred in hit films Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone - tried to usher the schoolboy away from the swimming baths after a fight broke out in the changing rooms. The man, who has been married for 20 years, then claims Beaumont, who was wearing expensive clothes and gold-rimmed glasses, lead him to his Mercedes car outside and offered him sweets and cigarettes. The Berlin-born actor said he wanted the boy to meet his wife and son, 'Klaus'. The young boy asked to be taken to a bus stop, but Beaumont insisted on taking him back to his flat in Maida Vale, north west London. DJ Freeman also had a flat in the same block. After arriving at the flat, he claims the actor shut the French windows, drew the curtains and told the boy to dry himself, as he had not had time to do so at the swimming pool. Claims: Actor Victor Beaumont (left), seen here with Norman Wisdom in 1958 film The Square Peg, allegedly lured the boy to his flat in Maida Vale . He then alleges that he was locked in the bedroom, while Beaumont summoned Freeman and Savile. Before he had a chance to react, the man claims Beaumont ripped the towel from him and shoved him on to the bed. The man, who has gone through years of therapy, claims: 'He went to force his hand on the back of my head and . that’s when I saw two other men entering the room behind him. The first . was wearing a dark suit and a tie. The other man behind him was wearing a . tracksuit.' He also alleges that he heard the name 'Fluff' being used during and after the brutal sexual attack, which left him unconscious. When he awoke, the man says he heard his attackers arguing outside the bedroom and he took the opportunity to escape through a window. Years later, the man said he recognised Freeman from his picture on the cover of the Radio Times magazine. Under the spotlight: Alan Freeman revealed in later years that he was bisexual and is now at the centre of the latest claims reported to Operation Yewtree . The Australian-born DJ, who revealed was bisexual in a 1994 interview, died in 2006 aged 79. Likewise, the victim recognised Beaumont decades later after seeing the 1958 comedy, The Square Peg on television. Beaumont died in 1977 aged 64. Meanwhile, the man says he encountered Savile while driving past Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where the disgraced DJ was a fundraiser. 'I saw this figure jogging and my blood ran cold. I drove at him thinking I would kill him but couldn't bring myself to do it.' Disgraced DJ: The victim claims to have seen Savile years after the alleged attack in 1964 while out jogging close to Stoke Mandeville Hospital . He also claims to have shouted 'Maida Vale' at him repeatedly, before Savile disappeared into the hospital's grounds. The Metropolitan Police confirmed it is aware of the new allegations. Last month, it was reported a BBC compensation package worth £33,000 . could be handed to 120 victims of disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile. The . exact amount is expected to be finalised when high court judge Dame . Janet Smith publishes the results of her inquiry, which is looking into . the culture and practices at the BBC during the years of Savile’s abuse, . later in the year.","Man claims he was lured to Maida Vale flat by German actor Victor Beaumont .

"Danger: Two British boys, aged three months and five months, contracted botulism and could not be cured until £50,000 medication was flown over from the US . Two British babies have contracted a rare life-threatening disease triggered by eating honey. The boys, aged three months and five months, had to be put on life-support machines suffering from infant botulism. Both had been feeding badly and showed typical symptoms – a floppy head, drooping eyelids and constipation. They were cured only after medication costing £50,000 a dose was flown in from America. The incidents, confirmed last week, have prompted public health chiefs to warn that infants under one should not be given honey. The younger boy had eaten honey, while the older one had been given a homeopathic treatment that may have contained honey, which can carry the potentially deadly bacteria. The identities of the babies treated and the hospitals involved have not been disclosed. But according to the latest health protection report from Public Health England, the five-month-old was diagnosed just before Christmas in central or southern England. He may still be in hospital because recovery can sometimes take six months. He had taken the homeopathic remedy before becoming ill, though tests on it showed no trace of botulism. The three-month-old was treated at a children’s hospital in northern England and has recovered. His mother admitted giving him honey at home, though tests on what was left in the jar also failed to detect the botulism bacteria. Products containing honey should carry warnings on the label but these often appear in small print and the dangers of the food are not widely known. Warning: The incident sparked health experts to warn children under one year old should not be fed honey. Botulism is caused by bacteria in soil, possibly spread by bees (file picture) The disease is caused by the bacteria . Clostridium botulinum, which lives in the environment, especially soil. If bees pick it up they can infect honey. Dr Kathie Grant, a disease surveillance expert for Public Health England, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I am concerned that not enough mothers and women know about infant botulism and what can cause it. Children under 12 months should not be fed honey. What is botulism? A rare but serious paralytic disease caused by a germ normally dormant in soil and dust which can get into honey. Is honey safe? Not for children under one.  A younger baby’s gut is not sufficiently developed to fight off bacteria. The condition can be fatal  in five to ten per cent of cases. What are symptoms? Constipation, inability to suck, poor feeding, floppy head and muscles, droopy eyelids, tiredness, difficulty breathing. What else is a risk? Soil, dust, herbal teas, homeopathic treatments, terrapins. 'They don’t need homeopathic preparations or herbal tea. They should also be kept away from dust and soil and pet terrapins.’ The disease is rare, with only 17 UK cases since 1978. But health chiefs are concerned that nine have occurred in the past five years and of these seven babies had eaten honey. In one of the nine cases a baby was infected from dust falling during a loft conversion while another caught botulism from pet terrapins kept at home. Dr Grant said: ‘Mothers think honey is natural and good for babies. There is also a tradition for honey to be used on a dummy to soothe a troubled baby or to sweeten other foods, but we are urging  people not to do it.’ She advised that any baby who is constipated for three days should be taken to see a GP and for parents to watch out for other symptoms such as difficulty in swallowing. Social networking forums Mumsnet and Netmums have scores of queries from new mothers asking if honey is safe for babies, while older mothers admit they only learned about the risk from an old episode of BBC 1’s Casualty.","Two British boys, 3 months and 5 months, put on life-support machines .

"Astronomers around the world are . tracking with eager anticipation the arrival of a comet next year which . could even outshine our Moon in the night sky. Comet ISON is expected to draw . millions into the dark to witness what is likely to be the most . brilliant comet seen in many generations. It is visiting the inner solar system . for what is thought to be the first time and is set to put on . spectacular views for the Northern Hemisphere across November and . December as it heads towards the sun. Look to the skies next year: Comet ISON could produce a spectacular show when it flies by next year - similar to the 1997 appearance of Hale-Bopp (pictured) How Hale-Bopp looked above Alaska: Next year's comet is predicted to be even more spectacular, and remain in the skies for weeks . It may prove to be brighter than any . comet of the last century - visible even in daylight - and this may end . up being its one and only trip to the solar system, as its trajectory . may see it plunge into the sun in a fiery death. It is currently moving inwards from . beyond Jupiter, and as it approaches the Earth, the 'dirty snowball' could produce a dazzling display, burning brighter than the moon and . potentially being visible in broad daylight. Astronomer Dr David Whitehouse, . writing in The Independent, says the comet will be visible to the naked . eye in the night sky by late November. Spotted in space: Two astronomers from Russia discovered the icy ball, pictured here dimly lit against background stars . 'Its tail could stretch like a searchlight into the sky above the horizon,' Dr Whitehouse writes. 'Then it will swing rapidly around the . Sun, passing within two million miles of it, far closer than any planet . ever does, to emerge visible in the evening sky heading northward . towards the pole star. 'It could be an ""unaided eye"" object . for months. When it is close in its approach to the Sun it could become . intensely brilliant but at that stage it would be difficult and . dangerous to see without special instrumentation as it would be only a . degree from the sun.' The comet, which was discovered by . astronomers using the International Scientific Optical Network (ISON) telescope in Russia, will pass within two million miles of the sun's . surface - making it a 'sun-grazing' comet. It is on a 'parabolic' orbit, which . means it probably originated from the outer skirts of the solar system, . perhaps from the Oort cloud - a mass of icy debris which lies 50,000 . times further from the sun than the Earth does. If comet ISON survives the encounter, . it could take thousands - potentially millions - of years before the . comet passes back through the inner solar system. Hale-Bopp sailed overhead, leaving two trails: An ionic trail of magnetically-charged particles facing directly away from the sun (left), and a trail of dust and debris (right) Comets are dusty balls of ice, which generally originate from the Kuipler belt - a region of icy small bodies beyond Neptune. Occasionally, a comet gets dislodged from its orbit, and plunges in to the inner solar system. They differ from asteroids, which are made of metal or rock, and are usually the left over remnants of planets or moons. Comets are not really reflective - they only reflect 4 per cent of the the Sun's rays, about the same as coal. So although they look brilliantly white from Earth, they are black at the surface. Halley's comet is the most well-known, named after Edmond Halley who noted the regular 75-76-year appearance of a comet, and predicted it would return in 1758, although sadly the astronomer died 16 years before he was proved correct. Halley's comet has passed within a fraction of the Earth before - in 1910 the Earth even moved through the comet's tail. Sadly, the 1986 re-appearance was the worst for 2,000 years, as the Earth and the comet were on opposite sides of the sun. The comet will begin brightening once . it gets within Jupiter's orbit, as the sun's heat begins boiling the ice . locked within the comet, converting it directly into gas. It is likely to recall the excitement . of Comet Hale-Bopp, which sailed past the Earth in 1997, appearing as a . static-looking smear in the skies across the Northern Hemisphere. It is also set to outshine 'the . greatest comet of the last century' - Comet McNaught, which shone . brighter than Venus as it passed above the southern hemisphere in 1965. Comets are known as 'dirty snowballs', . although technically a better definition would be 'snowy dirtballs', as . comets are generally rocky at the surface, with chemical-laden ice . within the interior. As the ice and chemicals heat up, they . erupt as brilliant jets which can form tails lasting hundreds of . thousands of kilometres in length. The comet is expected to be bright throughout late November and early December. Robin Scagell, vice-president of the Society for Popular Astronomy, said: 'This is a very exciting discovery. 'The comet looks like it could become a . very spectacular sight in the evening sky after sunset from the UK in . late November and early December next year. 'Our members will be eagerly following . it as it makes its first trip around the Sun and hoping to see it . shining brilliantly and displaying a magnificent tail as it releases . powerful jets of gas and dust.'","Comet ISON to be visible to the naked eye by November 2013 in the Northen Hemisphere .

"Killer: John Wayne Gacy murdered at least 33 teenage boys during the 1970s . Since John Wayne Gacy was executed for slaying at least 33 teenage boys in sexually-motivated crimes in the 1970s, investigators have long since wondered if the killer took secrets about other murders to his grave. Now a U.S. Sheriff's office has discovered an innovative way to solve cold cases - by adding the DNA of long-dead serial killers into a national database. Officers at the Sheriff's Department in Cook County, Illinois, have created DNA profiles of Gacy and other serial killers, and found a legal method of getting the executed killers' samples entered into databases shared with other law enforcement agencies. They can do so because the murderers are technically listed as homicide victims themselves - once they have been put to death by the state. The department now hopes to find . matches of DNA evidence from blood, semen or strands of hair, or skin . under the fingernails of victims that link the long-dead killers to the . coldest of cold cases. And . they're hoping to prompt authorities in other states to submit the DNA . of their own executed inmates or from decades-old crime scenes. 'You . just know some of these guys did other murders', said Jason Moran, the detective leading the effort, noting that some of the executed . killers ranged all over the country before the convictions that put . them behind bars for the last time. The . Illinois testing, which began during the summer, is the latest chapter . in a story that began when Sheriff Tom Dart exhumed the remains of . unknown victims of Gacy to create DNA profiles. Blood of a serial killer: Three vials of serial murderer John Wayne Gacy's blood - recently discovered and analysed by Cook County Sheriff's detective Jason Moran . These could be compared with the DNA of people whose loved ones went missing in the 1970s, when Gacy was killing young men. That effort, which led to the identification of one Gacy victim, caused Dart to wonder if the technology could help answer a question that has been out there for decades: Did Gacy kill anyone besides those young men whose bodies were stashed under his house or tossed in a river? 'He traveled a lot,' Moran said of Gacy. 'Even though we don't have any information he committed crimes elsewhere, the sheriff asked if you could put it past such an evil person.' After unexpectedly finding three vials of Gacy's blood stored with other Gacy evidence, Moran learned the state would only accept the blood in the crime database if it came from a coroner or medical examiner. Victims: Headshots of some of the boys and young men whose bodies were identified as victims of John Wayne Gacy . A body is removed from the home of John Wayne Gacy in Chicago on December 27, 1978 . Moran thought he was out of luck. But . then Will County Coroner Patrick O'Neil surprised him with this . revelation: In his office freezer were blood samples from Gacy and at . least three other executed inmates. The reason they were there is because . after the death penalty was reinstated in Illinois in the 1970s, . executions were carried out in Will County - all between 1990 and 1999, a . year before then-Gov. George Ryan established a moratorium on the death . penalty. So it was O'Neil's office that conducted the autopsies and collected the blood samples - but there was bigger obstacle to come. Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, left, and sheriff's detective Jason Moran, pictured with John Wayne Gacy's blood, which may help solve 'the coldest of cold' cases . While the state does send to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System the profiles of homicide victims no matter when they were killed, it will only send the profiles of known felons if they were convicted since a new state law was enacted about a decade ago that allowed them to be included, Moran said. That meant the profile of Gacy, who received a lethal injection in 1994, and the profiles of other executed inmates could not qualify for the database under the felon provision. They could, however, qualify as people who died by homicide. 'They're homicides because the state intended to take the inmate's life,' O'Neil said. Serial killer Ted Bundy, pictured in 1979 during the trial which led to his execution . Last year, authorities in Florida created a DNA profile from the blood of executed serial killer Ted Bundy in an attempt to link him to other murders. But officials there, where the law allows profiles of convicted felons be uploaded into the database as well as the phase-in of profiles of people arrested on felony charges, don't know of any law enforcement agency reaching back into history the way Cook County's sheriff's office is. 'We haven't had any initiative where we are going back to executed offenders and asking for their samples,' said David Coffman, director of Florida Department of Law Enforcement's laboratory system. 'I think it's an innovative approach.' O'Neil said he is still looking for blood samples of the rest of the 12 condemned inmates executed between 1977 when Illinois reinstated the death penalty and 2000 when then-Gov. George Ryan established a moratorium. So far, DNA profiles have been done on the blood of Gacy and two others; the profile of the fourth inmate has not yet been done. Among the other executed inmates whose blood was submitted for testing was Lloyd Wayne Hampton, a drifter executed in 1998 for his crimes. Not only did Hampton's long list of crimes include crimes outside the state - one conviction was for the torture of a woman in California - but shortly before he was put to death, he claimed to have committed other murders but never provided details. So far, no computer hits have linked Gacy or the others to any other crimes. But Moran and O'Neil suspect there are investigators who are holding DNA evidence that could help solve them. That is exactly what happened during the investigation into the 1993 slayings of seven people at a suburban Chicago restaurant, during which an evidence technician collected a half-eaten chicken dinner even though there was no way to test it for DNA at the time. When the technology did become available, the dinner was tested and it revealed the identity of one of two men ultimately convicted in the slayings. Moran says he wants investigators in other states to know that Gacy's blood is now open for analysis in their unsolved murders. He hopes those jurisdictions will, in turn, submit DNA profiles of their own executed inmates. 'That is part of the DNA system that's not being tapped into,' he said.","Gacy killed at least 33 boys in sexually-motivated crimes in the 1970s .

"Nine-year-old best friends . Antonia Lee Candelaria and Emily Conatzer died hand-in-hand as their school was . torn apart around them it has emerged today. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline . nine-year-old Antonia’s mother, Brandie Candelaria told of the comfort both . families draw from knowing their children were together, holding each other’s . hands, when the unthinkable happened. Brandie wept as she recalled: ‘I . went to see my little girl yesterday at the Chief Medical Examiner’s office. ‘There were little marks, imprints . and tiny scratches on her forearm like someone had been holding onto her, . clinging to her. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The body of little Antonia Lee Candelaria was discovered in Plaza Towers Elementary school holding her dearest friend Emily Conatzer . Best friends: Emily Conatzer was found in the rubble of Plaza Elementary school with Antonia Lee Candelaria . ‘We take some comfort in thinking . that she and Emily were holding onto each other and not alone.’ The little girls were, Ms . Candelaria said ‘inseparable in life.’ They had long been best friends at . Plaza Towers Elementary where both were in the third grade. When the Conatzers . moved into the Candelaria’s neighborhood last year they were, Ms Candelaria . said ‘just never apart.’ Now the families who were once . bonded simply by their daughters’ friendship are united in the bitter blessing . of having each found and lost a child in the storm that leveled a swathe of . Moore, Oklahoma. Antonia was the middle child of . three – her little sister, Lillian, is four months old and her older, Trinity, . is 10. Trinity was pulled from the . rubbled of Plaza Towers by her father, Jimmy Rosson, who helped save several children in his hunt for his girls. Emily Conatzer was one of two . girls - her little sister, Luci, was also rescued and returned to her parents, ‘a . little bit banged up but otherwise fine.’ Ms Candelaria said: ‘I don’t . remember exactly how it happened. I was at home with my youngest and we stayed . together when the Tornado hit. ‘As soon as it was over me and . Jimmy and the baby got out of our house and looked across to the Conatzers. Heartbroken: Emily's mother shared her grief and thanked people for their kind wishes . Devastated: Emily's mom Kristi wrote about her grief on Facebook saying she had worst news a parent could have . Big sister: Emily was big sister to Luci, pictured . ‘Her husband was working on . getting them out – they were okay but they were trapped a while.’ The parents were, Ms Candelaria . said, ‘just frantic’ to get to the school where both had two daughters. The first to be found was the . Conatzer’s youngest, then Trinity Candelaria. Ms Candelaria said: ‘Jimmy brought . Trinity back to me and wanted to go and carry on searching for Antonia but when . he went back they stopped them digging. ‘They stayed looking as long as . they could but they couldn’t get to them – they couldn’t get to my little . ladybug or Emily.’ Her voice cracking, wrung out with . grief, Ms Candelaria said: ‘That’s what she was – my little Ladybug. ‘My other girls are my Lovebugs. She’d just recently become a big sister and she loved it, she loved spoiling . her little baby sister. ‘She had such a beautiful . innocence about her, such a whole different way of looking at things. You’d . think 'How in the world did she come up with that?' Then you’d think about it . and it would make a kind of sense.’ Ms Candelaria, herself a state . employee, praised the teachers who helped rescue her eldest child. Questions have been asked as to . why Plaza Towers Elementary and Moore Elementary, both razed by the storm, did . not have underground bunkers or safe spaces built into the fabric of the . schoolhouses. Such measures could have been the difference between life and . death for those trapped within. Destruction: Officials said 2,400 homes had been destroyed or damaged in the tornado . Rebuilding: Families were combing through belongings and beginning to try and take stock of the damage today . Ms Candelaria said: ‘There’s a lot . of questions as to why things happened the way they happened but now isn’t the . time for pointing fingers or laying blame. ‘We have to do what we can for our . little girls. There are so many stories we have to share with each other, so . many memories or our beautiful ladybug. ‘Her service is tomorrow and all . the prayers and memories people have shared means so much.’ As does the thought that, as the . storm raged, her little girl was not entirely alone. Ms Candelaria said: ‘I couldn’t be . there with her but she was with her best friend and now she’s still with her . best friend and knowing that helps a bit.’ Kristen Strickland Conatzer shared her grief for little Emily online. Writing on Facebook yesterday she said: 'Today was the day that no parent wants to encounter, the words you never want to hear as a parent. 'Our baby didn't make it. I am overwhelmed by the support that is pouring in from all of my friends, family and Facebook family. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. 'I hope I wake up and she is jumping around on me giggling...but i know that she is in heaven smiling down. My baby I know you are with the unicorns tonight. Sleep well my angel.' Distraught: Laurinda Vargyas fought to save her baby Sydney, pictured, and 4-year-old, Karrina, who both died . Tragedy: . Megan Futrell, pictured, and her five-month-old baby were among those . killed at a 7-Eleven store in Moore, Oklahoma, which was destroyed in . Monday's tornado . Others rushed to pay tribute to the two little girls and spoke about their lovely enduring friendship. Antonia's uncle Paul Rosson wrote yesterday: 'Thanks everyone for your prayers and thoughts. We are doing the best we can considering. They found her this morning holding her best friends hand. They went to heaven together so they didn't have to be alone.' All seven children who died at the school have now been identified and all came from the same third grade class. Taking shelter in the basement it is believed many drowned in water from leaking pipes. The other five were named as Janae Hornsby, Sydney Angle, Nicolas McCabe and Christopher Legg and eight-year-old Kyle Davis . It was initially reported that the children died from drowning, but . officials said the causes of death were mechanical asphyxiation, which . is suffocation after being crushed by a heavy object. The chief of the Moore Fire Department officially called off the search at the site of the school today. They combed the debris three times and discovered no further victims beyond the seven discovered earlier in the week. Of the remaining 17 victims Terri Long, 49, Shannon Quick, 40, Jenny Neely, 38, and Cindy Plumley and Deanna Ward, whose ages are unknown, also lost their lives. Lost: Nine-year-old Janae Hornsby was one of the children who died. Her father said she always had a smile on her face . Victims: Kyle Davis, 8, and Sydney Angle, 9, were confirmed as deceased . Confirmed: Officials confirmed today that 9-year-old Nicholas McCabe was among those deceased . Family members said Jenny Neely was with her son Jacob when she died but no other details are forthcoming. They also confirmed Megan Futrell, 29, and her five-month-old baby, Case Futrell were killed in an obliterated 7-Eleven store. Four-year-old Karrina Varygas and her baby sister Sydnee Varygas, who was seven months, were also killed by blunt force trauma injuries when their house was ripped apart. Their mom Laurinda desperately tried to save them. Authorities . added that eight other adults aged between 39 and 65 died - mostly from blunt . force trauma. Local . reports named one of those victims as 65-year-old as Hermant Bhonde, who became separated from his wife when the powerful force hit their home. Relatives also named Tawauna Robinson. Her daughter Angeletta Santiago wrote on Facebook: 'Thanks to everyone for the kind words, prayers, and condolences. We have confirmed that my mother has been found and did not survive this deadly disaster... I just ask that you all please keep my family, my children, my siblings and I in your prayers.'","The bodies of Antonia Lee Candelaria and Emily Conatzer were found in Plaza Towers Elementary School .

"Ungraded: Cyrus Hanlon spent hours working after school on his coursework - but it was never sent off . A gifted student has missed out on a major qualification - after a teacher forgot to send his coursework off for marking. Cyrus Hanlon, from Bury in Greater Manchester, spent his after-school hours working to turn his national award in computing - worth the equivalent of two GCSEs - into a national certificate, worth four. The 16-year-old dedicated so much free time that he completed the course, which is meant to take two years, in just one. But he only found out about the blunder when he turned up at Castlebrook High School in Unsworth, Bury, expecting to pick up his award. Instead, the straight-A student - who hopes to go to Cambridge to study computer science - was told that his ICT teacher had forgotten to send four modules of his work to his examination board, OCR. Cyrus, who is currently studying A-levels in maths, further maths, physics and computing at Bury College, fears it could a blow to his ambition of getting into Cambridge. He said: 'My first reaction was to be really annoyed. I had done this course, which is meant to last two years, in one. 'I even went in outside of normal lessons to do the extra work, and it turns out it was for nothing. 'What makes it worse is that I was repeatedly assured that my work would be sent to the board on time.' All he has to show for it: Cyrus has a letter of commendation from Castlebrook High School, to perhaps show Cambridge University one day . In the past few weeks, Cyrus received 'a . letter of commendation' from the school admitting he had completed the . work for the full course. Mr Anthony Roberts, head teacher at Castlebrook, said: 'Unfortunately, the teacher responsible for submitting Cyrus's work for assessment was absent on a regular basis due to health problems. 'We have given Cyrus a letter confirming the situation should he need to explain this in the future.' A spokesman for OCR said: 'OCR sympathises with Cyrus and feels the situation is regrettable but would encourage the school to contact us to see if there is a way forward.'","Schoolboy Cyrus, 16, has his heart set on Cambridge University .

"Freedom to jog naked: Andrew Lyall Pointon, 47, won his appeal against offensive behaviour (stock picture) The right to go jogging in the nude has been upheld by the High Court in New Zealand. Andrew Lyall Pointon, 47, was wearing only a pair of shoes when he was spotted by a woman while running at 8.30am in a forest near Tauranga in August last year. She called police and he was arrested during another nude run. Pointon was charged with offensive behaviour and found guilty in Tauranga District Court last December. An appeal was thrown out in June, but a second appeal has just been upheld by Justice Paul Heath in the High Court at Tauranga. 'If it was [offensive] then God wouldn't have given us genitals,' Mr Pointon told The Dominion Post. 'It is a win for all libertarians and a setback for all conservatives in the country.' The judge, Justice Heath, compared the situation to passing 'gang members' walking through the park. He said: 'It . would not be surprising for a person in the position of the complainant . to be concerned and discomforted by their presence, and even to feel . threatened. 'However, on any view, their behaviour . would not be regarded as offensive behaviour. 'Should the sight of a . naked man, in the circumstances in which the complainant found herself, . be treated any differently? I think not.' He added that he felt Pointon was 'a genuine naturist' who had taken measures to avoid disturbing others - such as choosing a time when children would be unlikely to be on the track. But Family First spokesman Bob McCoskrie said he was disappointed and said Justice Heath's decision shows 'double standards'. He asked: 'Is it okay for someone to streak through his courtroom? He'd be the first one to put them in the cells.' Picturesque: The jogger was spotted close to Tauranga harbour in New Zealand . Naturist Mr Pointon said he enjoyed the freedom of not wearing clothes and began running naked about 18 months ago. The complainant, who was out walking her dog when she spotted Pointon, said she was so offended that she did not wish to ever return to the Oropi Bike Park. But Pointon lashed out at the woman who complained. He said: 'It's just ludicrous. Has this person got nothing better to do than wasting everyone's time? 'All she saw was a naked man running through the bush. It was just a fleeting moment, which has cost us all. 'It just shows that it was a stupid decision by police to go ahead ... and charge me for something totally irrelevant.'","Shocked complainant said she would never walk her dog in Oropi Park, New Zealand, again .

"The family of a 107-year-old woman say police treated them like criminals after they were accused of abducting her from a hospital. Officers demanded that Minetta Webb - who is the second-oldest woman in Britain - be handed over by her family, who had taken her home from Manchester Royal Infirmary just hours earlier. Hospital staff claimed Minetta was subject to a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguard (DoLS) order. The family of 107-year-old Minetta Webb (centre) say they were accused of abducting her from Manchester Royal Infirmary. Pictured are daughters Rosemary, 76 and Angela, 68, with grand-daughters Susan, 50 and D'borah, 53. These allow local authorities, care . homes and hospitals to restrict the freedom of vulnerable people if it is . 'in their best interests'. Minetta, who is the great-grandmother of Leeds United captain Lee Peltier, was being treated for an eye infection that had cleared, but after five weeks she developed bed sores. Her family decided she needed 24-hour care at home and claim doctors agreed to discharge Minetta, but they were stopped by hospital security while leaving with her. There was a scuffle and Minetta, who has eight children, 17 grandchildren, 28 great grandchildren and 10 great, great grandchildren, had to be carried into a waiting car before being taken home. But hospital staff dialled 999 and told police she had been abducted. Minetta's family were left speechless when officers arrived at the house she shares with her daughter Rosemary Peltier, 76, in Fallowfield, Manchester, to say they were taking her away. Minetta's granddaughter D'borah Peltier, 53, accused police of being 'heavy-handed'. She said: 'We were shocked when the police turned up and said Minetta had been abducted. 'One of them said: ""If you don't let us in to take gran back to hospital were going to have to boot the door down."" 'It was absolutely appalling. 'All we wanted to do was take Minetta home, because it was the best place for her to be looked after. 'I felt we've done nothing wrong and I can't understand why we've been treated like criminals.' Under protection: Manchester Royal Infirmary claimed Minetta was subject to a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguard (DoLS) order . The hospital claims that Minetta was subject to a DoLS order - but her family claim they have never been made aware of any order and police failed to obtain a copy from the hospital. Police were called to Minetta's home around 10pm on 28 June. The family claim that seven officers - in four different vehicles - turned up the address and the last officer didn't leave until 2.30am the next morning, despite a paramedic team advising that Minetta should remain there. Greater Manchester Police say they were forced to act after being contacted by the hospital. Chief Superintendent Rob Potts said: 'Police attended to check on the welfare of the woman and ensure that her needs were catered for, given the contents of the call made to us by the hospital. 'The officers have been spoken to and I am more than happy from the accounts provided that they acted with the utmost professionalism. 'Ultimately our priority was the same as the family's - the welfare and safety of the woman. 'Once this was established we were able to leave and allow the woman to remain at home.' He added that he 'strongly' rejected claims officers were heavy-handed. Minetta's family have accused social services of failing to provide her with adequate care package - forcing them to provide care themselves. One of her current carers is daughter Angela, 68, who lives in Florida. Minetta, is now improving after going 'downhill' in hospital, according to grand-daughter Susan Peltier. Susan, 50, said: 'The problem is social services didn't maintain a proper care package for Minetta. 'They've neglected her and that's why she ended up staying in hospital so long. 'We thought we'd come to an amicable agreement that would allow us to give her the 24-hour care she needs at home. 'It's disgraceful the way they've treated a 107-year-old woman. Support: Minetta with her daughters . Rosemary (left) and Angela, who lives in Florida . Great-grandson Lee, 26, added: 'I'm pretty disappointed at the way my family have been treated. 'I just want the best care for my gran and it's a massive achievement that she's lived so long.' A spokesperson for the Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said: 'An incident occurred on Friday, 28 June, when a patient was removed from one of our hospitals against our advice and in breach of a deprivation of liberty order, which had been put in place to protect and safeguard the interests of the patient concerned. Shocked: Grand-daughters D'borah and Susan and daughters Angela and Rosemary say they were left speechless when the police arrived . 'Greater Manchester Police was alerted of this incident in accordance with hospital /safeguarding protocols. 'Both the circumstances of this patient's removal from hospital and her ongoing care are the subject of ongoing investigation and review by Social Services, GMP and the Trust. 'We are therefore unable to comment further at this time.' Both the Care Quality Commission and the Mental Health Alliance have criticised DoLS, with the latter describing the system as 'not fit for purpose'.

"This was the scene today as a huge blaze broke out at an alcohol distillery - sending flames and smoke billowing 300ft into the air. Hundreds of terrified residents fled from their homes as the huge inferno spread through Alcohols Ltd in Oldbury, West Midlands, shortly before 10am. More than 80 firefighters were dispatched to the blaze, and eyewitnesses described hearing loud explosions as thick plumes of acrid smoke could be seen from more than 15 miles away.

A burns victim has been taken to hospital after the fire. A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed that a man in his 20s was treated at the scene for burn injuries before being taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. A fire service spokesman said a 100-metre cordon had been put in place around the scene as crews attempted to contain the blaze. Meanwhile, residents in the immediate vicinity are being asked to keep windows shut as a precaution. Ambulance crews remain at the scene, continuing to work alongside the other emergency services. The injured man was treated for burns to his hands and back, and given pain relief before being taken by land ambulance to a specialist burns unit. Residents - some clutching family pets - scrambled to safety as they tried to escape the path of the terrifying blaze. Incredibly, despite the ferocity of the blaze, just one man was taken to hospital after suffering burns to hands and back. West Midlands Fire Service sent 15 appliances to the scene of devastation as hundreds of residents were evacuated from nearby homes. Residents living nearby spoke of hearing a loud bang at the factory and fleeing their homes, with some still wearing pyjamas. Mother-of-two Neelam Dass, 37, said: . 'I heard a massive bang, I thought it was a car crash, but when I looked . out the window I saw the flames. 'I . grabbed my coat and shoes and ran out on to the street and knocked for . my neighbours to make sure they had got out. It’s just so scary, we just . ran.' Tracey Benoist, 47, who lives next . door to the factory, said: 'I was watching Jeremy Kyle and I heard a . massive bang. I ran up the stairs to look out my landing window. 'I grabbed my dog, a black Staffie called Lily and ran down the street.' Eyewitnesses described hearing explosions at the site, which is near to a level crossing, as locals reported seeing thick black smoke from several miles away . Scene from the sky: The Oldbury skyline was turned black by the raging inferno . Blazing away: Fifteen fire crews were scrambled in total to tackle the blaze, which could be seen for miles . Val Blakemore, 61, who lives opposite the factory had just come back from walking her dogs when she heard the explosion. She said: 'I heard a massive bang and looked out in front of the house and all I saw was the fire, it was terrifying. 'I tried to grab my cats and my dog . and get out of the house and my neighbour kicked down my back gate so I . could get out and I called the fire brigade and got me to a place of . safety. 'It’s absolutely terrifying, I’m so scared for my house.' Eyewitness . Ollie Clarke tweeted: 'When I took a picture as it exploded you could . actually feel the heat hit you - and I was at least 1,000 metres away.' Another witness said: 'We kept . hearing explosions and you can see the flames from the street. I have . never seen anything like it. 'People were screaming but you couldn’t tell whether it was inside the factory or not.' West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed one man had been treated for burn injuries and taken to hospital. Residents - some still in pyjamas - were evacuated from their homes to nearby schools and pubs as firefighters took over . More than 80 firefighters from 15 crews helped to put out the fire .

'An air ambulance from Cosford is also in attendance.' West Midlands Police closed roads around the area and said residents living 'within the vicinity of the fire' were being moved from their homes. The force have also scrambled their helicopter to help with surveillance as the fire service tried to get the blaze under control. Robert Ling, director of Alcohols Ltd, today confirmed there would be a lot of ethanol at the site of the fire. He said: 'We are aware of a fire at one of our sites and emergency services are in attendance. 'My senior colleagues are currently on their way to assess the situation. 'Early indications are that all our staff are accounted for but it is still early days. 'It is a dual purpose site, it is a gin distillery and we supply chemicals to a variety of distributors. 'So there will be a lot of ethanol on site as well as a variety of other chemicals.' The chemical distribution company was formed in 1955 and their head office is in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire. They describe themselves as one of the last independent gin distillers in the UK and say they use traditional copper pot stills which are over 100-years-old.","Terrified residents flee fireballs as alcohol distillery goes up in flames in Oldbury, West Midlands .

"A golf ball-sized meteor caused panic in a Welsh town when it exploded, creating a massive sonic boom.' Hundreds of people saw the fireball shoot across the night sky before it exploded near their homes in Cwmbran, near Newport, South Wales. Police and coastguards in South Wales had dozens of reports of a bright flash in the sky followed by a loud bang. Fireball: A meteor streaks across the night sky (file picture) Homeowner Steve Edwards, 56, said: 'There was an enormous boom - It sounded like a bomb going off. 'The force of it shook the windows in my house, woke up my children and caused car alarms to start going off in the streets. 'I’m just glad none of it landed on my roof.' The meteor was first spotted in the North West as it sped towards the border of Wales and the South West. It exploded in Cwmbran, near Newport, South Wales, pictured . Witness Nathan Jones, 34, who lives in nearby St Athan, said: 'I’ve never seen something so amazing in my life. 'It had a heat trail behind, it was orange and white and very bright, and also seemed very close. 'It looked like it was skimming through the atmosphere due to the curved path it was taking.' The meteor was first spotted in the North West and amateur astronomers watched as it sped towards the border of Wales and the South West. Shock: Police and coastguards in South Wales had dozens of reports of a bright flash in the sky followed by a loud bang after the golf-ball sized meteor exploded . Hannah Sabido, 33, who spotted the meteor from her home in Bristol, said: 'I first noticed it as a very bright glowing light behind cloud, travelling very fast. 'It looked like a bright white ball with a long bright tail and possibly a green hue. It was brighter than the moon. 'It became more orange towards the North East, giving off orange sparks before bursting out.' Astrophysician Dr David Whitehouse said: 'It was a piece of space rock coming into the earth’s atmosphere and burning up as it does. 'It’s the size of a golf ball, it’s coming in very, very quickly and leaving a bright tail as it vaporizes. 'It’s incredibly bright, it burns at an altitude of 60 to a 100 miles above the earth. 'So if one flashes across the UK you can see it all the way along its track even if it it only lasts a couple of seconds. 'It’s not unusual for it to be soon for a couple of 100 miles all across the country. 'Scientists will now be very keen to know if it’s survived so they can try and collect it and examine it. 'As for the rest of us we don’t have anything to fear from a meteor or this size, there’s no records of anyone having been killed by such a thing. 'It’s very, very unlikely to strike a person, much less likely than being struck by lightning. 'Very rarely something large will come into contact with the earth, like the one which helped the dinosaurs on it’s way - that was the size of Britain. 'But this meteor is a wonder of nature, something in the night sky to be admired and enjoyed.' Police in Wales confirmed they had dozens of reports of the meteor lighting up the night sky.","Fireball shot across the night sky before imploding in Cwmbran, near Newport, South Wales .

"NASA scientists believe that one of Jupiter's moons is the most likely place in the universe beyond the Earth that could harbour life. Europa, the sixth closest moon to the planet, is far more likely to be habitable than desert-covered Mars which has been the focus of recent US exploration, they say. It's ocean, thin shelf of ice and the presence of oxidants on Europa make it far more likely to be home to a life form than the red planet. Habitable? Scientists believe that there could be life on Europa, pictured, a moon of Jupiter. Now Nasa has set aside £14.6 million ($25 million) to design probes that could find out if life could thrive on the moon . Now NASA says it has revised plans to explore Europa, coming up with a cheaper way of completing its mission. Robert Pappalardo, a planetary scientist at NASA's jet propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, told France 24: 'Europa is the most promising in terms of habitability. 'It is the place we should be exploring now that we have a concept mission we think is the right one to get there for an affordable cost.' Speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual conference, Mr Pappalardo said that a new $2 billion exploration project called Clipper would see NASA team up with physicists from the John Hopkins University in Maryland if it gets the go ahead. Probe: A close up picture of Europa's surface taken by the Galileo probe in the 1990s . Promising: It's ocean, thin shelf of ice and the presence of oxidants on Europa make it far more likely to be home to a life form than the desert covered plains of the red planet, say scientists . The mission follows the success of Cassini, a probe that closely explored Titan - a moon of Saturn. NASA will send a spacecraft into Jupiter's orbit and conduct a number of close flybys of Europa. Mr Papparlardo says that exploring Europa using the flyby method will allow scientists to explore the moon in its entirety. Clipper could be launched by 2021 and would take a further three to six years to reach Europa. But NASA announced late last year that there are currently no funds for the mission. Frozen: A system of ridges and cracks on the icy surface of Jupiter's moon Europa is shown in this NASA photo released in 1998 . In orbit: Europa is one of Jupiter's four Galilean moons . Instead, it will send a new robot to Mars in 2020, similar to Curiosity, the craft which has been exploring the surface of the planet since last August, at a cost of around $2.5 billion. The probe Juno is to arrive in the orbit of Jupiter in 2016, but after it is crashed a year later, the US will have no probe's in the outlying reachers of the solar system. It could however, team up with the European Space Agency which plans to launch a mission to Jupiter in 2030. Europa was first examined by the Voyager mission in 1979 and by Galileo in the 1990s. As well as Europa, scientists believe that Encelade, a moon belonging to Saturn, could also be habitable. Fresh focus: Mars has been the focus of US searches for life on other planets in recent years. Shown is a picture sent back to NASA by the Curiosity Mars rover, which has been examining the red planet since August 2012 . Europa has very few craters on its surface . Europa is the sixth closest moon to Jupiter and the smallest of the four Galilean satellites that belong to the planet. It was discovered by Galileo Galilei in January 1610 and is named after a Phoenician noblewoman in Greek mythology who was courted by Zeus and became the Queen of Crete. Europa orbits Jupiter in around three-and-a-half days with an orbital radius of 670,900km.

"Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne looked down in the dumps as he put his bins out in what is his first public appearance since he was sectioned following an alcohol meltdown. The 47-year-old looked downcast when he was spotted wearing a blue dressing gown, tartan pyjama bottoms and slip-on shoes outside his property in Poole, Dorset. The former midfielder, who was sectioned for his own safety last month, was also sporting scars to his face following a recent fall while he carried out the chore at 1pm on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne looked down in the dumps as he put his bins out in Poole, Dorset . The former midfielder looked downcast as he carried out the chore in his dressing gown and pyjama bottoms . It is the first time Gascoigne, who retired from football in 2004, has been pictured in public since being sectioned under the Mental Health Act on October 24. The star was placed on a three-day emergency detox after being rushed to hospital in the early hours following an apparent alcohol binge. He is now said to be recovering at home with his new 44-year-old girlfriend Mandy Thomas, who he only recently started seeing. She is said to have vowed to stand by him and is helping him with his recovery. Less than 48 hours prior to his hospitalisation last month, the pair were pictured out and about and onlookers said they had been discussing their plans for the future. They are said to have met after the former Newcastle, Tottenham and Rangers star visited the post office she runs in Bournemouth, Dorset. The star was placed on a three-day emergency detox last month after being rushed to hospital in the early hours following an apparent alcohol binge. He is now said to be recovering at home with his new girlfriend . It is the first time Gascoigne, who retired from football in 2004, has been pictured in public since being sectioned under the Mental Health Act on October 24. He has suffered a lengthy battle with alcoholism . Ms Thomas, who is separated from her husband and has two children, is said to be 'besotted' with the star with whom she has become 'inseparable'. She reportedly helped him move into his new apartment in the expensive area of Sandbanks in Poole in August. It was shortly after he was released from Poole Hospital after another alcoholic breakdown that he was found slumped outside his flat clutching a bottle of gin. Friends said the new couple viewed the move as a fresh start and said that Ms Thomas hopes to help him through the most recent 'setback'.

Ms Thomas (right) is supporting him . The 47-year-old star was rushed to hospital at 3am on October 24 and sectioned under the Mental Health Act . The football ace has suffered a long battle with alcoholism and was previously sectioned six years ago. The star, who made 57 appearances for his country, has been in rehab seven times and was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008, following an incident at a Newcastle hotel. His seventh stint in rehab was in January this year when he checked into a £6,000-a-month treatment clinic in Southampton. Last month, the star was pictured cradling a chicken while enjoying a pint and speaking to locals in a pub beer garden. At the time of his hospitalisation, Gascoigne's agent Terry Baker told MailOnline that the star 'is not very well' but refused to comment on his condition any further.

"A computer hacking gang, who caused major companies multi-million pound losses, boasted there was 'next to zero' chance they would be caught, a court heard. The group, taking action on behalf of the 'Anonymous' protest group, brought down websites belonging to PayPal and Mastercard by flooding them with messages and requests under the banner 'Operation Payback'. The gang even discussed hacking pop star Lily Allen's website in revenge for her stance on anti-piracy, Southwark Crown Court heard. Northampton University student . Christopher Weatherhead, 22, who used the online handle 'Nerdo', is on . trial accused of playing an 'integral role' in the attacks. Ashley . Rhodes, 28, Peter Gibson, 24, and an 18-year-old who cannot be named, . have already admitted their roles in the conspiracy. Anonymous attack: Ashley Rhodes (left), 26, has pleaded guilty to one conspiracy charge, while Christopher Weatherhead, 21, (right) is pleading not guilty . Pleading guilty: Peter Gibson, 23, appearing in court . Prosecutor Sandip Patel said online forums contained instruction manuals for Anonymous supporters to join 2010 attacks and evade capture. 'One user asked what would happen if they got caught', he told jurors. 'It says the chances are next to zero because so many are doing it. You simply deny knowing what they are talking about, or say you have been infected by a virus. 'If you try to do this alone, the chances are much higher you will get caught.' The campaign originally targeted music industry bodies to avenge their anti-piracy stance, but the gang began to focus on firms who refused to process payments to Julian Assange's Wikileaks organisation. The online payments firm PayPal suffered losses of £3.5million, while sites belonging to Mastercard and recording industry bodies were also forced offline. Weatherhead is accused of bragging online to a fellow hacker: 'We have probably done some million pound of damage to mc [Mastercard]'. Anyone who tried to visit the sites was directed to a webpage displaying the message: 'You've tried to bite the Anonymous hand. You angered the hive and now you are being stung'. Anonymous held an online countdown to the start of co-ordinated attacks, telling their followers: 'Charging your lasers, remember don't start shooting until the time.' Investigator DC Trevor Dickey said police found several 'press releases' from the hackers attempting to explain their actions. 'They had what I referred to as press releases, where they sought to justify why it is they do the things that they do', he said. He added: 'It was to cause as much disruption to whether it be an organisation or company which had a website. 'They tried to take them offline so they couldn't function as an entity.' Jurors heard Weatherhead was an administrator of Anonymous sites which urged followers to carry out distributed denial of services attacks (DDoS) against the companies. DDoS attacks work by paralysing a computer system by flooding it with an 'intolerable number of online requests and messages', the court heard. The hackers sent 'DDOS' attacks to site such as PayPal - which prevented customers making transactions . MasterCard websites were also taken offline, the court heard . Weatherhead and his three co-conspirators are said to be a 'small cabal of leaders' for attacks between September 2010 and January 2011. 'Press releases' posted by Anonymous were played to jurors in which the group begged the public not to be angry with their actions. 'Please do not despise use', it said. 'We ask you to consider the value of freed of information for you and future generations. 'We ask you to consider the implications of information censorship through the Internet or free speech. 'Consider the future of our human rights. Those you want to take these rights from you will not stop with this.' The group promised to continue 'until our proverbial dying breath' to tackle what it described as 'atrocities' committed by large firms against free speech. Among its instructions to supporters was to distribute the controversial Wikileaks cables across the Internet so that more people could read them. Weatherhead denies one count of conspiracy to impair the operation of computers between August 1, 2010 and January 27 last year. Rhodes, from Camberwell, southeast London, Gibson, from Hartlepool, and the 18-year-old, of Chester, have pleaded guilty to the same charge. The trial continues.

"Six years of hard luck stories have finally been put to bed. It was beautiful and ugly in equal measures at the Millennium Stadium as Wales at last overcame their demons to secure the most tense and precious of victories over South Africa. There was to be no more choking in Cardiff - even if there were moments when Wales looked like coughing up their six-point lead. There were to be no more late slip-ups that have so often been part of the script in the previous run of 22 defeats by the Southern Hemisphere powerhouses. Wales have a history of making life difficult for themselves in these big games. Again they rode their luck, but four penalties from full back Leigh Halfpenny proved enough to get Warren Gatland’s side over that elusive line. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Wales 12-6 South Africa . Wales captain Sam Warburton celebrates after winning the match against South Africa at the Millennium Stadium .

South Africa: le Roux, Hendricks, Serfontein, de Villiers, Mvovo, Lambie, Reinach, Mtawarira, B. du Plessis, Oosthuizen, Etzebeth, Matfield, Coetzee, Mohoje, Vermeulen . Replacements: Strauss, Nyakane, Redelinghuys, de Jager, Carr, Hougaard, Pollard, de Allende . Referee: John Lacey (Ireland) ‘They don’t make it easy on the coaches,’ said Gatland. ‘I couldn’t watch the last ten minutes. I was watching it in the box on the TV. We took a different approach to this autumn and I think we’re the only country that had the confidence or the courage to do that. We’ve wounded one of the big beasts and they will come back fighting even harder next time.’ It was one of those ‘pinch yourself’ moments. Wales had one previous win in 108 years and 29 Tests against the Rainbow Nation, but now the monkey is off their back. With less than 12 months until the World Cup, the psychological boost will be invaluable. No more talk of ‘hoodoos’ and just, in the words of skipper Sam Warburton, talk about moving forwards. ‘We’ve been in that position so many times that it didn’t feel alien,’ said Warburton. ‘There was more talk in that last five minutes than I’ve ever heard. That’s where we’ve made mistakes in the past. For me this is a career highlight. Now we’ve set the standard and we need to kick on.’ Wales started with intent, fly half Dan Biggar setting the early standard with some sublime handling. They retained possession through 12 phases and, after Rhys Webb was taken out off the ball, Halfpenny kicked his first penalty to open the scoring. But South Africa No 10 Pat Lambie quickly levelled from 46 metres. The hosts enjoyed more possession in the opening quarter but aggressive counter-rucking from the Springboks acted to stem the flow of attack. Not even a 15-man line-out could push Wales over the line as their opponents absorbed all pressure. Beautiful it was not, with the half time score level, as had been the case against both Australia and New Zealand. South Africa's captain Jean de Villiers is carried off the field on a stretcher .

Wales take little comfort from what has occurred before. There was a cynical feeling of inevitability around the Millennium Stadium but some of those demons were eased when Sam Warburton won a 47th-minute penalty, which was kicked by Halfpenny to put his side back in front, although again it was cancelled out by Lambie. It was turning into an arm wrestle; an ugly scrap offering more tension than spectacle. Again the responsibility fell on Halfpenny to keep the scoreboard rolling and two penalties from the Lions star, one following an unstoppable drive from the Welsh scrum, put his side six points ahead with less than half an hour remaining. Physicality is part and parcel of this fixture and Boks skipper Jean de Villiers was the first to drop, with the 105-cap centre requiring an oxygen supply as he was carted off with a dislocated kneecap. When winger Cornal Hendricks was shown a yellow card in the 63rd minute for taking out Halfpenny in the air, it looked like fortune might finally be about to favour the Welsh. ‘The yellow card was a turning point because we had to go into defensive mode,’ said Springboks head coach Heyneke Meyer. ‘I don’t know if it’s worthwhile going up in the air anymore because it’s always going to be 50-50. It’s a grey area that we need to sort out. The referee is always right and we have to face that.’ This was the time to turn the screw. Wales pushed and pushed but, with the line at his mercy, hooker Scott Baldwin fell just short. If South Africa were going to come back, that would be the costly moment. Memories of Nelspruit, when Wales coughed up a 17-point lead, began to creep in. Springbok full-back Willie le Roux was their tormentor in June but, against the odds, the gifted No 15 was guilty of the an amateur handling error on his own five-metre line. Still Wales failed to capitalise and, with Hendricks back on the field, errors began to creep into their game. All of a sudden South Africa are camped deep in opposition territory but Wales held on, just, to secure one of their most famous victories.

"The battle over web freedom and controls is set to take place over the next 11 days, with 193 countries gathering to discuss the future of internet regulation. When the United Nations delegates last . met to discuss the laws of the virtual land, it was 1988, and the Internet was pretty . much unheard of within the general public. At that time, Google was still a twinkle in the eyes of two 15-year-olds, auctions could only be won if you attended in person, and Amazon was a river in South America. Now that the Internet is an everyday commodity for much of the world, the talks, starting today in Dubai, will see a variety of viewpoints raised. Some nations, including Russia. having previously pressed for internet controls and censorship, while others, including a U.S. delegation, pressing for web freedom. Time to conference call: Participants listen to the speech of Hamdoun Toure, Secretary General of the International Telecommunication, at the Dubai conference . Some delegates at the Dubai conference - including a 123-member U.S. delegation with envoys from tech giants such as Google and Microsoft - worry that any new U.N. ruling could be used by nations such as China and Russia to justify further tightening of Web blocks and monitoring. Even Google got political as the . conference started, placing a message on its homepage today which reads: . 'Love the free and open Internet? Tell . the world's governments to keep it that way'. The 11-day conference highlights the . fundamental shift from tightly-managed telecommunications networks to . the borderless sweep of the Internet. The Dubai gathering will confront questions that include how much sway the U.N. can exert over efforts such as battling cyber-crimes and expanding the Internet into developing nations. The secretary-general of the U.N. International Telecommunications Union, Hamadoun Toure, said that accusations how the meeting could limit Web freedoms is 'completely untrue' and predicted only 'light-touch' regulations. Google gets political: The search engine posted a link as it campaigned to keep the Internet regulation-free . 'Many countries will come to reaffirm their desire to see freedom of expression embedded in this conference,' he told reporters on the meeting's opening day. However, the outcome of the Dubai gathering is far from certain. The 193 nations at the meeting have put forward more than 900 proposed regulatory changes covering the Internet, mobile roaming fees and satellite and fixed-line communications. Broad consensus is needed for any item to be adopted for any changes - the first major review of the U.N.'s telecommunications agenda since 1988, well before the Internet age. The gathering is also powerless to force nations to change their Internet policies, such as China's notorious 'Great Firewall' and widespread blackouts of political opposition sites in places including Iran and the Gulf Arab states. Last week, Syria's Internet and telephone services disappeared for two days during some of the worst fighting in months to hit the capital, Damascus. Switch on: Any attempts for increased Web regulations are likely to face stiff opposition from groups led by a major U.S. delegation . The head of the U.S. delegation in Dubai, Ambassador Terry Kramer, told reporters last week in Washington that all efforts should be made to avoid a 'Balkanization' of the Internet in which each country would impose its own rules and standards that could disrupt the flow of commerce and information. 'That opens the door ... to content censorship,' he said. The International Trade Union Confederation, representing labor groups in more than 150 countries, claimed a bloc that includes China, Russia and several Middle East nations seeks to 'pave the way for future restrictions on both internet content or its users.' 'It is clear that some governments have an interest in changing the rules and regulations of the Internet,' the confederation said in statement Monday. Another likely battle that will take place in Dubai is over European-backed suggestions to change the pay structure of the Web to force content providers - such as Google, Facebook Inc. and others - to kick in an extra fee to reach users across borders. Advocates of the changes say the money raised could pay to expand broadband infrastructures in developing countries. Toure said he hoped for a 'landmark' accord on trying to bring broadband Internet to developing countries. 'The Internet remains out of reach for 2/3 of world's people,' said Toure, who is from Mali. The U.N. telecommunications agency dates back to 1865, when the telegraph revolutionized the speed of information. Over the decades, it has expanded to include telephone, satellite and other advances in communications.","Some nations, including Russia, call for laws to allow state censorship .

"The death of Richard Simmons' beloved pet dog is reportedly the reason behind his depression. Yesterday reports emerged the fitness fanatic had become a recluse in his Hollywood mansion and has not been seen in public for months. And it was the death of his Dalmatian Hattie aged 17 in January - within days of his last public sighting - that drove him to despair, a source told TMZ. He had several Dalmatians but Hattie had been the last survivor. The source added Simmons, who never had any children, would take the dog out with him in Los Angeles and treated him like a child. But his housekeeper has denied claims that he's suffering from 'debilitating depression' and says he is 'perfectly fine'. Scroll down for video . Richard Simmons posted this picture of his Dalmation captioned 'Look at my Hattie.............xoxoxoxo' on Twitter in April last year . On Thursday, TMZ reported that eighties fitness guru Richard Simmons hasn't been seen in a year and has been spent that time holed up in his Los Angeles home, depressed over a knee surgery that could leave him without the ability to exercise. Pictured above in November 2013 at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade . It has also been said that Simmons is in desperate need of a knee replacement and risks never being able to exercise again if he continues to avoid the routine procedure. A source told TMZ: 'Doctors told Richard he needs a left knee replacement and if he doesn't get it he will never be able to exercise again.' Simmons is allegedly 'paralyzed with fear and depression' as pressure grows to have the operation which sparked his reclusive behavior in 2014, TMZ say. However a housekeeper who lives on the property insists there was nothing to worry about regarding Simmons' physical or mental health when speaking to MailOnline today. The housekeeper, named Teresa Reveles, is allegedly tasked with turning friends or associates away when they come to visit him, said: 'He's perfectly fine. He's home and he's fine.' It comes as Simmons himself took to social media to thank fans for their 'outpouring of love and concern' following the surprising news of his well-being. In a post on his official Facebook page he said: 'I am so touched by the outpouring of love and concern that I have received today. I have had a tough time dealing with this injury, as it is keeping me from doing what I truly love to do and that is to teach classes around the world.' Reynold Gideon, who lives directly opposite, tells MailOnline exclusively that Simmons' housekeeper is adamant the sparkling fitness fanatic is merely 'resting'. MailOnline talked to Simmons' housekeeper outside his Los Angeles (above) home on Thursday, and she said he is 'perfectly fine' and not depressed as reported . A woman stands behind a gate at Simmons' Los Angeles mansion on Thursday, November 13 . Mr Gideon confirmed that Simmons had issues with his knee but believes he's doing well and is most likely to be working on something new, he understands from many conversations with the gym guru's staff. Mr Gideon explained: 'I think he's working on a new project, he's constantly recreating himself because the man has so much energy. He's a wonderful neighbor to have.' 'He told me about a knee problem months ago but I've not seen him since so I don't know of any updates with it,' Mr Gideon explained. One concerned neighbor pulled over their vehicle to ask MailOnline if the dazzling star had died, such is his absence in the community. The woman, who declined to be named, enquired: 'Is he dead? We're all quite worried, nobody has seen him in months. It's so out of character but nobody knows what to do.' An unidentified man arrived at the property to hand-deliver documents in an 8.5 by 11-inch brown envelope, received by Simmons' housekeeper, but refused to comment regarding the nature of his visit. Simmons pictured at a students' exercise symposium in 2004, wearing his trademark shorts and tank top. The eccentric entertainer hasn't been seen in public for almost a year . Simmons was last seen in public on January 11 at a charity event and has avoided his own famed studio 'Slimmons' in Beverly Hills for several months. Since his 80s heyday Simmons has constantly sought to regain his faded fame, and can be easily recognized in LA by his bushy hair and trademark exercise shorts and tank top. In 2011, the fitness guru had Dancing With The Stars viewers talking about his seemingly slimmed down build whist appearing on the show to coach celebrity contestant Chaz Bono. The 63-year-old's smaller frame sparked speculation that something was awry, and perhaps he might even be ill - though this speculation was later quashed by his agent. Simmons continues to run the Beverley Hills exercise studio, called Slimmons Studio, that he established in 1974. MailOnline reached out to Simmons for comment.","Today, reports surfaced saying eccentric fitness guru Richard Simmons had not been seen in public for months .

Six months after ringleader Michael Vagnini was sentenced to just 26 months in prison for the crimes, Jeffrey Dollhopf and Brian Kozelek were given the small fine and ordered to perform 100 hours and 20 hours respectively of community service. Both officers pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct as a party to the crime in October and quit the police department in early December as part of a plea agreement. The pair were facing a maximum sentence of 90 days in jail but their attorneys stressed that neither were ever charged with ordering or conducting the strip searches. They were, however, present when the grim probes took place.

Accomplices: Brian Kozelek, right, was given the small fine and ordered to perform 20 hours of community service. A fourth officer, Jacob Knight, left, took a plea deal in which he agreed to resign from the department and was sentenced in October to 20 days in jail, 60 hours of community service and a $300 fine . According to the Journal Sentinel, . prosecutors said in the proceedings that the two men should have acted . to stop Vagnini, who been sentenced to just over two years in . prison.

A . fourth officer, Jacob Knight, took a plea deal in which he agreed to . resign from the department and was sentenced in October to 20 days in . jail, 60 hours of community service and a $300 fine. According . to The Journal Sentinel, one victim said that an officer put a gun . to his head while Vagnini administered a choke hold, touched his . scrotum and put his fingers in his anus. Another man was probed so . violently that he bled, a court heard. Wisconsin . law clearly prohibits police officers from administering cavity . searches. Only medical professionals may do so, and only when authorized . by a warrant. But Vagnini . even conducted the illegal search a 15-year-old boy, touching his anus . and genitals during a traffic stop in December of 2011. The JS . documented at least a dozen similar instances of Vagnini performing . invasive, illegal searches on black men. Two years: Ringleader Michael Vagnini, pictured center in June, pleaded no contest to four felonies and four misdemeanors for inflicting abhorrently invasive cavity searches on dozens of male drug suspects. he received two years in prison . The assaults happened over two years, according to a criminal complaint. The . victims, identified only by their initials, told prosecutors the . officers searched them between February 2010 and February 2012. Prosecutors . say the stories are strikingly similar: The men allege that Vagnini . stopped them, placed his hand down their pants and probed their anus or . shifted their genitals, saying he was looking for drugs. Milwaukee . County District Attorney John Chisholm charged Vagnini with 25 counts, . including conducting an illegal strip search, misconduct in office, . sexual assault and conducting an illegal body cavity search. One of the victims testified under oath that officers stopped him in July 2011. Vagnini . pinched his anus, causing him to yell out 'Man, what are you doing? Don't touch me like that! You can't be doing that!' Vagnini replied with . words to the effect of 'Be a man and give it up.' Vagnini . took the man to a room in a district police station, throwing a box in . the room and told him if he defecated once in the box he would let him . go. The man tried to . comply, investigators said in the complaint, but couldn't and was . released with a ticket for driving with a suspended license. Disgusted: Chief Edward Flynn told reporters at the time: 'Quite frankly I'm disgusted by the willful action of some of the officers of our police department' Officers . Dollhopf and Kozelek were in the room but did nothing to stop the . proceedings and didn't report Vagnini to a supervisor, the complaint . said. A similar scenario . allegedly took place that September, when Vagnini took a man he stopped . to a room in the same police station after saying 'I want to see what . he's got in his butt.' He allegedly inserted his finger into the man's anus, prompting the man to call out 'This ain't right! Call my attorney!' Vagnini then told the man to get the drugs out on his own, gave him a garbage can and had the man push the drugs out and place them into the can. The complaint did not specify what type of drugs the man was hiding but said Dollhopf and Officer Jacob Knight were in the room and didn't try to stop Vagnini or report him. Another victim testified that, in February, Vagnini saw him coming out of his aunt's house, cuffed him, and then searched his anus. When the man tried to pull away, Vagnini put him in a chokehold. Two officers held his arms and one pressed a gun to his head, the victim said. Chief Edward Flynn is under fire following the abhorrent scandal. He told reporters at the time: 'Quite frankly I'm disgusted by the willful action of some of the officers of our police department. 'And I'm appalled by the willful inaction of some other officers in our police department in failing to stop egregious conduct. There's no justification for this.'","Jeffrey Dollhopf and Brian Kozelek were given the small fine and ordered to perform 100 hours and 20 hours respectively of community service .

"Superclubs and fishbowls are being phased out by holiday company Thomson as it launches a new range of holidays aimed at young travellers who want a more classy trip abroad. Thomson Scene is aimed at 18-35-year-olds keen something more sophisticated than boozing up and baking on the beach, and will eventually replace their current 2wenty concept. 'We are aiming at a young person who is, typically about two years into a new job, perhaps working in London and enthusiastic about trendy hotels,' said David Burling, UK and Ireland managing director for Thomson's parent company Tui UK. Thomson has launched a new brand that offers holidays to young travellers who want more than Magluf . New destinations include Goa in India and Santorini in Greece, though regular party locales will still be offered . The portfolio will be separated into 'Scene Hub' for the younger end of the spectrum with more affordable hotels in popular destinations, and 'Scene Style', for the more cashed-up travellers who want more trendy accommodation. The move is a departure from the large, uniform, all-inclusive style hotels that are often offered as part of the company's portfolio for younger travellers. The Club 18-30 concept was actually created by Thomas Cook, but has equivalents at various tour operators, such as the 2wenty concept from Thomson, which is being phased out in favour of Thomson Scene. Young Britons' lurid behaviour in resort havens such as Spain's Magaluf was highlighted last summer with cheap dorm accommodation and even cheaper alcohol on the menu for most. Thomson is aiming at the market who wants more from their holiday with their packages now set to  include the Greek resorts of Santorini and Mykonos along with Croatia for short-haul trips. Long-haul destinations will include Thailand, Goa in India and Cancun in Mexico. Thomson Scene offers more trendy hotels than those currently included in their holidays . Despite the rebranding Thomson continues to supply holidays for 18 to 35-year-olds to party-scene hotspots  like Ibiza and Corfu and in total is providing breaks in 86 hotels in 34 resorts in 20 destinations. The company's announcement came in the Slovenian capital Ljubljana where travel association Abta is holding its annual convention. An Abta survey released today showed that three per cent of UK men had been on an overseas stag-party event, with men preferring city breaks for their stag dos while women opted for beach destinations for their overseas hen parties.","Thomson Scene offers trendy hotels instead of regular all-inclusive styles .

"Supersonic skydiver Felix Baumgartner has been found guilty of punching a Greek lorry driver in the face in a road rage incident in his home town of Salzburg, Austria two years ago. Baumgartner, who last month broke the world record altitude for a parachute jump in the Red Bull Stratos project, had appealed against the conviction for assault but a three-judge appeals panel today upheld the verdict. Baumgartner, 43, was fined 1,500 euros but escaped jail for the assault on September 30, 2010. Convicted: World record sky diver Felix Baumgartner was found guilty of assaulting a Greek lorry driver in his home town of Salzburg, Austria two years ago in an appeal hearing held today . Record breaker: Just last month, Baumgartner, 43, set a new record for the highest parachute jump when he fell from a height of 24 miles at a speed of 834mph . The victim, named only as Dimitrios P, 38, for legal reasons, told Austrian media that the punch came 'out of the blue' and left 'blood everywhere'. He said: 'I was waiting at a roundabout and there were about four cars in front of me. He didn't want to wait and overtook us all and then of course got wedged on the roundabout. 'The other driver that was involved was his photographer - and he felt that he could also do the same and followed Mr Baumgartner, at which point I decided to have a work with the photographer. 'Mr Baumgartner decided that it was his job to get involved and he tried to claim I had attacked him and it was self-defence, but this is madness. 'There were two of them. The reality is that he punched me full in the face with his fist and left me with a cut. Falling to earth: Baumgartner, seen here during his record jump, punched the Greek lorry driver in the face following an argument, leaving 'blood everywhere' Flashpoint: The assault happened when Baumgartner overtook the lorry, which was queuing at a roundabout . 'There was blood everywhere. I never tried to conceal anything at the court - I admitted that I had tried to kick him but it was only in retaliation. 'He was just acting the tough guy and showing off and making himself the hero, but he isn't a hero at all.' He added that he was glad people could see what Mr Baumgartner, a former boxer, was really like. Dimitrios said that after hitting him, Mr Baumgartner returned to his car and drove off. In the original trial the court chose to believe the version of events put forward by the Greek man rather than that of Baumgartner and the German photographer. Charged: Baumgartner, who didn't attend the appeal hearing because he is on a speaking tour, was fined 1,500 euros but escaped a jail term . Baumgartner was not present during today's court hearing as he is currently on a tour talking about his adventures. On October 24, he jumped from a helium balloon at an altitude of 39km (24 miles), reaching an estimated speed of 1,342km/h (834mph) and breaking the sound barrier during his descent, the first person to do so. In the process, he established new records for the highest manned balloon flight, the parachute jump from the highest altitude and the greatest free fall velocity.","Baumgartner, 43, fined 1,500 euros by judges in appeal hearing, but escapes jail term .

"Erica Camus prepares for a walk in the forest . Rummaging through charity shops, going for a walk through the forest, tending to my little potted garden, or enjoying every bite of a six-course meal at the 17th Century Weston Park with my partner – these are all things that make me feel happy. I do them as often as I can (well, the last one was a pretty special occasion, to be honest). I list these things because, for me, moments to savour have been hard-won. I have paranoid schizophrenia and have even spent time on a psychiatric ward. I’ll be on medication for the rest of my life. Today, I am largely recovered (the psychiatric term is in remission). I’m committed to my care plan – things I do to maintain my stability, which I devised with my community psychiatric nurse. Alongside tablets, I have weekly psychotherapy sessions, and considering the things that make me happy – in fact, I write them in a journal – is part of this. It’s a simple trick but highly effective, and both listing them and taking time out to actually do them is part of a type of therapy called compassion-focused therapy (CFT), which I have written about before in The Mail on Sunday. Increasingly, research shows that counting our blessings can have a positive effect on a range of mental illnesses, including depression and anxiety, which affect millions of Britons. MADE TO MEASURE . Happiness is a buzzword. In 2010, David Cameron announced his plans to invest £2 million in creating a ‘happiness index’. The scheme, run by the Office of National Statistics, is supposed to give another measure of how well we are doing as a nation, besides just looking at the economy. Other countries do this, and when you suspend your cynicism for a moment, it does make good sense – after all, we know money doesn’t buy happiness. According to the latest results, 33 per cent of UK adults rated their happiness at a ‘very high level’ last year, which was an increase of two per cent on the previous year. Research published earlier this year from the San Diego School of Medicine revealed that 37 per cent of schizophrenic patients were happy most or all of the time. That compared with 83 per cent of ‘normal’ respondents. A worrying 15 per cent of the former group said they were never or rarely happy, while no one in the comparison group ticked that box. On one hand, this shows that happiness and living with serious mental illness needn’t be an oxymoron. But happiness is clearly more of a struggle for some of us. Everything's rosy: Erica tends to the plants at her home and says she savours such simple moments . And the pursuit of it has become something of an obsession. More than 50,000 books are listed on Amazon with the word ‘happy’ in the title. Many of them are self-help books, perhaps geared towards making us happy. Making my own happy book, in which I record the good things in life – whether they are kind words from friends and family, or lovely memories – serves the same purpose. It’s part of my own CFT, which I started earlier this year. Having tried other so-called ‘talking treatments’ including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness, I have found the approach works really well. Of course, whether it suits you is highly personal, but for the past five years CFT has been offered on the NHS for people with a variety of mental health problems. Like mindfulness, it’s largely inspired by Buddhism but also has its roots in CBT, which helps patients change the way they think and therefore behave. As Professor Paul Gilbert, one of the pioneers of the method, explains: ‘It’s similar to CBT, which works by helping patients to consider their negative thoughts and come to more realistic alternative views. ‘But while CBT focuses on changing behaviour in a neutral, practical way – such as using timesheets to plan the day more productively – in CFT the focus is more on being kind to yourself.’ LIFTING THE GLOOM . If this all sounds rather Polyanna-ish (and I’m not ashamed to say I’m a fan of the book and films), experts are quick to point out this isn’t simply a matter of saying ‘Think happy thoughts and you’ll feel better’. Bargain hunt: Erica says sorting through the racks at a charity shop is one of the things that make her happy . As Dr Martin Seligman, the father of ‘positive psychology’, says: ‘Psychotherapy traditionally is where you go to talk about your troubles, [but it can also be where you] go to talk about positive emotion, your strengths and virtues, and how to build more meaning into your life.’ His methods have been shown in placebo-controlled trials to have an impact on symptoms of depression. In one such trial, 500 healthy volunteers were recruited to take a range of online tests while undergoing a ‘wellbeing evaluation’ over a six-month period. One of the exercises that proved most beneficial in terms of boosting mood was ‘three blessings’: each day, participants were asked to write down three things that went well that day, and say why. This test was given to depressed patients. An astonishing 94 per cent of severely depressed people became less depressed, and 92 per cent said they became happier, with an average symptom relief of a whopping 50 per cent. A control group, which was not given the exercise, did not have the same turnaround. One of the symptoms of my illness, which started in my teenage years (I’m now 34), is that I become consumed by the idea that I have done something dreadfully wrong, to the point where I won’t leave the house. I have found in the past that therapy that required me to focus on the negative things in my upbringing, for instance, was almost traumatic. So, given that I have a tendency to feel so bad about myself, it’s no surprise CFT is a boon – and I believe it could well be for anyone whose mental illness might lead to similar feelings of causeless guilt or self-hate. It’s worth chatting to your GP if you feel it might be right for you. TRAIN THE BRAIN . Of course, being unhappy is not reserved for psychiatric patients such as myself. Suzanna Halonen, a Surrey-based coach, trainer and self-proclaimed ‘Happyologist’, says that happiness is a challenge for everyone. She explains: ‘Often people forget about happiness and think it’s something they can delay until retirement. But in fact you can choose to be happy every day. It’s a bit like a habit and you can train your brain, just like you work out muscles in the gym. Your brain can become stronger in its positivity, making optimism more natural.’ Labour MP David Lammy, who is chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Wellbeing Economics, agrees, saying: ‘In Britain, public satisfaction with life has hardly changed since 1970. Despite all the social, technological and medical advances we have made since then, we are still no happier or more fulfilled as a nation. ‘That should be a real concern for our national leaders and can involve anything from campaigning for fair pay to promoting good planning in new houses and finding ways to tap into the potential benefits of things like positive psychotherapy.’ As well as choosing to spend time doing things I enjoy and listing them, I keep a folder containing treasured letters and emails, which I have printed out, and mementos and greeting cards that have brought a smile to my face. If a rain cloud of unhappiness does float along, I take refuge in this folder – something I work hard to keep up to date. I force myself to read it cover to cover, and once I’ve finished, my mood always changes dramatically. It works a little like an umbrella giving me shelter when a cloud blackens my mental sphere. But I’m sure everyone would benefit from spending some time working towards a happy state of mind. If I can do it, anyone can.","Erica has paranoid schizophrenia and has spent time on psychiatric ward .

"An Englishman on holiday in Spain a century ago found a country with little to recommend it. Waking up on the first morning and consulting his guide book, he would have read the following description: ‘Spain is a bleak and often arid land, with few traces of picturesqueness.’ The towns, the guide continues, are wreathed in tobacco smoke and the cafes are ‘very deficient in comfort and cleanliness’. The guide further warns that the service from waiters, chambermaids and porters is generally very slack and that the traveller should always count his change. In the Spanish countryside there is great danger of highway robbery, while in the cities the police will arrest anyone they can lay their hands on. Donkey work: Edwardian tourists riding on donkeys and camela with their native guides at the Sphinx at Giza, Egypt in 1910 . The railway carriages and omnibuses are so filthy that a clothes brush, a duster and some insect powder should always be at hand. As for the national sport of bull fighting, it is ‘the most unsportsmanlike and cowardly spectacle’ a civilised man will ever see. This is the account of Spain given in the 1914 Baedeker Guide. These small, red books, bound in leather, were the first recourse for an Englishman abroad in the late 19th and early 20th century. I came to Baedeker through my maternal grandfather, who amassed a collection of more than 130 of the red guides. He was possessed by a particularly keen sense of wanderlust, even into his 80s, and bought many hundreds of antique travel books. The tone of the Baedeker guides is informed, detailed, authoritative — and riotously, unguardedly rude. Alongside the city maps, ferry time-tables, and guides to churches, monuments and museums, there are unforgiving comments on the ‘natives’ a traveller might have the misfortune to encounter. The Spanish are indolent, the Greeks filthy, the Italians dishonest and the ‘Orientals’ as stupid as children. The guides reflect an imperial attitude that would be unthinkable today. For a century, Baedeker — founded in 1832 by German publisher Karl Baedeker — was the indispensable guide to Europe, the Middle East and beyond. He prized himself on the accuracy of his books and was once discovered keeping count of how many stairs there were to the roof of Milan cathedral by placing a coin on every 20th step. He wanted his readers to know exactly how far they would have to climb. By the outbreak of World War I, 992 editions of the guides had been published, covering Europe, Russia, North America, India and the Middle East. After Germany, Britain was the biggest consumer of the books. It was the red Baedeker, small enough to fit in an overcoat pocket, which the British took as protection when they ventured abroad. Today, many people know of Baedeker through reading or watching the film adaptation of E.M. Forster’s A Room With A View. In the opening chapters, our heroine Lucy Honeychurch (played in the film by Helena Bonham Carter) finds herself in Florence without a Baedeker. A vintage Baedeker, which is guilty of terrible racial stereotypes . The guide is supposed to be a shield against Italian passion and without its protective influence, Lucy finds herself being kissed by an Englishman made hot-blooded by the Tuscan sun. The name was also made famous by the Baedeker Raids of World War II when the Germans targeted bombing campaigns over English cities such as Bath, Canterbury, and Norwich, singled out for their architectural beauty by Baedeker’s Guide To Great Britain. The aim was to depress morale by destroying our Regency terraces, cathedrals and medieval streets. In return, the RAF razed Leipzig, demolishing the Baedeker HQ. Reading the guides today you are struck by how patrician they are in their view of the world. These are books for travellers from the two great European imperial powers: Britain and Germany. In an age before political correctness, it was possible to be really very rude indeed about foreigners. It is not just the Spanish who are liable to run off with your change. In Italy, according to my grand-father’s 1912 guide, extortion is the national hobby and begging the national plague. Customs officials unfailingly pilfer your luggage and the cab-drivers, boatmen and porters are insolent and rapacious to ‘an almost incredible pitch’. The guide explains that while the ‘evil sanitary reputation of Naples’ is often exaggerated, it remains a filthy city. The southern Italians, Baedeker explains, believe the ‘brilliancy’ of their climate more than makes up for the dirt. Travellers are advised to stay in hotels with iron bedsteads as these are less likely to be infested with the ‘enemies of repose’ — Baedeker’s dainty euphemism for bedbugs. Still, the guide cheerfully concludes, things have improved greatly since the cholera epidemic of 1884, though travellers are advised not to order oysters as they have been known to cause typhus. Greece is worse. The bedclothes at the inns are full of ‘fleas, bedbugs, lice . . . and other disgusting insects, winged and wingless’. You cannot even console yourself with a glass of wine for the Greek vintages are universally ‘insipid and weak’. Tangiers market in Morocco is ‘an indescribable mass of Oriental humanity’; and in Egypt, any traveller who comes into contact with the natives ‘should avoid rubbing their eyes with their hands’. You couldn’t get away with that in a Dorling Kindersley guide today. Indeed, some of Baedeker’s advice will appal modern sensibilities. In Syria, you are advised to ward off stray dogs with an umbrella and in Egypt it is acceptable to hit a cab driver with your walking stick. You are, however, advised to ‘sternly repress’ the urge to prod a donkey with a stick to encourage it to gallop. (The original owner of my grandfather’s 1914 Egypt guide, a C. Crampton from Harrogate, put an emphatic ‘X’ in the margin next to this advice.) Overall, the poor Egyptians are given a hard time of it. The average native, explains Baedeker, is ‘no more intelligent than a child’. Baedeker is not just guilty of terrible racial stereotypes. He also has a very dim view of the capabilities of women. A female traveller is a delicate creature who cannot possibly manage certain activities. When it comes to climbing Mount Vesuvius, for example, a man may do it on foot, but as this is too ‘fatiguing’ for ladies, they are advised to take the train. I can say with great satisfaction that I managed it perfectly well as a 13-year-old schoolgirl. Few countries escape Baedeker’s censure, although the Dutch are grudgingly admired for their cleanliness: ‘Spiders appear to be regarded with special aversion and vermin is fortunately as rare as cobwebs.’ Germany, of course, is beyond reproach. But what of Great Britain? Certainly, we fare better than some countries. ‘As compared with Continental hotels,’ explains the 1927 guide, ‘British hotels may be said as a rule to excel in cleanliness and sanitary arrangements.’ So far so good, though the guide adds that some hotels can be tolerated by gentlemen, but certainly not by ladies. Our cuisine is inferior and monotonous and the national dish, the guide remarks disparagingly, is tea with chips and steak. As for the British themselves, Baedeker observes that the country is ‘a place of parsons, puppy dogs and peculiar people’. After World War II, Baedekers disappeared from British shelves. Other guides such as Dorling Kindersley, the Lonely Planet and Time Out took their place. Then, in 2007, the series was relaunched. The red covers remain, but they now come in wipe-clean, plastic jackets. Practical, but with none of the romance of my grandfather’s red leather hardbacks. In tone they are indistinguishable from other guidebooks. There is nothing to match Baedeker’s sniffy comment on visiting large towns in England: ‘We need hardly caution newcomers against the artifices of pickpockets and wiles of impostors.’ Nor are they as evocative as the originals — for there are passages of lyrical description amid the scorpions and bedbugs. The scenery of Southern Greece, for example, is celebrated for ‘its mountains, its deep-blue gulfs and its clear, ethereal atmosphere which brings distant objects close to the beholder and robs shadows of their depth and gloom’. While I don’t advocate a return to the days when Edwardian guides advised travellers to wash their hands if they so much as touched a foreigner, there is something refreshing about Baedeker’s acerbic comments on the food, hotels and manners of foreign climes. This week, many of us will return from August holidays in France, Spain and Italy rather wishing someone had warned us that the local taxis smell like goat sheds, that the paella will make you desperately ill and that you cannot get a decent cup of Earl Grey anywhere in the Mediterranean.","The guides were founded in 1832 by German publisher Karl Baedeker .

"Iced chocolate treats may be a firm favourite these days, but it seems that the combination is older than many people thought. The earliest English recipe for chocolate 'dessert' has been discovered after being hidden for 350 years. The recipe was written at a time when chocolate was very different from what we are familiar with today. Chocaholic: The dessert is similar to a modern iced chocolate drink, according to Dr Kate Loveman . It was made by shaking a salty . chocolate liquid inside a container surrounded by snow, with the . resulting concoction being similar to chilled drinks sold in coffee shops . today. Dr Kate Loveman, from the University of Leicester, discovered the dessert in a pamphlet of seven recipes for chocolate dishes written in 1668 by Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Sandwich. The Restoration chocoholic was Pepys's patron and the great, great grandfather of John Montagu, 4th Earl, credited with inventing the sandwich. Dr Loveman said: 'I tried out the freezing method using snow - and lived to tell the tale, despite not following Sandwich's advice. 'It was pretty good, it's not creamy like you would expect of an ice-cream, it's like a very solid version of one of the iced coffees you can buy from a high street coffee shop.' Today iced cold drinks and treats are usually enjoyed on hot summer days, rather than in the depths of winter, which was virtually the only time the Earl could have the drinks. Dr Loveman said: 'Freezing food required cutting-edge technology in seventeenth-century England, so these ices were seen as great luxuries. 'There were a few reasons why the Earl would have been collecting the recipes. Delicious: The dessert is not like a modern ice cream and is icy rather than creamy . 'Firstly they just liked it. Secondly, there seems to be a long term interest in bringing chocolate to England commercially. 'Sandwich also sits on a committee looking at how to improve trade with newly colonised areas in South and Central America. 'Lastly, the Earl of Sandwich was a member of the Royal Society and they were interested in freezing and ice, this was at the time when Robert Boyle was doing a lot of work on how to freeze things.' Even if the technology was yet to catch up, chocolate was till a novelty item and only just ticking the nation's taste buds in the 1600s. Dr Loveman explained: 'Chocolate was first advertised in England around 1640 as an exotic drink made from cacao beans. In the 1660s, when the Earl of Sandwich collected his recipes, chocolate often came with advice about safe consumption. The recipe was found in a pamphlet my Sir Edward Montagu, the 2nd Earl of Sandwich . 'One physician cautioned that the ingredients in hot chocolate could cause insomnia, excess mucus, or haemorrhoids. People worried that iced chocolate in particular was 'unwholesome' and could damage the stomach, heart, and lungs. 'There were ways round this, however. Sandwich thought the best way to ward off the dangers of eating frozen chocolate was to 'Drinke Hott chocolatti of an houre after' it. In other words, chocoholics are not new.' The discovery was made during a search of a journal kept by Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Sandwich, by Leicester University historian, Dr Kate Loveman. Altogether seven recipes were found, including one acquired by the Earl from King Charles II for enhancing chocolate with extravagant ingredients including whale vomit, known as ambergris, musk and civet, a substance extracted from the glands of a civet cat. The recipe has a £200 cost written on it - a staggering amount for the time - but it is not known whether this was the price paid for the recipe or the cost of the ingredients. Dr Loveman said: 'Charles II's recipe involved mixing 3lbs of cocoa nuts, oil of Jamaica, oil of aniseed, oil of cinnamon, cardamom and Guinea pepper to make what they call a leaven cake, although it's nothing like what we would consider a leaven cake today. 'Then to make the chocolate he says you should mix more cocoa nuts, vanilla and sugar, which could be perfumed with musk, ambergris and civet. 'It's unclear if Sandwich paid £200 for the recipe itself or just for the ingredients, but to put it in perspective if you are a housemaid in the Earl's house you would make £4 a year.' The thick mixture would usually be watered down before it was drunk, or it may have been mixed in a way similar to the Earl's own recipe. Six of the other recipes recorded by the Earl were drawn from his connections on the continent, where drinking chocolate was pioneered by the Spanish. Changes: The chocolate is very different from the sweet, milky form we eat now . Dr Loveland said: 'Sandwich used a book called A Curious Treatise on the Nature and Quality of Chocolate by a Spanish Doctor called Antonio Colmenero, which had been translated into French, for some of the recipes. 'The others came from one of his subordinates in Spain called John Warden, who sent information from Madrid on frozen chocolate technology, including a recipe for frozen chocolate froth.' Dr Loveland recreated the Earl's own recipe, which resembled a thicker version of the iced coffee drinks available at high street coffee shops today. The Earl's recipe read: 'Prepare the chocolatti [to make a drink]... and Then Putt the vessell that hath the Chocolatti in it, into a Jaraffa [i.e. a carafe] of snow stirred together with some salt, & shaike the snow together sometyme & it will putt the Chocolatti into tender Curdled Ice & soe eate it with spoons.' His journal was written after he found his love for chocolate while ambassador extraordinary to Spain in the 1660s.","Found in 1668 pamphlet by Sir Edward Montagu, the 2nd Earl of Sandwich .

"Dennis Rodman has embarked on another visit to North Korea, meeting dictator Kim Jong Un despite growing reports of a string of state executions in the secretive state. The former basketball star returned to Beijing from a 'diplomacy visit' last night, amid reports that  Kim had ordered the machine-gun execution of his former singer lover, Hyon Song-wol and 12 other entertainers on August 20 for appearing in an 'sex tape' Some of the musicians were also reported to have had Bibles, which are banned in North Korea, when they were detained and all were treated as political dissidents. But there were doubts surrounding the . images of his trip supplied by the North Korean propoganda machine as one featuring a . disembodied hand appeared to be photoshopped. It suggests that the hand of state censors may have been involved in altering the images, and the trip may not be all it seems.Some observers suggested an interpreter had been removed from a shot to make Kim Jong Un look better. Scroll down for video . Whose hand is that? Rodman and Kim Jong Un - and a mysterious (possibly photoshopped?) third hand - in North Korea . Crocs? Really?

"Kevin Pietersen implored England to entertain him on his day out at Lord’s but he had to wait before Gary Ballance gloriously granted his wish by responding to the most testing situation with a maiden Test century of rare class. The sacked star sat in a hospitality box like a modern day Roman emperor in judgment on the new era as Ballance came to England’s rescue on a fourth day of this Investec series that displayed Test cricket in all its glorious unpredictability. For much of the day Pietersen had watched Sri Lanka threaten to pull off an extraordinary first Test victory but he was nowhere to be seen when Ballance swung the spin of Rangana Herath high towards his Grandstand vantage point to reach his hundred with a six off the first ball of the day’s final over. Century: Gary Ballance celebrates his maiden test hundred after bringing it up with a six over mid-wicket . What it means: Ballance punches the sky after he tonked Herath over the mid-wicket boundary . Hoick: The Yorkshire No 3 had no interest in ending the innings in the 90s when he whacked Herath into the deep . Digging in: While his team-mates struggled, Gary Ballance show composure with an important innings . Well handled: England No 3 Ballance used the sweep shot to good effect against spinner Rangana Herath . Muted celebration: Ballance raises his bat to the crowd after his hard-fought half-century on day four at Lord's . Cue another joyous English celebration . to add to that of first innings double centurion Joe Root and a . position of dominance from which England can push for victory on Monday even . though they spent much of Sunday on the back foot. Only . England, it seemed, could have forced anything other than a draw at the . start of the day but from the moment Alastair Cook set a defensive . field for the first over it was Sri Lanka who looked the more positive, . proactive side. Pietersen . had tweeted his hope that England would quickly take the last three Sri . Lankan wickets and then hurry to a 380 lead but, when Sri Lanka claimed . five victims in the middle session, a declaration was the last thing on . Cook’s mind. As it turned . out Pietersen’s demands were almost totally met but it was only when . Ballance and Chris Jordan joined forces that Cook was able again to . think about dictating terms on what could be a fascinating last day. Sunday . was largely Sri Lanka’s day, with captain Angelo Mathews joining Kumar . Sangakkara on the Lord’s honours board on his first Test innings in this . country and then Shaminda Eranga ripping the heart out of England’s top . order. Yet it still ended . with the hosts 389 ahead and surely poised to declare overnight and attack . Sri Lanka on a pitch that finally started to give bowlers minimal . assistance before Ballance shifted the balance emphatically back in his . side’s favour. This was a . big innings for Ballance, even though he is only playing his second . Test, as England have asked a lot by elevating him to the all-important . No 3 position ahead of Ian Bell and Root. He . did little to suggest he would make it his own in the first innings but . now, with real pressure on England, the Yorkshireman displayed a calm . temperament and a strength off the back foot that should serve him well . in Test cricket. How's that? Sri Lanka's Rangana Herath (centre) roars with delight as he dismisses Moeen Ali . Skittled: Opener Sam Robson's off stump cartwheels as England lose quick wickets in their second innings . Centurion: Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews celebrates reaching his century during day four . How England needed him when they plunged to 121 for six . after taking the last three Sri Lankan wickets in 70 minutes to give . themselves a first innings lead of 122 in a first Test where bat had . dominated ball for the first three days. Eranga, . the quickest of this ‘pop-gun’ Sri Lankan attack, had shown the way to . attack on this pitch with a superb spell from the Nursery End that saw . him take three for three in 21 balls and threatened to turn this first . Test on its head. But, after . Rangana Herath had further preyed on home nerves with two wickets of . his own, an English batsman of Southern African extraction showed a man . in the stands who trod a similar path that the middle order is in safe . hands. When Matt Prior was . the sixth Englishman to fall England led by only 243 with a minimum of . 125 overs left in the Test, more than enough time for Sri Lanka to . recover from conceding 575 in the first innings to go 1-0 up in this . two-Test series. Bizarre: Day four was most memorable for Nuwan Pradeep's bizarre dismissal for Sri Lanka . Pace: England's Chris Jordan bowled a short ball to Pradeep and it caught him off balance . Smash: Pradeep ended up dismissing himself by crashing into his own stumps, sending them sprawling . Out: England's Sam Robson walks back to the pavilion after his dismissal for 19 runs at Lord's . But two . of the men England hope will lead the post-Pietersen era then took over, . with Ballance initially playing second fiddle to Jordan in their . fortune changing stand of 78 but then adding another 57 with Stuart . Broad in the dominant manner he has shown in becoming such a force in . domestic cricket. Only . when he was on 36 did Ballance have an anxious moment after Sri Lanka . reviewed Paul Reiffel’s not out decision to a caught behind appeal. Mahela Jayawardene, in particular, was furious when technology agreed . with the on-field umpire but there was no sign of a HotSpot nor movement . on Snicko. Ballance, whose . parents and brother flew over from Zimbabwe for this match, raced to his . hundred before the close to save Cook an awkward choice on whether to . bat on today and now England will hope their bowlers have enough time, . with 17 overs in the match already lost to shoddy over-rates, to press . home their advantage. ‘It . was a great feeling, I can’t really describe it,’ said Ballance on going . to his hundred with a six. ‘With an over to go I didn’t want to muddle . around with singles. Luckily I got a slog sweep out of the middle.’ It was a moment and method that Pietersen would surely have approved of. He's back: Kevin Pietersen enjoys a beer while watching the Test, his first return since being sacked . Laugh: Pietersen (front right) enjoys a joke with his friend, TV presenter Piers Morgan (front left) Struggle: England's Moeen Ali is bowled as England struggle during their second innings . Contemplation: England head coach Peter Moores is deep in thought as England struggle with the bat . Shot: England's Joe Root plays a stroke on day four but runs were hard to come by for England . Jump for joy: Chris Jordan leaps in celebration after taking the wicket of Nuwan Kulasekara . Gone: The England team rush to congratulate Jordan at Lord's after Kulasekara's wicket .

"The Robertson family are excited to continue filming Duck Dynasty after it was announced yesterday that network A&E would be lifting the ban placed on patriarch Phil Robertson less than two weeks ago over homophobic comments he made in a GQ article. In a statement to FoxNews.com, the family said they are 'excited to keep making a quality TV show for our dedicated fans, who have showed us wonderful support. We will continue to represent our faith and values in a positive way through ""Duck Dynasty"" and our many projects that we are currently working on.' 'The outpouring of support and prayers has encouraged and emboldened us greatly,' the family added. The Robertson clan are worth an estimated $15 million based of the back of the Duck Commander that Phil launched back in the 1970's . The network said in a statement yesterday that they planned to reinstate Phil on the reality show after discussions with the Robertson family and consultations with 'numerous advocacy groups'. Robertson was put on indefinite hiatus less than two weeks ago by A&E in response to the uproar following the interview. But despite consulting advocacy groups, many spoke out against Phil's reinstatement - the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Discrimination (GLAAD) issuing a statement yesterday to Fox News saying it the network is just greedy to capitalize off the hit show. 'Phil Robertson should look African American and gay people in the eyes and hear about the hurtful impact of praising Jim Crow laws and comparing gay people to terrorists. If dialogue with Phil is not part of next steps then A+E has chosen profits over African American and gay people – especially its employees and viewers,' the said. The fourth season is set to premiere this . January, and was largely completed before Phil made the statements, . meaning he didn't miss a single episode of filming during the ban. The removal of the 67-year-old patriarch from the show was lauded by gay rights organizations, but fans of the show denounced it as a violation of Robertson's right to free speech. Conservative supporters include Sarah Palin, who wrote in a Facebook post: 'Free speech is an endangered species. Those intolerants’ hatin’ and taking on the Duck Dynasty patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us.' A&E initially took action after Robertson's comments caused uproar, saying his views were 'disappointing' and that A&E has always been 'strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community.' Now, the network says the family has made it clear that they are sorry if they caused any offense with the patriarch's remarks. 'While Phil’s comments made in the interview reflect his personal views based on his own beliefs, and his own personal journey, he and his family have publicly stated they regret the “coarse language” he used and the mis-interpretation of his core beliefs based only on the article. He also made it clear he would “never incite or encourage hate.” We at A+E Networks expressed our disappointment with his statements in the article, and reiterate that they are not views we hold,' reads the statement. Reinstated: Phil Robertson won't miss a day of filming after his brief hiatus was reversed by A&E . The homophobic comments from the born-again Christian included such insights as, ' 'It seems like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man’s anus. 'That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.' He also grouped homosexuals in with terrorists, saying, 'We never, ever judge someone on who’s going to heaven, hell. That’s the Almighty’s job. We just love 'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether they’re homosexuals, drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, you see what I’m saying?' GLAAD hit back soon after the interview was released online, calling him a ‘stain’ on the network A&E which airs the show. GLAAD spokesperson Wilson Cruz told E! News: 'Phil and his family claim to be Christian, but Phil's lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true Christians believe. 'He clearly knows nothing about gay people or the majority of Louisianans - and Americans - who support legal recognition for loving and committed gay and lesbian couples. Disgusted: Reverent Jesse Jackson said Robertson's comments make him worse than the bus driver who infamously sent Rosa Parks to the back of the bus . 'Phil's decision to push vile and extreme stereotypes is a stain on A&E and his sponsors who now need to reexamine their ties to someone with such public disdain for LGBT people and families.' In addition to his anti-gay rhetoric, the duck hunter also made dubious remarks regarding Louisiana before the Civil Rights Movement. 'I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash. We're going across the field,' said Robertson. 'They're singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, 'I tell you what: These doggone white people'—not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.' For many, including Reverend Jesse Jackson, who compared Robertson to the driver who sent Rosa Parks to the back of the bus the attempts at damage control by A$E were insufficient. 'These statements uttered by Robertson are more offensive than the bus driver in Montgomery, Alabama, more than 59 years ago,’ Jackson said in a statement obtained by ABC News. ‘At least the bus driver, who ordered Rosa Parks to surrender her seat to a white person, was following state law. 'Robertson’s statements were uttered freely and openly without cover of the law, within a context of what he seemed to believe was “white privilege.”’ In his statement, the 72-year-old civil rights leader demanded to meet within 72 hours with A&E executives and Cracker Barrel’s CEO to discuss the future of Duck Dynasty memorabilia, which rakes in millions of dollars for the network and its star family. Jackson also urged the network to uphold Robertson’s indefinite suspension from the popular program. Stardom: Two of the unlikely reality TV stars of Duck Dynasty, brothers Silas 'Uncle Si' Robertson (left) and Phil Robertson . Robertson's many fans and supporters countered with an online petition, called I Stand with Phil, demanding A&E reinstate Robertson to the show. 'Mr. Robertson’s comments in GQ Magazine are simply reflective of a Biblical view of sexuality, marriage, and family – a view that has stood the test of time for thousands of years and continues to be held by the majority of Americans and today’s world as a whole,' reads the petition, launched by a conservative Christian organization. In addition to the petition, conservative Christians rallied behind Robertson by flooding the A&E New York offices with thousands of rubber duckies as part of the Mail The Duck campaign to reinstate the reality star to his show. Another show of support came in the form of a planned mass eat-in at chicken restaurant Chick-Fil-A. CEO of the fast food restaurant Dan Cathy faced his own scandal after making anti-gay comments. According to Fox News, supporters are planning a 'Chick-Phil-A' day, in which they don camouflage gear and gorge on poultry. The odd show of support is planned for January 21, according to a Facebook page dedicated to the event. Robertson supporters are encouraged to wear 'Duck Commander or camouflage gear' to their local Chick-Fil-A restaurant to 'stand for free speech' and 'sit for good food.' Fast food and freedom: The Facebook page for a planned 'Chick-Phil-A Day' in support of Phil Robertson . It so far has more than 25,000 'likes' and many have expressed their desire to go. 'IM [sic] with Phil. He is right in what he said and how he believes. I will be eating ckicken [sic] to show support for free speech,' wrote one. Another questioned the sudden fervency of the Christian right's support of free speech. 'How many of you ""free speech advocates"" stood up for the Dixie Chicks . when people wanted to kick them off the radio for using their ""free . speech""?' It's unclear what effect the mass consumption of fried chicken was intended to have on Robertson's suspension.The controversy did no damage to the Robertson coffers, either. Sales for the Duck Dynasty Christmas album soared during the holiday season.According to Nielsen, Duck The Halls: A Robertson Family Christmas sold 132,000 during the week of December 22, nearly twice the amount of discs sold since its first week on the shelves in October.Sales were high enough to claim the number four spot on the Billboard album charts.The definite end of the Duck Commander's 'indefinite' hiatus has been greeted without surprise by media pundits.Founder of Business Insider Henry Blodget tweeted, 'That Phil Robertson ""suspension"" was the most brilliant marketing stunt ever. Two weeks ago, I had never even heard of Duck Dynasty!'Funny or Die host Billy Eichner tweeted, 'Very excited A&E is resuming Duck Dynasty with Phil Robertson. We need more ignorant homophobic racists who probably hate women on the air.'The reality show - which follows the Robertson clan running their duck-calling business in the swampland of West Monroe, Louisiana - has been a runaway success for A&E, with a Christmas special recently pulling in 9 million viewers.The millionaire self-described hillbilly's suspension made no impact on the upcoming season of the show and he has missed no filming time.","A&E has announced Phil Robertson will return to Duck Dynasty .

"A former Manhattan career girl has described her experience of giving up revealing clothes and make-up for a year - as well as completely covering her head, legs and arms - as 'liberating' and 'frightening'. Lauren Shields was working as a receptionist on Fifth Avenue when she started to become interested in Quaker, Jewish and Muslim belief systems. 'Every morning I would shoehorn . myself onto the train with an army of ladies sporting fitted waistlines, toned . arms, blown-out hair, full faces of make-up and heels,' she writes on Salon.com. 'I hated every second of it.' Before and after: Shields during the experiment (left) and afterward with her Shields with her $2000 pink-highlighted hair extensions (right) She contrasted this with the headscarves and long skirts worn by Hasidic women in her Williamsburg, Brooklyn neighborhood. 'These women were not . “fashionable” first, like most of the women I saw everywhere else — they . seemed to be focused on something else, something more important than . what was trendy,' she observed. Where it all began: The idea for her modesty experiment began when she worked in New York City as a receptionist but she hated every second of it and felt like she was dressing up every day for nothing . Because she didn't practice those religions, Shields felt that she had no 'excuse' to dress in a similar fashion. But two years later as a . student at Candler Theological Seminary in Georgia, a woman spoke to her class about her experience in the Middle East . wearing a hijab. Covering up: Spiers says men take women who look like Kim Kardashian less seriously . Her epiphany afterwards? 'In America, Islamic dress is often a choice, and the women who make this choice are declining to endorse Western Imperialism and the sexualization of their bodies'. 'It's a way of expressing modesty and resisting the pressure to be scrutinized against Western standards of beauty.' So, with the support of her seminary community and then-boyfriend, she designed the Modesty Experiment. In order to help loosen her 'death grip on the idea that youth and beauty were prerequisites to relevance', Shields started a blog and Facebook page. For nine months she covered all of her hair, wore nothing fitted, and only exposed her knees and shoulders at home. She also shunned makeup or nail polish, except on 'rare exceptions'. At first Shields felt more 'invisible' - to both men and women - and missed her products. 'I had been telling myself I was beyond superficiality when in fact I had bought the whole thing hook, line and sinker,' she says. But there were also good points: She . found that she got a lot more done when she was no longer obsessed with shoes. She saved money. And she says she finally met 'men who . believe that the more ''rich' and made-up like Kim Kardashian a woman . looks, the less inclined they are to take her seriously as a co-worker . or dating prospect'. Concealed: For nine months she covered all of her hair, wore nothing fitted, and only exposed her knees and shoulders at home . Like-minded: She finally met 'men who believe that the more rich and made-up like Kim Kardashian a woman looks, the less inclined they are to take her seriously as a co-worker or dating prospect' One of them became her boyfriend, and the couple is now engaged.Her project has caused controversy. Many commenters accuse her of judging women who wear make-up in the same way she was judged. Writer Katie Baker of Jezebel.com commented that, with her tapered eyebrows and nose ring,'she was putting just as much time and energy into her appearance as the vain women she pities.' The site called Spiers's project 'superficial and silly' and called her out for lengthy blog posts that complain about how hard the project was that only became more positive after she got a date. Controversial: Her project has caused controversy with many commenters accuse her of judging women who wear make-up in the same way she was judged . Letting go: Shields says that she was able to get a lot more done once she got rid of her shoe obsession (left) but admits she cried when she gave away her clothes (right) 'Judging by her blog, she didn't feel all that fabulous about it, except . when her antiquated, mishmashed concept of perfectly modest femininity . was validated by a man. How radical.' Spiers insists that looking good isn’t necessarily a bad . thing, but 'when it becomes the cornerstone of your identity then you’re . doing nothing but damage to yourself,' she writes.

"A $10million reward may soon be offered by the American government as a way to get tips on the recent highly-publicized deaths of James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Agence France Presse reported on the development, saying the hefty sum was 'unanimously approved [in] a bill' by the Senate on Friday. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said 'One way we can honor the memories of James Foley and Steven Sotloff is to bring their evil murderers to justice, which this measure will help do,' according to the news service. AFP reported that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) said 'Our country lost two of its own, and we must do everything possible to bring the terrorists who committed these atrocities to justice.' The news service pointed out that the bill has yet to be approved by the House of Representatives. The developments took place on the same day President Barack Obama signed into law legislation authorizing the military to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels fighting Islamic State militants in the Middle East.

Congress will revisit the issue after the midterm elections. Thursday's bipartisan 78-22 tally Thursday blended support from Obama's close Democratic allies and some of his fiercest GOP critics, including top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. It put leading contenders for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination on opposite sides. Some of Obama's liberal allies defected. The legislation also provides funding for the government after the end of the budget year on Sept. 30, eliminating any threat of a shutdown in the run-up to November elections that will seat a new House and decide control of the Senate. The House approved the bill on Wednesday. Obama said Thursday that the support from both Republicans and Democrats 'shows the world that Americans are united' in combating the Islamic State group. He said the militants thought they could frighten or intimidate Americans, but the Senate vote had showed them they were wrong. 'As Americans, we do not give in to fear,' Obama said. 'We pull together. We stand together.' U.S. troops would train Syrian rebels at camps in Saudi Arabia, though the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, said it could take a year before they would return to the battlefield in Syria. The arm-and-train authority only extends into December, and lawmakers are to revisit the issue in a postelection, lame-duck session. The developments took place on the same day President Barack Obama signed into law legislation authorizing the military to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels fighting Islamic State militants in the Middle East. Thursday's bipartisan 78-22 tally Thursday blended support from Obama's close Democratic allies and some of his fiercest GOP critics. ISIS militants are allegedly seen in this file photograph . Supporters of the proposal agreed that more has to be done to combat Islamic State extremists who are on the move in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. estimates the extremists can muster 20,000 to 31,500 fighters across Syria and Iraq, with two-thirds of them in Syria and the rest in Iraq. Terrorism experts say they are better organized and more dangerous than al-Qaida, which is lending urgency to the effort. But opponents of Obama's strategy say it would hand weapons to shadowy groups that could prove untrustworthy and whose top priority is to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad. 'Intervention when both choices are bad is a mistake. Intervention when both sides are evil is a mistake. Intervention that destabilizes the Middle East is a mistake,' said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is considering a run for the White House in 2016. 'And yet, here we are again, wading into a civil war.' Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who's also weighing a presidential run, joined Paul in opposition, while Sen. Rubio, also a potential candidate, supported the president's request. 'We will confront ISIL one way or the other, and I believe the sooner the better,' Rubio said, using an alternate acronym for the group. 'What we are asked to do now is approve funding to arm moderate rebel elements in Syria. There is no guarantee of success. There is none. But there is a guarantee of failure if we do not even try.' Liberal opponents included rising Democratic star Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. 'Not only are countries in the region not stepping up in the fight ... but believe it or not several of these Gulf states are empowering' Islamic State forces as well as al-Qaida allied groups with financial contributions, Sanders said. Some strong opponents of the war in Iraq swung behind the president, alarmed by the Islamic State threat. 'I am so cautious when it comes to voting to go to war,' said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. 'In this case, if I were to sit back and say I'm too afraid, I'm too nervous, that is exactly the wrong signal to send.' More hawkish lawmakers said Obama's strategy won't be enough to blunt the advance of Islamic State forces. Obama has ordered U.S. airstrikes as well but is adamant that he won't send combat troops to battle the Islamic extremists. Top administration officials again fanned out across Capitol Hill on Thursday to sell the president's strategy, with Secretary of State John Kerry pushing back on an argument by some that Syria's rebels lack moderates, or at least any with the capacity to make a difference in the war. He told the House Foreign Affairs Committee about several opposition groups, each comprising up to 4,000 fighters, which have battled Islamic State militants and other extremists over the past year. Kerry said the coalition that will fight the Islamic State group counts 50 countries. He said countries in Europe, the Arab world and elsewhere had committed to taking part militarily, without specifying any by name. Some senators opposed arming the Syrian rebels but voted for the measure anyway to avoid a government shutdown. Others, including Rubio, supported it despite opposing the underlying spending measure.","A $10million reward may soon be offered by the American government as a way to get tips on those responsible on the recent highly-publicized deaths of James Foley and Steven Sotloff .

"Pope Francis is the most influential Twitter user – or ‘tweep’ - in the world, a new study has revealed. Although the Argentine Jesuit Pontiff is the second most followed world leader after Barack Obama, he massively outstrips the US President in the frequency with which his followers retweet his messages. This makes him the most influential ‘tweep’ on the planet according to Twiplomacy 2014, a study of how Twitters is being used by world leaders. His Holiness Pope Francis is the most influential tweeter in the world according to Twiplomacy 2014, a study of how Twitters is being used by world leaders . More than 14 million people follow the Pope at @Pontifex in nine languages and each tweet made by the Pontiff is on average retweeted nearly 17,000 times, Twiplomacy revealed in a final report. Although President Obama has 43.7 million followers of his @BarackObama account, his tweets are only retweeted an average of 1,400 times, meaning that the Holy Father’s tweets are retweeted more than 10 times as often. Of the two, the Pope enjoys greater global reach because of the support of his followers for his tweets, which most commonly include the words ‘God’, ‘Jesus’ and ‘love’. US President Barack Obama (left) is rated the second most influential world leader on Twitter (right) ‘By this standard, Pope Francis @Pontifex is by far the most influential tweep with more than 10,000 retweets for every tweet he sends on his Spanish account and 6,462 retweets on average on his English account,’ the report said. ‘Venezuela’s President @NicolasMadurois in second position, receiving on average 2,065 retweets per tweet on his Spanish account.’ The report revealed that President Obama’s Twitter high point came the day after his re-election in 2009 when he tweeted a picture of himself with the slogan ‘four more years’. It became one of the four most popular tweets ever, retweeted 806,066 times. ‘However since then, the engagement on the account has been in decline,’ the report said. ‘Despite the account’s massive following, the @BarackObama tweets are on average only retweeted 1,442 times.’ After President Obama and Pope Francis, the third most followed world leader is Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono who has five million followers. Prime Minister David Cameron (@Number10gov) is in 13th place with 2.6 million followers while the Queen (@BritishMonarchy) is in 36th place with 671,000 followers. The Pope’s Twitter account was opened by his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, and is unique because his tweets are published in Spanish, English, French, German, Arabic, Portuguese, Polish and Latin. ‘The five most followed world leaders have one thing in common - they have discovered Twitter as a powerful one-way broadcasting tool,’ the Twiplomacy report said.It also noted the emergence of the phenomenon of ‘hashtag diplomacy’ whereby world leaders and diplomats are increasingly contacting each other through their Twitter accounts. The report also revealed that eight world leaders have seen some of their tweet retweeted more than 24,000 times. They include the announcement of the May election victory of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister of India, the abdication of the King of Spain, and the admission that Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 ‘ended in the southern Indian Ocean’.","Pope has fewer followers on social network than Obama but his followers retweet him more often .

"A grandfather who murdered his ex-wife and hid her body inside her bed where it lay undiscovered for three weeks has been jailed for life. Daniel Spencer, 59, will have to serve at least 16 years behind bars after he beat and strangled his former spouse Jane Wiggett, 57, at her home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, on July 24 last year. He then placed the petite grandmother’s body inside her bed, with pillows and blankets tucked around her, before telling friends and family she had gone on holiday. Daniel Spencer, 59, (right) beat and strangled his former spouse Jane Wiggett, 57, (left) at her home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, on July 24 last year . Concerns began to grow when Ms Wiggett failed to turn up for appointments and a search party gained entry to her home two days later. They looked round the property but did not spot the body because Spencer had hidden it so well beneath the 'carefully' made bed. Spencer, from Cheltenham, told Ms Wiggett’s relatives that she was on holiday in Penzance, Cornwall and in contact with him by phone. However, as weeks went on, people began to grow suspicios of Spencer and Ms Wiggett was reported missing to police on August 15. Officers finally found her body the following morning. CCTV issued by Gloucestershire Police of Jane Wiggett and her ex-husband, Daniel Spencer, walking into Primark in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the day before her murder . Grandfather Spencer, who denied a charge of murdering Ms Wiggett, attempted to flee the country but was arrested in a hotel by Birmingham Airport. He denied having any part in Ms Wiggett’s death during a 12 day trial at Bristol Crown Court but a unanimous jury convicted him of murder following three hours of deliberations. Spencer remained emotionless as the verdict was returned. Prosecuting, Richard Smith QC, previously told the jury Spencer was a 'jealous' and violent man, who repeatedly lied to cover up what he had done. 'On Wednesday July 24 last year, this defendant visited his then ex-wife in her flat in Cheltenham,' Mr Smith said. 'Something happened to anger him and upset him. CCTV  issued by Gloucestershire Police of Daniel Spencer driving Ms Wiggett's car, which he later sold to raise funds for fleeing the country after her murder . 'There was something of a struggle. Jane Wiggett resisted, it seems, his attack upon her. But the defendant took her by the throat and this time it culminated in him taking her life. 'He put and left Jane’s body lying in her own bed, positioned on her back. Her face was covered with a pillow, her quilt was then carefully put over her as if to hide the fact that she was dead inside.' Spencer and Ms Wiggett were married for 30 years, during which she twice reported him to the police for grabbing her by the throat, before their divorce in 2005. Ms Wiggett, who weighed just seven-and-a-half stone, was last seen on the evening of July 24, after which her phones and credit cards were not used. Spencer also immediately ceased all phone contact with his ex-wife after that date but told relatives and police she had gone to Cornwall for a break. CCTV shows Daniel Spencer in a hotel by Birmingham Airport. It is believed he was staying at the hotel before attempting to flee the country . Friends and family decided to visit Ms Wiggett on July 26 and gained access to her flat. 'They didn’t notice Jane’s body lying under the quilt and blanket, covered over with pillows, in her bed,' Mr Smith told the jury. Police were called at 7.48pm on August 15 and attended her home at 3am the following morning. An officer pulled back the duvet of the bed and spotted Ms Wiggett’s foot. A post-mortem examination found Ms Wiggett had been hit before her death, which was caused by strangulation. Traces of Spencer’s blood were discovered under her fingernails. Daniel Spencer beat and strangled his former spouse Jane Wiggett at her home in Mendip Road, Cheltenham . Police contacted Spencer, who promised to hand himself in but actually fled up north before staying at a hotel in Birmingham airport under a false name. A member of staff at the hotel recognised Spencer from a police appeal published in the national papers and called officers, who arrested him on August 19. Representing Spencer, Andrew Langdon QC said his client suffered from diabetes and poor blood pressure control. 'Given his health he perhaps takes the view that the prospect, given this verdict, of him ever enjoying any liberty in the future is remote,' Mr Langdon said. Members of Ms Wiggett’s family gasped and sobbed loudly as the verdict was returned. Members of Ms Wiggett's family sobbed loudly as the verdict was returned at Bristol Crown Court . The conversation took place on August 15 last year. Police: Hello, not to alarm you, my name’s Lisa, I’m calling from Gloucester Police. I’ve just had a call from a Lin Wiggett, she’s really concerned for her sister-in-law, Jane. She said that you may’ve been in contact with her? Daniel: Urm, she’s supposed to be phoning me tonight at about 10 o’clock.Police: She’s going to speak to the family tonight at around 10? Daniel: No, she’s going to phone me at 10 o’clock tonight.Police: Oh, she’s going to phone you at 10 o’clock. Where is she? Daniel: In Penzance.Police: She’s in Penzance. And why is it that she’s not speaking to everybody else? Daniel: Urm, I don’t really know.Police: You don’t really know. OK so, have you got a telephone number for her? Daniel: No she’s going to phone me.Police: She’s going to phone you. Because obviously, because she’s going to be, she’s been reported as a missing person to us. Which means we need to see her in person to make sure she’s OK and everything else. Daniel: OK well if you give me a contact number, then obviously when she phones me, I’ll get her to phone you. How’s that? Police: That’ll be wonderful. It’s going to be 101.Daniel: Right, OK. Police: OK, she needs to listen to the options, and listen out for Gloucestershire Police. If that’s not a surrounding force for her, then she needs to wait to the end to speak to the operator, and then tell the operator ‘I want to be put through to Gloucester.’ OK? And her incident number with the police is going to be Incident 457 today. Daniel: 457, OK that’s fine.Police: OK? Daniel: OK then, thank you. Police: That’s fantastic thanks very much Robert.. uh Daniel, sorry, that’s your middle name isn’t it? I do apologise. Thank you ever so much for your help Mr Spencer. Daniel: OK, thank you.

"Rape: Attacker Mohammed Azim was jailed for a minimum of 16 years at Stafford Crown Court on Friday . The victim of a rape was forced her to watch harrowing CCTV footage of the attack in front of a jury. The woman was made to relive her terrifying ordeal at the hands of Mohammed Azim, 31,at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Footage showed the moment Azim smashed her over the head with a bottle at a bus stop in in Oldbury, West Midlands, before dragging her into a nearby factory by her hair. She was then subjected to a 25-minute rape ordeal, which was all captured on the firm's CCTV security cameras. Azim, who was drunk and high on cocaine at the time of the attack in November last year, denied three charges of oral rape. His not guilty plea meant his victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was forced to watch back the video in court during Azim's trial so  she could be properly cross-examined. Azim was found guilty of all charges on May 28 and was jailed for a minimum of 16 years at Stafford Crown Court on Friday. After the case outraged anti-rape charities condemned the 'appalling' decision by legal teams to put the victim through the torture of viewing the footage. Yvonne Traynor, Chief Executive of Rape Crisis, said: 'The Criminal Justice system have vowed to consider the feelings of victims of this heinous crime but this lack of consideration shows a contempt for the guideline and utter contempt for the feelings of the survivor. 'The judge had an opportunity to decide what to do and blatantly made the wrong decision. 'I am appalled this woman had been through enough and then to be shown this in court to torture her again shows an appalling lack of consideration and common sense.' Judge Michael Challinor branded Azim a danger to the public and ruled he should only be released one a parole board consider it safe. Shocking: The woman was made to relive her terrifying ordeal at the hands of Mohammed Azim, 31,at Wolverhampton Crown Court . He also extended Azim's period of licence by four years, making the total sentence for the rape offences 20 years. Sentencing him, Judge Challinor said: 'You saw an opportunity to attack this vulnerable and defenceless woman. There was significant planning involved. 'Having engaged her in conversation, pretending to offer her help, you hit her on the head with a bottle. 'You could be seen on CCTV dragging her by her hair to nearby factory premises. 'It was a sustained sexual attack, you threatened to kill her - it's quite clear she thought her life was in danger - a horrific and shocking set of offences. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said victims of rape and other horrific crimes would be spared the ordeal of brutal cross-examination in open court . 'When you had finished with her, you left her traumatised and frightened. In spite of clear evidence at trial, you continued to maintain your innocence. 'You are lucky to have escaped a mandatory life sentence.' The court heard Azim, from Oldbury, had previous convictions for manslaughter and kidnap involving the death of a man in a canal. Defending Amanda O'Mara said: 'These actions that night were complicated or motivated by that cocktail of alcohol and drugs. 'Something must have triggered his behaviour.' In June this year, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced victims of rape and other horrific crimes would be spared the ordeal of brutal cross-examination in open court by giving their evidence before the trial. The plans mean victims will be allowed to record their testimony on video in advance of the case going to court. A series of pilots will see vulnerable victims given the chance to give evidence out of court with the footage played to the jury. The announcement pleased victims' groups who have warned that children have been 'thrown to the wolves' in court. In one recent case a rape victim who was abused by a sex grooming gang from the age of 13 endured 12 days of questioning in a 'forensic examination'. Another vulnerable victim in the same case had to read out line by line from a police statement she gave detailing alleged sexual abuse by her stepfather. But critics say the move could raise concerns among lawyers over whether defendants are getting a fair trial and whether the evidence used against them is properly scrutinised.","The woman was made to relive her ordeal at the hands of Mohammed Azim .

"The average house price in England will reach almost £1million within two decades unless urgent action is taking to tackle the country’s property market, an alarming report warns today. If prices continue to rise on current trends, by 2034 the average home will cost £900,000, according to charity Shelter. It means more than half of all 20 to 34-year-olds could be living with their parents by 2040 after being ‘priced out’ of the market. Reserach by Shelter and KPMG shows how average house prices in England will hit £902,763 by 2034 on current trends . The research, compiled by Shelter and KPMG, found that property prices could quadruple from the current level of around £220,000 if more is not done to tackle the housing shortage. If property prices continue to rise as they have over the last 17 years, the cost of an average home in England will be £446,000 in 2024, ballooning to £903,000 ten years later, the research predicts. At present, the average home in England costs around £225,000. The report also warned that rocketing prices would prevent children flying the nest, as by 2040 half of those aged 20-34 will still be living with their parents. Marianne Fallon, UK head of corporate affairs at KPMG, said England’s housing market is ‘a big and messy problem’. She said: ‘For many people, particularly those in their twenties, the aspiration of owning their own ‘castle’ is fast becoming a fairy tale.’ Falling rates of house building since 1946 has seen a sharp rise in house prices . Home ownership among the under-35s has fallen markedly in the last two decades . The number of 20-34-year-olds has risen dramatically as more young people are priced out of buying a home . Companies’ ability to ‘attract and retain talent’ is also affected, according to KPMG, as young people are put off living and working in London by the astronomical cost of buying a property. A senior official at the Bank of England last night also voiced concerns about rising property prices. Chief economist Spencer Dale said: ‘We know we should be nervous about what’s going on in the housing market.’ The Shelter report, titled Building The Homes We Need, maps out a programme for the next parliament that it says would help the next government turn the tide on the housing shortage by raising house building levels to 250,000 a year by 2021, which would meet the growth in demand. Among the suggestions to fix what Shelter describes as a ‘broken’ market is the creation of a new ‘national housing investment bank’, which would provide low cost, long term loans for housing providers, as part of a programme of new ways to finance affordable house building. It said the bank could also offer special savings accounts, such as ‘housing Isas’ to raise finance from retail deposits. The rate of private sector housebuilding has tumbled since the 2007 financial crash . The report also warns that homes in the UK are much smaller than those seen in countries around the world . Experts have pointed to an imbalance between the supply of homes for sale and demand from would-be buyers as putting an upward pressure on house prices as the housing market recovery gathers pace. Despite Government support schemes, the housing market is ‘increasingly skewed’ towards people who are reliant on getting cash help from their parents, the report said, with only around one third of first-time buyers in 2011 managing to get on the property ladder without needing any extra financial help. The research estimates that more than half of all 20 to 34-year-olds could be living with their parents by 2040 due to being ‘priced out’ of the housing market unless there is radical change. The report said: ‘If nothing is done to increase the supply of homes, house prices will almost certainly continue to rise faster than wages, pricing yet more people out of home ownership.’ The report also suggests empowering local authorities to create ‘new home zones’, which could generate over 8,000 extra homes a year. Shelter and KPMG warn that high land prices are the root of high - and rising - house prices . This idea would involve a local authority selling a plot of land off for a cheaper price to a developer who in return will build affordable homes, rather than the land going to a developer who might pay more for the land but wants to use it to build homes at the top end of the market. The report also suggested that developments could be speeded up by charging council tax on homes that should have been built after a reasonable period for their construction has passed. More garden cities should also be built in ‘high demand’ areas, the report said. It said the next government should consult on and propose sites for up to five new garden cities comprising around 30,000 homes. The report said more should be done to help smaller builders get back into the market by using government guarantees to improve access to their finance. Campbell Robb, Shelter's chief executive, said: ‘Our chronic shortage of affordable homes means that a generation face a future of living in their childhood bedrooms into their thirties. But this report proves that the next government can turn the tide on the housing shortage within a single parliament. ‘The thousands of young people and families forced to watch their dream of stable home slip further out of reach are already paying the price for successive governments' failure to build the homes we need. With housing now a top issue for voters, politicians of all parties are rightly beginning to feel the need to act.’","If house prices continue to rise on current trend will hit £900,000 by 2034 .

"Former Vice President Dick Cheney laid into President Barack Obama and his administration today for failing to recognize sooner the perils of allowing the Islamic State to thrive in Iraq and Syria. 'A realistic strategy has to recognize that ISIS is a grave strategic threat to the United States,' Cheney said during a speech on national security in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday morning. The current situation is 'dire,' he said, and it 'one of the most dangerous we have faced certainly in my lifetime, and far more dangerous than the administration has been willing to admit.' Scroll down for video . Former Vice President Dick Cheney described ISIS as a 'grave strategic threat' and said President Barack Obama and his administration need to wake up to that fact . Cheney said that 'Al Qaeda is not diminished, nor is the tide of war receding' and 'wishing does not make it so.' 'Our president must understand that we are at war and we must do what it takes for as long as it takes to win,' the former Bush administration official said. During his remarks at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute Cheney referred to the Islamic extremists as 'terrorists' and said that defeating them would 'require immediate, sustained simultaneous action across multiple fronts.' 'We must move globally to get back on offense in the War on Terror,' he said. 'This means first recognizing and admitting the size and scope of the threat we face.' Cheney said the U.S. must provide more substantially more military trainers, special operations forces, intelligence and air power to Iraqi and Kurdish forces, and the military must immediately strike ISIS command centers, staging areas and lines of communication, regardless of where they are. 'ISIS does recognize a border between Syria and Iraq, so neither should we,' Cheney said. Previewing Obama's address to the nation tonight, Cheney said that 'we can hope for and we should look for signs of a bold and immediate strategy to defeat ISIS,' but that would be a 'departure' from Obama's past actions. 'So often Obama responds to crises by saying what he will not do,' Cheney said. 'We can only hope that pattern will end tonight.' Instead of throwing around threats like his 'meaningless red line' in Syria, the president needs to make clear to trouble makers that misbehavior will be met with military action, Cheney said. Foes of America in Syria and Iran 'are not impressed' with Obama's tough talk, he said, and they're ignoring his warnings. The president's claims that Russia's recent behavior belongs to 19th century is also laughable, Cheney said. 'They play a rough game over there, and they don't much care to which century we ascribe their conduct,' Cheney cautioned. In Russia, he said, the only concern is, Can we get away with it? If so, end of of discussion. The former vice president said foreign friends often wonder why Obama is 'withdrawing American leadership just when it was needed most' in the world. Obama needs to accept that America as the leader of the free world for the sake of it's allies who 'know that their security relies on American power, Cheney said. The former congressman, and later vice president, moved back to his native state of Wyoming after leaving office but regularly travels to Washington to speak at events. President Obama, seen through an Oval Office window, speaks on the phone with King Abdallah Abd al Aziz of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at the White House. Obama  is preparing to deliver a speech on the Islamic State to the nation this evening . Yesterday, he returned to his old stopping grounds on Capitol Hill to impart his wisdom on congressional Republicans. A Washington Post article described the atmosphere as 'warm,' and the Post said Cheney received a 'rapturous reception.' It noted that two libertarian members of the Republican caucus didn't appear to be as taken with Cheney as their colleagues, though. Reps. Thomas Massie and Justin Amash indicated to the Post that they were none too thrilled with Cheney's calls for aggressive military action to combat terrorist threats. 'His worldview is that we should be in countries around the world and have armed forces everywhere -- and most Republicans don’t agree with that,' Amash said. Libertarians are known for their more dovish stance on military intervention while Cheney, who was an architect of the Iraq war and Bush's War on Terror, takes an extremely hawkish approach. Cheney responded to Amash's critique on Wednesday, saying that those who believe the U.S. should put itself on an isolationist course are 'dead wrong.' While a few Republican members disagreed with his perspective on foreign policy, the meet-up was otherwise a success, Cheney said. 'It was a great reception. I was impressed.' 'They never treated me that way when I was vice president,' he teased, eliciting laughter from the audience.","Cheney outlined the importance of combating ISIS during a speech on national security in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday morning .
'A realistic strategy has to recognize that ISIS is a grave strategic threat to the United States,' Cheney said .
'Our president must understand that we are at war,' he said, 'and we must do what it takes for as long as it takes to win'"
"Two men have been arrested by police investigating a spate of tragic deaths among young partygoers believed to have taken contaminated ‘Dr Death’ ecstasy tablets. Five people have died in the last month – three last weekend - just hours after they apparently took the drug. Greater Manchester Police are questioning two men, aged 33 and 34, on suspicion of being concerned in supplying a controlled drug. It comes after the uncle of the first victim - Charlotte Woodiwiss - yesterday warned other young people not to risk their lives taking the recreational drug. Drug death: Charlotte Woodiwiss died in Derbyshire last month after apparently taking a contaminated drug . Jordan Chambers, 19, from Wigan, left, who died . on Sunday and Gareth Ashton, 28, right, who died on Monday. It is . thought they both took contaminated ecstasy tablets . He made the comments after the funeral of Ms Woodiwiss - who was found dead at a flat in Chapel-en-le-Frith in Derbyshire on . December 22 after apparently taking the ecstasy pill - was held earlier this week. In a heartbreaking Facebook message, . 40-year-old Matt Woodiwiss wrote: ‘I’m Charlotte’s uncle and am absolutely . devastated by my family’s loss. Our beautiful girl gone far too early. I . am heartened by the fact that so many of you have commented but let . this tragic sequence of events teach you a few things. ‘Think . long and hard about how you live your lives, about which group of . people you hang about with and about who influences you. 'It’s . all very well writing a few “nice” things on a FB wall but if you carry . on living your lives as so many of you are then – as much as it seems . like a laugh at the moment – you are running the risk of your families . being torn apart with grief like mine is. ‘So, . by all means quote the poems and write the testimonials, but don’t let . our little girl’s tragic death be in vain. Some of you have the chance . to be shining stars whilst still here, and believe me that is far better . than being one in death. ‘So remember Charlotte with . happiness, remember her vitality, carry on loving her as some of you . did, and most of all learn from this as that is the best testament that . you can give to my beautiful niece.’ It comes as police warned that a . contaminated batch of ecstasy tablets could be circulating following the . deaths of the two 'apparently fit young men' from the same town. Gareth Ashton, 28, died at Wigan Infirmary on Monday while Jordan Chambers, 19, died at Oldham Hospital on Sunday. Charlotte Woodiwiss, 20, from Chapel-le-Frith . and Dale Yates, 18, from Buxton, both died in December from apparently . taking contaminated ecstasy pills but Greater Manchester Police are not . connecting their deaths to the two men who died in Wigan . The pair, both from Wigan, were . admitted to hospital after complaining of feeling unwell and suffered . the same symptoms. Both said they had taken drugs. Greater . Manchester Police are investigating where the men had been socialising . and if they were out together when they took the pills. Superintendent Andrea Jones said several others went to hospital yesterday suffering similar symptoms but all have been released. A third man, a 26-year-old, died in . Liverpool on Sunday and is believed to have taken tablets - possibly . ecstasy - before he collapsed. Greater Manchester Police are not . currently linking his death to the two in their region, but said they . could not discount a connection. It comes after the deaths of Ms Woodiwiss . and another partygoer in Derbyshire - Dale Yates, 18, . who was discovered at a flat in Buxton on December 23. It is believed they took Dr Death, . often shaped like Love Hearts sweets and also called Pink Ecstasy, which has . the chemical name PMMA. It . is sold to clubbers for as little as £3 a pill and dealers claim it . offers a similar high to ecstasy (MDMA) but it is around five times as . strong and causes a dangerous rise in body temperature. What the contaminated tablets could look like: Pink coloured ecstasy tablets in a heart shape (stock image) The father of Dale Yates has also warned that young people are playing Russian roulette with their lives by taking the drug. Lawrence Beever, 40, said: ‘So many kids take these recreational drugs but they just don’t know what’s in them. 'They go out to parties, they see their friends taking them, so they have some too, and they don’t realise they’re playing Russian roulette. These pills are deadly.' Derbyshire Police said at the time there . was nothing to link those deaths but issued a warning about drug misuse . as they pointed out illegal drugs and so-called legal highs can have . different strengths and components. Five people were arrested on suspicion . of drug offences following the death of Mr Yates, while six people were . detained over the death of Miss Woodiwiss in Derbyshire. All the suspects were later bailed pending further inquiries. Superintendent Jones today further warned . about the dangers of drug use and said the contaminated pills are . thought to be brightly coloured heart-shaped ecstasy tablets which come . in purple, green, red or yellow. Friends paid tribute to Jordan Chambers, pictured, saying he was 'such a nice lad' who will be 'truly missed' Ms Jones urged anyone with information on such pills to come forward to help them with their inquiries. She said: 'These illegal drugs nobody knows what poisons they contain, what toxic chemicals they contain.' Toxicology tests are due to take place to establish how Mr Ashton and Mr Chambers died. The girlfriend of Mr Ashton, Catherine Fulton, 29, has also urged people to think twice before taking drugs. She said: ‘This has come as a massive shock not least because he wasn’t a drug abuser. I’d tell other people just not to do drugs. 'It ruins the people who are left behind and we have to pick up the pieces. I want this to make people think twice and I hope this opens their eyes to other people’s grief.' Det Con Ms Jones said Wigan is not thought to have . a particular drug problem and that Greater Manchester Police are . liaising with other forces. Detective . Chief Inspector Howard Millington, from Wigan CID, added that he was . concerned there could be further deaths if the drugs continue to . circulate in the area and urged anyone feeling unwell after taking . ecstasy pills to go to hospital for a check-up. 'We are very concerned at how these deaths of two apparently fit young men have occurred,' he added.

"The scraps of paper on which the very first Inspector Morse novel was penned are tipped to sell for £50,000. Crime author Colin Dexter wrote the opening paragraphs to his inaugural book featuring the famous detective while he was killing time on a rainy holiday in Wales in 1972. With no typewriter to hand, Dexter wrote out the first passages of his debut novel, Last Bus To Woodstock with a ballpoint pen in long-hand on sheets of paper. The 280-page manuscript, which was . published in 1975, shows Dexter's writing in different coloured pens as . he sets about tightening up the plot and changing passages. Creating a legend by hand: The scraps of paper on which Inspector Morse was first created are set to fetch £50,000 at auction. With no typewriter to hand Dexter wrote out the opening passages of his debut novel Last Bus to Woodstock in longhand on sheets of paper . John Thaw (1942-2002) won legions of fans as Inspector Morse, which was created for ITV and closely followed the novels by Colin Dexter, which introduced Morse with: 'It was one night...' Dexter started on the book in 1972. In a previous interview he said: 'We were in a little guest house halfway between Caernarfon and Pwllheli. It was a Saturday and it was raining - it's not unknown for it to rain in North Wales. 'The children were moaning. I was sitting at the kitchen table with nothing else to do, and I wrote the first few paragraphs of a potential detective novel.' As he worked, Dexter - keen to keep readers on their toes - removed the name of a character called Jennifer from the opening to keep her true identity a mystery until the end of the novel. Another alteration he made was to go back and change the introduction of Inspector Morse himself to make the detective's entrance more low-key. The novel was adapted for the famed . TV series Inspector Morse who was played by the late actor John Thaw and . was broadcast in 1988. Dexter gave the original draft of his first Morse book to a friend in his local pub. A private UK collector came into possession of it several years ago and has now decided to sell it at auction in London. The document has hundreds of annotations and corrections made by Dexter at the time. Dr Gabriel Heaton, a literary expert . at auctioneers Sotheby's, said: 'Dexter started writing it while he was . bored on a rainy holiday in Wales. 'It is the original manuscript of the first Morse novel, it is the moment Morse first emerges from Dexter's imagination. 'This was a series that was to prove incredibly popular and influential and is widely read both here and abroad. 'It . is an important moment in crime fiction. There are very few detectives . in crime fiction in recent years who are as instantly recognisable as . Morse.' John Thaw and Kevin Whately, as Lewis, became household favourites, after coming into the imagination of Colin Dexter (right), who wrote the first novel by hand . He added: 'This manuscript is fascinating because it is all written in long-hand and not on a typewriter like so many others we see. 'It . is extensively revised and every page has a lot of corrections on it . and revisions which serve to make the plot a lot sharper. 'We can see how Dexter is thinking in terms of character and plot details. 'He changes the text when he introduces Morse, to underplay the entrance of such an important character. 'It . is a typical Morse scene just north of Oxford, a body has been found in . a pub car park, and it is the first time Morse meets Lewis. 'For . a reader who is encountering this for the first time in the 1970s, the . introduction of Inspector Morse would slip under the radar. It is . classic detective writing. 'The estimated price reflects the importance of Dexter's writing in the genre.' Dexter's creation went on to become one of the most successful detective series of modern times. The hit TV adaptation of the novels, which also starred Kevin Whately as Morse's sidekick Lewis ran from 1987 to 2000. The Last Bus To Woodstock is about the murder of a young woman who accepts a lift while waiting for a bus. The novel then centres on the prime suspect, an Oxford don who was having an affair with the victim, gave her the lift but did not kill her. The manuscript will be sold at the Sotheby's auction on Wednesday.","Colin Dexter scribbled out Last Bus To Woodstock during rainy holiday in Wales .

"Elaine McKay, 58, is accused of starting a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy . A teaching assistant broke down in tears today as she confessed to sending a schoolboy more than 40 years her junior provocative photographs of herself. However, she vehemently denied having a physical relationship with the teenager, telling the court: 'I’ve never had sex with him.' Elaine McKay, 58, is accused of starting a sexual relationship with the 15-year-old while working at the 1,700-pupil Clacton Coastal Academy in Essex. The married teaching assistant allegedly had sex with the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, after visiting his home to drop off a friendship cake with his family. Taking to the witness stand at Chelmsford Crown Court in Essex, McKay began to cry as she admitted sending explicit pictures to the schoolboy for around a year. She also confessed to performing 'graphic sexual acts' on herself as he watched on Skype. Maria Dineen, defending, said: 'You accept that there were messages and pictures sent by you and activity on Skype that was of a sexual nature.' McKay, a mother-of-two and grandmother-of-two, replied through tears: 'Yes. Sorry, yes.' Taking a sip of water to compose herself, the teaching assistant - who has been suspended from her job - insisted it was the schoolboy who started it by asking for a picture of her. She pointed him in the direction of her Facebook picture, but then he sent her a naked photograph of himself, she claimed. She told jurors: 'Then he asked ""can I send you a picture of me?"" I said ""I don’t want a picture of you"". He said he was just going to send one anyway. He sent me a picture and when I looked at the icon I could see it was a picture of his (privates). 'I didn’t open the picture. I just deleted it. 'I was just totally shocked and I just text back saying ""What are you doing?"".' However, the 58-year-old admitted she failed to report it to her school head of department which she should have. Elaine McKay is accused of having sex with 15-year-old schoolboy while she was a teaching assistant in Essex . Instead, over the next year or so she sent a string of provocative photographs to the teenager, including naked snaps and one of her in a compromising pose. She told jurors: 'He kept pestering and asking me ""Please, just one picture, just one picture, even if it’s just a pair of knickers"".' McKay agreed there came a time when she 'effectively gave him what he was asking for'. She said the first explicit picture she sent him was a 'silly' picture of her shower that inadvertently had her underwear hanging in the background, and things escalated from there. Asked why she sent the pictures, McKay through tears said: 'I have no idea whatsoever. This is my regret. I don’t know, I don’t know the reason.' The schoolboy claims the pair had sex after McKay visited his home to drop around a friendship cake to his family. Elaine McKay agreed there came a time when she 'effectively gave him what he was asking for . His relatives were not in, and the teenager said he went and had a shower. He claims that on his return McKay was waiting in his bedroom, ripped off his towel and had sex with him. But McKay today vehemently denied having sex with the schoolboy, and insisted she had never been alone in a room with him. Ms Dineen asked: 'Did it ever become actually a physical relationship between the two of you?'McKay, who had to be asked to speak up because her voice was soft as she began her evidence, replied: 'No, never.' She added: 'I would never have had sex with him. Nothing ever physical. I would never have had sex with him, ever.' Under . cross-examination, McKay said she was terrified the schoolboy would . expose her if she ended their relationship. She admitted she was . probably subconsciously sexually attracted to the teen and said she . began sending pictures to the schoolboy for 'a joke' and 'banter'. But she admitted being foolish in having . an 'inappropriate relationship' with the teen and told jurors: 'I hold . my hands up to it. It’s my biggest regret.' Pressed over why she continued to send the explicit pictures, she said: 'I hated every minute of it. I sort of switched off. 'I just saw it as something I was doing. Something I was regretting. Something I didn’t know how to get myself out of. I don’t know why I did it, I feel like I’m not talking about me when I say it.' Elaine McKay is accused of having sex with a boy while working at Clacton Coastal Academy in Essex . But she said she was too scared to put a stop to the relationship. McKay told the court: 'Each time I refused him, he would get angry with me and I thought this it. He is going to tell somebody.' However, Richard Scott, prosecuting, accused her of lying and trying to get the schoolboy to take part in the 'cover-up' by lying to his family. He said she had crossed a boundary by having sex with the teen. But McKay told the court: 'I’m not lying to you.' McKay, of Banister Close, Clacton, Essex, denies intentionally touching a boy aged 15 by having full sex with him and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. She has admitted causing a child to look at sexually explicit images.

Huge cheque: Protestors affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street protests chant outside the home of billionaire David Koch in New York on Tuesday . Placards: People representing Occupy Wall Street and other groups hold a march on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to protest policies they claim favour the super rich in New York . Beginnings: The Occupy Wall Street movement, which is protesting a wide variety of issues and started in September, is continuing in New York and is spreading to other cities around the country . Cardboard signs: Occupy Wall Street protestors stage a 'Millionaires March' in Manhattan's Upper East Side . The protesters marched to the houses of Rupert Murdoch, JP Morgan Chase . CEO Jamie Dimon, billionaire David Koch, financier Howard Milstein and . hedge fund mogul John Paulson. But Mayor Bloomberg gave his backing to Mr . Dimon, saying he is an 'honourable person' who pays taxes and has 'brought more . business to this city than maybe any other banker in the modern day'. Protesters are today expected to protest outside the headquarters of JP Morgan Chase in New York. During the march protesters were bearing . oversized cheques in an attempt to symbolise how much less the wealthy . will pay when New York's two per cent ‘millionaires' tax’ expires at the . end of the year. ‘99 per . cent of the residents of New York are going to suffer from this tax . giveaway so the one per cent who already live in absolute luxury can put . more money in their pockets,’ one organiser said. Cameramen: The media was out in force on Tuesday to cover the march, with most networks represented .

"A 'devious' mother has been jailed today for fleecing a leading Conservative out of nearly £100,000. Jeremy Middleton, one of the Tyneside's most prominent entrepreneurs, was on David's Cameron's 'A List' of election candidates, served as the Tory party's deputy  chairman, and was made a CBE in this year's Queen's Birthday honours. But behind his back, his 'trusted' finance chief Jacqueline Hayes was fleecing his bank account in 20 electronic raids after being given the 'keys to the safe'. She was jailed at Newcastle Crown Court for two and a half years for her 'cunning and devious' thefts. Leading Tory Jeremy Middleton, whose former employee Jacqueline Hayes was jailed after admitting five charges . The court heard how Hayes was given her position within Middleton's Tyneside-based empire - but then plundered tens of thousands of pounds from behind Mr Middleton's back in a slick crime spree. Hayes, from Cullercoats, North Tyneside, helped herself to the cash in a series of more than 20 'electronic' raids on one of her boss' many accounts. She chose the account deliberately because she knew it was the only one not checked by an outside auditor. And after spiriting the money away, Hayes created a smokescreen of false entries to cover her tracks. Jailing her for two-and-a-half years, Judge Roger Thorn QC told her: 'You were so greedy you may have surprised yourself with the amount you took. 'You were a highly valued employee effectively running the finances, and in part, the private life of the victim and his family. 'He was a multi-millionaire who you decided to soak.' He added: 'Moreover, he was a public figure and my guess is you took a gamble that if you were found out it would all somehow be smoothed over. 'I have now seen how capable you are of being cunning and devious.' Middleton was appointed a CBE in the 2012 Birthday Honours for political and charitable services - and made headlines in 2011 by moving into the house used for the Geordie Shore programme. Hayes, a mother-of-two, told police she was innocent when she was arrested in April last year, and then she lied from the witness box during an aborted trial earlier this year, the court heard. But only as a new trial was about to begin did Hayes finally admit five charges of theft, totalling £97,347, between August 2008 and July 2009. Judge Thorn said: 'You sought to bluster your way out of this. 'You gave lying evidence and you cast aspersions on an employer who had been nothing but kind and supportive of you.' Even after the 'gross' deceit he suffered at her hands, Mr Middleton 'bears no malice', the court heard. And references, including one in person from another successful businessman, showed a different side to her character. James Walker, mitigating said: 'She was a woman of good character. 'Clearly that has been shattered and given this conviction her further employment prospects have been devastated as well. 'She knows she made a dreadful mistake. She is extremely remorseful and it is clear she is absolutely petrified at the prospect of custody.' Investigators will now seek to recover any of Hayes available assets under a Proceeds of Crime application.","Finance chief Jacqueline Hayes stole from leading Newcastle entrepreneur Jeremy Middleton, CBE .

"Lollipop man, Barry Brannick, 68, with the camera fitted to his body . Lollipop men patrolling Britain’s 'most dangerous school crossing' are being fitted with cameras - after being knocked down by hit-and-run drivers a total of five times. The cameras were fitted to traffic monitors working outside Monks Abbey Primary School, Lincoln, this morning. The security measures have been introduced after lollipop man Dave Ellis, 41, was ran over three times, while his colleague Barry Brannick, 64, was hit twice in the last five months. The pair have also had to dive out of the way of several speeding cars after drivers refused to stop when they displayed their stop sign. Dave - who says he receives daily . abuse from angry motorists - hopes the cameras can help reduce the number of . reckless drivers who regularly speed through the two crossings. The . shocking number of accidents has led the road outside the 330-pupil . school being branded 'Britain’s most dangerous school crossing'. Video footage of crashes or near misses will be used in court to prosecute dangerous drivers. Dave, from Lincoln, started wearing the chest-mounted camera today. He said: 'It’s going to be a positive step - it’s going to make children’s lives safer and its going to make our jobs easier. 'Hopefully it will deter people from driving through and speeding but I don’t actually see them stopping accidents.' There are two crossings near the school where Dave, who mans one of the crossings, was first hit by a car in May. One . car hit him with such force his hand was shattered in two places, and . the lollipop was ripped from his hand and flung into a tree by a driver . who failed to stop. If you can read this, you're too close: The camera is seen in operation on Barry Brannick's chest . In September, Dave was hit from behind by another driver, who failed to stop while he helped pupils cross the road. His . co-worker Barry added: 'The first time I got hit was when I went after a . child in the middle of the road - it damaged my leg and I was off work . for two weeks.' Signs have also been put up to warn drivers about the recording equipment. John Siddle, from Lincolnshire Road Safety Partnership, said: 'We are trialling these cameras to combat lollipop rage. 'We are doing this for the protection of the children and the school crossing patrols, in an area that can be very dangerous. 'We want to make sure that we prevent a child getting hurt in future.' Safety first: Parents take their children to Monks Abbey Primary School, under the protection of Barry Brannick . Dangerous: Monks Abbey Primary School is close to a busy road, where drivers regularly break the speed limit . Siddle added: 'We are hoping the measures we are taking in using the video equipment will never have to be used in court. 'However, we are fully prepared that, should any driver endanger either the school crossing patrols or children, we will take all measures necessary to place that person before the courts. 'We have never known a school patrolling crossing like this one. It has to be the worst. 'The level of abuse David Ellis is receiving is terrible and drivers are simply not sticking to the rules. 'We appreciate that people are busy and in a hurry to get to places but the driving of some people in this residential area is crazy.'","Lollipop men at Monks Abbey Primary School in Lincoln hope cameras will deter drivers from speeding .

"Two men who had their convictions for the 1995 murder of a taxi driver overturned have finally been released. Eric Glisson and Cathy Watkins spent 17 years in a New York Jail, wrongly convicted for murdering livery cab driver Baith . Diop. Bronx Supreme Court Judge Denis Boyle exonerated the pair in October after hearing that gang members had confessed to the murder, and yesterday the pair finally had their ankle monitors removed. Glisson and Watkins are . among five people convicted in the murder of livery cab driver Baith . Diop, who was gunned down on January 19, 1995, amid a rash of taxi . driver murders around New York City. Imprisoned: Eric Glisson (pictured right, with his lawyer Peter Cross), was convicted in the 1995 killing of a livery cab driver in New York City . Three others who were also convicted . of the crime in 1997 - Devon Ayers, Michael Cosme and Carlos Perez - are . waiting to hear if their convictions will be convicted. However they will remain in jail over Christmas and New Year, pending their hearing on January 2. Press . accounts had described how, according to police, the Senegalese . immigrant begged for his life before being shot in the back and neck. Ballistics showed that he was shot with two .38-caliber handguns that . were never recovered. Fighting for freedom: Glisson wrote to federal prosecutors saying he'd heard the murder was the work of a gang called Sex, Money and Murder . Rather . than treat the crime as a fatal holdup, New York Police Department . detectives and prosecutors linked it to a complex conspiracy by a band . of drug dealers involved in the execution-style killing of FedEx . executive Denise Raymond two days earlier. Investigators . alleged that Diop was killed as part of a related scheme to steal a . pile of drug money that one of his passengers was carrying that night. At the first of two trials, three men were convicted in both the killing of Denise Raymond and Diop. At the second, a jury found Glisson and Watkins guilty in the cabbie homicide. All received lengthy sentences. Glisson's . lawyer said that as the years passed, his client exhausted all his . appeals before writing a letter to federal prosecutors. In it, he said . he had heard that the cabbie killing was the work of a gang called Sex, . Money and Murder, or SMM. The . letter, though addressed to a prosecutor who had left the office, by . coincidence made its way into the hands of John O’Malley - a former . Bronx homicide detective familiar with SMM, the New York Times reported. The names of Gilbert Vega and Jose . Rodriguez, two SMM members, rang a bell for O'Malley. Both men had . confessed to killing a Bronx cab driver in late 1994 or early 1995 – an . admission that couldn't be corroborated at the time. Vega and Rodriguez confessed after becoming cooperators in 2003. The . investigator re-interviewed the two men. They described again how they . were riding in a cab together when they decided to rob the driver. When . he put up a fight, they shot him and jumped out of the car without . knowing whether he was dead. Earlier . this month, Glisson and Watkins filed court papers to have their . convictions thrown out. Their next court hearing is scheduled for . October 19. 'Deep down, I . feel like the justice system failed me,' Glisson said in an interview . earlier this year. 'But you just have to try to move on.' Jailed: Glisson has been behind bars at Sing Sing prison for 17 years; it is now thought he was wrongfully convicted of murder .","Eric Glisson and Cathy Watkins were convicted for the 1995 murder of cab driver Baith Diop .

"George Galloway’s former secretary has been arrested - along with her anti-terrorism officer husband - on suspicion of data protection offences. Aisha Ali-Khan and her husband, Detective Inspector Afiz Khan, were both arrested on Wednesday on suspicions relating to the mis-use of police databases. It follows Galloway's allegations in October of 'dirty tricks' by the pair - although the arrests are not believed to be connected to his specific complaints. Accusation: Mr Galloway accused Aisha Ali-Khan (left) of a dirty-tricks campaign against him with her husband, Afiz Khan (right) Mr Galloway suspended mother-of-one . Miss Khan, 32, from her role in October - claiming the couple ran a . smear campaign against the Respect MP for Bradford West, including . encouraging the Guardian newspaper to run a piece against the party. He also claimed that the couple slept together at the MP’s house in Streatham, south London, while he was away in Indonesia. Afiz Khan, a member of the Met’s elite SO15 anti-terror squad, is suspected of misusing police . databases and abusing his position as a police officer. He has been on . restricted duties since October. A Met spokesman said: A detective inspector from specialist operations was arrested this morning at his home address in Watford. 'He has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in a public office and data protection offences.' George Galloway, pictured with wife Putri Gayatri Pertiwi, claimed the Met officer had sex with his aide in his house while he was abroad . The spokesman added: 'A . woman has been arrested [not a Met police service employee] in . connection with the DPS [Directorate of Professional Standards] . investigation at her home address in Bradford. 'She has been arrested on suspicion of data protection offences. 'The . arrests come as a result of an investigation by the DPS into a . complaint from a member of the public with regard to the actions of an . officer based within specialist operations.' In October, Galloway alleged Ali-Khan was a Met police 'agent' who was running a . 'dirty tricks' campaign to discredit the Respect party. He . showed emails between the husband and wife which he claimed supported . his claims - and the Guardian said police are 'trying to 'ascertain' how . the MP managed to get the private Hotmail emials. Ali-Khan told the newspaper the emails merely showed a husband 'counselling . his wife in how to deal with bullying and misogyny in Respect's Bradford . office.

"Hillary Clinton has a new weapon on the campaign trail  - her granddaughter Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky. While the presumed 2016 presidential candidate hasn't trotted her only grandchild out at any political events yet she's made reference to her in several speeches in the four weeks since she was born, including at a rally today for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. 'There is something about a new life in your family that really does focus you on the future, doesn't it?' Clinton told the crowd, according to Buzzfeed's Ruby Cramer. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton participates in a Women for Cuomo campaign event in New York this afternoon. At the event Clinton referenced her new granddaughter while making the case for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's reelection . Chelsea Clinton is seen here with her family, husband leaving Lenox Hill Hospital with her newborn baby Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky in New York City. Pictured from left to right: Mark Mezvinsky, Chelsea and baby Charlotte and Hillary and Bill Clinton . Chelsea Clinton is pictured here strolling around New York with her friends on Oct. 14, two and a half weeks after the birth of her first child . Hillary Clinton began inserting references to her granddaughter into remarks just five days after she was born on Sept. 26. At a real estate convention in Miami on Oct. 2 that was targeted at women, Clinton said, 'I think my granddaughter has just as much God-given potential as a boy who was born in that hospital on the same day. 'I just believe that. That’s the way I was raised,' Clinton said. And today's event for Cuomo isn't the first time Clinton has referenced Charlotte while on the stump at a political event, either. At a rally for Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf earlier this month Clinton told the audience, 'You should not have to be the grandchild of a president to get a good education, to get good healthcare. 'Let’s make sure we give every child in Pennsylvania the same chance that I’m determined to give my granddaughter,' she added. Cramer said Clinton told the audience today that their state's Democratic head is the 'right leader at the right time with the right plan' for New York. And that's 'not just because I've known Andrew Cuomo for a long time,' Clinton said. 'It is because I’m now a grandmother.' Cuomo, who has been suggested as a presidential contender himself, returned the love when he took the stage, telling Clinton, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you.' 'How much do we miss having Hillary Clinton in New York?' he then asked the crowd. 'I hope she does something really, really, really big,' he said of the state's former senator, Clinton. Cramer said at least two dozen people left the event after Clinton's speech concluded. Clinton was not one of them, though. The 2016 front runner stayed behind until the end of the event and shook hands with supporters for some time afterward. Hillary Clinton and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo acknowledge their supporters at a rally today. Clinton told the audience Cuomo is the 'right leader at the right time with the right plan' for New York. And that's 'not just because I've known Andrew Cuomo for a long time,' she said. 'It is because I’m now a grandmother' Hillary Clinton does a meet and greet with her fans after today's event in New York. As she took the stage they shouted '2016' and 'We love you Hillary!' As the former secretary of state took the stage, Cramer said the crowd didn't hold back their excitement about another Clinton presidential campaign. 'We love you Hillary!' they reportedly shouted, as well as '2016.' Clinton has said she'll make a formal announcement about her political plans sometime after the midterm elections and likely at the top of the new year. One major deterrent to a second presidential campaign that Clinton has cited is her only daughter Chelsea's first child. The former first lady said in July that she's waiting to make a decision about 2016 until she's had some time to experience the joys of being a grandparent. 'I want to see what that feels like,' she told Charlie Rose in an interview for PBS. 'I’m not going to skip over it. I want to really be present, as I meet this … new person in our family.' Clinton acknowledged that serving as the Commander in Chief is time consuming and 'has only gotten harder' since she lived in the White House. 'I just have to decide or not that’s what I want to do at this point in my life, ' she told Rose. 'It’s a very personal choice.'","The presumed 2016 presidential candidate has made reference to her in several speeches in the four weeks since she was born .

"These tourists got the experience of a lifetime during a holiday in the Maldives. While feeding fish off of a jetty, a hungry stingray saw an opportunity for a free dinner, jumping out of the water and climbing on to the man-made ramp.

The stingray jumped out of the crystal clear water and climbed up the man-made ramp toward the trainer . After his snack, the stingray stayed to be stroked by the trainer a few times . The giant stingray even stayed on after its snack to be pet a few times, delighting the tourists recording the video. Known for their barbed tail, which they usually use to capture their prey, stingrays can also be harmful to humans if a person is stung.

"The Obama administration's decision to place restrictions on travelers coming from Ebola-plagued countries is a step in the right direction, but there's still more precautions the federal government can and should be taking to protect Americans from  Ebola, Sen. Rand Paul said in a recent interview with MailOnline. 'It's good that they're admitting they were wrong,' Paul said. 'They've now changed their protocol. 'Perhaps it's also a problem to have people commercially traveling into the country with it,' though, he added. Paul, a physician by trade, has been especially critical of the Obama administration's approach to containing Ebola. He has suggested several times over the last month that the virus is 'incredibly contagious', and the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention is downplaying the threat it poses to Americans. There's still more precautions the federal government can and should be taking to protect Americans from Ebola, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told MailOnline during a trip to Atlanta, Georgia, this weekend . Paul was in Atlanta to stump for Georgia's GOP nominee to the U.S. Senate, David Perdue, right. He is seen here with Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson, center, and pastor Benny Tate, right, at a rally on Friday afternoon . In his interview with MailOnline from Atlanta, Georgia, where the CDC is headquartered, the Kentucky senator and possible 2016 presidential candidate again chided the government agency for failing to explain to Americans how easily Ebola can be caught. As in recent remarks, Paul chalked the move up to over eagerness by the government agency to be politically correct. Even so, the CDC needs to be 'forthright' about how easily transmittable the disease is, he said. 'I think we have the greatest healthcare system in the world and in all likelihood we can contain this and, so, I believe It's important not to spread panic,' he said. 'But I think sometimes people panic more if you're not honest with them.' Paul has challenged the CDC's assertion that Americans are not in danger of contracting Ebola unless they come in direct contract with a carrier's bodily fluids. 'You know how they define direct contact? Being within three feet of someone,' Paul has said. The CDC's explanation for how the disease is transmitted makes it sound like it's passed on in a manner similar to AIDS, Paul contends. But 'you're not going to get AIDS at a cocktail party. No one's going to cough on you, and you're going to get AIDS. Everybody knows that,' Paul recently told a group of college students. The Department of Homeland Security announced on Tuesday that it would require passengers whose travel originated in West Africa to fly through five international airports in the U.S. that have heightened security measures in place in order to reduce the likelihood that Ebola carriers will be able to enter the U.S. Yet. a second person who arrived from West Africa has been diagnosed with Ebola since the new travel restrictions were put in place. Because the man, a doctor who had just finished treating Ebola patients in West Africa, was not showing symptoms of the disease at the airport, he was allowed to pass into the country through New York. As a result both New York and nearby New Jersey had independently announced that they would quarantine all persons who have recently traveled to an Ebola hot spot until the 21-day incubation period for the virus has expired. Already one woman who was quarantined under the new rules has fallen ill with Ebola-like symptoms. She tested negative for the disease, however. President Barack Obama has defied calls from more than 100 Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill to temporarily close the country's borders to travelers from West Africa, even as the number of people worldwide who have been diagnosed with Ebola has climbed to more than 10,000 people. The World Health Organization said Saturday that nearly half of people who tested positive for Ebola have died. And WHO said the infection rate could actually be higher - those are just the known cases. Only 27 of those cases have been outside West African countries Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Still federal lawmakers worry that the virus could become spread en mass in the United States. Health workers in Monrovia, Liberia, suit up in protective clothing before taking people suspected of having Ebola to a  holding center on October 17, 2014. The World Health Organization says that more than 4,500 people have died in the Ebola epidemic savaging West Africa . President Barack Obama gives a hug to Dallas nurse Nina Pham in the Oval Office of the White House on Friday in Washington, D.C. Pham, a nurse who was infected with Ebola after treating the first person diagnosed with Ebola on U.S. soil, was declared free of the virus on Friday . Georgia politicians who represent the Atlanta area, home to the CDC, expressed worry of a potential Ebola epidemic, but they were careful not to conflate the government agency's response to the potential crisis with the president's or to affirm Paul's allegations. 'I think Tom Frieden, the CDC director is a good man, is a good doctor, and I think basically has done a good job,' Republican Rep. Phil Gingrey told MailOnline. 'Sometimes I wonder if he's actually calling the shots. I would say the same thing for Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, who I have a lot of respect for as the [National Institute of Health] director of allergy and infectious diseases,' Gingrey said. The seven-term Republican congressman suggested that the Ebola response coordinators may just be figureheads. 'The American people have so little confidence now in this administration, they're thinking well, who is making these decisions? Is it the medical experts like Dr. Frieden and Dr. Fauci? Or is it somebody in the administration who is telling them what to do?' he said. Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson, who has represented the Peach State in Congress since 1999, also refused to bad-mouth the CDC or its leader. 'I have a high regard and respect for Tom Frieden. Tom Frieden admitted when he made a mistake in terms of the Dallas situation, quickly corrected it,' Isakson told MailOnline during an interview at a campaign rally over the weekend. 'All four patients at Atlanta University have been cured. I think the CDC has done an excellent job, and I support Tom Frieden,' Isakson, a member of the Senate's Health committee said. Georgia Rep. Phil Gingrey, center, questions, top U.S. health officials appearing before a House panel about the Ebola outbreak on Thursday. In an interview with MailOnline after an early vote rally with Paul this weekend, the GOP nominee for Georgia's soon to be open Senate seat, David Perdue, abstained support for his campaign surrogate's claims about Ebola. 'I'm not a scientist or a doctor. He's a physician,' the businessman said. But if he's is right, Perdue added, 'then it's...a major...potentially a very large crisis, and we need to treat it as such. 'And that means that we've got to set up the right protocols, the right controls, with the right leadership,' he noted. 'What I'm concerned about right now is we're not seeing strong leadership out of the White House' on the issue.' Gingrey, who is a doctor, also demurred when asked for his opinion of Paul's suspicions. Isakson was more candid about in his assessment of colleague's theories. 'I'm a member of the Health committee, and I've been a supporter of CDC for the last 16 years in Congress,' he said told MailOnline in an interview outside the Paul event. 'They don't put out false and misleading information when it comes to a disease that's life threatening.' While hesitant to comment on Paul's allegations, Gingrey, an OB/GYN who has served in Congress for more than a decade, had no reservations about criticizing the president's reaction to Ebola when he talked to MailOnline at a get out the vote event on Friday night. Asked for his thoughts on the administration's decision to enact travel restrictions on plane passengers coming from West Africa, Gingrey said it's 'too little too late.' 'It is woefully inadequate to do that,' he said. Gingrey, a member of the House Energy and Commerce's subcommittee on health, said the federal government ought to mandate that travelers coming from West Africa, including doctors, nurses and military service men and women, be quarantined inside the region for 21 days before they are allowed to proceed to the U.S. 'I don't think that's that big a burden,' he said. The GOP congressman commended all the medical professionals who have relocated to Ebola-ravaged countries to treat victims of the virus. 'They need to understand, though, with a disease like this that has a mortality rate of 75 percent, you just can't take any chances,' he said. If not an outright travel ban, Ginrgrey said, then the U.S. should at least institute a quarantine period. 'We don't want [Ebola] to turn into a pandemic, as these cases accumulate,' he said. 'That should be done in another continent. We shouldn't bring them to this continent and run the risk of going from an epidemic in West Africa to a pandemic in the world. 'So I think that not nearly enough has been done,' Gingery said. New Jersey and New York have set a new standard by instating their own quarantines, he said. 'But I'd like to see this be done in West Africa.'","There's still more precautions the federal government can and should be taking to protect Americans from Ebola, Paul said .

"Killer and rapist: Jorge Torrez has indicated that he would rather face the death penalty than trial for the murders of two Illinois girls in 2005 and laughed when he heard one of the girl's father's was convicted of the killings . An ex-marine charged with fatally stabbing and raping two young girls in 2005, might never stand trial for their killings - and laughed when he was told the father of one of the children wrongly spent five years in prison for the crime. Illinois native, Jorge Torrez, was found guilty earlier this month of another murder - that of Navy sailor Amanda Snell - and has refused to defend himself as the jury decides whether to sentence him to death or life without parole for that crime. Indeed, as part of that process in the Virginia court room, the jury heard the frantic and horrifying 911 call made by the wrongly imprisoned Jerry Hobbs, after he discovered the mutilated bodies of his daughter, Laura Hobbs, 8, and her friend Krystal Tobias, 9. That horrifying crime occurred in Lake County in Illinois and authorities there are keen to have Torrez stand trial - despite his insistence on being put on death row. The Virginia court were shown graphic pictures of the crime scene and heard Hobbs, who is now, 43, moaning in the background after he and Laura's grandfather, Art Hollabaugh, made the gruesome discovery in a nearby park. Hollabaugh traveled to Virginia to speak at the sentencing hearing of Torrez on Tuesday. Guilt: Torrez is charged with the killing of two young girls in 2005 in his hometown of Zion — 8-year-old Laura Hobbs (left) and 9-year-old Krystal Tobias (right) Wrongly conviction: Jerry Hobbs had pleaded not guilty in the stabbing deaths of his 8-year-old daughter, Laura, and her friend, 9-year-old Krystal Tobias in Zion, about 50 miles north of Chicago - but a jury decided otherwise after he confessed after an alleged case of police brutality . 'Jerry started screaming that he found the girls and they were dead,' Hollabaugh said according to the Chicago Tribune. 'I told him 'No, they're not.' Judge Liam O'Grady then cautioned jurors they were about to see 'disturbing' images. Authorities in Illinois initially charged Laura's father with the killings, after prosecutors say a 20-hour interrogation yielded a false confession. But DNA evidence eventually led authorities to Torrez. Torrez has ordered his lawyers not to fight prosecutors' case for execution. Asked if Torrez was now welcoming the death penalty, his lawyer said to the court on Tuesday: 'That is a fair and reasonable deduction.' He said Torrez continues to maintain he did not kill Snell, 'but he understands he has been convicted and he will either spend 60-odd years of his life locked away in a supermax (prison) or he gets the death penalty.' Family grief in 2005: Prosecutors alleged Hobbs killed them because he was angry his daughter was outside when she was supposed to be home. Police said Hobbs confessed to the slayings, but his attorneys said the confession was coerced . Earlier this month, a jury in U.S. District Court in Alexandria convicted Jorge Torrez, 25, of killing Navy Petty Officer Amanda Snell in July 2009. Both lived in the barracks on Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall in Arlington County. Torrez is already serving a life sentence for abducting three women in Arlington, raping one of them repeatedly and leaving her for dead. He is also charged in the killing of two young girls in 2005 in his hometown of Zion — 8-year-old Laura Hobbs and 9-year-old Krystal Tobias. Laura’s father, Jerry, was originally charged in that case and spent five years in custody until the DNA evidence pointed to Torrez. Hobbs said he was coerced into a false confession. Illinois prosecutors are still waiting to put Torrez on trial. Denials: Jerry Hobbs vehemently denied the brutal killings and was freed in 2010 by a court in Illinois . Torrez was only 16 at the time of the girls’ deaths. Lake County State’s Attorney Mike Nerheim said he wants to try Torrez for the Zion killings as soon as possible. The case should be tried locally in “the interest of justice,” Nerheim said. 'The alternative would be for me to simply dismiss this case, and two little girls lost their lives as a result of his conduct,' Nerheim said. Snell’s murder went unsolved for nearly two years. Even though she was found stuffed into a wall locker with a pillow case over her head, the medical examiner did not rule her death a homicide, and the autopsy found no signs of sexual assault. After Torrez was arrested in the Arlington abductions in 2010, DNA evidence through semen connected him to the slayings in Illinois and to Snell’s murder. Torrez lived eight doors down from Snell in the barracks. Scant consolation: Jerry Hobbs received a payout of $8 million for his wrongful conviction - but his daughters killer may yet not see trial . Jurors also heard recordings of a confession Torrez made to an inmate who was acting as a confidential informant. The same informant told police that Torrez laughed when he was told that Hobbs was convicted of his own daughters murder and that of her friend. Despite his confession, Hobbs always maintained it was beaten out of him by police. At the time of his release in 2010, the-then Lake County State's Attorney Michael Waller said he was not convinced that Hobbs didn't have a role in the killings, but he said he didn't believe the case could be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Regardless, Hobbs received $8 million in compensation in 2012 for his wrongful conviction and imprisonment. In 2005, investigators quickly decided that Hobbs was the prime suspect after he discovered both the girls face up and side by side in Beulah Park in Zion the day after Mother's Day. Hobbs, who had recently been released from a Texan prison had a history of drunken violence - including a rampage with a chainsaw in a trailer park in 2001. After a 20-hour interrogation, Hobbs signed a statement admitting to the killings, according to court records. He later recanted.","Jorge Torrez, 25, is currently facing sentencing in Virginia for the murder of US Navy sailor, Amanda Snell .

"Relief etched on their face, these African immigrants say goodbye to their inflatable dinghy, and hello to the reassuring sturdiness of the a Coast Guard boat. Spanish officials say Coast Guard vessels from southern Spain and Morocco have rescued 27 migrants on four inflatable dinghies in the Strait of Gibraltar in the last 24 hours. Officials said some of the migrants trying to reach Spain from Morocco jumped into the sea when the two countries' rescue vessels approached them Monday. They were desperate to be picked up by the closer Spanish boats that would take them to Europe - instead of back to North Africa.

"Unidentified: The man is believed to be African and aged between 20 and 30 years old . Detectives are releasing images of a man they wish to identify after his body fell from the under carriage of an incoming flight to Heathrow airport. Police were called to Portman Avenue, Mortlake, which lies on the south . bank of the Thames, at 8am on Sunday, September 9, following reports that a body had fallen from the sky. The man has never been identified, but he . is believed to be African and aged between 20 and 30 years old. The police today released two images of the man, after 'substantial inquiries' failed to . identify the man. It is thought the man’s body dropped from the aircraft undercarriage as the plane came in to land. Aviation experts say the man was probably . dead before he hit the ground either because he had been crushed by the . retracting landing gear shortly after the plane took off, or because of . the extreme cold at high altitude. The man, who was 5 feet 4 inches tall and of slight build, was not a member of air crew or a passenger. At . the time, residents on the tree-lined road in Mortlake, which is  less than ten miles from the airport, spoke of their . shock on finding the body after hearing a loud bang. One said: '‘It is unbelievable. The first thing I thought when I saw the body was that it must have fallen from quite a height.' A post-mortem was held at Kingston Hospital Mortuary on September 11 and gave the cause of death as multiple injuries. A spokesman said: 'It is possible he was . from Angola as he was found with Angolan currency in his possession and . inquiries have established that a flight from Luanda, Angola was . overhead prior to the body being found.' The man was wearing jeans, a grey hoody and white trainers when he fell, and he has a tattoo on his left arm of a distinctive emblem with the letters ' Z ' and 'G ' clearly visible. Detectives initially believed Mr Matada was from Angola as he had the country's currency on him when he was found in the street in Mortlake, pictured . Probe: Forensics were on the scene in the affluent London suburb after the extraordinary incident . Detectives are now working with the Mozambique authorities to try to find his next of kin. They had previously released images of his distinctive tattoo in a bid to identify him . Location: Home: The only evidence left on the scene in Mortlake, south west London, was dark smears on the pavement where the blood was cleared up . A Civil Aviation . Authority spokesman said a stowaway in an aircraft undercarriage was unlikely to survive as he would either be crushed by the wheels after take-off . or freeze in temperatures as low as minus 40C (minus 40F). He said: ‘The chances of survival for a stowaway are very slim, particularly in the recess of the landing gear. ‘I don’t know of anyone who has survived being stowed away on a long-haul flight. ‘When the landing gear comes down at . the other end, a few miles from the runway and about 2,000ft in the air, . if there is a person who had died they would fall out.’ The discovery came just over a . fortnight after the body of a stowaway was found in the landing gear . recess of a BA plane arriving at Heathrow from Cape Town.

"Months after the death of the Mars rover Spirit, its surviving twin is poised to reach the rim of a vast crater to begin a fresh round of exploration. Driving commands sent up to Opportunity directed the six-wheel rover to make the final push towards Endeavour crater, a 14mile-wide depression near the Martian equator that likely could be its final destination. At its current pace and barring any hiccups, Opportunity should roll up to the crater's edge any day now. Slowly but surely: Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity makes its way to its destination - the Red Planet's vast Endeavour crater - in this image taken last month. It is due to arrive at the equator site any day now . The journey, which took nearly three years culminated on Tuesday when Opportunity signalled it had arrived at the location dubbed Spirit Point in honour of the rover's twin, which fell silent last year . The finish line was a spot along a ridge that the rover team nicknamed Spirit Point in honour of Opportunity's lost twin. Scientist Ray Arvidson, of Washington . University in St Louis, who is part of the team, said: 'I'm totally . pumped. We've been driving for so long.' The . milestone injects a sense of adventure back into a mission that wowed . the public with colour portraits of the landscape and the unmistakable . geologic discoveries of a warm and wetter past. The . Nasa rovers parachuted to opposite sides of Mars in 2004 for what was a . planned three-month mission, but both have operated way beyond . expectations. Explorer: An artist's impression of what Opportunity looks like as it trundles across the Martian surface . Almost there: Opportunity used its panoramic camera to capture this view of a portion of Endeavour crater's rim last week after a drive during the rover's 2,676th day of working on Mars . Spirit's . journey ended in May after Nasa ceased trying to contact it. It had been . trapped in sand and unheard from for more than a year. Opportunity . has been on a driving spree since 2008 after it crawled out of a much . smaller crater and trundled south toward Endeavour, stopping . occasionally to sightsee and examine rock outcrops. Unlike . the early days of the mission when the public tracked Opportunity's . every move, the march to Endeavour has been largely low-key. In . early 2009, Opportunity caught its first peek of the uplifted rim on . the horizon. At the time, scientists were unsure if the rover would make . it all the way. Opportunity lands on Mars in 2004. This image taken by the rover shows its landing 'bag' which bounced along the surface carrying the robot . Hardy: Opportunity seen here during testing on Earth . The roughly seven-mile journey took longer than the estimated two years to fulfil. Opportunity, . driving backwards to prevent its right front wheel from wearing out, . could not travel as the crow flies because of dangerous obstacles. So it . took a circuitous route and ended up driving twice the distance. Project . manager John Callas, of the Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said . Endeavour crater is arguably the most important science target since . landing. Craters are . carved by asteroids or comets impacting into the Martian surface and . exposing geological layers from different points in history. Endeavour . is the fourth crater that Opportunity will explore and offers the oldest . deposits yet.

"A police officer accused of describing three black men as ‘f*****g monkeys’ claimed he was just having a discussion about ‘evolution,’ a court heard today. PC Kevin Hughes, 42, allegedly made the racist remark while on patrol with three fellow officers in Newham - one of London’s most ethnically diverse communities. As they passed three black men leaning against a wall in Green Street, Upton Park, the officer allegedly said: ‘Look at them, they look like f***ing monkeys.’ But Hughes told Westminster Magistrates he had simply remarked on a man’s gait and posture while talking about the scientific theory to PC Costas Dakoutros . ‘I had engaged with PC Dakoutros, we were discussing about evolution or terms of that kind,’ he said. ‘We were in the car, I had a fleeting glance to my right hand side and saw a gentleman. I said that man there was walking like a monkey. Hughes said that when challenged by PC . Dakoutros, he immediately replied that 'it’s nothing to do with him . being black,' but he was 'just trying to reference by point that some . human beings have some characteristics that resemble monkeys.' He added that he considered his own ‘sticking out ears’ to resemble that of a monkey and that others’ noses or lips might also do so. During the discussion he also said black people were closely related to ‘chimpanzees and Neanderthals,’ it is claimed. When asked if he had used either of the words, he said might have used the former, but did not even know what Neanderthal meant. Cross-examined by prosecutor Kate Wilkinson, he admitted that he was aware of the racial connotations between black people and monkeys and that he had described the man on the street as walking like monkey. But Hughes told the court that he found it ‘upsetting’ and ‘ridiculous’ that he was being accused of being racist. He admitted that he would often greet his colleagues on the VOLT team, based at Forest Gate Police Station, by using an Asian accent and saying ‘Hello Auntie.’ But he maintained that he was not being racist and meant no disrespect. He also denied that on one occasion he had told PC David Hair, 42, that they could not use the words in front of a Asian special constable in case she complained. The former personal trainer added the he had ‘many, many, many’ Asian friends, as well as black friends, Irish friends and Australian friends. It is alleged his co-defendant PC Hair made a racist comment towards a female black colleague, asking her if she was going to go home and ‘cook bananas’. Hughes, of Ingrave, Essex, and Hair of Epping, Essex, both deny one count of using threatening, abusive, or insulting words or behaviour to cause another person harassment, alarm, or distress, and that it was racially aggravated. The trial continues . PC David Hair (left) and PC Kevin Hughes (right) denied their comments - overheard by a colleague - were racist .

"A 50-year-old man was arrested today in connection with the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, Scotland Yard has revealed. Met Police officers raided his home in Welling, south-east London, and made the 10th arrest since the execution of the 25 year old last Wednesday. and continue to search his house. It came as three men who were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby have been released on bail. The trio, aged 21, 24 and 28, were arrested in south-east London on Saturday, three days after the 25-year old soldier was hacked to death in Woolwich. They have been bailed to return to a south London police station. A fourth man who was arrested in Highbury Grove, north London, Scotland Yard yesterday, remains in custody. Scroll down for exclusive video . Three men arrested on Saturday over the death of Drummer Lee Rigby last week have been released on bail . Police with machine guns stormed three separate addresses in simultaneous raids across south-east London between 6pm and 6.30pm on Saturday. On the Lamb Estate in Greenwich, officers in balaclavas charged in to a first-floor flat and used a Taser on one suspect. They arrested a Somali man and another unarmed man, both in their 20s. Officers from the Met's Counter . Terrorism Command supported by specialist firearms officers raided a . separate fourth-floor flat 300 yards away, believed to be the home of . relatives of the Somali. Police raided a flat in Greenwich where they arrested two men on suspicion of conspiracy to murder . Armed officers wearing balaclavas arrested a man on a street Hnear Highbury Corner in connection with Drummer Rigby¿s murder . The two men suspected of murdering . Drummer Rigby, who have been identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, and . Michael Oluwatobi Adebowale, 22, remain in a stable condition in . hospital, police added. Peter Clarke, former head of counter . terrorism at Scotland Yard, said that he believed Adebolajo and . Adebowale were part of a bigger terror network. ‘Clearly these people this week . weren’t lone wolves,’ he told Sky News. ‘We know that they associated . with other people with a similar way of thinking and the thing is that . underpinning everything they do, there is an ideology. The dramatic daytime arrests by police wearing . balaclavas means there are now six terror suspects being held over the . death of Drummer Lee Rigby . Armed counter- terrorism officers arrested four young men within 24 hours on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder . Armed officers in balaclavas leapt out of an unmarked van and raided a flat in Greenwich . ‘So when you are attacking a network, . you are attacking an organisation or structure but when you’re looking . at individuals, you have to understand how far they have been poisoned, . how far their actions have been influenced by the pernicious ideology . that violent extremism has.’ The potential existence of a terror . cell may not have been spotted before because it did not plan a large . attack like the failed airline bomb plots of 2006, experts said. Witnesses said they leapt out of a silver car and a white van near Highbury Corner around 2.45pm. The man was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder and last night was being questioned. One witness, who did not wish to be . named, said: ‘The guy was on a push bike when the police came out of . nowhere and wrestled him to the ground.’ On Saturday afternoon armed officers in balaclavas leapt out of an unmarked van and raided a flat in Greenwich, south London.

Meanwhile, two people have been . arrested on suspicion of arson after a fire was discovered shortly . before 10pm yesterday at the Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre, in Weelsby . Road. The fire was extinguished and no one was injured, Humberside Police said. Drummer Rigby was hit by a car and . then attacked with weapons including a knife and a meat cleaver but the . cause of his death has not been confirmed by a post-mortem examination. The . young father's murder has provoked a backlash of anger across the . country, with many incidents of mosques being attacked, racial abuse and . comments made on social media. Drummer Rigby had survived Taliban . bombs and bullets during a tour of duty as a machine gunner in . Afghanistan, only to be slaughtered on the streets of London. On Saturday his family paid tribute to the soldier they described as their 'hero'. A great character: Father of one and soldier Rigby, of Greater Manchester, pictured relaxing on Army leave . 'Dear soldier': A handwritten note left in honour of Lee Rigby close to the scene of the brutal murder in Woolwich . 'Lee's dream growing up was always to join the Army, which he succeeded in doing.

"Al Qaeda has released the latest edition of its English-language propaganda magazine advising would-be militants on how to torch parked cars and cause traffic accidents. The Islamist movement's most active branch Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, published the tenth edition of its glossy quarterly called Inspire on militant websites this month. Along with tips on terrorism, it also warns France to pull back from Mali and lists 11 public figures in the West, including author Salman Rushdie, who it says are 'wanted dead or alive for crimes against Islam' and carries articles commemorating 'martyrs' who have died for its cause. Issue 8 of Inspire magazine, released in 2011, was full of bomb-making tips and propaganda . AQAP, based in the impoverished, lawless state of Yemen, has previously plotted to bring down international airliners. It is seen by Western governments as a danger to oil-producing Gulf states and major crude shipment routes. In a section entitled 'open source jihad', the magazine gives tips on how to set fire to parked cars, including advice such as 'don't get petrol on yourself', and suggests spilling oil on road bends to cause crashes. An editorial in the magazine warned France to end its military intervention in Mali, citing the U.S. experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, which it said made 'them bite their fingertips in regret'. The magazine also called on militants to attack 11 public figures in the West, including Rushdie, whose 1988 novel The Satanic Verses was seen by many Muslims as blasphemous. Among others are Dutch politician Geert Wilders and Canadian-Somalian activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, both strong critics of Islam, and U.S. pastor Terry Jones, who staged a public burning of copies of the Koran. Dangerous: The magazine contains tips on terrorism, including how to fire a gun . The magazine is published by the Islamist movement's most active branch Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP . The contents page of issue 8 shows the magazine carries a series of articles including a letter from the editor section . In a prominent feature, titled 'No Parking! Are There Any Safe Parking Lots Out There,' an author identified as Ibnul Irhab lays out step-by-step procedures for lighting multiple cars in the same, vacant parking lot ablaze, turning it into a massive explosion. 'The West should taste some burning. They should pay for bombarding and burning our Muslim brothers and sisters’ homes and our Holy (Koran). For burning down forests, plantations and houses, please refer to Issue 9,' the author writes. 'All you need is cooking oil, this tip-sheet says, to wreak havoc on a curvy highway. 'Today we have something new for you, VEHICLES. Vehicle are easy to torch. And the easy part is, vehicles need to be parked somewhere, right? How safe is that somewhere, especially in deserted areas? How much more safe will the West feel parking their vehicles, when they know they’re up for a TORCHING.' Propaganda: A page from issue 8 of Inspire, showing a 'convoy of martyrs' The issue also carried an article on remote control detonation, giving details instructions on how to set off a bomb . Irhab's specific instructions for carrying out the horrific plot include, 'find a deserted parked car,' 'avoid CCTV cameras or areas where people can see you' and, of course, 'pour the petrol on the vehicle(s), do not forget the tires. You can pour a line away from the vehicle.' Another terrifying feature titled 'Causing Road Accidents,' by an author identified only by the alias AQ Chef, outlines how, 'following simple instructions,' you, too, 'can carry out a lethal ambush.' 'There is no retaliation face to face, just place and vanish,' states the article, which painstakingly reveals how to grease windy roads with oil so thoroughly that cars slip off it and crash. AQAP has continued to publish the magazine four times a year, even after one of its main writers, 26-year-old Samir Khan, from North Carolina, was killed in a September 2011 drone strike in Yemen along with fellow contributor Anwar al-Awlaki. Writer: Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric linked to Al Qaeda in Yemen, was killed in a drone strike . Several people in the U.S. and UK jailed for terrorist-related offences has been found in possession of the magazine. In December a young graduate whose brothers are . serving prison sentences for planning a terrorist attack on the London . Stock Exchange, was jailed for downloading Al-Qaeda it to her mobile phone. Ruksana Begum, 22, who has a first-class degree in accountancy, had two editions of Inspire, including articles such as 'Targeting the populations of countries that are at war with the Muslims'. Ms Begum's brothers, Gurukanth Desai, 30, and Abdul Miah, 25, were sentenced to 12 and 16 years respectively in February last year for their part in the plot. In October, the foreign student arrested over an . attempt to blow-up the New York Federal Reserve cited the publication as inspiration for his deadly plans. Quazi Nafis, 21, reportedly learned how to make a bomb from an . article in Inspire. One issue specifies how to create a . remote-controlled bomb with a list of ingredients and parts followed by a . photographic manual. Another issue suggested that a good way to forward the jihadist mission would be to mow down pedestrians in a pick-up truck. Handgun training and tips on being an 'urban assassin' are also included in the easily accessible terrorist magazine online.","Most active branch publishes detailed guide on militant websites .

"The abridged story of Michael Grant reads as follows. A natural, muscle-bound athlete who excelled at baseball, basketball and American football; poor grades forced him to shelve his college dreams and try his hand at boxing. Grant fought just 12 times as an amateur before turning professional and of his first 31 fights, only seven went the distance. He was heavyweight boxing’s next big thing. Until he ran into Lennox Lewis at the turn of the millennium. Michael Grant lands a punch on Obed Sullivan during his win in 1998 and was considered the next big thing . Grant came up short when he faced Lennox Lewis at Madison Square Garden in 2000 . The newly-crowned undisputed champion of the world knocked Grant down three times in the first round before finishing him in the second. Grant would never get another shot at the title and his most recent fight was a fifth-round stoppage defeat last year at the age of 42. Born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and standing at the same 6ft 7in as Grant, Deontay Wilder also dreamed of making it on the football field or the basketball court but his life changed after the birth of his daughter Naieya in 2005. Instead of playing as a wide receiver or a forward, he stepped into a boxing gym for the first time. And so began a whirlwind journey. A two-year amateur career culminated in a bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics and, after just 30 fights, he turned professional. Deontay Wilder won an Olympic bronze medal Beijing Games in 2008 after just 30 amateur fights . Wilder takes on WBC world champion Bermane Stiverne (left) in Las Vegas on Saturday night . Wilder weighs in ahead of his first world title shot as he bids to prove he's the real deal . Seven years later, on Saturday night at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Wilder has his chance to win a world title against the WBC champion Bermane Stiverne in one of the most meaningful and anticipated heavyweight fights of the last decade. He is two years older than Grant was but his record is even more impressive: 32 knockouts from as many fights. He has never been beyond the fourth round. But Wilder’s resume is constantly under scrutiny. His best win to date is a first-round stoppage of Malik Scott last year but his record is also littered with names like Audley Harrison, Jason Gavern and Matthew Greer. ‘I think this is definitely my chance now to shut the critics up, the naysayers, the haters, the non-believers, the a*******, the d******** or whatever you want to call them – I’m ready to shut them all up,’ he says. ‘We’ll see if he [Stiverne] is a test or not. Like I say, many came before him who were supposed to be a test for me and I made the impossible possible by knocking them out when I wasn’t supposed to do it, and now they suddenly became bums, so we’ll see on Saturday if he is a true test. ‘I feel no matter what I do there’s still going to be somebody out there with an opinion on something and there’s always going to be someone out there with something to say so I’m not trying to please nobody.’ Wilder has a perfect professional record having won all 32 of his fights by knock out before the fifth round . Wilder beat Britain's Audley Harrison with an impressive first round knock out in 2013 . Wilder (left) lands a punch on Jason Gavern in their heavywieght fight at StubHub Center in August 2014 . While there is no doubting his power, Wilder has never been in trouble in a professional ring. And he has never faced anyone like Stiverne. The Haitian, born the youngest of 14 children, moved to Miami when he was 10 and turned to boxing when injury curtailed a promising football career. He has also spent time in Canada but has lived in Las Vegas for a decade. Stiverne knocked out his first dozen opponents before suffering a surprise defeat to Demetrice King. A six-round draw with Charles Davis would be the only other blot on his record before his double-header with Chris Arreola thrust him into the limelight. Promoted by Don King, who is enjoying perhaps his final fling at the top of the heavyweight game, Stiverne outpointed Arreola in their first meeting before the pair clashed again for the vacant WBC title last May following Vitali Klitschko’s retirement. This time, Stiverne knocked Arreola down twice before the referee stepped in to halt his punishment. Stiverne is the reigning WBC heavyweight champion and will provide a real test for Wilder . ‘It’s going to be a real fight, a fight like you’ve never seen before,’ the champion says. ‘I’m no cab driver, I’m no one-hit wonder, this is the real deal. This belt here isn’t going anywhere. This green belt is staying right here. ‘Everyone who has supported me, you won’t be disappointed. I’ve seen plenty of guys like Wilder, even guys who talk more than him. ‘It’s going to be a short night. It’s going to be painful - really painful. And I will send him home with no belt. If he has not gone past four rounds, that is not my business ‐ that is his business. ‘All I have to say is that after Saturday, all the people that had questions about this man will get the answers - more than the answers. I don’t care if he went 24 rounds or whatever it is. It doesn’t matter. All I am saying is I can’t wait. ‘After this fight you will never ever hear about Deontay Wilder.’ It is eight years since America had a heavyweight champion of the world when Shannon Briggs reigned for seven short months. The dominance of Wladimir Klitschko, who holds the other three major belts, has diluted interest in what was once the greatest prize in sport. ‘That’s definitely the significance behind it [this world title fight],’ says Wilder. ‘Just bring the belt back. It’s been a long time coming. A lot of Americans have been yearning for an American champion – they want an American champion, they want the excitement. WBC heavyweight champion Stiverne and Wilder go head-to-head at the pre-fight press conference . ‘If any fighter in America is up for that job then hands down it’s me. I’ve got everything. I’m the total package - I’m entertaining, I’m exciting, I got charisma and I’ve got that one-punch knockout power, that’s what everyone comes to see.’ Wilder is certainly entertaining; but he is also unpredictable. Last year, he beat up internet troll Charlie Zelenoff who had harassed the boxer on social media and made comments about his daughter who has spina bifida. The video went viral but asked serious questions about his temperament. ‘People don’t know what it took me to get here,’ he adds. ‘Nothing has been given to me and I appreciate every little thing I have. This made me who I am in life. ‘I knew it was going to take hard work to get that belt and I’m ready for that test. This is my time; I don’t think my opponent understands purpose because this is my time. ‘When I do the unexpected, I don’t want you all to degrade this man, Stiverne. I don’t want anyone to make excuses for my victory. Stick by your word. Let this be a test for me and watch me pass my test. I guarantee I will do it.’ Wilder takes verbal shots at Stiverne during the pre-fight press conference . Stiverne vs Wilder is live on BoxNation on Saturday night.

"Hate preachers will be banned from British television, Theresa May signalled last night. The Home Secretary condemned the BBC and other broadcasters for interviewing ‘disgusting’ extremist cleric Anjem Choudary after the murder of soldier Lee Rigby. In a dramatic escalation of the rules on hate preachers, Mrs May said she will ask broadcasting watchdog Ofcom to step in. Home Secretary Theresa May (right) condemned the BBC and other broadcasters for interviewing extremist cleric Anjem Choudary (left) after the murder of soldier Lee Rigby . Under plans to be drawn up by a new task force on extremism, Ofcom is expected to win powers to stop hate preachers appearing on television. At the moment the quango has the power to intervene only after an inappropriate broadcast has been made. The move is the most dramatic attempt to gag those who peddle extremist views since the Thatcher government’s 1988 ban on IRA spokesmen being heard on television, which led to the words of Gerry Adams being read out by an actor. The family of Adebolajo, pictured during a 2007 march in London, said he was harassed by MI5 in the months before the attack . As the backlash against British-based preachers of hate intensified: . Most dramatically of all, the Home Secretary and senior officials indicated the Government wants to censor broadcasters from carrying interviews in which militants incite hate. Mrs May said it was inappropriate to interview Choudary – who helped form the now-banned Islamist groups Al-Muhajiroun and Al Ghurabaa and is accused of helping to radicalise several terrorists – in the wake of Drummer Rigby’s death.

Cold-blooded: Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, with a knife in his hand after he had hacked Lee Rigby to death . Choudary, 46, described Adebolajo as a man of ‘impeccable character’ in interviews with BBC Newsnight and Channel 4 News last week. Mrs May said: ‘I think Anjem Choudary has disgusting views and I think it is right that we look at how those views are being presented. ‘There were many people who did indeed say, “What is the BBC doing interviewing Anjem Choudary?”’ A senior Home Office official said: ‘This is an issue the task force will now need to look at – whether a public service broadcaster thinks it is right to give a platform to views like this.’ Drummer Lee Rigby from the 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers who was hacked to death in Woolwich . The move could put Mrs May on a fresh . collision course with the Liberal Democrats, who have already blocked . her attempts to beef up the surveillance powers of the security . services. One Lib Dem . source described the suggestion as ‘an obvious comparison’ with the . gagging of the IRA, which was widely perceived to be a public relations . farce for the Government. The Home Secretary revealed that 2,000 people on ‘the path’ to violence had been intercepted by the authorities since the coalition came to power. She said there were ‘potentially several thousands’ more, and added: ‘We need to look at the question of whether perhaps we need to have banning orders to ban organisations that don’t meet the threshold for proscription.’ In memory: Members of the armed forces place floral tributes in Woolwich, south east London at the site where Drummer Lee Rigby died . England's finest: A cross of St George - the patron saint of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - is draped over the floral tributes . In addition, Mrs May said she wanted to reintroduce measures in the Data Communications Bill, which would allow the security services to monitor every email, phone and social network message sent by everyone in the country. The ‘Snoopers’ Charter’ Bill was dropped from the Queen’s Speech after opposition from the Lib Dems.","Home Secretary Theresa May condemned BBC and other broadcasters for interviewing extremist Anjem Choudary .

"Fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, have been put on today for alleged tax evasion. The investigation of the duo, who count pop star Madonna and model Naomi Campbell among their clients, is one of the most prominent tax cases involving celebrities in Italy. The designers, who deny any wrongdoing . and did not attend the hearing on Monday, stand accused of not declaring . taxes in Italy on royalties of around one billion euros - approximately . £760million. The case is one of the few high-profile tax disputes to go to court in Italy, where the government of Mario Monti has launched a clampdown on tax dodgers, including highly-publicised police raids in yacht marinas and chic ski resorts. On trial: Stefano Gabbana (left) and Domenico Dolce deny defrauding the Italian government of around one billion euros in taxes . Prosecutor Laura Pedio alleges the duo sold their D&G and Dolce & Gabbana brands to a holding company they set up in Luxembourg in 2004 in order to avoid paying taxes in Italy, where corporate tax rates are among the world's highest. The two Italian business partners had been cleared from accusations of tax cheating by a previous Milan court last year. But a higher court overturned the acquittal, paving the way for the trial. Madonna, a customer of D&G, pictured wearing one of their outfits at a premiere in 2008 . The designers, who draw inspiration from Sicily's and Italy's 'sweet life' style of the 1950s, have kept a low profile on the case after Gabbana lashed out at the high court's decision last year, saying on Twitter he could leave the country. 'Everyone knows that we haven't done anything,' Gabbana said in a tweet in June when the Milan court ordered the trial. Six other people, including a tax consultant, also face trial. If found guilty, they risk a sentence of up to five years in prison. At Monday's hearing, a lawyer for Dolce and Gabbana asked the court to annul the trial on grounds of alleged irregularities in the notification of court proceedings. The court will decide on the request on December 14. The designers did not comment on the case on Monday and their lawyer was not immediately reachable for a comment. Previous tax cases involving celebrities in Italy have led to out-of-court settlements, agreements that avoid long legal proceedings and possibly harsher punishments. In 2000, the late tenor Luciano Pavarotti paid more than $12 million in back taxes when he settled a four-year dispute. Argentine soccer great Diego Maradona owes some 38 million euros in unpaid taxes to Italian authorities, according to media reports. He has said he wanted to clear up his situation. Meanwhile, former MotoGP world champion Valentino Rossi agreed to pay $51 million to Italy's tax agency in 2008 after a lengthy probe. The trial continues.

"The European Union's three presidents collected the Nobel Peace Prize today in recognition of six decades of work promoting 'peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights'. Prime Minister David Cameron stayed away - one of six EU leaders who decided not to attend. Instead, deputy Nick Clegg got his own day of peace, attending alone to represent the UK in the splendour of the Nobel Institute in Oslo. Lavish: Political leaders and dignitaries gather for the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony at Oslo City Hall, Norway . The City Hall in Oslo was host to the prime ministers of Europe during the Nobel Peace Prize 2012 . Attendees heard Nobel Committee . President Thorbjoern Jagland praise the EU's role in transforming a . European 'continent of war' into a 'continent of peace'. He said: 'That should not be taken for granted - we have to struggle for it every day'. Mr Jagland emphasised that the same . prize had been awarded in the 1920s to the foreign ministers of France . and Germany marking post-First World War reconciliation. Then in the . 1930s the continent had degenerated into conflict and war once more. But he said now was the time to . celebrate prolonged peace - and welcome the French and German leaders . sitting side by side in Oslo. However, . the announcement of the peace award in October caused surprise and . controversy in the midst of one of the EU's worst crises and at a time . of deep - albeit non-violent - rifts between major member states. Today's ceremony comes in the . week of yet another EU summit to try to resolve the continuing . euro-crisis which, according to UK Independence Party leader Nigel . Farage risks 'engendering violence, poverty and despair across Europe'. A peaceful day for this deputy: Nick Clegg arrives at the City Hall for the Nobel Peace Prize presentation . President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso and President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz hold the Nobel Peace Prize certificate and medal, after accepting it on behalf of the EU . But . European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said: 'This is an . award for the European project - for the people and the institutions - . that day after day, for the last 60 years, have built a new Europe. 'We will honour this prize and we will preserve what has been achieved. It is in the common interest of our citizens. And . it will allow Europe to contribute in shaping that 'better organised . world' in line with the values of freedom, democracy, human rights and . rule of law that we cherish and believe in. 'The . last 60 years have shown that Europe can unite in peace. Over the next . 60 years, Europe must lead the global quest for peace.' Speaking after the ceremony, Nick Clegg said: 'Today's prize is a tribute to the people of Europe, not an institution. 'For centuries, the idea of Europe and peace was a contradiction in terms. 'The fact that we have not been to war with our neighbours for nearly 70 years now is a testament to the sacrifices of the generations that have gone before us and the hard work since. 'Coming from a family that was brought together in the safety of Britain after suffering the horrors of both world wars in different parts of the globe, this prize has particular resonance. 'At the start of what will be another busy week for European cooperation it has been helpful to speak to Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande and other leaders about pressing issues such as banking reform and the EU Budget.'

Queen Sonja and Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway applaud during the ceremony . Meanwhile, with more than 1,200 guests and 40 . chefs, Sweden will holds its annual awards ceremony hoping a year of . cost-cutting will not be noticed by the laureates, royals or the Who's . Who of Sweden attending the lavish dinner. The . ceremony tops a week of events in Stockholm for the winners of the . literature, physics, chemistry, medicine and economics prizes that see . Sweden briefly enjoying the kind of extravagance usually associated with . previous centuries. But . this year the prize money has been cut by a fifth, contracts with . suppliers have been renegotiated and even the number of chauffeur-driven . cars for Nobel winners and their guests has been reduced. Some . wonder whether guests will perceive any austerity in the week's events - . which last year cost around 20million Swedish crowns (£1.8million) and . usually feature Sweden's best cooks, designers and musicians, as well as . thousands of flowers flown in from Italy. Making peace: European leaders gather for a photograph after the ceremony . Hopefully peaceful discussions... German Chancellor Angela Merkel, left, and French President Francois Hollande talk as Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti looks on . 'There . have been some cuts,' Nobel Foundation Executive Director Lars . Heikensten told reporters, but refusing to give any details. 'You will . not notice them.' For more . than a century, the foundation has managed the roughly $450million . (£280million) capital that forms the base for the awards, donated in the . will of dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel. But in recent years returns have suffered amid the global crisis. 'We are in this forever and we should . safeguard it (the prize),' said Heikensten, a former Swedish central . bank chief known for reducing staff during his tenure. The awards are now worth $1.2million (£0.74million) each, down from around $1.5million (£0.9million) in recent years. Still, this evening's festivities at . Stockholm's City Hall - itself decorated with 11 kg of gold leaf - are . unlikely to be spartan. Details of the menu are only revealed . minutes before the food is served, but guests at the event - touted as . one of the world's biggest set dinners - will eat from some 7,000 pieces . of porcelain using 10,000 items of silverware and drink from 5,400 . glasses. Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee Thorbjoern Jagland speaks in Oslo City Hall during the Nobel Peace Prize 2012 award ceremony . Space is so tight guests are asked to avoid going to the toilet between courses to avoid jams in the aisle. There will also be a fair share of . bling, from jewel encrusted handbags to glittering tiaras, as Sweden's . small and influential political and business elite jettisons its famed . egalitarian image to hobnob with diplomats and political leaders from . around the globe. The strict dress code - white tie and . tails for men and gowns for women - is complemented by a similarly . strict code of behaviour. Toasting, for example, is done . Swedish style: raise your glass, look your table companions in the eyes, . swing the glass in the air ever so slightly - no clinking - sip and . repeat eye contact before setting the glass down. The formality is in stark contrast to . neighbour Norway where Australian pop-princess Kylie Minogue features . when the European Union is handed this year's Nobel Peace Prize at a . ceremony in Oslo on Monday. The EU's win raised a few eyebrows when announced in October. And Nobel week in Sweden has . attracted its share of controversy with literature winner Mo Yan . steering clear of human rights issues and refusing publicly to back a . petition by fellow laureates to free jailed compatriot and Nobel Peace .

"Graffiti mocking Hillary Clinton has been plastered across the streets surrounding a restaurant where she is hosting a fundraiser for Democratic Congressional candidates on Monday. The Tavern Restaurant in Brentwood, LA, is now covered in evil winged monkeys from the Wizard Of Oz. Instead of carrying the Wicked Witch Of The West, they are holding a sign that reads: 'Hillary 2016'. Sting: Republican street artist Sabo hung evil winged monkeys with Hillary 2016 signs along the streets surrounding the Tavern Restaurant where the former First Lady will be hosting a fundraiser on Monday . Mocking: The monkeys are fictional characters that carry the Wicked Witch Of The West in The Wizard Of Oz . It is the latest strike by the anti-Obama artist known  as Sabo, who earlier this year covered Gwyneth Paltrow's Hollywood home in posters featuring her face and the words 'Obama drone' ahead of a fundraiser for the president. Clinton's $32,400-a-head fundraiser is set to lure influential Hollywood figures including Steven Spielberg and Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn. But with just three days to go, the event has been marred by Sabo's mocking posters. He has also created a fake website for the Tavern which describes its clientele as 'big money, Hollywood Fat Cats', and other Hillary 2016 memorabilia including t-shirts and stickers. Anonymous: The artist has spent 15 years creating anti-Democrat graffiti to act as 'the other voice' in LA . Large-scale project: He revealed on his website that he has also made stickers and t-shirts to mock Hillary . Hillary Clinton has not yet confirmed she plans to bid for the Democrat presidential nomination in 2016. She has lambasted claims that her vocal presence on the mid-terms campaign trail is simply a 'warm-up', insisting she wants the focus to be on next month's candidates. However, Sabo has taken aim at the former First Lady in an overnight sting. This morning, he gleefully tweeted from the account @unsavoryagents: 'SNEAK PEEK - ABOUT LAST NIGHT' with an early morning photograph of one of the monkeys hanging from a lamp post. He told The Hollywood Reporter in an email: 'All these leftists, I'm tired of their s***'. The website describes Clinton as 'a tired old hag who can't stop wishing she was President'. On the campaign trail: Clinton has lambasted claims her vocal presence in the mid-terms is her own warm-up . For the last 15 years, LA-based Sabo has been creating right-leaning street art to be 'the other voice' in contrast with liberal graffiti artist Shepard Fairey, who designed the 2008 Obama Hope poster. According to the Unsavory Agents Facebook page, the company’s mission is not only to 'let the art world know that the left-wing will no longer hold art hostage' but to 'get more non-leftists interested and to participate in the arts.' 'Our art is politically minded, right-wing centric, brutal, street level, and hard edge,' the page reads. 'Our means are achieved by any creative means necessary.' Previous targets have included Jon Stewart, Samuel L. Jackson and Alec Baldwin.","Street artist Sabo plastered Tavern Restaurant in LA with graffiti .

"Canada will stop issuing visas to . people from the three West African nations where the Ebola is . widespread, the government said on Friday. The federal citizenship ministry, explaining the move, said . in an official document that 'the introduction or spread of the . disease would pose an imminent and severe risk to public . health'. About 5,000 people have died in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra . Leone this year in the worst Ebola outbreak on record. Fears . rose that the disease could spread beyond the region after a few . cases were diagnosed in Spain and the United States. Cut off: Visa for Canada will no longer be issues for countries affected with Ebola outbreaks, namely Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia . Banned: The ban applies to all visas for people who have been in a country with widespread Ebola transmission in the past three months . Canada - which has not reported any cases of Ebola so far - . is following in the footsteps of Australia, which on Tuesday . became the first rich nation to issue such a ban. The country's . official in charge of the response to Ebola said the move was . medically unjustified. Under the new regulations, which come into force . immediately, Canada will not process visa applications from . foreign nationals who have been in an Ebola-affected country . within the previous three months. U.S. President Barack Obama is so far resisting pressure to . impose similar travel restrictions. Codie Taylor, the chief spokeswoman for Immigration Minister . Chris Alexander, did not immediately respond to a request for . comment. Precautions: Immigration authorities said they made the decision because 'the introduction or spread of the disease would pose an imminent and severe risk to public health in Canada' During SARS, the World Health Organization issued travel advisories directing people around the world to avoid places battling severe outbreaks. It is a tool the organization has not used since. One of the places hit with a travel advisory was Toronto. Ontario's then health minister, Tony Clement -- now president of the federal treasury board -- was among those incensed by the WHO's move. Clement led a delegation to Geneva to successfully demand the WHO rescind the travel advisory against Toronto. Under the IHR, countries agree not to restrict trade or travel over and above what is recommended by the WHO during Public Health Emergencies of International Concern, known as a PHEIC. The WHO declared Ebola a PHEIC on August 8 and in doing so said countries should not close their borders to the West African countries struggling with Ebola. It has repeated that advice several times since. The IHR stipulate that countries that go beyond the WHO's recommendations have to back up their decisions with solid rationale. The latest figures from the WHO suggest at least 13,567 people have been infected since this Ebola outbreak began, and 4,951 have died. The only nations which currently meet the definition of countries with widespread and persistent, intense transmission are Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.","Canada has stopped issuing visas to people from the West African countries at the heart of the Ebola outbreak .

"A fourth American who contracted Ebola in West Africa was expected to arrive in the U.S. for care Tuesday and will be treated at an Atlanta hospital where two other aid workers successfully recovered from the disease, the hospital said Monday. Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. James Wilson said the patient, as in past cases, would be flown into Dobbins Air Reserve Base outside Atlanta. Emory University Hospital said in a news release that the patient would be treated in its isolation unit but cited confidentiality in not releasing more information about the person. The World Health Organization, however, said one of its doctors who has been working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone has tested positive for the disease. It said the doctor was in stable condition Monday in Freetown and will be evacuated. The State Department said the doctor was from the U.S. Four Ebola victims transported: Mark Rupp M.D., Chief of the Division of Infectious Disease at UNMC, and Rosanna Morris, UNMC COO,  speak to reporters about third Ebola victim Rick Sacra's arrival on Omaha Nebraska . Third Ebola patient: Rick Sacra was the third Ebola patient brought into the United States for treatment . Last month, two aid workers who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia were treated successfully at Emory. A third patient, an American doctor, who is being treated in Nebraska, appeared to be better tolerating his experimental treatments Monday, but his recovery remains uncertain. The family of Dr. Rick Sacra said he was able to eat breakfast Monday for the first time since arriving Friday at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. The 51-year-old remains in stable condition. But his wife, Debbie, said Sacra is more alert and that they had a half-hour conversation by video conference Sunday. 'He hasn't been able to eat much since he got here, but he had some toast and apple sauce,' Debbie Sacra said. 'He also tolerated the research drug well — better than he had the previous doses he was given.' Rick Sacra, a doctor from Worcester, Massachusetts, spent 15 years working at the Liberia hospital where he fell ill. He was practicing family medicine in Liberia with the North Carolina-based charity SIM. Authorities say roughly 2,100 people have died during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, but Ebola hasn't been confirmed as the cause of all those deaths. Survivor: Dr. Kent Brantly was one of the Ebola patients brought to Emory hospital and was able to survive the deadly virus . Sacra is being treated with an experimental drug that is different than the one given to the two Americans treated for Ebola at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who also work for SIM, have recovered. Sacra came to Omaha instead of Atlanta because federal officials asked the medical center to treat him in order to prepare other isolation units to take more Ebola patients if needed. Sacra's doctors have refused to name the drug they are using, but they say they've been consulting with experts on Ebola on his treatment. Dr. Aneesh Mehta of Emory University said Monday that it was impossible to know if the experimental ZMapp they received worked. Transported: The fourth victim will be transported in an ambulance to Emory Hospital where Ebola survivors were also treated . But Mehta said Emory doctors have been advising other physicians that some particular types of supportive care did seem to help. Those included switching between different types of IV fluids to meet each patient's specific electrolyte needs at the time. And giving high-quality liquid nutrition to boost their levels of protein and other nutrients ""to help build back that immune system that was under attack."" Mehta and other experts were discussing Ebola at the American Society for Microbiology meeting Monday. Pharmaceutical companies are developing vaccines for Ebola and drugs to help treat the virus, but they're not fully tested or readily available yet. Dr. Gary Kobinger of the Public Health Agency of Canada helped pioneer the research that led to ZMapp, and he said the U.S. manufacturer appears to be on track for a Phase 1 safety study early next year, perhaps as early as January, although no drug is available currently. On the vaccine front, Kobinger said a Canadian-made candidate should be starting Phase 1 trials within weeks. WHO has suggested turning to the blood of Ebola survivors as an experimental treatment, and Sacra's doctors have said they are considering that.

"Al-Jazeera America will mark its first anniversary on the air next week despite averaging just 17,000 viewers a night. The news network has recorded low ratings since it first aired and recently had to layoff staff and cut some live newscasts. Al-Jazeera America has also won awards for its work, seen some recent audience growth and its chief executive insists a steady growth plan is on target. Al-Jazeera America will mark its first anniversary on the air next week despite averaging just 17,000 viewers . After several unsuccessful years trying to get its English-language network carried widely in the United States, the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera bought and closed Al Gore's Current TV network last year and set up the U.S.-focused AJAM to replace Al-Jazeera English in the U.S. It is now available in nearly 60 million cable and satellite homes, just over half the U.S. market. Dave Marash, a former reporter for ABC's Nightline and Al-Jazeera English, said: 'The quality of the channel is very much what was promised. 'It is serious of purpose, by far the best news channel available to American viewers.' Al-Jazeera America won Peabody Awards for documentaries on cholera in Haiti and a deadly factory fire in Bangladesh. The network had six first-place finishes in the National Headliner Awards, which honors notable journalism. Al Shihabi said he recognises online's importance but that Al-Jazeera is first a television network . Two weeks ago, the National Association of Black Journalists honored AJAM for 'creative, compelling, character-driven storytelling.' Aside from award judges, not many people have seen those stories. So far this year, Al-Jazeera America has averaged 17,000 viewers in prime time, ticking up to 23,000 during the first week of fighting in Gaza. CNN has averaged 453,000 and Fox News Channel 1.87 million in the same period, the Nielsen company said. Ehab Al Shihabi, AJAM's chief executive, considers that comparison unfair. The other news networks have been operating much longer, and are available in more homes. Their audiences were small at the start, if they even allowed Nielsen to measure them, he said. AJAM's first year should instead be judged on the quality of its journalism and growth in distribution, he said. 'Americans are not yet aware of Al-Jazeera America,' Al Shihabi said. 'We are, on a gradual basis, continuing our advertising, continuing our outreach. Awareness and perception will take time.' While the Israeli-Palestinian conflict gives the network a chance to showcase strength in international reporting, Al Shihabi said it also covers stories in the U.S. that its rivals don't. The prime-time newsmagazine America Tonight recently traveled to all 50 states for stories — reporting on gang violence in Alaska, a slow-moving project to sculpt the image of Crazy Horse on a South Dakota mountain and a woman in Detroit who makes coats for homeless people. Next month, director Alex Gibney delivers a new documentary on high school students' lives. Jon Klein, a former CNN U.S. president whose new startup just launched an online channel for Sarah Palin said: 'I do think there's a market for it. 'But to launch a cable channel in America today is a scary proposition because there is so much clutter in the marketplace. It is as much a marketing proposition as a content proposition.' He's not sure Al-Jazeera America has broken through with its message, saying people seem to be more aware of the news organisation Vice. Fox and MSNBC are more known for their points of view while CNN, which suffered through some of its worst ratings ever this spring, is beefing up its nonfiction, non-news programming. Marash believes buying Current was a mistake because Al-Jazeera English was having modest success streaming its channel online. Because of cable deals, live streaming has stopped. People have to search for AJAM on their channel lineups and sometimes can't even get a high-definition picture, he said. Al Shihabi said he recognises online's importance, but that Al-Jazeera is first a television network and TV is still a more lucrative business. From the start, critics said the name Al-Jazeera — conjuring memories of Bush administration criticism post-September 11 — is a off-putting in the U.S. Al-Jazeera is determined not to change it, not wanting to dilute its brand worldwide. AJAM laid off a few dozen journalists in April, and Al Shihabi recently told the staff that a smaller round of layoffs is coming. Some two and a half hours of live AJAM newscasts have been replaced by simulcasts of Al-Jazeera English programming, and staffers have been told to be mindful of travel expenses. Some wonder if the Qatar parent company's deep pockets have bottoms, and whether that reflects a lack of confidence in the American network. 'There is no rethinking here,' Al Shihabi said. 'I just need you to be aware that I also run a business. I had a budget for my launch, and I have a budget for the operation for years one and two and three.'","Al-Jazeera America will mark its first anniversary on the air next week .

"They are one of the deadliest creatures in the water but you wouldn't expect them to turn on their own.

"A CD of the sounds of silence from inside a village church has sold out after becoming an unlikely hit. The 30-minute recording was originally created to help raise some extra funds for repairs to St Peter's Church in Seaford, East Sussex. Church members believed the atmosphere in their small 12th century church was so unique that its peacefulness would appeal to a wider audience. Unlikely sell-out:  The Sound of Silence 30-minute CD recording from inside St Peter's Church has attracted buyers from as far afield as Ghana . So they left some recording equipment on inside the building for half-an-hour. The only sounds that can be heard on the CD are the odd squeaking of the wooden pews, some footsteps and the distant hum of passing traffic. After selling out of the CD during a recent open day the church has now taken orders for it from as far afield as Germany, Austria and Ghana. Roger Bing, 74, from Seaford, the church member who came up with the idea, said: 'The church was planning an open day and wanted something a little bit different to catch the attention of people who were coming along. 'The church has got quite good recording equipment so we decided to make a CD of 30 minutes of silence. 'It is pretty much silence throughout with a few background noises. 'There are a few little noises here and there - I think if it was total silence people might get a bit bored. Ancient times: Members of the congregation at the 12th century church in Seaford, East Sussex, are amazed the CD has become such a hit . 'So if you listen carefully you will hear some pews squeaking, footsteps and the distant hum of traffic going past outside. 'The people who have bought it say they have really enjoyed it. 'In this day and age everybody seems to live busier, noisier lives. 'People sometimes like to sit down and just have a bit of peace and quiet for a little while. 'This CD is great for that and people have mentioned it is very relaxing to listen to. 'It has also been used by people for meditation, which I think is splendid.' Dr Andrew Mayes, the Revd Canon of St Peter's Church, said: 'It is an 800-year-old sacred space with a wonderful quality of silence. 'We thought the idea of the peaceful silence you get inside the church could be something a little it different and I'm delighted it has proved so popular. 'At first there were one or two skeptical responses but in the end I think everybody agreed it was a very good idea.'",Orders for the 30-minute recording from inside the church have come from Germany and Ghana .
