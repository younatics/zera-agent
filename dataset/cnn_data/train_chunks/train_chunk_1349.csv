"A mystery customer has lifted the spirits of three Arizona-based restaurant workers after spending $420 on drinks and snacks - then leaving a staggering $11,000 worth of 'Tips for Jesus'. The unidentified man arrived at Crudo restaurant in Phoenix at 10pm on December 27 and shared a post-dinner snack and a round of drinks with a woman, according to one of the venue's partners. He then closed the tab, leaving a $1,000 tip on a $331.40 bill, before they both stayed for further drinks. When they later paid off the second $89.89 tab, the man added a huge $10,000 tip. A welcome surprise: A mystery customer has lifted the spirits of three Arizona-based restaurant workers after leaving around $11,000 worth of 'Tips for Jesus' two days after Christmas. Above, the tipper's receipts . Amazed: Bartender Clint Spotleson, one of the three servers who received the tips at Crudo restaurant in Phoenix, posted a photo of the bills to Instagram, saying: '@tipsforjesus hit @crudoaz again!!! Unbelievable!' Bartender Clint Spotleson, one of the three Crudo servers who received the tips, posted a photo of the bills to Instagram, writing: '@tipsforjesus hit @crudoaz again!!!!! Unbelievable!!!' On both of the receipts, the words, 'Tips for Jesus', were scrawled in pen by the customer. In this case, 'Tips for Jesus' is believed to refer to the anonymous person - or people - who regularly leave extravagant tips at restaurants and document their recipients' joy on an Instagram page. The page, which has more than 84,000 followers, features the slogan: 'Doing the Lord's work, one tip at a time.' It typically features restaurants in New York and Los Angeles, as well as Phoenix. Bartender: The unidentified customer arrived at the restaurant in Phoenix at 10pm on December 27 and shared a post-dinner snack and a round of drinks with a woman, it is said. Above, Mr Spotleson . Venue: He then closed the tab at the restaurant (pictured), leaving a $1,000 tip on a $331.40 bill, before they both stayed for further drinks. When they later paid off the second $89.89 tab, the man added a $10,000 tip . Speaking to AOL, Mr Spotleson said he, another bartender and a cocktail waitress shared the $11,000 combined tip, but also chose to give some of it to Crudo's kitchen staff. Describing his reaction to the customer's estimated 2,500-per-cent tip, he added: 'I dropped everything I had and just froze for second.... I had a bottle in my hand when he said it. 'It was a quick slip, but I caught it. The owner kind of gave me this look like, ""Oh, my gosh, wow!"".' Maureen Campbell, one of Crudo's partners, told ABC News that although the tipper wished to remain anonymous, he did stick around long enough to allow the restaurant workers to thank him. Generous: 'Tips for Jesus' is believed to refer to the anonymous person - or people - who regularly leave extravagant tips at restaurants and document their recipients' joy on a dedicated Instagram page (pictured) 'That's amazing!': Members of the public responded positively to the anonymous customer's generous tip . 'He did hand them the check before he left and they were very grateful for such a generous amount of money they received,' she said. 'I don’t know what his response was.' She added that the woman who had accompanied the man was believed by staff to be his date. The customer, who was using an American Express card, apparently left a tip at the same restaurant last year. However, it was for a lower - still, generous - amount of $2,500. Describing the tipper, Mr Spotleson said: 'He's a man ... He's in an age group where he's not old and rackety, but he's definitely got the ability to spend that kind of money.'","Unnamed man visited Crudo restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona, with woman .

"She spent years of 'heartache' and thousands of dollars on IVF in a desperate attempt to conceive. And in 2011, Angel Watts gave birth by a set of twins - followed by another set 16 months ago. Now, the devoted mother-of-four is taking to Facebook in a bid to help another couple to achieve their dream of having children - by advertising her six unused, donated embryos for adoption. However, she will not accept any willing parents-to-be -  they must adhere to a list of what some may perceive as unusual terms that she has posted on the social networking site. Mrs Watts, mother to Alexander and Shelby, aged three, and 16-month-old Angelina and Charles, says she wants the couple whom she chooses to be financially capable of supporting six children. Scroll down for video . Taking action: Angel Watts (pictured, far right, with her husband, Jeff, and two sets of twins, Alexander, Shelby, Angelina and Charles) is taking to Facebook to help another couple to achieve their dream of having children . They must also be in 'a steady, loving relationship' with 'a strong Christian background', good health (aside from infertility) and roots in Tennessee, where Miss Watts and her husband, Jeff, are from. Perhaps most strikingly, the chosen couple must raise any children together and allow the Wattses to have a relationship with their biological siblings - unlike many embryo donation arrangements. They should also not space the offspring too far apart in age - ideally, the majority of the embryos will be used over 'a six-year window', Mrs Watts, who lives with her family in Mount Juliet, says. In her long Facebook post in December, Mrs Watts, whose  embryos are in storage at the National Embryo Donation Center in Knoxville, said: 'We come with good news for someone out there. Strict guidelines: However, the mother-of-four (pictured)  will not accept any willing parents-to-be - they must adhere to a list of what some may perceive as unusual terms that she has posted on the social network site . Desires: Mrs Watts says she wants the couple whom she chooses to be financially capable of supporting six children. They must also be in 'a steady, loving relationship' with good health and roots in Tennessee . 'We are seeking a couple in the area who has roots in TN who is having issues with infertility who are otherwise healthy and will need IVF in order to start a family. - A couple that wants a large family and can afford to have six children . - They will ideally be in 'a steady, loving relationship' and have 'a strong Christian background' - They must have roots in Tennessee . - Aside from issues with infertility, they should otherwise be healthy . - 'No super age gap' between the siblings - ideally, most embryos will be used over 'a six-year window' - They must be 35 years old or younger 'in order to set the process up for the best odds of success' 'We have 6 good quality frozen six-day-old embryos to donate to an amazing family who wants a large family. ... It would be very nice if there is no super huge age gap between the siblings.' Speaking to USA Today, Mrs Watts said she decided to advertise her extra embryos - initially donated by a 20-year-old woman - after reading stories of ill-fated donor-conceived children. Some of these children felt disregarded - by science and donor anonymity - from any chance of knowing anything about where they came from, she said. In relation to her own children, she added: 'Sometimes, when they are playing together and doing their own thing, absorbed in their own little world, I feel like I could just watch them forever. 'I feel like I don't even need to watch television, that I could just watch them all the time.' Doctor and lawyer Ellen Wright Clayton, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told the news site that some of Mrs Watts's terms were backed by scientific evidence. She explained how the desires of donor-conceived children are not entirely different from those of adopted children. Family: Speaking to USA Today, Mrs Watts (pictured with her family) said she decided to advertise her extra embryos - initially donated by a 20-year-old woman - after reading stories of ill-fated donor-conceived children . Further rules: Perhaps most strikingly, the chosen couple must raise any children together and allow the Wattses to have a relationship with their biological siblings - unlike many embryo donation arrangements . Mrs Watts said: 'We are seeking open communication and meetings so siblings grow up to know each other' 'There's tons of evidence to show that many, many people who are raised in families that weren't the ones who bore them want to know where they came from,' she said. She added that there appeared to be nothing legally wrong about Mrs Watts donating the embryos. Although the Wattses have received numerous responses to their Facebook post, they are yet to find a match. Mrs Watts, 45, cannot carry the additional 'good quality' embryos herself due to her age and health.","Angel Watts, 45, spent thousands of dollars on IVF in a bid to conceive .

"Tasteless: Neil Phillips, 44, insists he meant 'no harm' when he posted the jokes online .

"When George and Merle Orris finally finished renovating their house in London 27 years ago, moving was the last thing on their minds. But as they leafed through the pages of a magazine, they saw a photograph of The Old Tower in the Hertfordshire village of Benington – and were immediately smitten. ‘It was a slightly ridiculous situation,’ recalls Merle. ‘We had just finished doing up our lovely house and we had a successful clothing business in town. 'But we fell in love with the tower, and realised that as it was just a 25-minute journey from nearby Stevenage to King’s Cross, it was a simple commute.’ George and Merle Orris have put their fairytale 'Rapunzel' tower on the market for £1.35million . The property certainly makes a memorable first impression. Five storeys high and covered in ivy, it’s reminiscent of the tower in the fairy tale Rapunzel. And even without actually setting foot inside the Victorian home, you can see its appeal. Built in about 1890, it was constructed as a water tower, which seems rather prosaic a use for such a magical dwelling. It is one of five houses on a private estate. Although the four others are close by – a couple can be spotted through the trees in the garden – the surroundings are incredibly peaceful. The Old Tower was converted in about 1980, and the Orrises, who are in their late 50s and have no children, have done a great deal of further work in their time there. They converted the Old Tower in 1980 and each room is like a jewel – individual and with dainty touches . Five storeys high and covered in ivy, it’s reminiscent of the tower in the fairy tale Rapunzel and even boasts a rooftop terrace . Each room is like a jewel – individual and with dainty touches – with the overwhelming feel of a five-star Far Eastern hotel. ‘We have travelled a great deal,’ says Merle. ‘Our love of the Far East is reflected in the house.’ To the left of the high entrance hall is a bright dining room, with double doors leading out to the garden, and a large but elegant ceramic and metal Swedish log stove in the corner which reaches from floor to ceiling. Price: £1.35million . Location: Benington, Hertfordshire . Bedrooms: Four . Unique features: Victorian water tower on a private estate, rooftop terrace, Swedish log stove, good commuter links . ‘It throws out enough heat to warm the whole of the ground floor,’ says George. A flight of stairs takes you to a cosy but light mezzanine sitting room, and at the back of the dining room is a large wine cellar and storage room, which used to be a coal store. The kitchen is on the ground floor of the tower and leads to a small study which has windows on three sides, as well as a glass roof. ‘It used to be a very pretty breakfast room,’ says Merle, with a slight feeling of resignation. ‘But George wanted it as a study.’ Although the kitchen is very pretty, the magic of the house is unquestionably in the upper storeys. Looking up the tower’s winding staircase, you can see that each of the 100 steps is meticulously carpeted. ‘We’ve just had the carpet put in,’ Merle explains. ‘It took months, but it means that the stairs aren’t remotely slippery.’ The first-floor bedroom – currently a spare room – has an en suite bathroom and a balcony overlooking the back garden. ‘The walls are very thick, so all the rooms stay warm, no matter how chilly it is outside,’ Merle says. Built in about 1890, it was constructed as a water tower, which seems rather prosaic a use for such a magical dwelling . It is one of five houses on a private estate in Hertfordshire, but the surroundings are incredibly peaceful . The second-floor bedroom is the master bedroom, again with an en suite. Double-aspect windows overlook the front garden and fields beyond. There are two further bedrooms on the subsequent floors, though Merle uses the top one as a dressing room, and two round windows hung with exotic fabric give it the feeling of a sitting room. ‘It’s a lovely place to sit and read if you want to get away from everything,’ she says. All the ceilings are surprisingly high, making the rooms feel larger. A roof-level door leads to a wooden terrace covering the top of the tower. The views are sublime – you can see for miles across the Hertfordshire countryside, as well as admire the property’s large front lawn and neighbouring paddock. The Orrises have enjoyed sitting out on the terrace with a glass of wine on many summer evenings. There are excellent local schools nearby and Hertford is just eight miles away, with a decent array of restaurants and shops. The couple are now selling up – the property is on the market for £1.35 million – and are planning to retire to France. ‘We’ll be sad to leave. But we’re going to go and live by the sea, and perhaps we’ll buy a vineyard,’ says Merle.

"It had seemed like perhaps the world's most disastrous marriage proposal. Thousands watched what appeared at first glance to be mobile phone footage of a hapless romeo asking for his girlfriend's hand in marriage, only to be clumped around the head with a busker's ukulele. But it appears that tens of thousands of YouTube viewers have been duped - the video is in fact a clever piece of marketing by Cadbury. Scroll down for video . I most certainly won't: The moment the man's public marriage proposal goes disastrously wrong when his would-be bride clumps him round the head with a ukulele - but it's all a clever marketing campaign for Cadbury . The cringeworthy footage, thought to . have been shot in a shopping mall in Dubai, went viral after it was . posted onto the video sharing website attracting hundreds of comments, . with some concerned viewers even addressing the jilted man. But the hilarious clip is actually part of confectioner Cadbury's new Not So Sweet advertising campaign aimed at young adults who prefer dark chocolate that's not so sweet. The clip shows the man, described as an 'Indian teen', and the girl walk up to a group of buskers in the shopping centre. As the musicians begin to play he takes a microphone and launches into a gooey speech saying: 'I have a very special message for a very special girl. This is where we met three months ago. 'You are my charm, you are my sweety pie, you are my cutie pie, my absolute everything, and I know you find this cheesy but I want everyone to know, you make me really happy.' As a crowd gathers things start going badly for the man when a toy town-style mall train drives past, breaking the mood and the embarrassed girl mutters 'Oh my god everyone's watching.' As MailOnline reported, there was a strong suggestion that the video could be a stunt - the train has a Cadbury Bournville logo emblazoned along its side and the 'Not So Sweet' slogan. Here goes: The man, backed by a group of buskers, begins his proposal speech in a Dubai shopping mall . Popping the question: He drops down on one knee to ask the girl to be his bride as she begs him to stop . Blam: The furious girl swings the busker's miniature guitar catching the unwanted suitor around the head . Undaunted the man continues: 'I have a little poem for you and I want everyone to hear this. 'When you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while. And my heart ceases to beat and there is nothing else I seek except you.' As he gets down on one knee the girl begs him to stop but he continues: 'And I Just have one question for you. You truly make me that happiest person on earth.' Love hurts: The man lies in a crumpled heap on the ground before the girl storms off . But the girl simply cannot take anymore and she snatches the miniature guitar out of the hands of one of the buskers and whacks her suitor round the head with it sending him to the floor in a crumpled heap. She then throws the instrument onto the ground and and storms off. The Cadbury 'Not So Sweet' campaign has focused on social media and includes a Twitter campaign called Tape a Tweet. It encourages Twitter users to tweet a situation that is overly sweet which the company then turns into a short video.

"A cargo ship found overturned off the Scottish coast has sunk below the water's surface as coastguard rescue teams continue searching for the eight missing crew members feared dead. While lifeboats involved in the search effort have been stood down, air and coastal searches are continuing. The operation was mounted after the upturned hull of the Cypriot-registered Cemfjord was spotted in the waters of the Pentland Firth, north of Scotland. This afternoon a spokeswoman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said the vessel was no longer visible after having submerged below the water's surface. Scroll down for video . A major air and sea rescue operation was mounted after the overturned hull, above, was spotted yesterday . The search operation was called off last night after dark. A tug boat remained behind to illuminate the scene . But she said 'sadly' there had not been any sign of the missing crew, made up of seven Poles and one Filipino. Two helicopters, four lifeboats and five coastguard rescue teams had this morning resumed the search for the eight people who were on Cemfjord. A spokesperson for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said 'every effort' was being made to find them. The search was sparked after the crew of a passenger ferry raised the alarm when they spotted the upturned hull of the vessel in the Pentland Firth, north of Scotland. After darkness fell last night it was called off, although passing vessels were asked to scan the area. The MCA spokesperson said: 'The search has resumed this morning, with two helicopters, four lifeboats and five coastguard rescue teams. There is no sign of any of the crewmen. 'It is early in the day so we will see how the day progresses, but every effort is under way.' German shipping company Brise of Hamburg confirmed yesterday that there were eight people on the ship, seven Poles and one Filipino, adding that there had been no distress call. The Cemfjord was drifting at 5.2 knots, roughly 6 mph, according to readings recorded yesterday . The RNLI searched a large area of ocean, marked in blue, looking for survivors from the sinking vessel . The 83-metre bulk cement carrier had been bound for Runcorn, Cheshire, on the west coast of Britain. Shetland Coastguard was alerted by the NorthLink ferry Hrossey which spotted the vessel around 10 miles east of the Pentland Skerries, about 15 miles from Wick. Passenger Caitlin Ditchfield told the BBC: 'After a while the captain made an announcement that he had called the three closest coastguards but they had asked that the ferry conduct a search while the lifeboats made their way to us. 'The ferry started to circle the ship looking for any debris. We were at the scene for two-and-a-half hours before the coastguards said we could carry on with our journey.' The Cypriot-registered Cemfjord, a cargo ship carrying cement, pictured, was last seen Friday afternoon . She said it had been a rough crossing but conditions were decent when they spotted the overturned vessel. A spokesman for Brise of Hamburg said yesterday that the 'crew of eight are missing following a severe accident in the Pentland Firth, off the north of Scotland on Friday January 2'. The statement said: 'The crew consists of seven Polish seafarers and one Filipino mariner. The company is in the process of informing the families.' An MCA statement said: 'The search has begun again this morning for eight crew missing from the cement carrier Cemfjord, which capsized and sank in the Pentland Firth. 'The two helicopters and four lifeboats have resumed their search and will be joined by coastguard rescue teams from Kirkwall, St Margaret's Hope, Duncansby, Scrabster and Wick. HMS Somerset and her helicopter have also joined the search. The crew of Northlink ferry Hrossey, pictured, reported that there were no survivors in the immediate area . 'The search has been ongoing since 2.30pm yesterday afternoon when the vessel was found capsized by a passing ferry. Sadly no sign has yet been found of the missing crew.' Last night a spokesman for the MCA said it 'was not looking particularly encouraging' that the crew would be found. The search last night was co-ordinated by Shetland coastguards. Four RNLI lifeboats from Wick, Thurso, Longhope and Stromness were sent to the area. The coastguard rescue helicopter from Shetland and an RAF rescue helicopter were also scrambled. As darkness fell, other vessels in the area joined in the hunt. A Maltese registered tug, the Herakles, remained on station last night illuminating the area and warning other shipping about the danger posed by the semi-submerged cargo ship. The Cemfjord was drifting at 5.2 knots, roughly 6 mph, according to readings on marinetraffic.com that were recorded yesterday. It left port in Aalborg, Denmark on December 30. The Pentland Firth is a channel between the north tip of Scotland and Orkney that is known for strong tides and requires careful planning to sail, according to Sail North Scotland.

"An Ohio woman who had her children help her shoplift from a Wal-Mart has been ordered to write them a letter explaining what she did and why it was wrong. Police in Logan in southeastern Ohio say Hallie Thomas and her two daughters took merchandise from a Wal-Mart last February and March. The Logan Daily News reports the 36-year-old Thomas pleaded guilty on Tuesday to one count of petty theft and one count of child endangering. Shoplifted: Police in Logan in southeastern Ohio say Hallie Thomas and her two daughters took merchandise from this Wal-Mart last February and March . Hocking County Municipal Court Judge Fred Moses ordered Thomas to write the letter explaining why what she did was wrong and said he hoped she learned from her experience. The judge also sentenced her to 10 days in jail, fined her and ordered her to stay away from Wal-Mart. Defense attorney Don Kline said Thomas accepted responsibility and was remorseful. Thomas and her daughters were caught shoplifting on video on February 17. Surveillance revealed that Thomas’ daughters entered Walmart with their mother wearing dark-colored coats, and left wearing pink coats and had hidden stolen items under their coats, reports The Logan Daily. Hocking County Municipal Court Judge Fred Moses was most troubled by the fact that Logan included her daughters in the crime. 'I hope you learn from this,' stated Moses. 'You really need help. While in the community corrections program, make sure you learn from this and that you cannot involve your children.'

"Megan Hoffner, pictured, claims she has been left £60,000 in debt, stands on the brink of losing her home and is embroiled in a legal fight . Millionaire businessmen Barrie and Tony Drewitt-Barlow present themselves as the poster boys of British surrogate parenting. But for one surrogate the decision to work with their British Surrogacy Centre (BSC) has proved to be disastrous. The Drewitt-Barlows were the first gay couple named on a surrogate baby’s birth certificate and went on to have four more children, set up their surrogacy agency and star in reality show The Parent Makers. But 5,000 miles away in San Diego, Megan Hoffner claims she has been left £60,000 in debt, stands on the brink of losing her home and is embroiled in a legal fight which has taken her to the edge of financial ruin. It is a complicated tale mired in claim and counter-claim from which no one emerges unscathed. ‘This whole process has been a disaster,’ she says. ‘The low point for me was going into hospital for an emergency Caesarean section and waking up to find nobody would tell me if the twins I was carrying were alive or dead. I still have nightmares and anxiety attacks to this day.’ Megan, a 35-year-old mother of two, had successfully been a surrogate to twin girls for a Spanish family when, at the end of 2013, she decided to become a surrogate again. She said: ‘I wanted to bring the joy of children to a family who might not otherwise experience that happiness. You get paid to be a surrogate, but this was never about making money.’ She added: ‘The British Surrogacy Centre leapt out at me. Barrie and Tony sounded like remarkable men. I got in touch with their local office in LA. I thought I was in for another magical journey. Instead it turned into the worst experience of my life.’ At first, Megan says, all went well. She signed a 24-page surrogacy agreement on November 21 2013 in which she agreed to bear a child (or multiple children) for Marco Aurelio Lucas and Roberto De Souza Silva. Megan is coldly referred to as ‘Carrier’ throughout. The document says Megan will be paid £22,500 for one child – with childcare, lost wages, medical bills and ‘extra baby’ clauses built in – and an extra £5,000 for twins. My Weird And Wonderful Family: Tony and Barrie Drewitt-Barlow, the gay Essex couple hold a pair of long-distance twins Dallas and Jasper they were the first gay couple named on a surrogate baby’s birth certificate . She also agrees to give up all parental rights to the children. The document says Megan will be tested for sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. She agrees not to smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs and the document coldly discusses what will happen if the child is born with life-threatening illness: ‘The Carrier shall have no input. The decision to utilize life-sustaining treatment…for the child shall be made by the Intended Parents.’ Megan, who works as a personal assistant for her father, a legal adviser for US Army veterans, says there were money problems from the start. ‘At my first appointment they told me I was carrying twins. I was very sick so the doctor ordered me to take total bed rest. I couldn’t work. The bills started piling up.’ She claims the BSC failed to provide a translator, making it difficult for her to correspond with the Portuguese-speaking ‘intended parents’ in Brazil, adding: ‘I tried to do everything through the BSC, but they were grossly incompetent.’ Megan explained: ‘I kept submitting bills for expenses and the payments would be late. The BSC told me there were issues in Brazil and that because surrogacy was illegal in Brazil they’d had their bank account flagged up. I emailed Barrie Drewitt-Barlow at the end of last year, begging him to help to get my bills paid. In return he sent me emails full of abuse.’ Tony and Barrie Drewitt-Barlow have featured in a number of television shows, including Channel 4's My Weird And Wonderful Family and The Drewitt-Barlow's on Sky 192 . In one email Drewitt-Barlow, who lives in a sprawling Essex mansion, purportedly wrote: ‘I advised your Ips (Intended Parents) NOT to pay you anything at all because you are a crazy bitch who deserves to be locked up! Your Ips will not be paying you one more penny! I am so happy that they ran from you!’ Another says: ‘U should be ashamed of urself you utterly selfish cow! You are just trailer trash woman and I want nothing more to do with u! I will dig up all ur dirt including all the lawyers u p****d off on this case! You will not get one more penny, let’s face it ur contract will not stand up in any court in Brazil! Lol.’ Barrie Drewitt-Barlow last night claimed the emails shown to The Mail on Sunday by Megan had been doctored – something she vehemently denies. But she admits she’s made mistakes, including an angry email exchange with the Brazilians. ‘I sent some hateful emails to the Brazilian couple which I deeply regret. 'I asked them if they really wanted these babies. They interpreted that as me threatening to abort the twins. I would never do that. 'But I told them, if they didn’t want these children, I would have to place them up for adoption.’ Proud fathers Barrie Drewitt and Tony Barlow with their children Saffron and Aspen Drewitt-Barlow after another of their surrogate mothers, Rosalind Bellamy delivered them . Megan says she bears no ill-will towards the Brazilians, who moved to San Diego for the birth. They take a less charitable view of Megan, saying she was unreliable and unsuitable to be a surrogate. But there is one thing that they all agree upon – the BSC did a poor job, a point made by their lawyer in court documents. Megan went into labour on 30 August last year: ‘I was doubled over in pain and rushed to the nearest hospital. I was heavily sedated. When I woke up the babies were gone and nobody would tell me if they were alive or dead as I had signed over my rights.’ Megan never saw the twins and was forced to go to court to try to get her outstanding bills paid. A Californian judge ordered £16,000 to be placed in a bond for her, which she claims the Brazilians failed to pay – choosing instead to leave the country. Barrie and Tony with Saffron, Aspen and Orlando . Megan went on to say: ‘I blame BSC for all the problems. The Brazilians didn’t realise that the costs could escalate as they did.’ Last night Reece Statham, vice-president of the BSC, said: 'The majority of the money Megan claims is owed is medical fees incurred because she insisted on using a hospital not covered by her medical insurance. She was advised of this but refused to change.’ Megan claims that she used an ineligible hospital because she needed an emergency delivery. Curiously, the BSC denies having any responsibility for administering the contract or even creating it, saying it was negotiated through both sides’ legal representatives. Barrie Drewitt-Barlow told The Mail on Sunday that Megan had been extremely difficult to deal with and that her lifestyle meant she was not suitable as a surrogate. ‘She actually is as mad as a hatter,’ he said. Which rather begs the question – why was she chosen to be a surrogate in the first place?","Drewitt-Barlows were first gay couple on surrogate baby’s birth certificate .

"Experts fear Britain could soon be in the grip of a new heroin crisis after figures showed prescriptions of a highly addictive opioid painkiller have soared in recent years. Oxycodone was prescribed more than a million times in England last year, an increase of 39 per cent since 2010. The drug is known in the US as 'hillbilly heroin' or 'poor man's heroin' because of its abuse in rural areas since the brand was first sold there in 1996. Scroll down for video . Oxycodone was prescribed more than a million times in England last year, a rise of 39 per cent since 2010 . 2009/2010 - 788,607 . 2010/2011 - 919,177 . 2011/2012 - 1.01million . 2012/2013 - 1.09million . Oxycodone is a synthetic form of morphine, but is twice as strong, and is usually prescribed to people in the late stages of cancer, after surgery or for chronic pain. Tablets became available in the UK in 2001. As well as relieving pain, it induces feelings of euphoria, relaxation and helps people sleep. Experts say people then switch to heroin because it is easier and cheaper to buy. This could see people turn to the drug, which has declined sharply in use in recent years. Deaths from heroin in England and Wales have fallen sharply, peaking at 981 in 2001 and had fallen to 596 in 2011. It has been shunned by younger people in favour of cocaine and Ecstasy. Peaches Geldof, who died of a heroin overdoes last April aged 25, was considered unusually young to be using the drug. But health professionals in the US have blamed the rise of oxycodone prescriptions for greater heroin use and it is feared the same could happen in the UK. The number of deaths in the US from heroin overdoses went up from 1,779 in 2010 to 3,665 in 2012. Often addicts use both heroin and oxycodone. The Hollywood actor Philip Seymour Hoffman died after relapsing into oxycodone and heroin abuse. Peter Shmulin, the governor of Vermont, blamed the drug - sold as Oxycontin in the US - for creating a 'crisis' in his state. 'What started as an Oxycontin and prescription drug addiction problem in Vermont has now grown in to a full blown heroin crisis.' The Hollywood actor Philip Seymour Hoffman died after relapsing into oxycodone and heroin abuse . Experts fear people becoming addicted to the drug and then switching to heroin because it is cheaper to buy . The figures were compiled by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) think-tank, from Department of Health data. Rupert Oldham-Reid, a senior researcher, said oxycodone does have legitimate medical use but the sharp rise in prescriptions should be examined closely. He told the Times: 'These numbers show a dramatic rise in prescriptions of oxycodone. It is right that we ask why this is happening and what the effects may be. 'Oxycodone and other prescription drugs play an important medical role, but we have to make sure we don’t over-prescribe and risk facing the problems they now see in America.' The CSJ is calling for prescription numbers for each GP practice to be made available and for more frequent reviews of repeat prescriptions.","Prescriptions of addictive painkiller oxycodone soared in recent years .

"An Illinois couple has turned their old horse barn into a six-acre dream home equipped with a gym, a pizza kitchen, a projection screen, and a fitness center. Jeff and Lisa Edwards built a pole-barn for two horses and a colt, according to the Washington Times, but the family had so much fun visiting and staying in the family quarters that they decided there was only one thing to do: live there. Six years ago, the five-member family packed up and moved to the horse barn just three miles from Arcola, but not before making some much-needed renovations and additions. The family gave the horses away because caring for them was too demanding and took time from family and other business, Lisa said. Family: For the past six years, the Edwards family (photographed) has been living in a horse barn turned dream home . Quarters: Lisa and Jeff Edwards (photographed) decided to transform the pole-barn after spending weekends and a summer in the barn's family quarters . Children: The couple has three children (left to right) Taylor, Beau, and Cara . What used to be the birthing room of the barn is now the Edwards' main kitchen, according to The News-Gazette. The Edwards' transformed the stalls into a living room and guest room. The master loft bedroom used to be the hay loft. Jeff, acting as a general contractor, built two fire places in the 5,000-square-foot home that both burn wood. 'We don't have any gas out here. It's all electric,' Lisa said. 'We dug the pond and under it is our geo-thermal heating and cooling system. It's more energy-efficient. Of the 5,000 square feet, 3,000 square feet of it is occupied by a full gymnasium. According to The Republic, the Edwards family is really into sports and the family even lets the Arcola Grade School's basketball, softball, and baseball teams practice in the gym when the school's is occupied. Square Feet & Six Acres: The home is 5,000 square feet, and stands on six acres just 3 miles from Arcola . Fire Place: Jeff built the fire place (left) as well as another in the home, both burn wood . The gymnasium also boasts a batting cage, a pizza kitchen, and a fitness center. The Times reports that the Edwards' used the kitchen to entertain more than 30 relatives who came to the massive house for Thanksgiving. The couple hired someone to build the shell of the house and Jeff, along with a carpenter, finished the massive home, with the exception of heating, air-conditioning, and plumbing. The couple's oldest daughter, Cara, attends college and her younger sister, Taylor, is a senior in high school. Their youngest, Beau, is in the fifth grade, according to The Republican. Gymnasium: Of the 5,000 square feet of the home, 3,000 square feet of it is occupied by a full gymnasium . The Essentials: The gymnasium boasts a batting cage (photographed), a fitness center, and a pizza kitchen . In the gymnasium, there is a large projection screen mounted on one wall  with large speakers on each side where the family can have a movie-theatre-like experience. Before moving into their dream home, the Edwards lived in a funeral home, renovated by Jeff, that the couple owned, according to the Gazette. They lived on the top floor of the home until they moved into the massive house. 'We kind of outgrew the funeral home, living upstairs,' Lisa said. 'We were able to keep the girls quiet during visitations. But Beau still liked to run from one end to the other so we decided Beau would like to run here.","Jeff and Lisa Edwards, of Illinois, turned their old horse barn into a six-acre dream home equipped with a gym, a pizza kitchen, a projection screen, and a fitness center .

"TV host and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee says he is leaving his Fox News talk show as he considers whether to seek the Republican nomination for president, a decision he expects to reach in the spring. Huckabee said Saturday night's edition of 'Huckabee' would be his last as he ponders his political future. The weekly show, which is taped with a live audience and features political commentary as well as interviews with guests and musical entertainment, has been on the air for more than six years. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Leaving Fox: Former Arkansas Governer Mike Huckabee says he is ending his six-year run as a TV host on Fox News in the event he may decide to run for president . 'There's been a great deal of speculation as to whether I would run for president. And if I were willing to absolutely rule that out, I could keep doing this show. But I can't make such a declaration,' he said at the end of Saturday's program. 'Now, I'm not going to make a decision about running until late in the spring of 2015, but the continued chatter has put Fox News into a position that just isn't fair to them — nor is it possible for me to openly determine political and financial support to justify a race. The honorable thing to do at this point is to end my tenure here at Fox. Now, as much as I have loved doing the show, I cannot bring myself to rule out another presidential run.' The former Baptist preacher and Arkansas chief executive — he led the state from 1996 to 2007 — is a favorite among social conservatives. Announced his goodbye: 'The honorable thing to do at this point is to end my tenure here at Fox. Now, as much as I have loved doing the show, I cannot bring myself to rule out another presidential run,' he said . While hosting the TV show he has published books, appeared at conservative conferences around the country and offered harsh criticism of President Barack Obama's policies. Huckabee has been particularly critical of the nation's swing toward accepting gay marriage. In October, after the Supreme Court rejected appeals from five states that sought to prohibit marriage by same-sex couples, he said: 'It is shocking that many elected officials, attorneys and judges think that a court ruling is the 'final word.' It most certainly is not.' He campaigned last fall for several Republican office-seekers — among them Senate candidates Joni Ernst in Iowa, David Perdue in Georgia, Tom Cotton in Arkansas and Mike Rounds in South Dakota. Rounds was national chairman of Huckabee's 2008 presidential campaign. Huckabee, 59, won the Iowa caucuses in 2008, finishing ahead of Mitt Romney, Fred Thompson, John McCain and Ron Paul. He came in third, however, in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary, behind McCain and Romney. McCain emerged as the leader in the primaries that followed and Huckabee ended his campaign that March.","TV host and former Republican  Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee says he is leaving Fox News to decide if he wants to run for president .

"In the end, Kathy Taylor was in so much pain that she couldn't sleep, she couldn't walk, she couldn't breathe. The Utah mother-of-five had refused treatment for her terminal cancer while 26 weeks pregnant for fear of hurting her unborn son.The boy, Luke, came into the world in September, about 14 weeks too soon, and was gone two weeks later from an infection. Yet in her darkest hour, Kathy didn't pray for life or health. The 34-year-old mother asked only for her family to be comforted, for her final days to be peaceful, and for courage to face the tragic road ahead. Kathy Taylor, pictured with two of her five kids, refused cancer treatment to avoid hurting her sixth child, with whom she was 26 weeks pregnant. The baby, Luke, was born 14 weeks premature but died two weeks later . Kathy Taylor passed away on New Year's Eve. In her prayers, the selfless mother asked only for comfort for her husband Nathan (pictured) and five children . 'I have to admit it has been extremely hard and I pray constantly for strength to endure cheerfully, to be able to continue to be kind and nurturing to my family till the end and I’ve been praying to not be afraid of what the end will look like,' Kathy wrote on her online journal, Kathy's Miracle, just days before she passed away on New Year's Eve. 'I pray to die peacefully without pain but don’t know if that will be granted so I’m hoping Christ continues to sustain me and keep me from having fear and anxiety,' she added. In her final week, Kathy could barely stand for more than five minutes at a time. The pain in her liver became so intense, she moaned through the night while sleeping upright, the only position that mildly alleviated her suffering. All she wanted was to hang on until Christmas, hoping her five kids and husband could remember one last holiday with her. 'I pray for my husband to be comforted,' Kathy wrote. 'I know this is hard for him. I still trust that God is completely aware and that everything will happen as it should. 'I will be grateful to be out of pain and with Heavenly Father and Jesus and hope to be able to offer lots of comfort to my family from the other side,' she wrote. 'I am so grateful they have so many wonderful people to turn to.' Kathy was a devoted mother who gave everything for her children. In her final act of selfless love, she sacrificed her own chance of surviving cancer so she wouldn't terminate her sixth pregnancy during treatment . Kathy died at home on December 31. She had been diagnosed with melanoma in late August, when she was pregnant with her sixth child, Luke. As the cancer spread throughout her body, Kathy refused treatment for fear of hurting her baby. Because of the cancer, she was forced to give birth shortly after the diagnosis. Luke was born in September 11, 14 weeks premature. He died two weeks later. National Attention: Kathy's story drew national attention, even singer Sarah McLachlan donated proceeds of a song Taylor covered to help with medical costs . Nathan described how he and his wife's parents discovered she had passed away. He said he fainted when he learned the news. 'As I realized [Kathy] had gone, I gathered her in my arms and embraced her. I could not believe it,' Nathan wrote. 'I was so sad that I had been asleep and not been with her when she passed. I was so sad it was already goodbye.' Kathy defied the odds. When she was diagnosed with the dangerous skin cancer while carrying her sixth child, Luke Taylor, doctors gave her only days, then weeks, to live. Refused Treatment: Kathy refused treatment while she was pregnant for fear of hurting her unborn son . Kathy pushed through for months, exceeding doctor's expectations. When her liver began to fail, Kathy was forced to deliver baby Luke on September 11. A post on the blog, chronicling the woman's journey, details Kathy's amazing sacrifice. The post reads: 'With an inability to save herself, Kathy is devoting her strength to giving birth to the little one inside…one last act of selfless love.' Defied Expectations: Kathy defied doctor's expectations, holding on for weeks then months with the deadly skin cancer . The mother prolonged the delivery as long as she possibly could. Baby Luke was born weighing only 1 pound and 15 ounces, doctors whisked him to the neonatal intensive care unit at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and gave Kathy about a day to live. Against doctor's expectations, Kathy got to hold and embrace her infant son, who died on Sept. 27. The woman held on through her son's birth, her eldest child's birthday on Sept. 14, and her own birthday on Dec. 10. Kathy was diagnosed with melanoma while she was pregnant with her sixth child, Luke (right), who was born prematurely and later died of an infection. Oon the left, Kathy is seen with husband Nathan . In a post on the Nathan and Kathy Taylor Charitable Account, where condolences have poured in from those who knew Kathy or just knew her story, Nathan wrote that New Year's Eve will be a celebration of Kathy's life.

A lesson learned: Sixth-grade teacher, Melissa Bour, decided to teach her students a lesson about the dangers of posting risque photos online by writing this letter (pictured) and posting an image of it online . And although Miss Bour later deleted the original post, copies of it remain online - proving another lesson for students that just because you delete an image, it is not totally erased from the internet. In the letter, the teacher wrote: 'Dear Facebook, I am a 6th grade teacher in Oklahoma. My 12 year old students think it is 'no big deal' that they are posting pictures of themselves in bras or with their middle fingers in the air. 'Please help me out by sharing this image and commenting with where you live to show these young students how quickly their images can get around. Thanks! Miss Bour.' Speaking to Fox 23, Miss Bour said she decided to write the letter and share it online in early December after receiving a Facebook friend request from one of her sixth-grade students. Success: Miss Bour (pictured) asked her friends to share the letter, written in caps and addressed to 'Dear Facebook', online. Within hours, it had gone viral, appearing in nearly every state, as well as other countries . School: Miss Bour is a science and math teacher at Emerson Elementary School (above) in Tulsa, Oklahoma . Although she did not accept the request, she was able to browse the student's friend list and noticed that a high number of her pupils were posting selfies to the social-networking site. In many of these, the students were donning skimpy clothing or swearing at the camera, she said. After failing to verbally convince her class to stop posting such images, she took to Facebook to get her point across and prevent her students from enduring undesirable consequences in later life. 'I had students respond with ""It’s no big deal"" and ""nobody really cares"", and I care. I care very much about their reputations,' Miss Bour said. Teacher: Although Miss Bour (pictured, left, on Facebook) later deleted the post, copies of it remain online - proving another lesson for students. Right, a copy of the later is now displayed in the teacher's classroom . 'My generation was the one that kind of made Facebook big, and we have a tendency to overshare. These students are just falling into that. 'You have to remind them that just because everyone else is sharing doesn’t mean you have to.' She added that Tulsa Public Schools curriculum allowed her to make the post because the district supports teaching youngsters how to be a good digital citizen, CNN reported. Both students and parents alike have reacted positively to Miss Bour's social media lesson - with one student, Peyton Piguet, telling Today: 'I'm not going to put any more photos on my Facebook.' Xavier Ingram added: ' Say I want to be the president. That might affect me becoming president.'","Melissa Bour was alarmed after seeing students' selfies on Facebook .

"A transgender army veteran made history as she became the first senior to have sex reassignment surgery under Medicare. Denee Mallon, 75,  of Albuquerque, New Mexico waged a long and difficult battle against the government insurance program, and claimed victory when a U.S. health and human services board ruled back in May that Medicare could no longer deny the service, which they deemed medically necessary for transgender individuals. And now, Mallon says she finally 'feels complete'  following the procedure. Scroll down for video . History: Denee Mallon, a 75-year-old army veteran, became the first person to have sex reassignemnt surgery under Medicare . Long battle: Mallon has waited decades to undergo the surgery, living as a woman since the age of 40 . 'I feel congruent, like I'm finally one complete human being where my body matches my innermost feelings, my psyche,' Mallon told NBC News. 'It's taken me all these years and detours, potholes and whatnot to finally be where I am right now.' Medicare decided to ban the surgery in 1989, saying it was 'experimental,' and noting a 'lack of well controlled, long-term studies of the safety and effectiveness of the surgical procedures and attendant therapies.' Back then, Mallon was not yet eligible for the government program, but she faced her own problems when her doctors refused to approve the surgery, largely because Mallon was still having sex with women. 'I have a difficult time relating to somebody what it feels like to be me,' explained Mallon. 'One of the obvious things people will say is, ""It's a lifestyle choice. You've made this choice."" Well, it's far deeper than that. It's so a part of my basic psyche, there's no escaping it.' Mallon, who has been married three times and has five children, says she realized she was different when she just 5-years-old, and that all of her wives have been aware of her identity. Those women tried to change her, but it never took says Mallon. Inspiring: 'I finally feel complete,' said Mallon after the operation . Steps forward: Some believe this may make it easier for other transgender persons to get the surgery approved by their insurance providers . As for her family, she says it was just her strict and very conservative father who accepted her gender identity, and that none of her siblings supported her, labeling her a 'weirdo.' In fact, until 2012 Mallon, lived what is referred to in the community as the 'stealth life,' never revealing she was transgender. That all changed in 2012 however, when she decided to become an activist and take on Medicare - after 30 years trying to get approval for her surgery. It was a daunting task and one that had never been tried before, but in the end, Mallon was able to claim victory not just for herself, but for all transgender persons. The HHS board said in their ruling; 'We have no difficulty concluding that the new evidence, which includes medical studies published in the more than 32 years since issuance of the 1981 report underlying the NCD, outweighs the NCD record and demonstrates that transsexual surgery is safe and effective and not experimental. Thus, as we discuss below, the grounds for the ...exclusion of coverage are not reasonable.' Now, it is expected that other private insurance companies, and possibly even Medicaid, will begin to approve this procedure for transgender individuals. And while it is wonderful news for Mallon, some see it as a little bittersweet. 'I'm so sad it took so long,' said Mallon's oldest daughter Kelly Mallon-Salter after the surgery. 'But I'm so happy that she's helping others to have it.' Standing strong: Mallon live the 'stealth lifestyle' until 2012, saying she was a woman and never telling anyone she was transgender . Difficult time: This news comes just a week after the tragic suicide of transgender teen Leelah Alcorn (above), who said her life 'wasn't worth living' because she was transgender . This step forward is even more poignant following the heartbreaking death of transgender teenager Leelah Alcorn last week, who wrote in her suicide note that her life 'wasn't worth living' because she was transgender. Alcorn's parents refused to accept their daughters identity, forcing her into therapy to try and change her, and the young girl cited their 'cruelty' in her note, which posted to Tumblr hours after her death. In the wake of the tragedy, her parents gave an interview saying they still do not accept their daughter's identity, and then asked Tumblr to remove their daughters suicide note, in which she wrote; 'I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights.' That dying wish is already being addressed by the Transgender Human Rights Institute, who have started a petition to 'call upon the President of the United State- Barack Obama, and the Leadership of the House and Senate to immediately seek a pathway for banning the practice known as 'transgender conversion therapy.'","Denee Mallon of Albequerque, New Mexico, has made history by becoming the first person to have sex reassignment surgery under Medicare .

"Much of America is about to get the Arctic shivers. Meteorologists are confidently forecasting frigid polar air will plunge south into the northern plains, Midwest and then the East Coast from next Tuesday through Thursday. The Midwest should see temperatures well below zero, with single digit lows in much of the East and freezing temperatures as far south as Atlanta, New Orleans and parts of Florida. National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Kocin, an expert on winter storms, said it is a classic pattern of massive blasts of Arctic air hitting just about everyone east of the Rockies. He said it will rival last year's January Arctic outbreak that introduced the phrase 'polar vortex' to America. Scroll down for video . This picture was taken outside a gas station in Michigan. Experts predict temperatures will plunge in the Great Lakes and Midwest next week . The dire wintry conditions were also captured from a car in Nebraska . Meteorologists are confidently forecasting frigid polar air will plunge south into the northern plains, Midwest and then the East Coast from next Tuesday, January 6 . 'This is going to be a big cold outbreak, pretty windy as well,' Kocin said. 'It's going to drive all the way down south.' The wind and cold could mean wind-chill factors that will make the temperature feel like 30 degrees below zero — 50 degrees below zero in Minneapolis and Chicago, said meteorologist Ryan Maue of the private Weather Bell Analytics. He called it 'old-timer's type of cold.' The mercury is also not expected to reach zero in New York and Boston, while Atlanta and Nashville will see their coldest days of the year. Kocin predicts a small Midwestern band of intense snow along with the cold, with some also in parts of the Northeast. Even though it is several days in advance, meteorologists are pretty sure about this forecast. Kocin said many of the best computer models are saying the same thing. This is all coming from cold air escaping from the Arctic. The center of the cold air will be around Quebec, Canada, where temperatures — not wind chill — may plunge as low as 40 degrees below zero, Maue said. A mix of precipitation on Saturday that included snow, ice and rain affected a swath from the Oklahoma Panhandle - where several inches of snow were in the forecast - to southern New England, where up to a quarter-inch of ice is possible in the eastern Berkshires. Freezing rain and ice factored into numerous accidents in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio and threatened an outdoor hockey game in Toledo. And parts of the southern U.S. saw heavy rain and thunderstorms, leading the National Weather Service to issue tornado watches and warnings in Mississippi and Louisiana and a flash flood watch for portions of Arkansas. This January 8, 2014, file photo shows homes covered in snow and ice in Paul Kocin, an expert on winter storms, said it will rival last year's January Arctic outbreak that introduced the phrase 'polar vortex' The weather service reported at least two confirmed tornadoes in Mississippi. Greg Flynn of Mississippi's Emergency Management Agency said homes were damaged in several counties, power lines were downed and there were reports of flooding. According to the Weather Channel, the chilly winds will hit in two spells. The first, starting today, will impact the northern states, the Midwest and Canada, with parts of the South enjoying temperatures in the mid-60s. However it will then move east as the week goes on, hitting southern cities including Birmingham, Alabama and Jacksonville, Florida. For many parts of the country it will be 35 degrees below average for this time of year, but the cold is only set to last for around a week, with temperatures warming up towards the weekend. However another cold spell is expected to hit the Great Lakes and North East the following week. In general the chill will be experienced further South than it was in the cold spell in January last year. The wind and cold could mean wind-chill factors that will make the temperature feel like 30 degrees below zero — 50 degrees below zero in Minneapolis and Chicago (pictured) The forecast for Wednesday shows temperatures dropping around the Great Lakes and Midwest .

"An Illinois man who was the bodyguard for high-profile televangelist Joyce Meyer has lost a bid in an appellate court this week after being convicted and sentenced to life in prison for strangling his wife and two sons to death. Christopher Coleman was 32 when he killed his wife, Sheri, 31, and their two boys Garett, 11, and Gavin, nine, in 2009, in order to start a new life with his mistress, a jury found. Prosecutors argued at his 2011 trial that Coleman feared he would lose his $100,000-a-year job as part of the personal security detail for multi-millionaire Pentecostal preacher  Meyer - who travels the world delivering evangelical lectures - if his affair were to become public. The year before the murders he started a relationship with Tara Lintz, a childhood friend of Coleman's wife, who testified that Coleman had promised he would serve divorce papers on May 5, 2009 - the same day his family were found murdered in their beds inside their Waterloo home. Wicked: Father-of-two Christopher Coleman - seen here wearing a bulletproof vest to his 2011 trial - was found guilty of killing his wife and his two sons and will spend the rest of his life in prison . Secrets: Christopher Coleman murdered his wife, Sheri, and sons Garett, left, and Gavin so he would be free to marry his mistress, a Florida cocktail waitress and a childhood friend of his wife . Picture perfect: The white suburban home that became the scene of a nightmare when the Colemans were found killed in their bedrooms in May, 2009 . Coleman allegedly spent six months plotting the brutal murder, shortly after beginning an affair with Miss Lintz, a Florida cocktail waitress. The jury was shown explicit photos and messages exchanged between the pair, including a video of Coleman masturbating. They had also filmed a sex tape in Hawaii. According to the prosecution, Coleman started sending his family threatening, expletive-filled messages from a gmail account he set up himself. The first read simply: 'Your family is done'. They continued with 'tell Joyce to stop preaching [expletive] or your Chris's family will die' and 'I will kill them all as they sleep.' But prosecutors say the threats were in fact a ploy to set up a mystery stalker as the murderer, the St Louis Post-Despatch reported at the time of the trial. The mistress: Florida cocktail waitress Tina Lintz admitted in court to having an affair with Coleman . High-profile employer: Multi-millionaire televangelist Joyce Meyer told the court 'it could definitely have affected his job' if Mr Coleman was found to have had an affair . They claim he decided to kill his wife rather than reveal his affair and go through a divorce . Charismatic Christian Meyer - who Coleman had known since he was a child - gave a pre-recorded testimony saying that Coleman most likely would have lost his job had he been revealed as having an affair. The day before killings, Coleman said he wasn't feeling well and was given the day off by Meyer, who said was unusual behavior for her employee. The next day, May 5, 2009, Coleman left his comfortable suburban house in Waterloo to go to the gym at 5.43am. After his workout he said he called home and was worried when no-one answered, so he rang a neighbor, police officer Justin Barlow, to check on his family. Double life: Christopher Coleman was having an affair with a friend of his wife, Sheri, for six months before his family were killed . Officer Jason Donjon, who entered the house with Mr Barlow, testified last week they found the house was covered in threatening messages daubed in red paint. The graffiti read: 'I am watching', 'punished' and 'u have paid'. Then they discovered the bodies of Mrs Coleman and her two sons, killed in separate bedrooms. Mrs Coleman was left naked in bed, strangled with a ligature. Her eldest son, Garett, was curled up in bed with spray paint on his sheets. Finally the youngest, Gavin, was seen lying face down with his limbs dangling either side of the bed and swear words daubed on his covers. Later, pathologist Dr Raj Nanduri, who performed the autopsy, said it was likely the victims were strangled between 3am and 5am - before Coleman left for the gym. Police also said they found a Word document on Coleman's computer that had details about Lintz, including her ring size, and even a name for their future child, Zoe. Coleman pleaded not guilty to all charges. Tragic: The Colemans lived in a comfortable suburban home, funded by Mr Coleman's $100,000-a-year job as Joyce Meyer's bodyguard. Mrs Coleman was 31 when she was strangled in her own bed . He has never admitted having anything to do with the murders. He was found guilty of three charges of first-degree murder in 2011. However his defense argued that a judge wrongly allowed hearsay testimony about his failing marriage. Coleman also questioned testimony about the victims’ time of death and prosecutors’ use of a forensic linguist and of sexually provocative photos and videos of Coleman’s mistress. The Mount Vernon-based 5th District Appellate Court issued a ruling Wednesday that found circumstantial evidence presented at Christopher Coleman’s Monroe County trial was 'overwhelming'. He will spend the rest of his life in prison.","Christopher Coleman was found guilty of murdering his wife and their two sons - aged 11 and nine - at their Waterloo home in 2009 .

"An image of skulls adorned with Jewish stars of David posted online by a Palestinian political party has sparked outrage. The picture was posted on social media by Fatah, the party of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, alongside the words: 'lingering on your skulls'. Ofir Gendelman, the Israeli Prime Minister's Arab media spokesman, described the image as 'despicable' and called into question how moderate the party is. 'Despicable': Ofir Gendelman, the Israeli Prime Minister's Arab media spokesman, described the image as 'despicable' and called into question how moderate the party is . The posting of the haunting picture, also depicting the party's flag and a gun, coincided with its 50th anniversary. The group was founded on January 1 1965, carrying out its first major attack against Israel, according to CNN. When the network contacted the Fatah Central Committee, a member disavowed the picture. 'Fatah did not design this image,' Mahmoud al-Aloul told CNN. The person who posted it to Fatah's page 'is currently being asked to remove it. The image and the text do not reflect the opinions of Fatah.' The post was later removed from the Facebook page. President: The picture was posted on social media by Fatah, the party of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, alongside the words: 'lingering on your skulls' The posting of the image comes as a decision by Abas on December 31 to enter into his most serious confrontation yet with Israel by signing onto the International Criminal Court (ICC). His decision on Wednesday gives the court jurisdiction over crimes committed in Palestinian lands and could even lead to cases being brought against Israeli or Palestinian leaders. The nearly 80-year-old former teacher, advocating non-violence, has spent his ten years in office trying to clamp down on armed groups and build up his administration in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. But the failure of peace talks this year to win a state or halt the spread of Israeli settlements seems to have clinched his decision that now is the time for what commentators on both sides describe as 'lawfare' - conflict by means of law. 'We've tried every possibility to reach a solution with the Israelis and we've spent 20 years of negotiations that didn't end their occupation over us,' senior Palestinian official Mohammed Shtayyeh said. 'So now we have taken a peaceful, legal option to internationalise this conflict.' U.S.-mediated Israeli-Palestinian talks collapsed in April 2014 amid mutual blame. It was the latest failure of negotiations to bring about peace and a Palestinian state since the Palestinian Authority under Abbas's predecessor, Yasser Arafat, came into being in 1993 under interim deals.","The picture was posted online by party of Palestinian Authority President .

"A former Army officer and Afghanistan veteran has become the first person to walk the length of the Nile - braving blistering heat, war-torn regions and terrifying encounters with crocodiles on the 4,250 mile journey. Levison Wood’s epic nine-month trek took him from the source of the world's longest river in Rwanda to the shores of the Mediterranean in Egypt. The 32-year-old, from Staffordshire, journeyed through six east African countries and his astonishing exploits were filmed for a Channel 4 documentary which will be aired tomorrow night. Scroll down for video . Epic journey: Levison Wood, who completed his 4,250 mile walk of the River Nile in September, poses with a member of the Mundari tribe in South Sudan . His monumental journey began in Rwanda in December 2013 - where the Nile's longest tributary is sourced - and finished in September last year. Mr Wood claimed that he left Africa with a sense of hope - despite a number of things going wrong on the expedition. Speaking to The Telegraph, he said: 'People were desperately trying to get themselves out of poverty. I also saw how incredibly hospitable they were to a man walking through Africa. 'We had this terrible tragedy along the way. It really brought home the reality of the risks involved in undertaking a journey like that.' This map shows the route taken by Levison Wood on his nine-month walk of the world's longest river . Adventurer: Mr Wood, pictured in Juba, South Sudan in April, said the most challenging aspect of the nine-month journey was the weather and terrain he faced . Mr Wood is referring to the death of American travel journalist Matthew Power, who collapsed and died of heat exhaustion in Uganda in March, while joining the walk for a week. The New York-based writer, who regularly worked for Outside, GQ, Men's Journal and other publications, died a few hours after losing consciousness. He adds: 'It was a terrible time. I knew the heat stroke could be dangerous but his death was very sudden and totally unexpected. 'Because of where we were it was impossible to get any sort of quick rescue. Once your body goes over 39C certain parts start to shut down; it's difficult to recover from without immediate treatment.' Mr Wood later encountered danger in  South Sudan when militiamen attacked a UN compound while he was in the town of Bor. Mr Wood, pictured at the top of the  Murchsion Falls in Uganda, said that he left Africa with a sense of hope - despite a number of things going wrong on the expedition . He was caught up in a firefight with the deafening sound of gunfire descending on the town and ending with several refuges being shot dead and wounded. Mr Wood added: 'It was a pretty hairy moment. It’s one thing dealing with that sort of thing when you are in the Army, but another when you are there without back up.' He said while dozens of people were being killed nearby, he was threatened by a soldier. The former soldier said: 'He put a gun to my face and said If I didn't leave the country he'd kill me.' He still had 400 miles to travel in South Sudan but he and the production team were forced to travel by car and plane to neighbouring Sudan. Tragic: American travel journalist Matthew Power, pictured above left, in Uganda with Levison Wood (centre), collapsed and died of heat exhaustion in March, while joining Mr Wood for a week of his expedition . Unexpected: The New York-based writer, who regularly worked for Outside, GQ, Men's Journal and other publications, died a few hours after losing consciousness . Before reaching the end of his trip it was estimated that he walked more than seven million steps. Speaking in April, he said: 'I've always had a passion for Africa since I was young. 'The river Nile has always interested me and I thought, what's the biggest expedition I could ever think of? And walking the Nile it was. 'We've had some close calls with buffalo, elephants and very close call with a crocodile in Murchison Falls (a national park in Uganda).' Though he faced many dangers on the walk from both man and beast, Mr Wood noted that past explorers didn't have the luxury of a satellite phone or Google maps. The adventurer said that terrain and weather had provided the biggest challenges of the mission - ranging over mountains, savannah and the Sahara. On average he walked 20 miles a day, but he was seldom alone. His guide from Congo, who goes by the name Boston, accompanied him. The adventurer is pictured walking near Juba, South Sudan in April - four months into his 4,250 mile trek . And in South Sudan three AK-47 wielding soldiers from the commando battalion flanked him as security with another man on a bike ferrying supplies. Mr Wood spent a number of years as an Officer in the British Parachute Regiment, where he served in Afghanistan fighting against Taliban insurgents in Helmand, Kandahar and Zabul in 2008. He describes himself as an explorer, writer and photographer who has covered conflicts, events and stories around the world for over ten years.

An RACQ North Queensland Rescue Helicopter transported the man to Mount Isa Hospital in a stable condition, before being treated for the injuries he sustained in the fall. An earlier attempt to lower ambulance staff down the cave had to be abandoned after heavy rain and lightning thwarted the process.

"Muslim hate preacher Abu Hamza should not be sent to a high security U.S. jail because of his disabilities, his lawyers say . Muslim hate preacher Abu Hamza should not be sent to a high security U.S. jail because of his disabilities, his lawyers say. Hamza, who has both arms amputated at the forearm and is missing an eye, was convicted in America in May of terrorism offences after he was extradited from Britain in 2012. His lawyers say the radical cleric, who preached at Finsbury Park Mosque, in London, should be sent to a prison medical centre so his health needs can be met. Hamza, 56, was found guilty of aiding terrorists who kidnapped tourists in Yemen in 1998 and others who plotted to open a terror training camp in the U.S. state of Oregon. Prosecutors have called for him to be sentenced to life in prison. But in court papers last week, Hamza's lawyers said he would face unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment if his amputated forearms, psoriasis, diabetes and high blood pressure were not taken into account at his sentencing in Manhattan this coming Friday. The hate preacher's lawyers acknowledge that he took part in 'terrible crimes', but argue that the US government made promises to Hamza about any future incarceration  during extradition proceedings from the UK. But prosecutors responded in court papers that the government never promised the UK that Hamza would not be assigned to a maximum security prison in Colorado. They also insisted life in prison was the only appropriate sentence, saying Hamza 'waged a global war of jihad against those that he considered infidels. He sent men to American soil to learn how to fight and kill in support of that war'. Hamza (left), who preached at Finsbury Park Mosque in London, plotted to open a terror training camp on U.S. soil . Prosecutors also submitted a letter from Jeffery Allen, chief of health programmes for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, who said Hamza would be given a full evaluation at a medical centre and assessed by a prosthetic specialist after he was sentenced. Mr Allen said there were special cells for those with disabilities and if the prison would not address Hamza's health needs, he would be moved to a prison medical care facility. Defence lawyers told the judge Hamza could not carry out routine daily living tasks and risked infection and amputation.","Abu Hamza should not be sent to high security jail 'because he is disabled'

"The murderer who gunned down two NYPD police officers in December was betrayed by his friends, passed around from home to home as a teenager and was sexually abused as a child. Ismaaiyl Brinsley killed Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu as they sat in their marked patrol car in the Bedford-Stuyvenstant district of Brooklyn on December 20 before shooting himself. The 28-year-old's vile act was in part motivated by the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown at the hands of police officers, but his friends have struggled to understand what led him to commit such an atrocity. His unstable upbringing and emotional turmoil leading up to December 20 may be to blame. The New York Times revealed that his friends betrayed him in May when they pistol-whipped him and robbed him while the girlfriend he was madly in love with dumped him around Thanksgiving, prompting him to try and take his own life. He was also passed around from home to home as a teenager and abandoned by his parents. When he was 14 years old, he tried to kill himself after being sexually abused while he lived a virtually homeless existence. Murderer: Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, killed Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu as they sat in their marked patrol car in the Bedford-Stuyvenstant district of Brooklyn before shooting himself . Upbringing: When he was 14 years old, he tried to kill himself after being sexually abused while he lived a virtually homeless existence . Before the shooting, after breaking up with girlfriend Shaneka Thompson, 29, he also threatened to hang himself, and had been disowned by his mother and two sisters for being violent and aggressive. A friend known as Mike Summerz on Instagram told the paper: 'I knew he had a lot on his mind.' Another close friend, Althea Hood, who saw him in early December during a visit to Atlanta also told the Times: 'I can't even understand why. Other than, what he did in the beginning with his girlfriend might have been a mistake, and then he lost it.' He struggled with depression but did not have hallucinations and, unlike his older brother, did not have schizophrenia. As a teenager he would spend spells living on the couches of any relative who was willing to take him. He travelled around the country and ended up being so estranged from his mother Shakuwra Dabre that she didn't know where he went to school. She split with Brinsley father when he was just nine years old. Brinsley became a thief in adulthood and was arrested 20 times while squatting anywhere he could. The charges included concealing a weapon, disorderly conduct, and trespassing. In a bid to kickstart his life, he tried to start two T-shirt companies - one selling designs with naked women on the front and another with state outlines emblazoned on the chest. Both of them failed. On social media he would pose in pictures wearing fashionable clothes and accessories, most of which were stolen. He also strived to be a ladies man, having a child with a woman who wanted to be a model at the age of 21. On Myspace, which he used when he was 21 and 22, Mr. Brinsley posted photographs of himself holding wads of cash, with a pistol tucked into his jeans, in an album called 'Grown, Gorgeous And Gangsta.' Turmoil: Close friends said he was deeply in love with Shaneka Thompson who had broken up with him on Thanksgiving. He shot her in the stomach on the day the two officers were killed . A close friend of Brinsley's - Las Vegas janitor Jay Romero (right) - described the shooter as 'intelligent' and 'funny' Brinsley often took to social media to show off images of his clothes and weapons. Just weeks before the deadly attack he uploaded this picture on Instagram . Thompson, 29, had dated Brinsley within the past year according to Baltimore County cops, although Delly said he knew nothing about the relationship and said he was 'shocked' that she would have had anything to do with a copkiller. Brinsley, 28, shot Thompson in the abdomen shortly before 6am in her upscale apartment in the Greenwich Place development, which overlooks the Owings Mill AMC Cinema's parking lot. He used the same silver 9mm semi-automatic handgun that killed NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu as they sat in their marked patrol car in the Bedford-Stuyvenstant district of Brooklyn. Police found a bullet in the apartment that matched those used to kill the police officers. NYPD officers have traveled to Maryland to interview her in a bid to find out what triggered Brinsley's murderous spree, but have not yet been able to speak to her because of the severity of her wounds. Brinsley stole Thompson's cellphone after he had shot her. It was the location 'pings' from that phone that let police know he was on his way to New York. Just moments before gunned down the officers, he asked passersby to follow him on Instagram and said 'watch what I'm going to do' before killing the two men. Speaking at a press conference the day after their deaths NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said: . Brinsley became a thief in adulthood and was arrested 20 times while squatting anywhere he could. The charges included concealing a weapon, disorderly conduct, and trespassing . 'His mother ... states he had a very troubled childhood and was often violent. His mother expressed fear of him and she hasn't seen him in one month. 'Brinsley attempted suicide in the past and attempted to hang himself a year ago.' He has been linked with crime before, and has served jail time in Georgia and Ohio. It also emerged today that has admitted to suffering mental health problems in the past. During a court hearing in Georgia's Cobb County in 2011, Brinsley was asked whether he had been in an institution or undergone treatment by mental health professionals, according to the New York Times. He answered yes. A close friend of Brinsley's - Las Vegas janitor Jay Romero - described the shooter as 'intelligent' and 'funny'. He also said confirmed Brinsley was in deeply love with Thompson, 29, who he shot in the stomach near Baltimore, Maryland before heading to New York.

"Profile: Ehsanullah Ehsan, pictured, listed his profession  as a spokesman for the TTP Jamaat Ahrar - a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban . A senior terror commander used a business networking site to advertise his twisted set of skills, it has been reported. Ehsanullah Ehsan listed his profession on LinkedIn as a spokesman for the TTP Jamaat Ahrar - a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban. He described himself as 'self-employed' and listed his skills as 'jihad and journalism'. He also provided details on his education, employment history and language skills. The account was taken down by the company on Friday after it was approached by reporters from The Sunday Telegraph, who saw Ehsan's claims. Ehsan formed Jamaat Ahrar along with former commanders of the the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, the Pakistan wing of the Taliban. The group declared their separation in August 2014. The newly-formed terror group was blamed for the devastating suicide bombing on the Attari-Wagah border in Pakistan last November that left at least 61 dead. Days after the attack, Ehsan issued a series of tweets, including one that identified the bomber and another that threatened India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had his Twitter account suspended after the incident, but now operates using a different name. A £650,000 bounty was placed on the terrorist's head in 2012 after he boasted that the group was responsible for the attempted assassination of schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai. A spokesman for the TTP told Pakistani newspaper The Express Tribune at the time that Malala was shot because she was a ’secular-minded lady’. Ehsan later tweeted that the teenager would not be safe if she survived the attack. A spokesman for LinkedIn told the Sunday Telegraph that the company's security team had decided to 'restrict' the account - meaning it was no longer in operation. Responsible: Ehsan had a £650,000 bounty put on his head in 2012 when he boasted the Pakistani Taliban was behind the assassination attempt on Malala Yousufzai.

She added: 'Our security team has a high degree of confidence that it is a fake account, which is reason enough to restrict it.'

However Fisher has now given an interview saying that Willis 'charged' at the group first in the suburban Cincinnati parking lot and that the subsequent fight 'was what it was'. Fisher said she had loaned her car to Willis her Chevrolet Impala 'back and forth from work', but that Willis had not returned it for a month and was avoiding Fisher's texts.

"Britons are running up debt at the fastest rate in seven years, after £1.25billion was borrowed on credit cards, loans and overdrafts in November. The Bank of England figures showed that November saw the biggest rise in unsecured borrowing since February 2008, when Northern Rock was nationalised and the credit crunch took hold. It comes as consumer helplines warn that people would be struggling to make ends meet when the first credit card bills of the year start to arrive this month. Scroll down for video . Experts say Black Friday promotions were probably linked to a new seven-year high in borrowing for UK consumers during November . Statistics released yesterday show that more than £980m was taken out in loans and overdrafts during November, a sharp rise from the average of £728m in the six months before. The report also shows that, despite credit card lending falling from £399m in October to £269m, it remained above the average for the previous six months. Experts said the surge in retail sales around Black Friday - when an estimated £810m was spent online - was probably linked to the increase in borrowing. Research carried out by R3, which represents those working in the insolvency sector, found that more than a quarter of adults were expecting to take on debt to pay for their celebrations. At the same time, banks and credit card companies were competing with offers in a bid to win new customers and balance transfer deals on credit cards became increasingly generous. Martin Beck at the EY Item Club told the Independent that growth rate was 'reminiscent of the credit-fuelled days of the mid-2000s'. And Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, told the Guardian that many households will probably be overstretched. She said: 'While most people will be able to cope with this extra borrowing, we are concerned that many households will have overstretched – particularly over the Christmas period.' Chief executive of the debt charity StepChange Mike O'Connor added that the figures 'point to a worrying rise in people's reliance on credit'. According to the figures, unsecured lending was up 6.9 per cent in November, compared with the previous year. It had grown at its most rapid pace since October 2005. The statistics also showed that consumers have borrowed more than they have paid off almost every month since September 2012. On the business lending side there was a more encouraging picture, with net lending to small and medium-sized businesses rising by £252m in November. It represented the biggest increase since the series was started by the Bank of England in 2011. But net lending to all non-financial businesses fell again by £1.1bn, while the figures showed a slowdown in mortgage lending. According to the R3 research carried out before Christmas, half of those planning to borrow money for the festive period were planning to use an existing credit card, while 24 per cent said they would use overdrafts. Some 14 per cent said they would borrow on a store card. Worryingly, 11 per cent planned to skip other spending commitments, like mortgage payments, while eight per cent expected to need a payday loan. Giles Frampton said: 'Taking on debts is fine so long as they’re affordable and people have a plan for how to pay the debt back. Pressure to spend is acute at Christmas.'","Figures show biggest rise in unsecured borrowing since February 2008 .

"Sarah Palin has taken to Facebook to defend a photo of her youngest son Trig standing on the family dog that sparked outrage. The photo, which Palin shared on New Year's Day, was met with outrage across social media and by PETA, who released a statement saying; 'It’s odd that anyone — let alone a mother — would find it appropriate to post such a thing, with no apparent sympathy for the dog in the photo.' Palin's response was written to PETA, who described her as a 'callous woman,' and focused not just on defending the photo but also asking why the organization has never objected to the actions of other celebrities - including President Obama. Scroll down for video . Firing back: Sarah Palin (above) has responded to critics of a photo she posted of her son Trig and the family dog . Outrage: PETA was upset over this photo of 6-year-old Trig Palin (above) standing on the family dog . Old news: Palin says that at least her son 'didn't eat the dog,' and then goes on to say that President Obama (above) 'enjoys eating dog meat' 'Did you go as crazy when your heroic Man-of-Your-Lifetime, Barack Obama, revealed he actually enjoyed eating dead dog meat?' asks Palin at one point. This after she begins by saying; 'At least Trig didn't eat the dog.' The comment is in reference to Obama's admission many years ago that as a child in Indonesia he did once eat dog meat, and while how much or little he enjoyed the taste is not known, he did mock Palin at the 2012 White House Correspondents' Dinner saying; 'What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? A pit bull is delicious.' Palin also asks why PETA never attacked Ellen DeGeneres for a photo that her show's Instagram page posted this past July of a child standing on her dog to brush her teeth, though that child, a little girl, does appear to be much younger and smaller than 6-year-old Trig. The photos posted by Palin were meant to show her son's resilience, as she wrote of the boy, who has Down Syndrome; 'He, determined to help wash dishes with an oblivious mama not acknowledging his signs for ""up!"", found me and a lazy dog blocking his way. He made his stepping stone.' And in her response, she shared just how much she and her family love all of their animals. 'Our pets, including Trig’s best buddy Jill Hadassah, are loved, spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or don’t fit your flighty standards,' says Palin. Love: 'Our pets, including Trig’s best buddy Jill Hadassah, are loved, spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man,' wrote Palin . Inspiring: The intial post was meant to inspire people at the start of 2015 by showing Trig's resilience . She also uses the post to attack PETA's opposition to Alaska's most famous annual event, the Iditarod, calling it 'the Last Great Race honoring dogs who are born to run in wide open spaces.' She then makes the claim that PETA, who she calls 'double-standard radicals,' keeps some of their pets 'in a concrete jungle where they’re allowed outdoors to breathe and pee maybe once a day.' Palin does however say that she and PETA do agree on one thing - 'respecting God’s creation and critters.' PETA, President Obama and Ellen DeGeneres have yet to respond to Palin's post. Dear PETA, . Chill. At least Trig didn’t eat the dog. Hey, by the way, remember your “Woman of the Year”, Ellen DeGeneres? Did you get all wee-wee’d up when she posted this sweet picture? Hypocritical, much? Did you go as crazy when your heroic Man-of-Your-Lifetime, Barack Obama, revealed he actually enjoyed eating dead dog meat? Aren’t you the double-standard radicals always opposing Alaska’s Iditarod – the Last Great Race honoring dogs who are born to run in wide open spaces, while some of your pets “thrive” in a concrete jungle where they’re allowed outdoors to breathe and pee maybe once a day? Aren’t you the same herd that opposes our commercial fishing jobs, claiming I encourage slaying and consuming wild, organic healthy protein sources called “fish”? (I do.) Aren’t you the same anti-beef screamers blogging hate from your comfy leather office chairs, wrapped in your fashionable leather belts above your kickin’ new leather pumps you bought because your celebrity idols (who sport fur and crocodile purses) grinned in a tabloid wearing the exact same Louboutins exiting sleek cowhide covered limo seats on their way to some liberal fundraiser shindig at some sushi bar that features poor dead smelly roe (that I used to strip from our Bristol Bay-caught fish, and in a Dillingham cannery I packed those castoff fish eggs for you while laughing with co-workers about the suckers paying absurdly high prices to party with the throw away parts of our wild seafood)? I believe you call those discarded funky eggs “caviar”. Yeah, you’re real credible on this, PETA. A shame, because I’ll bet we agree on what I hope is the true meaning of your mission – respecting God’s creation and critters. Our pets, including Trig’s best buddy Jill Hadassah, are loved, spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or don’t fit your flighty standards.

"A Japanese student was allegedly gang raped by five men who kidnapped her and subjected her to more than a month of sexual abuse in eastern India. The 23-year-old woman was lured to a house near a Buddhist shrine in Bihar state in November by a tour guide, where she says she was raped by five men. After a month, the men are said to have taken her for medical treatment in a nearby town where she escaped and made her way to Calcutta. Scroll down for video . A Japanese student was allegedly kidnapped and gang raped by five Indian men near the Buddhist shrine Bodh Gaya for a month . The 23-year-old woman was lured to a village near the pilgrimage site (monks at Bodh Gaya pictured) in eastern India in November by a tour guide . Five Indian men have been arrested in connection with the alleged abduction and gang rape. This includes tour guide brothers Sajid Khan, 32, and his 25-year-old brother Jawed Khan,  police deputy superintendent Alok Kumar Singh said. 'One of the men spoke very fluent Japanese,' Pallav Kanti Ghosh, a Calcutta police commissioner, told the BBC. 'They said: ""We are guides and want to take you sight-seeing."" 'They took her to Digha (a beach resort) on 23 November. There they sexually assaulted her and robbed her of 76,000 rupees [£1,200] using her ATM card.' The Japanese tourist was held hostage at gunpoint in an underground room close to the shrine from, according to a preliminary investigation by detectives. Three weeks later she was taken to Gaya, a larger town 10 miles away, for medical treatment, where she escaped. She made her way to Calcutta and sought help at the Japanese consulate on December 26. The Bodh Gaya complex is home to one of the earliest Buddhist temples still standing in India and attracts visitors from all over the world. India has faced intense scrutiny over its efforts to curb violence against women following the fatal gang rape of a medical student on a bus in Delhi in 2012. The student says she was kidnapped in Bodh Gaya and made her way to Calcutta, otherwise known as Kolkata, after she escaped . In a separate case, two police officers are on the run after allegedly abducting and gang raping a 14-year-old girl at their police station on New Year's Eve in Badaun, Uttar Pradesh. Since then, several attacks on foreign women have also been reported, including that of a 51-year-old  Danish tourist who was robbed and gang raped at knife-point in Delhi last January. A Swiss cyclist holidaying in central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh was robbed and gang raped by five men, all of whom were later sentenced to life sentences. Yesterday two police officers were on the run after allegedly abducting and gang raping a 14-year-old girl at their police station on New Year's Eve. Constables Veer Pal Singh Yadav and Avnish Yadav were suspended before absconding from the police station in Badaun, Uttar Pradesh. Badaun, located in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly region, gained notoriety last year after two girls were found hanging from a tree in a village amid reports they had been gang-raped and murdered. In November investigators concluded that the girls had committed suicide, however many have disputed this explanation.

"Two babies were born with incurable diseases after shocking blunders in IVF treatment that should have screened out the dangerous inherited conditions. Both mothers had gone to the same clinic to ensure they did not pass on life-limiting illnesses that ran in their families. But mistakes at a laboratory used by the CARE Fertility Nottingham IVF clinic resulted in the outcome the women had so desperately wanted to avoid. Scroll down for video . Two babies were born with incurable diseases after shocking blunders in IVF treatment that should have screened out the dangerous inherited conditions (file picture) The fertility watchdog has damned the incidents as ‘grade A’ errors – the rare and most severe type. One mother wanted to screen out sickle cell anaemia – a serious blood disorder that can lead to complications including strokes, breathing problems and high blood pressure. The other patient wanted to stop her child from developing neurofibromatosis, which causes tumours to grow along the body’s nerves and can reduce a sufferer’s lifespan by up to 15 years. But after mistakes by a laboratory used by the clinic, both women became pregnant and gave birth to babies who had these illnesses. The mix-up is revealed in a report which has been published by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). The couple whose baby has neurofibromatosis – which carries the risk of major problems including learning difficulties and cancer – were ‘distraught’ when the clinic broke the news, according to the medical director of CARE Fertility Nottingham, Maha Ragunath. A spokeswoman for HFEA said last night: ‘These two incidents are very serious and have no doubt been devastating for the couples involved. They had treatment to have a healthy child but may now have children affected by a serious genetic condition.’ The two mothers’ identities have not been disclosed. They originally went to the clinic for a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) – a cutting-edge technique that allows genetic testing of an embryo for inherited diseases before it is implanted as part of IVF treatment. Under strict regulations, this type of screening is available only to women who are at high risk of passing on a serious genetic disorder. The clinic, which also treats NHS patients, charges £4,840 to screen for a single gene disorder. It is not known if the two women were being treated on the NHS or privately. The clinic screens its embryo samples at a Nottingham laboratory run by Genesis Genetics Europe (GGEu). Describing itself as a pioneer in screening embryos for inherited genetic abnormalities, the company’s products include Genesis Serenity, which it calls ‘the best performing non invasive prenatal test’. The mother whose child developed neurofibromatosis began IVF treatment in June 2013. The lab reported back to the clinic that three of her embryos were affected by neurofibromatosis, but two were clear. The clinic discarded the three embryos with the gene disorder. Of the two embryos deemed by the lab to be free of the genetic defect, one was frozen for future use and the second was implanted in the would-be mother’s womb. Shortly after the woman was told she was pregnant. But the next day the lab contacted the clinic to say the PGD results had been misinterpreted by its staff. The implanted embryo had the defective gene, while the three discarded had been healthy. The clinic told the woman and her partner about the mistake two days later and she had to decide whether to have an abortion or continue with the pregnancy. She opted to keep the child, who is believed to have been born in early 2014. In the case of the second woman, sickle cell anaemia ran in her family and she already had a child with the condition. The woman had IVF treatment and genetic screening of her embryos in 2008, but did not become pregnant. After this first attempt she had two frozen embryos stored at the Nottingham clinic. Four years later she decided to have these transferred to a London fertility centre to be implanted and this time the procedure was successful. But after the woman gave birth, tests revealed the baby has sickle cell anaemia. The Nottingham lab had failed to utilise newer techniques that were unavailable in 2008 that would have increased the likelihood of the condition being screened out. An HFEA spokeswoman said last night that after an investigation it was satisfied the neurofibromatosis case was an ‘isolated incident’ rather than due to poor practice. The regulator stressed that GGEu had now introduced a system for retesting frozen embryos where necessary. Professor Simon Fishel, managing director of CARE Fertility clinics, confirmed the continued use of the Genesis Genetics laboratory services. ‘Although we are very upset that the misdiagnosis occurred, there is always an element of risk with cutting-edge medicine,’ he said. Genesis Genetics UK laboratory director Tony Gordon said: ‘The matters in question are subject to ongoing, complex investigations and proceedings.’","Both mothers went to same clinic to ensure they did not pass on life-limiting illnesses .

"When the republican revolutionaries set up their barricades in Paris in 1832, they had a lot more on their mind than setting off a smoke alarm. But as the cast of Les Miserables started to recreate the scenes at a world-famous London theatre this afternoon, the building's electrical equipment had other ideas.

"A 23-year-old man called 999 claiming he was American rapper Nicki Minaj, while he was drunk . A 23-year-old  man has been banned from drinking after he called 999 claiming he was rapper Nicki Minaj and that he had seen a ghost while he was drunk. Steven Brown from Crumlin, Country Antrim in Northern Ireland, made two calls within five minutes of each other to the emergency services on Christmas Day, a court heard. The first call was reportedly made at about 10.15am on December 25 where Brown claimed two men were making threats to kill him but was too intoxicated to provide more information. Prosecutors at Belfast High Court said that five minutes later he rang again and told the operator he wanted to cancel the first call, according to the Irish Times. During the second call he also claimed to be the 32-year-old American rapper and said there was a poltergeist in his house. The court was told the phone calls were in breach of a previous ASBO, which banned him from using the emergency number. Brown did not deny making the calls when police arrived at his house to arrest him and told officers he felt there was an emergency when he dialled the number. Prosecutors told the court that he Brown had recently been released from prison 'after serving a sentence for offences of a similar nature' and that he was an alcoholic. A defence barrister said Brown had been released from hospital and was taking medication but, against the advice of doctors, had consumed alcohol. Lord Justice Coghlin, hearing the bail application, said: 'This man is essentially a nuisance, which no doubt is a product of his alcoholism. 'Police have better things to do that cope with these telephone calls.” Brown was released on his own bail of £250, banned him from possessing and consuming alcohol and from dialling 999, except in an emergency. He also imposed a 10pm-7am curfew.

MPs vented their fury at Coalition Ministers for insisting on a fixed, five-year parliament when they ran out of ideas ‘six months ago’. Labour said there was now so little legislation to discuss that Tory backbenchers were only expected to turn up at Westminster for barely a month between now and the Election on May 7. MPs have vented their fury at Coalition Ministers for insisting on a fixed, five-year parliament amid claims the Commons has virtually no legislation to discuss before the General Election. Even Conservative MPs are concerned. Tory MP Charles Walker, chairman of the Commons Procedure Committee, said: ‘There’s a natural rhythm to British politics that has served us well for decades and it’s a four-year rhythm. I’d prefer to do away with the whole idea of fixed terms.’ In a controversial move after the last General Election, the Tory/Liberal Democrat Coalition pushed through a new law that parliaments must last a full five years except in exceptional circumstances. This was seen as an attempt by David Cameron and Nick Clegg to prevent rebel MPs voting with Labour to boot the fragile Coalition out of office. But MPs across the political divide are now complaining that the fifth year has become one long ‘anteroom’ to the Election – with the Commons all but devoid of serious Government business to discuss. In an article for The Mail on Sunday (see below) Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Jonathan Ashworth said the Coalition was presiding over a zombie Parliament with little sign of Government activity. Tory MPs, he said, had effectively been told to turn up for only 33 days between now and when Parliament is dissolved for the Election. The fixed-term parliament law was pushed through by the Coalition after they came into power in 2010 . Mr Ashworth stopped short of saying that a Labour government would scrap the five-year rule. But two other senior Shadow Ministers privately said that Parliament should sit for four years at most. Labour backbench MP Kevin Barron called for a return to the rule where prime ministers were able to name the date of the Election, but no Parliament could sit for more than five years. The current situation at Westminster had led to a ‘paralysis of power’, he said. No 10 last night denied the Coalition had run out of steam, saying it was making ‘good progress’ with its legislative programme of 18 Government Bills this parliamentary session. Shadow Minister Jonathan Ashworth said the Coalition was presiding over a zombie Parliament . For the past two weeks or so, barely a mouse has stirred in the Palace of Westminster. Apart from the traditional New Year’s Eve party on the Commons’ Terrace, the grand old building has been silent. Which is how it should be. Even MPs and peers like to celebrate Christmas with their families, away from the normal Punch and Judy knockabout of Westminster politics – especially with a General Election looming. But with the Commons back to work tomorrow, you’d expect that there would be hardly so much as a day off between now and that appointment with the voters on May 7. After all, we’ve just had two weeks off to recharge the batteries. Surely now it’ll be full steam ahead, the place fizzing as David Cameron strains every sinew on every available day to get vital legislation through before Parliament breaks for the Election. How wrong you’d be. A glance at the official parliamentary calendar, set by the Coalition parties, reveals that there will, in fact, be many more days when the Commons is as quiet as Christmas – only this time without any justification. With 122 days to go before polling day, MPs are scheduled to be sat on the famous Commons’ green benches for way under half that: a grand total of 49 days. In practice, it’ll be even fewer after the inevitable extra breaks are added in at the last minute. Why? Because the Tory/Liberal Democrat Coalition ran out of ideas months ago. The paltry number of sitting days actually tells only half the story. Even when MPs are physically at Westminster, there is precious little to do – aside from the work of backbench MPs or motions put forward by the Labour opposition. Official parliamentary records show that in the year or so up to June 2014, we had the lowest number of Government Bills since 1950. With 122 days to go before polling day, MPs are scheduled to attend Westminster for just 49 days . Since last summer, there’ve been even fewer signs of activity from the Government benches – so few that Tory Chief Whip Michael Gove recently told his MPs not to bother coming in on Thursdays in future. Take those out, and the Fridays they inevitably take off as well, and it won’t be 49 Commons’ days left for many Tories but 33 at best before Parliament is dissolved at the end of March. Ministers may dismiss these criticisms as just partisan point-scoring from a Labour MP against a Tory-led government. They’d be wrong. Even many Conservatives are privately embarrassed at how little they have to do at Westminster. There are major national and global challenges that the Government should be addressing – assisted and enabled by parliamentary scrutiny. Yes, there’s an Election coming and MPs of all colours will be itching to get out there campaigning. But I, like so many of my fellow MPs, want to be part of an active, vibrant democratic process not a Zombie Parliament that just goes through the motions of being the cockpit of the nation. Jonathan Ashworth is Labour MP for Leicester South.","MPs vent their fury at Coalition for insisting on a fixed, five-year parliament .

"Over the years, it has played host to supermodels, singers and playboys. The property was even the favoured venue for sex parties thrown by one of the Duchess of Cambridge’s erstwhile chums. Now 33 Portland Place, the Grade II-listed Georgian mansion owned by fraudster ‘fast Eddie’, is to be sold to an equally colourful character – porn publisher David Sullivan. When self-styled ‘Lord’ Edward Davenport was convicted of a multi- million-pound fraud and jailed for eight years in 2011, he was told to pay a confiscation order of £12 million as well as £2 million to 51 victims. Released from prison on compassionate grounds last May after a kidney transplant, Davenport has been loath to part with his London home, despite it descending into faded grandeur over the past few years. Scroll down for video . David Sullivan, pictured, will buy the Grade-II listed Georgian mansion owned by 'Lord' Edward Davenport . 'Lord' Edward Davenport, right, pictured in the mansion he bought before his downfall in 1998 . But unable to raise funds to pay his victims he has been forced to sell the Marylebone mansion he bought in 1998 for a knockdown price – for £25 million. Sullivan intends to spend a further £25 million restoring the building to its former splendour with his wife, Emma Benton-Hughes, overseeing the refurbishment. ‘David intends to spare no expense on its restoration,’ said one of Sullivan’s circle. ‘He intends to sell it on for a huge profit.’ Built in 1776, the 24-bedroom house was the location for the Oscar- winning film The King’s Speech, starring Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter, and was also used in 2004 for The Life and Death Of Peter Sellers and Vera Drake. Kate Moss was filmed on the staircase in a racy basque and stockings for an Agent Provocateur advertisement and Amy Winehouse shot a video for her single Rehab there. More recently, the address had become a byword for decadence and promiscuity. Davenport had a lucrative sideline hiring out his home to Emma Sayle, who used to go to school with the Duchess of Cambridge. Amid its increasingly seedy and shabby surroundings, she hosted marathon sex parties. It is believed that Sullivan will pay £25 million for the 24-bedroom house in Marylebone, pictured . The lower ground floor, with its nightclub area, hot tub and flashing lights, featured in scores of her infamous Killing Kittens get-togethers as well as in porn movies. At one party, Courvoisier built a swimming pool and filled it with 4,000 litres of cocktail so revellers could row across it. But the louche parties ended abruptly in 2010 when the High Court ruled that commercial activity at the house was banned. Last night, friends said Davenport, who rose to fame in the 1980s with his boozy Gatecrasher balls, was heartbroken to lose his home. ‘Eddie is incredibly unhappy about the sale, but he doesn’t have a choice,’ one said. ‘The truth is he is devastated. He thinks it is all shockingly unfair.’","'Lord' Edward Davenport bought the 24-bedroom London mansion in 1998 .

"The deadly Ebola outbreak will be ended in 2015, the outgoing chief of the United Nations team fighting the virus has said. Anthony Banbury said the number of Ebola cases would be brought down to zero by the close of the year, but admitted there was a 'long and difficult way to go'. He said: 'We are engaged in a big battle with this disease.' Scroll down for video . Anthony Banbury (pictured) will step aside as head of the Ebola Emergency response mission today . Mr Banbury said the target of having 100 per cent burials by the end of the month was now on track . The virus, first identified in Guinea's remote south-east in December 2013, has killed nearly 8,000 people, mostly in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Faced with criticism that not enough was being done to combat the disease, UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon set up the UN Ebola Emergency Response mission (UNMEER) in September. Mr Banbury, who headed that mission, said: 'We have a long and difficult path ahead of us. We have not come anywhere close to ending the crisis. 'We have done a lot in 90 days. It has been a very successful response effort but we have a long way to go. 'In terms of looking forward we are engaged in a big battle with this disease that attacks people who shows acts of caring and kindness. 'It is going to be extremely hard for us to bring it down to zero, but that is what we will do. I believe we will end Ebola in 2015.' The virus, first identified in Guinea's remote south-east in December 2013, has killed nearly 8,000 people . A spike of cases in Sierra Leone meant UNMEER missed its target of ensuring 70 per cent of all Ebola patients were being treated in isolation units by early December and the same number who died from Ebola were buried properly. Mr Banbury said there were now enough functioning treatment centres in the region. He said the target of 100 per cent safe burials by end of January 2015 was now on track. Mr Banbury will be replaced by veteran humanitarian official Ould Cheikh Ahmed of Mauritania today.

The nurse was diagnosed with Ebola on Monday and was seen today walking from an ambulance at Glasgow Airport as she was moved by military aircraft to London yesterday . After being put on a cocooned bed Ms Cafferkey was loaded on to the jet, which took off on Monday morning and landed at RAF Northolt near Heathrow . Earlier this week, the World Health Organization said the number of people infected by the virus in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea had passed 20,000. Last week, Save the Children nurse Pauline Cafferkey was diagnosed with the virus in Glasgow upon her return from Sierra Leone. She is being treated with plasma from patients who have survived the virus and an experimental antiviral drug at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London. It is the same isolation unit that nursed William Pooley back to health after he contracted Ebola in August. He recovered and has returned to West Africa to continue his mission.","Anthony Banbury says the deadly Ebola virus will be ended in 2015 .

"One of Britain’s leading children’s brain doctors snorted cocaine and an illegal party drug just before going on call at a major NHS hospital. Shocking video footage shows Dr Colin Ferrie asking for a syringe to measure out the powerful sedative - a so-called ‘date rape drug’ known as GHB - before leaning over a kitchen worktop to consume a long line of cocaine. Over nearly two debauched hours, in blatant contravention of hospital rules, the consultant paediatric neurologist took dose after dose of the highly addictive GHB and snorted nearly three grams of cocaine with an acquaintance. Yet just over an hour later, the switchboard operator at Leeds General Infirmary where he works confirmed Dr Ferrie was on call – a role that involves making life-or-death decisions about his young patients, who suffer from disorders such as epilepsy and brain tumours. Following The Mail on Sunday’s investigation, the hospital has ordered an urgent inquiry and suspended the consultant from clinical work. Last night, patients’ groups said families would be horrified that a doctor looking after children could be taking mind-altering substances. Joyce Robins, co-director of Patient Concern, said: ‘You can’t have somebody taking things like that making life-or-death decisions.’ Hospital rules, as laid out by the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, state staff should not take any substances that affect judgment either before starting shifts or while on duty, including on call. Yet Dr Ferrie’s recorded comments and texts to his acquaintance suggest intimate familiarity with illegal recreational drugs. In the film footage, taken by his companion, Scots-born Dr Ferrie is shown snorting a long line of cocaine after declaring: ‘Looking good, that.’ The drug can make users over-confident and impair decision- making abilities. It can also lead to fatal overdoses. Those caught in possession of the Class A narcotic can be jailed for up to seven years. After snorting the cocaine, Dr Ferrie turns to his acquaintance, takes the bottle of GHB – which he refers to as ‘G’ – and measures out a dose with a teaspoon and mixes it with blackcurrant squash. The doctor warns: ‘You’ve got to be careful – really careful – that you don’t take too much of this stuff.’ He also says: ‘I love to have a wee spot of this stuff.’ When his companion says that he finds ‘it [G] hard to get hold of,’ Dr Ferrie tells him: ‘I get mine in Manchester.’ GHB – or Gamma-hydroxybutyrate – is popular with clubbers for loosening inhibitions, but its sedative effects when slipped into drinks mean it is also known as a date-rape drug. It is often referred to as liquid ecstasy. Government websites warn it can lead to ‘unconsciousness, coma and death’ as well as causing memory loss and affecting judgment. Dr Ferrie also expresses his fondness for crystal meth – which he refers to by the street name ‘Tina’ – a dangerously addictive Class A drug, the effects of which can last for days. Dr Ferrie, 51, is regarded as one of the foremost experts on childhood epilepsy and holds national and international posts on prestigious bodies. In 2007 he was part of a training team that received a Joint Epilepsy Council award, he is the national training adviser for the British Paediatric Neurology Association and has given evidence in court cases and inquests about children who have had seizures, including at a murder trial. Married with a teenage daughter, Dr Ferrie has worked at Leeds General Infirmary for 18 years, while his wife Elaine is a nurse in its neonatal intensive care unit. But just before Christmas he took time out to consume a cocktail of drugs while officially ‘on call’ for his patients. Dr Ferrie’s secret life was brought to this paper’s attention by an acquaintance who said that they had met on 20 occasions since last June, consuming illegal drugs each time. ‘He told me he was a doctor and that he worked at the teaching hospital in Leeds, but never went into any detail,’ said the man. ‘It is only very recently I discovered that he was working with brain-injured children. I was totally shocked that someone with that much responsibility would take so many hard drugs.’ On Wednesday, December 17, the eminent consultant took the train from his home in a village near Bradford to London on business but as soon as he started his return journey, he began making preparations for his depraved pastime. In a series of text messages, arrangements were made for three grams of cocaine to be brought to an early-evening meeting at the acquaintance’s house, while Dr Ferrie said he would bring GHB. Dr Ferrie asked: ‘What can you get and how much is it?’ When his acquaintance claimed he ‘can get coke’ for £30, Dr Ferrie replied: ‘OK. Get three,’ adding: ‘I have some G.’ Arriving at the man’s smart semi-detached house in Bradford at 4.40pm, Dr Ferrie wasted no time in indulging his habit. He immediately produced his bottle of GHB with the words, ‘You’re gonna like that’, before placing it next to the pile of cocaine waiting for him on the kitchen counter. Gesturing to the cocaine, he said it was ‘looking good’ before giving a throaty chuckle. He asked for a syringe to measure out the liquid GHB. ‘You got a syringe to measure this out?’ he asked the man. ‘Have I got a what?’ ‘Like a syringe to measure this G out,’ he repeated. The man asked the doctor what flavour squash he wanted to mix it with. ‘Do you want orange, apple or blackcurrant?’, to which the doctor replied: ‘Yeah, whatever, it doesn’t matter.’ The video then clearly showed him snorting a long line of cocaine from a chopping board. Still short of a syringe, Dr Ferrie then started to look for a spoon. ‘Have you got a teaspoon anywhere? Is there one in this drawer?’ ‘Middle drawer,’ said the man. Dr Ferrie then stirred the cocktail of ‘G’ and juice. He offered the drink to his acquaintance, who declined, then, after a gulp of the liquid and a line of cocaine, the pair headed to another part of the house, carrying the drugs with them. There, the conversation continued with further lines of cocaine and gulps of GHB being taken by the doctor at roughly 20-minute intervals. In a tape-recorded conversation, the doctor extolled the pleasures of crystal meth. He asked his acquaintance: ‘Have you ever done Tina? I would love to do Tina with you one time. It is methamphetamine. Two days later, you still feel it.’ As he prepared to leave, he asked: ‘Do you want me to leave you that G? You had it before? One thing – you need at least an hour between hits, right, and you need to measure it properly.’ After a final line of cocaine, the doctor left the house, jumping into his battered Audi A4 and speeding away. Within a minute of leaving at 6.30pm, he pulled up on a side road and following a ten-minute phone call, drove off at speed but not to his marital home. In a phone call to Leeds General Infirmary at 7.45pm, just over an hour after he left the Bradford house, The Mail on Sunday was told that Dr Ferrie was ‘on call’ although the receptionist was unable to say whether he was in the hospital or at home. The next day he left the luxury detached home which he shares with his wife and daughter at 7.10am, from where he commuted to Leeds General, arriving just after 8am. A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: ‘We take any allegations of this nature extremely seriously and will be carrying out a thorough investigation. Patient safety is our main priority and we expect all members of staff to behave in a professional and appropriate manner at all times. PRESTIGIOUS: Dr Colin Ferrie, circled, in 2007 at the House of Lords with fellow epilepsy training experts to receive a top award for their work from Earl Howe, second from left, now a Tory Health Minister . This person answered the door at Dr Colin Ferrie's home today after footage emerged today showing him consuming drugs . ‘It is policy when investigating allegations of this nature that staff involved do not carry out clinical duties during the investigation.’ Trust rules make it clear that staff cannot take drugs while on call – but they are more likely to get counselling than the sack. It states: ‘The consumption of alcohol, or other substances that might impact on judgment or performance, by employees is considered inappropriate prior to the commencement of duty, whilst on duty, during meal breaks or at any other time when it might result in unacceptable work performance (eg on call). Being under the influence of alcohol or other substances at work can result in disciplinary action. ‘However, alcohol and drug dependency will normally be dealt with as a capability, rather than disciplinary, issue. The Trust will offer confidential support and counselling through the occupational health department and, where appropriate, by referral to external agencies.’ Dr Ferrie did not respond to requests for comment. The doctor could also face misconduct proceedings from the General Medical Council. Chairman of the health select committee, Dr Sarah Wollaston, said she could not comment on his circumstances but said: ‘In cases of substance abuse, we expect the GMC to act to protect patients.’ Additional reporting: Martin Beckford and Stephen Adams .","Film shows Dr Colin Ferrie asking for syringe to measure out powerful sedative - a ‘date rape drug’ known as GHB .

Floral tributes were left outside the church. Miss McQuade's mother Jacqueline witnessed her daughter and parents being killed . Today, Miss McQuade's anguished mother Jacqueline - who witnessed her daughter and parents being killed as she withdrew cash nearby - arrived at St Patrick's RC Church in the family's home town of Dumbarton to bid farewell to her family. She was joined by Erin's two teenage brothers and her six-year-old sister, as well as around 1,000 mourners, some of whom spilled out in front of the church during the joint requiem mass. In a moving address, Archbishop Tartaglia, the Archbishop of Glasgow, told how the three family members had been struck down 'in front of Jacqueline's eyes' during a happy Christmas shopping trip in the city. He said: 'Jack and Lorraine's daughters, Jacqueline and Yvonne are also Erin's heartbroken mum and sorrowing aunt. This is a family devastated by the tragic deaths all at once of three much-loved members. 'They were struck down in front of Jacqueline's eyes. A festive and happy Christmas shopping excursion to Glasgow had become the worst of nightmares. What happened was random, cruel and meaningless.' He added: 'Their last day on this earth said it all.

Jack Sweeney, 68, said to be Mrs Sweeney's 'childhood sweetheart', was also killed in the horror crash . Family and friends of Erin McQuade, a Glasgow University student, flocked to the church today to pay tribute to the tragic teenager . 'They died as they lived - together. It is fitting that they should share the same funeral Mass. They will be buried in the same grave.' The Archbishop had previously told a memorial mass that he wept with the woman who saw her teenage daughter and both parents die almost in front of her. Today, he told how the Sweeneys had been 'very happily married' for over 45 years and that they had been 'responsible for creating a loving family who were very close to each other'. He described Miss McQuade, a Glasgow University student, as a 'light-.hearted, caring, family-loving girl' and that her parents Jacqueline and Matt will 'always mourn for her'. The archbishop added the she had been 'very dear to her young brothers and sister', adding: 'They have tried to be so brave over these days, and so supportive to their mum and dad, but are deeply saddened and are missing her sorely'. He said the teenager's parents had been 'so deeply saddened by Erin's death' and said that they would 'always feel the searing pain of her loss'. 'Just as her life was opening up and she was spreading her wings, cruel fate took her away,' he said. The service, which included readings from family members Elizabeth McQuade and Hazel McQuade, began with the hymn I Watch the Sunrise. On the back of the order of service a message from the family said: 'The family would like to thank you for your presence here today. They would like to express their gratitude for the love, sympathy and support shown to them at this sad time.' Primary school teacher Stephenie Tait, 29, (left) and Gillian Ewing, 52 (right) from Edinburgh, were also killed in the crash . After the service ended, the family members carried the three coffins to three hearses waiting outside the church in heartbreaking silence. Many of the mourners were crying as they left, with some hugging each other in an attempt to provide comfort. The service was followed by burials at Dumbarton Cemetery, which was also held in private. Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson, Scottish Justice Secretary Michael Matheson and Jackie Baillie, the MSP for Dumbarton, were also among those who came to pay their respects. Another mourner at the funeral was David McCallum. Although he does not know the family, he organised a candlelit vigil following the tragedy which was attended by 2,000 people. On Sunday, some 1,500 people fell silent at the vigil in Glasgow's Royal Exchange Square, adjoining Queen Street, where hundreds of bouquets of flowers and candles have been placed in memory of the victims. Speaking to Sky News this morning, he told how he was overwhelmed with the support of the public. Family members of the three victims have previously told how they do not blame the bin lorry driver for the crash. Marc Gardiner, the nephew of Lorraine and Jack Sweeney, took to Twitter after the tragedy to thank everyone for their messages of support. He tweeted: 'Been a really emotional and overwhelming day and on behalf of my family I just want to say thank you to everyone around Scotland sending in there condolences and best wishes! Six people died and eight were injured following the devastating crash in Glasgow city centre on Monday, December 22 . How the horror unfolded: 1) Bin lorry is travelling north along Queen Street when it mounts pavement. 2) A woman is hit close to the Duke of Wellington statue. 3) Two women are hit near La Vita Pizzeria in Queen Street, while several other people are struck further along the road. 4) The lorry careers through traffic lights and across St Vincent's Place. 5) It hits a silver Skoda taxi, knocking it across the road at the entrance to Queen Street station. 6) In this picture taken from inside the railway station, the Skoda and bin lorry are seen when they come to rest . 'I hope that the other families that are going through what me and my family are get all the support possible and I hope that the driver of the lorry makes a speedy recovery and understands that it wasn't his fault. 'And a big thanks to all emergency services yesterday for doing everything possible. RIP Uncle Jackie, Aunt Lorraine and Erin, love you loads and can't believe your gone, you'll be truly missed.' The horror crash took place on Monday, December 22, while thousands were shopping in the city centre. The lorry left a 300m trail of destruction in its wake before crashing into the side of the Millennium Hotel in George Square. Primary teacher Stephenie Tait, 29, and tax worker Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were also killed. Three patients remain in two Glasgow hospitals following the crash. A 14-year-old girl and a 64-year-old woman remain in stable conditions at the Royal Infirmary. A 57-year-old man - thought to be the driver - is in a stable condition at the Western Infirmary. Investigations into the crash are continuing.","Jack Sweeney, 68, his wife Lorraine, 69, and their granddaughter Erin McQuade, 18, killed in Glasgow lorry crash .

"What does the eldest of four daughters need when all of her sisters are either married or engaged? Apparently, a drink. In a hilarious photo posted by Arlene Lassin, a Huffington Post blogger, the writer shows her friend Lauren Finkelstein standing next to her three sisters, according to the Post. As her three younger sisters show off their wedding or engagement rings, Finkelstein shows off a bottle of champagne as she pours herself a glass. Show Off: (Left to right) Melanie, Melissa, and Amy show off their wedding or engagement rings as Lauren Finkelstein pours herself a glass of champagne . Oldest: Finkelstein, 32,  (photographed) is a disc jockey in Houston and the oldest out of four girls . Lassin wrote that Finkelstein's youngest sister, Melanie, recently got engaged and with that, Finkelstein needed to prepare herself for the impending slew of questions from family members concerned about her 'biological clock' -- hence the glass of champagne. At 32, Finkelstein is a single,  popular disc jockey on a top 40 Houston station, according to Lassin. Finkelstein knows that among the congratulations her sister will receive on her engagement, she will receive just as many questions about when she's going to get married and start a family. 'I've been asked so many times when is it going to be my turn, I've lost count,' Finkelstein told Lassin. Questions: Finkelstein knows that among the congratulations her sister will receive on her engagement, she will receive just as many questions about when she's going to get married and start a family . Completely Happy: Finkelstein is 'completely happy, independent, and successful' and the funny photo celebrates Finkelstein's confidence and contentment . Though the photo illustrates Finkelstein's sentiments about the wave of questions she's bound to be asked, Lassin writes that the DJ is, of course, genuinely happy for her younger sister. 'Most of all, it shows her terrific sense of humor,' Lassin wrote. 'In fact she told her father that her birthday gift to him is his not having to pay for her wedding this year.' Lassin said that the four sisters, her friends, are very close-knit and live just minutes from one another. The sisters, ranging in age from 26 to 32, all socialize together, and are rarely seen without one another, the blogger writes. Lassin noted that Finkelstein is 'completely happy, independent, and successful.'

"Edward Brooke, the  first African-American to be popularly . elected to the U.S. Senate, has died. Brooke, 95, was elected to Congress in 1966 by Republican voters in . Massachusetts at a time when the nation was gripped by racial . unrest. There had been two black senators shortly after the Civil War . but they were picked by . state legislatures and not by popular vote - a system which prevailed until the early 20th century. Edward Brooke, the MassachusettsRepublican who was the first African-American to be popularly elected to the U.S. Senate, died on Saturday . Brooke was one of just  nine black people who have ever served in that branch - including Barack Obama. On Saturday, he died of natural causes at home in Coral Gables, Florida, surrounded by his family. A revered politician known for his honesty, Brooke triumphed as a Republican in a typically Democrat state. He was serving as the Massachusetts attorney general when hewas elected to the U.S. Senate, where he spent 12 years. Among his notable actions, Brooke was the first Republican senator to publicly urge President Nixon to resign. After Obama's election, Brooke said he was 'thankful to God' that he had lived to see the historical milestone. Months later, the president was on stage to see Brooke receive the Congressional Gold Medal - the highest award Congress has to honor civilians. Tributes have flooded in from all corners of the political world. Brooke, 95, was elected to Congress in 1966 by voters inMassachusetts at a time when the nation was gripped in racialunrest (pictured in 1964) Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recalled his first impression of the newly elected senator when McConnell was a Senate staffer and described Brooke as 'a model of courage and honesty in office.' '... even from across the Senate chamber, you could sense that this was a Senator of historic importance,' the Kentucky Republican said in a statement Saturday. 'Indeed, he was.' Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick, the state's first black governor, remembered Brooke for his unselfish public service. 'He carried the added honor and burden of being 'the first' and did so with distinction and grace,' Patrick said. 'I have lost a friend and mentor. America has lost a superb example of selfless service.' He earned a name for himself by creating the Brooke amendment: the federal housing act, passed in 1969, which limited to 25 percent the amount of income a family must pay for rent in public housing. However, late in his second term, Brooke divorced his wife of 31 years, Remigia, in a stormy proceeding that attracted national attention. Repercussions from the case spurred an investigation into his personal finances by the Senate Ethics Committee and a probe by the state welfare department and ultimately cost him the 1978 election. He was defeated by Democrat Rep. Paul E. Tsongas. Tsongas' widow, U.S. Rep. Nikki Tsongas, said Saturday that Brooke's career was 'as courageous as it was historic.' In a Boston Globe interview in 2000, Brooke recalled the pain of losing his bid for a third term. 'It was just a divorce case. It was never about my work in the Senate. There was never a charge that I committed a crime, or even nearly committed a crime,' Brooke said. In 2008, pioneering newswoman Barbara Walters said she had an affair with the then-married Brooke in the 1970s, but it ended before he lost the 1978 election. She called him 'exciting' and 'brilliant.' Brooke received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a White House ceremony in 2004. Five years later, Brooke received the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award Congress has to honor civilians. He cited then the issues facing Congress - health care, the economy and the wars overseas - and called on lawmakers to put their partisan differences aside. 'We've got to get together,' Brooke said, turning his eyes to Senate GOP Leader McConnell. 'We have no alternative. There's nothing left. It's time for politics to be put aside on the back burner.' As Brooke sought the Senate seat in 1966, profiles in the national media reminded readers that he had won office handily in a state where blacks made up just 2 percent of the population - the state that had also given the nation its only Roman Catholic president, John F. Kennedy. He beat Democrat Endicott Peabody, a former governor who also supported civil rights, by a 3-to-2 margin despite predictions of a 'white backlash' against him. Commenting on Brooke's election and other developments that day, Martin Luther King Jr. said that 'despite appeals to bigotry of an intensity and vulgarity never before witnessed in the North, millions of white voters remained unshaken in their commitment to decency.' Brooke had parlayed his probes of local corruption into a successful run for state attorney general in 1962 when he became the highest ranking black elected official in the nation. He won re-election as attorney general in 1964 even though Democrats dominated other races. Somewhat aloof from the civil rights movement of the 1960s, especially the militant wing, he said blacks had to win allies, not fight adversaries. But he also said of civil rights leaders: 'Thank God we have them. But everyone has to do it in the best way he can.' He had refused to endorse Sen. Barry Goldwater for president in 1964, commenting later, 'You can't say the Negro left the Republican Party; the Negro feels he was evicted from the Republican Party.' The son of a Veterans Administration lawyer, Brooke was raised in a middle-class black section of Washington, attending segregated schools through his graduation from Howard University in 1941. He served in an all-black combat unit in World War II, and later settled in Boston after graduating from Boston University Law School. Brooke was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002 and went public the following year, saying he wanted to encourage men to perform self-examinations and advocating that insurance companies cover male mammograms. Brooke is survived by his second wife, Anne Fleming Brooke; their son Edward Brooke IV; his daughters from his first marriage, Remi Goldstone and Edwina Petit; stepdaughter Melanie Laflamme, and four grandchildren.","The Massachusetts Republican was elected to Congress in 1966 by voters .

"Britain's first surrogate mother said she felt 'heartbroken' and 'cheated' after handing over a baby girl she gave birth to 30 years ago today to a couple she never met. Kim Cotton was paid £6,500 to have a baby for an infertile Swedish couple on January 4, 1985, in an arrangement brokered through an American agency. The mother-of-two agreed to become a surrogate having never met the pair and they have remained anonymous ever since, along with the daughter she conceived for them. Britain's first surrogate mother Kim Cotton (pictured) said she felt 'heartbroken' and 'cheated' after handing over a baby girl she gave birth to 30 years ago today to a couple she never met . Mrs Cotton, 58, has admitted she was 'naive' to have entered the arrangement and described the way she was treated by the US agency as 'truly abhorrent'. The case prompted surrogacy to be regulated in the UK, as companies were banned from brokering deals between couples and potential mothers for profit. Mrs Cotton said: 'I always have mixed emotions on Baby Cotton's birthday. It's a funny, wistful feeling. 'I feel very cheated I never met her parents. The joy of handing a child over and seeing the joy on their faces....I had nothing. That's the sad part. There's always that regret.' Mrs Cotton, who used her own egg to conceive the child and the sperm of a man whose wife was infertile, was forced to leave the baby in hospital after she was made a ward of court. 'It was absolutely shocking,' she said. 'It's a feeling I can't put into words. I was heart-broken. 'I put it in a box, shut it and rarely open it. Some things are too painful. I think how naive I was.' Mrs Cotton, now a grandmother-of-five, agreed in her contract not to contact Baby Cotton after she was adopted by the couple. She said: 'I always felt that if she wanted to find me, I'm well known enough and there is Facebook and social media. It would be lovely. 'When I signed the contact, I said I would not go chasing after her. She might not know she's a surrogate. I just don't want to rock the boat.' Kim Cotton was paid £6,500 to have a baby for an infertile Swedish couple on January 4, 1985, in an arrangement brokered through an American agency . Asked whether she had any regrets about the surrogacy, she replied: 'None. 'I still think it's a wonderful thing to do. She's there because of me and my sacrifice. 'Surrogacy is very empowering. It's a wonderful, fulfilling feeling to bring a life in to the world. 'You can never have regrets about achieving that.' Mrs Cotton, who now lives in Milton Keynes with her husband Geoffrey, set up the support group Childlessness Overcome Through Surrogacy (Cots) in 1988. In 1991, she carried twins for an infertile friend. While there have been more than 980 surrogate births in the UK, Mrs Cotton believes the £12-15,000 expenses payments for surrogate mothers is 'a pittance' and not enough to attract more volunteers to cover the current shortfall. She has called for a more formal support network for surrogate mothers and a change to the system which currently means couples must obtain a Parental Order to be regarded as the surrogate baby's legal parents, rather than the natural mother. 'There's a massive challenge of getting people to volunteer,' she said. 'I don't know what puts people off. It may be there's a lack of knowledge. 'Three decades on, there is still such ignorance surrounding surrogacy even though the majority of IVF units now offer IVF host surrogacy treatment as normal practice. 'British law is so slow moving that it's often years behind advances in medical science. Infertility is a growing problem. People need help having children nowadays.'","Kim Cotton was paid £6,500 to have a baby for an infertile Swedish couple .

"Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah is suffering from pneumonia and temporarily needed help to breath through a tube, it has emerged. The 90-year-old had been transferred to a military hospital in the capital Riyadh earlier this week after experiencing shortness of breath and back pain. At one point he needed help to breath through a tube - but the procedure was successful and his condition is stable. Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah (pictured in June) is suffering from pneumonia and temporarily needed help to breath through a tube, it has emerged . The Saudi Royal Court said in a statement: 'It became apparent that there was a lung infection that required the insertion of a tube to aid with breathing on a temporary basis this evening.' The procedure had resulted in 'stability and success,' it added. After spending a little more than week at his royal encampment in Rawdat Khuraim, a green oasis about 62 miles (100 kilometers) north of Riyadh, the king returned to the capital on Wednesday and was admitted initially to a National Guard hospital for medical tests. A Saudi source familiar with the affairs of the royal family said the king would most likely stay in hospital for another week. The health of the monarch is of extreme importance in the kingdom, where Abdullah holds absolute powers to enact laws and appoint ministers. His condition is also watched internationally largely due to the country's role as one of the world's largest oil exporters, as well as regionally where the kingdom has used its influence to counter the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood group and Shiite Iran. The 90-year-old (pictured) had been transferred to a military hospital in the capital Riyadh earlier this week after experiencing shortness of breath and back pain . Abdullah officially assumed the throne in 2005, but has largely been seen as the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia since the mid-1990s. He reportedly underwent back surgeries in 2010 in New York City, and in October 2011 and November 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The aging monarch met President Barack Obama in March and appeared before the press wearing an oxygen tube. Official photographs of the king have also shown him in a wheelchair. His successor is 79-year-old half-brother Crown Prince Salman. Abdullah has outlived two other half-brothers who held the crown prince post. In an effort to ease concerns about continuity and stability in the kingdom, 69-year-old Prince Muqrin was appointed deputy crown prince and second-in-line to the throne last year. He is the youngest surviving son of Saudi Arabia's founder, King Abdulaziz Al Saud.","The 90-year-old monarch temporarily needed help to breath through a tube .

"There are fears the number of homes lost in bushfires burning across the Adelaide Hills could top 30 as firefighters battle to contain the blazes before hot weather grips the state again on Wednesday. A watch and act alert is active for the Sampson Flat bushfire, in the Mount Lofty ranges, which has been burning since Friday, and has claimed almost 13,000 hectares of scrub and farmland. The fire front is continuing to pose a risk to properties. An initial tally indicates at least a dozen homes have been lost and South Australia's premier says another 20 are likely to have been lost in the inferno. Scroll down for video . A South Australian fire burning in the Adelaide Hills - spanning kilometres - has destroyed 12 homes, Premier Jay Weatherill has confirmed . Mr Weatherill also confirmed on Sunday another 20 homes were also under threat in the area on the Mount Lofty Ranges . At one stage on Saturday evening, the smoke on the Adelaide Hills was so dense visibility was virtually nil . A burnt out house as fires continue to burn through Kersbrook on Sunday.

'We did fear that a further 20 may have been lost and we'll know by the middle of the day the actual numbers,' Premier Jay Weatherill told Channel 9 on Monday. 'But of course we do know that kennels housing people's pets have been lost and that is obviously a massive tragedy for people. 'Stock losses are likely to be considerable and sadly there will be homes that will have been lost. 'We want to know exactly where they are so that we can communicate with people before they have to go and see that for themselves.' Widespread road closures remain in place around the Sampson Flat area. Fire crews are also working to contain the blaze to within its general perimeter ahead of a return of hot weather. The mercury is forecast to hit 34 degrees Celsius in Adelaide on Monday before surging to 38 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. 'This is by no means over,' Mr Weatherill also told the ABC on Monday. 'We're really racing against time to try to make sure that we get as much of this contained before the hotter weather and the stronger winds are expected later in the week.' South Australia is enduring the state's worst fire conditions since the Ash Wednesday blaze in 1983, in which 28 people died in SA. On Sunday, two elderly people -a man from Kersbrook and a woman from Cudlee Creek - were reported as possibly missing but were later located safe and well after seeking refuge from the fire. Meanwhile, a man was arrested at Tea Tree Gully on Sunday morning after he repeatedly tried to enter the fire control area. The 45-year-old, from Fairview Park, was arrested at North East Road and charged with failing to comply with a direction of an officer. He was bailed to appear in the Holden Hill Magistrates Court on February 3. No roads have yet been reopened as police say they will act immediately on advice from Country Fire Service when it is deemed safe to bring in the current traffic cordons and allow access to safer areas. The state Country Fire Service downgraded its emergency warning to a watch-and-act message on Sunday, but said the blaze continued to burn freely in all directions. Among the communities still considered at risk were those at One Tree Hill, Humbug Scrub, Mount Crawford, Kersbrook, Birdwood, Gumeracha, Kenton Valley, Cudlee Creek and Inglewood. The raging fires have significantly affected farms and other private land in the area, causing wide ranging damage to crops and livestock.

The Sampson Flat fire has been downgraded from the highest emergency level to a watch-and-act message but the blaze is still burning on several fronts. Above is a road in Kersbrook . A property owner drives around his acreage to survey the damage of the bushfires near Kersbrook . The chief veterinary Officer at PIRSA, Dr Roger Paskin, is urging residents in the area who have affected livestock should carefully assess those livestock for burns and injuries after the fire front has passed and is safe to do so. He added that the first action for landowners with injured livestock is to contact their local vet and get them to inspect any livestock that have been injured by fire or smoke. 'Owners are in the first instance responsible for the welfare of livestock and for their treatment and first aid. 'If a veterinarian is not available landowners can contact the Stock Assessment Hotline at PIRSA whose staff can assist with advice on welfare issues and how to treat injured animals', Dr Paskin said. 'In addition to arranging veterinary help, owners should provide surviving livestock with access to good quality clean water, suitable fodder and shade if possible. 'Further, animals recovering from burns should be placed in a separate paddock or yard where they can be easily accessed, inspected regularly and nursed well.'

With hot and windy conditions easing on Sunday, the CFS will focus on containing the perimeter of the fire and clearing roads to allow people to return to their homes . At one stage on Saturday evening, the smoke on the Adelaide Hills - 26 kilometres east of the city's CBD - was so dense visibility was virtually nil. Premier Jay Weatherill offered his support to those affected. The government is offering emergency relief grants of $700 to people who have been affected by the fire and need short-term assistance. 'This is obviously enormously distressing to the people concerned,' the premier said. 'We'll make every effort to contact those people. 'We will be reopening areas once it's safe to do so, however there remains serious risks associated with falling trees and falling power lines.' The Country Fire Service says 22 firefighters have been injured in the blaze, but none seriously, and one fire truck destroyed. On Sunday, more than 400 firefighters, 80 fire trucks and 14 aircraft continued to work on the blaze. In Victoria, storms brought a brief respite to firefighters battling blazes across the state, but not before a blaze at Moyston, in the state's west, ­destroyed three homes, killed thousands of animals and burnt 4,700 hectares of land. Mr Weatherill said it was vital for authorities to contain the fire's active edges in the cooler weather, with another hot day forecast for Wednesday . Ground and air crews continued to work on the blaze on Sunday with more than 400 firefighters, 80 fire trucks and 14 aircraft involved . An emergency warning had been put out for Hastings, Bittern and Crib Point on the Mornington Peninsula, but the CFA said these fires are now under control. Bittern evacuee Barbara Tipper said the roads were jammed as residents fled the fire. 'It was getting pretty scary,' she told ABC 24. 'There's lots of smoke and we have no hope if a fire gets in here.' About 40 dogs and cats have perished after a bushfire destroyed large parts of a boarding kennel and cattery in the Adelaide foothills. Fire ripped through the Tea Tree Gully Boarding Kennels and Cattery on Saturday morning, burning down the cattery and a large section of the kennels. All of the cats and about a third of the dogs at the kennels were killed. Owner Paul Hicks says he and his wife were unable to take any of the animals with them when the fire forced them to evacuate. The devastated couple's home was also destroyed in the blaze. 'It's really, really sad at the moment,' Mr Hicks told ABC radio. 'We're trying to come to terms with what's happened with us and think about what we do going forward. 'It's my wife's passion. She loved the animals and she loved the customers.'

"A heavily-tattooed man with an inked eyeball has been jailed for 22 years for attempted murder and other offenses after shooting at police officers who were investigating a string of burglaries in Alaska. Jason Barnum, 39, who is nicknamed 'Eyeball', went on a crime spree that involved stealing cars and burglarizing homes to feed his heroin addiction, before driving to Merrill Field Inn in Anchorage. But while he was at the motel, officers noticed a vehicle linked to the burglaries in the parking lot and went to Barnum's room to investigate, at which point the criminal opened fire from the bathroom. Two officers shot back, hitting Barnum - whose face is covered with skulls and skeletons, lips are rimmed with skeletal teeth and right eyeball is tattooed black - in the right arm, before arresting him. Scroll down for video . Imprisoned: Jason Barnum, 39 (pictured in court on Friday), has been jailed for 22 years for attempted murder and other offenses after shooting at police officers who were investigating a string of burglaries in Alaska . Terrifying: Barnum (pictured, left, with his attorney at Anchorage Superior Court on Friday) went on a crime spree that saw him steal cars and burglarize homes to feed his heroin addiction, before driving to a motel . Criminal: But while he was at the motel, officers noticed a car linked to the burglaries  and went to Barnum's room, at which point he opened fire. Above, Barnum in an online photo (left) and at court in 2012 (right) Although a deputy was injured in the 2012 attack when a bullet slipped down the back of his vest, he reportedly returned to work several days later after receiving a number of stitches. On Friday, Barnum pleaded guilty to attempted murder, a consolidated first-degree burglary charge and third-degree weapons misconduct, according to the Alaska Dispatch. During the hearing, he reportedly acknowledged the  dangerous lifestyle choices that had led him to commit his crimes, saying: 'I tried man... I apologize to the folks who are hurt from this.' He was sentenced to 22 years behind bars at Anchorage Superior Court, deputy district attorney Clint Campion, said. The attempted-murder charge carried the most severe penalty of 20 years. Stretchered away: Two officers shot back at Barnum hitting the criminal in the right arm, before arresting him. Although a deputy was injured (pictured) in the 2012 attack, he reportedly returned to work several days later . Scene: The shooting occurred at Merrill Field Inn (pictured) in Anchorage in September 2012. No-one died . No longer free: During an investigation, police found that Barnum - who is seen on Facebook posing alongside a dog on a snowy mountain (above) and wearing a cross necklace- was likely high during the shooting . During an investigation, police found that Barnum - who is pictured on Facebook wearing an iron cross necklace that features a swastika in the middle - was likely high during the shooting. Following the incident near Merril Field airport in September 2012, the offender engaged police a two-hour standoff which eventually culminated in his arrest on 33 criminal counts, KTUU reported. He later admitted to vehicle theft and burglary, citing heroin addiction as his motive for the crimes. Alarmingly, most of the burglaries occurred when residents were in their homes. 'When you go into people's homes at night, that’s risky behavior and not normal for burglars,' Lt. Anthony Henry said. Previous appearance: On Friday, Barnum pleaded guilty to attempted murder, a consolidated first-degree burglary charge and third-degree weapons misconduct. Above, Barnum during a previous court appearance . In 2012, Barnum's bail was set at $500,000 by a district judge. He has remained jail since then. Speaking to the newspaper, Mr Campion said he was satisfied with Barnum's sentence - but added that if the case had gone to trial, the criminal may have been jailed for longer.

"Nicole McDonough, 32, is charged with second-degree official misconduct . A New Jersey attorney says it was 'not a crime' for his client, a married high school teacher, to have sex with an 18-year-old student student. English teacher Nicole McDonough, 32, was arrested Tuesday on a charge of second-degree official misconduct for an alleged sexual relationship with an 18-year-old male student at West Morris Mendham High School. The married mother-of-two, who is on her seventh year as a teacher, was placed on paid leave and has been released on $75,000 bail. Attorney Timothy Smith says the case against his client is 'legally and factually flawed' and that she will be proven innocent, NJ.com reported. 'I don't think she did [it], but if she did, it's not a crime,' he told the news website. The student attended West Morris Mendham High School, where McDonough, a married mother of two, works as an English teacher . Earlier this year, Smith represented 36-year-old teacher Adrian McConney, who was also charged with a similar crime but saw the case dropped. The judge ruled the relationship was not unlawful and the official misconduct charge would not stand. Smith hopes to get to a similar resolution with McDonough's case. 'This prosecution is obviously based on someone's belief as to what the law should be, as opposed to what it is,' he told NJ.com. 'When justice is served, it will be Nicole's integrity, and not the integrity of those who over-zealously persecuted her, that will be preserved.' Morris County prosecutors say McDonough and an unnamed student at her school had sex between May 31 and June 2. The complaint did not elaborate on details or disclose if the 18-year-old was one of her students. McDonough's attorney says it was 'not a crime' for her to have sex with one of the school's students because he was already 18-years-old . McDonough, of Mount Olive, New Jersey, teaches honors and International Baccalaureate-level English courses. She graduated from the College of St. Elizabeth with a bachelor's degree in English literature. On her page at the school's website, which has since been removed, McDonough writes: 'Although teaching is one of my many passions, I am also a mom, a personal trainer, and a cross-fitter. 'I am a mother of two amazing girls. We also have a puggle named Tegan.' 'The classroom is one of my many loves and I am excited to return to start a full year of school!'","Nicole McDonough of Mount Olive, New Jersey, was arrested on a charge or second-degree charge of official misconduct .

"Iran is facing a female drug-abuse crisis as the number of young, well-off and well-educated women using substances continues to rise. At least six million of Iran's 77.7 million population have drug related problems, according to official reports. And addiction, especially to Shisheh - a high-purity form of crystalline methamphetamine - is increasingly spreading across all social classes. Drug problem: Iran is facing a female drug-abuse crisis as the number of young, well-off and well-educated women using substances continues to rise. Above, women pictured in a drug rehabilation clinic in Tehran . The substance has become the second most popular drug after opium among young people seeking an escape from social and economic hardship, the Financial Times reports. Opium smoking in Iran dates back to at least the 17th century, and the the country has one of the highest rates of opiate addiction in the world. This has been blamed on the country being a popular trafficking route for dealers transporting drugs from Afghanistan to Europe. Iran's problem was first exposed in 2011, according to Zahra Bonianian, an adviser to the state-run Drug Control Headquarters for women and family affairs. History: Opium smoking in Iran dates back to at least the 17th century, and the the country has one of the highest rates of opiate addiction in the world (capital city Tehran, above) Speaking to the Financial Times, she said: 'It was when we realised that the number of married female addicts was going up, the age of addiction going down while the educational level [of addicts] was high.' She believes the government needs to place higher focus on protecting women from becoming addicts. The rise in drug abuse has been attributed to the social development that Iran has experienced as a result of the internet, social media and globalisation. A new generation of young adults reject a strict Islamic way of life which many of their parents conformed to - instead emulating modern behavioural norms of the West. In recent years, marriage and birth rates in Iran have fallen while the number of divorces is on the rise. At the same time, the Islamic government has improved female access to higher education, and women  now account for more than 60 per cent of graduates. But many find themselves caught between a growing sense of freedom and increasing educational opportunities - and the conservative values of older generations. Amir-Hossein Yazdani, a professor of psychology, said: 'Girls and boys under 25 years old largely enjoy equal freedom in terms of social and educational activities, but girls have a more gloomy perspective, [seeing] more responsibilities ahead.' He said highly educated girls 'do not enjoy equal job opportunities, or they feel under pressure to behave like a traditional woman - this is fanning fresh tendencies to addiction'. A woman called Mahsa is typical of this trend. After graduating from a respected high school she was forced to marry at 18. She has since become divorced and took solace in taking drugs. Despite studying psychology at university she ended up in a Tehran addiction treatment centre last year with a drug habit  costing her £24 a day. The Iranian government is said to be extremely concerned by the growing levels of drug addiction. The latest official figures suggest the number of female addicts has nearly doubled since in the last eight years. Women now make up 9.3 per cent of Iranians affected. More than 50 per cent of addicted women used drugs for the first time between the ages of 15 and 19. Some experts argue this is because women have been seen as a lower priority than men because they make up fewer than ten per cent of Iran’s addicts.

"Channel 4 has caused outrage by commissioning a 'Shameless-style' comedy series based on the Irish potato famine - a tragedy in which more than a million people died. The sitcom, called Hungry, was recently revealed by Dublin-based screenwriter Hugh Travers but has been met with strong opposition - with thousands signing a petition to prevent the show being aired. Some say the show's comical stance is an insult to those who died and that the Irish potato famine is 'no laughing matter' and should only be shown in an historical context. Scroll down for video . Irish potato famine: More than one million died when the potato crop was hit by disease in the mid 19th century . Writer Mr Travers told the Irish Times: 'They say comedy equals tragedy plus time. 'I don't want to do anything that denies the suffering that people went through, but Ireland has always been good at black humour. 'We're kind of thinking of it as Shameless in famine Ireland.' Shameless was a Channel 4 hit comedy about a dysfunctional family living in a Manchester council estate riddled with alcohol and drug abuse. Period: 1845-1849 . Cause: Late blight - a disease that destroys both the leaves and the edible roots of the potato plant. Late blight: Caused by water mold . Significance: It was the worst famine to occur in Europe in the 19th century. Deaths: More than 1million people . Emigrated: Around two million people . By the early 1840s, almost one-half of the Irish population - but primarily the rural poor - had come to depend almost exclusively on the potato for their diet, and the rest of the population also consumed it in large quantities. A heavy reliance on just one or two high-yielding varieties of potato greatly reduced the genetic variety that ordinarily prevents the decimation of an entire crop by disease. Source: Encyclopaedia Britannica . The Great Famine lasted from 1845 until 1849 when Ireland formed part of the British Empire. One eight of the population died in the four-year period and two million people were forced to emigrate. The TV project has been heavily criticised in Ireland before even being aired - with one Dublin councillor claiming the show was intended to 'embarrass and denigrate' one of the most tragic periods in Irish history. Speaking to The Independent, David McGuinness added: 'Jewish people would never endorse making a comedy of the mass extermination of their ancestors at the hands of the Nazis. 'The people of Somalia, Ethiopia or Sudan would never accept the plight of their people, through generational famine, being the source of humour in Britain. 'I am not surprised that it is a British television outlet funding this venture.' Anger: Dublin councillor David McGuinness has heavily criticised the show's premise . The councillor is calling on Irish broadcasters to reject the project. Hugh Travers, who is best-known for the award-winning Irish radio drama Lambo, said that the broadcasters had given him an 'open commission' - meaning he could write about anything he wanted. So far more than 9,000 people have signed an online petition on change.org to prevent the show from being aired. The petition reads: 'Famine or genocide is no laughing matter, approximately one million Irish people died and another two million were forced to emigrate because they were starving. 'Any programme on this issue would have to be of serious historical context... not a comedy.' Twitter users have also weighed into the argument, with one, James Foran, calling the show 'unbelievably crass and insensitive'. But not everyone is critical of the concept. Another Twitter user, Ryan Cullen, posted: 'No concept should be censored for art...wait until you see how's it's presented and what its intent is.' He adds: 'Same people complaining about Channel 4 making a sitcom about famine are same complaining about 'The Interview' being pulled. Hypocrites.' A Channel 4 spokesman said 'We have commissioned a script set in 19th century Ireland by Dublin-based writer Hugh Travers and Irish-based production company Deadpan Pictures - however this in the development process and is not currently planned to air.' Outrage: Many Twitter users have reacted angrily to the the proposal of a comedy based on the potato famine . So far more than 9,000 people have signed an online petition to prevent Hungry from being aired by Channel 4 . Defence: There were a few who defended the idea of the programme on social media .

"We like to think of ourselves as the superior species. But robots are learning to cook like humans - by watching YouTube videos. In a sign of the times, researchers have found a way to teach robots how to use cooking tools. Scroll down for video . Robots were taught to cook as part of an impressive use of artificial intelligence called 'deep learning' Tutorials: Researchers used a video by YouTube cook 'Laura in the Kitchen' to teach the robots how to cook . Actions: Researchers used convolutional neural networks to help the robots identify the way a hand grasps an item, like a spatula, seen here, . The researchers from the University of Maryland and the Australian research center NICTA, have published a paper on their findings. Their work is part of an impressive use of artificial intelligence called 'deep learning.' Deep learning involves researchers using training systems called artificial neural networks on lots of information derived from audio, images, and other inputs. In order to train the robots, researchers selected data from 88 YouTube videos of people cooking, according to Venture Beat. A 'special' robot chef cuts noodles in a restaurant's kitchen in Jilin, China, the sight of a robot cooking a meal could soon become a common occurence . From there, the researchers generated commands that a robot could then execute. The researchers employed 'convolutional neural networks' which are now in use at Facebook, among other companies. They used these networks to identify the way a hand is grasping an item, and to recognize specific objects. Their system was also able to anticipate the action involving an object and a hand. According to technology experts, they presented the systems with new information and received inferences about it in response. The results from the study will be revealed later this month at the 29th annual conference of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. Ultimately, researchers hope their results may signal the start of a training program which will allow robots to be able to seek their own sources of information. A spokesman for the researchers said: 'We believe this preliminary integrated system raises hope towards a fully intelligent robot for manipulation tasks that can automatically enrich its own knowledge resource by 'watching' recordings from the World Wide Web.' Convolutional neural networks were introduced in a 1980 paper by Kunihiko Fukushima. The design of convolutional neural networks follows the discovery of visual mechanisms in living organisms. In our brain, the visual cortex contains lots of cells and it is these cells which are responsible for detecting light in small, overlapping sub-regions of the visual field, called receptive fields. These cells act as local filters over the input space and the more complex cells have larger receptive fields. A convolution operator is created to mimic and perform the same function by all of these cells. The networks were inspired by biological processes and are widely used models for image and video recognition, being a power tool for different vision problems.","Research was carried out by the University of Maryland and NICTA .

"The increasing popularity of dating apps on mobile phones has fuelled a surge in cases of sexually transmitted diseases, say doctors. Tinder and other match-making firms have proved explosively popular, especially among those in their 20s and 30s, providing users with lists of potential sexual partners nearby. But sexual health experts say 'hook-up' apps are leading to rises in sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Scroll down for video . Rates of sexually transmitted diseases have increased along with the rise of 'hook-up' apps, file photo . Free services such as Tinder allow users to meet up with like-minded adults to have casual sex . Gonorrhoea cases in England jumped 15 per cent between 2012 and 2013, according to official figures, from 25,577 to 29,291. Syphilis cases went up nine per cent, from 2,981 to 3,249. Peter Greenhouse, of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said: 'You don't have to be a genius to work out that these sorts of apps make having casual sex a damn sight easier. 'You can find, down to a metre or two, the nearest available person who is interested. This is something that just hasn't been available before.' Millions now use Tinder, which lets users connect via their phones if they 'like' each other's picture. Advocates say it works because it is spontaneous and discreet, but critics believe it is making casual sex more normal. An app called Grindr is equally popular among gay men. Mr Greenhouse said: 'Thanks to Grindr or Tinder, you can acquire chlamydia in five minutes.' Chlamydia can cause infertility in women, though most clear it naturally. Gonorrhoea can cause infertility but needs antibiotics to clear it. Doctors are worried by a rise in antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea. Syphilis can lead to blindness, brain damage and even death if left untreated. Experts at Public Health England found such apps had a role in six outbreaks of syphilis across Britain since 2012. They were enabling 'hyper-efficient transmission' of infections, Dr Ian Simms of Public Health England told New Scientist magazine. Outbreaks that would once have been confined to one area were spreading to other towns and cities, he said. The companies behind these apps argue no firm evidence yet exists to link them to rises in STIs. But a spokesman for Public Health England said: 'The only way to get protection from STIs is to practise safer sex.'","So-called 'hook-up' apps are being blamed for an increase in sex diseases .

"Michael Schumacher is crying at the sound of his children's voices after starting to recognise faces showing that he is 'alive and understands', according to reports. The seven-time Formula One world champion, who is making a 'long, slow recovery' after a skiing accident, apparently cries when he hears a known sound, including the voices of his wife Corinna, daughter Gina Maria and son Mick. The news comes one year after his accident in the French Alps and as his family prepare to mark his 46th birthday at their home in Gland, Switzerland, where he has been recovering since June. Scroll down for video . Michael Schumacher is crying at the sound of his children's voices, including his son Mick (right), showing that he is 'alive and understands', according to reports . The seven-time Formula One world champion, who is making a 'long, slow recovery' after a skiing accident, apparently cries when he hears a known sound. Pictured: With his daughter Gina Maria when she was little . According to an article in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra, the fact Schumacher is reacting with tears to his loved ones' voices is 'valuable news', after a year of seeming 'really far away'. Writing in the paper, Giorgio Terruzi said: 'Schumi cries. And sometimes mysteriously. He cries when he hears his children, his wife's voice, his dogs. In the silence of that room, a tear runs down his thin face at a known sound.' He added: 'Inside this we can find... There is life, enclosed in a drop; there is the strength of a man who is moved and that moves each of us. We have his tears, his senses exposed.' Schumacher suffered severe head injuries while skiing with his family in the French Alps on December 29, 2013. The accident left him with brain damage and he was in a coma for six months. Over the past year, Schumacher's family have released little information about his condition, describing only a 'long and difficult road' to recovery. But Terruzi's comments appear to have been supported by Autosprint's editor-in-chief Alberto Sabbatini, who also wrote in an editorial that Schumacher was making a 'very slow recovery'. However, he warned that, while Schumacher has his eyes open, he is often looking 'into the void'. 'In recent times, he has been able to recognise the familiar faces of his family, but he cannot communicate with them,' he said.

An Italian journalist said it shows his senses are 'exposed' Schumacher's wife Corinna with their daughter Gina Maria, now 16, in 2000 (left) and Schumacher with his two children on a beach in 2003 (right) Referring to the reports about Schumacher crying at certain sounds, he said: 'It shows that he feels emotion. That his brain works. 'It is the only way his strong character is able to externally convey an emotion. It is a sign that he is alive and understands, even if for now he is the prisoner of an immobile body.' Last week, Philippe Streiff, another former F1 driver, told French media that Schumacher ‘has yet to recover the power of speech’ but is ‘nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him’. Streiff said he had learned of Schumacher's progress from his wife and his surgeon, Gerard Saillant. Schumacher is said to be paralysed and in a wheelchair. He cannot speak and has memory problems, according to the former racing driver. Road to recovery:  Michael Schumacher, pictured with his wife Corinna in Italy in 2004, has yet to recover the ability to speak, but is 'alive and understands' , a friend has claimed . But Schumacher's manager has disputed the comments, saying he faces a ‘long fight’ for recovery, and that Streiff is not a family friend. ‘We need a long time. It’s going to be a long time and a hard fight,’ Sabine Kehm said. Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, France, where he owns a chalet when the accident happened. He was skiing with his 14-year-old son on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers. But shortly after 11am, he left the piste and skied on to an off-piste area located in between the red run and a blue run, for beginners to intermediates. It was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock. He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. The footage recorded on a camera attached to his helmet was undamaged. The former driver skiing while staying in the Italian resort of Madonna Di Campiglio in January 2004 . Schumacher (second right) celebrates on the podium after his 2012 Formula One Grand Prix win in Valencia . The film, which included audio, captured the crash in full horror and was analysed by police who investigated the accident. Two months later, on February 17, the head of the inquiry Prosecutor Patrick Quincy closed the case. He announced that any criminal wrongdoing had been ruled out. He cleared the ski resort, stating that the piste had been marked correctly and that Schumacher 'deliberately' left the ski run. Schumacher was airlifted from the slopes minutes after the accident to Moutiers Hospital and was then transferred 80 miles west to CHU Grenoble, a larger hospital that specializes in head injuries. He arrived at 12.40pm and had been placed in an artificial coma. He was immediately operated on to relieve pressure on his brain. At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma. On April 4 Kehm revealed that he was showing 'moments of consciousness and awakening'. He had opened his eyes and had interaction, albeit minimal, with his environment. It was the first piece of positive news for months. In October, a French doctor treating Schumacher said that the 45-year-old was making progress, but will need years to fully recover. Ms Kehm has said it was 'very hard' for his loved ones to comprehend how the racing car driver could have been so catastrophically injured in such a 'banal situation'. Schumacher's wife Corinna was a constant presence at his bedside. She and Schumacher met in 1991 on the F1 circuit after she was previously married to racing driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen. With an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years . This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts.","The Formula One world champion cries when he hears a 'known sound'

"Thousands of people have once again leveled contempt at polarizing Texas cheerleader Kendall Jones over an online competition she set up to find the 'hottest' male hunter. The 19-year-old - who has been bombarded with death threats and hate from all over the world due to her proud Facebook posts about killing rare and exotic animals - said that she received over 3,000 submissions for the contest and personally decided upon an 'American Idol-style Top 12'. But it wasn't the nominees or even the winner - North Carolina's Trey Moore - that people cared about, and rather the fact Jones was once again celebrating the slaughter of animals in the name of sport. '(Applause) for the day your gun fails and the lion tears u apart,' one furious critic, Paul Norton, posted to Jones' Facebook page. Packing heat: Kendall Jones, 19, has only further incensed her detractors by starting up a search for the hottest hunter . 'Sick and ignorant': Critics say such a competition is nothing but a celebration of slaughtering animals for fun . Big game: Most of the nominees are seen pictured with the rare animals they have shot dead . Winner: Trey Moore, from North Carolina, was voted in as the winner of Hot Hunter 2014 . Kendall Jones wrote in announcing Trey Moore as winner: 'Congrats Trey and good luck hunting in 2015!!' Stiff competition: Over 3,000 men are said to have applied to be part of the search . Fair game: While some animals are common for hunting, like deer, others are more exotic . Hot hunters: Jones later revealed her real inspiration for starting the contest . Jones, a cheerleader at Texas Tech, claims her motivation for initiating the competition was to expose the sexism she has suffered. 'The real reason I did this whole competition was to prove that what really pisses off  the anti-hunting crowd is not that I hunt, or that I pose with my trophies, or that I'm proud of my achievements ... its the fact that I'm a girl and I'm doing those things,' she wrote. 'Well I'm here to tell you, I'm NEVER going to stop. 'I'm proud to hunt, proud to cheer, proud to wear makeup, and especially PROUD TO BE ME!' However this seemed to only further infuriate her detractors. Facebook user Calvin Fox wrote: 'Let's hunt you for your blonde locks they would look so much better on my head than yours!!' Jennifer Skean added: 'You may love your makeup but it doesn't hide the monster you are.' Bianca Dye wrote: 'You are DISGUSTING!' 'American Idol-style': Jones narrowed nominees down to this Top 12 . Hate: Scores of photos like this are being circulated online by critics of Jones, who they call a monster . While many flared up against Jones, others, many of whom said they were hunters, took a more diplomatic approach. 'I don't care the slightest bit that you're a women. I'm just an average guy who cares about the fact that you're just willing to kill an animal that just simply doesn't need to be killed,' wrote one man, Matt Phillips. 'I do understand that ppl r going to kill chickens, cows, and a few other things to keep our society flowing. I understand that hunting deer is acceptable. but do you really need to kill a lion/cheetah?' Another man, Rick Nally, took a similar approach, but was just as outraged. 'I am a hunter have been since I could tote a Daisy BB gun,' he wrote. 'I truly believe these people will have to answer to the man above for killing these beautiful creatures.....I was taught if you ain't going to eat it, don't shoot it, unless you are protecting yourself.....what warped pleasure would you get from killing these beautiful cats? or an elephant, rhino.....etc?' Chris Seilhamer added: 'I don't care that you hunt... but do it because you'll use the meat... not for pure sport. You're also killing endangered animals. You're not a hunter... you're an idiot and a complete douche for enticing people and being antagonistic.' Jones has long maintained that she is careful to only hunt in areas where it is legal and many of her pictures have been taken on safari trips in Africa. Her and her family claim to give the meat from their kill to local villages. Gone: Facebook has also removed this image of her with an elephant. It said it removes 'content that promotes poaching of endangered species... or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse' '[Roosevelt] . was a hunter too, right? He killed the same species that hunters now . chase today under a mound of anti-hunting pressure. 'Yet, . how can it be possible that someone can love the earth, and take from . the Earth in the name of conservation? For some folks, they'll never . understand. For the rest of us...we were born that way. God Bless . Teddy,' wrote Jones. Jones, whose Facebook indicates . she 'is looking to host a TV show in January 2015,' said here isn't . always space for threatened species like elephants or lions. 'Controlling the male lion population . is important within large fenced areas like these,' Jones writes. 'Funds . from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but . also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their . property.' Big 5: Jones says her first kill was a rare African white rhino, part of her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (rhino, elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard and lion) Legal: The young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she's doing is fine, since she pays the governments of African countries to kill the animals . Jones' photos showed her posing with bagged zebras, hugging a dead leopard, and smiling beside elephants she had killed. One . particular photo, in which she posed alongside an extremely . endangered rhinoceros, had her critics especially steaming, but the . Texas Tech cheerleader says it was alive and well. 'The . vet drew blood, took DNA samples, took body and head measurements, . treated a leg injury and administered antibiotics. I felt very lucky to . be part of such a great program and procedure that helps the White Rhino . population through conservation,' she wrote. However, . Jones has in her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (lion, . elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard, and White/Black rhinoceros) shot a . white rhino, which number around 20,000. Because . of her enthusiasm for killing rare game and what they say is her . dubious standing as a conservationist, some critics say Jones should be . banned from hunting in Africa completely. Pride: Jones learned how to hunt after she went with her father to Africa for his own hunts at age 9 . 'Cruelty': Critics say she is not . a conservationist and is simply trying to get a television deal with the pictures . Boasts: 'This time I got my leopard,' she wrote a safari when she was 14.  'And also took down a hippo' A second petition, this one on change.org and originating from South Africa, is hoping to do just that. 'Kendall .

It . continues: 'She has publicly stated that she hopes to have a television . hunting show and she is using endangered and helpless African animals as . a stepping to further her popularity on social media platforms.'

"He hasn't bought a new car in 14 years, doesn't go on overseas holidays and takes home just a fraction of the money he earns. Glastonbury Festival organiser Michael Eavis has revealed he takes a salary of just £60,000 a year, despite the event turning over more than £32million. Eavis, 79, says he's not interested in the money and donates £2m to charity each year after paying his staff's wages and event costs. Scroll down for video . Modest salary: Eavis (pictured) takes home £60,000 a year, despite the event turning over more than £32m . Wages: Eavis (left) earns less than his top dairy herdsman at Worthy Farm in Somerset. Here he is pictured at the farm with his daughter Emily (right) The father-of-five says his take-home pay is so modest that he earns less than his top dairy herdsman at Worthy Farm in Pilton, Somerset. He last bought a new car 14 years ago and does not holiday abroad, instead opting to stay at his holiday cottage in Cornwall. 'I suppose I am a lot better off than I would have been for sure, but I don't have millions or anything,' Mr Eavis told Western Daily Press. 'I get a wage of £60,000 but I pay more than that to my cowman. 'I am not going to buy a flashy car - I bought a Mini for my wife 14 years ago. 'I don't really like going on holiday - I just have a little cottage in Cornwall. 'There is no money stashed anywhere. 'We do a lot on the charity side - we aim for £2million a year.' Mr Eavis, who has overseen 32 festivals in the last 44 years, said he does not like to carry over any profit into the next year - and gives any excess cash away.

'Yesterday, the girls said there is a quarter of a million left over. 'I said let's get rid of it, send it on to the charity today.' The festival employs around 150 people full time throughout the year and 25,000 during the event. So far, Lionel Richie is the only name to be confirmed for the 2015 festival, which sold out in less than half an hour. Eavis said he felt his team had done well when it came to picking headliners. 'There are only 30 headliners in the world - people who can pull more than 60,000 people,' he added. 'We have had all but two of them at the moment.'

"Guarding the Ecuadorian embassy in London where Julian Assange has claimed asylum has now cost taxpayers  £9million, it has been revealed. Metropolitan Police officers have been standing outside the Knightsbridge building since the WikiLeaks founder took refuge there in June 2012 - a vigil costing £11,000 per day. The 43-year-old is wanted in Sweden after allegedly sexually assaulting two women in Stockholm in 2010. Scroll down for video . WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been at the Ecuadorian embassy in west London since June 2012 . British taxpayers have now spent £9m on guarding the embassy in Knightsbridge where Assange is staying . In November, a Swedish appeal court upheld the arrest warrant against the WikiLeaks founder. Mr Assange, who denies the allegations and has not been charged, has sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy to avoid extradition. If he goes to Sweden, he fears he could be extradited to the US to face charges of leaking government documents. WikiLeaks has published thousands of secret documents, which have enraged the White House and lifted the lid on diplomatic relations. Police officers stationed outside the embassy round the clock are under orders to arrest him if he tries to leave. At all times there are three Scotland Yard officers waiting outside the embassy. At least one stands on the steps and others will question visitors leaving in case it is Assange in disguise. Baroness Jenny Jones, deputy chair of the Police and Crime Committee at the London Assembly, told MailOnline: 'The policing bill for keeping one man holed up in an embassy has reached yet more ridiculous proportions. The Government has yet to explain why taxpayers have to pay for this. It's time to end the stalemate and stand down the officers.' Assange is wanted in Sweden after allegedly sexually assaulting two women in Stockholm in 2010 . The hacker has endured a self-imposed imprisonment in a single room after being given diplomatic asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy. Assange is still unapologetic about his role in helping to disclose government secrets. The embassy — strewn with red, yellow and blue Ecuadorian flags — takes up a single floor of a block behind Harrods. Initially, Assange slept on an inflatable mattress donated by embassy staff, who are described as having become 'like family' to him. But when it became clear his stay was not going to be temporary, a small room was transformed into his living quarters and a bed installed. In August, it was revealed he was suffering from arrhythmia, which is a form of irregular heartbeat, a chronic cough and high blood pressure because of his confinement to the air-conditioned interior of the embassy. WikiLeaks sources also said the lack of Vitamin D, which is produced by exposure to sunshine, was damaging his health and could lead to a host of conditions including asthma, diabetes, weak bones and even heightened risk of dementia. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'The estimated direct cost of policing the Ecuadorian embassy between June 2012 and the end of October 2014 is £7.3 million, of which £5.5 million is opportunity costs (Police Officer Pay costs that would be incurred in normal duties) and £1.8 million additional costs (estimated additional Police Overtime as a direct result of the deployments at the Ecuadorian embassy). 'The estimated full cost including indirect costs for the same period would be £9.0m. The costs provided are an estimate based on averages as actual salary and overtime costs will vary daily.' Andy Silvester from the Taxpayers Alliance said: 'Despite his legion of celebrity fans, Assange should be treated like any other accused criminal. 'The Government must redouble the pressure on the Ecuadorian authorities to bring this charade to an end, as there is little sign of progress and the bill climbs ever higher. The police have better things to do than a Knightsbridge vigil.' October 2006 – Assange sets up WikiLeaks for anonymous whistleblowers. April 2010 – WikiLeaks reveals a video called Collateral Murder, showing two US military teams shooting a group of men from Apache helicopters. Among those killed were two Reuters war correspondents. July 2010 – WikiLeaks releases US logs from the Afghan War, which includes civilian casualties and the names of alleged NATO informers. August 2010 - During a visit to Sweden a prosecutor orders Assange's arrest for rape and molestation, though this is terminated five days later. September 2010 – After reviewing the original claim, the investigation is renewed by Swedish prosecutors. Assange is arrested in his absence. October 2010 – Iraq War logs are released – the biggest single leak in US military history. November 2010 – A quarter of a million unclassified and confidential diplomatic cables are published  by WikiLeaks. US Attorney-General Eric Holder confirms there is 'an active, ongoing criminal investigation' into WikiLeaks. Swedish prosecutors issue an international warrant for Assange's arrest. December 2010 – US vice president Joe Biden dubs Assange a 'terrorist'. He is arrested by British police and later released on bail. February 2011 – A High Court in London approves Sweden's extradition request. April 2011 – WikiLeaks publishes files from Guantanamo Bay revealing details of detainees. November 2011 – High Court dismisses Assange's appeal against extradition. He takes it to the UK's Supreme Court. May 2012 – Supreme Court upholds the High Court's decision to surrender Assange to Sweden. June 2012 – Assange requests the appeal to be re-opened; Supreme Court rejects this request. Assange then seeks political asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. August 2012 – Ecuador grants Assange asylum, saying there are fears his human rights might be violated if he is extradited. August 2014 - Assange reveals plans to leave the embassy 'soon'. November 2014 - Sweden's Court of Appeal upholds the arrest warrant against Assange.","Julian Assange has claimed asylum at Ecuador embassy since June 2012 .

"It's set be the one of the biggest – and certainly one of the most hyped – cinema releases of 2015. But as anticipation of the latest instalment in the Star Wars saga intensifies, so too does the lucrative merchandising industry surrounding it, along with fears that fans are being exploited. Devotees of the sci-fi movies are already up in arms about a model of the Millennium Falcon spaceship, commanded by Harrison Ford’s character Han Solo, which is currently being advertised on TV. The model is built from a series of parts released every week along with a glossy magazine. Scroll down for video . Parents have complained that buying the Millennium Falcon will cost them an estimated £900 over two years . The first installment of the magazine costs £2.99 and then rises sharply to £8.99 for the next 100 editions . But the cost of completing the project is an astronomical £900 – a fact that hasn’t gone unnoticed by Star Wars fans. ‘For that you could just buy Harrison Ford,’ raged Josh Reynolds on Twitter. Fellow Twitter user Amanda Westwood added: ‘I’d want a ride on the real thing for that much.’ And John Holt said: ‘I bought my first car for less.’ The first issue of the Build The Millennium Falcon magazine costs £2.99, but then the price soars to £8.99, and publishers say there are at least 100 instalments, meaning it will take two years to build the spaceship. The cost of the magazines flashes up on TV screens for only a brief moment. Many parents are trapped into buying every edition by ‘pester power’. Nicola Lamond, from website Netmums, said: ‘Asking parents to pay almost £900 for a toy is luring them into the financial dark side. ‘Like a payday loan company glossing over its real APR, the true price is only displayed in tiny writing on the ads which parents may miss. And once they start buying, they are hooked in and committed to keep going or the family will be left with nothing but a few tiny sections of model for their money. ‘Even the most expensive Lego version of the Millennium Falcon is only about £100, so this version is a rip-off which mums and dads must avoid.’ The new Star Wars film, The Force Awakens, is due out in December and director J. J. Abrams has already raised anticipation by posting online photos of the new Millennium Falcon. However, the Build The Millennium Falcon project has not impressed model-maker Mike Lees, who has produced Star Wars-themed models for private clients. He said: ‘There is no reason to stretch the project over two years. The first few magazines are available at newsagents, but you need to subscribe to get the rest so you are tied in. To be honest, I would prefer the cheaper one from Argos.’ Dai Chetley, marketing director at DeAgostini UK, the firm behind the magazine, said: ‘We are sure that Star Wars fans and model makers will be delighted with it. It is a full-size model of the actual movie prop used in The Empire Strikes Back. ‘It needs 100 parts because it is a large and complex model. To be able to replicate the movie prop faithfully, we need that many.’","A magazine company is offering the chance to build the Millennium Falcon .

"With its magnificent stained-glass windows, it stands as a fitting memorial to the Battle of Britain pilots who gave their lives to save the nation from Nazi invasion. But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the ornately furnished chapel Sir Winston Churchill insisted should remain a 'permanent' shrine to the glorious Few is to be closed down and boarded up. Defying the wartime leader's express wishes, defence chiefs have decreed that the £50,000- a-year cost of running St George's Chapel of Remembrance is an 'inappropriate' use of resources. Scroll down for video . St George's Chapel, pictured,  is at the former RAF station at Biggin Hill in Kent, is threatened with closure . The names of the 544 men who died during the Battle of Britain are inscribed inside the chapel, pictured . Among those honoured in the chapel is Sergeant Pilot Leonard Stock who went missing in October 1941 . The decision was described last night as 'a sickening insult' to the memory of the 544 airmen killed in the pivotal battle, arguably the most important ever fought by Britain. St George's stands on the site of the former RAF station at Biggin Hill, Kent, from where Spitfire and Hurricane pilots took off in 1940 to repel Hitler's Luftwaffe. Inside, the names of those who died in the battle are inscribed on a roll of honour. It is these men and others who survived who inspired one of Churchill most famous speeches: 'Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.' The chapel is expected to attract 25,000 visitors this year, the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, but is scheduled to close in 2016 unless a benefactor can be found. It is expected that 25,000 people will visit the chapel this year on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain . Defence Minister Anna Soubry said it 'no longer provides support to an operational RAF station and as the number of serving RAF personnel using the chapel is very low, continued support to the chapel would be an inappropriate use of defence resources. My officials… have met with the local chaplaincy council to discuss the closure of the site'. Yet critics of the decision argue that thousands of people visit the chapel each year. Along with regular weekly services, commemorative services are held on Battle of Britain Sunday and Remembrance Sunday. More than 5,500 people have signed a petition on a Government website against the closure of St George's. Sir Winston took a personal interest in the fundraising drive that led to the chapel being built, and wrote to those who made donations, making clear his intention that St George's should stand as a 'permanent shrine of remembrance' to those who gave their lives, adding: 'We live to hold their reward inviolate and unfading.' Battle of Britain veteran Tom Neill, 94, described the closure as 'shameful' and 'a sickening insult to those who flew and lost their lives'. Mr Neill, a retired Wing Commander, said: 'The chapel is a priceless heirloom and it is being got rid of by sleight of hand. For these politicians and civil servants, this is just a stroke of a pen for them. 'They should remember the significance of the Battle of Britain. We show such contempt for the sacrifice of our veterans and our history.' An online petition has been set up to urge the Ministry of Defence not to abandon its support of the chapel, which has already attracted more than 6,300 supporters. Add your voice here. St George's was built to replace a military chapel which was destroyed by fire in 1946. It was previously threatened in 1989 when the MoD closed Biggin Hill as an operational base, but was granted a reprieve because of its 'historical importance'. Oak panels either side of the altar carry the names of hundreds of aircrew who died during the war and badges of 52 RAF squadrons which served at Biggin Hill. The wooden floor is made from propeller blades from wartime aircraft, while some windows are dedicated to individual pilots who were based at the site. Chapel custodian Laurie Chester said: 'There is so much history here. Given the sacrifices made in the war, I've considered it a privilege to look after the place.' A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'In order to ensure that the defence budget is spent in the most appropriate way the MOD will look to relinquish ownership of St George's Chapel by March 2016. However, given its importance, we are exploring options that will ensure the heritage of the chapel is preserved.' Some of the stained glass windows show the role played by those who supported the aircrew during the war .","MoD chiefs plan to close down St George's Chapel at Biggen Hill, Kent .

"Malta's prime minister Joseph Muscat has warned league leaders Hibernians their decision to offer a contract to Ched Evans risks damaging the country's reputation. But justice minister Owen Bonnici believes the convicted rapist deserves the chance to resume his football career having been released after serving half of a five-year prison sentence. Hibernians announced on Friday that they had offered a deal to the former Sheffield United and Wales striker for the remainder of the season. VIDEO Scroll down to see Ched Evans declare his determination to clear his name . Ex-Sheffield United striker Ched Evans is without a club after being released from prison in October . Malta prime minister Joseph Muscat has warned Hibernians about signing convicted rapist Evans . The 26-year-old had an offer to train with the Blades retracted in November following strong local opposition, while Tranmere, Oldham and Hartlepool also rejected the opportunity to sign him. While reports that Evans might sign with a club in England led to public outcry, club official Jeffrey Farrugia suggested there would be no such reaction in Malta. But a tweet on the verified Twitter account of Muscat's office read: 'Footballers are role models. Hibs decision will define them + to an extent Malta. I hope (management) understand this clearly before final decision.' Bonnici, though, feels Evans should be afforded the opportunity to resurrect his career. 'Ched Evans should be given a second chance. If we believe in rehabilitation of ex-prisoners we should practice what we preach,' Bonnici tweeted. Hibernians, 15 points clear at the top of the country's domestic league having dropped just two points in 16 games, confirmed on Friday they had made an offer to Evans. Club vice-president Stephen Vaughan said: 'We are looking to secure the services of a top striker and Ched fits the bill. 'We've spoken to his agent and have offered a deal from now until the end of the season.' Technical director Farrugia added on Sky News: 'Our vice-president has offered the contract until the end of the season to this glorious player to come over to Malta and play for our top team. We are leading the table at the moment.' Scottish Championship side Hibernian moved to clarify they had not offered a deal to Evans . Evans recently released a video statement claiming his innocence alongside girlfriend Natasha Massey (right) Evans scored 48 goals in 113 for Sheffield United before being convicted in 2012 . Evans wants to return to football after being released from prison in October. He served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011. He was initially given permission by Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players' union, the Professional Footballers Association. But following a backlash from Blades supporters, sponsors and patrons opposed to Evans' return - 160,000 people signed a petition against it - the club retracted the offer. Tranmere chairman Mark Palios claimed the League Two club turned down an approach from associates of Evans' about the possibility of him playing for the club, before League One Oldham last month denied reports they had offered Evans the opportunity to train with the club. Friday's news of Hibernians' interest in a deal attracted criticism on Twitter, and much of it was misdirected. Scottish Championship side Hibernian tweeted on Friday evening: 'Just to clarify we are Hibs of Scotland and not Hibernians of Malta. Should that ever change we'll let you all know. See you the morn, HFC.'","Ched Evans convicted of rape in 2012 and released from prison in October .

"There's always got to be that guy who steps it up at a wedding. Thankfully for this reception, six-year-old Harlan was there to warm up the dance floor. Literally. Dancing with himself: Harlan, six, literally warmed up the dance floor at his aunt and uncle's wedding . His Uncle Logan and Aunt Kelly, who had just tied the knot, were swaying lovingly to Crazy Little Thing Called Love. About five other couples were also gently rocking along to the live brass band music, arm-in-arm. But Harlan had other ideas. Taking advantage of the largely abandoned floor across the hall, the little boy grabbed his head with both hands, lay on his side, and let loose. Taking it slow: The rest of the guests, plus the bride and groom, were gently swaying to the live brass band . According to the cameraman Ronnie Blackburn, the party-starter was trying to impress a few of the young girls in attendance. No doubt they came flocking shortly after. Blackburn commented on his video: 'For those who have expressed concern, I assure you that Harlan is neither epileptic nor autistic; he is just a fun-loving, energetic kid with a cute dance. 'I think he may have been trying to impress some girls at the wedding, although I'm not sure if he picked the best dance for the job!'","Video shows married couple swaying to brass band music at reception .

"The Oscar-winning composer behind Jesus Christ Superstar is planning an even more ambitious scheme to connect the nation with its Christian heritage – wi-fi in every church. Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose father was music director at a London church, said the initiative would put the increasingly deserted buildings back at the centre of their local communities. The theatre impresario behind musicals including Cats and Evita has been in talks with Culture Minister Ed Vaizey, who is ‘actively’ considering the project. Scroll down in video . Andrew Lloyd Webber (left) has revealed his desire to see wi-fi in every church. The composer has also told of his admiration for Nicole Scherzinger (right), the former Pussycat Doll now starring in his revival of Cats . In an interview in today’s Event magazine, Lord Lloyd Webber says: ‘I want to get every church in the country on wi-fi. Once you do that, it becomes at the centre of the community again.’ Under the scheme, local businesses and residents could get access to broadband beamed from the steeple or use their devices within the buildings. The composer also suggests churches create apps that detail their hidden treasures, such as stained-glass windows, to boost visitors. Elsewhere in the interview, Lord Lloyd Webber discloses his admiration for Nicole Scherzinger, the former Pussycat Doll now starring in his revival of Cats. Lord Lloyd Webber described Nicole Scherzinger as a 'babe' and 'the most exciting musical theatre artist I have found' Describing her as a ‘babe’, he says: ‘I do believe she is the most exciting musical theatre artist I have found – well, that I have worked with – in very, very many years. I really do.’ Welcoming the wi-fi plans, the Bishop of Norwich, the Rt Rev Graham James, said his diocese was already using steeples to provide broadband to remote areas, adding: ‘It’s an imaginative way of using our huge network of ancient buildings for community purposes.’ Mr Vaizey said he was already rolling out a programme to equip 1,000 public buildings with broadband and was now thinking of ways to extend it to churches, perhaps with a fund they could apply to. He added: ‘We are keen to ensure our heritage is preserved.’","Composer says move would put churches back at centre of communities .

"The Church of England is embroiled in a row over proposals to sweep away laws that forbid a full Christian funeral to people who have taken their own lives. Most clergy now regard suicide with far more sympathy than when ‘self murder’ was still a crime, and the move will be seen as reflecting a growing acceptance as more Britons choose to end their lives in clinics such as Dignitas in Switzerland. But some critics within the Church say the reforms will ‘legalise’ suicide, which should still be regarded a serious sin. U-Turn: Most clergy now regard suicide with far more sympathy than when ‘self murder’ was still a crime . One senior member said: ‘The Church has always opposed suicide on the basis of the commandment Thou Shalt Not Kill, and that includes yourself.’ The move comes as Labour peer Lord Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill, which says terminally-ill patients must make a ‘voluntary’ and ‘informed’ decision to end their lives before they can be helped to do so, faces further debate in the House of Lords later this month. Those to welcome the possible Church move include art critic Brian Sewell, who revealed in an article two years ago that he would be prepared to take his own life if he became very ill. Mr Sewell said: ‘One of the most unchristian things a church can do is to refuse a proper burial to those that commit suicide. It is one of those petty meannesses that date back centuries and the Church should give consideration to this and deal with it fairly promptly.’ Under centuries-old Church rules, it is technically illegal for clergy to use official funeral services to bury those who have ‘laid violent hands’ upon themselves, particularly while of ‘sound mind’, although in reality the law is almost universally ignored. Art critic Brian Sewell revealed in an article two years ago that he would be prepared to take his own life if he became very ill . The Church of England’s General Synod meets next month, when members will call for Canon law to be reformed so that clergy who use the Church’s rites to bury those who have taken their own life in any circumstances are no longer in breach of the law. Under the current Church law, Canon B38, clergy are supposed to use a modified funeral service for people who have taken their own lives while of sound mind when they killed themselves, to reflect the Church’s concerns about suicide. Labour peer Lord Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill, says terminally-ill patients must make a ‘voluntary’ and ‘informed’ decision to end their lives . But no alternative service has ever been approved by Synod, despite several reports into the issue over the past 50 years, and the vast majority of the Synod is expected to support the proposed reforms. Leading the calls for reform, Canon Michael Parsons said many clergy were not even aware of what was an outdated law and were mainly concerned to treat the relatives and friends of the deceased with sensitivity. Canon Parsons, from Gloucester, said the change would bring the Church into line with what was now common practice and would help shed lingering perceptions that clergy were ‘hostile’ to those who feel compelled to take their own lives. One Briton a fortnight is now believed to end his or her life at the Dignitas clinic and for every one that travels abroad, ten terminally ill people are thought to take their lives in this country, according to supporters of the legislation. But former Government Minister Lord Tebbit, a vocal opponent of assisted suicide, said that by changing its laws the Church might suggest it had diluted its principles. He said: ‘The Church is in danger of getting into a muddle because we can take a merciful view of people who kill themselves while the balance of their mind is disturbed. ‘But we are now looking at cases in which people who appear to be quite sane want to take their own lives. The Church should think again.’","Clergy now regard suicide with far more sympathy than before .
But some critics within the Church say the reforms will ‘legalise’ suicide .

"A kind family who gave a stranger a lift and some money have been left devastated after the same man returned the following day and vandalized their home. Robert Boren, his 14-year-old daughter Olivia and his wife saw Derek Deshon Stephens, 24, walking up his street in Oklahoma City and offered him some tinned food and extra money because he said he was starving. However, just 24 hours after the act of kindness, Stephens arrived at his doorstep apparently under the influence  demanding his car keys, more money and a gun. Scroll down for video . Samritan: Robert Boren and his 14-year-old daughter Olivia saw Derek Deshon Stephens, 24, walking up his street in Oklahoma City and offered him so tinned food and money so he could eat . When Mr Boren refused and told him to leave, the suspect kicked over two 150-pound Christmas Decorations on their porch and used the pieces to break three windows. A father and son heard the commotion, so came running down the street with a golf club and baseball bat to chase the subject away. Stephens then tried to climb their back gate, but eventually fled. Mr Boren has described how the confrontation terrified him and his family while the rest of the neighborhood are also rattled. He told News 9: 'He asked me if he could have some tin cans that were out on the front in a bag to be given away. 'And then he said well, then can I have something to eat, I'm starving. So I gave him some money to eat on.' Shocking: Just 24 hours after the act of kindness, Stephens arrived at the doorstep of the family home, apparently under the influence, demanding his car keys, more money and a gun . Repsonse: When Mr Boren refused, Stephens reacted angrily sreaming 'let me in' while kicking over Christmas decorations on their porch . Vandalism: Stephens then used some of the broken pieces from the items to break the windows at the front of the property . Scared: Olivia, Mr Boren's 14-year-old daughter, was in the family's SUV when they picked Stephens up for the first time and thought he was a 'nice man' Mr Boren then gave Mr Stephens $10 so he left, but a short time later he returned and asked if he could have ride. 'And I said, ""No, I can't go that far. We're late to where we're going"",' Boredn added. 'Then he said, ""Can you just take me up the street?'' Mr Boren therefore let the man inside his SUV and drove him a couple of blocks. The next day around 2pm, the Borens said Derek showed up again, but appeared to be under the influence. 'I was just doing him a favor,' said Boren. 'He seemed nice,' said Robert's 14-year-old daughter, Olivia. 'I was just thinking, what am I going to do if he gets in here. Is he going to hurt everybody? Like what is going to happen? I was scared.' Mr Boren added: 'I think that I was not very smart in giving him any money, or giving him a ride. But I was trying to do what I thought would be the good thing to do.' Stephens was arrested and is now in custody under a $10,000 bond.","Robert Boren saw Derek Deshon Stephens, 24, walking up his street .

"It has long been thought that first-born children are more successful and ambitious than their younger brothers and sisters. But a new study has revealed that the elder child's achievements can help boost their younger siblings exam results by helping them to raise their game, which in turn can help them eclipse the first born's success. Researchers are calling it the 'sibling spillover effect' and could point to why top tennis player Jamie Murray was eclipsed by his younger brother Andy and why Ed Miliband clinched the Labour party leadership instead of his older brother David. Top tennis player Jamie Murray, right, was eventually outclassed by his younger brother Andy, who has won two grand slam titles . For the first time ever, academics from the University of Essex examined how the success of first born children in school impacted on their younger brothers and sisters by studying primary school test results and then GCSE scores. And the data showed that having an older brother or sister boosted a child's learning with the effect the equivalent of spending an extra £670 on the younger sibling's schooling. The effect is even more pronounced in less well-off families showing poorer children benefit more from a having high-attaining older sibling. Older Miliband brother David, right, was tipped to be the Labour party leader but was pipped to the post by younger brother Ed . One of the study's authors Birgitta Rabe explained: 'The older sibling’s achievement may have a direct effect on the younger sibling’s school grades if the older sibling teaches the younger sibling or helps with homework; the younger sibling imitates the older sibling, for example in their work style, or conversely tries to be different, for example to avoid competition the older sibling passes on important information about educational choices or school and teachers to the younger sibling. 'We find that the spillover effect is larger for siblings in families eligible for free school meals, living in deprived neighbourhoods and speaking a language other than English at home. 'This means that children from more deprived backgrounds benefit more from a high attaining older sibling than children from more affluent backgrounds.' Now along with fellow author of the study, Cheti Nicoletti, Ms Rabe explained that it showed how investing in in children may have multiplier effects through their impact on younger relatives. Previous studies have seemed to suggest that first borns are usually more successful than their brothers and sisters and often have traits of being more organised and responsible as well as being keen to being in charge. While last borns are often described as more rebellious, outgoing, charming and more dependent on others. Earlier this year another study by the University of Essex suggested that firstborn girls are statistically more likely to be the most highly qualified of all their family. The research found older females are 13 per cent more ambitious then firstborn sons.","Study shows older children help younger siblings boost their achievement .

"A Dallas mom facing kidnapping charges has given an interview from jail to try and 'clear the record', saying she did not abduct the two children but thought something was wrong and was trying to help. Briana Blount was arrested Wednesday after one of her neighbors in McKinney saw her with two kids that were not her own, sensed something was wrong and called police. The 23-year-old mother-of-one - who has a history of drug problems and admits to using meth - says she found the seven-year-old boy and his four-year-old sister unattended on New Year's Eve at the at the Garland Road Thrift Store. She told CBS DFW she decided to take them to her apartment four miles away to call police. 'This is a misunderstanding': Dallas woman Briana Blount gives an interview from Lew Sterrett Justice Center, saying she did not kidnap two children but tried to help them, believing they had been abandoned . Scene: Blount said she found the two kids - aged seven and four - unnattended at the Garland Road Thrift Store in White Rock around 5.30pm on New Years Eve .

Arrested: Blount has been charged with two counts of kidnapping and assaulting a peace officer and has other outstanding warrants for driving without insurance and without a valid license . 'It doesn't look good, but those actions weren't based off of kidnapping,' she said. 'Those actions weren't based off of trying to hurt or trying to take somebody away from anything. 'I legitimately thought something was wrong and I was trying to help.' However the children's father was in the change room trying on clothes, only to come out and not be able to find his kids. An employee at the store told the father she saw a white woman leave with the children, who are black. Blount said she didn't call 911 from the store because she was alone and knew her friends were home at her apartment complex and wanted their help. 'I felt as if I needed to help these kids and keep them safe until I could get them in the hands of the police,' she told CBS. However her neighbor, April Hobbs, saw the situation differently. Mom: Blount has a young son named Aiden, who is currently with his father in Michigan . 'I legitimately thought something was wrong and I was trying to help': Briana Blount is trying to clear her name . Locked up: The Dallas woman has been accused of kidnapping .

"The mother of missing girl Lisa Irwin has spoken of her ongoing anguish over the loss of her daughter - and revealed that she still looks into every passing stroller wondering if the child inside is actually hers. Deborah Irwin also repeated how she regrets getting drunk with a friend on the night her daughter, aged just 10 months, vanished more than three years ago. In a tearful interview alongside her husband Jeremy, she told how she felt kidnappers took advantage of a moment of weakness and snatched her child while she wasn't alert enough to react. Scroll down for video . Tearful: Deborah Irwin spoke out in a Fox News interview - and said she still looks at girls in the street and wonders whether they are her missing daughter Lisa . New image: This digital image shows what Lisa may look like today. She went missing aged ten months . Deborah remembers tucking her daughter in on October 4, 2011, then started drinking in the house with a friend, while Jeremy was working a night shift. He came home to find the child missing, and despite years of searching neither they nor police have a clue what happened to her. Speaking to Fox News anchor Megan Kelly, Deborah revealed how the loss still haunts her and has her constantly wondering whether children the age her daughter would be now - around four years old - are actually Lisa. She told Kelly: 'I did it all day today when we were walking around before we came here to see you. We were standing on the corner and I see a little girl.' 'She was in her stroller, she was about Lisa's age, and I looked down at her and I said to Jeremy: ""I'm really tired of looking at everybody else's kid hoping it's mine.""' Reward: A benefactor offered $100,000 for any information leading to Lisa's recovery. Police are said to be receiving around two leads per week in the case . The parents also said that they keep her room as it was when Lisa vanished - and keep filling in with presents after every birthday and Christmas for Lisa to open should she return. Deborah said the room is a source of comfort to them. She said: 'It feels good to go in there, and smell her, and know that someday she's going to come home and she's gonna see all these presents and she's gonna be excited to open them and to watch her reaction and stuff like that.' Police are still hunting for Lisa, and are called up with around two tips per week. A $100,000 reward has been posted for information leading to her safe return. Filling up: Deborah and Jeremy keep buying Christmas and birthday presents for Lisa, and leave them all in her room for when she gets back . Pristine: The Irwins have not changed Lisa's room, except to add more things. A framed version of her extrapolated image can be seen framed above . Recently a new missing poster was put out featuring a digital version of what her face may look like more than three years on, which Deborah and Jeremy hope will prompt more leads in the search. However, the frantic night they realized their daughter was missing still haunts them, and their accounts have prompted waves of criticism from those who suspect or doubt their account. Returning to the desperate discovery that Lisa was missing, Deborah spoke of her biggest regret from that night - her decision to drink after putting Lisa to bed. She says the alcohol made her less alert for what she believes was a planned snatching. She said: 'I wish I hadn't been drinking. I feel like it was planned and they were gonna take her... maybe if I hadn't been drinking I would have heard something and got up. I just feel like I didn't save her.'

"A minister stormed out of a top-level meeting after EU chiefs agreed with Spain to exclude Gibraltar from an important air safety deal. Robert Goodwill quit the Brussels summit ‘in protest’ at the ‘astonishing’ decision to shut out the British territory from a plan to make flights safer and quicker by merging airspace. Mr Goodwill refused to come back into the room even as the EU Transport Council gathering went on to discuss other topics. His extraordinary intervention means the air safety deal is on ice and new negotiations will now be required to revive it. Spain secured EU support to block the inclusion of Gibraltar aiport , pictured, from a new air safety deal . Government minister Robert Goodwill, pictured, stormed out of the EU transport meeting following the snub . It marks yet another round in the bitter, centuries-old row over the sovereignty of ‘The Rock’. Gibraltar is a British overseas territory with a naval base and a military garrison, but despite losing control of it in 1713, Spain still wants to win it back. The latest spat concerns an EU initiative called ‘Single European Sky’, which seeks to merge national air-traffic control systems, and reduce delays and near-misses endured by passengers. For more than a decade Spain has been threatening to exclude Gibraltar’s airport from the wording of the agreement, even though the Rock is part of the EU. The move has been described by sources as an act of ‘political point-scoring’. Tensions finally boiled over at a meeting of the EU Transport Council on December 3. A draft version of the text included Gibraltar, in line with earlier agreements, and ‘that would have been favourable to the UK’, Transport Minister Mr Goodwill wrote to MPs. But after Spain again sought to exclude Gibraltar from the deal, Italy agreed to the ploy as a way of getting the proposal wrapped up while it still held the rotating EU presidency. The revised text did not specifically include the disputed territory, and added a footnote stating ‘the question on how to reflect the Gibraltar issue in the text is awaiting the outcome of discussions between Spain and UK’. Mr Goodwill said he ‘objected in the strongest possible terms’ but EU officials declared that a deal had been reached. It was subsequently agreed that the document could not be driven through in its current form due to Mr Goodwill’s objection. ‘I left the Council in protest at what was a completely unacceptable situation,’ the Scarborough Tory MP said of the incident.","Robert Goodwill stormed out of major EU meeting after Gibraltar snub .

"Princess Eugenie was spotted returning to a chalet in the Swiss Alps after a day on the slopes. Wearing a padded blue jacket and plaid shirt, the 24-year-old royal looked relaxed as she stepped out of the car with a group of friends, including Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas. It comes after her father, Prince Andrew, issued a statement denying allegations that he abused an underage girl at an orgy when she was being used as a sex slave. Winter holiday: Princess Eugenie was spotted returning to a chalet after a day on the slopes with friends . Getaway: Among the group was Cressida Bonas, seen in background, Prince Harry's former girlfriend . Retreat: The 24-year-old royal was spotted arriving at this idyllic snow-covered chalet in the Swiss Alps . In an extraordinary legal allegation, a woman said she was ‘forced’ to have sex with the prince at parties in London, New York and the Caribbean. Last night the prince issued a strongly-worded denial, with Buckingham Palace saying ‘any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue’. The woman – named only as Jane Doe #3 – says in court documents she was told to ‘give the prince whatever he demanded’ by his friend Jeffrey Epstein, the US billionaire paedophile who hosted the sordid parties. Legal documents lodged with a court in Florida name Andrew, 54, as one of three men allegedly involved in abusing the woman 13 years ago when she was 17 – which is underage in Florida state law. Epstein, a long-term friend of Prince Andrew, was one of the best-connected men in America until he was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting girls for underage prostitution. Snow day: Princess Eugenie, pictured left, was skiing with her close friend, Cressida Bonas, pictured right . Alpine retreat: The friends were pictured at the chalet as Andrew continued to deny the 'sex slave' claims . Active: Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, pictured left and right, looked relaxed and natural . The prince stayed friends with him despite his conviction and they were seen together in 2011 after Epstein’s release from jail. Last night a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘This relates to long-standing and ongoing civil proceedings in the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party. As such we would not comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.’ While Eugenie has been enjoying a holiday in Verbier, her sister, Princess Beatrice, was seen sipping champagne in the Carbibbean. There, she was photographed on a yacht in St Barts with Bee Shaffer, whose mother Anna Wintour is editor-in-chief at American Vogue.

'I wanted to do something different for the new one and had always wanted to do a race, so I thought why not the most famous race in the world, the Grand National,' he says. Steven Barley created the elaborate set-up in his garden, calling it the Grand Nutional . The teacher and writer hilariously narrates the antics of his two key racers . Filmed in October, Barley found time over the Christmas break to edit his patiently compiled footage of Ninja Nutcase and Lady Bobtail as they take on the five obstacle course, including a water jump - Lord Greystroke showed promise but shied away from the jumps. While the squirrels look more than willing to take on the course, that's largely thanks to Barley's clever method of introducing his little mates to the jumps made out of 'quality junk' from around his house including pan scourers, plastic spoons. 'I gradually move the nuts along the course so when they come to it they have a new challenge, but they're very clever and work it out quickly,' he says. The squirrels can be seen jumping over a series of fences on a suspended plank . Lady Bobtail tackles the longer of the jumps, unlike Ninja Nutcase who skirted round it . The two squirrels finally reach their prize - and endless supply of nuts right at the end of the run . Ninja Nutcase dips a paw in the water... before stopping to have a quick drink while completing the course . The teacher even set up a model to wave the flag to signal the beginning of the race . Barley stresses while in a sense he's training them to do the course, he would never hand feed them. 'I'd never do anything to harm them and they're not doing anything more than they would in the wild,' he says. 'But they are a great source of entertainment for us.'","Steven Barley creates videos of squirrels on elaborate obstacle course .

"An officer who has spent 17 years patrolling one of America's worst areas has found a way to keep the peace that focuses less on arrests, and more on helping those who have fallen on the most difficult of times. Deon Joseph, or the Sheriff of Skidberry as he is known to many in the area, works on Skid Row, the Los Angeles neighborhood known for its overwhelmingly high homeless population, with some 2,000 people sleeping on the streets every night, and where drugs are drug addicts are all around. He is less concerned with arrests however than with keeping the order by helping those in the community, preferring to do his rounds on foot and not in his squad car as he checks on the homeless and drug addicts, referring to them all as 'sir' or 'ma'am' to show them the respect they do not get anywhere else, and passes out hygiene kits to make sure they are staying clean. Joseph has also never once fired his gun - and the LAPD says crime is dropping and the streets are safer and cleaner than they were just two years ago . LAPD officer Deon Joseph has patrolled Skid Row for 17 years, photo courtesy of Skid Row Stories . Skid Row is one of the worst neighborhood's in the country, with massive poverty, homelessness and drug usage . LAPD says crime is dropping and the streets are safer and cleaner than they were just two years ago . 'You cannot separate the blight and crap that's out here from death,' Joseph told a CNN reporter as they walked through the area. 'One time I saw a guy sitting on a pile of trash and I saw a hand, a white hand. I thought it was a mannequin. It wasn't a mannequin. It was a dead woman. He didn't realize he was sitting on top of a dead woman, eating donated food.' Joseph also shares stories of addicts he has seen drop hundreds of pounds as they succumb to drugs, the constant unsanitary conditions that give Skid row the smell of 'urine, feces and burning crack and weed,' and how, despite all of this, the people who live here are his people. It's not just the hygiene kits that separate him from other officers around the country, but the self-defense class he teaches for women in the area called 'Ladies Night,' and the flyers he hands out letting people know how they can apply for housing and his belief that he would rather make sure an addict is alive and safe rather than arrest them. He also hands out his cell phone and email info for anyone who wants to contact him at any time - and doesn't mind when residents refer to him as Deon and not Officer Joseph. 'I feel respect when they call me by my first name, and I show them respect by calling them sir or ma'am.' Homeless people rest on a public sidewalk  in downtown Skid Row . Officer Joseph believes that the key to helping Skid Row residents is affordable housing . Joseph spends his days passing out his email and cell phone number to people so they can contact him . The only thing he can't provide is the one thing he believes Skid Row needs more than anything to turn things around - affordable housing. 'Skid Row is a toxic petri dish that thwarts any form of recovery,' says Joseph. 'We have beer barons selling singles for $2, right outside AA meetings.' This may be the time that things do finally turn around for the area however, which will hopefully benefit from the $2billion earmarked for subsidized housing in next year's $1.1trillion federal spending bill. As for Joseph, his path to the job seems to be the direct result of a life changing mistake his father almost made as a younger man. Angered over the murder of his father, Joseph's grandfather, by a 16-year-old white boy in Louisiana, his rage almost put him on the path to a life of crime - until he tried to mug a preacher at gunpoint. 'Put that gun down, boy,' the man said. 'You're not going to jail today, but I want to see you in church.' He did go to church, and would later pay that opportunity for a second chance forward, started a construction company that made a point of employing ex-convicts. 'You cannot separate the blight and crap that's out here from death,' said Joseph . Joseph and Officer Banks working remote cameras placed in LA's Downtown Skid Row . Joseph devotes almost all his time to Skid Row, which he consider his neighborhood and whose residents are his people . Joseph's mother meanwhile spent her time feeding the homeless, while also raising the 41 foster children the family took in. And now, Joseph is continuing the family tradition of helping others, no matter what their circumstance. 'This is what I have to do, he explains. 'I can go anywhere in this department. There are 17 divisions. I can go back to Venice, sip on lattes, chase celebrities in Hollywood. I can go anywhere. I can leave at any time. I choose to be here. I want to help these people. It's in my heart to help these people.'","Deon Joseph is an LAPD officer who has worked the Skid Row neighborhood for 17 years .

"Internet companies are refusing to pass on potentially critical information to GCHQ and improved their privacy settings following the Edward Snowden scandal which has allowed criminals to evade detection . Internet companies are refusing to pass on potentially critical evidence to GCHQ on serious criminals such as drug dealers and paedophiles because they do not meet their criteria for causing enough harm. By improving encryption on their services, the companies, which include telecoms firms and social media companies, are also indirectly helping criminals evade detection. The improvements were made following the Edward Snowden leaks on GCHQ tactics. The revelations, revealed by The Daily Telegraph, come as internet companies are also facing criticism for not doing enough to stop terrorists and fanatics from spreading extremism. Robert Hannigan, the new director of GCHQ, warned in November that some internet services were 'the command and control networks of choice' for terrorists and criminals. He said those companies were in 'denial'. Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, backed those claims and called for technology firms to do more to help protect the public from criminals. Facebook was criticised for failing to pass on information about Michael Adebowale, who went on to kill Fusilier Lee Rigby along with his co-offender Michael Adebokajo. Five months before the 2013 murder, Adebowale had expressed his intent to murder a soldier in the 'most graphic and emotive manner'. Facebook was unaware of the comments, but had previously closed Adebowale's accounts for discussing terrorism, something it has not informed security services of. GCHQ works with the National Crime Agency to target the most serious criminal bosses and gangs. But a senior security source told the newspaper that providers have a threshold for releasing information on their users and only do so if there is a direct threat to life.

Internet companies have a threshold for releasing information on their users and only do so if there is a direct threat to life; many criminals the GCHQ track cause significant damage to communities but don't pose a direct threat to life, so their private information remains a secret . The problem arises because, unlike terror suspects, many criminals GCHQ tracks, cause significant harm in the community, rather than posing a direct threat to life. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said internet companies needed to 'cooperate fully' to ensure that criminals were prosecuted. After Snowden stole tens of thousands of files from the US National Security Agency, internet companies improved their privacy settings, which authorities claim criminals and now exploiting.","Criminals must pose a direct threat to life for information to be released .

"An international manhunt has been launched for a 'dangerous' murder suspect after a woman was found dead in a hotel room. The body of Nadine Aburas, 28, was discovered by staff at the Future Inn hotel in Cardiff on New Year's Eve. South Wales Police say they are treating the death as murder and want to trace suspect Sammy Almahri, an American national from New York City. Nadine Aburas was found dead in a guest room at the Future Inn hotel in Cardiff on New Year's Eve . An international manhunt has been launched for Sammy Almahri after Nadine Aburas was found dead in a room at the Future Inn hotel in Cardiff on New Year's Eve . Almahri, 44, who has distinctive injuries to his face, had an 'existing friendship' with Ms Aburas and is now believed to be in Tanzania, east Africa, the force said. The suspect checked into the Future Inn hotel in Cardiff Bay on December 30 before Ms Aburas arrived at around 9pm that evening. He then left the building at about 3am on New Year's Eve and took a flight from Heathrow to Bahrain at 10.30am. Detective Superintendent Paul Hurley said Almahri is considered 'dangerous' and 'very resourceful' as he appealed for the public's help to find him. He said: 'The hotel was busy with people who were in the city to celebrate Christmas and New Year's Eve.  People will have seen them together, or on their own, and I would urge them to come forward. 'While we have not yet made any arrests, we have a team of officers who are trying to trace Sammy Almahri, and now believe he is in Tanzania. The body of Nadine Aburas, 28, was discovered by staff at the Future Inn hotel (pictured) in Cardiff on New Year's Eve . 'We have been working closely with our counterparts in both NYPD and police officers in Tanzania. From our inquiries we have discovered that Almahri is very resourceful and has access to funds, which may further assist his evasion from law enforcement agencies. 'I consider this man to be a dangerous individual and would advise that any knowledge of his location or sightings of him are reported immediately to the authorities - and he is not to be approached. 'We are supporting Nadine's family with specially trained officers and they have paid the following tribute to her - but at this stage would now like to be left to grieve privately.' A post-mortem examination has been completed but a cause of death has not yet been confirmed. Ms Aburas's family paid tribute to her as a 'lovely, bubbly girl and unique and talented woman'. In a statement, they said: 'She always wanted to help people and everybody loved her. She has left such a massive hole in our family and we will miss her so much.

"It was a question that plagued spooks for three decades - was Nick Clegg's great aunt a Soviet agent? Countess Moura Budberg's life reads like it was right off the pages of an espionage thriller, with walk-on parts from Josef Stalin, HG Wells and notorious Cambridge spy ring traitors Guy Burgess and Donald McLean. But it was the Russian emigre's relationship with famous agent Robert Bruce Lockhart that first aroused the suspicions of British intelligence. Intelligence officials speculated for three decades about whether Nick Clegg's great aunt, Countess Moura Budberg, pictured above, was a soviet spy . It had been well known that Lockhart had fallen for a woman named Moura when he was in Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution - and that woman turned out to be Countess Budberg. The pair had met in 1918, when Lockhart was head of the British Legation in Russia, and Countess Budgerg was married to another man. Their romance was later dramatised in the 1934 film Secret Agent. The Countess was later cleared of being a spy and left Estonia. While living between Germany and Italy she applied to enter Britain to be with her niece, Baroness Kira von Engelhardt, The Independent reported. British authorities were not concerned about Baroness Engelhardt, but in the 1950s one spy sent a memo to another, expressing doubts about 'Kera (sic) Clegg', who appeared to be closely linked to Countess Budberg. Countess Engelhardt had changed her surname after marrying, Hugh Clegg. The couple were the grandparents of Nick Clegg, who has previously described his great aunt as an 'utterly terrifying' woman. The newspaper searched the National Archives and reports that Countess Budberg's name appeared in hundreds of documents, gathered by British intelligence officers over a 30 year period. Whether the Countess was in fact a Soviet spy was a question the MI5 never answered. Despite having contacts across Europe, including inside Stalin's regime, they suspected she was probably the target of hostile gossip. The French, however, concluded she was a spy. The British secret service's various informants were inconsistent in their observations about Countess Budberg. Her looks, intelligence and morality were debated. She was called an 'absolute devil', but it was also suggested that she could simply be the victim of spitefulness. Despite having had several male lovers, at least one source thought she was a lesbian. Lockhart and Countess Budberg were arrested in the panic that followed an attempt on Lenin's life in 1918. Lockhart was soon released. The Countess is thought to have later secured her freedom by seducing her investigating officer. Clegg, pictured as a boy with his father Nicholas Clegg, described his great aunt as 'utterly terrifying' Whether the Countess was in fact a Soviet spy was a question the MI5 never answered. Despite having contacts across Europe, including inside Stalin's regime, they suspected she was probably the target of hostile gossip. The French, however, concluded she was a spy . She then returned to Russia where she began working for writer Maxim Gorky, before becoming his lover. A year later, in 1921, Gorky secured permission for her to move to Estonia, after she had spent the night with HG Wells, who was staying with them. When she moved, documents noted that she the Countess had married another man, who she lived with for a year before they divorced. It was thought it was a marriage of convenience to secure the Countess Estonian citizenship. The Countess later reunited with Gorky and they lived together in Berlin for several years before the author returned to Russia. The newspaper speculated that her move to Britain was perhaps motivated more by her fear of being without a lover, than to be with her niece. The Countess soon became well connected in the UK and British authorities continued to keep her under surveillance. But because high profile people like wartime solicitor General Lord Iowitt and the Minister of Information, Lord Duff Cooper, vouched for her good character, the Countess simply remained a mystery. She had worked for Lord Cooper during the war. Clegg's aunt, Countess Budberg, became a British citizen in 1947; her first vote was for Labour . Countess Budgerg remained in contact with Gorky whose house remained under surveillance by Stalin's police.  She travelled in and out of Russia on four occasions, the last of which was in 1936 when Gorky lay dying. She never required a visa and it is thought that is because Russian police may have wanted something from her. The trips ignited the suspicions of Maurice Dayet, secretary of the French embassy, who went on to warn his British counterparts about her. It was also thought the Countess was being paid by the Germans, but this was later dismissed. In April 1942, Winston Churchill's personal aide, Sir Desmond Morton, wrote to the secret service about the Countess warning that she was a 'perfect terror at intrigue'. The service acknowledged they knew a great deal about her, but said they considered her to be anti-nazi. Countess Budberg became a British citizen in 1947. Her first vote was for Labour. She came under suspicion again in 1951 when the MI5 were told that HG Well's family had known for years that she was a spy. And when the British intelligence service was hit by one of the biggest spy scandals in history, in May 1951, her name came up again. Two agents, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, disappeared after the FBI learned that MacLean was a spy. Burgess had dined with the Countess on a number of occasions. But the British secret service never decided what to make of Countess Bugberg who died in November 1974. It concluded that it was 'a virtual impossibility' to draw any conclusions based on the conflicting reports about her.","Countess Moura Budberg formed a relationship with a famous British spy .

"She has endorsed everything from scented candles to crockery and fashion in various failed bids to impress American shoppers. Now the Duchess of York is once again attempting to become a commercial success in the US – this time with an extraordinary film plugging a range of products including the bizarrely named ‘Fusion Xcelerator food emulsifier’. Called Duchess Discoveries, the 28-minute ‘infomercial’ is scheduled to air on American television early this year. Scroll down for video . Saleswoman: Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson in an advert for her Fusion Xcelerator 'food emulsfier' And judging by a four-minute teaser seen by The Mail on Sunday, Fergie appears enthusiastic but somewhat wooden as she attempts to sell her products in front of a studio audience. A voiceover explains that the Duchess is ‘one of the most recognised personalities on the planet’ before going on to say her ‘personal struggles and adversity have empowered her to be her best and help others improve their lives’. Things are certainly going better for the 55-year-old Duchess, who has lost almost 4st and has reportedly restored her relationship with the Queen. Now she has teamed up with mail-order specialist Tristar Products, which has previously marketed products with Rod Stewart’s ex-wife Rachel Hunter and the late comedienne Joan Rivers. As well as her involvement in the commercial campaign, the Duchess has also registered five trademarks, including ‘Fergie’s Farms’. Currently, the Fusion Xcelerator is the only product available to buy in the US on duchessdiscoveries.com, billed as ‘the official site of Sarah Ferguson’. Described as a ‘powerful micro-emulsification system’, the seven-piece machine costing $99.99 (£65) also comes with the Duchess’s meal plan. Manufacturers claim the processor breaks down food into a ‘micro-cellular pre-digestive state’ and ‘captures all of the essential vitamins, minerals, anti-oxidants and phyto-nutrients’ to ensure the healthiest smoothies. On camera, the Duchess claims the food processor accelerates weight loss, boosts energy and strengthens the immune system. It is understood she has been using the juicer for 14 months to aid her weight loss. However, Sioned Quirke, a leading British dietician and obesity specialist, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Any blender can break down food. This one uses several jargon terms to make it sound superior when it probably isn’t. ‘Breaking food down to a pre-digestive state is the job of your stomach and it does it well. You don’t need anything to help it do its job. ‘And no juicer or blender can enhance how much nutrition your body will actually absorb. Having juices or blended foods can actually make weight loss more difficult as the food doesn’t stay in your stomach long enough to make you feel full or satisfied after a meal. ‘I’d advise people to be careful who they put their trust into. Just because you use a celebrity or a self-endorsed “expert” does not mean you are qualified to provide advice on nutrition or weight loss.’ Yvonne Wolski-Worman, from Pennsylvania, was in the audience when the programme was filmed last July. She said: ‘The Duchess talked about losing 55lb, more through juicing than exercise. I got the impression she doesn’t like exercise.’ After her divorce from Prince Andrew 19 years ago, the Duchess took on a string of endorsements in the US, including a deal with WeightWatchers. However, in 2006 the company set up to capitalise on her image in the US collapsed with debts of more than £1 million. Unperturbed, Fergie has recently filed her trademarks, which could enable her to endorse products including heated hair brushes and a line of farm produce. Friends say she will launch a range of up to 17 speciality teas in the next few weeks. A friend said: ‘Sarah would never endorse a product unless it worked for her. She’s in a really good place at the moment. She keeps saying “This is me time” and “This is my time to blossom”. In England she will always be the Duchess of Pork. But in LA or New York she’s still a Royal and the Americans love that.’ ...And does it explain her VERY desirable new life in Belgravia? The Duchess of York is so confident that her new US ventures will be successful that friends say she is planning to move out of Royal Lodge, the Windsor home she still shares Prince Andrew, 19 years after their divorce – although this has been officially denied. The Mail on Sunday has learnt that Fergie is renting an apartment from a friend in upmarket Eaton Square in Belgravia, where Charles Saatchi and Nigella Lawson once lived – and where rents can reach up to £10,000 a week. However, a source said the Duchess is paying a ‘peppercorn amount’. ‘She is using the Eaton Square place as her London base,’ said one friend. ‘She intends to spend much of this year splitting her time between London and the US while she launches her businesses and if things take off she may consider getting somewhere more permanent.’ Upmarket: The Eaton Square home the 55-year-old is using as a London base .","Endorsed everything from scented candles to crockery and fashion .

"History textbooks inspired by the Horrible Histories franchise are making a mockery of the past, a leading teacher has claimed. Robert Peal, a history teacher and research fellow for the think tank Civitas, said giving pupils books which make light of subjects encouraged them not to think about the past but to laugh at it. Mr Peal cited Horrible Histories, a multi-million pound text and audio book franchise, as being responsible for the decline in standards. Scroll down for video . Robert Peal said the Horrible Histories books encouraged pupils not to think about the past but to laugh at it . Slamming chapters titled 'Was Henry VII a gangster?' and 'There's something about Mary' which detail Henry VII and Mary Tudor respectively, Mr Peal said: 'You would be hard pushed to find a stretch of more than 200 words that is not broken by a cartoon or a snippet of ""source material"".' Speaking generally about textbooks given to secondary school history pupils, he said: 'The layout often resembles a magazine, not a book, with short chunks of boxed text designed to cater to the supposedly minimal attention spans of today's pupils. 'The aesthetic owes much to the Horrible Histories series, with children encouraged not to think about the past but to laugh at it.' Mr Peal made his comments in an article for the Times Educational Supplement. Earlier this year, in a piece for the Mail, Mr Peal described his experiences as a history teacher at an inner-city school. Among problems at hand, he said, was an abundance of bad behaviour and seeming lack of ideas on how to improve upon this. Robert Peal (left) said the books were dumbing down children's study of history. Their author, Terry Deary (right) previously said he was not a historian and did all of his research second hand . He welcomed the then Education Secretary Michael Gove's 'culture war' against children-centred teaching methods, claiming old fashioned books and disciplinary tactics were more effective. Horrible Histories began in 1993 with a series of books by author Terry Deary. Among the texts, called Gory Stories, are accounts of the Egyptians and the Roman era. CBBC created a children's television programme of the series while many of the books, including Vile Victorians and Frightful First World War have been adapted into plays. In 2014 the author behind the series, Terry Deary, said in an interview that all of his research is second hand. 'I don't go to primary sources and I don't go digging fields for coins. 'I read other people's big, fat history books for the good stuff, so my readers don't have to,' the writer told the Independent. He added while he had been a teacher, he was not a historian and did not purport to be one. 'I'm not a historian. I am a children's author, and I had 50 fiction books published long before the Horrible Histories series came along.' The series has been adapted into plays and television programmes.

'Boko Haram has been abducting young men from villages in the area because we are close to their stronghold in Sambisa forest,' he said. Witness Mohammed Zarami said the gunmen arrived at the village  heavily armed but did not fire shots or kill anyone. 'People ran out of their houses in fear but they warned no one should disobey them,' Zarami told Reuters in Maiduguri, where he had fled to on foot. 'They took away over 40 (male) youths mostly between the ages of 15 to 23. As I am talking to you now, there is no youth in our village,' he said. There was no immediate comment on the incident from the military in Maiduguri. ‎Residents of Malari and nearby villages fled, fearing further attacks and abductions. Boko Haram has recently been seizing young men during raids on area villages to use as foot soldiers in its uprising aimed at establishing an Islamic state in northern Nigeria, residents said. Suspected Boko Haram gunmen launched a deadly raid on Tuesday on Kautikari village near Chibok, torched several buildings and killed as many as 15 people, according to witnesses. There was no toll available from an official source on the raid. Boko Haram is still holding in captivity more than 200 schoolgirls it abducted from their school in Chibok in Borno state last April.

"Britain's most famous warship will undergo a multi-million pound make-over to save it for the nation. HMS Victory, which was first launched in 1765, was Admiral Lord Nelson's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The battle was one of the most decisive  victories for the British against the French and Spanish and confirmed the naval supremacy they had established through the 18th century. A sum of £50million has been set aside to refit HMS Victory, which is Britain's most famous warship . HMS Victory's most famous moment came in the Battle of Trafalgar, when used as Lord Nelson's flagship . The latest round of maintenance work is set to be the largest of its kind on an historic warship. Among the issues include building a new dry dock cradle and making her top deck watertight. Andrew Baines, curator at the National Museum of the Royal Navy and project director of HMS Victory, said it might be the last chance to save the ship. 'We are probably at the last opportunity to truly save the ship and make sure that significant historic material is going to survive in her', he said. The need to restore certain parts of the ship emerged when a £550,000 survey gave the conservation team a clearer picture of her condition. The results of the survey produced 3D images of Victory and even revealed her keel had dropped by half a centimetre a year due to the water damage. It was in 1955 the last conservation project began, but it was not finished until 2002. In 2012, £50million was put aside for the HMS Victory Preservation Trust - £25million each from the Sir Donald Gosling Foundation and Ministry of Defence. During the Battle of Trafalgar, Victory led 27 British ships to triumph over 33 French and Spanish ships . Mr Baines, 33, told the Portsmouth News: 'The last time a large-scale conservation project took place on Victory it took nearly 50 years. 'We are probably at the last opportunity to truly save the ship and make sure significant historic material is going to survive. 'Money isn't an issue, it's just the complexity of Victory.' Although it had been in service for 40 years by the time, HMS Victory's most famous moment came during the Battle of Trafalgar, when it was used as Lord Nelson's flagship. During the battle, Victory led 27 British ships to triumph over 33 from the French and Spanish navy. The Franco-Spanish fleet lost twenty-two ships, without a single British vessel being lost. The battle was seen as confirmation of Britain's naval supremacy - in part due to Nelson's unorthodox tactics. He went against traditional naval convention and divided his smaller force into two columns directed perpendicularly against the larger enemy fleet. The result was a decisive British victory, with the commander of the joint French and Spanish forces, Admiral Villeneuve, captured along with his ship Bucentaure. The battle is widely seen as Britain's greatest naval victory, but during the action Nelson was fatally wounded by a French sniper on the deck of HMS Victory. His body was brought back to England where he was given a state funeral. Nelson's death secured his position as one of Britain's most heroic military figures and numerous monuments, including Nelson's Column in London's Trafalgar Square have been created in his memory. Victory has been in dry dock since 1922 and has seen more than 25 million people walk along her decks. Portsmouth Historic Dockyard wants to keep the warship open to the elements and is hoping to avoid closing her off to the public like the Mary Rose. HMS Victory was launched in 1765 at a cost of £63,176 in modern-day figures - the equivalent to building an aircraft carrier. She was built from 6,000 trees, 90 per cent of which were oak - the equivalent of 100 acres of woodlands. The HMS Victory has 37 sails flown from three masts and it would carry 23 spare sails during battle. The total sail area is 6,510 square yards. Her top speed was 11 knots, or 12mph. HMS Victory first saw battle in 1778 under Admiral Augustus Keppel in the First Battle of Ushant and again two years later in the second Battle of Ushant. She was also called into action in the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797 under Admiral Sir John Jervis. For the next two years, she was fitted as a hospital ship. The warship will always be best known for her pivotal role in the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar under Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson. The battle was a decisive victory for the British but Nelson was fatally wounded. In 1903, she was unintentionally rammed and severely damaged by HMS Neptune. Repairs were completed in 1928 and she was open to the public. However, in 1941 she was damaged again during a bombing raid. This led to the start of the 'great repair' in 1955, which was finished in 2002. Ownership of the warship was transferred to the National Museum of the Royal Navy in 2012. She continues to be flagship of the Second Sea Lord and is the oldest naval ship still in commission - this means if she was needed the Navy could sail her into battle.","Famous warship HMS Victory will undergo make-over to save it for nation .

"Each winter, the NHS crisis takes the same form: A&E departments across the country overwhelmed, the target for patients to be seen within four hours broken, operations cancelled. Add to that reports of ambulances being unable to deliver their charges on arrival into casualty departments, and you have the usual sad winter litany of a health service at bay. Each time, doctors and nurses struggle through. But each time, it takes us one step closer to a nightmare scenario – the collapse of perhaps the nation’s most cherished institution. Scroll down for video . Frank Field: 'I may be accused of scare-mongering, of exaggerating the threat to our universal, free- at-the-point-of-use health service, but in my view, nothing short of a revolution is required' NHS Plan? Field said he does not see a plan from either the Tories under David Cameron or from his own party under Ed Miliband, pictured, . I may be accused of scare-mongering, of exaggerating the threat to our universal, free- at-the-point-of-use health service. But in my view, nothing short of a revolution is required – a radical rescue plan to save the NHS from financial meltdown and to take it out of day-to-day party political control. Sadly, I see no such plan from either the Tories under David Cameron or, I regret to say, my own party under Ed Miliband. Instead, where we should see far-sighted vision, we are getting sticking plasters and short-term palliatives to hide the problem until post-Election. It’s as if our political leaders are too scared to tell the truth or, to put it another way, the doctor is too timid to tell the patient how bad their condition really is. So let me. The health service is facing potentially its worst financial crisis in its 66-year history. By 2020, on current plans, there will be a £30 billion shortfall in its budget. The figure is already known. It has been flagged up now for months. The causes are also well known. We’re an ageing population. While longer lifespans are one of the blessings of the age, they come at huge cost as older people use the health service more. Crisis: Field said the health service is facing potentially its worst financial crisis in its 66-year history . Also, the advances in medicine now being realised come at a huge cost. What was untreatable 40 years ago is now curable – but at a price. Less exciting, but just as important in budget terms, inflationary pressures always hit the NHS harder than much of the rest of the public sector. So while the Coalition has in principle protected health service spending and ring-fenced it from wider cutbacks, in real terms, its budget has been cut. If all that wasn’t bad enough, we know that even after five years of austerity, further massive public spending cutbacks await whoever holds the keys to No 10 Downing Street after the General Election in May. Therefore, without radical treatment, the prospects for the NHS are not just bleak, they are catastrophic. If nothing is done, within a few short years, the health service as we know it will have ceased to exist. A&E departments will not just be overstretched, they will be unrecognisable. Instead of queues reaching to the waiting room doors, they will be stretching into the streets. Waiting lists will grow like Topsy and slashing the number of operations will be standard. GP services will have to be drastically reduced as their budgets are slashed. A growing number of hospitals will go bankrupt and staff, dedicated and highly trained, laid off. In other hospitals, regimes reminiscent of the disgraceful events in Mid Staffordshire will be in place, with patients left un-nursed and unfed for long periods of time. Such a scenario, one would have thought, would now be igniting the most intense debate between the Tory and Labour parties on how this catastrophe can be averted. But that thought would be wrong. Both major parties hope to get past May 7 without any serious debate with you, the electorate, on the existential crisis facing our NHS. If they are planning to avert this national calamity, it is being kept well under wraps. In my own party’s case, time is running out as far as our traditional polling advantage on the NHS is concerned. One poll shows that David Cameron is more trusted than Ed Miliband on safeguarding the NHS. Labour is now promising to publish radical plans to put the NHS on a financially sustainable footing. But so far, the party shows no signs of facing up to the scale of the challenge. They intend to use money from a mansion tax, a crackdown on hedge funds and a levy on tobacco firms but this will simply not cover the £30 billion deficit. QUITE simply, the way we fund the NHS needs to be revolutionised – starting with a serious increase in National Insurance contributions that will raise a huge proportion of the necessary cash. I suspect both parties know such a genuinely radical move is necessary; they are just scared of being the first to say so. But why? Poll after poll says the electorate is up for contributing more money, not only to stave off a health catastrophe, but to help to reshape the NHS to match their needs in the 21st Century. In fact, one survey showed that 60 per cent of voters were happy to pay more. That is why I propose that the extra cash the NHS desperately needs should be levied through a reformed NI system. A rise of one per cent in NI contributions will raise £15 billion over the next five years – half the impending health service deficit. But to save the NHS, we have to go further. We should do nothing short of split off the health service from day-to-day political control to create an NHS Mk II – one truly owned and run by the people through a new national mutual, of which we will all be members. We would elect our own trustees and they would be responsible for spending the NHS budget, pushing through reforms and settling with us what future contributions should be. Pushing through reforms would be a key part of that new NHS mutual’s responsibilities and would deliver the productivity increases needed to meet the other half of the NHS deficit. And those reforms are crucial as the new NHS must realise more quickly than the old version that it cannot always expect taxpayers to stump up any money for any bill presented. It must also recognise that it can no longer deliver a world-class service through institutions devised by the Victorians for an age when there were few treatments and even fewer drugs. This age of the dominance of hospitals has to end. Many health staff are better located in easy-to-access health centres where treatments can take place at most within days. Likewise, any NHS true to its first principles of treatment free at the point of use will follow the lead of the last Labour Government and use the private sector to gain a better deal for us as patients and taxpayers. So, a revolutionised NHS outside day-to-day control of politicians and free to deliver the best treatment in the world for decades to come. Unthinkable? Too radical even to contemplate? Tell that to the people who did the unthinkable and set up the NHS in 1948. lMr Field is MP for Birkenhead.","The health service is facing potentially its worst financial crisis .

"When some of the world's first aviation pioneers tried to reach the skies centuries ago, they inflated hot air balloons. And now Nasa are looking into inflatable technology once more, this time as a way of reaching the next frontier in human space travel - Mars. Scientists are considering using a blow-up heat shield, which resembles stacking ring of doughnuts that young children play with, for future missions to the red planet. Scientists are considering using an inflatable heat shield, which resembles stacking ring of doughnuts that young children play with, for future missions to Mars . An inflatable heat shield, such as the one pictured, could help a future spacecraft slow down enough to enter Mars' atmosphere . Nasa engineers believe a lightweight, inflatable heat shield could be deployed to slow the craft to enter a Martian atmosphere, which is much thinner than Earth's. Such an inflatable heat shield could help a spacecraft reach the high-altitude southern plains of Mars and other areas that would otherwise be inaccessible under existing technology. The experts say rockets alone can't be used to land a large craft on Mars, as can be done on the Moon. Parachutes also will not work for a large spacecraft needed to send humans to Mars, they add. The rings would be filled with nitrogen and covered with a thermal blanket. Once deployed for landing, the rings would sit on top of the spacecraft, resembling a giant mushroom. Neil Cheatwood, Nasa's senior engineer for advanced entry, descent and landing systems at their base in Langley, Virginia, said: 'We try to not use propulsion if we don't have to. We make use of that atmosphere as much as we can, because it means we don't have to carry all that fuel with us.' The scientists now aim to test how inflatable spacecraft technology performs upon re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Once deployed for landing, the rings would sit on top of the spacecraft, resembling a giant mushroom . The scientists now aim to test how inflatable spacecraft technology performs upon re-entry into Earth's atmosphere . The test, scheduled for 2016, is important because NASA officials believe the shield could help them land astronauts on Mars and return larger loads of supplies from the International Space Station. New technology is needed because the type of spacecraft that would land humans on the red planet would be much larger than anything that has landed on the planet previously and current heat shield technology is too heavy. Nasa engineers have been working on the inflatable technology for about a decade, and believe it is close to being ready for operational use. 'If I had the budget and we had the funding to do it, I think we could get as large a scale as needed for humans in five to ten years,' Mr Cheatwood said. New technology is needed because the type of spacecraft that would land humans on the red planet would be much larger than anything that has landed on the planet previously . He said the same inflatable technology could also be used for spacecraft to explore other planets or objects with atmospheres, such as Venus, Titan and Jupiter. Because the inflatables are made of lightweight material and filled with nitrogen, more room is left aboard a spacecraft for science experiments and other things astronauts will need. The inflatable is covered by a thermal blanket of layers of heat-resistant materials. Anthony Calomino, principal investigator for materials and structures for hypersonic re-entry at Langley, said: 'The idea is that you would have something that could be packed up, put in a very small volume and then deployed into a very large size.' He said in a statement in April: 'Think airbag, something we could pack into compressed volume that will fit the size limits of a launch shroud, but allow for a much larger aeroshell.'","Nasa plan to test inflatable technology in their quest to put people on Mars .

"Half of all jobs at the BBC are only open to Corporation insiders, according to newly uncovered official figures. Thousands of vacancies at the State-funded broadcaster are never advertised publicly, meaning that only people who already work at the BBC are able to apply for them. Bosses say the policy is necessary to avoid having to make too many staff redundant during a string of re-organisations - but recruitment experts warn that they could be 'restricting the talent base' by failing to hire workers from outside. Scroll down for video . Insiders: This website advertises hundreds of jobs at the BBC which are only available to current employees of the Corporation . The BBC has previously faced accusations of cronyism after it emerged that senior executives had been offered jobs paying six-figure salaries which had not been advertised on the open market. Now figures obtained by MailOnline show that across the Corporation as a whole, half of all job vacancies are advertised only on an internal BBC forum - or not at all. Between January 2013 and November 2014, there were 6,766 vacancies at the BBC, of which only 3,498 - or 51.7 per cent - were advertised externally. The remaining 3,268 jobs were only advertised within the BBC, according to the data which were provided by the Corporation following a Freedom of Information request. The BBC hires outsourcing giant Capita to run its recruitment procedures, with jobs advertised via the publicly accessible BBC Jobs website as well as other media outlets such as local and national newspapers. However, the site has an additional section which can be accessed only by users with an internal BBC log-in username and password, and contains many more job vacancies than the external sections. Row: Director general Lord Hall has been at the centre of controversy over the hiring of senior executives at the BBC . Most jobs are initially advertised only in the internal section of the website, then advertised publicly if there is no suitable internal candidate, according to a BBC spokesman. The Corporation says it has to prioritise insiders for jobs because of the hundreds of posts which have been eliminated over the past few years as a result of the licence fee being frozen by the Government since 2010. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'As part of our drive to save £1.5billion the BBC is restructuring and cutting the number of posts we have - so when we do need to recruit priority consideration is given to internal candidates in order to save on redundancy costs.' A union source suggested that this was nothing more than 'good HR practice' - but an employment lawyer warned that closing off job opportunities could leave the BBC liable to discrimination claims if it cannot prove that it has encouraged applications from all sectors of society. 'The biggest risk by not advertising externally is restricting the talent base,' said Philip Pepper, a partner at Midlands-based law firm Shakespeares. 'You run the risk that you're actually restricting your workforce - so you could risk a claim [for discrimination]. 'Public authorities have a greater commitment to equality. They would generally offer the jobs externally as well as internally.' However, Mr Pepper also said that organisations 'have a duty to avoid redundancy', adding that employers are less likely to face a claim from a laid-off worker if they can show that they have made a reasonable attempt to rehire him or her in a different job. Official guidelines from the Equality and Human Rights Commission state that employers should consider advertising vacancies publicly in order to attract a diverse range of applicants. Guidance based on the Equality Act 2010 reads: 'If an employer doesn't advertise at all or advertises in a way that won't reach people with a particular protected characteristic, this might in some situations lead to indirect discrimination, unless the employer can objectively justify their approach. 'This is because not advertising or only advertising in a very limited way may stop people with a particular protected characteristic finding out about a job, which could count as worse treatment.' Headquarters: The BBC - based at Broadcasting House, pictured - says its policy is down to the need to avoid redundancies while re-structuring the organisation . In recent months comedian Lenny Henry has led a campaign to increase diversity in the BBC and criticised managers for not giving enough ethnic minority broadcasters a chance to display their talents. In general, opportunities for private sector workers to move into the public sector are currently extremely rare - separately to the BBC's hiring policy, the Civil Service has imposed a 'freeze on external recruitment' which means that nearly all job vacancies are filled by candidates who are already civil servants. The BBC came under fire last year over the hiring of senior executives, many of whom apparently landed their high-profile jobs without having to apply for them. Director general Lord Hall, who was hired in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal, appointed a number of managers, including his former colleague Anne Bulford and ex-Cabinet minister James Purnell, to positions which had not been publicly advertised. And in November, the BBC revealed to Press Gazette that several senior journalists had been hired to fill jobs which were not even advertised within the Corporation. The organisation refuses to discuss the hiring of most of its best-known faces - such as economics editor Robert Peston and Newsnight presenter Evan Davis - because they fall under the banner of 'talent' and are therefore exempt from Freedom of Information laws.","Only 52% of BBC job vacancies  are advertised externally, new figures show .

"The seven-year-old survivor of a horror plane crash that killed her family tried to wake up her dead parents before struggling on to safety, it has emerged. The horrific crash killed the parents, sister and cousin of Sailor Gutzler, who was left alone in a forest after dark with a broken wrist and almost a mile away from any help. But before she struggled through the thick brush, the child tried to wake up her dead relatives, thinking they might be asleep. Sailor tried to rouse the family members to no avail. She told Larry Wilkins, whose door she ended up at after her desperate walk to safety, but they 'wouldn't wake up', according to ABC News. Found her way: Sailor Gutzler, seven, walked barefoot with broken bones through thorns in the dark to find help . Wreckage: The plane, headed from Florida to Illinois, crashed over Kentucky Friday night . A Kentucky State police spokesman also said: 'She indicated to us that she believed her family was deceased but that she hoped they were just sleeping.' It came as remaining relatives set up a fund to provide for the girl. A family spokesman said: 'The Gutzler family mourns the loss of Marty, Kim and Piper Gutzler and Sierra Wilder. 'We are devastated by this loss, but are confident that they rest in God's loving arms. We ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time. Please pray for us, especially for Sailor Gutzler.' He said the fund, 'for the benefit of Sailor Gutzler'. is active at sailorgutzlerfund.com. The seven-year-old girl who survived a plane crash that killed everyone else on board used a stick lit with fire to find her way through 0.75 miles of thorny woodland to find help. Sailor Gutzler dragged herself out of the private twin-engine plane on Friday evening with broken bones to see her mother, father, sister and cousin were dead. Bloodied and traumatized, she used the burning wreckage to fashion a makeshift torch to guide her way through the Kentucky forest until she saw a light on in a house. She reportedly employed survival skills her dad taught her to stay alive. The dramatic details of Sailor's night come from 71-year-old Larry Wilkins: the man who opened his door at 6.30pm (7.30pm ET) to find the little girl shaken on his porch. Tragic: Sailor (pictured left and far right) saw her mother, father, and sister Piper (all pictured right) were dead . Trauma: The family had all been in Florida for the holidays to visit Sailor's adult brother in the military . 'I opened the door and this little girl was standing there with bloody nose, bloody legs and bloody arms,' Mr Wilkins told NBC. 'Her voice was quivering. She told me her mom and dad were dead and she was in a plane crash and the plane was upside down. 'She was bleeding pretty bad, her legs were bleeding, her face had a bloody nose. 'She was barefoot, only had one sock on. 'She asked if she could stay here,' Wilkins recalled. He immediately called 911 and then went to work cleaning up the bloodied girl with a washcloth. When police arrived, the little girl was so shaken up she could hardly make herself understood. 'Her voice was quivering': When police arrived, Sailor was so shaken she wasn't making any sense . Survivor: Her parents, sister and cousin had died, and she used a stick lit by flames to guide her through . Shocked: Larry Wilkins found Sailor on his doorstep and took her in before calling 911 . 'I felt so sorry for her, tears come my eyes,' said Wilkins who described the little girl's journey as 'very, very rough territory.' The plane had taken off from Key West in Florida, where Sailor was visiting her adult brother Nick Brink with father, Marty Gutzler, 49, mother Kimberly Gutzler, 45, her nine-year-old daughter, Piper, and her cousin 14-year-old Sierra Wilder. They were heading home to Mount Vernon, Illinois, when the plane reported engine troubles. The crash killed everyone on board except for Sailor.

'She literally fell out of the sky into a dark hole and didn't have anybody but her own will to live and get help for her family,' White told the Associated Press. 'Absolutely amazing.' He told NBC: 'She's upside down in an aircraft that's crash-landed, she is in shorts and a t-shirt, she's seven years old, she has broken bones, she pulls herself out of the aircraft, she's in a place where she doesn't see any lights, she walks through thorns, briers, a 12-foot ditch, and continues to walk in that environment with no shoes on until she sees a light on in a house.' The family who died in a plane crash in Kentucky were traveling home from visiting their son at a naval base in Florida when their plane went down near KY 810 South in Lyon County. Family friend Troy Dunbar, who worked at Mr Gutzler's furniture store in Nashville, IL, told Heartland News, Mrs Gutlzer's adult son, Nick Brink, is in the military stationed in Key West and the family were coming back from visiting for the holidays. A spokesman for the family, Kent Plotner, issued a statement Saturday afternoon that read: 'The Gutzler family mourns the loss of Marty, Kim and Piper Gutzler and Sienna Wilder. 'We are devastated by this loss, but are confident that they rest in God's loving arms. Please pray for us, especially for Sailor Gutzler.' Sgt.

Before his meal, on the 14th day of his Christmas vacation, Obama worked out at a gym on the Marine Corps base near his rented vacation home in the small town of Kailua outside Honolulu. He then signed an executive order imposing fresh sanctions on North Korea. The penalties target the North's defense industry and spy service in an attempt to punish Pyongyang for a crippling cyberattack against Sony. Obama's spokesman said he then called the Democrat's Senate leader Harry Reid to wish him a speedy recovery. The 75-year-old broke several ribs and facial bones on Thursday when a piece of exercise equipment snapped at his Nevada home.

"Five million retired workers could be given the right to sell their private sector pensions for cash under plans being considered by ministers. Pensions Minister Steve Webb is pushing for landmark pension reforms in last year’s Budget to be extended to those who have already retired. Under the changes announced by George Osborne last year, savers will no longer have to use their pensions to buy an annuity – a financial product that pays an annual income until a retiree dies. Instead they will be able to cash in all or part of their savings for immediate use. Pensions minister Steve Webb wants to let people who have already retired cash in their annuities for a lump sum . But the changes do not currently apply to existing pensioners, meaning those who have already bought an annuity will miss out on the new freedoms. The plans do not affect the state pension. Yesterday Mr Webb, a Liberal Democrat who has been the architect of many of the Coalition’s pensions reforms, said: ‘I want to see people trusted with their own money wherever possible. I have already heard from people around the country who would like to see this change made. ‘I want to see if we can get these freedoms extended to those who are receiving an annuity, but who might prefer a cash lump sum. ‘No one would be obliged to do so, but for those who would prefer up-front capital to regular income, I can see no reason why this should not be an option.’ Under the latest plans, pensioners would be able to sell their annuities to the highest bidder, potentially unlocking tens of thousands of pounds. Mr Webb said there was ‘considerable interest and enthusiasm’ within the pensions industry for the idea. The change is unlikely to be put in place before the election. Mr Webb said he is currently seeking cross-party agreement to get the plan implemented in the next parliament. Critics say many annuities offer poor value for money, with pensioners offered miserly rates in return for their life savings. Pensions experts last night gave the proposal a mixed reception. 'I want to see people trusted with their own money wherever possible,' said pension minister Steve Webb . Ros Altmann, an adviser to government on older workers, said the scheme was potentially ‘workable’. But she warned it would need a ‘radical change of mindset’, and said pensioners would have to be wary of potentially high charges when cashing in investments. Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdowne, said the proposal was ‘not a bad idea in principle’, but added there were major practical difficulties, especially for those who decided they still want to buy annuities. He said: ‘The principle of allowing people to take back control over their own money is fine and consistent with the Government’s other reforms. ‘But it takes two to tango, and even where you have a customer who wants to cash in, they still have to find an insurance company who is willing to offer them a good deal. ‘The one thing that insurance companies will not want is all the sick and ill people taking out their money, because they effectively subsidise the people who live longer. ‘So you could well be in a situation where people would have to undergo an individual underwriting process. It could be pretty challenging.’ The latest figures from the pensions industry suggest there are about six million active annuities in the UK paying out a combined total of £11billion a year. But some people have more than one pension, and the Department for Work and Pensions estimates that about five million people in total are in receipt of annuity payments. Loyal savers are receiving the worst interest rates since records began, figures show. Rates have plunged to their lowest level in 15 years, with customers now getting an average of just 1.8 per cent on fixed-term savings accounts. Despite being among the worst-paying accounts in Britain, these have names such as Halifax’s ‘Liquid Gold’ – offering just 0.05 per cent – and Lloyds Bank’s ‘Platinum Saver’ which has a 0.1 per cent rate. The elderly have been particularly affected by plummeting savings rates, as many rely on the interest on a nest egg to boost their pension income. The Bank of England said the record low applied to accounts where you cannot withdraw your savings before a set date. But accounts which allow easier access to cash are also paying near-record lows, at just 0.76 per cent on average. The Bank of England’s base rate has been set at 0.5 per cent since March 2009, which has dragged down savings rates. In addition, the Government’s 2012 Funding for Lending scheme allowed banks to borrow £80billion cheaply from the Bank of England, meaning they no longer needed savers to fund loans. Sylvia Waycot, of Moneyfacts.co.uk, said many pensioners ‘have saved all their lives hoping to reap the rewards now, but they are not’.","New plans could see millions of retired workers given right to sell pension .

"A couple who had a fantasy treehouse built outside their house, complete with a full kitchen, working bathroom and a viewing deck, have been told they have to strip parts of it away to comply with planning law. Mike and Pat Splinter had a 500 square foot house, supported by concrete struts and with full plumbing and electricity, set up in their garden over Christmas. The ambitious construction was created for the Treehouse Masters series on Animal Planet, and featured in their festive special episode. Scroll down for video . Paradise lost: This elaborate treehouse, belonging to Mike Splinter (pictured), will have to have its bedroom and kitchen gutted to satisfy planning officials in Sacramento, California . Violation: Planning bosses in Placer County say that the Splinters do not have permission for a working kitchen - so must scrap it . On the show, designer Pete Nelson came to their vineyard in Sacramento, California, to set up the stunning home-away-from-home while the owners were away, at a cost of more than $60,000. When they came back Nelson and the Splinters made candy canes in the treehouse's working kitchen, which led it to be dubbed the Christmas Candy Kitchen treehouse. But, according to the Sacramento Bee newspaper, the home got on the wrong side of planning bosses in Placer County, who say the extravagant treehouse oversteps the mark and has to be scaled back. Dramatic: The threehouse is supported by concrete posts, is fully plumbed and has electricity . Lush: The construction, which cost more than $60,000, is richly furnished inside . The Splinters (pictured, center left and center right, at a family party) had the house set up over Christmas . They have demanded that the kitchen be stripped out, as well as the mattress in the treehouse's loft bedroom. The county's deputy planning director, E.J. Ivaldi, said: 'They can use it for entertaining.' 'What the county approved was a residential accessory structure. 'For the purpose of them being able to do a TV show, they were allowed to build a kitchen with the understanding that the kitchen would come out.' Officials say the harsh criteria are being applied because the couple already has a full guest cottage elsewhere on their vineyard.

"An Iowa family was left shocked and confused after their three-year-old daughter died from the flu not even three days after she fell ill. Ayzlee McCarthy, of Elk Horn, spent December 26 running around the house with her siblings and playing with her Christmas gifts: dress-up clothes and a doll of the snowman Olaf from the Disney movie 'Frozen.' A day later, her legs ached so badly, she couldn't walk. Then on December 28, Ayzlee was rushed to a hospital in Des Moines and hooked up to an IV. She died the following morning, just 13 days after her third birthday, of influenza A and B with sepsis, The Des Moines Register reported. Three-year-old Ayzlee McCarthy spent the day after Christmas running around her parents' house in Iowa. The day after, she began showing symptoms of the illness that would cut her life far too short . Ayzlee died of influenza A and B with sepsis just three days later, not even two weeks after her third birthday . Her distraught mother, Amber McCarthy, is struggling to understand. 'She was healthy, she had a flu shot — the whole thing is so unreal,' Amber McCarthy told the Des Moines Register. 'This shouldn't be happening in 2015,' the mother added. Ayzlee was an active child, known for her infectious excitement and love of singing popular tunes like 'Let It Go' from 'Frozen.' She was proud of having recently completed potty training. Dad Jim McCarthy holds a newborn Ayzlee as the family celebrated their first Christmas with her in 2011 . Her parents say Ayzlee had spent the day after Christmas running around the house with her siblings. Nothing seemed amiss. McCarthy took her daughter to a nearby clinic when she began complaining that her legs ached badly. The mother, a respiratory therapist, at first thought she could have a urinary tract infection. Happier times: dad Jim holds his 'feisty' baby girl . 'She tested positive for both [influenza] A and B,' McCarthy told the Register. 'I never in a million years thought that was what we'd be at the clinic for.' McCarthy took her daughter home made sure she drank plenty of fluids and gave her ibuprofen. Ayzlee seemed to be feeling better on December 27. She watched cartoons while her mom cooked for her. 'I made her some toast, and she told me what a good 'cooker' I was,' McCarthy told the Register. But later in the day, something changed. 'She sat there looking through me and not at me,' the mother told the Register. 'I knew something was not right.' McCarthy took her to a nearby hospital, where Ayzlee was hooked up to an IV and seemed to not recognize her mother. She was eventually transferred to Blank Children's Hospital in Des Moines, but her condition continued to worsen. 'She kept saying how tired she was,' McCarthy, who spent the night lying with Ayzlee in her hospital bed, told the Register. Then about 4am on December 29, woke up to her daughter's labored breathing and racing heart. 'Mommy, I so tired,' Ayzlee said. 'I done.' McCarthy told her daughter she loved her as nurses intubated her. Her heart stopped beating as the mother watched the procedure from the hallway. 'They tried three times to bring her back,' McCarthy told the Register. 'I said, ""Keep doing it.""' By the time McCarthy's husband Jim arrived, Ayzzlee still had a weak heart rate. The parents went in and told their little girl they loved her one last time. She died minutes later.

"The family of missing toddler William Tyrell have endured a heart-rending Christmas, with a stockpile of unopened presents from locals serving as a sombre reminder of his disappearance. Members of the Kendall Services and Citizens Club in NSW gave a collection of gifts and Spiderman merchandise to his parents in the hope that the three-year-old will soon be found. One of the senior officers in the investigation has said the family remain heartbroken at William's baffling disappearance almost four months ago. After news that homicide detectives are now leading the investigation, an expansive search of the surrounding areas has led them to believe that the boy did not wander away on his own accord, reports The Sunday Telegraph - with one neighbour suggesting he could have been kidnapped.

'They indicated to me that Christmas was just a quiet silent time at home, the emptiness of having a void in their house,' lead investigator Superintendent Paul Fehon, from Port Macquarie Local Area Command, told The Sunday Telegraph. 'That's been unopened presents, not able to share the festivities, to see a smile on young William's face to receive gifts or presents like any other normal child.' Supt Fehon said a lack of evidence to support the potential scenarios has left investigators baffled. 'It's got to be either adventure that's turned into misadventure, or human intervention. Because we're not finding anything on that side, we've got to be open to the possibility of human intervention,' he said. His parents have also made a poignant announcement: 'We pray that 2015 brings William home.' Supt Fehon said police were considering the importance of a walking track which starts at the end of Benaroon Drive where William disappeared and leads into the nearby Kendall cemetery.

The family had visited Kendall before, with locals recalling seeing them the previous December. Another neighbour said the community has been rocked by William’s disappearance, with children no longer allowed to ride their bikes or visit the local store without supervision. William was last seen in the front yard of his grandmother's house at Kendall, on the NSW mid-north coast . Investigators have now also outlined a detailed account of the sequence of events before William's disappearance . In a major turn for the investigation, murder squad officers are now leading inquiries - meaning the case is no longer a missing persons investigation. Homicide Squad boss Detective Superintendent Michael Willing told the Sunday Telegraph that the investigation had taken a new direction.

"Acting is in the blood: Georgina Baillie, above, as she is today . When Georgina Baillie makes her debut in Harold Pinter's The Homecoming this month, it will be the final chapter in the dramatic transformation from the debauched public image she presented when she embroiled her family in the 'Sachsgate' scandal. It should be a moment of happiness and joy for Georgina, as she follows in the acting footsteps of her 84-year-old grandfather Andrew Sachs, who played hapless Spanish waiter Manuel in classic 1970s sitcom Fawlty Towers. But when she takes to the stage, Georgina, who has spent the past 14 months at drama school, will look out on a heartbreaking sight: the two seats that she has reserved for her grandparents will instead remain empty for the entire evening. For even now, six years after The Mail on Sunday highlighted how Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross taunted Sachs on a BBC Radio 2 show with an account of Baillie's sexual antics, Sachs and his wife Melody still cannot bring themselves to forgive her. Despite a brief reconciliation in 2013, the relationship between the two parties has once again broken down – even though Georgina, 29, insists that she has buried her wild past and wants to become a serious actress. 'I want to make things right between me and my grandparents,' Georgina says. 'I love and miss them so much. I know how I behaved back then was wrong, but I'm not that person any more. 'If only they would see me perform… then they could see for themselves. Grandad always said I needed to grow up and change. 'Well, I've more than done that. I'm just so sad that he's not here now to give me advice while I'm trying to launch my acting career.' When the Sachsgate affair ignited in 2008, Miss Baillie, then aged 23, was part of a burlesque dance group called Satanic Sluts whose performances featured 'sexy striptease and slutty activity'. And it was Brand's obscene phone call to her grandfather during his radio show, in which he boasted of sleeping with Miss Baillie, that forced her sleazy past into the public spotlight. The distress and humiliation it caused Sachs was then sharpened by his granddaughter's decision to furnish the tabloids with details of her sex life with Brand. Scroll down for video . The Sachs family with their grandchildren in the 1990s. Georgina Baillie is circled . 'I admit I was a nightmare in my early 20s,' she says. 'I mixed with the wrong people. 'I experimented with sexuality, with drugs, with everything. I made mistakes, and unfortunately some of them were on film. 'If I could go back and have a word with my 20-year-old self and tell her, 'Don't you dare', then I would. 'I've tried so hard over the years to repair my relationship with my grandparents. I've sent letters, flowers, emails – but I never heard anything back for years. 'They were understandably angry at me for talking to the press and for how I behaved with Russell. 'They are not getting any younger and I'm so frightened that I might never see either of them again. 'Drama school is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. It's been harder than being at the centre of a press scandal, harder than touring with a rock band. I've never worked so hard in my life.' In truth, Georgina's relationship with her grandparents first soured before Sachsgate. When she was 20 she lost the deposit they generously put down on a rental flat for her. The old me: Georgina wants to put her outrageous past behind her . She says: 'The flat turned into a party house. I basically trashed it and lost my grandparents' deposit. They quite rightly weren't happy with me about that and I fully admit I behaved terribly. But I apologised and things had got better between us by the time everything kicked off in 2008. 'I actually used the money I earned out of speaking to the press to pay back their deposit. I sent them a cheque, but I never heard anything from them.' When the row over Sachsgate finally subsided, Georgina decided to focus on her singing and was taken under the wing of 1980s pop star Adam Ant. She spent three years touring the world with his support act, a girl band called Poussez Posse. 'My grandparents heard about me touring with Adam and were really impressed with how hard I was working. In January 2013, for the first time since 2008, they wanted to see me. I was so happy. 'We sat down and had a chat about everything and I thought we'd put everything that had happened in the past behind us. 'It was so lovely to see them, but at the same time I was really sad to see how my grandad had got a lot older and I'd missed all that precious time with him.' Georgina also received an invitation to her grandmother's 80th birthday celebrations at The Ivy in London, but says it was withdrawn at the last minute. 'A few days before the party, Grandma saw Adam on Jonathan Ross's chat show and, for some reason, it upset her so much she uninvited me,' she reveals. 'I was completely devastated and I phoned Grandma to tell her how hurt I was to suddenly be dismissed again. I told her how I thought it was really unfair, but she didn't like me telling her that, and I got cut out of their lives again.' She adds: 'I just want a fresh start. I'm going to turn 30 this year, my acting career is about to begin and I want a clean slate. 'I just want to make up with them and put everything that happened with Russell Brand behind me.' Having always wanted to 'follow in my grandad's footsteps' as a youngster, Georgina has only recently begun to consider acting seriously. During a break from touring with Adam Ant, she decided to do a four-day acting course at The Poor School, a drama school in King's Cross, London. Six years ago Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand taunted Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter's  sexual antics . 'To my surprise the director offered me a place on the two-year training course there and then,' she says. 'I was really shocked. I hadn't really thought about going to drama school – I did the four-day course just to see if I was any good at acting. I spoke to Adam about it and he was really supportive and told me it was absolutely the right thing to do. 'Adam and I are like brother and sister – there's nothing sexual about our relationship. 'We see each other all the time. When we meet up he helps me to rehearse. He reads the other part and helps me learn my lines. He loves doing different voices and is actually quite good.' After a gruelling 14 months training she is now preparing for the school's public season. Later this month she will play the pivotal role of Ruth in The Homecoming in front of an audience of agents and casting directors. And she has also been cast in the school's musical theatre showcase, which will be performed to a public audience, opening on February 19. 'Above all, I just want my grandad to come and watch me. I want him to be proud of how hard I've worked. Six years on Andrew Sachs and his wife Melody cannot bring themselves to forgive Georgina . 'Ever since I was tiny he's always supported my ambition to be an actress and I'd love to be able to go to him for advice now, but I can't. At secondary school I played Audrey in As You Like It and Grandad was there in the audience, just like he was for all my school plays. 'He used to give me very honest feedback. He was always very proud of me, but he would give me constructive criticism too, as well as gross flattery.' Georgina's father Charles Baillie is also an actor, previously touring with the National Theatre, while her mother, Kate Sachs, is a voiceover artist. Georgina says: 'With both my grandad and my dad being actors, growing up I was always backstage at a theatre somewhere. I've been around actors my whole life. 'Acting is in my blood and I've wanted to be an actor since I was a little girl. I just got a bit waylaid. I remember one Christmas, Grandad was performing as Manuel in a cabaret act at the Bath Spa Hotel and we all went to watch him. 'I looked at him and thought, 'Wow, this isn't my grandad any more. All of a sudden he's somebody else. How cool is that?!' 'That really inspired me. They say that at drama school they break you down and build you back up again. Well, the teachers have worked extremely hard at breaking me down. But I'm grateful for it. There have been times when I've wanted to quit, but I've stuck with it and I'm coming out the other end. I just wish Grandad could see that too.' Despite Georgina's plea it seems unlikely that her grandparents will witness her new incarnation. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday last night, Melody Sachs, 82, said: 'We have loved that girl, funded her and looked after her and everything. But after what Georgie has done, I'm sorry we can never see her again. 'If she hadn't told him [Brand] who her grandfather was, this would never have happened. 'But they were sitting on the sofa together watching TV, I think they had actually just had sex, and when my husband came on screen she said, 'That's my grandfather.' 'The next day he made the call. It's been terrible we have been pursued ever since and never left alone. 'Russell Brand wrote us a letter apologising and has rung us several times. But the whole incident has destroyed our family.'","Georgina Baillie is the granddaughter of 84-year-old actor Andrew Sachs .

"David Cameron warned Brussels he is prepared to take Britain out of the EU if his demands are not met . David Cameron today warns Brussels that he is prepared to take Britain out of Europe – as he states his determination to serve a full second term in Downing Street. The Prime Minister – marking the effective start of the General Election campaign with an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday – declared just days before a meeting in London with German Chancellor Angela Merkel: ‘If I don’t get what is needed I rule nothing out.’ Mr Cameron, who pledges to ‘hit the ground running – and hard’ if he is re-elected in May, warns Labour’s budget plans would cost £13.5billion extra just in interest payments on the deficit, more than the police and transport budgets combined, if Ed Miliband became PM. He says: ‘This is the most important Election for a generation, a real choice between a continued competence or disaster. This is all about security from the Conservatives and the chaos you’d get from everybody else. If you lose control of your debt and deficit, you get massive cuts in things such as health and education. You get appalling insecurity, jobs lost, firms going overseas.’ The PM’s warning came as Labour launched its own campaign today with posters claiming that the NHS in its current form would not survive another five years of a Tory government. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said the health service would fall prey to a ‘toxic mix of cuts and privatisation’ if Mr Cameron was returned to No10. In a highly personal and wide-ranging interview, Mr Cameron promises to introduce reforming legislation on education and welfare within the first 50 days of a new Government, says that he is so close to Barack Obama that the American President calls him ‘bro’, reveals that he authorised the removal from the Tory candidates list of an aide to Home Secretary Theresa May, and tells Boris Johnson that he will have to wait for a Cabinet seat. Amid speculation at Westminster about his political future if he does not win a convincing victory in May, or if he is felled by Tory European rebels unhappy about his strategy over the 2017 EU referendum, Mr Cameron says he is determined to stay in Downing Street until 2020: ‘We have to see it through,’ he says. The Prime Minister said his discussions with Mrs Merkel on Wednesday would include the so-called ‘red lines’ – areas of national policy which he needs to be repatriated to the UK if his Government is to back a vote to remain in the European Union.

The Prime Minister said his discussions with Mrs Merkel on Wednesday would include the so-called ‘red lines’ – areas of national policy which he needs to be repatriated to the UK from Europe . The PM also revealed that he is close to Barack Obama that the U.S. President calls him 'bro' ‘The key areas are safeguarding the single market, getting out of ever closer union, being able to veto regulations and a package of measures on welfare,’ he says. Labour’s high command today launches a four-month campaign to prove that the NHS would not ‘survive another five years of David Cameron’, claiming that cutbacks would lead to nearly two million waiting longer than four hours at casualty departments and more than 20 million patients left waiting a week or more to see a GP. But the attack was immediately blunted when former Labour welfare minister Frank Field said his own party showed no signs of facing up to the ‘existential crisis’ engulfing the health service. In an article for The Mail on Sunday, the senior Labour MP accused Mr Miliband of coming up with ‘sticking plasters and short-term palliatives’ for the NHS, not the ‘far-sighted vision’ needed to save the service from extinction. Mr Field also accused Mr Cameron of being too scared to tell voters what needed to be done to save the NHS.","David Cameron warns Brussels he is prepared to take Britain out of the EU .

"Hundreds of ambulances specially designed to deal with obese patients weighing more than 50 stone have been rolled out across the UK. Ambulance chiefs are planning to upgrade their fleet with wider doors, a stretcher for patients weighing 56 stone  and a device which can carry a person  up to 34 stone down a flight of stairs. A quarter of British adults are obese. Experts said spending up to £100,000 for specialist ambulances demonstrates the need for tougher measures to stop people becoming overweight. A reinforced, wider ambulance (right), compared with a normal vehicle designed to carry extra-heavy patients . Ambulance services began introducing small numbers of specially equipped 'bariatric' vehicles about four years ago to deal with the growing obesity epidemic. But figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act revealed how there are now more than 800 ambulances in the UK equipped to deal with obese patients. One trust, the East of England Ambulance Service, recently trialled the new wider ambulances and over a period of eight months, were called upon 260 times. The most common call-outs were for falls or patients with blood poisoning. Paramedics said it is also now common for them to treat patients housebound by their weight. Tracy Nicholls of the East of England Ambulance Service, a council member of the College of Paramedics, said: 'A lot of the time we're only finding patients when they reach crisis point because they haven't sought the routine checks and help they need out of embarrassment or simply because they cannot get out of the house. 'We have situations where two or three ambulances and a fire truck arrive in a street and we have to remove a window to get the patient out of their home and that attracts a lot of attention and can be just awful for that person. 'It is really important to paramedics that they can treat patients, who are often collapsed or in an awkward situation, with dignity.  Having the right equipment and training is a big part of that. 'We don't want to be in a situation where we can't treat a patient because of their size - they deserve a good service, just like everybody else.' There are now more than 800 ambulances in the UK equipped to deal with obese patients . The new ambulances include wider doors and a stretcher for patients weighing 56 stone . But Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum said more should be done to tackle the obesity crisis. He told the Times: 'There is no getting away from the fact that if you have these people, you have to cater for them and have extra-heavy ambulances. 'But what we're doing is spending a sack of money on treatment, when what we've really got to be doing is stopping people getting fat in the first place.' The East Midlands Ambulance Service said it operated 119 bariatric vehicles and aimed to upgrade its entire fleet by the end of 2017. It said this was a good use of funds as these vehicles could be used 24/7 whereas dedicated bariatric ambulances would sit idle until needed. South Western Ambulance Service said that 295 vehicles — 98 per cent of its fleet — could deal with bariatric patients. Yorkshire Ambulance Service said that, since 2009, all new vehicles had been bariatric capable and it operated 183 specialist ambulances. The South East Coast Ambulance Service has three bariatric vehicles in its fleet which were used 534 times in the past year. The Welsh Ambulance Service has 196 such vehicles. The West Midlands Ambulance Service said all of its vehicles were bariatric-capable but it owned or leased nine specialist ambulances . The North East Ambulance Service has two bariatric vehicles which it deployed 798 times in the past year. Although also used to deal with patients without weight problems, this is a huge increase from just 29 cases in 2008-09.","Now more than 800 ambulances in UK equipped to deal with obese patients .

Lady Carnarvon also chided guests for not concentrating on laying the table for breakfast the following morning. And she disclosed how her dogs chewed the TV remote control, causing the family to miss nearly 40 minutes of the two-hour Downton Abbey Christmas special.

"These pictures show the horrific injuries suffered by a golden retriever which was attacked by a stray Staffordshire bull terrier while it was on a walk in the park. Mary Towns, 54, was walking her dogs Harvey and Brie in a field near her house in Shiremoor, North Tyneside on Monday evening when the terrier came bounding towards them. With no owner in sight, the dog began tearing into 10-year-old Harvey and bit Mrs Town's hand as she tried to intervene and she was only saved when a group of teenagers stepped in. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Mary Towns (centre) with her dog Harvey, who was savagely attacked, and the teenagers that saved them - left to right, Max Sherwood, 13, Ethan Dembry-Edwards, 14, Ryan Cooke, 13 and Kai Mitchell, 13 . The dental nurse explained: 'It was about 6.30pm and I was walking in a field I often go to so I can throw a tennis ball, and I often see other dog walkers, but not that night. 'Then out of nowhere this Staffordshire cross came streaking across the field towards us. 'At first I thought it had come to play, but actually it had one thing in its mind and that was to attack Harvey again and again. There was no owner in sight, no lead and no collar.' The attack lasted about 10 minutes, while her four-year-old black Labrador ran off and found her way home. Kai Mitchell, Max Sherwood, Ryan Cooke - all 13 - and 14-year-old Ethan Dembry-Edwards came to her rescue and called emergency services when they realised she didn't have a phone. The boys also attempted to flag down help from a nearby road before officers were able to arrive on the scene and stop the animal. The Staffordshire bull terrier cross came bounding towards them in a field near her home in North Tyneside . Harvey, 10, was bitten more than 100 times on and around his neck, leaving Mrs Towns and her husband with a £1,000 vets bill . Harvey has now returned home and is on antibiotics and pain killers. Their other dog, Brie - a black Labrador - made a lucky escape in the attack and found her own way home . It was later put down after officers decided it was a danger to the public and no owner came forward. Mrs Towns suffered only minor injuries and bruising, but Harvey was left with more than a hundred bite marks on and around his neck leaving her and husband David with a £1,000 vets bill. 'It was a good thing my smaller dog escaped because she would have been killed without a question of a doubt,' she added. 'There was so much blood.' 'Harvey was very lucky and now he is back at home with antibiotics and pain killers we are hoping he will make a full recovery in time. 'I would like to say a huge thank you to the boys who helped me as I don't know what I would have done otherwise. 'People can be quick to moan about teenagers, but their families should be very proud because they could have just walked by and done nothing, but they stopped and helped.' Mrs Towns also suffered bites to her hands in the attack that lasted about 10 minutes before police arrived . Mrs Towns has thanked the four teenagers who were able to call emergency services for her because she did not have her phone with her and also attempted to flag down help from a nearby road . She added: 'People breed these animals and don't think about other people or the animals themselves. 'Dogs aren't born bad. It is people's handling of them that makes them bad. From my point of view, there is now a dangerous dog off our streets. 'I am an adult, but I could have been walking with my grandchild or there could have been young children around.

"It has been a national favourite for more than 100 years and can be found everywhere from ‘greasy spoon’ cafes to luxury hotels. But it now seems that brown sauce is increasingly being left on the shelf by consumers. Sales of the condiment fell by 19 per cent last year, according to industry analysts, with changing food tastes and a greater awareness of healthy eating thought to be behind the drop. Scroll down for video . Sales of brown sauce fell by 19 per cent last year, with the amount spent on the condiment dropping £8million . HP Sauce has been a national institution since it was created in 1895 by Nottingham grocer Frederick Gibson Garton, who claimed it was being served at the Houses of Parliament. Sir John Betjeman referenced it in his poem Lake District, while Harold Wilson’s wife once complained in a newspaper interview that the former Labour Prime Minister would ‘drown everything in HP Sauce’. However, figures from market research company Mintel show that sales of brown sauce fell from 16 million kilos in 2013 to 13 million kilos last year, with the amount spent on various brands dropping 17 per cent from £47 million to £39 million during the same period. Experts say that the public’s concerns over salt content, a decline in the popularity of cholesterol-busting dishes such as breakfast fry-ups, and the rising popularity of other breakfast foods such as porridge, have caused the decline. But despite the news, fans of the sauce are determined to prove that it hasn’t had its chips. Mail on Sunday food critic Tom Parker Bowles said: ‘A fry-up without HP is unthinkable, as is a bacon sandwich. ‘It’s a taste of Empire long past, and you’ll find it everywhere from Formica-topped cafe tables to the gilded magnificence of The Ritz. ‘It is a great British condiment, the perfect mixture of rich fruit and sharp vinegar. ‘Let’s hope the drop is a blip rather than long-term decline. This is an SOS – Save Our Sauce.’ Both HP Sauce - a national institution since its creation in 1895 - and tomato ketchup sales are down . Sales of tomato ketchup are also down, but not as steeply as brown sauce, mainly due to the large quantities consumed in fast-food outlets. Richard Ford, senior food analyst at Mintel, said: ‘Volume and value declines of brown sauce and ketchup reflect changing eating habits. The most common reason to forgo table sauces is a typical meal no longer requires them.’ A spokesman for Heinz, the American firm that bought the British brand in 2005 and which also owns rival Daddies, said: ‘This is at odds with our data and independent analysis. ‘HP Sauce has seen slightly lower value sales since smaller packs have proved popular. ‘However, sales of HP bottles are up two per cent, reflecting its ongoing popularity.’ Both HP and Daddies are made in the Netherlands, leaving the OK range by Norwich-based Colman’s as the UK’s only home-produced brown sauce.","Sales of brown sauce have dropped byy 19 per cent in the last year .

"Abu Anas al-Libi, A Libyan accused over the 1998 Al-Qaeda bombings of US embassies in Africa died on Friday . A Libyan accused over the 1998 Al-Qaeda bombings of US embassies in Africa died on Friday, days before he was to stand trial in New York, his lawyer and family said. Abu Anas al-Libi, 50, was on the FBI's most-wanted list with a $5 million price on his head when he was captured by US troops in the Libyan capital Tripoli in October 2013. He and Saudi businessman Khalid al-Fawwaz were due to stand trial on January 12 over the attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 244 people and wounded more than 5,000. Libi, a computer expert, died at a hospital in the New York area on Friday, his lawyer Bernard Kleinman told The Washington Post, saying the health of his client -- who had advanced liver cancer - had deteriorated significantly in the last month. Al-Libi's wife said Saturday her husband underwent liver surgery three weeks ago, went into a brief coma and was moved prematurely back to prison. She said the last time she spoke to al-Libi, 'his voice was weak and he was in a bad condition.' On Friday, she said a lawyer told her that al-Libi had been taken to a hospital and put on a ventilator. She added: 'He was dying then.' In a federal court filing Saturday, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said al-Libi died after being taken from New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center to a local hospital. 'Despite the care provided at the hospital, his condition deteriorated rapidly and (he) passed away,' Bharara wrote. Libi and Fawwaz both previously pleaded not guilty to conspiracy charges. A third suspect, Egyptian Adel Abdel Bary, last year pleaded guilty to playing a role in the 1998 attacks. Scroll down for video . An injured man is removed from the wreckage after an explosion near the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998. Abu Anas al-Libi is believed to have suggested bombing the embassy and performed surveillance in advance of the attack . FBI agents look for evidence through the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi debris. The bomb blast claimed the lives of at least 247 people and injured nearly 5,000 - an attack Abu Anas al-Libi is believed to have been involved in coordinating . Libi, who also suffered from hepatitis C, told a federal court in Manhattan in October that he had been on hunger strike when questioned by FBI agents - during which he made an incriminating statement. Looking pale and thin, and speaking very quietly through a translator, Libi told the court that he had told 'anyone who asked' that he was on a hunger strike. He was detained by US commandos on October 5, 2013, and interrogated on board a US warship before being handed over to FBI agents on October 12. Kleinman says Libi was innocent and had cut his ties with Al-Qaeda before the 1998 attacks. Libi's son Abdel Mouin told CNN by telephone from Tripoli early Saturday that his father had been in a coma before his death and that the family holds the US government 'fully responsible' for his demise. His wife, who asked to be identified as Um Abdullah, told The Associated Press that his experience only worsened his ailments. 'I accuse the American government of kidnapping, mistreating, and killing an innocent man. He did nothing,' Um Abdullah said. Al-Libi, which means 'of Libya' in Arabic, was his nom de guerre. Also known as Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, U.S. prosecutors in 2000 described al-Libi as sitting on a council that approved terrorist operations for al-Qaida, which would become infamous worldwide a year later after the September 11 terror attacks. Before that, al-Qaida's August 7, 1998, truck bombings at the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were its deadliest assault. The bombs tore through the embassies and nearby buildings, killing 213 people and wounding some 4,500 in Kenya alone. Abdullah al-Raghie (left), and Nabih al-Raghie, the son and brother respectively, of al-Qaeda suspect Abu Anas al-Libi speak to the press in Nofleine, near the Libyan capital Tripoli (file) The Tanzania attack, conducted minutes later, killed 11 people and wounded 85. Al-Libi, believed to be a computer specialist for al-Qaida, conducted visual and photographic surveillance of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in late 1993, the federal court indictment against him and others alleges. In 1994, he and other al-Qaida members researched alternate potential sites in Nairobi including the local office of the U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as 'British, French and Israeli targets,' according to the indictment. His path to Kenya and al-Qaida remains unclear. Al-Libi is believed to have spent time in Sudan, where Osama bin Laden was based in the early 1990s. After bin Laden was forced to leave Sudan, al-Libi turned up in Britain in 1995 where he was granted political asylum under unclear circumstances and lived in Manchester. He was arrested by Scotland Yard in 1999, but released because of lack of evidence and later fled Britain. After his indictment in December 2000 over the embassy bombings, U.S. officials said they believed he was hiding in Afghanistan. Al-Libi later said in court filings that he returned to Libya as dissent against dictator Moammar Gadhafi grew into an open revolt that led to the leader's downfall and killing in 2011. He said he 'joined with forces of NATO and the United States' to replace Gadhafi, hoping to establish a 'stable Islamic secular state.' In October 2013, the U.S. Army's Delta Force swooped into Tripoli and seized al-Libi after dawn prayers, his brother Nabih al-Ruqai said. Al-Libi said the soldiers took him to the USS San Antonio, where CIA agents interrogating him warned the questioning would be the 'easiest step' of three. 'I took this to mean that the physical and psychological torture would only increase if I failed to cooperate with my questioners,' he said in a court affidavit. 'These threats continued the entire time I was on board the ship.' Al-Libi's lawyer, Bernard Kleinman, argued his client didn't plan the bombing. 'This case involves issues much more tinged with emotion and trauma than other cases,' Kleinman said in 2013. 'The fact that Mr. al-Libi will be tried in New York, barely a half mile from the World Trade Center site, and that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida will be referenced numerous times in connection with his co-defendants cannot be ignored.' Al-Libi isn't the only terror suspect to be snatched by U.S. special forces in Libya. American troops last year grabbed Ahmed Abu Khattala, a suspect in the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. The ability for U.S. troops to move freely in Libya reflects the chaos gripping the country beset by rival militias and political factions in the years since Gadhafi's downfall. Battles openly rage in its east and west as Islamic militant groups have turned coastline cities and border areas into safe havens. Libya's rival governments had no immediate reaction to al-Libi's death.","Abu Anas Al-Liby, 50, died Friday night at a New York hospital .

"Facebook and Twitter have been accused of allowing Islamophobia to flourish by refusing to remove hundreds of inflammatory posts which have been reported by anti-racism campaigners. Some of the posts which have been flagged up to the two social media sites include accusations of Muslims being rapists, paedophiles and  comparable to cancer. In one shocking example, a Facebook user, who was referring to the beheading of Westerners in Syria said: 'For every person beheaded by these sick savages we should drag 10 off the streets and behead them, film it and put it online. Facebook has been accused of allowing Islamophobia to flourish by refusing to take down hundreds of inflammatory posts from their sites. Pictured: CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaking in California in 2013 . 'For every child they cut in half … we cut one of their children in half. An eye for an eye.' But, in several cases, the accounts behind the abusive messages have not been suspended, nor have the posts been removed, according to a report by The Independent. Facebook said it had to 'strike the right balance' between freedom of expression and maintaining 'a safe and trusted environment', while Twitter maintained that all reports against the site's rules were investigated. The investigation also found that the volume of posts have increased significantly in the wake of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal and the beheading of British hostages by ISIS fanatics. Over the past four months, Muslim groups have been compiling details of online abuse and reporting it to Twitter and Facebook. They have reportedly brought hundreds of messages to the attention of the social-media companies, but the accounts are still easily accessible. One prolific tweeter, who has been reported several times, wrote on New Year's Eve: 'Should have lost World War Two. Your daughters would be getting impregnated by handsome blond Germans instead of Pakistani goat herders. Good job Britain.' One man, Eric King, who was branded a 'vile, reprehensible bigot' after he sent offensive photographs and social media posts to an Islamic community centre near Truro, was given a suspended sentence for his crime. Twitter said it investigates all abuse reported against its rules, but anti-racism groups say they have found several tweets which are inflammatory and have not been taken down . But his Facebook account, which he used to send abusive messages to the same mosque and is still using to convey his message, is still active. Fiyaz Mughal, director of Faith Matters, an interfaith organisation which runs a helpline called Tell MAMA, for victims of anti-Muslim violence, said he was disappointed the sites were not taking a stronger stance. He said: 'It is morally unacceptable that social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which are vast profit-making companies, socially engineer what is right and wrong to say in our society when they leave up inflammatory, highly socially divisive and openly bigoted views.' Mr Mughal said that Tell MAMA regularly receives reports of anti-Muslim rhetoric and hate from concerned Facebook and Twitter users. In October, the Metropolitan Police also released figures to show hate crime against Muslims in London had risen by 65 per cent over the previous 12 months. Latest figures also suggest that anti-Muslim hate crime has risen sharply following the murder of Lee Rigby in 2013. In a statement Facebook said it had a clear policy for deciding what was and what was not acceptable freedom of speech. 'We take hate speech seriously and remove any content reported to us that directly attacks others based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability or medical condition. The volume of posts have increased significantly in the past few months, in the aftermath of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal and the murder of British hostages held by ISIS. Pictured: The ISIS flag . 'With a diverse global community of more than a billion people, we occasionally see people post content which, whilst not against our rules, some people may find offensive. 'By working with community groups like Faith Matters, we aim to show people the power of counter speech and, in doing so, strike the right balance between giving people the freedom to express themselves and maintaining a safe and trusted environment.' A Twitter spokesman said: 'We review all reported content against our rules, which prohibit targeted abuse and direct, specific threats of violence against others.'","Posts include accusations of Muslims being rapists and paedophiles .

"The highly-trained police officers were more concerned about the contents of the Man Haron Monis' backpack than his firearm when they stormed the Lindt cafe in the chilling final seconds of the Sydney siege. The six State Protection Group officers were ordered to enter the Martin Place building immediately after cafe manager Tori Johnson was shot in the head by the gunman, reports the Daily Telegraph. The crucial movements of the SPG officers have been praised as 'text book entry' by those within the police force, as the specially-trained squad displayed a calm and composed nature despite their suspicions that Monis was strapped with an explosive. Scroll down for video . Six State Protection Group officers believed the gunman had a bomb strapped to his back as they stormed the Lindt cafe on December 16 . Officers were ordered to enter the Martin Place cafe after Monis (left) shot cafe manager Tori Johnson (right) 'They (the SPG) knew as soon the hostage was shot … that they would be going through that door,' a senior police source told The Daily Telegraph. 'The team who went through the doors still thought there were bombs (inside). They were more worried about the backpack than the gun.' 'They were confronted by a man with what they think is a bomb strapped to him and firing a gun at them as they’re going in.' Once Monis was killed, the next concern for the officers was getting the remainder of the female hostages out of the building as safely as possible. It was only then that the officers had time to think about themselves and fled the cafe as the contents of the backpack attached to the gunman's back were still unknown. The Bomb Squad then entered the building and discovered that despite wires hanging out of Monis' backpack - it did not contain explosives. Instead, he claimed Monis (pictured) was only seeking attention and was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children . Meanwhile, tapes of the man responsible for the Martin Place terror plot delivering religious rants, saying 'Society should behave in an Islamic manner', have been unearthed. In 2009, the self-styled sheik - five years before he carried out the 16-hour attack where he held 18 people hostage in Martin Place's Lindt Cafe in Sydney's CBD last month - imparted his extremist views to a crowd inside a prayer hall in the city's western suburbs. The December siege, which shocked Australia and sparked an outpouring of grief from across the nation, ended with the deaths of cafe manager Tori Johnson and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson - who worked as a barrister at nearby law chambers Eight Selborne. The footage, translated by a Farsi translator for The Daily Telegraph, slammed overseas government who experienced the most violent of crimes, saying: 'your intelligence service is not working properly'. He believed governments who were 'not aware that there [was] criminal activity happening in your country' then officials should resign from their positions as they were 'incompetent'. At times, Monis became so passionate he was seen thumping his fists to drive home his message. Showing his level of paranoia, the terrorist also warned one of the biggest threats against fundamentalist Muslims lay within their community. Monis and two of his hostages, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, were killed in the bloody conclusion to the siege in the early hours of December 16 . Monis believed moderate Muslims would spell the death of extremists. Canvassing what he thought was the virtues of Sharia law, he pushed the case for Australia to take on more of the Islamic culture. 'The core of an Islamic society is justice, social justice. Society should behave in an Islamic manner and there should be justice,' he said. In the same year he fell off the radar of intelligence agencies, Monis warned about keeping an eye on 'friends' who assimilated into the community before delivering terror. 'An enemy would bluntly claim that they are the enemy. An ignorant friend claims that they are friends and they approach you, you would socialise with them and associate with them, but one day like a bear, they lift a big stone and they hit it to the face of that person and kills him,' he said. Monis went on to say people should fear the ones who declared 'Islam is in jeopardy'. Adding to the terrifying picture that has been pieced together of Monis over the past couple of weeks following the siege, friends of the gunman said he was an enigma who set up political party Hezbollah Australia and funded a Campsie warehouse to be turned into a prayer hall. Mamdouh Habib (pictured), who was assisted by Monis in 2007 when he sought Labor's seat in Sydney's western suburb of Auburn, said he knew Man Haron Monis 'very well' and insisted that the Sydney siege gunman was 'not violent' Refugee advocate Jamal Daoud told News Corp he did not know where Monis' money was sourced and the terrorist was 'mysterious'. Mr Daoud added the gunman was good at networking from both sides of the Muslim community - Sunni and Shia, saying 'He knew a lot about everybody, they knew nothing about him'. The advocate said Monis worshiped at different mosques around Sydney, which included Granville's Nabi Akram Islamic Centre, in Sydney's west - a location where these religious rants were given. The way Monis spoke was described as 'slow' and 'low-pitched'. Mr Daoud said the gunman was a 'very good listener' who 'wasn't stupid, he's intelligent'. It comes after former failed politician and Guantánamo Bay detainee, who previously employed gunman Monis, claimed he could have convinced the 50-year-old to end the Sydney siege without resorting to violence. His offer was one of many put forward by other Muslim community members, including the Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed (pictured). All of these are believed to have been rejected . Mamdouh Habib, who was assisted by Monis in 2007 when he sought Labor's seat in Sydney's western suburb of Auburn, told Fairfax he knew him 'very well' and insisted that Monis was 'not violent'. Despite this show of support, Monis will be buried in an undisclosed location in Melbourne after the Sydney Muslim community reportedly refused to bury him. The wrongly accused former Guantánamo Bay detainee, who was tortured after being arrested in Pakistan under the false pretences he had knowledge of the September 11 attacks, claimed Monis was only seeking attention. Mr Habib offered to help negotiate with the gunman during the siege, and maintains that Monis, while 'sick and disturbed' was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children. He insistently told Fairfax he believed Monis had no intention of harming any of the 18 people he took hostage at the Lindt Café in Martin Place on December 15, nor that his attack was associated with motivations linked to terrorist organisation the Islamic State. His offer of help police negotiate with the 50-year-old was one of many put forward by other Muslim community members, including the Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed. All of these are believed to have been rejected. Meanwhile, Monis' body has finally been claimed by some of his anonymous acquaintances, and will be buried somewhere in Melbourne within the next few days, according to the Telegraph. It follows claims from the Muslim community no Muslim funeral home would accept him as his body remained in the morgue unclaimed, days after the siege had ended. An Islamic State propaganda magazine lavished Monis' with praise for the siege, labelling the hostage crisis a 'daring raid' and calling for more lone wolf attacks in Australia .","Police thought gunman had bomb in backpack on his back in cafe siege .

"United Airlines has apologized to a New Jersey mother who said the company 'humiliated' her by not allowing her disabled three-year-old daughter to sit on her lap during a flight -- even though the child is physically unable to sit up on her own. Elit Kirschenbaum said her flight from the Dominican Republic was delayed for nearly an hour in the Dec. 30 incident as a flight attendant insisted her daughter Ivy, a stroke survivor with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy, be placed in a seat on her own. The family, aware of federal safety regulations that children over two years old need their own seat, had bought an economy seat for Ivy but kept her with them in business class due to her condition. Outrage: The Kirschenbaum family were on their way back from a Christmas holiday in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, when a United Airline flight attendant said Ivy, 3, (back right) had to sit in her own seat as she is over 2 . 'Humiliating': Mother-of-four Elit Kirschenbaum said the hour-long ordeal was humiliating for her family . Kirschenbaum wrote in a Tumblr post that three flight attendants walked by her with the three-year-old on her lap and made no comment. However, moments before the New Jersey-bound flight took off, a fourth flight attendant confronted Kirschenbaum about the seating arrangement. Describing the situation in a Facebook post, Kirschenbaum wrote that she thoroughly explained to the flight attendant that her daughter was unable to sit independently but the woman 'insisted on creating a scene.' 'The remaining 3 flight attendants pleaded our case, in fact one was in tears, but this one attendant dug her heels in and wouldn't budge,' Kirschenbaum wrote. 'All of my children were sobbing, my niece was sobbing, other passengers were getting involved yet this woman still displayed zero compassion.' She wrote on Tumblr that her husband pleaded with the flight attended with no success and ultimately approached the pilot asking for help. Ivy: Ivy (right) is a stroke survivor with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy, the most disabling form of spastic cerebral palsy . 'Offending: In a Jan. 1 tweet, Kirschenbaum wrote that the airline apologized to her and her family on behalf of the 'offending flight attendant' 'Behaved Poorly:' Kirschenbaum said the airline stated that the flight attendant 'behaved poorly' in the situation . Eventually, the airline allowed Ivy to lie across her parents' laps, strapped in, during take-off and landing. The rest of the flight was spent sat on their laps. However, Kirschenbaum said she was 'humiliated in front of a full flight of passengers,' and, demanding an apology from the airline, enlisted the support of the public on Twitter with the hashtag #UnitedWithIvy. 'I don't want free flights and I'm not interested in contacting a lawyer as some people have suggested I should,' she said. 'I just want the airline to apologize.' She added on Facebook: 'United needs to be aware and held accountable for how they treat people with disabilities and their families.' Compensation: After the incident, Kirschenbaum said that she did not want compensation from the airline, but an apology . Hashtag: The mother-of-four took to Twitter to enlist public support with the hashtag #UnitedWithIvy . A spokeswoman for United told ABC News: 'The parents, who were ticketed in first class, wanted to hold the child in their lap rather than have the child take the seat they'd purchased for her in economy. 'Federal safety regulations require any child over the age of two to have his or her own seat, and flight attendants are required by law to enforce that safety rule. 'As we did in this case, we will always try to work with customers on seating arrangements in the event of any special needs.' Many spoke out on Twitter about the airline's treatment of little Ivy and her family. In a statement posted one day after the incident, airline officials wrote 'We at United are sorry that the Kirschenbaums encountered difficulties with their seating while traveling with their 3-year-old daughter.' 'Rather Cold:' The incident even caught the attention of CNN's Jake Tapper who wrote on Twitter that the airline's initial statement to the Kirschenbaum family seemed 'rather cold' Intentions: The family reportedly purchased an economy ticket for little Ivy (right) intending to keep the child with them in business class .

"An X-ray has revealed for the first time the full extent of the injury to Bono’s arm in a bicycle accident – and how it has been pieced back together by metal implants. The 54-year-old U2 singer suffered multiple injuries including a fractured eye socket and shoulder blade as well as a severe fracture to his left elbow after the high-speed crash in New York’s Central Park last November. Bono posted the X-ray of his shattered elbow on his blog, saying: ‘The recovery has been more difficult than I thought. As I write this it is not clear that I will ever play guitar again.’ Scroll down for video . Bono posted a photograph of an X-ray, pictured,  of his blog showing the extent of his injuries . But last night one of America’s leading elbow specialists, Dr Robert Klapper, said: ‘Playing the guitar is absolutely the best physical therapy for this type of injury.’ However the doctor – whose patients have included Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman – added: ‘This is certainly one of the most devastating and complex elbow injuries I’ve ever seen.’ Dr Klapper believes the X-ray was taken during surgery as it shows a tie from an operating room sheet in the top right-hand corner. And he compared the operation to ‘piecing together a jigsaw’, saying it would have taken five hours to knit the mangled elbow together using three titanium plates and 18 screws. But he added: ‘I expect Bono to play the guitar and continue to be the great musician we all know and love.’ The U2 singer, centre, said that he may never be able to play the guitar again following his injury .","The U2 singer broke his elbow in a bicycle accident in New York City .

"She was the well-known author whose debut novel was an international best-seller and was sold in more than 25 countries. But when she died last year, Marsha Mehran appeared to be living a solitary life on the west coast of Ireland with her only assets a one euro coin and a five dollar note. And now eight months on, mystery still surrounds exactly what happened to the once successful Iranian-born author. Author Marsha Mehran, who was found dead alone in a rubbish strewn cottage in County Mayo in April last year . Ms Mehran, 36, was reportedly found dead alone in a rubbish strewn cottage in Lecanvey, County Mayo by the property's letting agent after messages to her had gone unanswered. It is believed she had been dead for more than a week but a recent inquest held in Ireland could not establish a cause of death. Ms Mehran was best-known for her debut novel Pomegranate Soup, which was an international best-seller . Ms Mehran, who was born in Tehran moved to Argentina with her family as a child after their plans to move to the U.S. fell through due to the storming of the American embassy in Iran. After a stint living in Argentina, the family finally moved to Brooklyn in New York, however, her visa was revoked when she was 17 for a minor infringement. She then spent time travelling and it was in 1999 when visiting New York, that she met her future husband, Irish-born Christopher Collins. The couple eventually married in Australia soon after before settling down in County Mayo. In 2005, she released her debut novel Pomegranate Soup, which tells the story of three Iranian sisters who try to win over a community in rural Ireland. It became an interntational best-seller and was favourably rated by the critics. She followed it up with her second novel, Rosewater and Soda Bread in 2008 but in the same year, she divorced her husband. And speaking for the first time since her death, Mr Collins, who now runs a bar company in Brooklyn told the Independent: 'We could tell we were right for each other. There was a synergy between us – it was nice to have somebody who was as passionate about you as you were about them. 'Marsha was battling her own demons. I think she lived some of the fantasies that she wrote and withdrew from real life. It was difficult to watch. The people she knew, she pushed away little by little. She could never accept help – it was one of her strengths and one of her greatest problems.' In the months leading up to her death, Ms Mehran had been working on her latest novel, The Margaret Thatcher School of Beauty, which details her life in Argentina as the Falklands War looms.

"The parents of Shane Montgomery, a 21-year-old student who went missing in the early hours of Thanksgiving after leaving a Philadelphia bar, have confirmed that his body has finally been found. Karen and Kevin Montgomery watched as diver's pulled their son's body from the Schuylkill River in Manayunk about 12.15pm on Saturday. The sad scene brought to an end a widespread month-long search for the West Chester University senior, with a $65,000 reward on offer for information concerning his disappearance. 'Today we have done what we have promised,' Karen Montgomery told NBC Philadelphia today. 'We have found and we brought Shane home.' Found: The body of Shane Montgomery, pictured, was recovered from the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia on Saturday, close to where he was last seen on November 27 .

Bittersweet: His heartbroken parents, Karen and Kevin Montgomery,spoke with the media after their son's body was discovered today . Recovered: Different clues lead search crews to Montgomery's body, especially the discovery of a set of keys nearby (left) in the Schuylkill River two weeks ago. Manayunk is a neighborhood of Philadelphia (top right) Two weeks earlier divers found a set of keys belonging to Montgomery in the same section of water after they were tested on his parents' house. Montgomery was last seen leaving a bar in Manayunk in the early hours of Thanksgiving Day, having returned home from college for the holidays, and was caught on surveillance footage heading towards a parking lot. The search predominantly focused on the nearby Manayunk Canal, with police not suspecting foul play. His heartbroken parents were sure something unfortunate had happened to their son. 'My son is somewhere in that river, and I need to find him and I need to bring him home,' Karen Montgomery previously said. Montgomery had been escorted out of Kildare's bar in Manayunk - a neighborhood of Philadelphia  -at 1.50am on November 27 after he stumbled over the DJ's table.

It later emerged that he had a tab for $17 at the bar, indicating that staff had not served him an excessive amount of alcohol. The bar's owner said that he did not seem drunk and, when he accidentally bumped into the table, he was polite about it. One of the bar's employees walked him to the exit and saw him leave. Surveillance footage captured him walking across a footbridge over the Manayunk Canal to a parking lot on the other side. He was not seen returning. The footage has been withheld by authorities. Missing: Montgomery, a student at West Chester University, had a distinct Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder . The FBI has joined the search and K-9s, helicopters and marine units have been used to help find the student - but there has been no sign of him.

"Doctors say 16million Britons may not gain any benefit at all from taking a daily dose of Aspirin . Aspirin is pointless for a quarter of patients and hundreds could be needlessly dying as a result, doctors have warned. They say that 16million Britons may not gain any benefit at all from taking a daily dose of the drug, which is mainly used  to thin the blood. Those at risk of heart attacks and strokes are also thought to be around four times more likely to suffer a fatal attack than those for whom aspirin is effective. Scientists have now developed a  £10 urine test that can tell whether the drug is effective for individual patients. Doctors want patients to be tested for aspirin resistance before they are prescribed the drug. Dr Paul Ames, a consultant at St George's Hospital, London, believes the new test could have a significant impact on the health of hundreds of thousands of patients. He told The Daily Telegraph: 'Doctors need to realise that aspirin, the cornerstone of much cardiac therapy, is not working for up to 25 per cent of those taking it. 'Then there are the side effects, such as ulcers, to consider.' He added that aspirin-resistant patients are twice as likely to suffer a heart attack and almost four times more likely to suffer cardiovascular death. Scroll down for video . He said it was imperative that there should be testing for aspirin resistance, so patients can be given alternative treatments. Doctors have warned that a quarter of users are actually aspirin-resistant and should not take the medicine . Aspirin, known as acetylsalicylic acid, has been used for many years as a painkiller because it is an anti-inflammatory. Low doses of up to 75mg are recommended for people with known cardiovascular disease because it thins the blood. Medics say that, in aspirin-resistant patients, blood thinning is poor. It means there a greater likelihood of clots forming in arteries, resulting in heart attacks and strokes.","16million Britons may not gain any benefit from taking a daily dose of drug .

The two were killed by gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who posted online before that it was a revenge attack for the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, black men killed by police . The murders led to a rift between the NYPD and City Hall, with many officers turning their backs on mayor Bill de Blasio at the funeral of Officer Ramos as a show of frustration. But New York's top cop, Commissioner Bill Bratton, has urged his officers not to stage a repeat performance, saying such a thing would be 'inappropriate'. They were urged instead to live up to the department's traditions of 'honor and decency'. The message, seen by the New York Post, stated: 'A hero's funeral is about grieving, not grievance. 'I issue no mandates and I make no threats of discipline. But I remind you that when you don the uniform of this department, you are bound by the tradition, honor, and decency that go with it. Procession: Hundreds of cops gathered for the event, just miles from where the two officers were killed . Hero: Wenjian Liu, right, was one of two officers gunned down by Ismaaiyl Brinsley as they sat in their patrol car . Guards: Officers keep watch over the funeral home. They have been urged by their commissioner, Bill Bratton, not to show disrespect to city mayor Bill de Blasio, lest they cheapen the occasion . Appeal: Commissioner Bill Bratton, center, has urged officers not to turn their backs do Mayor de Blasio, right . Protest: Thousands of officers turned their backs during De Blasio's eulogy at Rafael Ramos' funeral on December 27 . 'The country’s consciousness of that funeral has focused on an act of disrespect shown by a fraction of those…officers,' he said. 'All officers were painted by it, and it stole the valor, honor, and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of detective Rafael Ramos’s life and service. 'That was not the intent, I know. But it was the result.' Last Saturday, the New York City Police Department buried a hero. Tens of thousands of officers from our department and hundreds of other departments came to show respect for detective first grade Rafael Ramos. His family witnessed the kind of love that only his second family in blue could display. But for the last seven days, the city's and the country's consciousness of that funeral has focused on an act of disrespect shown by a portion of those tens of thousands of officers. It was not all the officers, and it was not disrespect directed at Detective Ramos. But all the officers were painted by it, and it stole the valor, honor, and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of Detective Rafael Ramos's life and sacrifice. That was not that intent, I know. But it was the result. On Sunday, we will gather together again, with the rest of New York City and law-enforcement officials nationwide, to mourn for Detective First Grade Wenjian Liu. We gather to support his parents, his widow, and everyone who is there to remember a life tragically cut short. The assassination of Detectives Liu and Ramos was an attack on us all. As a cop, one who lived and worked through the assassination threats of the 1970s, I understand that emotions are high. I issue no mandates, and I make no threats of discipline. But I remind you that when you don the uniform of this department, you are bound by the tradition, honor, and decency that go with it.","Bratton sent internal mail urging officers to show 'honor and decency'

"Council officers have ticked off the Sandringham estate after its Wild Hare Pâté breached labelling rules . The Queen was at the centre of a trading standards investigation last week after her Sandringham gift shop was found to be selling a range of pâté which breaches food labelling regulations. Norfolk County Council officers confirmed that they were ticking off the Royal estate for not printing its address on labels of jars of the meat delicacy. Failing to include the address of a ‘food business operator’ is a breach of labelling regulations, punishable by a fine of up to £5,000 if an ‘improvement notice’ is ignored. Conservation groups also criticised the inclusion of wild hare pâté in the range, as brown hares are seen as an endangered species in the UK. Also in the range are pheasant with Armagnac, pork, duck, wild boar and venison with Burgundy. Council staff were alerted by a shopper who bought one of the 180g jars, displayed prominently on a table inside the traditional gift shop. Officials also looked into claims that the labels potentially breached rules by not making clear the pâté was made in France, but that was dismissed. There is normally no requirement for a meat product to show a place of origin unless its label gives a misleading impression that it comes from a different country. The shopper said the use of the Sandringham name accompanied by the estate’s logo with a crown on the label suggested it was British. Scroll down for video . The pâté is sold at the Sandringham gift shop and Trading Standards officers were alerted by a member of the public . The Queen, pictured with other Royals after the traditional Christmas Day service at the 20,000 acre-estate, is currently still on holiday there . But trading standards ruled that the labels, which state that the pâté was ‘specially prepared for the Sandringham estate’, did not imply it was made in the UK. A Norfolk County Council spokesman said: ‘We will always look at any concerns raised by the public about food labelling.’ It is not the first time the Queen has been accused of breaking trading standards rules on her 20,000-acre estate, where she is currently spending her Christmas break. In 2001, it emerged that timber was being sold at her Sandringham sawmill in imperial feet and inches, with metric measurements only in small print. Norfolk trading standards officials threatened to bring a prosecution if the mill failed to change to using metres as its more prominent measurement.","Sandringham estate was selling pâté which breached labelling regulations .

"One of Scotland’s biggest landowners has joined Sir Ian Botham in attacking the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds for wasting millions of pounds in donations and failing to protect wildlife. John Mackenzie, who was at Gordonstoun school with Prince Charles, has erected signs across his 50,000-acre Gairloch and Conon estate reading: ‘RSPB not welcome here either.’ In November, The Mail on Sunday published an open letter from Sir Ian to the RSPB, in which the former England cricket captain accused the charity of wasting millions of pounds worth of donations, being misleading in its marketing and proving ineffective at helping birds. Scroll down for video . John Mackenzie has erected signs around his 50,000-acre estate claiming the RSPB are not welcome . Cricketer Ian Botham had earlier criticised the RSPB in November for wasting millions of its donations . Mr Mackenzie told this newspaper: ‘The RSPB has lost the plot and are out of control. They seem more intent on continuing to raise vast sums of money rather than performing their primary role of conservation and promoting the growth of protected species. ‘I admit it is years of frustration and anger boiling over. Landowners, farmers and gamekeepers have always been an easy target, blamed by the society for the poisoning and shooting of raptors. But the RSPB itself is doing damage. ‘They are so big and so powerful now, someone has to try to make them stop and think. If we can make them have a rethink, then at least we will have achieved something.’ Mr Mackenzie revealed that not everyone agrees with his protest; two of his signs have been torn down, while another has been damaged. Undeterred, the 70-year-old, who has been joined by Peter Hingston of the Fairburn Estate, says he has encouraged estates in Evanton, Ardgay, Marybank and the Borders to add their names to his campaign. Mr Hingston, who has erected two of the signs on his 18,000-acre estate in Ross-shire, said: ‘The intention is to raise awareness of the fact there are some people who are unhappy about the way other people are being treated by the RSPB. I feel strongly about it. Mr MacKenzie said the RSPB seem more intent on raising vast sums of money than their conservation role . ‘They seem to be getting out of control and spending an extraordinary amount of money on publicity. They seem to be going the same way as the RSPCA: taking as much trouble to stop hunting and other sporting activities that irritate them. ‘We have red kites and I was unaware that the RSPB come and visit the sites. I’ve got no objection to them coming but find it irritating to discover they have been driving around looking at things themselves.’ He added: ‘As far as I can see they can do what they like. It rather suggests the RSPB don’t trust landowners to look after their land properly when we do so much for them. ‘I don’t like it when people seem determined to try to catch us out rather than discuss any problems they have with us.’ A spokesman for the RSPB said: ‘While we would prefer a constructive dialogue with anyone who disagrees with our charitable work, it is of course the right of any individual to erect a sign on their private land expressing their opinion.’","John Mackenzie has erected signs warning the RSPB they are not welcome .

"The London meeting: Virginia Roberts with the Prince in the capital in 2001 . Prince Andrew tonight issued a dramatic and unprecedented denial that he slept with the woman at the centre of the extraordinary under-age ‘sex slave’ scandal. For the first time, Buckingham Palace made a robust rebuttal of the allegations by Virginia Roberts that she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York in London, New York and the Caribbean, starting when she was only 17. In a shock move tonight, the Prince came out fighting against the woman whose allegations have dogged him for more than three years. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said in a statement to The Mail on Sunday: ‘It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. ‘Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.’ According to Royal sources, the dramatic statement marks the beginning of a determined attempt to demolish the bombshell allegations made by Miss Roberts, who served as a masseuse to the Prince’s billionaire paedophile friend Jeffrey Epstein for four years. Insiders insist there is not a shred of truth in her attempt to drag the Prince into the sordid affair by naming him in US court papers uncovered on Friday, and so they had little option but to deny it publicly as his reputation is at stake. ‘There is nothing that the Duke cares more about than his reputation, which is why he decided to make this unprecedented denial of any impropriety,’ said a friend. Prince Andrew resigned as the Government’s global trade envoy and apologised for his former friendship with Mr Epstein when the scandal first broke three years ago, and a picture emerged of the Prince with his arm around the teenage Miss Roberts. Since then, he has devoted his time to business and charity initiatives including encouraging entrepreneurs and apprenticeships. The strongly worded denial goes much further than the limited statement issued by the palace on Friday – which did not refer to Miss Roberts’ name or mention sex or a relationship – and is the most personal statement issued in recent years on behalf of senior Royal. It came after top Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, who was also accused by Miss Roberts of having sex with her, made a forceful attack on the claims. He said: ‘This person has made this up out of cloth, maliciously and knowingly in order to extort money from Mr Epstein.’ The lawyer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday that he would not rest until he had shown that the claims regarding his conduct were false and he advised the Duke to do everything in his power to clear his name. Scroll down for video . Attack: Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, left, who was also accused by Miss Roberts of having sex with her, made a forceful attack on the claims. Right, Prince Andrew with former friend Epstein in 2011 . ‘My only feeling is, if she’s lied about me, which I know to an absolute certainty she has, she should not be believed about anyone else,’ he said. ‘We know she’s lied about other public figures, including a former prime minister and others who she claims to have participated in sexual activities with, so I think it must be presumed all her allegations against Prince Andrew were false as well. 'You cannot allow these allegations to hang above you. You have to fight back with every resource and ounce of energy available to you.’ On a day of high drama, the Palace issue TWO bombshell statements to the Mail on Sunday . Due to doubts over whether Prince Andrew was denying Virginia Roberts’s account in its totality, The Mail on Sunday asked the Palace to confirm or deny that the Prince had had any sexual contact with Virginia Roberts. Their first answer left some ambiguity, then came the dramatic second statement proclaiming his innocence. Palace statement at 5.04pm... A very serious allegation, of sex with a minor, was levelled at the Duke in a legal document submitted to a US court. The earlier statement categorically rejected that claim; and as was indicated at the time, we do not intend to comment further. ... and at 7.40pm . It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.

"As 90-year-old Louise Bain took her last breath, Robert, her devoted husband of 72 years, grasped his chest. Six hours after his beloved wife, he also passed away. The pair from Louisiana, who died the knot in 1942, both died on December 26 following what their family described as an inseparable relationship. They moved into assisted living in Alpharetta, Georgia, in 2011 for the final years of their life and would constantly walk around holding hands, according to staff. Inseparable: Robert, 92, and Louise Bain, 90, died within hours of each other following a 72-year marriage . They are survived by one son, two daughters, six grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. One of their daughters Charlotte Tallent of McCormick, South Carolina, told the Atlanta Constitution Journal: 'The moment Mom passed, daddy grasped his chest. He knew she was gone.' They key to their marriage, she added, was that 'Mom stayed true to who she was and never wavered from that. They knew who they were and enjoyed who they were.' They met at a Texas church camp in 1940. Robert had taken another girl but ended up going home with Louise. Robert worked for the International Paper Company in Bastrop, Louisiana, before enlisting in the Army Air Corps during the Second World War. Louise worked on the Mississippi base with him as a civilian driving an Army truck. In 1954 they moved to Rome, Goergia where Robert worked for Georgia Kraft Company, for 31 years, until his retirement in 1985. Their family described how they would do everything together, including fishing and hunting. Grandson Bob Williams said they were a 'perfect match'. Louise's relatives often described how she would say Robert was the 'best-looking man' and she 'stole his heart'. Family friend Ann Spell, who named their daughter after Louise, told the paper: 'They put the other person’s needs in front of their own; they were inspirational. 'He was always a gentleman, he let her go first.'

"They are more commonly seen being transported on ships and at ports around the world. But with the addition of flatscreen TVs, en-suite bathrooms and air conditioning, these shipping containers are now being billed as a solution to London’s housing crisis. The containers come from China and are transformed into studio apartments in Britain which can be stacked on top of each other - and are available to rent for only £75 a week. The scheme looks set to take off after the council granted planning permission to the Forest Young Man's Christian Association (YMCA) to establish two sites in Waltham Forest, north-east London.

From the outside: The YMCA have unveiled a revolutionary housing scheme at their branch at Waltham Forest in north-east London using converted shipping containers to house young people on low incomes . Comfortable: Former YMCA resident Louise Stephenson watches TV in one of the homes in north-east London . Solution: It is hoped these shipping containers from China - which are transformed into studios in Britain and can be stacked on top of each other - could help solve London's housing crisis . The 'mYPads' - which cost £20,000 each - are designed to allow young people to have their own rental accommodation but at a price that allows them to save up for a deposit. It is thought each of the homes could save taxpayers £25,000 each year by taking people off housing and other related benefits. Louise Stephenson, 30, is a former Forest YMCA resident who hopes to be one of the first people to take advantage of the scheme once the sites are completed.

Modern: The homes were developed for Forest YMCA residents, but bosses are prepared to sell or lease mYPads to individuals or organisations committed to providing non-benefit based accommodation . Low-cost: They contain a flatscreen TV, en-suite bathroom, air conditioning and cost £75 per week to rent . How they once appeared: A cargo ship packed with containers at Harwich port in Essex (file picture) ‘mYPads offer an affordable solution to this problem, and they enable our residents to save for a deposit and the other financial requirements of living independently.’ This is not the first time that shipping containers have been adapted into homes. MailOnline reported last November how a housing trust in Brighton wanted to use 36 adapted containers as a stop-gap for people without a permanent home. The containers were transformed into self-contained studio flats, and feature bathrooms, kitchens and plasterboarded walls. The structures were designed for a social housing project in Amsterdam in 2010, but the scheme was abandoned after funding issues. High property prices, steep private rents and low average wages in the seaside town have contributed to high levels of homelessness. The homes were developed for Forest YMCA . residents, but bosses are prepared to sell or lease mYPads to . individuals, housing organisations, churches and local authorities . committed to providing non-benefit based accommodation. Forest YMCA chief executive Timothy Pain said: ‘We’ve been overwhelmed by the support the mYPad project has received since its inception. ‘Equally, we’ve encountered so many obstacles and objections, but all of our hard work and persistence has paid off. ‘This isn’t just great news for us at Forest YMCA, but for the sector as a whole, as the mYPad project will now have its opportunity to prove itself as a credible solution to the affordable housing crisis that is affecting so many young people.' Last month it was claimed by the body which represents London's councils that more than 800,000 new homes must be built in the capital by 2021 to keep up with housing demand.","Homes contain flatscreen TV, en-suite bathroom and air conditioning .

Sizzling Downton Abbey star Lily James was involved in a blazing drama of a different kind during the filming of Disney’s live-action Cinderella extravaganza when a sumptuous wedding gown she was wearing caught fire. The 24-year-old had been shooting a scene at Pinewood studios. The bridal dress — with its voluminous skirts, three miles of hemming and covered in Swarovski crystals — is a work of art in its own right. It covers so much square footage the actress can’t always see what’s in front of her. She was led into her dressing room (a large tent in a corner of the vast 007 sound stage) and her hem brushed against a heater and began smouldering. ‘It had turned really cold and someone had put a three-bar heater a bit too close to where Lily was going to sit on a stool,’ explained distinguished costume designer Sandy Powell. ‘Luckily, just a segment of the silk dress got burnt. Thank God Lily wasn’t harmed,’ added Powell  who has collected three Oscars and two Baftas for her screen creations. ‘I wore this wedding dress for about 20 seconds before I walked past the heater and burned some of it,’ Lily told me as she was preparing to film sequences on another occasion with Richard Madden as her dashing Prince Charming. She said she was in tears at first — until Ben Chaplin, who plays Cinderella’s father, lightened the mood by saying: ‘Well, I’ll wait a while before I make the Cinders joke.’ Lily said: ‘I went: “Oh, no!” And I was laughing through my tears. ‘I was fine. I wasn’t hurt, just a bit shocked for a little while.’ There are several copies of the wedding gown in varying weights for different circumstances, such as coming down a marble staircase, for dancing and walking. The one that was burned had a number of heavy skirts. ‘It’s sort of torture, wearing this dress,’ Lily explained because of having to wear a corset that cinches her down to a 21in waist. ‘I have no waist,’  she said laughing. ‘It’s really hard to eat. I have soup, and if I follow with two squares of chocolate, I’m stuffed. It’s so depressing,’ she added, collapsing into giggles. ‘And because everything’s so tight, I  burp. You just have to burp when you need to.’ But, . incendiary dresses aside, Lily said she’s been having ‘a ball’ working . with director Kenneth Branagh and a bevy of leading ladies, including . Cate Blanchett as her wicked-ish step-mother, Helena Bonham Carter as . her fairy godmother and Holliday Grainger and Sophie McShera as . Cinderella’s step-sisters. Her male co-stars include Stellan Skarsgard, Nonso Anozie and Derek Jacobi. David . Barron and Allison Shearmur, who are producing the film for the Disney . corporation, said the picture won’t be released until Easter 2015. Meanwhile, . Lily is taking a well-earned festive break before rejoining her Downton . Abbey ‘family’ in February to film the fifth series, in which she plays . the vivacious Lady Rose.

Amy Adams believes she and Jennifer Lawrence have — how can one say this — more ‘male attributes’ than the men in the great new movie American Hustle. The two stars play adversaries in David O. Russell’s fictionalised picture based loosely on a real-life Seventies scandal involving con men, the FBI, a fake sheik, a Mafia don and some really cool dirty dancing. Amy, who starred in the recent Superman (and will soon shoot its Batman vs Superman sequel) and Doubt and Russell’s award-winning The Fighter, plays a trickster who hooks up with a fellow fraudster, played by Christian Bale (they bond over Duke Ellington), who happens to be married to a fiery Jennifer Lawrence.

When Amy and Jennifer’s characters meet, sparks fly, and they seal their loathing with a whopper of a kiss. Amy lauds Russell for finding two plum parts for women. ‘He applies what could be considered male attributes to his female characters, and they sometimes have the biggest b***s in his films,’ she told me from Los Angeles. Amy’s character, Sydney, has the smartest moves, too, when she meets Bradley Cooper’s dandy FBI agent. In her low-cut Seventies frock, she and Cooper, both professionally trained, perform a fabulous dance scene that very much evokes the era. When Amy and Jennifer¿s characters meet, sparks fly, and they seal their loathing with a whopper of a kiss . Amy said she’d love to go out dancing with Cooper off-screen, ‘but tongues would wag’. Sydney wouldn’t ever worry about such things. ‘Sydney has great strength, but I think she’s lost morally,’ Amy attests. On occasion, she took Sydney home. ‘I certainly wore low-cut shirts all around the house,’ she teased. American Hustle, which opens today, is one of the year’s most delicious movies. It has multiple Golden Globe nominations and is expected to do well when Bafta and Oscar lists are announced early in January. Rachael Stirling will lead a rare production of Terence Rattigan¿s 1958 play Variation On A Theme . Rachael Stirling, who will lead a rare production of Terence Rattigan’s 1958 play Variation On A Theme, which hasn’t been seen in London for more than 50 years. It’s about a high-society hostess, a ballet dancer and a choreographer who become embroiled in a spiteful love triangle. The play arrived at the same time  as the theatre of the Angry Young  Man — led by John Osborne, Arnold Wesker and Harold Pinter — was hitting the Royal Court and elsewhere, and critics found Rattigan’s work rather tame by comparison. But several recent Rattigan revivals have proved that his work remains powerfully potent. Rachael (pictured below left) — the daughter of actress Diana Rigg — took part in a staged reading of Variation On A Theme during the Rattigan centenary at the Chichester Festival Theatre two years ago. Now the HPZ production company  is bringing the play — with Rachael as the socialite Rose — to the Finborough Theatre in London’s Earls Court from February 25. ‘It didn’t receive a favourable reception initially,’ said Sam Zdzieblo, a member of the production team. ‘But it’s a bit of a lost treasure.’ The original production, starring Margaret Leighton and Jeremy Brett, was directed by Sir John Gielgud.

"Dramatic CCTV footage has emerged from Anhui Province, China of a rickshaw scraping unharmed through the middle of a crash at a crossroad in December. According to local reports the accident happened when a speeding truck ran a red light and crashed into a car from the other direction. As the two smashed and spun out of control the rickshaw can be seen passing through the dusty centre middle of the accident in a narrow escape. Police reportedly say the two drivers cheated death but were hospitalised after the incident that happened just days before Christmas. The rickshaw comes only a matter of inches from colliding with the car, and then continues on its journey. A scene at the end of the video shows the substantial damage caused to both vehicles - the side of the car is badly smashed in, while the front of the truck is in a similar state. The people carrier is only inches away from crashing into the unlucky car driver . With the two vehicles circling out of control, the rickshaw calmly pedals through the disaster scene . The truck was said to have sped through a red light causing the horror crash . There was no way the car could get out of the way, and thankfully there were no fatalities . The only good thing to come from the incident is the fact that there were no fatalities. Only days later a truck swerved left then right on a bridge in a scene like a pinball machine after suffering a flat tyre.

"She has turned down the chance to pose for Picasso, holds more titles than The Queen, and may have even inspired the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress. But despite her high profile in her native Spain, little is known about the Duchess of Alba on these shores, with the focus more often falling on her wild hair, flamboyant fashion sense and toyboy husband. Now the 87-year-old billionaire has shed a little more light on her event-filled life with the publication of her second autobiography - just two years after her first. Entitled life: The Duchess of Alba, pictured on her wedding day in 1947, left, and in 2011, right, has opened up about her unique life in a new autobiography . First marriage: The Duchess Of Alba on her wedding day with her father Don Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart y Falcó, the 17th Duke of Alba, and mother María del Rosario Falcó . In What Life Has Taught Me is the . follow up to Yo Cayetana, and the Duchess writes that despite her wealth . all she wants is her health, and that she is eager to 'keep on living'. The Duchess, or . María del Rosario Cayetana Alfonsa Victoria Eugenia Francisca . Fitz-James Stuart y de Silva, to give her the full name, is Spain's . richest woman, has more recognised titles than any other noble in the . world and is a distant relative of both Winston Churchill and Princess . Diana. As the head . of the House of Alba, and the 18th Duchess, her property portfolio . includes castles, palaces, country houses and land across Spain - with . the most famous being the Liria Palace in Madrid, where she was born. As . well as the eccentric Duchess, the palace is also thought to be home to . 249 oil paintings by artists including Rembrandt, Goya, Van Dyck and . Rubens, as well as the Alba Bible which dates back to 1430. Wedding number one: The Duchess of Alba is pictured with her new husband on their wedding day in October 1947 .

The Duchess is a descendant of King James II of England, through his . illegitimate son James Fitz-James, Duke of Berwick whose mother was . Arabella Churchill, the sister of the  Duke of Marlborough. She is therefore distantly related to Sir Winston Churchill and Diana, . Princess of Wales, who were descendants of Arabella‘s daughter Henrietta . Fitz-James. Her godmother was Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain and although her . supreme title is Duchess of Alba, she has more than 44 other noble titles, and 150 hereditary ones. She is a duchess seven times over, a countess 19 times and a marquesa 23 times. Despite her privileged past, in her latest tome the Duchess said that her life 'had not been easy'.

She has lived through both World War . II, and the Spanish Civil War, which broke out 1936, when she was just . 10-years-old to 1939. However, the Duchess has said that her 'most difficult task' was the reconstruction of the family palace in Madrid after it was almost completely razed to the ground during the Civil War. Today . the Duchess is often written about for her appearance, and her apparent . surgical enhancements, although she has never commented on this. In her youth however the Duchess was a . striking beauty, and was even asked by the world-famous painter Pablo . Picasso to become his muse - although she flatly refused this request. 'I think he would have worn me out,' she said in 2009, according to Spain's English language news website The Local. 'I never actually met Picasso.

The Duchess has been known for her colourful love life, which has taken in three marriages, including her latest to civil servant Alfonso Díez, 24 years her junior, who she wed in October 2011 when she was 85. The marriage was partly made possible after a valve was inserted into . the Duchess's brain to stop the cognitive decline she had begun to . suffer. The Duchess's first marriage, to naval officer Don Pedro Luis Martinez de Irujo y Artacoz, son of the Duke of Sotomayor, was a far more lavish affair and even said to have overshadowed interest in the wedding of Queen Elizabeth II to Prince Philip, which took place a month later.

Duchess of Cambridge in 2011. In 1978 the Duchess caused a scandal in Spain by . marrying an illegitimate defrocked Jesuit priest, her former confessor, Jesús Aguirre y Ortiz de Zárate, who died in 2001.

"Former minister Sir Alan Duncan has called for the five-year fixed parliaments law to be repealed . David Cameron is under growing pressure to agree to tear up the Government's controversial fixed term parliaments act which means general elections take place only once every five years. Former minister Sir Alan Duncan today calls for a cross-party deal to repeal the legislation, branding it a ‘recipe for political horse-trading and coalition manoeuvrings’. He is the most senior MP to demand that the law – which will make it all but impossible for either Mr Cameron or Labour leader Ed Miliband to run a minority government if they fail to win a Commons majority next year – is scrapped. Writing for the Daily Mail, he warns it could also lead to repeated changes of government between 2015 and 2020 without voters having any say. ‘All parties should now combine to repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, making the change effective from the day after next May’s election,’ Sir Alan, an international development minister until this summer’s reshuffle, insists. Critics say few appreciated the long-term impact of the constitutional change, which was introduced to ensure one of the coalition parties could not walk out on the other and prompt an election. It means prime ministers no longer have the power to go to the Queen to ask her to call an election when opinion polls are favourable. Instead, they need to win the support of a 'supermajority' of two-thirds of MPs for an election to be held at any time outside of a five-year fixed period - meaning the leader of a minority administration would never be able to go to the polls without the backing of his or her opponents. The only other way to trigger an election as the law stands is if a government loses a vote on a formal motion of no confidence. But other parties then have a two-week period during which they have the opportunity to stitch together a pact to govern before an election is held. A new coalition could therefore take power without any election taking place. Critics say the legislation, cooked up to keep the current coalition together, has ended up being a recipe for never-ending power-sharing government. The Act has also been widely criticised for creating a 'zombie parliament' with little left to do before May's general election. Sir Alan warns the sense that current coalition ‘was negotiated behind closed doors will be nothing compared to the public anger if coalitions are formed, broken and re-formed within the five year term of a Parliament without any new election taking place to give them legitimacy’. Scroll down for video . The fixed-term parliament law was pushed through by the Coalition after they came into power in 2010 . Lord Norton of Louth, Britain’s greatest living expert on Parliament, said of the Act: ‘What is notable is the extent to which its provisions were not that well appreciated at the time and still are not fully understood. ‘Even one academic article on the subject believed that the Queen retained some discretionary powers in respect of dissolution. ‘Prime Ministerial discretion is not involved. The prerogative power in respect of calling an election is gone. The Queen retains no discretionary powers. ‘Under the Act, the provisions are to be reviewed in 2020. However, given the criticisms now being directed at the measure, pressure for some change may become such as to prompt some change.’ Veteran Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh agreed his party should commit to scrapping the legislation. 'We've never had fixed term parliaments in the past and it creates terrible inflexibility. 'It was created artificially just for the sake of the current coalition, supposedly to stop one party walking off, rather than any good constitutional innovation. Five-year parliaments are too long. We should repeal it.' The growing realisation at Westminster that Mr Cameron and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg have overseen constitutional changes that ensure future coalitions are far more likely will anger some MPs who had not appreciated their long-term implications. Some senior Tories, including at least two Cabinet ministers, believe Mr Cameron should have run a minority government after failing to win an outright majority in May 2010 and gone back to the country in a second election in October of that year. One Conservative MP sceptical about the coalition said: 'The coalition was a mistake in the first place, and now Cameron and Clegg are going to leave behind a law tying the hands of future party leaders.' Sir Alan Duncan warns that while the agreement to stay the course has served the country well, a permanent constitutional change will not . A short term fix can do long term damage. So it is with the decision to introduce fixed-term five year parliamentary sessions. It might be good for now: but it’s bad for the future. Until recently General Elections were governed by the Parliament Act 1911, which allowed for a maximum Parliamentary term of five years. Crucially, though, it afforded the sitting Prime Minister the authority to call an election at any time. The Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011 changed this to a rigid five year term, with no easy mechanism for shortening it. Consequently, everyone has known for years that the date of the next election will be 7th May 2015. The Prime Minister’s power to dissolve Parliament under the historic Royal Prerogative has lapsed. The new fixed term of five years can only be curtailed if two thirds of MPs vote for dissolution, or if the House of Commons passes a vote of no confidence in one Government, but fails to pass a vote of confidence in an alternative one within a fortnight. We can all see why this was agreed. The only way a viable government could be formed after the 2010 election was for Conservatives and Liberal Democrats to join as one to create a parliamentary majority. The Liberal Democrats needed to guard against being wrong-footed by a Conservative Prime Minister exercising his historic right to pick the election date and choosing to do so at the worst time for the Liberal Democrats. A deal to agree how long the Government should last was an essential part of the glue which bound the Coalition together. The agreement to stay the course has served the country well, but a permanent constitutional change will not. A fixed term in office and pre-determined election dates might suit a Presidency. They do not in normal circumstances suit a Parliament. Unlike a Presidency, where that top person remains one and the same, Parliament is an organic institution: its characteristics and composition can change in the course of one year, let alone five. Some MPs will die or resign, others may cross the floor. In the course of our history parties have split or merged. Between elections the nature of Parliament, which underpins the energies and legitimacy of a government, can change dramatically. The pressures and changes in the Commons can be at their most acute when there is a tiny majority for the government of the day or, worse, no straightforward majority at all. There have been many such occasions in our history, when it has been best for the country to have a General Election at moments which would have been impossible if we had fixed-term Parliaments. After the February 1974 election Ted Heath tried unsuccessfully to hang on as Prime Minister, before accepting the arithmetic was against him. The Wilson government that took over felt obliged to return to the polls just a few months later, achieving a wafer thin majority. Jim Callaghan’s government fell once the Scottish and Welsh nationalists deserted the Labour Government after the devolution referendums of 1979. John Major governed with a very slim majority between 1992 and 1997 with by-election defeats making the Government live on an ever sharper knife edge. The point is that all these Prime Ministers had the option, when the make-up of Parliament changed, to pull the plug and seek a stronger mandate from the voters. Even when they chose not to, the House of Commons had the power to force their hand with a simple Vote of No Confidence, as in 1979. (Clockwise from top left) Former Prime Ministers Ted Heath, Harold Wilson, Jim Callaghan and John Major had the option to call an election and seek a stronger mandate from voters . The Fixed Term Parliaments Act, however, erects new hurdles that make it harder to dissolve Parliament mid-way through its term. As a result, it is a recipe for political horse-trading and coalition manoeuvrings. This will weaken, not strengthen, public confidence in our politics. The sense that the current Coalition was negotiated behind closed doors will be nothing compared to the public anger if coalitions are formed, broken and re-formed within the five year term of a Parliament without any new election taking place to give them legitimacy. For if the Government were to lose a vote of no confidence, the Prime Minister could no longer call an election and dissolve Parliament. Now, the Opposition would have the chance to cobble together its own majority by wooing potential partners. All this would happen hidden from view in the corridors of Westminster, with the ballot box nowhere in sight. In this scenario the leader of a smaller party, acting as kingmaker, could simply walk away from their coalition partner and prop up the Opposition, without the trouble of asking any voter for their opinion. These are the unintended permanent consequences of an Act designed to fix a temporary problem. It is in every party’s interests and every voter’s interests to have strong, accountable government. To do so, all parties should now combine to repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, making the change effective from the day after next May’s election. If we don’t do this we will all regret having to live with a law suitable for holding together one term of Parliament, but wholly inappropriate for all of those which follow.","Sir Alan Duncan calls for five-year fixed term parliament law to be scrapped .

"A mother in northeastern Oklahoma shot and killed her two grown sons while they slept, then killed herself, law enforcement officials said on Sunday. Rebecca Smith, 48, also known as Rebecca Brown, fatally shot her sons Levi Brown, 25, and father-of-two Garrett Brown, 24, on Saturday morning while they slept in a Webbers Falls home they shared with her, according to the Muskogee County Sheriff's Department. The woman left a suicide note, called her brother to tell him she was going to take her own life and then killed herself, the sheriff's department said. Smith’s brother called 911 after the call and deputies responded, finding all three bodies. Shooter: Rebecca Smith, 48, also known as Rebecca Brown, fatally shot her sons as they slept at their home in Webbers Fall, 30 miles south of Muskogee, Oklahoma. She then turned the gun on herself . Victims: Levi Brown, 25, and father-of-two Garrett Brown, 24, were killed in the murder-suicide. Police have said Smith phoned her brother to say she was going to kill herself and left a suicide note . The Tulsa World reported that law enforcement is investigating what may have led to the killings and said Smith was taking medication. It was also suggested that she may have had mental-health issues. Detectives aren’t aware of anyone else living inside the home, Mullen said, and no one else was thought to have been present during the shootings. The father of the slain men, Leroy Brown of Coweta, and his wife, Pam, waited in the driveway outside of the property waiting for updates in the case. He told the Muskogee Phoenix: 'It’s not the call you want to get at 10 o’clock in the morning. They were a couple of good boys.' Levi Brown, who attended school in Porter, had been in the Army. He returned to Oklahoma after his time in the military was up. On Christmas Eve Brown, who called herself Beckie on Facebook wrote: 'I just wanted to tell all of you my wonderful amazing family members here on facebook how much I appreciate how very kind you all are always to me. I have been through hell for the last month and you have all been so very kind to me! God will reward you, I just know it.'

"Here's the dream for those college years: a  beer pong partner that never gets drunk. Researchers in Massachusetts have developed a robotic arm that can shoot balls across a beer pong table — and score nearly every time. Want to challenge the Versaball? The invention, built by Boston startup Empire Robotics, will make its debut appearance at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this January. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The Versaball, developed by Boston startup Empire Robotics, picks up a ping-pong ball as it prepares to launch . Aim, fire: The robotic arm, which has near-perfect accuracy, gets ready to launch (left) and scores (right) 'The robot is not perfect, so it's possible for a human to win, but it's pretty good, so you'd have to be pretty good at beer pong,' project manager John Dean told Yahoo News. To make the shots, scientists calibrate the arm by aiming at the cup in the center-back row. Researchers then shoot about 10 times to make sure the robot got it — and from there, the computer takes over and calculates the location for the rest of the cups . Engineers hope the Versaball could be outfitted to to grab and relocate items in manufacturing . 'If you watch the video, you will see that the robot does not shoot from the same position each time,' Dean told Yahoo News. 'It moves according to which cup it's aiming at.' Despite its fun use, the Versaball has serious applications. Experts at Empire Robotics hope the technology will be applied to manufacturing and packaging tasks, where a similar arm can grab and drop pills, bricks, light bulbs and other materials. 'What we use it for is generally industrial automation,' Dean told Yahoo News. 'You'd see it in automotive factories, consumer electronics factories, and small mom-and-pop shops that are making little gizmos and gadgets.' Although this technology — which uses components called 'granular materials' — has been around since the 1970s, it has only recently been used in a practical way, according to Yahoo News. Engineer John Amend, who co-founded Empire Robotics, first created a robot that throws darts and ping-pong balls while working on his PhD at Cornell University.

"Oklahoma residents fear that hooded sweatshirts may soon be illegal to wear in public. There is currently a law banning wearing hoods while committing crimes that's been around since the 1920s but an amendment proposed by Senator Don Barrington may make wearing them illegal in public altogether. Oklahomans who wear a hood in public may be forced to fork over a $500 fine. Law banning hoodies: There is currently a law banning wearing hoods while committing crimes  but an amendment proposed by Senator Don Barrington may make wearing them illegal in public altogether . KFOR reports that a law banning hoods was originally written to help fight Klux-Klux-Klan associated crimes. Barrington states he believes wearing a hoods aids in all types of crimes and seeks to pass the amendment to protect the community. 'The intent of Senate Bill 13 is to make businesses and public places safer by ensuring that people cannot conceal their identities for the purpose of crime or harassment…. Similar language has been in Oklahoma statutes for decades and numerous other states have similar laws in place. Oklahoma businesses want state leaders to be responsive to their safety concerns, and this is one way we can provide protection.' – said Sen. Don Barrington of Lawton. Despite Barrington's good intentions, some residents feel as though their rights are being stripped away from them one clothing item at a time. They argue that hoodies are functional and fashionable items of clothing used to keep people warm and dry in nasty weather. Law since the 1920s: A law banning wearing hoods has been around since the 1920's to prevent Klux-Klux-Klan related crimes .

'I think this is a violation of an individual’s right to chose what they want to wear as long as it doesn’t violate the realm of public decency and moral values, and I think this could be very problematic,' Siderias added. KFOR spoke with resident Tracy Wehagen who said someone may want to wear a hoodie for a deeply personal reason and that they should be able to sport the protective gear. 'They might have personal issues for keeping them on; they might have a bad hair day or maybe they have cancer or they’re losing their hair. You just don’t know why,' Tracy Wehagen said. Even though the provision would allow hoods to be worn for religious purposes, parades, costume parties, and even in cold weather, people fear it may be difficult to prove what purpose they are wearing it for.","There is currently a law banning wearing hoods while committing crimes that's been around since the 1920s due to the Klux-Klux-Klan .
An amendment proposed by Senator Don Barrington may make wearing them illegal in public altogether .
Residents fear that the amendment takes the law  a step too far and infringes on their personal freedoms ."
"The Notebook is well-known as one of the most romantic films of all time. So it’s about time that a wannabe groom decided to pop the question using inspiration from the famous movie. Italian Angelo  – with a little help from a proposal planner – hired a private lake in Alexandra Palace, north London, and filled it with 1000 origami swans to propose to his girlfriend, Chiara. A little help from his friends: Angleo asked his friends and family to help out with the proposal and they stood alongside the lake . Inspired: Angelo's proposal was inspired by the famous scene in the Notebook where Noah (Ryan Gosling) rows Allie (Rachel McAdams) out onto the lake outside of his house . The gesture was a reference to the famous scene in the Hollywood movie where Noah, played by Ryan Gosling, took his love Allie, played by Rachel McAdams, on a boat ride to a beautiful lake that was filled with swans. The whole moment was captured on camera by Tiffany Wright - the woman who helped Angelo plan his proposal. Tiffany was also on hand to row into the lake and help release the origami swans into the water. Although the effect wasn't quite as spectacular as the blockbuster movie, from the look on Chiara's face she certainly appreciated the gesture. Angelo then asked his friends and family to hold up signs which contained the worlds, 'Chiara, Will You Marry Me? You are the one.' During the video, Chiara is also seen being serenaded by a singer - the woman sings the Italian's favourite songs as she walks alongside them on the banks of the lake. Happy couple: Angelo (middle) and Chiara (right)  pose with The One Romance's Tiffany Wright (left), a proposal planner . Lovely singing: Angelo hired a singer to play Chiara's favourite songs as they rowed around the lake . Tiffany - who now runs romance company The One Romance but previously set up the UK's first proposal planning company - then delivers the couple some pink cocktails. She told FEMAIL that planning the proposal with Angelo, who now lives in West London with  Chiara, was challenging given that she only had a week's notice. 'I helped Angelo plan his proposal to Chiara after he got in touch with just one week’s notice,' she said. ‘He had no idea how he wanted to propose so I had a long phone conversation with him and discovered that she loved the movie ""The Notebook.’ The special moment: Angelo had the ring with him in the boat the whole time waiting to propose to Chiara . Surprise: At they rowed around the lake Chiara began to notice the paper swans floating around in the water . Tiffany continued: 'With just seven days to plan, we were really up against it time wise. 'Plus, the proposal involved securing a private boating lake in London which is not an easy task! ‘We got a singer to sing her favourite songs and made 1000 origami swans out of paper that we floated onto the lake as they rowed around. 'Angelo also wanted his family and friends included, so we had to keep them hidden in the bushes until the right moment!’ The special moment was filmed for the TV show The Proposers, which aired on Lifetime. And luckily all of Angelo's planning was not in vain. During the proposal, he tells Chiara: 'When we are together, everything is possible. Together everything is doable. 'I did this because when I met you, one year ago more or less, my life changed.' He then presented her with a diamond ring and she accepted his proposal. The video was made for the TV series last year and Angelo and Chiara are now happily married.","Italian Angelo Piccini wanted to ask girlfriend Chiara Grimaldi to marry him .

"Two young children were taken from their 'jihadi' mother as they returned from the Middle East amid concern they were being brainwashed into Islamic extremism. The youngsters were taken into police protection at Luton airport last week after travelling to the UK from Istanbul with their 25-year-old mother. It is understood to be the first case in which authorities have seized children from their parents over fears they were being radicalised. Two children have been the first to be seized from their mother as she was arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences at Luton airport last week. Above, the young son of jihadi Khadijah Dare poses with an AK-47 rifle . Meanwhile nurseries are being urged to screen toddlers who display fanatical views. Home Office guidance has been issued to teachers to who are expected 'to have the training they need to identify children at risk of radicalisation'. On New Year's Eve, two children, believed to be under 10, were taken from their mother as she was arrested at Luton airport on suspicion of terrorism offences. The Haringey-based family, who are understood to have links to Birmingham, had travelled from Istanbul with the Turkish airline Atlasjet, which also operates a flight to Gaziantep - nicknamed ISIS International for its proximity to the Syrian border. At first, West Midlands Police said they had been taken into the care of social services. Later, officers said the youngsters were subject to a police protection order. The force would not confirm whether they had been returned to their mother, but revealed they were not in the care of social services this morning. It comes as guidance issued to nursery teachers expected to identify signs of radicalisation in children were slammed as 'heavy handed'. It comes as guidance for nursery teachers is being considered as part of a new counter terrorism Bill. Above, a toddler poses with a gun in front of the Islamic State flag . British fighter Siddharta Dhar, who has been linked to Anjem Choudary, poses with his newborn baby . Home Office documents being considered as part of a counter terrorism bill state senior management and governors need to be able to challenge extremist views and eradicate intolerance among toddlers. The advice was described as 'unworkable' by politicians today, while human rights activists said it would not help prevent the spread of terrorism. 'Are they supposed to report some toddler who comes in praising a preacher deemed to be extreme? I don't think so,' David Davis MP told the Telegraph. Isabella Sanky, policy director at human rights body Liberty added: 'The Government should focus on projects to support vulnerable, young people. 'Instead they are playing straight into terrorists' hands by rushing through a Bill that undermines our democratic principles and turns us into a nation of suspects.' A Home Office spokesman this morning told MailOnline: 'The new duty in the Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill, to have due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism will be seen in a similar way to their existing safeguarding responsibilities. 'We are not expecting teachers and nursery workers to carry out unnecessary intrusion into family life but we do expect them to take action when they observe behaviour of concern. 'For schools, including nurseries and other childcare providers, we would expect staff to have the training they need to identify children at risk of radicalisation and know where and how to refer them for further help if necessary.'

"The start of a new year means many Americans are taking up resolutions like working out regularly or starting a diet. But imagine committing yourself to abstain from one thing you really want, every day for the rest of your life. That's what one Pennsylvania man is doing, by ignoring his physical attraction towards other men in order to adhere to his strict interpretation of Christianity. Allan Edwards, pastor of Kiski Valley Presbyterian Church, is so committed to his faith that he married a woman and the pious couple are expecting a baby in July. Scroll down for video . Devoted to his faith: Allan Edwards (right) says he is sexually attracted to men, but does not act out on the urges because of his faith. Pictured above with his wife Leanne (left). The couple are expecting a baby in July . The 31-year-old, who doesn't consider himself gay, says he first noticed he was attracted to men in the mid-90s. 'It was a pretty immediate realization that it was in conflict with my faith,' he told NPR. He decided to be more open with his feelings when he started at Grove City College, though he feared he would be ostracized at the small Christian liberal arts school. Surprisingly, Edwards says he was overwhelmed by support. Edwards considered joining a Christian denomination that accepted gays but ultimately decided against it since he couldn't reconcile his fundamentalist beliefs with homosexuality. 'I studied different methods of reading the scripture and it all came down to this: Jesus accepts the rest of the scripture as divined from God,' he told NPR. 'So if Jesus is who he says he is, then we kind of have to believe what he believes.' Acceptance: Edwards first started feeling attractions toward men when he was an adolescent, but wasn't open about his feelings until college. He says he was accepted at Grove City College, a small Christian liberal arts school in Pennsylvania . Edwards and his wife Leeanne first met each other at Christian summer camp, but only started dating several years later when they both applied to be the camp's director. Leeanne got the job, and Edwards later invited her to lunch when she was getting ready to leave the position. It was at that meeting that the two started falling in love, Edwards said. 'We got off talking about the job and started talking about our experience of the last couple years,' Edwards recalled. 'I don't want to be gushy or romantic, but I just melted inside, and thought, this is someone who understands graciousness. This is someone who understands acceptance, and this is someone I want to spend as much time with as possible.' Edwards clarifies that even though he is attracted to men, does not mean he is not physically attracted to his wife. Quite the contrary. 'I'm not universally attracted to all men, nor am I universally attracted to all women. I am physically, emotionally, and spiritually attracted to my wife,' he told Daily Mail Online. Edwards adds that while physical attraction is important in a marriage, he believes it's not the most important part and that sexual activity is 'best experienced in marriage between a man in a woman'. Leeanne knew about his attractions before marriage, and confesses that she was curious how it would impact their relationship. However, she now considers his attractions normal, comparing them to the same kind of temptations heterosexual couples experience in their own marriages. 'There's always going to be situations where a partner is sexually attracted to someone else and isn't necessarily dealing with sexual attraction with their partner,' Leeanne said. Edwards was just as forthcoming with these feelings when he first applied to the the pastor at Kiski Valley Presbyterian Church. Pious man: Edwards is now the pastor at Kiski Valley Presbyterian Church in the western part of Pennsylvania. He says he was open with his same-sex attractions through the interview process to be pastor at the church, and preaches about his own experiences on occasion . 'The first question a congregant asked in my interview in front of the whole church was ""What is your biggest struggle in life?"" and I shared this part of my story with the church,' Edwards told Daily Mail Online. 'I preach on issues of sexuality when they come up in the scripture text that day, but it's not a hobby horse of mine.' In the end, Edwards says he believes his devotion to God is more important that his earthly desires towards men. 'I think we all have part of our desires that we choose not to act on, right?' he said. 'So for me, it's not just that the religion was important to me, but communion with a God who loves me, who accepts me right where I am.' However, marriage isn't something that he recommends for all Christian men who experience the same same-sex feelings as himself. 'I'm blessed to have a couple friends who also experience same sex attraction and chose to marry, some who chose to remain celibate, and some who came to disagree with me and believe that there's nothing wrong with their attraction and entered homosexual relationships. I can honestly say that all the Christians I know who experience same sex attraction have different ways of talking about their sexuality, sometimes in small nuances and shades, sometimes with significant differences,' he told Daily Mail Online.","Allan Edwards, pastor of Kiski Valley Presbyterian Church, first noticed he was attracted to men in the mid-90s but doesn't consider himself gay .

"A Syrian refugee who piloted more than 700 illegal migrants on the Italian 'Ghost Ship'  has claimed a trafficking gang offered him nearly £10,000 to be 'captain' of the abandoned vessel. Sarkas Rani, 36, took charge of the Blue Sky M, one of two large ships that were locked on a course towards Italian shores this week, with hundreds of Syrian asylum seekers on board. Mr Rani claims he was contacted by human traffickers who allegedly posted several messages on Facebook offering migrants covert passage to Europe  for £3,500. Scroll down for video . A Syrian asylum-seeker who piloted nearly 770 illegal migrants on board the Blue Sky M vessel to Italy (pictured) has claimed he was appointed as the 'captain' of the ship by a trafficking gang . Sarkas Rani, 36, was allegedly approached by a gang to captain the ship, which was one of two large vessels that brought hundreds of asylum seekers from Syria towards Italy's shores last week . The former sailor allegedly told police that he was offered free passage, $15,000 and the possibility of his family being sent to Italy too, if he captained the ship. Separately, police have revealed that human traffickers could have earned around £2million for taking more than 350 illegal migrants on a second ship that was intercepted by the Italian navy just 48 hours later. According to the Telegraph, an Italian newspaper reported comments made by Mr Rani during police interrogation after the ship was intercepted on New Year's Eve. Mr Rani allegedly told police that the trafficking gang had asked him to commandeer the ship after finding out that he used to work as a sailor. He told officers that it would save the gang having to make an exit from the boat when it neared European waters. 'They promised me $15,000 and the possibility of sending my entire family over,' Mr Rani was reported as saying. The Blue Sky M, which was intercepted on Wednesday, had recently had its safety certificates withdrawn after it was ruled unseaworthy. It was originally heading for the port of Rijeka in Croatia, but the ship abruptly changed direction on Tuesday morning, heading west towards Italy. This is thought to have been when the smugglers abandoned their human cargo to its fate. Chills: Blue Sky M arrived at the southern Italian port of Gallipoli, Italy, on New Years Eve . According to reports, Mr Rani admitted leaving the bridge to hide among the migrant passengers once he set the autopilot toward Italy's southern shore. By the time Italian naval officers boarded the ship, it was close to running aground in what could have led to a fatal sinking. After it docked in the Italian port of Gallipoli, hundreds of desperately cold men, women and children carrying their few remaining possessions were helped to safety. Wrapped in blankets, they stumbled off the ship to waiting aid workers and ambulances. One woman holding a young child collapsed and several had to be carried on stretchers. Many of the migrants had been forced to huddle for hours on the main deck, and more than 100 were treated for hypothermia. Mr Rani said his participation in the people-smuggling venture began when he left Lebanon, where he had sought refuge from the civil war ravaging Syria, to spend time in Turkey. It has emerged that human traffickers earned around £2million from 359 illegal migrants who were brought towards Italian shores in a cattle ship 48 hours later . Migrants wait after disembarking from the cargo ship Ezadeen,  in the southern Italian port of Corigliano, Italy, om Saturday . He said that he and the other asylum seekers boarded the ship at Turkey's Mersin port, which has become a haven for people-smuggling gangs trafficking refugees from the Syrian war into Europe. Two days later, the Ezadeen, carrying 360 migrant passengers, was intercepted by the Italian navy and towed to port. The Sierra Leone-flagged livestock carrier was found drifting without power about 40 nautical miles off the southern Italian coast. The police chief of Cosenza province, Luigi Liguori, told the BBC that each migrant had paid between $4,000 and $8,000 to board the ship. The migrants were said to have worn hoods and locked the migrants in the ship's hold before abandoning ship. It had been put on a collision course for the Italian coast but ran out of fuel, officials said. Passengers are said to be in good condition and are being transferred to immigration centres and foster homes across Italy, according to coastguard and police officials. Migrants look out from Ezadeen, where they had been kept in livestock pens  with few supplies . European border officials believe last week's events represent part of a new tactic by trafficking gangs, who have started buying boats on the black market and then abandon them close to European shores. Last year it is estimated that nearly 3,500 refugees died trying to cross the Mediterranean while another 200,000 were rescued. But hundreds, and possibly thousands, have perished trying to make the crossing. Trafficking gangs send boats over in the knowledge that those who are picked up by the European authorities are likely to be granted asylum. The Turkish government has been accused of not doing enough to stem the flow of migrants from Syria. Illegal migration to the EU has been fuelled by the civil war in Syria, which has driven people to seek asylum in Europe, along with economic migrants.","Sarkas Rani, 36, took charge of Blue Sky M, intercepted near Italy last week .

"Prince Charles is said to be 'furious' over the controversy that has arisen out of the postponed BBC documentary based on the royal family's relationship with the media. The Prince has seen two of the royal household's most influential officials become embroiled in an embarrassing row over the show, which was supposed to be televised this evening. The documentary, Reinventing the Royals, investigates the methods used by the Prince to enhance his public image following the death of Princess Diana - and to integrate Camilla Parker Bowles into palace life – a campaign dubbed 'Operation Mrs PB'. Scroll down for video . 'Furious': The Prince of Wales is said to be furious at the controversy that has arisen from the postponed BBC documentary Reinventing The Royals . The BBC was forced to postpone the show after Prince Charles's staff at Clarence House refused to supply archive footage, The Sunday Times reports. The refusal is the pinnacle of a row between Sally Osman, the director of communications at Buckingham Palace, and Kristina Kyriacou, Charles's top media adviser. Ms Osman, who works mainly for Prince William and the Queen, is said to be an old friend of Steve Hewlett - the BBC reporter behind Reinventing the Royals. The Buckingham Palace official is in favour of Mr Hewlett's project - despite his previous job as head of Panorama when it shook the royals in 1995 by broadcasting Princess Diana's confession of adultery. Dispute: Kristina Kyriacou (left), Charles's top media adviser, and Sally Osman, the director of communications at Buckingham Palace, are said to have a 'stressful relationship' But others, including Ms Kyriacou, are thought to be wary of the production. One royal source told the Sunday Times: 'Steve kept coming in with all these requests and they were being granted and no-one was going back to him asking 'what sort of programme are you making?' 'There are still people who think of (Hewlett) as this incredibly toxic person. The Prince of Wales is furious with the way this has been handled and Osman's role in it.' Ms Osman is said to have a 'stressful relationship' with Ms Kyriacou despite the pair insisting they work with each other on a daily basis. Ms Osman's style is thought to be more corporate - and the PR expert sees her job as managing the Prince's role in the succession process. Ms Kyriacou on the other hand is fuelled by the desire to protect Charles's reputation and public image while also promoting his personal interests. Most trusted aide: Charles, pictured with Ms Kyriaco (right) and one her previous clients Cheryl Fernandez-Versini at Clarence House in 2011 . Close relationship: Prince Charles's decision to stick with long-serving aide Ms Kyriacou (right) is thought to have put a strain on Sally Osman's goal of uniting the palace's diverse press teams . Palace officials have blamed Ms Kyriacou for 'giving oxygen' to the row over the documentary by withholding archive footage. But others have also criticised Ms Osman's relationship with BBC reporter Steve Hewlett, saying it 'wasn't appropriate'. The BBC said the documentary had been postponed to resolve issues surrounding archive footage, but the Radio Times said Clarence House had intervened to halt the programme. 'Toxic': Many in the palace are wary of BBC reporter Steve Hewlett - the man behind the documentary Reinventing the Royals . Clarence House has previously denied asking for the show to be cancelled or postponed, but royal sources confirmed there had been 'detailed' talks with the BBC throughout the making of the documentary, The Telegraph reports. The footage includes the first-ever television interview with Sandy Henney, who was press secretary to Prince Charles at the time of Princess Diana's death. Even before the accident, the Prince was worried his image was 'in tatters' while the Royal family were also alarmed by the anti-monarchist feeling following the Diana's death in Paris. '(Charles) was getting some pretty virulent criticism - bad father, unloving husband,' Ms Henney said in the documentary. 'I think he was pretty hurt... if you've got a middle-aged balding man and a beautiful princess, it's a no-brainer as to who is going to get the media coverage.' Steve Hewlett presents the show and describes how Prince Charles hired Mark Bolland from the Press Complaints Commission to act as a spin doctor for the Royal family following Diana's death. Prince William is said to have felt uneasy with Mr Bolland's position and referred to him as 'Blackadder'. The spin doctor features heavily in both parts of Reinventing the Royals. Behind the argument over the documentary, which began filming almost a year ago, lies a broader conflict over the Prince's role in the years to come. The documentary investigates the methods used by the Prince to enhance his public image following the death of Princess Diana. BBC reporter Steve Hewlett, centre . Since her appointment, Sally Osman has been faced with the challenging task of uniting the diverse PR teams of the Queen, Prince Charles and the younger royals. This goal was damaged by Charles's decision to stick with long-serving aide Ms Kyriacou, who previously worked for Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Gary Barlow. A BBC source said that uniting the press offices was seen as way of keeping Prince Charles on the straight and narrow - but the job is difficult as Ms Kyriacou always has Charles's ear.

"'Gobsmacked': David Hatton was banned from buying a Jaguar because he is a motor trader . A second-hand car trader was told by a Jaguar dealership that he was not allowed to buy a new £65,000 F-Type from them - despite agreeing to the deal the day before. David Hatton, 42, said he was forced to leave the showroom with 'his tail between his legs' during the embarrassing incident. The father believes Jaguar bosses fear motor traders will sell on their vehicles for a quick profit, like 1980s sitcom character Arthur Daley. Daley featured in Minder, a British comedy about London's criminal underworld, and famously drove a silver Jaguar. Mr Hatton, from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, was hoping to purchase the classic car for personal use only. The married father-of-two went to the Jaguar dealership, HA Fox, of Nottingham, last week with his wife Stacey, 49, with the intention of buying a second-hand model, priced at around £58,000. But he was soon persuaded to go for a new car and agreed a deal with a salesman after hours of negotiation. He told them he would come back the following day to finalise the deal and place a deposit on the vehicle. But when he returned to the showroom with his brother, he was told that the dealership's manager had called off the agreement and insisted they would never sell him a car. Mr Hatton said: 'We were absolutely gobsmacked. We literally couldn't believe it. 'There was a bit of nervous laughter and we basically had to leave the showroom with our tails between our legs. 'When they first broke it to us, there was some discussion about how they could potentially sell my wife the vehicle if she came with her own insurance.

"The dismembered body of an endangered rhinoceros has been discovered in Kaziranga National Park in India. As these images show, the male one-horned rhino was killed by poachers, who sawed off the animal's horn before escaping. This comes just weeks after a female one-horned rhino was butchered for its horn and left to die in a pool of it's own blood in the same area of the national park. Brutal: Forest officials stand near the carcass of the one-horned rhinoceros that was killed and de-horned by poachers in the Burapahar range of Kaziranga National Park on Sunday .

'The staff did hear the sound of gunshots from the Burhapahar range and before the forest guards could extensively comb the area and spot the carcass, the poachers had sawed off the rhino’s horn and escaped from the scene,' a park official told local website IndiLeak. Earlier this week, two poachers were killed in an encounter with park rangers in Kaziranga. Park officials say five or six poachers had entered the park aiming to kill rhinos, and the rest of the group escaped.

The one-horned rhino is one of the most threatened species in India, and just 3,000 are believed to be living in the wild . Illegal rhinoceros horn poaching is one of the major environmental issues in the park, with animal body parts such as the toenails and skin having a high value on the Asian medicinal market. The Indian rhinoceros, also known as the one-horned rhino, is listed as a vulnerable species. The mammal is mostly found in the Assam state and in protected areas of Nepal. The one-horned rhino once ranged throughout the Indo-Gangetic Plain, but their numbers were greatly reduced by hunting. However, more than 3,000 are still thought to live in the wild, of which more than 2,500 are believed to be in Assam alone. There are five different species of rhinoceros, and all are threatened to some degree. Although poaching drastically reduced their numbers in the 1900s, numbers have steadily increased in recent years. In December, park workers found a rhino left to die in a pool of its own blood in the Kaziranga National Park .

"When the Conservatives unveiled their first poster of the election campaign, critics branded it bland and 'a bit French'. But it turns out they were wrong. The image used to claim Britain is on the 'road to a stronger economy' is actually German. Tory spin doctors at least had the sense to remove the cracks and potholes in the original image, but George Osborne's claim that it was 'a British picture, a British road' has left the Chancellor with some explaining to do. Scroll down for video . Green and pleasant land: The flag says this Tory election poster depicts Britain the image is not quite what it seems . Today it was claimed that the road is not even in Britain, but is based on this image taken by German photographer Alexander Burzik in Weimar . All the main parties have sought to use the start of the year to launch the first shots of what will be a long election campaign. Senior Tories, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg will all use public appearances today to set out their stall to voters. But posters released by Labour and the Tories have faced criticism for their accuracy, or lack of it. The Conservative poster was launched on Friday, depicting an empty road carving through green fields has already caused controversy for being bland, ambiguous, and a touch French. But the words on the image caused problems for Mr Cameron, with the claim: 'The deficit halved'. The claim infuriated some experts, who pointed out that the deficit – the annual gap between the Government's spending and income – has been reduced from a peak of £153billion at the time of the election to £91billion this year, a fall of just over 40 per cent. Prime Ministr David Cameron launched the Conservative Party poster at an event in Halifax on Friday . Mr Cameron stressed at the poster's launch on Friday that the claim was to have halved the deficit in relation to GDP. Tory sources said the party had always been 'clear that when we talk about the deficit being halved that's what we are referring to'. Now it has emerged that that the road is not even in Britain, but is based on an image taken by German photographer Alexander Burzik in Weimar. At the weekend Mr Osborne insisted: 'It's a British picture, a British road.' But while the horizon between the two images differs, the verges bare an uncanny similarity. Some efforts have been made to cover up the deception. The entire image has been flipper, cracks and discoloration removed from the road surface and the white lines erased. The white clouds in the blue sky have also been rearranged. Labour shadow cabinet minister Lord Wood said on Twitter: 'There's something perfect about the Tories' 'road to a stronger economy' actually being a photo of the road to Weimar.' This is a reference to the disastrous economic situation in 1930s Weimar Germany. Meanwhile, Labour has released a campaign image based on a poster of Mr Cameron used by the Tories in 2010. The Labour poster, to be used online, says: 'The Tories want to cut spending on public services back to the levels of the 1930s, when there was no NHS. 'The NHS as you know it cannot survive five more years of David Cameron.' It is based on warnings from the Office for Budget Responsibility last month that forecast total government spending will fall to just 35.2 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 – the lowest level for 80 years. According to the OBR, government spending falling to just 35.2 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 marks a dramatic decline from 45.3 per cent in 2009-10, the last year of the Labour government. In the mid-1970s state spending accounted for almost half of the entire economy. However, total government spending will still be spending £765billion-a-year, compared to under £100billion in real terms in the late 1940s. A Conservative source said: 'The New Year has only started and Labour are already resorting to wild scaremongering. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility was crystal clear - under our plan to deal with the deficit, day-to-day public spending will return to the levels of 2002-03. In contrast, Ed Miliband has no plan and would plunge the economy back into chaos.' Mr Cameron today insisted that further spending cuts were needed to get the nation's debts under control. Labour has launched this web image today, attacking the Tories over spending cuts, but the reference to the 1930s is in connection with spending as a proportion of the whole economy, not cash sum . David Cameron today insisted that further spending cuts were needed to get the nation's debts under control . He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'Look what happened in countries like Portugal and Greece who saw their debts and deficits get out of control. They had to cut their NHS by 16 per cent, 17 per cent. 'What I fear with Labour is you have a bunch of politicians who have learnt nothing from the last five years. 'My concern is this, if you want to get families out of poverty you've got to get your debt and your deficit under control. That is line one of the long-term economic plan for the country which is working. 'I am a compassionate conservative: compassion isn't just measured in the money that you spend, compassion is measured in creating a growing economy so you can have the stronger NHS, stronger social services.' But Labour's shadow treasury minister Chris Leslie said: 'David Cameron says he is happy to be judged on his record over five years. This is a record of an NHS going backwards, working people £1600 a year worse off and £200 billion more borrowing than planned. 'He should also be judged on his risky and extreme plans for the future, which the OBR says will take public spending as a share of national income back to the 1930s. This will have a hugely damaging impact on our defence, policing and local services. 'And on top of this David Cameron has made over £7 billion of unfunded tax promises. These could only be paid for by another Tory VAT rise, even deeper cuts to public spending - or both.'","Criticism of first posters from Labour and the Tories of election campaign .

"An ‘army of legal superstars’ persuaded prosecutors to sign a controversial agreement which may have given Prince Andrew protection from prosecution, it is claimed. Highly-paid lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein – some of whom had links to the White House – secured an extraordinary deal which guaranteed ‘potential co-conspirators’ would not face criminal charges relating to his activities. They had spent months delving into the private lives of state prosecutors to establish if they had any ‘personal peccadilloes’, in a desperate bid to defend Epstein against claims of abusing scores of under-age girls at his Florida mansion. Scroll down for video . Claims: The Duke of York, left, with Jeffrey Epstein in 2011. The billionaire's lawyers persuaded prosecutors to sign a agreement which may have given Prince Andrew protection from prosecution, it is claimed . The aggressive tactics culminated in an extraordinary ‘non-prosecution agreement’ being struck between Epstein and prosecutors in September 2007. This halted any prospect of Andrew being asked to answer questions on oath about his paedophile friend’s antics. The agreement states: ‘The United States agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff or Nadia Marcinkova.’ Many serious charges against Epstein and any ‘co-conspirators’ were wiped out, in return for the billionaire pleading guilty to the relatively minor charge of soliciting an under-age girl for prostitution. After the accord had been signed, his lawyers fought to ensure it remained secret. They bombarded the US Attorney’s office in Florida with hundreds of pages of legal argument intended to prove that Epstein’s victims did not have any legal right to know a plea agreement had been struck. According to official documents, Epstein’s attorney Jay Lefkowitz – a former deputy director of domestic policy at the White House under George W Bush – sent a one-line email to the US Attorney’s Office on September 24, 2007: ‘Please do whatever you can to keep this from becoming public’. On November 29, 2007, Lefkowitz called for more secrecy in a letter to the Florida state attorney: ‘We don’t understand the basis for your Office’s belief that it is appropriate for any letter to be sent to these individuals at this stage – before Mr Epstein has either entered a plea or been sentenced.’ Lefkowitz disputed the suggestion that the victims had the right to be heard at any plea or sentencing, adding: ‘Encouraging these individuals to participate in the state sentencing will have the effect of creating a media frenzy that will surely impact the sentence Mr Epstein received – precisely what your Office promised to avoid.’ Andrew may be entitled to diplomatic immunity against questioning in any criminal inquiry because some of the allegations relate to when he was a Whitehall-sanctioned business envoy. Diplomatic immunity provides foreign diplomats protection from legal action in the country where they work. It is granted depending on an individual’s rank and the level of immunity they need to carry out their duties. But diplomats are still expected to follow the laws of their host countries. In the US, several levels of immunity protecting foreign diplomats from legal action are granted. Extradition lawyer Karen Todner, who represented computer hacker Gary McKinnon, said the prince could simply ignore any request to give evidence. ‘If proceedings are civil, extradition [law] does not apply, so he can just refuse to go,’ she said. He could be compelled to give evidence ‘only in criminal proceedings’, she added. If he refused to co-operate, however, the prince could be banned from entering the US. It is not known whether Andrew might be covered by legal immunity simply by being a royal because this has never been tested in international law. Critics claim the deal was a scandalous cover-up – supported by the political establishment – to protect Epstein and his influential circle of friends. R Alexander Acosta, the US Attorney for Southern Florida, who signed off on the non-prosecution agreement, has told of the aggressive tactics employed. In an open letter on the case four years ago, Mr Acosta said Epstein had ‘hired an army legal superstars’, citing Lefkowitz and Kenneth Starr – lead prosecutor against President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He added: ‘The defence strategy was not limited to legal issues. Defence counsel investigated individual prosecutors and their families, looking for personal peccadilloes that might provide a basis for disqualification. Defence counsel tried to disqualify at least two prosecutors.’ Mr Acosta said that ‘some may feel that the prosecution should have been tougher, adding: ‘Evidence that has come to light since 2007 may encourage that view. Many victims have since spoken out, filing detailed statements in civil cases seeking damages. Physical evidence has since been discovered. Had these additional statements and evidence been known, the outcome may have been different.’ Epstein’s treatment during his year in prison, where he is reported to have had an easy ride, ‘undermined the purpose of a jail sentence’ and may ‘encourage the view’ that prosecutors should have been ‘tougher’ with him, Mr Acosta said. Despite these comments, questions remain over why he and fellow US prosecutors agreed to provide a blanket immunity to men and women who had allegedly been involved in Epstein’s crimes. The disgraced financier has spent huge amounts of time, effort and money making sure there is no evidence to implicate third parties. The potential co-conspirators who have been named publicly have all kept quiet. Former model Adriana Ross, who is referred to in the non-prosecution agreement, refused to answer any questions, including some about Prince Andrew, when deposed by lawyers representing Epstein’s victims. Other key friends in his circle were equally reticent when asked on oath about his activities. If the allegations against any famous public figures are true, the agreement means the US government has provided them with an extraordinary get-out-of-jail free card. Prince Andrew pictured with Virginia Roberts and Ghislaine Maxwell, right, in 2001 . Experts in criminal law in America still question how Epstein’s legal team pulled off the deal that saw him avoid a jail sentence of ten to 20 years. Possibly the most critical question is whether the FBI was aware of any allegations involving Prince Andrew when the non-prosecution agreement was signed. Buckingham Palace refuses to comment on whether the prince has ever been interviewed by the FBI – even as a witness – over Epstein’s liaisons with young girls. Epstein was released in July 2009. In recent days, there have been claims that the prince lobbied on behalf of his disgraced friend for a reduced jail term. This has been denied by Buckingham Palace. A royal official said: ‘The duke would never interfere in an active legal case and did not do so in this case.’ But more than a year after his release from jail, Epstein was pictured walking in New York’s Central Park with Andrew – a show of loyalty from the prince which has repercussions to this day. Envoy and minister left facing questions . By Sam Marsden for the Daily Mail . Former UK ambassador to Washington Sir David Manning, pictured, faced questions tonight . A former British ambassador and an ex-Foreign Office minister faced questions last night about what they discussed with Prince Andrew while Jeffrey Epstein was under police investigation. The Duke of York met then-UK ambassador to Washington Sir David Manning in September 2006, one month after the billionaire pleaded not guilty to soliciting prostitution. Official records show that he also had a meeting with then-Foreign Office minister Kim Howells in July 2005, four months after American detectives launched their inquiry into Epstein. Both Sir David and Dr Howells were in their roles at a time when Epstein was enjoying a decadent life among global high society. Royal sources insisted the prince did not interfere in the active legal case against the wealthy US paedophile. But he may have been concerned that he would himself face questioning about what – if anything – he knew of Epstein’s activities. Epstein had previously attended a weekend party at the Queen’s Sandringham estate in 2000, and was a guest at the Queen’s birthday party in Windsor that same year. The prince also holidayed in Thailand with the financier in 2001. As the UK’s special trade envoy until 2011, Prince Andrew travelled widely around the world at this time promoting British businesses overseas – including in America. But the topics of his conversations with British and US officials are unknown. He made three official trips to America while Epstein was under investigation, including two in September 2006. One was to mark the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in New York, while the other was to Washington. The prince visited again in February 2008, five months after US federal prosecutors concluded a secret plea bargain with the financier that guaranteed he and any ‘potential co-conspirators’ would not face criminal charges. He started this third trip in Florida, the location of Epstein’s home where much of the alleged sexual abuse took place. There is nothing to suggest that the prince visited his friend or intervened on his behalf at this time. A royal official said: ‘The duke would never interfere in an active legal case, and did not do so in this case.’ Speaking from his home in South Wales yesterday, Dr Howells insisted he had not been at any meeting with the duke in July 2005 but could offer no explanation as to why the official records might be incorrect. He said he knew nothing about Epstein’s case, adding: ‘I do remember meeting Prince Andrew once in Qatar, but all he talked about was himself and what a good ambassador he was.’ Sir David, who is now an aide to Prince William, could not be reached for comment last night.

"A large wind turbine worth £500,000 mysteriously collapsed on an Irish mountainside during light winds. The 262ft tall structure was found buckled and destroyed at Screggagh wind farm on Murley Mountain in County Tyrone, Fintona. An investigation has now been launched into what caused the huge structure to collapse amid the sound of grinding metal, which could be heard as far away as seven miles. Scroll down for video . The 262ft tall metal wind turbine collapsed at Screggagh wind farm on Murley Mountain in County Tyrone . It remains unclear why the turbine fell on Friday, during a period of light winds which reached around 15mph - the equivalent of a breeze. The wreckage of the turbine was a mass of twisted and buckled metal. Debris from the large mechanical structure was scattered across the mountain in northern Ireland, where it stood with eight others. It is understood the rotor blades spun out of control and the sound of the mechanical structure crashing to the ground was compared to an explosion. Others said they heard grinding metal and a sound like thunder as the huge structure fell. Doreen Walker, director of the wind farm, said: 'There were fortunately no injuries and no personnel on site at the time. Sounds of grinding metal and the large structure collapsing could be heard as far as seven miles away . We are currently investigating the circumstances that led to the collapse of the turbine at Screggagh wind farm. 'We are however satisfied that the site's precautionary health and safety alert processes worked well with local emergency services in attendance within minutes of the incident taking place. Ms Walker said they were 'working closely' with Nordex UK, the supplier of the wind farm turbines, to ensure the site is safe. The cause of the fall is being investigated after the turbine bucked during a period of mild winds at the farm site . The turbine fell during a period of light winds on the mountain, in the region of Fintona at Murley Mountain . 'A further statement will be made once the investigation has been completed and the reasons for the failure confirmed,' she added. In January last year a 115ft tall turbine was felled by gales in Bradworthy in Devon. Months later three turbines - built to withstand winds of  up to 115mph fell when speeds barely reached 50mph in Devon. The Health and Safety Executive found the cause of the crashing turbines was due to faults in the way they had been put together, which could have affected hundreds of others . The wind turbine was one of eight at the farm in Screggagh wind farm in the Fintona region of Northern Ireland .","Wind turbine collapsed on Murley Mountain in County Tyrone, Ireland .

The estate, which is on the market for offers in excess of £9.5million, also includes a castle (behind), as well as the main house and gardens . The main house, which is built from Bath stone and set in a sprawling estate in rural Devon countryside, boasts large bedrooms and reception rooms, as well as an additional attic which contains a further 11 bedrooms. The mansion is approached by a long winding drive through 70 acres of woodland and has galleried halls, landings and corridors, a main kitchen/breakfast room, a secondary kitchen/butler's pantry and extensive domestic offices and cellars. There is also a two-bedroom staff bungalow together with garages, outbuildings and an estate yard. In the grounds, there is also a grade II listed Georgian castle, which boasts six offices and is included in the sale price. The castle, designed by British architect Anthony Salvin, is a replica of the 14th century Belsay Castle in Northumberland. Constructed of local red sandstone, it was originally used to provide stabling, a coach house, laundry and brewery. A passage linked the brewery with the house cellars. Today, the castle has been completely modernised and is laid out in six office suites which can be let to provide an additional income, although they are vacant at present. Visitors to the castle are met by a central courtyard, before being directed through a massive gatehouse complete with portcullis to the historic building. The 164-acre estate overlooks a stunning Italian sunken garden which features a Salvin fountain and sundial, as well as large swathes of beautiful parkland with views of the east Devon coast to Portland Bill. James Baker, head of Strutt & Parker in Exeter, described both the castle and main house as having 'gothic influences' and said the estate was an 'exciting opportunity' for a potential buyer. He said: 'If you want a picturesque stately home in the south west, Mamhead is the finest opportunity to present itself in years and undoubtedly one of the most important houses in the south of England. 'Tucked away in the Haldon Hills, you get complete privacy and stunning countryside, yet you are easily accessible to the M5 and Exeter airport. James Baker, head of estate agent Strutt & Parker, described the sprawling country estate an 'exciting opportunity' for a potential buyer . The main house has galleried halls, landings and corridors, as well as flowing corridors leading to the large, spacious reception rooms . The Mamhead estate was established in the 13th century and has had a house in its grounds ever since, although it has been refurbished . The estate is being advertised as the 'finest opportunity to present itself in years and one of the most important houses in southern England' 'The house is particularly suited to a buyer who is interested in a historical property, with Mamhead being Grade I listed with classical Georgian proportions and gothic influences. 'I would describe the house as one fit for a Queen, quite literally having hosted royalty, and in fact, Queen Adelaide, wife to William IV, stayed so often that a bedroom was set aside for her sole use and is still called ""The Queen's Room"". 'The house, the castle which is now offices, staff bungalow, outbuildings, agricultural land and woodland which is all on offer, provide a hugely diverse and exciting opportunity.' The Mamhead estate was established in the 13th century and has had a house in its grounds ever since, although the main house has been refurbished on several occasions. The original house was bought by the Balle family and in 1672, Peter Balle - an attorney to Queen Henrietta Maria - was awarded a Baronetcy for his services to her. Later, William of Orange billeted his supporters on the Estate. Mamhead then passed into the hands of the Earls of Lisburne, who sold the Estate in 1822 to R W Newman, MP for Exeter. The current Mamhead House was built around 1828 as a 'Marriage House' for Robert Newman and his new bride, Mary. The initials of both appear entwined throughout the house and the family motto, 'Ubi amor ibi fides' ('Where there is love there is trust') is beautifully carved above the front door and repeated in various places throughout the house. The estate continued in the family until 1985, but under the fifth baronet the house was let first as a holiday centre for evangelical clergy, and later as a school. The entire estate, which has now returned to being privately-owned, has now gone on the market with estate agent Strutt & Parker and offers in excess of £9.5million are being considered.

In the 13th Century, Mamhead belonged to the Peverell family, from whom it passed by marriage to Sir Nicholas Carew in the early 14th Century. In 1547 it was sold to Giles Balle of Axminster. Sir Peter Balle rebuilt an existing house near the parish church in the mid-17th Century. Sir Peter Balle and Thomas Balle were noted sylviculturists, and the latter introduced cork oaks, ilex oaks, wainscot or Turkey oaks, acacias, Spanish chestnuts and various cedars into his plantations. The Exeter nurseryman William Lucombe was employed as gardener at Mamhead by Thomas Balle. The early and mid-18th Century gardens were formal, with terraces, fountains and pools on the hillside above the House. In 1749, Thomas Balle, the last of the family, left Mamhead to his relative Thomas Apreece, who sold it to Joseph Nightingale. From Nightingale it passed by inheritance in 1755 to the third Viscount Lisburne, created Earl of Lisburne in 1776. In 1769, Robert Adam provided plans for the improvement of the house and alteration of a cascade house, which appear to have been implemented, while in 1778 the grounds were improved with the advice of Lancelot Brown. Mamhead remained the principal seat of the earls of Lisburne until 1822, when the estate was sold by the third Earl to R W Newman, a merchant from Dartmouth and MP for Exeter. A new mansion designed by Anthony Salvin (1799-1881) was built from 1828, and the old house near the church demolished on its completion in 1830. Newman was created a baronet in 1836, while his grandson, the fourth baronet, became the first and last Baron Mamhead in 1931. The estate continued in the family until 1985, but under the fifth baronet the house was let first as a holiday centre for evangelical clergy, and later as a school. In 1999, it returned to being used as a private estate and has been under private ownership until it was put up for sale. - English Heritage .","Mamhead House boasts 16 bedrooms, 10 reception rooms and eight bathrooms plus an 11-bedroom separate attic .

The idea is that you use them to top up your make-up during the day or you can even use them instead of your usual products for a sheer, natural make-up look. Brilliant for on the go make-up, the papers replace your make-up bag with a product that can fit in your pocket. They are all contained neatly inside a wallet so they are lightweight and compact and won’t spill all over your handbag. They also have the added bonus of acting like blotting papers — favoured by make-up artists to absorb excess oil from the face to reduce shine — and an alternative to applying pressed powder to matte the skin which often looks cakey. It sounds too good to be true — like another gimmick designed to relieve us of our money. I decide to try them. The sheets of foundation powder cost £12.50 for 50 sheets — one is enough to cover the whole face. This works out at 25p per sheet, so slightly cheaper than my usual £26.55 bottle of Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation, which lasts three months. But still, I am sceptical. My skin can be blotchy and red, so I like my foundation to be thick and creamy. The Mai Coutur Papiers (pictured) are available infused with foundation, blusher, highlighter and bronzer. The sheets of foundation powder cost £12.50 for 50 sheets — one is enough to cover the whole face . I’m of the ‘more is more’ school when it comes to a base — I don’t believe a tiny square of tissue paper will give me the coverage I want. I sweep the foundation paper all over my face, pressing more firmly where I need more coverage. I must admit that it goes on easily and smoothly and gives more coverage than I was expecting, but it is too powdery. It collects on the dry skin on my chin and forehead, I keep trying to blot and blend with the paper but, as a result, I keep putting more powder on, which is not what I want. And even though I use the palest of the three shades available, it’s a bit too orange for my skin. So far, so unimpressive. Next I try the trio pack of blusher, bronzer and highlighter sheets. I’ve never got on well with bronzer. I prefer to stay pale and interesting and on the couple of times I’ve tried it, my skin colour looks fake and Essex-y. Not with this one. Because the powder on the sheets is so fine — it’s talc free — it goes on so lightly that you barely notice it, but it gives a gorgeous soft glow with a slight shimmer. I love it, but not as much as I love the highlighter sheets. Like bronzer, I’ve never got the hang of highlighter. I have tried a product called High Beam by Benefit — which comes in a nail varnish-like applicator — but it’s messy and I lost patience with it, but this is totally different. I fold up the paper and blot it on the top of my cheekbones — and voila! The result is soft, but illuminating. No mess, no streaks. It’s so easy. Finally, I pat the blusher paper on the apples of my cheeks. I apply a shade called Sunset Boulevard — and with one papery push my cheeks are the prettiest, most natural glow. I can honestly say it’s the best blusher I’ve ever tried. The overall effect was a revelation. I’m still not crazy about the foundation, but it blends well with the bronzer, blush and highlighter. I feel as if I’m not wearing any make-up, but my skin looks even and luminous. Mai Couture don’t do any eyeshadows, but I’m told the bronzer can also double as one. Mai Couture don't make a lip colour yet, Marianne (pictured) tested the papers out on her lips but although it looked nice initially, it quickly came off . It works a treat — I dab it on quite heavily to get the most colour of it and use a brush to blend it. It’s super fine and sits on my skin perfectly, giving some definition to my eyes without looking too heavy. They don’t do lip colour either, but I try the blush sheets on my lips to see what happens. I choose a darker blusher sheet and though it looks pretty it comes off within minutes. The next day I try a light dusting of the foundation sheet on top of my usual cream foundation and the effect is perfect — lightly matte, with a soft glow. Throughout the day I blot my skin with the foundation powder and the blusher, even doing it on the train without a mirror, and it works a treat. A revolution for practical make-up on the go and ideal for those of us who suffer from an oily complexion, paper make-up is more genius than gimmick. From now on I won’t leave home without my little book of powdered paper. Available from thisisbeautymart.com .","Mai Couture Papiers are infused with foundation and other products .

"John Lewis customers opted to shop from home at Christmas, with sales on the company’s website soaring by a fifth on 2013 figures. Online sales at the chain rose by an impressive 19 per cent – in stark contrast to its department stores, where the figure fell. Big sellers included Lego, coffee machines and the NutriBullet smoothie maker, which sold out. Boost: John Lewis recorded a massive increase in sales on Black Friday in the last weekend of November . The figures from Britain’s leading retailer are indicative of a shift in shopping habits away from the High Street, where numbers were down in December. John Lewis recorded a massive increase in sales on Black Friday in the last weekend of November, but numbers fell away in December. As a result, sales in the crucial week before Christmas fell for what is thought to be the first time in the history of John Lewis. But the switch to internet shopping and the impact of Black Friday boosted sales across the group by 5.8 per cent for the five weeks to December 27, taking them up to £777million. Sales in electricals and home technology rose by 6.8per cent. Homeware grew 2.3per cent and fashion, which includes beauty products, increased by 7.8per cent. Lego was the big toy success of the year, driven by the popularity of the Lego movie. Sales of sets during the week of Black Friday were up some 46per cent on the year before. NutriBullet .

In the post Christmas clearance sale, John Lewis was selling Lego Minifigures at the rate of more than 10 a minute. Molton Brown and Crabtree & Evelyn beauty sets also sold well, along with luxury pillows, pillowcases and towels. There were also strong sales of TVs, washing machines and laptops. A spokesman for John Lewis said: ‘Black Friday yielded an early sales peak. ‘It was the biggest week for sales in our 150-year history and was up 22 per cent on last year, with johnlewis.com experiencing a 300 per cent increase in traffic during the early hours of trading on Black Friday itself.’ The managing director at John Lewis, Andy Street, has argued that the rise of the web means retailers no longer need hundreds of high street outlets to have a national presence. He believes 60-70 should be enough for most chains. The big DIY warehouses, B&Q and Homebase, have announced major store closures, while the supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsbury’s have cancelled more than 100 larger hypermarkets. However, Mr Street insisted it would be wrong to write-off the high street, saying: ‘Our shops continue to have a critical role to play and will be a major development focus for us over the coming months. ‘To that end, we will be opening two further ""At Home"" shops in Horsham and Basingstoke in 2015 as well as our new regional flagship in the heart of Birmingham in September, which will set an exciting new benchmark in bricks and mortar retailing.’ Top pick: Big sellers included Lego, coffee machines and the NutriBullet smoothie maker, pictured .","Figures reflect shift in Britons' shopping habits away from the High Street .

"Britain is set to stay mostly dry today as millions of people return to work or school after the two-week Christmas and New Year break. But mist and fog will cover much of the country except for the North East, with light rain expected in parts of the North West and South East. And the Environment Agency has 16 flood alerts in place for England and Wales, as well as a more serious flood warning in Keswick, Cumbria. Scroll down for video . Misty: There was a heavy fog over the London skyline yesterday, but the dreary weather should clear for a busy day on the roads today . Wonderful: The fog in London yesterday was a far cry from the glorious start to the day in Scotland, with a beautiful sunrise in Loch Lomond . Peak District scene: People enjoyed a frosty morning in the grounds of Chatsworth House in Derbyshire yesterday . Looking at the camera: A highland cow steams in the winter chill yesterday morning during the frosty start to the day in Wardlow, Derbyshire . Forecast: Parts of southern England were shrouded in mist yesterday, but today should see a brighter day before scattered showers tomorrow . Tonight will be mild and cloudy with drizzle in the West - and whilst it will be largely dry elsewhere, fog patches will form, mainly across the Midlands. But tomorrow, there will be grey skies with drizzly conditions over England and Wales before a band of more organised rain moves south-east. Wednesday will be more unsettled with heavy rain and strong winds spreading eastwards during the day, with a risk of stormy weather in Scotland. Meanwhile, today is said to be one of the main days of the year for breakdowns, after many people leave their cars unused over the Christmas break. The Environment Agency has 16 flood alerts in place for England and Wales, as well as a more serious flood warning in Keswick, Cumbria . Beautiful: It was cold and crisp morning yesterday in Glen Nevis, Lochaber, in the Scottish Highlands with clear views across the mountains . It was bleak and grey start to the day in London yesterday with many of the capital's famous landmarks hard to pick out through the mist . There was a heavy fog in London yesterday morning - but it should be a clearer day today in time for many people returning to work . It was cold and foggy yesterday at Foots Cray Meadows in Sidcup, Kent, but conditions will improve today with a dry day forecast . It was a beautiful start to the day in the Scottish borders yesterday and it is set to be another sunny day north of the border today . AA spokesman Mark Spowage said the first working day in January is 'traditionally the busiest day of the year for breakdowns'. Mr Spowage, who was the organisation's 'patrolman of the year' for 2014, added that flat batteries were the main culprit. He said: 'The issue is that many cars get left unused for up to a fortnight in often cold conditions, which causes the power output of the battery to drop.' Yesterday in Cambridgeshire, the freezing fog and icy roads led to at least 14 accidents, with cars crashing in to hedges, lamp posts and fields.

"Reverend Al Sharpton is being paid thousands of dollars to not cry 'racism' at large corporations that are in the spotlight, it has been claimed. For more than 10 years, firms have reportedly handed over enormous donations and consulting fees to the activist preacher's National Action Network (NAN) In return for their cash, they have received Sharpton's supposed influence in the black community - or more often, his silence on the matter, it is reported. 'Al Sharpton has enriched himself and NAN for years by threatening companies with bad publicity if they didn’t come to terms with him,' said Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal & Policy Center, a watchdog group in Virginia that has produced a book on the Harlem minister. 'Making money': Reverend Al Sharpton is being paid thousands of dollars to not cry 'racism' at corporations who are in the spotlight, it has been claimed. He is reportedly doing so via his National Action Network (NAN) Recently, Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal met with Sharpton after leaked emails in the Sony hack apparently showed her mocking President Obama in a series of racially-charged exchanges. These exchanges included apparent remarks that the President only likes movies with black actors and subject matter, such as Django Unchained and 12 Years A Slave. The leak, which also revealed that British actor Idris Elba could be set to play the next James Bond, reportedly left Pascal and her colleagues 'shaking in their boots' and 'afraid of the Rev'. Pascal subsequently met with Sharpton, the New York Post reported. Although no donations or other payments to NAN have been announced, the pair agreed to form a 'working relationship'. This relationship aims to focus on racial bias in Hollywood, it is said. Experts told the newspaper that the lack of a public assertions of support for Pascal on Sharpton's behalf is exemplary of his typical 'shakedown' move - making people pay for his support or silence. 'Put simply, Sharpton specializes in shakedowns,' said Mr Boehmn. Keeping a low profile: Recently, Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal (pictured) met with Sharpton after leaked emails in the Sony hack apparently showed her mocking President Obama in a series of 'racist' exchanges . Another source, who apparently worked alongside Sharpton, added: 'Once Sharpton’s on board, he plays the race card all the way through. He just keeps asking for more and more money.' However, Sharpton - who has been vocal in the Eric Garner and Michael Brown cases - has denied that his meeting with Pascal was money-oriented in any way. In 2008, NAN received a $500,000 donation that was made to New York-based nonprofit Education Reform Now by Plainfield Asset Management, a Connecticut hedge fund. Although the money was apparently to support NAN's attempts to bring 'educational equality', it was donated at the same time the firm was trying to achieve a lucrative gambling deal in the Big Apple. Harold Levy, managing director at Plainfield at the time, has denied the contribution was made to win over Sharpton or aid Capital Play's efforts in the Aqueduct Racetrack deal. 'Al Sharpton has enriched himself and NAN for years by threatening companies with bad publicity if they didn’t come to terms with him,' said Ken Boehm (left). Right, Harold Levy  managing director at Plainfield at the time, has denied the firm's 2008 contribution was made to win over Sharpton or secure a lucrative gambling deal . Meanwhile, in 2003, Sharpton accused American Honda of not hiring enough African-American managers, saying: 'We cannot be silent while African-Americans spend hard-earned dollars with a company that does not hire, promote or do business with us in a statistically significant manner.' Shortly after his criticism, the firm's chiefs met with Sharpton and decided to sponsor NAN. After this, the racially-charged accusations stopped. During his 60th birthday party in October, Sharpton raised a staggering $1million for NAN, with donations from unions and an array of corporations, including AT&T and McDonald's. He has previously received money from the lakes of Macy's, General Motors and Pfizer.","Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network (NAN) has apparently been receiving thousands of dollars in donations from corporations .

"A man saw his life flash before his eyes as a car veered towards him with an unconscious driver behind the wheel but somehow he amazingly survived and went surfing two days later. It almost wasn't a very Merry Christmas for Tim McKeague, 29, when just three days earlier a female driver passed out and struck him at an uncontrollable speed on West Coast Drive in Perth. It's hard to believe from the shocking footage that Mr McKeague lived to tell the story - let alone walk away without any injuries from the frightening accident where the woman collected a total of three parked cars. Even more miraculously - the unconscious woman and the little girl, who was in the backseat, also survived the crash without any injuries. Scroll down for video . The out-of-control-car first hits the white ute on the side of the road on West Coast Drive in Perth . The car then collides with Tim McKeague who was standing beside the next parked car . The car eventually comes to a standstill after smashing into a third parked car while Mr McKeague can be seen rolling around in pain on the side of the road . Mr McKeague said he could see the driver was unconscious as the car was veering towards him. 'I just let go and let my body relax and the car just went straight through me,' he told Channel Nine News. Immediately after the crash, Mr McKeague couldn't move his right leg and paramedics thought it was broken. 'I started feeling more and more lucky as the minutes went past and as I got more feeling,' he said. 'It just kept getting more moveable and it was amazing - by the time I got to the hospital I was moving.' Two days later, the keen and extremely lucky surfer was back out in the water doing what he loves. Mark Doyle, and his son Jake, were taking a leisurely coastal drive when the vehicle in front of them unexpectedly smashed into the parked cars along the beachfront which was captured on their Dash Cam on Monday. Mr McKeague, 29, could not believe that he survived as he watched the footage of the Dash Cam . First thought to have broken his right leg, Mr McKeague went surfing tow days later . Jake (pictured) and Mark (right) were the first to rush to the aid of Mr McKeague who survived uninjured . More witnesses arrive and a woman walks around to check on the unconscious driver who also survived with no injuries along with the little girl in the backseat . Mark can be heard merrily whistling to a song by The Doors on the radio as they are driving along just seconds before the woman hit a parked vehicle, then struck the man who was standing by the next parked car before colliding with a third which forced her to come to a complete stop. The injured man can be seen rolling around in pain while holding his leg on the side of the road as Jake and Mark run to his aid and several other witnesses rush over to the scene. Mark posted the footage on Facebook on New Years Day with the comment : 'Ok people, new year, let's be careful out there. You never know who is on the roads.' The alarming video has been seen by more than 275,000 people and shared almost 3,500 times. Mark said in this post that the female driver told him that she had blacked out at the time. Mark and Jake were praised for rushing to the aid of the man with some social media users describing them as heroes. 'Thankfully it was only his leg and foot.. Well done you two for assisting... Just shows, you never know....' Karen Lawson posted.","Tim McKeague, 29, was uninjured after being struck by a car in Perth .

"Soldiers have been reminded who they are supposed to salute after senior officers complained they were not being enough shown respect by the lower ranks. The Ministry of Defence issued guidance on the hierarchy of military ranking after Army, Navy and RAF chiefs said younger officers were not saluting the right people. While a missed salute may seem like a petty complaint, there have been instances of top brass being called 'boss' or 'mate' by servicemen. Scroll down for video . Soldiers have been reminded who they are supposed to salute after top brass complained they were not being shown proper respect by lower ranks . The reminder, entitled the Pecking Order, suggested that the problem was growing because of an increase in joint operations between branches of the military, with soldiers unsure which members of other services they are supposed to salute. An RAF source told the Daily Telegraph: 'There's been some concern that this has been going on. This has been pushed forward hard by top brass and it appeared in the journal after a prod from someone high up. 'It's been done in a light-hearted manner, but behind it, it's pretty serious.' The guide, published in an in-house MoD journal, says: 'As anyone who works in defence knows, there are clearly defined rank structures. But, while the pecking order may be clear within your own Service, equivalent ranks or grades in the other Services may be less apparent. 'With joint operations becoming increasingly common and many bases run by a mix of uniformed and civilian MoD staff, you need to know where you stand. The Ministry of Defence issued guidance in the hierarchy of military ranking after Army, Navy and RAF chiefs said younger officers were not saluting the right people . 'If nothing else, we hope this helps you know whom you should salute and to find your way to the correct mess.' Another military source said: 'You would be amazed by some of the greetings [from young officers to those above them in the hierarchy].' While another added: 'Over the last decade, some have been very informal with each other. They often refer to a senior officer as boss, rather than sir. Some accept it, but others want to be called sir. It's been a minor problem for some time, but they are trying to keep it very much in check.'","Ministry of Defence issues guidance to soldiers on who they should salute .

"Prince Harry is being lined up as  commander of the Household Cavalry and could be in post by 2023 . Prince Harry is being tipped for a role as a 'future commander of the Household Cavalry', it has been reported. The royal, a serving captain in the Blues and Royals, is said to have passed all the necessary exams to be promoted to major and could advance to Lieutenant Colonel by 2023. He reportedly told friends he would be 'honoured' to take up the role in charge of the oldest and most senior regiment in the British Army. Captain Harry Wales, as he is known in the military, confided in colleagues that 'every serving officer wants to command their own regiment and I am no different,' according to the Daily Star. The 30-year-old prince was commissioned into the Blues and Royals, one of two regiments which make up the Household Cavalry, in 2006 and later trained as an Apache gunner and pilot. He is currently serving in a staff officer role at the Horse Guards Parade in London, a post he took up last year, although he is reportedly expected to rejoin his regiment next year. A senior officer told the paper: 'I am absolutely delighted Harry has set his sights high. Every officer at Harry's stage in his career should be thinking of his future and should be ambitious enough to want to command his regiment. 'There's nothing wrong with that. He is a very capable officer and has proved his worth in battle.' The prince has undertaken two operational tours of Afghanistan - in 2008 as a forward air controller and again in 2012 as an Apache pilot based at Camp Bastion in Helmand province. He was promoted to his current rank of captain in April 2011 and in July 2013 he qualified as an Apache aircraft commander. A promotion to commander of the Household Cavalry would make him the first serving royal general in history, while serving as a member of the Army. Made up of the Blues and Royals and the Life Guards, the regiments are split between two units, which operate different roles - and Harry could be put in charge of either. He is currently in a staff officer role at the Horse Guards Parade in London but is expected to return to his role in the Blues and Royals, which is one of the regiments that makes up the Household Cavalry . The Household Cavalry Regiment (HCR) has an operational role in armoured fighting vehicles and along with the five Foot Guards Regiments, form the Household Division, based at Windsor Castle. The second unit is the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment (HCMR), based at Knightsbridge, equipped with horses. Their role is to carry out ceremonial duties on state and royal occasions, including The Queen's Birthday Parade in June each year and the State Opening of Parliament.

"The anesthesiologist who was among the three physicians attending to Joan Rivers during the botched throat procedure that led to her death has finally been named. Dr. Renuka Reddy Bankulla, 46, was up until Sunday the sole unnamed doctor at present at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy during the August 28 procedure. Her identity was revealed Sunday as Rivers' daughter Melissa gears up to file a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the Upper East Side clinic. Named: Dr. Renuka Reddy Bankulla, 46, the anesthesiologist who was among the three physicians attending to Joan Rivers during the botched throat procedure that led to her death has finally been named . Dr. Bankulla, who was educated in India and trained in New York City, is no longer employed at the clinic, the New York Post reports. Not only has Dr. Bankulla declined to speak to the press, she refused to cooperate with investigators from the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service during their probe into the matter. She said only that she administered 120 milligrams of the anesthesia drug propofol and not the 300mg indicated in medical records. Bankulla claims she simply double clicked while entering the data to a computer, causing the error. According to the Post, she also failed to indicate Rivers weight, which is a vital bit of information for choosing the amount of anesthesia to administer. Rivers could have been saved following her medical procedure gone wrong if doctors had headed signs the comedian was going into shock, claims the investigation's report. Rivers' doctors ignored her dropping blood pressure and pulse and even failed to call 911 for 10 precious minutes as they attempted to resuscitate her once they realized she was dying, according to Page Six. Prior to that, insiders, outside experts and the findings of a federal report revealed that Drs. Lawrence Cohen and Gwen Korovin--along with Bankulla--carried on with their procedure as if nothing was wrong with Rivers. But something was wrong at Yorkville Endoscopy on August 28 and the trouble started after 9am, when Rivers was put under with normal vital signs. Fifteen minutes later, Rivers started showing signs of shock as her blood pressure  dropped to 92/54 and her pulse fell to 56. Also implicated: Insiders, outside experts and the findings of a federal report revealed that Drs. Lawrence Cohen (left) and Gwen Korovin (right)--along with Bankulla--carried on with their procedure as if nothing was wrong with Rivers as her vital signs rapidly deteriorated . 'At this point, something has gone wrong, the procedure must come to an end, and she needs to be resuscitated,' a veteran paramedic not involved in the case told the Post. The doctors failed to act when Rivers' vital signs dropped even further, reports the Post. Instead, with the 81-year-old's blood pressure at 89/44 and her pulse at 54, the doctors administered propofol--the powerful anesthetic that led to the death of Michael Jackson. 'That doesn’t make any sense,' said Page Six's paramedic. 'You’re sedating someone who’s going into shock.' Even as she began coding, with her bp at 84/40, and her pulse at 47, the examination reportedly continued. That was at 9:28am, 12 minutes after Rivers' vital signs should have first caused concern. Still, the examination continued, with just an increase to her oxygen flow. Two minutes later, the examination was stopped and records show the doctors began trying to resuscitate Rivers with life-saving drugs. They wouldn't call 911 for another ten minutes. And records indicate they did not administer CPR as they awaited the paramedics. By the time they arrived at 9:47, paramedics found Rivers' turning blue form lack of oxygen.

"Abu Qatada returned home yesterday – as a Government terror adviser warned it could be years before he is kicked out of Britain. The fanatic, who was granted bail by a court on Monday, was driven from his high-security prison and back to the family home. He smirked as he stepped out of a people carrier to face chants of 'out, out, out' from furious protesters. Scroll down to watch the video . New home: Abu Qatada (left) pictured on his return to Wembley, north London. Now it has been revealed he will be rehoused . David Cameron, on a visit to Italy, . said he was 'fed up' that Qatada was on the streets and Downing Street . said the Government would appeal against the decision to block his . deportation to Jordan. 'I'm fed up he's still at large in our . country,' the Prime Minister said. 'He has no right to be there, we . believe he is a threat to our country. 'We have moved heaven and earth to try . to comply with every single dot and comma of every single convention to . get him out of our country. 'It is extremely frustrating and I share the British people's frustration with the situation we find ourselves in.' But he did not respond to calls from . Tory backbenchers who want Britain to withdraw from the European Court . of Human Rights or simply to ignore Strasbourg's ruling in the case. In the House of Commons, Justice . Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'All of us believe the law should not . operate in this way and this case underlines my view that there is a . very real need for major changes to the way the European human rights . framework operates.' Welcome home: Abu Qatada (left) gets out of the rear of a vehicle as he returns to his residence in London . Hello: Abu Qatada (centre) arrives at his home in London in front of the media after being released from prison . Protesters at Abu Qatada's home holding a message for him . Front-door: Abu Qatada returned home this week after his second period of time in prison. Housing benefit is understood to cover his current rent of £1,900 a month . David Anderson QC, the Home Office's . Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, told the BBC: 'It's a . very frustrating episode for all concerned but as far as I can see this . is not the end of the road.' He said the key to the case lies in Jordan, which must change its criminal code to stop evidence obtained by torture being used. Mr Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa . May are expected to hold talks on Qatada with Jordan's King Abdullah II . when he visits London next week. A Jordanian minister said  yesterday the country would be 'co-ordinating closely' with  Britain over the next steps in the case. But, even if there is agreement, the case would go through the British courts again and could even return to Strasbourg. Mr Anderson said: 'We could be looking at months, we could be looking at a very few years.' Smiling Qatada was driven out of . high-security Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire just before 11.30am . in a Mercedes people carrier. When the Islamist – once described as . Osama Bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe – arrived home in Wembley he . was greeted by protesters. They held up a 'Get rid of Abu Qatada' banner and shouted 'Get him out!' as he walked indoors. Ex-soldier Aaron Baker, 31, who led . the protest, said: 'I think it's disgusting he's still here. It's scary. I've got two young children who go to school round here.' Another protester, Anthony Mellish, 19, added: 'It's a peaceful area. We don't need a terrorist here.' Qatada's release was ordered by a . special immigration court which ruled on Monday that sending him back to . Jordan to face terror charges would breach his human rights.  He will . be allowed out between 8am and 4pm and be monitored by the police and . MI5 at a cost of £100,000 a week. Under his bail conditions, he is . banned from using the internet, owning a mobile phone or meeting anyone . on a list of individuals. He also cannot lead prayers, give lectures, preach or provide religious instruction other than to his wife and children at home. The court's ruling was based on a Strasbourg judgment that he could be prosecuted on the basis of evidence obtained by torture. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg urged the . Government to follow Henry VIII's ruling that it was high treason to . appeal to a court outside his kingdom. He said: 'Has not the time come . for this Parliament to legislate to prohibit appeals to foreign courts . and to prohibit the judgments of foreign courts leading our judiciary?' Qatada featured in hate sermons found on videos in the flat of one of the September 11 bombers. Mr Justice Mitting . He has been a High Court judge since 2001 and head of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission – the court which freed Qatada – since 2007.Cambridge-educated, he became a QC in 1987. In May 2010 the 64-year-old judge  ruled that two Pakistani students who posed a significant threat to national security could not be sent home.He said he was satisfied that Abid Naseer was an Al Qaeda operative and that his friend Ahmed Faraz Khan planned an attack on Britain. However he ruled that they faced illegal detention, torture and ill-treatment if returned. In 2010 he ruled hook-handed fanatic Abu Hamza could keep his UK passport, because taking it away would breach his human rights.Judge Peter Lane . He was criticised in 2010 for overturning a decision to deport a foreign student caught working illegally.The Ghanaian student, 29, at the University of Sunderland was found working as a security guard for longer than the permitted 20 hours a week, and as a result the Home Office refused to allow him to stay in Britain.

"Princess Beatrice was spotted stepping out for a stroll with her long-term boyfriend, Dave Clark, in St Barts. The couple, who have been dating for more than six years, looked relaxed as they walked along the waterfront of the Caribbean island, where they have been enjoying some winter sun. The sighting comes after it emerged that Beatrice's father, Prince Andrew, will fly back from his skiing holiday in Verbier today to tell the Queen that he did not have sex with underage girls. Scroll down for video . Relaxed: Princess Beatrice was spotted strolling along the St Barts waterfront with boyfriend Dave Clark . Stylish: The royal, pictured with Mr Clark, added a splash of colour to her outfit with a vibrant bucket bag . Princess Beatrice, 26, looked slim and stylish in a simple white dress and matching panama hat. A blue bucket bag with a vibrant design added a bold splash of colour to the summery ensemble. Mr Clark, a Virgin Galactic executive, looked just as casual in long shorts and trainers - paired with a relaxed blue-grey shirt. The 31-year-old also sported a fashionable pair of sunglasses. Prince Andrew will today return for a summit with his mother amid allegations he used a 17-year-old 'sex slave' and had an orgy with girls while they were minors. The Prince had been skiing last week in the Swiss resort of Verbier with his former wife Sarah Ferguson, daughter Princess Eugenie and her friend Cressida Bonas. Princess Eugenie, 24, was photographed yesterday as she returned to the snow-covered chalet with a group of friends including Miss Bonas - Prince Harry's former flame. It emerged today that the Prince may have immunity from prosecution for his alleged involvement in the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein, his former friend, under a deal with the US government. Committed: Princess Beatrice, 26, has been dating 31-year-old Mr Clark for more than six years . Holiday: The young royal was photographed earlier this week as she celebrated the new year with frineds . The secret plea agreement  struck  in 2007 protects Epstein, along with his 'co-conspirators', from a number of criminal charges relating to an alleged  sex trafficking ring set up for the rich and famous. It is claimed that the 'non-prosecution' agreement was obtained by billionaire Epstein - a convicted sex offender - through his 'significant social and political connections'. Last night, the Duke of York made a robust rebuttal of allegations made by Virginia Roberts that she was forced to have sex with the royal when she was only 17 - making her a minor in Florida. Prince Andrew came out fighting against the woman, whose allegations have dogged him since a photograph of them together emerged in 2011. Low profile: Their sighting comes after it emerged that Prince Andrew was flying back to the UK from skiing . A Buckingham Palace spokesman said in a statement to The Mail on Sunday: 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. 'Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.' The denial was more emphatic than a previous one issued, which said that 'any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue'. Earlier this week, Princess Beatrice was photographed sipping champagne on a yacht off the Caribbean island as she welcomed the new year with friends. She and Mr Clark are often spotted enjoying romantic evenings out at some of London's most exclusive dining venues - including celebrity hotspot the Chiltern Firehouse.

"The tearful father of an Irish tourist who was charged over a one-punch attack on his younger brother said his sons have loved each other since they were children. Barry Lyttle, 33, was granted bail at Sydney Central Court on Monday after he allegedly punched his younger brother Patrick, 31, at about 3am on Saturday in the Kings Cross nightclub district. He was reunited with his father, Oliver Lyttle, outside court while his younger brother remained in a stable but critical condition at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney’s inner east. His father, Oliver Lyttle, 74, appeared distraught and red-faced as Barry emerged from custody, wearing a blue jumper and his face unshaven. The pair wrapped each other in a tight hug before driving away, believed for St Vincent's Hospital where Patrick is being treated. 'They've loved each other since they were kids,' Mr Lyttle said. 'I want to thank St Vincent's Hospital for everything that they have done.

As part of his bail conditions, Barry has to hand over his Irish passport to authorities and is not allowed to approach his brother within 12 hours of consuming alcohol. He will also live with his Australian aunty at a Blacktown address and he will have to report to Blacktown Police Station each day. Mr Lyttle’s lawyer Christopher Watson argued Barry should only have to report to the police station weekly as he wanted to spend time with his wounded brother, but the Magistrate denied this request. His family will also have to cough up a $2,000 surety and he will face Downing Centre Local court on January 20. Barry and his father Oliver arrived in Australia on December 29 to visit Patrick, who arrived in Sydney for an Australian-wide trip last June. The siblings from Belfast in Ireland had been dining with their father earlier in the evening before the two young men went to a bar for a drink.

Paramedics treated Patrick at the scene before taking him to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery. Police have described the incident as a 'family tragedy' and Detective Superintendent Michael Fitzgerald said the 'pain in their father's eyes was indescribable'. The incident was caught on CCTV cameras and Barry reportedly screamed in shock and distress when he realised the extent of his brother's injuries. Alcohol was not a factor in the fight with Barry's blood alcohol concentration reading in the low range. The fight was said to have occurred after a minor argument.

"Pope Francis has named 15 cardinals from countries across the globe, including nations in the developing world. Cardinals have been appointed from Ethiopia, Tonga and Cape Verde as well as Vietnam and Sicily - reflecting the diversity of the church. Pope Francis told a crowd gathered in St Peter's Square that the church leaders come 'from every continent' and 'show the indelible tie with the church of Rome to churches in the world'. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis has named 15 new cardinals who hail from across the world and developing countries . The 15 cardinals, who hail from a total 14 nations, are all under 80 and will therefore be able to vote for the Pope's successor. He also made a surprise announcement and said he would lead a meeting of all cardinals to 'reflect on the orientations and proposals for the reform of the Roman Curia', the Vatican's administrative bureaucracy, between February 12 and 13. Since he took on the role, Pope Francis has remained committed to root out corruption and inefficiency from the curia. Among those elected were Francesco Montenegro, the archbishop of Agrigento in Sicily, and head of the Italian bishops' group that deals with migration. Dominique Mamberti, who heads the Apostolic Signatura, the Vatican's highest court, was the only member of the curia, the central administration of the Holy See which governs the 1.2-billion strong Catholic Church, to be elevated to the post. It is the second time Pope Francis has not appointed any Americans to the role. As well as the 15 cardinals, Pope Francis also appointed five bishops and archbishops who are too old to take part in future votes for the next pope. Cardinals were appointed from Ethiopia, Tonga and Burma by the Pope as he announced a February meeting . Francis is the first Latin American pope and never worked in the Italian-dominated Curia before he was elected. He has not shied from complaining about the gossiping, careerism and bureaucratic power intrigues that afflict the Holy See. At Christmas he delivered his message to the Curia and highlighted the '15 Ailments of the Curia', which included a desire for power and hypocrisy. In January last year he sacked four of five cardinals who sat on a panel that oversees the Vatican Bank. The Vatican bank was caught in a money-laundering row in 2010 after Italian prosecutors uncovered allegedly suspicious financial activity within the organisation.

"Prisoners using mobile phones from behind bars will be cut off under plans to stop them running their criminal empires from their cells. Ministers are to compel phone firms to act by law to disconnect the mobile numbers of handsets used in jails across the country. It follows a warning from Home Secretary Theresa May that 7,000 known organised criminals are housed in jails, co-ordinating illegal activity in the outside world. Prisons will use new, cheaper technology to detect where mobile phones are being used and record their numbers, before getting a court judgement forcing mobile firms to disconnect them . There were 7,451 mobile phones and SIM cards seized in 2013, according to latest figures. However, they are likely to have been replaced by hundreds more smuggled in by visitors and possibly corrupt prison staff. Mobile phone companies had previously insisted they would not act voluntarily and would require a change in the law to disconnect numbers tracked by prison officers. A memo written by Mrs May said: 'There are over 7,000 known organised criminals in prison in England and Wales. 'We know of cases of serious crimes including large drug imports, escapes and murders being organised from prison, enabled by illicit mobile phones,' the Sunday Times reported. Being caught using a mobile phone in prison carries a sentence of up to two more years in jail and an unlimited fine. Mrs May's memo added: 'The mobile network operators have told us they are unwilling to disconnect these phones unless compelled by law.' For the last three years prison governors have been able to use specialist equipment to block or scramble phone signals to stop them being used by criminals. But there have been complaints that installing the technology across all prisons would be 'prohibitively expensive'. The National Offender Management Service estimates it would cost £300million to install the devices at every prison, with operating costs of £800,000 a year. There were 7,451 mobile phones and SIM cards seized in 2013, according to latest figures (file image) However, acting to disconnect specific numbers of illicit phones will cost around £300,000, with mobile firms £212,000 worse off. Details of new powers will be unveiled tomorrow by ministers who insist it will 'significantly increase' their ability to tackle the problem. Prisons will use new, cheaper technology to detect where mobile phones are being used and record their numbers. Governors could then go to a county court with all the numbers from each prison and young offenders' institution and obtain a blacklisting order from the court. It would mean there would be no need to find and seize the actual handsets from prisoners. Prisons minister Andrew Selous said: 'We will never tolerate the use of mobile phones in prisons. This proposed new legislation will significantly increase our ability to tackle this problem.' He added: 'By ordering a phone to be cut off once it is identified, we will be able to reassure victims and prevent further criminal activity faster and wider than ever before.'","7,451 mobile phones and SIM cards were seized in prisons in 2013 .

"Rapist: Frank Van Den Bleeken is to be put to death after a court granted him the right to euthanasia . A rapist and murderer is to be put to death in Belgium, despite the EU ban on the death penalty, after a court granted him the right to euthanasia. Frank Van Den Bleeken argued that he had no prospect of release because he cannot overcome his violent sexual impulses and wants to end years of mental anguish. Van Den Bleeken, 51, will commit medically assisted suicide at a prison in Bruges this week. A spokesman for Belgian justice minister Koen Geens told the newspaper De Morgen: ‘Euthanasia will indeed be implemented. The time has come.’ The ruling by the justice ministry allowing the death was the first involving a prisoner since the country’s euthanasia law was introduced 13 years ago. Van Den Bleeken, who has been in prison for nearly 30 years, said he preferred to die because there was no therapy for his condition in Belgium. The country is not the only one in Europe to provide a right to die but it has pioneered the use of the law beyond the terminally ill. Among cases that hit the headlines were those of deaf twins who were losing their sight, and a transgender patient left in torment by an unsuccessful sex-change. Jail: Van Den Bleeken, 51, will commit medically assisted suicide at a prison in Bruges (above) this week . It is also the first country to allow euthanasia for terminally ill children at any age. Belgium legalised euthanasia in 2002, the second country in the world to do so after the Netherlands, and logged a record 1,807 cases of euthanasia in 2013. Its strict conditions for a mercy killing include that patients must be capable, conscious and have presented a 'voluntary, considered and repeated' request to die.","Frank Van Den Bleeken wants to end years of mental anguish .

"Luke Foley has been elected unopposed as leader of the NSW Labor Party. It was a result which was widely expected after Mr Foley's main rival for the leadership, Shadow Treasurer Michael Daley, pulled out of the running last week when the ALP head office threw its support behind Mr Foley. Mr Foley, who is Shadow Environment and Planning Minister, replaces John Robertson as Opposition Leader who quit after admitting to have signed a letter on behalf of Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis, as his local MP, back in 2011. Luke Foley has taken over the hot-seat as ALP leader in New South Wales after John Robertson's recent shock resignation . John Robertson stepped down as NSW Opposition Leader and leader of his party in the state after revelations he had signed a letter for Sydney siege suspect Man Haron Monis as his local MP, some three years before the tragic events which led to the death of two hostages and brought the city to a standstill . The government has already accused Mr Foley as being a representative of 'the faceless men' of the Australian Labor Party. State Treasurer Andrew Constance claims 'Luke Fole,  a former union boss, a former Labor Party official, has been installed by the faceless men of Labor's head office'. 'One minute, Michael Daley is telling everyone this is coming down to the wire and there would be a ballot, a day later he has pulled out. 'A further example that Labor's head office runs the show and that democracy is dead within the Labor caucus when Labor Party members aren't even given the ability to determine their leader.' John Robertson was forced to reveal how he once helped the Sydney siege gunman plea for access to his children on Father’s Day. Mr Robertson signed a letter to the Department of Family and Community Services on behalf of Man Haron Monis, a constituent in his western Sydney electorate of Blacktown, in 2011. He said that he'd 'made a conscious decision that my office would be there to serve everyone in the Blacktown community. However I accept how this may appear given recent events'. Monis notoriously kept 18 terrified people hostage, shooting two dead, during a near 17-hour siege in the Lindt café in Sydney’s Martin Place. Mr Robertson has admitted to having assisted Monis when he was seeking visitation rights for his two children from his ex-wife Noleen Hayson Pal. Mr Foley was the only nominee for the party's leadership and was elected unopposed. Linda Burney will continue to serve as deputy leader. NSW is due to go to the polls in March, with the Mike Baird-led coalition, which itself has been crippled by ICAC-driven resignations, still heavily favoured to be returned. Mr Foley, who is Shadow Environment and Planning Minister, replaces John Robertson as Opposition Leader who quit after admitting to have signed a letter on behalf of Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis, as his local MP, back in 2011 . Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis, was shot dead after taking hostages at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Martin Place last month. Two other people died, 33-year-old cafe manager Tori Johnson and 38-year-old Sydney barrister Katrina Dawson . People from the Lindt Cafe, Martin Place during a hostage stand-off on December 16 in Sydney. Police stormed the cafe after Man Haron Monis had gunned down one of those held inside. Former NSW Opposition Leader John Robertson resigned over a letter he'd signed for the gunman three years earlier . Mr Foley, 44, will now try to switch from the upper house of parliament to the lower house. He's expected to push to become the ALP's candidate for the western Sydney seat of Auburn, held by Labor's Barbara Perry. Mr Foley is from the party's left faction and a devoted Catholic who opposes gay marriage. 'I assume the leadership of the NSW Labor party with great pride and humility,' he said. Mr Foley is married with three children - Aoife, Niamh and Patrick.

"Russell Brand launched a foul-mouthed attack on Labour's Ed Balls on television, branding him a 'clicky-wristed snidey c***'. The outspoken left-wing comedian hit out at the shadow chancellor during Channel 4's Big Fat Anniversary Quiz. And he warned Mr Balls and former Prime Minister Tony Blair that they faced a tough time when his planned revolution overthrows the political establishment. Scroll down for video . Comedian Russell Brand tore into Labour's Ed Balls on the Channel 4 show, The Big Fat Anniversary Quiz . Teammate Noel Fielding seemed visibly shocked after Brand called Mr Balls a ''clicky-wristed snidey c***'. Brand was appearing on the show alongside other comedians including Noel Fielding, Jonathan Ross, Jack Whitehall and Claudia Winkleman. It included questions about the last 10 years, and in one round teams were asked about an infamous tweet which Balls sent which simply stated: 'Ed Balls.' Between questions Whitehall asked Brand about the Labour MP's prospects if he gets his way and overthrows democracy. Whitehall asked: 'Ed Balls, Russell, after the revolution?' Brand replied: 'I think it's gonna be a tough time for Ed Balls.' He went on: 'I shook his hand once. All clicky wristed, he was a snidey c***.' Fellow guests including Whitehall and Winkleman appeared visible shocked by the foul-mouthed slur. The remark came after Jack Whitehall, pictured with Claudia Winkleman, asked Brand if Mr Balls would survive his planned revolution . The quiz, hosted by Jimmy Carr, had asked what Mr Balls had tweeted in 2011 which had been retweeted thousands of times . Referring to Brand's confrontation last year with Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman, Whitehall added: 'Why didn't you say that in the Paxman interview?' Host Jimmy Carr said 'all clicky wrists' sounded like something from dystopian crime drama A Clockwork Orange. Brand went on, inspired by the film's Nadsat slang: 'All clickly wrist he were, real horror show. Me and my droogies done him in. Did him good it did as he spilt his claret like silvery wine.' Whitheall, appearing baffled, responded: 'It sounds wonderful but I am going to have to have it Google translated to posh.' The question in the quiz related to the tweet posted by Mr Balls on April 28 2011 which just said: 'Ed Bals.' In April 2011 Mr Balls posted just 'Ed Balls', which sparked a Twitter frenzy and led to April 28 being named Ed Balls Day . A spokesman for Mr Balls declined to comment on Brand's foul-mouthed attack . It has since been retweeted more than 30,000 times. As Carr gave the answer to the question, Brand responded: 'What a prick, clicky wrist prick.' Earlier in the show Brand suggested Mr Blair would also be in trouble when his revolution came. He has argued that there is little point in voting and insisted 'profit' is a dirty word. In 2013 Brand launched similar verbal assault on David Cameron, calling the Tory Prime Minister a 'w*****'. He told Alan Carr's Chatty Man: 'If you're always cutting benefits and being horrible, it's because you don't know how to f*** properly. 'I think if your job is to look after the country and you don't care about the people who need it most, you're out of order, and you're a filthy, dirty, posh w*****.' A spokesman for Mr Balls declined to comment.","Comedian launches attack on shadow chancellor during Channel 4 show .

"Seizures of methamphetamine soared at the US-Mexico border during fiscal year 2014. Meth seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection's San Diego field office accounted for 63 percent of all meth seized at land, air and sea entry points nationwide. That amounts to a whopping 14,732 pounds of the drug seized just in San Diego through the end of September. Seizures of methamphetamine (not pictured) soared at the US-Mexico border in the past year, with San Diego as its main hub . 'The Mexican cartels are flooding the U.S. marketplace with their cheap methamphetamine,' Gary Hill, DEA assistant special agent in charge in San Diego, told the San Diego Union-Tribune. Almost all meth used to be produced in the United States and San Diego was a production hub. But the U.S. cracked down with laws limiting access to the synthetic ingredients, and now it's cheaper and easier to make it in Mexico. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that 90 percent of meth in United States now comes from Mexico. Drug cartels find it cheaper to make meth than smuggle cocaine from South America. 'The overhead is tremendous for cocaine,' Hill told the Union-Tribune. But for meth, he added, 'the overhead is minimal. 'They oversee the manufacturing. There is no middleman.' Production is mostly controlled by the violent Sinaloa cartel and Knights Templar, which also control smuggling routes along the California border, the newspaper reported. 'That's our supposition,' Hill said. 'They control the gateway at San Diego and they seem to be the ones who are most involved in manufacturing the methamphetamine, so it kind of goes hand-in-hand.' The 2014 fiscal year ended Sept. 30. This is just a part of the 14,732 pounds of methamphetamine seized in San Diego through the end of September .","Seizures of meth along the US-Mexico border soared in the last year .

"Patrol: Nearly 7,500 phones were seized in prisons in England and Wales in 2013 (stock image) Mobile phones being used by prisoners will be cut off under tough new laws. Operators will be forced to block any number traced to an inmate following a number of cases where offenders have stalked victims and witnesses on social media and boasted about their cushy time behind bars. Prison guards seize around 130 mobiles every week which are frequently used to run rackets inside from drug smuggling to contract killings. Use of a mobile phone behind bars is already punishable with a sentence of up to two more years in jail and an unlimited fine, but around 7,000 criminals still use them inside. The most recent figures available show that a total of 7,451 illicit mobile phones were seized in prisons in England and Wales in 2013. Since 2012 prison governors have had the power to interfere with mobile phone signals to thwart crime bosses operating there by phone. However the National Offender Management Service estimates it would cost £300million to install the devices at every prison, with operating costs of £800,000 a year. But under the proposed new legislation to be debated in the Commons today,  once a prisoner’s phone signal has been identified, the Prison Service will be able to apply to a court for it to be disconnected without guards having to find the device itself. A memo written by Theresa May, the home secretary, leaked to The Sunday Times, says: ‘There are over 7,000 known organised criminals in prison in England and Wales. 'We know of cases of serious crimes including large drug imports, escapes and murders being organised from prison, enabled by illicit mobile phones. ‘The mobile network operators have told us they are unwilling to disconnect these phones unless compelled by law.’ Ministers estimate the cost of blocking illicit phones and Sim cards will be up to £300,000, with the cost to the mobile firms of up to £212,000. It will not be necessary to seize the phone or prove that it is being used by a specific prisoner, speeding up the enforcement of the ban on using mobiles behind bars. Under the plans, prison security chiefs would use new but cheaper technology to detect the use of phones and their numbers. Prisons already use a range of measures to detect items of contraband with intelligence-led searches, body searches and the use of x-ray machines, metal detectors and CCTV surveillance cameras, as well as body orifice scanners. Smuggled in: Prison guards seize around 130 mobiles every week which are frequently used to run rackets inside from drug smuggling to contract killings (stock image) But now they will be able to go to a county court with all the numbers from each prison and young offenders' institution and obtain a blacklisting order from the court. There would be no need for prison officers to find and seize the phones from prisoners who have sophisticated means of concealing their use. Ministers will table an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill to introduce the measure when it is discussed in Parliament tomorrow. It follows dozens of cases where inmates have used their smartphones to upload messages and pictures from inside their cells showing their cushy prison lifestyle with access to TVs, gaming consoles and junk food. In November last year a thug serving a 10-year sentence for stabbing his sister's ex-boyfriend and leaving him for dead boasted about his ‘f****** blinding’ time behind bars. Joe Bath, 27, from Margate, Kent, was stabbed in the face and beaten so badly that his mother didn’t even recognise him in hospital. But his attacker Lee Cekic continued to torment his victim from his prison cell, bragging on Facebook that it was ‘all worth it’. Yesterday Andrew Selous, the prisons minister, said: ‘We will never tolerate the use of mobile phones in prisons. This proposed new legislation will significantly increase our ability to tackle this problem. ‘By ordering a phone to be cut off once it is identified, we will be able to reassure victims and prevent further criminal activity faster and wider than ever before.’","Use of a mobile can land a prisoner with an additional two years in jail .

"Children barely old enough to walk have been questioned by police over an astonishing range of crimes – including rape, theft, assault and vandalism. Official crime statistics reveal how suspects as young as two years old were picked up by police officers. Police also quizzed a four-year-old accused of rape in London, a five year-old for the same crime in Surrey, a five-year-old on suspicion of incest in Cheshire and two three-year-olds for sexual offences in Durham. The crimes apparently committed by children too young for primary school are among more than 5,000 offences by youngsters aged eight and younger. Scroll down for video . Crimes by children aged 8 and under reached a four-year high in 2014 - some were as young as two years old . 2011 - 1,467 . 2012 - 1,343 . 2013 - 1,142 . 2014 - 1,713 . Total - 5,665 . Overall, the figures from 34 of the 45 forces in the United Kingdom collated under the Freedom of Information Act, show that 5,665 crimes were committed by children under eight in the last four years. Alarmingly, crimes reached a four-year high in 2014, with 1,713 recorded. Offences included fire-raising, possession of drugs, violence and causing racially or religiously aggravated public fear. This also comes in the wake of revelations that a total of 154 children aged 12 and under were arrested for sex crimes, including rape and sexual assault. At present, the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is 10, which means there is nothing police can do. Some campaigners want to raise the age of criminal responsibility from ten to 14 but if that proposal were implemented it would mean children such as Robert Thompson and Jon Venables – who killed toddler James Bulger when they were ten – would not have to face court. Laurence Lee, 61, who represented 10-year-old Venables in 1993, has now suggested the age of criminal responsibility be lowered to combat the rising rate of children crime. He told MailOnline: 'I think there is a growing case to lower the age of criminal responsibility as children crime is increasing. Laurence Lee, who represented Jon Venables in 1993, wants the age of criminal responsibility lowered . 'Teenagers recruit young children to commit crime for them as they know they cannot be prosecuted. 'The other problem is the rise of social networking means young children are more aware of what is going on in the world. 'The age rate should be lowered. As a criminal lawyer, I sit in court and see what goes on in society. Youths are much savvier than they have ever been. That is down to parental upbringing and because schools cannot deal with children as they should. It is a problem that is getting worse.' As the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is set at 10, there is nothing the police can do . Children under 10 cannot be charged with committing a criminal offence. However, they can be given a Local Child Curfew or a Child Safety Order. Children under 10 who break the law regularly can sometimes be taken into care, or their parents could be held responsible. If a child is given a Local Child Curfew it can last for up to 90 days and it can see children banned from being in a public place between 9pm and 6am, unless accompanied by an adult. If a child has committed an offence or broken a Local Child Curfew, they can be placed under the supervision of a youth offending team. This is called a Child Safety Order. The order normally lasts for up to three months, but in some cases it can last for up to 12 months. If a child doesn't stick to the rules of an order, the court can consider if the child should be taken into care. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) has been warning since 1995 that the UK's threshold of 10 – set in 1963 – is incompatible with its obligations under the UN's convention on children's rights. The UNCRC wants countries to set the age of criminal responsibility at an 'absolute minimum' of 12, and aim to keep increasing it. The European average is 14, ranging from 13 in France, 14 in Germany, 15 in Denmark and Sweden, 16 in Portugal and 18 in Luxembourg. Scotland increased the age at which children can be prosecuted from eight to 12 in 2011. Children between 10 and 17 in England can be arrested and taken to court if they commit a crime. They are treated differently from adults and are dealt with by youth courts, given different sentences and sent to special secure centres for young people, not adult prisons. Of the total 5,665 recorded crimes, the vast majority were criminal damage or vandalism with 2,376, followed by shoplifting, theft and dishonesty with 1,279 and assault or acts of violence with 985. There were 35 rapes, of which 24 were in London. Disturbingly, more than half of the rapes took place in the last year with campaigners citing 'degrading and often violent pornography' as a factor for this concerning rise. Jon Brown, NSPCC lead for tacking sexual abuse, said; 'It is very worrying that thousands of children are committing crimes, and even more concerning that many of these are sexual offences including serious assaults and rape. 'Prevention has to be the key and that means recognising warning signs early and taking swift action. 'Sadly, for many children easy access to degrading and often violent pornography is now part of life, and we are concerned that this may be warping their view of what is normal or acceptable behaviour. 'When very young children, such as those of primary school age or younger, are committing these crimes, we have to question the environment in which they are growing up that has led to them behaving in this way. 'It could be that they have seen sexual activity that they are just too young to understand and are copying what they've seen.' Amanda Everitt, from the mothers against murder and aggression charity, said: 'It is a concern that these figures are rising. We must do more to identify children of such a young age who display violence. 'Interventions that are effective at changing that behaviour at the earliest possible stage need to be resourced and applied. 'Crime victims who are affected by serious crimes committed by the under 10's are often left devastated by the fact that they will not be part of the Criminal Justice System and are often left with no knowledge of how the offender is being managed following serious crimes.' Questioned on whether the age of criminal responsibility should be lowered, a Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'The Government has no plans to lower the age of criminal responsibility, which in England and Wales is currently set at the age of 10, because we believe that children under that age are unable to weigh up right and wrong in the same way that older children or adults are.'","In last four years, 5,665 crimes committed by children aged 8 and under .

"Two policemen were thrown into the air and suffered serious injuries after they were hit by a suspected drunk driver as they spoke to another motorist they had stopped. A VW Golf ploughed into the back of Mercedes, which hit the two officers from West Midlands Police who had been standing next to it. The Golf then hurtled into the pair on the A461 in Tipton, Sandwell. Both were thrown into the air by the crash, with one of the officers knocked unconscious and left with a broken leg while the other was left with serious fractures to both legs. Two police officers were thrown up into the air and left with serious leg injuries after a suspected drink driver ploughed into the car they had already stopped in Tipton, Sandwell, before careering into both the officers . The female driver of the blue Golf has been arrested on suspicion of drink driving. She had to be cut free from the wreckage of the car by firefighters and was taken to hospital with a suspected broken shoulder. The officers, both in their 40s, had served in the force for 11 and 13 years, and were given emergency first aid by colleagues at the scene in Tipton before specially trained firearms officers arrived. The crash took place at about 1.30am today. Chief Inspector Jack Hadley, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Despite their serious injuries, this crash could have been much worse for all concerned. 'The officers were initially treated by colleagues before firearms officers - who have advanced life-saving skills - arrived to provide major trauma care. Dudley Port was closed for 4 hours after the crash . 'Paramedics then took over sending three ambulances and three doctors to the scene. 'I would urge anyone who may have witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police to get in touch.' The driver of the Mercedes E350, who was initially stopped by the policemen, was not seriously injured. Dudley Port was closed for four hours while emergency services responded to the crash.

"It is a site seen as such an impressive example of landscape garden design it has been named on the World Heritage List. Usually packed with visitors during the summer, Kunming Lake is one of Beijing's best known tourist destinations. It is often used as the central stretch of water to explore the gardens and waterways of the complex Summer Palace in Beijing in China. But locals have taken advantage of the recent cold snap which has frozen the lake solid and have taken to it with carts on wheels and sledges. Dozens of tourists took sledges and carts onto Kunming Lake, part of the Summer Palace in Beijing in China, after the lake froze over . The mercury plunged to -9C  between Christmas and New Year and the freezing temperatures are forecast to continue throughout this week and during much of January. Dozens of people could be seen in carts and other contraptions to enjoy the icy conditions on Kunming Lake this weekend as temperatures reached -7C last night. Some were seen on bikes while others appeared to be on a form of sledge, armed with poles to help them slide along the icy surface. The lake is man-made and a central feature of the Summer Palace. People rowing the lake can get views of Longevity Hill and the Tower of Buddhist Incense situated there. Tourists wheeled covered carts and other contraptions onto the lake as the freezing temperatures take hold in the country . The lake froze as temperatures plunged to -9C this week and reached around -7C yesterday as people prepare for the cold snap this month . China traditionally marks the long winter period of cold weather with the Harbin Ice and Snow Festival held at sites throughout Beijing . The palace covers 2.9 square kilometres, or 490 acres, and is made up of three quarters of water - in which Kunming Lake is the central feature. Hills and water are combined with bridges, halls, palaces and temples to make up the site and it is usually flooded with visitors every summer. Lake Kunming is a popular cruising and rowing location. And yesterday locals took to explore it on sledges and carts on wheels, as they raced around the icy stretches. The Summer Palace, made up of three quarters of water, is dominated by Kunming Lake and the impressive views of Longevity Hill . Temperatures rarely reach above 0C in China during January and February, and the number of people on Kunming Lake could be a fitting start to the annual Harbin Ice and Snow festival held in Beijing. Harbin Ice and Snow festival began in 1963 and officially begins tomorrow on January 5. Kunming Lake used to a reservoir and was converted into an imperial garden under the rule of Qianlong Emperor between 1750 and 1764. It remains shallow but was widened to create the Summer Palace. The palace was included on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1998 and was declared ' 'a masterpiece of Chinese landscape garden design.'","Tourists have been seen in carts with wheels and sledges with sticks on frozen Kunming Lake in Beijing in China .

"When Ed Sheeran lets his hair down after a hard day conquering the pop world, he likes to have a few beers with old mates at his newly restored Suffolk farmhouse. But woe betide any friend who places his bottle down on a table, for the 23-year-old singer-songwriter will be sure to place a coaster quickly underneath to prevent it marking the surface. ‘I love cleaning, that’s my thing. I really like making the house perfect,’ says Sheeran, who claims he’s so house-proud that he frets if more than five people visit at once. Scroll down for video . Unreal scenes: Ed Sheeran with Taylor Swift and Victoria's Secret models on stage at the underwear brand's annual Fashion Show in London last month . It’s fair to say that models lounging in baths full of champagne are probably out of the question. Rock ’n’ roll? More like Shake ’n’ Vac. The spotlight swung once more on to the refreshingly unstarry but acutely business-savvy Sheeran this week as it emerged that he was 2014’s biggest-selling pop artist with his second album, X (pronounced Multiply). In Britain alone, it sold 1.7 million copies and, around the world, it has been played 430 million times on the online music provider Spotify. He has been hailed as Britain’s biggest cultural export since ITV’s Downton Abbey and in some ways he is just as reassuringly cosy as the costume drama. Here is a regular nice guy whose scruffy image, understated manner and proud housekeeping skills couldn’t be further from the showbusiness cliches. His songs are simple, almost uniquely combining folk and rap. He fills stadiums and yet performs unaccompanied with his acoustic guitar. Thatcherite background? Ed Sheeran grew up in a middle-class family in Suffolk . We don’t yet know his political views — he’s far too self-effacing to foist those on us. But at the risk of ruining his credibility, it has to be said that, in many ways, Sheeran is the perfect Thatcherite pop star. The product of a supportive, middle-class English family, he has pulled himself up through talent and sheer bloody-minded hard work. You could hardly accuse Sheeran of riding the usual image-obsessed route to pop stardom. He’s sweet-looking rather than handsome — he boasts an unruly mop of ginger hair, an unconvincing beard and a student wardrobe. On stage without his guitar, he looks like a fan who’s just jumped up there. But this ordinariness, say music industry insiders, is the secret to his success. Young fans can relate to Sheeran in a way they cannot to other, far more glamorous, stars. Similarly, his songs touch on everyday themes such as the torment of young lovers who must part when they go to different universities. It’s not surprising he writes about ordinary, middle-class life, as that is exactly where Sheeran comes from. He grew up in the Suffolk market town of Framlingham. His father is an art historian and his mother a jewellery maker. Both ardent music lovers, they introduced him to classic Sixties and Seventies artists. The young Sheeran says he was inspired to take up the guitar after seeing Eric Clapton in concert. Unfocused at school, he was 14 when he released his first recording. At 17, he persuaded his parents to let him leave school and move to London to follow his passion. His father, John, supportively cut out newspaper interviews with singer-songwriters, highlighting quotes he thought would help his son fulfil his dream. ‘I didn’t have a Plan B. This was it,’ Sheeran said in an interview just before Christmas. ‘My dad said: “If you really want to do it, don’t have a fall-back plan. Because you eventually will do it if there’s no other option.” ’ Sound advice, but life certainly wasn’t easy in those early years. In his first year in London in 2008, his rent was covered by a £400-a-month grant while he took a music course. When the money ran out, he would doss down on sofas and even spent a couple of nights under an arch outside Buckingham Palace. He would play wherever and whenever he could, busking around the London Underground and accepting payment for gigs in pubs in the form of food and beer. The following year, 2009, he played an astonishing 312 gigs. Why? Because he discovered that James Morrison, a similar British song-writer who suddenly shot to fame a few years ago, succeeded after performing 200 concerts a year — and he wanted to do half as many again. But by 2010, he had got into a rut. He decided to fly to Los Angeles, even though he had just one contact — the organiser of a poetry-reading night — in the city. An early performance was seen by the actor and musician Jamie Foxx who won an Oscar for his role as singer Ray Charles in the film Ray. The pair struck up an unlikely friendship and the actor let the Suffolk lad record in his studio and stay in his Hollywood home. Even better, Foxx featured Sheeran’s songs on his satellite radio music show, The Foxxhole. Pride of Britain: Ed Sheeran, seen performing on the 2014 New Year's Eve Top of the Pops Special, has been hailed as Britain’s biggest cultural export since ITV’s Downton Abbey . This was noticed by an internet entrepreneur who plugged Sheeran on an online music channel that was popular with fans of the hip hop variant known as ‘grime’. Suddenly, Sheeran was not only attracting fans on both sides of the Atlantic, but he was also managing to become popular with both white and black audiences. He still didn’t have a record deal, however, and was putting out new recordings at his own expense. By the time, in 2011, he released No 5 Collaborations Project, a set of songs recorded with various ‘grime’ stars, the internet buzz about Sheeran was so great that it went to No. 2 in the iTunes chart, selling 7,000 copies in the first week. Sheeran explained in the Financial Times — a newspaper whose business focus seems to be right up his street — that he had refused to sign to a label in the early years, willing to gamble he could make it initially on his own and so, by waiting, demand megabucks. His patience worked handsomely as he managed to hold out until the lead single from his debut album, a deceptively upbeat ballad called The A Team about a crack-addicted prostitute, had become a huge chart hit in 2011. In the meantime he moved back to London, and when more than 1,000 fans went to see a free gig in Camden, Sheeran performed four shows to make sure everyone who wanted to could see him. After he eventually signed to the music giant Atlantic Records, Sheeran’s will to win only redoubled. The buzz at Atlantic was about how former Life Guards officer James Blunt was the hardest-working performer in the industry. Sheeran got hold of Blunt’s schedule and told his team that they would do double what Blunt did. ‘And that’s exactly what I did,’ he told the FT. ‘Because he was the hardest-working guy, I wanted to work as hard as him.’ Twice as hard in fact. As the sales and awards piled up, he toured North America in 2013 with U.S. pop idol Taylor Swift who is now a close friend, as is ex-Friends star Courteney Cox in whose Malibu home Sheeran stayed last year writing music. The career-obsessed Sheeran makes no bones about wanting to do more than just put out songs. ‘I put all my time and effort into making my music successful,’ he says. He was so determined to have the Christmas No. 1 album that he went into the offices of music chain HMV and played for company bosses so they would give his CDs a better position in their stores. It’s impressive that he has any time for romance. Although he been with girlfriend Athina Andrelos for about a year, his romantic life used to be somewhat more colourful. He famously wrote a song about a woman who cheated on him. The ex in question is believed to have been singer Ellie Goulding and the man she left him for to have been One Direction star Niall Horan. He met Athina when she was the tour manager of a band who provided his support act. She now works for Jamie Oliver but has also, Sheeran admits, put in some valuable work smartening up her boyfriend’s on-stage appearance. Still, why is he so gobsmackingly popular? Critics have always been lukewarm about him, citing bland tunes and cliched lyrics. But what do they matter when teenagers the world over regard Sheeran as ‘one of them’? And middle-aged mums and dads are also fans. What’s more, they are impressed by his relentless drive — and his apparently natural image combining the sweetly shambolic ‘boy next door’ and the hard-nosed entrepreneur who pulled himself up by his bootstraps.","Ed Sheeran is the perfect Thatcherite pop star,' writes TOM LEONARD .

"The last six years of Katie Piper's life have been a triumph of strength by anyone's standards - in 2008, the former model suffered terrible burns after her ex-boyfriend, Daniel Lynch arranged to have sulfuric acid thrown in her face. Katie's injuries were so severe that she was expected to die and she was left with permanent scarring, but instead of letting the incident defeat her, she turned the experience into a positive by becoming a role model for women who have experienced domestic violence. She is now a successful writer and TV presenter and a regular at premieres and awards ceremonies.

But while the star is keen to have her daughter feature heavily in her wedding, she has decided against ever featuring Belle in any of her television work. Katie admits that she is still extremely affected by the 2008 attack and is wary of being approached by fans on the street. The experience has also made her reluctant about exposing her child to the spotlight. She said: 'I'm famous in the first instance for being attacked. 'After she was born people did tweet me horrible things like 'she is as ugly as her mum' and I don't want her to have that when she goes to school.'

She has previously described their first phone call as 'nervous and stilted' but said she soon started to relax and spent a lot of time telling each other about their jobs. The pair then arranged to meet up for a drink and a trip to the cinema. She said of the event: 'I figured that if he did turn out to be a starer, at least going to the cinema would keep his eyes elsewhere. 'James was chatty, witty and looked me squarely in the eye. He never once mentioned my burns, and because he didn’t, I didn’t either. 'He didn’t even stare at them, so I didn’t feel self-conscious.

"Better late than never: A script for The Simpsons written 25 years ago by Judd Apatow (pictured) is finally being made into an episode, which will air next week . Next week's episode of The Simpsons is one of the show's oldest, but it's not a re-run. Judd Apatow wrote the script 25 years ago, when he was a struggling stand-up comic hoping to break out as a TV writer. While the spec script was rejected at the time, Apatow went on to create his own TV show Freaks and Geeks and then achieve wide-spread success on the big screen with hit comedies like The 40-year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. The episode is finally being made a reality after a Simpsons producer heard an interview in which Apatow talked about writing the spec script, and how it influenced his later work. The script was written in 1990 when then 22-year-old Apatow was working as a stand-up comic, and writing spec scripts on the side with hopes of transitioning to a job in TV. The Simpsons was in its first season at the time, with only six episodes for Apatow to study in order to copy the comedic style. The episode, titled 'Bart's New Friend', follows Simpsons patriarch Homer being hypnotized into thinking he is 10 years old. He befriends his own son and then doesn't want to go back to being an adult. Basically the opposite of the 1988 Tom Hanks movie Big. Simpsons' producer Al Jean finally green-lighted the script when he heard Apatow mention the long-lost episode in a public interview at the L.A. County Museum. In the interview, Apatow goes on the explain how all of his work since then has basically been inspired by that episode, and it's theme of clinging to childhood. Scroll down for video . The long-lost script: The episode follows Simpsons patriarch Homer (left), who is hypnotized into thinking he is 10 years old. He befriends his son Bart (right) and then doesn't want to go back to being an adult. Apatow wrote the script in 1990, when he was just 22 years old and struggling stand-up comic . Hit maker: Apatow has since reached wide-spread fame by writing popular comedies like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. He is also an executive producer and writer on the HBO TV show Girls . 'I have always been fascinated with how difficult it is to grow up. In fact, everything I've done on film and TV is pretty much based on my Simpsons idea. I can't shake it,' Apatow told TV Guide. For example, one of Apatow's biggest hits, Knocked Up, is about a slacker forced to confront adulthood after getting a one-night-stand pregnant. He is also an executive producer and writer on HBO show Girls, about a group of twenty-something women struggling to get their lives together. Luckily, Apatow saved the script, despite his wife's (actress Leslie Mann) insistence that he purge some of his old papers. However, he admits the script wasn't exactly film-ready. 'It's a pretty rough script — when I reread it I wasn't exactly glowing with pride — but Al and the staff did their magic on it. Apatow says getting to hear his script come to life at the table read 'one of the greatest days of my life'. Judd Apatow's episode airs January 11 on Fox at 8pm. The episodes comes a year after Apatow got to voice a character of himself on the iconic show.

"It's a year since Benefits Street horrified viewers on both sides of the political divide - and with another series in the pipeline, the legacy for its 'stars' remains a mixed one. Deirdre 'White Dee' Kelly was the Channel 4 show's big winner, halting welfare claims after she began charging £1,500 an hour for nightclub gigs and appeared on Celebrity Big Brother. But others fared less well after attention dwindled - including one man who was dropped by his agent and another whose deal with a millionaire entrepreneur fell through. Scroll down for video . She's walked a long street: Deirdre 'White Dee' Kelly (left in her home in Birmingham's James Turner Street) has made thousands and spoken at the Tory party conference (right) - but others were less fortunate . Throne: White Dee on Celebrity Big Brother. Reflecting on a bizarre year, her agent said: 'We approached her early on and said ""you will definitely be exploited, you already have been exploited, so here's your chance"" Their mixed experiences fuel the debate over whether the show's jobless participants - whose years on benefits prompted anger, but who critics said had been exploited - ended up better or worse off than they were before. White Dee, the most controversial resident of Birmingham's James Turner Street, capitalised heavily on her fame - and now charges £1,500 for just one hour partying with students in nightclubs. The 43-year-old prompted a furore early on when she was pictured partying in Magaluf after claiming sickness benefit for depression. But due to her earnings she no longer claims benefits, and has debated her past with everyone from Katie Hopkins to policy experts at the Conservative party conference. She was offered a reported £100,000 to appear on Celebrity Big Brother - an appearance she later took up - and has become a vocal supporter of those still on the dole. 'I have experienced some not very nice job centres,' she told the Tory conference in September. 'You do just go in, you sit down, you are looked down upon. Well-known: James Turner Street, pictured, was the unlikely star of a show dubbed 'poverty porn' by critics . The street's residents divided viewers, with some shocked at what seemed to be a defeatist attitude to work . 'They just need to understand that, just because you are on benefits does not mean that you are not a real person. 'Just because you are on benefits doesn't mean that you are not physically looking for a job.' Many of those who appeared with her on the show, however, are still looking for work despite their brief flash of fame. Stephen 'Smoggy' Smith contacted the entrepreneurs of Dragon's Den after he earned affectionate laughs for selling items for 50p door to door. Millionaire Pimlico Plumbers founder Charlie Mullins stepped in to help him raise the cash for a Birmingham discount shop which would have undercut Poundland and the 99p Store. But the pair had a high-profile falling out last May in which Mr Mullins accused Smoggy of being 'prepared to take my help and money, but never keeps his part of the bargain'. It is believed Mr Mullins' dispute was with an agent representing Smoggy, with whom he no longer works. Mr Mullins told MailOnline: 'Smoggy was waiting to get a job as a carer to try and save some money up to start his own business. As far as I know he's out of work. Cameo: Stephen 'Smoggy' Smith featured in the show when he went door to door selling items for 50p . In business: Smoggy with millionaire Charlie Mullins - but the pair later had a high-profile falling out . 'I think he's broken away now from the people who were giving him bad advice and maybe he's realised what went wrong. 'He was a great guy and he certainly had some good ideas so potentially he had a lot going for him. He could've ended up a millionaire.' Mr Mullins denied the show exploited its jobless stars or left them worse off. 'I don't believe it's the show's fault', he said. 'They weren't doing anything before so if they aren't doing anything now, nothing's changed'. Another 'star' who lost out was alcoholic James 'Fungi' Clarke, who neighbours claimed was 'bribed' with beer to appear on the show - claims Channel 4 strenuously denied. He moved to Cardiff to escape the attention but was tracked down by agent Barry Tomes, who also represents White Dee, and agreed to sign a publicity deal. Mr Tomes said: 'He was desperate for money, but he still looked really well. We met in a pub and he had just one drink and then a glass of water'. But  the pair parted ways after he sent Fungi £70 to apply for a passport so he could fly to Magaluf. The agent claimed weeks went by and still there was no passport, leading him to cancel three of Fungi's planned appearances at the holiday resort. The final straw, he claimed, came when Fungi took part in a magazine interview claiming he had a girlfriend, but the woman involved later claimed she was nothing of the sort. Others remain in limbo including Samora Roberts, who the street's residents dubbed Black Dee. She is facing trial in May after she denied charges of plotting to supply crack cocaine, diamorphine and cannabis. But some, including couple Mark Thomas and Becky Howe who had never held down full-time jobs and were briefly arrested after their TV appearance, appear to be turning their life around. The pair refused to take part in further publicity following the show have both moved away from James Turner Street. Off the radar: James 'Fungi' Clarke was tracked to Cardiff by White Dee's agent Barry Tomes, who said he looked well and signed a publicity deal with him. But their professional relationship quickly went downhill . On the up: According to today's report in The Sun, Mark Thomas and Becky Howe are off benefits (right). Samora Roberts (left), who the street's residents dubbed Black Dee, is facing trial over drugs claims in May . According to The Sun, Mark has since found a job as a labourer and the couple are no longer claiming benefits. 'They seemed to enjoy the attention at first but I think it got too much for them,' neighbour Anna Korzen, 28, told the newspaper. 'They left six months ago but didn't say where to'. Another success story is White Dee's daughter Caitlin Kelly - who is now 17 and wants a career in the police, The Sun reported. She told the newspaper: 'I want to make sure I work for a living and not depend on others, because one day they might not be there for me.' Benefits Street proved one of the most controversial TV shows of 2014, and prompted public protests when a second series began filming in Stockton-on-Tees over the summer. The first series was cleared of breaching broadcasting rules by the regulator Ofcom in June despite sparking more than 900 complaints. The show - Channel 4's most-watched in more than a year - was slammed for 'demonising' and 'misrepresenting' those on the breadline, prompting Parliamentary debates and local meetings. The vast majority of complaints - 887 - were about the way those on benefits were portrayed and fears it was being used as 'poverty porn'. Some 23 viewers also raised fears about children and young people featured in the show, and the care which was given by programme makers for their welfare and dignity. But Ofcom ruled the show  was clearly a portrayal of one street and not wider society. Reflecting on his clients' unusual year, Mr Tomes told MailOnline: 'In everybody's defence in the street, they never applied to go on this. It wasn't Big Brother or a talent show or Come Dine With Me. 'None of them had any of these aspirations whatsoever but these opportunities came down the street once it became famous. I think even Dee is still bemused. 'I guess Dee was fortunate. We approached her early on and said ""you will definitely be exploited, you already have been exploited, so here's your chance"". 'She could have let it disappear, and many on the street have done that. I offered Mark Thomas work in the beginning in Magaluf and he wasn't interested in doing anything. 'When people ask if it's ethically messed up, I think society is messed up. In the digital age the sort of thing that used to just be gossip down the pub is now a national talking point. All I can do as a businessman is say ""there is a value here"".'","C4 show last January prompted horror and 900 'poverty porn' complaints .

The newspaper reported that Lawson said yes last week to a deal to dismiss both his fare-beating and resisting arrest charges - provided he stays out of trouble during the next six months.

"Prince Andrew is expected to hold crisis talks with the Queen today as he returned to Britain after a luxury holiday amid the growing furore over claims he had sex with an under-age girl. The Duke of York last night appeared in public for the first time since he was accused of abusing the girl ‘procured’ for him by his close friend and convicted paedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. The prince – who looked sombre as he left his luxury £22,000-a-week Swiss ski chalet yesterday – is today expected to meet with his most senior aides and lawyers in his mansion close to Windsor Castle. It is also understood he will reassure his mother at the earliest possible opportunity that the claims he faces are false. The extraordinary allegation was made by Virginia Roberts as part of a US civil case against shamed billionaire Epstein. She claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 – a minor under US law – and employed as a ‘sex slave’ by Epstein. Scroll down for video . Solemn: Fellow skiers watch as Prince Andrew leaves his £22k-a-week Swiss chalet yesterday, bound for Britain . Retreat: The royal, above, did not leave the chalet for the last two days of his holiday after the scandal broke . Returning home: His youngest daughter, Princess Eugenie, left, had been staying with him at the chalet . The fifth in line to the throne slept with Miss Roberts at an orgy with other under-age girls on Epstein’s private Caribbean island, as well as in a private house in London and in Epstein’s New York mansion, according to the court papers. Last night her father said Prince Andrew should be prosecuted if the claims were true. Sky Roberts, 58, also claimed his daughter Virginia had been introduced to the Queen while visiting London with billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein. The sexual allegations were robustly denied by Buckingham Palace in an unprecedented three public statements, which describe them as ‘false and without foundation’. A spokesman also insisted about allegations about meeting the Queen last night: 'There is nothing to suggest the claim is true. We have no record of such a meeting.' But the scandal has showed no sign of abating. Sources close to the prince admitted he had been ‘guilty of a poor choice of friend’, with one saying: ‘I don’t think anyone, not even the duke himself, would defend that friendship.’ There were also questions last night over the extraordinary legal deal that it is thought to have resulted in Prince Andrew – as well as other associates of Epstein – having immunity from any future prosecution. According to a former Florida state attorney, the controversial deal was struck amid an astonishing and aggressive campaign by Epstein’s lawyers to defend their client against claims of depraved activities. Facing the music: Pursing his lips pensively, Prince Andrew walked to his car in full view of photographers . Crisis talks: The royal, above, is expected to speak with his most senior aides and lawyers tomorrow . The deal meant Epstein – who was suspected for decades of paying for sex with dozens of under-age girls – was only ever convicted and jailed for 18 months on a single charge of soliciting paid sex with minors in 2008. Documents filed at a court in Florida further allege that Prince Andrew was among those who made ‘efforts’ to secure the paedophile a favourable deal. The legal claim refers to ‘Epstein’s lobbying efforts to persuade the [US] Government to give him a more favourable plea arrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince Andrew’. This has been strongly denied by the Palace, with an official telling the Mail yesterday: ‘The duke would never interfere in an active legal case and did not do so in this case.’ FRIDAY: ‘This relates to long-standing and ongoing civil proceedings in the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party. As such we would not comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.’ SATURDAY AFTERNOON: ‘A very serious allegation, of sex with a minor, was levelled at the duke in a legal document submitted to a US court. The earlier statement categorically rejected that claim; and as was indicated at the time, we do not intend to comment further.’ SATURDAY EVENING: In response to specific claims about Andrew’s alleged conduct: ‘It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.’ SUNDAY EVENING: Miss Roberts' father claimed his daughter had been introduced to the Queen - again denied in a statement by the Palace before reiterating the sexual claims are 'without foundation'. Last night police sources were reported to have said they would investigate if Miss Roberts made a formal complaint against the prince. A Metropolitan Police spokesman told the Daily Telegraph: ‘We have not received any allegations. If we did receive a complaint we would investigate it.’ Andrew has spent the past week holidaying in the upmarket Swiss ski resort of Verbier with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, their daughter, Princess Eugenie, and pals including Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend, Cressida Bonas. The prince, who is a keen skier, did not leave the chalet for the last two days of his holiday after the scandal broke. Pursing his lips pensively yesterday, Prince Andrew walked to his car in full view of waiting photographers, followed a few minutes later by Eugenie, to ensure they were not in the same picture. Andrew has no immediate public engagements in his diary but the Mail understands that he still plans to fly to Davos in Switzerland for the World Economic Forum on January 21. Sources say he will host a reception there for foreign ministers and business leaders in a personal capacity, as he has done in previous years, as part of a ‘business as usual’ strategy. One senior royal aide said: ‘There is no suggestion that this will be changed or cancelled. He is pushing forward with his existing schedule.’ Another source said Andrew felt ‘frustrated’ by the scandal, but decided that the seriousness of the allegations being made left him ‘no option but to speak out’. The source added: ‘The duke’s integrity is of utmost importance to him and he felt that was being traduced. We are working in very extraordinary circumstances and the decision was that a line needed to be drawn in the sand.’ Denial: Allegations were robustly denied by Buckingham Palace in an unprecedented three public statements . Furore: The scandal showed no signs of abating as Prince Andrew, left, and Princess Eugenie left the chalet . Allegations: Prince Andrew pictured with Virginia Roberts and Ghislaine Maxwell, right, in 2001 . It is unlikely, say aides, that Andrew will take legal action against Miss Roberts. A Buckingham Palace spokesman reiterated their statement that it was ‘emphatically denied’ that the prince had ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts’. ‘Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation,’ they said. They added that any suggestion of ‘impropriety with under-age minors is categorically untrue’. A £22,000-a-week getaway . Prince Andrew was staying in a £22,000-a-week chalet at the exclusive Swiss ski resort of Verbier as the sex claims emerged in the United States. The Duke of York was joined by his former wife Sarah Ferguson, their younger daughter Eugenie and Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend, Cressida Bonas. Located in one of the most exclusive parts of Verbier, the chalet boasts seven bedrooms, a heated indoor swimming pool, opulent entertaining area and a sauna.

Andrew, 54, is understood to have paid for the hire of the chalet. Looking pensive, he left the chalet yesterday afternoon and was driven to nearby airport, where he boarded a private plane to Britain with Eugenie, 24, and her boyfriend Jack Brooksbank. Last night it remained unclear who paid for the hire of the jet. Buckingham Palace declined to comment, but sources said the flight had been ‘privately funded’.

"Chief Inspector of the Constabulary Sir Tom Winsor said budget cuts mean a smaller police force that won't investigate less serious crimes . Police faced fury last night after the Chief Inspector of Constabulary warned forces may have to ignore crimes such as shoplifting. Sir Tom Winsor said looming budget cuts mean they will need to focus on offences that ‘matter most to people’. But critics accused him of promoting a cavalier approach to policing and pointed out shoplifting is not a victimless crime. Sir Tom, head of the police watchdog, said shrinking forces will need to ‘work smarter’, focusing on crimes such as violent or drug-related offences and sexual exploitation of children. He told BBC Radio 4: ‘Austerity is here to stay. We are heading for a smaller police service.’ Asked if there will be crimes that officers should not investigate ‘quite so hard’, Sir Tom replied: ‘Any crime that is reported to the police has to be taken seriously, however there are crimes that are more serious than others. ‘Nobody would argue that shoplifting is as serious as a violent assault and therefore the police need to look for the crimes that matter most to people.’ Last night, his comments provoked anger from MPs and retail experts. They said ignoring shoplifting would blight communities, damage the economy and have a knock-on effect on gang crime, drugs and anti-social behaviour. John Munro of the British Retail Consortium, said: ‘Shoplifting is not a victimless crime. It affects people who work in stores – often thefts can be violent and cause a great deal of damage and cost. ‘If you leave shoplifting unchallenged, it starts a spiral of decline where communities end up blighted by other crime.’ Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe says forthcoming cuts in police budgets will endanger the public unless ‘radical action’ is taken . Shoplifting is on the rise, with 321,014 thefts across England and Wales in the year to June, up 21,000 on the previous 12 months. Tory MP Michael Ellis, a criminal barrister, said: ‘As someone who has prosecuted shoplifters as well as more serious cases of violence and sexual offences, I think there has to be an understanding of the consequences of allowing offences of dishonesty. ‘As well as damaging the economy, it would be wrong to dismiss shoplifting cases in a cavalier fashion because these costs are met by the general public.’ Last month Scotland Yard Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe warned of a threat to public safety without radical police reforms in the face of budget cuts. Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation representing rank and file officers, called last night for a debate on which crimes the public wants officers to concentrate on. He said: ‘We can’t continue to police the way we have.’ Chief Constable Peter Vaughan, acting president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: ‘We have been prepared to expect further budget reductions in the coming years. 'An unprecedented rise in reports of child abuse, cyber-crime and public protection issues means that forces need to invest more heavily in these areas.’","Head of police watchdog Sir Tom Winsor said there's room for further cuts .

"Since the car radio was born 85 years ago there's been one golden rule - the driver picks the music. Now that could finally be about to change, thanks to technology which reportedly splits the family saloon into four 'personal sound zones' with no need for headphones. It works by having an array of speakers - in headrests and the car roof, for example - which direct a different set of sound waves towards each 'corner' of the car.

Noise-cancelling systems, which are already common in personal headphones, then monitor unwanted background noise in each corner and add 'inverse' sound waves to cancel it out. Such technology has been a long-held dream of audio engineers across the world, and a more primitive prototype was unveiled by British researcher Dr Jordan Cheer in 2013. Dr Cheer, of the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research at the University of Southampton, said his system provided two 'listening zones' - one for the front seats and one for the back. But the latest system is said to promise four zones - a major coup if so for its designer Harman, a U.S. audio firm which provides stereos to names including Audi, BMW, Fiat, Ferrari and Ford. Details of the new system are scant but it features today in the Sunday Times, where it is claimed Harman will unveil it this week at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Fight: Music choices prompt regular rows on road trips - though getting lost is still worse (posed by models) The effect, researchers claim, will be a car where each passenger listens to their own choice of music but can still hold a conversation over the din. The background noise could be cut by 20 decibels,  equal to reducing a normal voice in conversation to a whisper. According to the Sunday Times report, the system could go into production in as little as a year - though it is so far unclear what it would cost. Phil Eyler, Harman's general manager of global automotive audio, told the newspaper: 'Today, when a navigation prompt comes on, it interrupts the music for everyone. 'Now only the driver will hear ""Turn left in 100ft"". The music doesn't stop for other passengers'. Based in Detroit, Michigan - the down-on-its-luck former heart of the U.S. car industry - Harman employs more than 16,000 people and made sales of £3.65billion last year. Sit down! Researchers say drivers could soon hear sat nav instructions only for their corner of the car . Its revelation could help stop arguments over music, cited by an AA survey as the eight-biggest cause of in-car fights after driving too fast and not knowing the route. Getting it in your current car might be a bit tricky, though - since the most advanced hi-fi systems can already cost upwards of £10,000. Dr Cheer presented his previous theory to a 2013 conference in Montreal, Canada. He said at the time it 'would allow, for example, the driver to listen to a navigation system while the rear passengers watched a film'. He added: 'Personal audio systems have previously been implemented in mobile devices and monitors, for example, however, the investigation of the effects of an enclosure on the generation of personal listening zones has been limited.'","Technology is latest step in race for headphones-free personal music .
