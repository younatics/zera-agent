"Convictions: Master of the Rolls, Lord Dyson, is expected to rule that forcing workers to disclose minor convictions in all cases is a breach of their human rights . Workers who have committed minor offences should not have to admit their wrongdoing to employers, according a senior judge. In a landmark case, Lord Dyson is expected to rule that it is unlawful to make job applicants disclose minor crimes that were carried out when they were young. Despite Home Office concerns that changing the terms of disclosure could cause systematic chaos, the Master of Rolls is expected to say that the current system breaches the right to family and private life under the Human Rights Act. Under current rules, job applicants do not have to disclose convictions that are 'spent' under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. But workers still have to disclose all convictions and cautions under a Disclosure and Barring Service check - formerly known as a CRB check. These certificates are usually requested by employers in certain areas or work, such as healthcare or when dealing with children. Lord Dyson gave an outline of his ruling in the Appeal Court case of a 21-year-old man, known only as T. He received warnings from Manchester Police when aged 11 in connection with two stolen bicycles. The man was forced to disclose the information when applying for a job at a local football club when he was 17 and when applying to university. The judge said: 'It is extraordinary that . nothing has been done. The Government needs to pull its finger out and . introduce legislation.' Civil right group Liberty, who have been involved in the court case, reiterated that forcing workers to disclose minor offences when applying for jobs later is a breach of their human rights. Following the ruling, the Government will be forced to address whether they want to comply, alternatively having 28 days to appeal to the Supreme Court. One option would be to establish a system that removed old or minor convictions that were not followed by prison terms - with an exception for those seeking to work with children. New approach: Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said 'It is clear that we need a new approach to dealing with the disclosure of minor juvenile convictions' Critics, however, are likely to say that the fear of carrying a criminal record is a key deterrent to potential young offenders. The number of people forced to disclose offences is high, with four million requests for CRB certificates made by employers last year. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons . home affairs select committee, told the Telegraph: 'It is clear that we need a new . approach to dealing with the disclosure of minor juvenile convictions. 'Non-serious misdemeanours at a . young age should not affect someone’s chances in life, as was shown by . the farce of high-quality candidates having to stand down from the . Police and Crime Commissioner elections. 'While we need appropriate . safeguards in place, the system should be fair and proportionate.' Falklands War veteran Simon Weston has previously criticised the system after he was forced to pull out of the running for the police commissioner elections. He had been a passenger in a stolen car, aged just 14, prompting him to call for a change in the law. Corinna Ferguson, the legal officer for . Liberty, said: 'The overzealous CRB system has allowed old, minor and . unreliable information to wreck the lives of too many hard-working . people in the UK. The Government can’t put off dealing with this any . longer.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'The Court of Appeal has yet to make a ruling. We will respond when it does.'","Lord Dyson expected to rule that current system breaches human rights .

"A pensioner and his 16-year-old granddaughter have died after being buried alive by a landslide in an Italian village as storms batter the north of the country. Giorgio Levati, 70, and his granddaughter Adriana De Pena Moya were trapped under mountains of rubble at the family's two storey villa in Cerro, near Lake Maggiore yesterday. The house was partially buried in a 'sea of mud' after the rain-sodden hill behind the building gave way. The pensioner died under the rubble. Scroll down for video . Giorgio Levati, 70, and his granddaughter Adriana De Pena Moya were trapped under mountains of mud at the family's two storey villa in Cerro, near Lake Maggiore yesterday . The house was partially buried in a 'sea of mud' unleashed after the rain-sodden hill behind the building gave way . Rescue workers managed to drag Adriana from the rubble after more than four hours of digging but she died later in hospital. Her parents and grandmother survived. The family's small, two-storey villa was the only property affected in Cerro, a hamlet on the outskirts of Laveno Mombello, a popular holiday spot. A neighbour described how he had been awoken during the night by a huge bang 'like fireworks', and seeing rescue workers and the girl's parents 'digging with spades, even with their bare hands'. 'It was a horrific scene,' the neighbour told Italian television. The tragedy means a total of 11 people have died in Italy in accidents related to the freak weather conditions in just over a month. Carabinieri divers and fire brigades at work during the search operations for a missing person after torrential rain in Serra Ricco, near Genoa, Italy . A wave of storms and torrential rain is hitting many parts of northern Italy. It has seen the Liguria region hit with as much rain in the first 15 days of November as it normally gets in an entire year . It has seen the Liguria region hit with as much rain in the first 15 days of November as it normally gets in an entire year. The tragedies occurred just one day after storms in southern France left five people dead as their cars were swept away in flooding. On Friday, rescue workers managed to drag a father trapped in his car, lodged on a bridge, only to see the vehicle with his wife and two young sons still inside ripped away by the water. On Sunday in Switzerland, the bodies of two women, aged 34 and 38, were pulled from the rubble of the three-story apartment building in Davesco-Soragno, near Lugano, after being hit by the mudslide shortly before 2.30am local time, police said. A 44-year-old Italian man, who was living with one of the women, had been dug out and taken to hospital in a critical condition, police told reporters. Locals try to clean a damaged road the day after floods in Voltri, a neighborhood of Genoa, Italy . The tragedy means a total of 11 people have died in Italy in accidents related to the freak weather conditions in just over a month . Four others in the building at the time it collapsed had escaped with only minor injuries, while the final resident had not been home. A wall above the building had crumbled under the rain and set off the landslide, police said. That tragedy came 10 days after a young mother and her three-year-old daughter were killed when a landslide swept away their house in the same region. After weeks of heavy rain, southern Ticino has been hit by severe flooding, which worsened when Lake Lugano burst its banks in several places and Lake Maggiore threatened to do the same. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, speaking from the G20 summit in Australia, said the havoc wreaked by the heavy rain was the result of years of neglect of infrastructure. 'We have had 20 years of land management that needs to be scrapped,' he said. An estimated 70 coffins meanwhile were washed away after 50 metres of retaining wall in a cemetery in the Bolzaneto district of Genoa collapsed. Local residents reported skulls and other bones washing up on the banks of the Polcevera river.","Giorgio Levati, 70, and his granddaughter Adriana De Pena Moya were trapped under mountains of mud at the family's two storey villa in Cerro .

"Smart pills? Lisinopril is part of a family of blood pressure drugs called ACE inhibitors which could boost patients' brain power, research suggests . Doctors have long recognised that taking blood pressure drugs may slow the onset of Alzheimer’s. Now researchers have uncovered the first evidence that the drugs, called ACE inhibitors, may actually boost brainpower. Those with high blood pressure are more at risk of developing Alzheimer’s and similar diseases, but the study found their memory and thinking skills were protected by the drugs they were taking. ACE inhibitors – whose names  include ramipril, captopril and perindopril – have become increasingly popular in the past ten years, particularly for younger patients. Researchers in Ireland and Canada investigated drugs which target a specific biochemical pathway called the renin angiotensin system – a hormone system which is thought to affect the development of Alzheimer’s. The study compared the rate of cognitive decline in 361 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia (caused by problems in blood supply to the brain), or a mix of both. Of that group, 85 were already taking ACE inhibitors; the rest were not. The researchers also analysed the impact on 30 patients, with an average age of 77 years, who were taking the drugs for the first time. They were assessed over six months, using the Standardised Mini Mental State Examination or the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment tests. Those taking ACE inhibitors experienced marginally slower rates of cognitive decline than those who were not, found the study in the journal BMJ Open. Meanwhile, the brainpower of those patients who had been newly prescribed ACE inhibitors actually improved, the experts from University College Cork in Ireland and McMaster University in Ontario, Canada found. It is the first evidence to suggest these drugs may not only halt cognitive decline, but may actually improve brainpower. The researchers said: ‘Although the differences were small and of uncertain clinical significance, if sustained over years, compounding effects may well have significant clinical benefits.’ They warn that ACE inhibitors are harmful to some patients, so if larger studies confirm they work well in dementia, it may be only certain people with high blood pressure who stand to benefit. Caveat: Researchers warn that ACE inhibitors are harmful to some patients, so if larger studies confirm they work well in dementia, it may be only certain people with high blood pressure who stand to benefit . Previous studies have linked other forms of blood pressure medication with anti-dementia benefits. Dr James Pickett of the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘Any drug which halts cognitive decline is potentially exciting because it has the ability to radically improve quality of life.’ But Dr Simon Ridley of Alzheimer’s Research UK said: ‘This is a short study with a small number of participants. It is unclear if the [improvement] could be due to the control of blood pressure, a different effect of the drugs or another factor.’ Among the most widely used ACE inhibitors are perindopril (also known as Coversyl), ramipril (Tritace), captopril (Capoten), trandolapril (Gopten), fosinopril (Staril), lisinopril (Zestril and prinivil). They work by stopping the  body from creating the hormone angiotensin II. This has a variety  of effects but essentially relaxes blood vessels and helps reduce the amount of water re-absorbed by  the kidneys – helping decrease blood pressure.",ACE inhibitors have long been recognised as slowing onset of Alzheimer's .
"One of the world’s most tattooed men served as the guest of honour at the International Convention of Tattooists - but at least one person wasn't happy to see him.

"A care worker attacked a vulnerable 88-year-old man in 'revenge' after the dementia patient accidentally broke her mother's arm, a court heard. Siobhan Koralewski, 30, was a senior carer at Roundstone Residential Home in Scarborough, which her parents owned, when she slapped and bit the elderly patient who had injured her mother. Ms Koralewski is also accused of mistreating three other dementia patients including one woman who suffered from Down's Syndrome. Siobhan Koralewski was a senior carer at Roundstone Residential Home in Scarborough, which her parents owned, when she allegedly 'slapped and bit' the 88-year-old dementia patient who had injured her mother . Teesside Crown Court heard Ms Koralewski was allegedly angered the 88-year-old victim, who was confused and would lash out, had hurt her mother Margaret, and decided to mistreat her in return. Nicholas Afkins, prosecuting, told the court today the incident against the man on July 17, 2012, was witnessed by Siobhan's brother, Jeremy, who was employed as a cook in the residential home. Mr Afkins told jurors: 'The resident suffered from dementia and could become agitated – one day he kicked out at Margaret which caused her to fall on her shoulder. 'The next morning Siobhan decided to mistreat him by way of revenge. Siobhan slapped him across the face four times and Jeremy told her to stop but she ignored him. 'She pulled him by his leg and he fell on the floor then she sat astride him and bounced on top of him. She then squeezed his leg and bit it causing him to cry out in pain. 'Margaret was actually present at the time but she failed to intervene.' Jeremy Koralewski gave evidence against his mother and sister, who wept as he spoke, and told the court he had shouted at his sister over how she treated the man and three other residents. Siobhan and her mother Margaret, pictured to the front, are accused of mistreating four dementia patients in the care home. Siobhan allegedly stuffed toilet roll in the mouth of one woman who had Down's Syndrome . The incidents are claimed to have taken place between June 1 and November 30, 2012, and involve the four victims who all suffered from dementia. One incident involved a woman who suffered from Down's Syndrome - Siobhan was accused of forcing her to consume all of the drinks she had left for her during the day. The defendant was alleged to have told her boyfriend at the time she stuffed toilet roll in the resident's mouth to stop her from screaming.

"Banned: Jockey Tom Queally has been disqualified from driving for 22 months after he was arrested twice over the legal alcohol limit . A top jockey caught drink-driving walked free from court yesterday after claiming he was ‘sleep-driving’. Tom Queally, 30, who rode legendary winner Frankel, said he was a habitual sleep-walker and had no recollection of setting off in his BMW. When motorists saw him parked in the middle of the road and knocked on the window, he drove off and pulled on to a garage forecourt, where he fell asleep again with the engine running. He was woken by police who found he was more than two times the drink-drive limit. Drink-driving carries a maximum jail term of six months. Queally was represented by Nick Freeman – known as Mr Loophole after defending celebrities such as Sir Alex Ferguson and David Beckham against motoring charges – who said the jockey had been a sleep-walker from childhood. But millionaire Queally was forced to plead guilty to the offence as a sleeping condition is not a legal defence. He walked free from court after District Judge Bridget Knight banned him from the road for 22 months and ordered him to pay costs and fines of almost £5,000. Crewe Magistrates’ Court was told the Irish jockey, who earned £2.5million in one year, had been out for dinner with his agent Nicholas Whittle. He was supposed to sleep at Mr Whittle’s house, but got up and went off in his £70,000 BMW 730. He was spotted by another motorist asleep in the car at 5am on March 16 in the middle of a road in Knutsford, Cheshire. Queally then drove off and was later seen parked at a Shell garage five miles away, asleep in the passenger seat. When officers breathalysed him, he had 84mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath – more than twice the legal limit of 35mg. Kate Marchuk, prosecuting, said Queally ‘rolled out’ of a police car and curled up on the ground like he was napping. Mr Freeman said: ‘He was unaware of what he was doing – he was sleep-driving. The defendant’s last recollection was lying on the bed, fully clothed, reading Horse & Hound magazine. ‘While asleep... he drove for no reason 300 or so yards and parked in the carriageway. Mr Queally is blameless. This is not a man who has knowingly got into a car while drunk. He has no defence in terms of guilt but is completely innocent on a moral basis.’ Victory: The jockey is most famous for being the regular rider of 'wonder horse' Frankel. The pair are pictured winning the Qipco Champion Stakes during QIPCO British Champions Day at Ascot in 2012 . Dr Irshaad Ebrahim, of the London Sleep Centre, told the court: ‘Mr Queally has a long history of sleep-walking, and his brother and father were sleep-walkers. ‘From a medical perspective he was unaware of his actions.’ Outside court, Mr Freeman said it was time for sleep-walking to be recognised by the law, adding: ‘Perversely, had he raped or murdered someone, this would have provided him with a defence, but not for drink-driving – and that is not fair.’ Embarassing: Queally initally claimed he had not been drinking, then 'rolled' out of a police car and lay down on the ground after being arrested .","Police found Tom Queally asleep in Shell garage forecourt with engine on .

"Passengers stranded for hours on a freezing subway train during a 2010 blizzard are getting $2,500 from New York City's transit agency. The settlements were reached with 38 riders who sued the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. They were among some 500 passengers aboard A train that was trapped by two feet of snow. Some passengers stranded for hours on a freezing subway train during a 2010 blizzard are getting $2,500 from New York City's transit agency. Pictured: One of the passengers talks of his ordeal in 2010 . Passengers sat on the train for 10 hours without food, water or heat. 'When I think about it now, I can't believe it happened in New York City,' said Agnes Hui, one of two-dozen plaintiffs named in the biggest among a number of lawsuits. 'It was horrific,' she told the New York Daily News. Passengers on the stranded train said their frantic cellphone calls to 911 and the MTA did not result in any action - or even helpful information. With frost developing on the subway windows inside, passengers spent the night huddled together in one of the five cars to create some body heat, they said. One woman resorted to a makeshift toilet - outside between subway cars. Others urinated or defecated in the car filled with riders, some standing for hours because there wasn't enough room, according to the complaint. Passengers on the stranded train (pictured in 2010) said their frantic cellphone calls to 911 and the MTA did not result in any action - or even helpful information . Several passengers (pictured) had to be hospitalized after finally being rescued from the Manhattan-bound train, which was stuck on the tracks between the Aqueduct and Rockaway Boulevard stations . Several others had to be hospitalized after finally being rescued from the Manhattan-bound train, which was stuck on the tracks between the Aqueduct and Rockaway Boulevard stations. One rider developed bronchitis, another pneumonia. 'When the train was finally moved, the passengers were off-loaded at the next stop, in the freezing cold, with about three feet of snow on the ground,' the plaintiffs said in their lawsuit. Aymen Aboushi, a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs, tells the Daily News, the goal of the suit was to ensure it did not happen again. MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz called it 'a fair settlement for all parties involved.' Among measures the agency adopted after the storm was a customer advocate to ensure riders' well-being on stuck vehicles. But Hui, who was returning with her daughter from JFK Airport after a flight was canceled, said it 'was really maddening the MTA never apologized.' The blizzard was part of a mammoth blizzard that stretched from Florida to Maine. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration was criticized for its slow response to the foul weather and its aftermath (file photo 2014) More than 2 feet of snow fell on some parts of New York City, combined with strong winds that led to a massive transportation gridlock. Hundreds of buses were stuck on streets, commuter trains were frozen onto tracks and major airports closed. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration was criticized for its slow response to the foul weather and its aftermath.

"A curious new natural dietary supplement, most comparable to molasses, has been declared by Dr Oz as a powerful weight loss aid and a 'metabolism gamer changer', because it 'lowers hunger hormones.' Yacon syrup was recently road tested by The Dr Oz Show, and 73 per cent of the 40 women who trialed it lost weight - an average 2.9 lbs - simply by consuming one teaspoon of the mild sweetener with every meal for four weeks, and changing nothing else about their lifestyles. The fiber-packed syrup, extracted from the South American yacon root, is high in a compound called FOS; a digestion supporting prebiotic which feeds healthy gut bacteria and supposedly helps you feel full, at only 20 calories per tablespoon. Miracle goop? Yacon syrup (pictured) has been touted by Dr Oz as an effective weight-loss aid and a 'metabolism game changer'. It is high in fiber and digestion-supportive prebiotic FOS agents . Yacon syrup, which is said to taste like raisins, is actually nothing new - it's been around since Aztec times and people in Brazil and Peru have long touted it as a good low-sugar food that can help with diabetes, digestive problems and even kidney disorders. As for rock-solid scientific evidence on yacon syrup's benefits, there isn't much beyond Dr Oz's trial. Only one small study which was published in Clinical Nutrition in 2009, and found that obese women did experience 'a significant decrease in weight, cholesterol and insulin levels' after taking the syrup three times a day for four months. But don't get too excited. The women were also instructed to walk for 45 minutes a day and reduce their caloric intake, which appears to rather defeat the point of that particular exercise. And in the case of Dr Oz's study, the weight loss attributed to yacon syrup could also be down to a common diet-test phenomenon whereby research subjects subconsciously make better food choices while they are under the microscope - even when they are instructed not to change their lifestyles in any other way. To the test: Dr Oz (center) got 40 women (pictured) to take one teaspoon of yacon syrup with every meal for four months and reported that 73 per cent of them lost weight, an average 2.9lbs . A quick Amazon search on the top-selling brand of Yacon Syrup turns up generally good reviews from those who have tried it. Yacon syrup is a thick, molasses-like substance which can be used as a low-calorie natural sweetener and as a diet supplement. It is high is fiber and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) - which are prebiotic, non-digestible carbohydrates that act as food for healthy gut bacteria. The syrup is said to help with weight loss by regulating blood-sugar levels, reducing appetite and making you full, at only 20 calories per tablespoon. 'Like many, I bought this after seeing the Dr Oz segment. It did work for me, as I lost three lbs after a month of taking the yacon syrup,' one customer writes, although she points out that there are 'cheaper alternatives' of foods rich in FOS. Nineteen out of the 205 reviews were negative however, with one customer warning: 'This product was touted as being a stabilizing influence on blood sugar... but it was just the opposite.' Another writes: 'I took it morning and evening and gained ten pounds. My blood sugar went out of control. Never again.' Of course, while often helpful, reviews - much like the advice of Dr Oz, as history dictates - should be taken with a pinch of salt. MailOnline asked New York and LA-based . nutritionist Shira Lenchewski for her lowdown. 'To say that yacon syrup . will assist with weight loss is generous, but not totally bogus', she . says, but adds that the syrup is a 'promising sugar alternative'. Natural form: The yacon root (pictured) has been consumed by people in countries like Brazil and Peru for centuries, to aid with ailments including diabetes, digestive problems and kidney disorders . The benefits of digestion-boosting FOS are certainly plentiful, Ms Lenchewski claims: 'Gut health translates to overall health, so a robust flora ecosystem is essential for preventing inflammation and boosting intestinal immunity. It's also high in soluble fiber, which helps people feel full, and assists in mediating the body’s blood glucose response after a meal.' 'To say that yacon syrup will assist with weight loss is generous, but not totally bogus' She did warn however, that because yacon passes through the intestines largely undigested: 'It can be harsh on the gastro-intestinal  tract, especially in people with inflammatory bowel conditions, and may cause gas'. The consensus then appears to be that at best, yacon syrup may indeed assist with healthy weight loss, and at worst, it could have unwanted side effects. On balance however, its natural health properties do seem to outweigh the possible risks and, whether or not it truly works as a diet aid on its own, it makes for a good low-calorie sweetener.","In Dr Oz's trial on 40 women, 73 per cent lost an average on 2.9lbs, without otherwise changing their lifestyles .

"Chancellor George Osborne has failed to reduce welfare spending by as much as planned . The elderly receive £500 more every year from their State pension than they did four years ago, says a report. But the fact pensions have increased has slashed the savings the Government had pledged to make in public spending. Controversial cuts aimed at reducing the welfare bill have failed to save taxpayers the sums promised by ministers, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said. This is partly due to more generous pension benefits introduced at the same time as the cuts. Over the past four years, Chancellor George Osborne has unveiled cuts to tax credits and benefits aimed at saving £19billion a year. But spending on welfare will be just £2.5billion less this year than it was in 2010-11 in real terms. Ministers are likely to come under pressure to make further savings after the IFS suggested the Government had over-estimated the amount its cuts would save. The IFS said the savings gap was partly due to a more generous State pension, seen as an attempt by David Cameron to win the ‘grey vote’. Meagre pay rises in recent years have also left many workers reliant on housing benefits and working tax credits, pushing up welfare bills. The IFS said that when adjusted for inflation, Britain had saved £2.5billion this year compared with four years ago. The report’s author, economist Andrew Hood, said: ‘Mr Osborne wants further cuts to social security spending to help reduce the deficit. But he may end up having to make cuts just to stay on track.’ The IFS said that while some benefits such as Jobseekers’ Allowance had been cut, pensioner benefits had risen. The State pension bill has gone up sharply because of a number of changes including the ‘triple lock’, introduced two years ago. The lock guarantees price rises in line with earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent – whichever is the highest – to protect OAPs from paltry increases. But this will cost an additional £45billion over the next 15 years according to estimates. The IFS think-tank also said the UK’s housing benefit bill will be £1billion higher in 2014–15 than it was in 2010–11, despite promises it would be slashed by £2billion. The rising state pension has contributed to a £5billion increase in spending on OAP welfare, a new study has revealed . This was blamed on poor wage growth and rising rent prices, leaving many reliant on handouts to make ends meet. Poor pay rises also meant the Government had to pay more in working tax credits for employees on low salaries. Cuts of £4.6billion to tax credits were announced, but will drop by £2.7billion compared with 2010-11, the IFS said. The report also blamed ‘significant’ delays in implementing changes to the disability living allowance (DLA). The Government had predicted cuts of £1.2billion, but the study said DLA spending would actually rise by £1.6billion. Mr Hood said: ‘The government haven’t implemented all the cuts that they announced. ‘But more importantly other things like the number of pensioners and low-paid people have pushed up spending in real terms.’ However falling unemployment meant the Jobseekers’ Allowance bill dropped by £1.3billion, much more than the £100million ministers had pledged to cut.","Osborne pledged to slash £19bn off the welfare and pensions budget .

"A blogger who spent one year following all of the Bible’s instructions for women, from making her own clothes to 'submitting' to her husband, has now written a book about her experience. Rachel Held Evans’ book, A Year of Biblical Womanhood, chronicles her 12 month attempt to obey the Bible's . commandments for women. The Bible gives hundreds of rules for . women to follow, both explicit and implied, in the Old Testament and the New. Going to extremes: Rachel Held Evans spent 12 months following the Bible's instructions for women, from making her own clothes to 'submitting' to her husband . For example, women should . dress modestly, submit to their husbands - passages of the Bible insist that husbands are the masters of their wives - and . remove themselves from their communities while menstruating. Leviticus Chapters 15 to 18 has a passage detailing rules for women to . live by - with particularly stringent rules coming into play while the . woman is menstruating, stemming from the theory that women on their . periods are untouchable. During the days she was menstruating . over the course of the year, the Tennessee-based writer, 31, a Christian who . describes herself as 'liberated', stayed home from church, carried around a seat cushion to avoid sitting on chairs outside her home, abstained from sex and touching her husband, grew her hair out and slept in a tent. Before embarking on the 12-month experiment Mrs Evans wrote on her blog: 'Starting this month, I will commit one year of my life to following all of the Bible’s instructions for women as literally as possible. Going back to basics: During the days she was menstruating over the course of the year Mrs Evans removed herself from the community and slept in a tent . Learning new skills: Mrs Evans took up sewing as she started making her own clothes . 'From the Old Testament to the New . Testament, from Genesis to Revelation, from the Levitical code to the . letters of Paul, there’s no picking and choosing... Well, except for polygamy and a few other things that I’ll tell you about later.' Among other things her new lifestyle involved rising before dawn each day (Proverbs 31:15), growing out her hair (1 Corinthians 11:15), calling her husband Dan 'master' (1 Peter 3:5-6), and camping out in the backyard for the duration of her monthly period (Leviticus 15:19-33). She also started making her own clothes, (Proverbs 31:22) and learned how to cook (Titus 2:3-5). Talking about her experience, she told Gypsyink.com: 'Some of these experiences were funny, others were rewarding, and others were terrible.' In one YouTube video, Mrs Evans offers advice to other women who are considering camping when they are menstruating. Sat in her tent, she tells viewers: 'You’re going to need a flash light, some blankets and a sleeping bag, some reading material and a walkie talkie to call for help if you get attacked by a cat. 'Take it from me practicing biblical womanhood isn’t as simple as it sounds.' Mrs Evans' project-turned-book examines all the Bible's instructions for women as precisely as possible, taking on powerful theological questions, gender issues, and the possible future of the Church. Playing by the rules: Mrs Evans dressed modestly as she attempted to obey the Bible's commandments . Using her book's platform, she says she aims to challenge evangelical leaders and advocate an increase . of women within church leadership. Mrs Evans also writes a namesake blog . that draws thousands of evangelical readers, which she . launched in 2008 to promote her first book, a memoir that tiptoed . around faith and fundamentalism. Her yet-to-be-released book has already gained a following, with nearly 100,000 readers visiting her blog monthly. Her publisher said they expected 40per cent of her book’s total sales would come from Christian bookstores. However, despite the book's popularity, she has revealed that one of the biggest Christian bookstore chains in the country, LifeWay, has chosen not to carry the book because of its use of the word 'vagina'. She told Slate: 'I don’t know if they were more offended by my vagina or my brain. The only thing I know is that my editor said, ""If you leave this word in, there’s a good chance LifeWay won’t carry it."" When Mrs Evans mentioned on her blog that her editor suggested she remove the word vagina from the book’s manuscript to appease the Christian bookstore,  her readers were outraged. Homebody: In deference to Titus 2:3-5 and 1 Timothy 5:14, Mrs Evans tried to stay 'busy in the home,' honing her cooking skills, she is seen here with homemade matzah toffee for Passover . Praise him like I should: Proverbs 31:23 states that a virtuous woman's husband is 'respected at the city gate,' so Mrs Evans made a poster that said 'Dan is Awesome' and stood in front of the 'Welcome to Dayton' sign . A petition on Amazon called Put the word ‘vagina’ back into . Rachel's book! was started, and one fan made Team Vagina T-shirts. She added: 'Writers adjust our content to fit this very sanitized, very strict conservative mold, which means we’re not producing the best writing or the best books we can produce. 'Everyone bends over backward to meet these demands.' But with such a large show of public support, Mrs Evans decided to leave the word vagina in her book and face the consequences.

"The idea of eating bloody human flesh would be repulsive and inconceivable to most people. But one new father has told how he ate his wife’s placenta raw in a smoothie, and cooked in a taco. Nick Baines, a food and travel writer, says he made the decision because he wanted to know how it would taste. Scroll down for video . Nick Baines cooked and ate his wife's placenta (pictured) after the birth of his son . Writing in The Guardian, he said: ‘As I seasoned it on the chopping board, the bright, almost glowing red chunk of placenta was more attractive than many cuts of offal I've dealt with, and looked quite appetising. ‘The meat was rich, with a beef-like quality. It was tender, kind of like roast brisket and not dissimilar to Texas BBQ.’ Mr Baines says he was interested in trying the placenta from the moment he and his wife first started to discuss having a baby. He said that he is in inquisitive meat-eater and that he was reluctant to miss out on this rare opportunity. However, he admits that the idea became rather less appealing when he was faced with the newly removed placenta and the bewildered, and slightly repulsed, midwives. In the end, rather than taking the whole placenta, he left the hospital with ‘a few cheeky steaks’. Mr Baines made the placenta into a smoothie and put it in tacos with paprika and garlic (pictured) Mr Baines says the smoothie was 'rank' and that it made him feel nauseous . The next day, while his wife hid in a different room, he blended part of the raw flesh to make a smoothie. And the taste? 'Up front was the distinct flavour of banana, superseded by a metallic, bloody backnote. It had a mineral earthiness to it and tasted exactly like the delivery room had smelled.' Placentophagy - or the eating of the placenta - has become increasingly popular in recent years. Some . mothers now eat their placentas in the hope of reaping health benefits . from fending off post-natal depression to improving milk supply. However, those who are too squeamish for this now have another option. They can pay to have their placentas transformed into little pills that can be taken for years after the birth. The . companies that make these pills say they are full of essential . nutrients and hormones and that they can help reduce stress and aid . mother-child bonding. However, . critics argue that there is no evidence that eating the placenta offers . any health benefits and that it can actually cause infections.

In contrast, he says he actually enjoyed the cooked flesh which he served in a taco with garlic and paprika.

"Over the course of a year, 2.2 million flights blanket the skies above the UK - peaking at 8,000 in a single day. These flights are managed by NATS (formerly known as National Air Traffic Services), which is responsible for monitoring airspace above more than 180 public and private airports, military training flights centres and helipads. To put this 'spider's web' of traffic into perspective, NATS has produced the third in its series of air traffic visualisations, taking a tour of the UK’s airspace, called UK 24. Scroll down for video . More than 2.2 million flights are managed by the Swanwick and Prestwick-based NATS, formerly known as National Air Traffic Services in airspace over the UK (pictured). Flights peak at more than 8,000 a day and the visualisation plots 7,000 of these movements . ‘Following the success of our two data visualisations - Europe 24 and North Atlantic Skies - we’ve taken a lot of time to think about where to go next,’ said head of operational policy, Brendan Kelly. ‘Both Europe 24 and North Atlantic Skies were designed to give an overview of the daily complexity and volumes of air traffic across the UK and Europe and to do so in a way that was cinematic and exciting to watch. ‘I think we were able to do that to great effect, but we now want to take you a little deeper. ‘We are therefore very excited to publish UK 24 - your guided tour to some of what makes UK aviation work.’ During the visualisation, around 7,000 flights are shown entering and leaving UK airspace. The day starts with the bow wave of transatlantic traffic heading towards the UK on organised and separated tracks. This is joined by traffic from Europe and the first waves of departures from UK airports. Traffic levels are then seen growing to reveal the main ‘trunk roads’, or routes, of airspace as well as the hubs around London, Manchester and central Scotland. The visualisation then shows holding stacks over London, also known as a holding manoeuvre that is used to delay a flight from landing, but keep it within the airspace. The tour then moves around the UK to include the other major airports and NATS’ two control centres in Swanwick and Prestwick. There are also visualisations of military training flights, showing RAF jets performing manoeuvres training off the east coast of England and near to North Wales.

To create the video, visualisation experts from a company called 422 South combined 24 hours worth of flight radar data from all UK flights. Computer artists then used specially developed software to convert the longitude, latitude and height data into luminous dots, which were accurately positioned over satellite images of Britain, by day and by night.

It showed 2,524 flights crossing the North Atlantic, of which 1,273 pass through the Shanwick Oceanic Control Area. At its busiest, traffic can peak at 1,500 flights a day in the summer.

"A couple's wedding was broken up by Home Office staff at the last minute because the American bride was feared to have the wrong visa. David Rouillon, 24, and Erika Britt Malone, 26, were about to say 'I do' at the Blackburn Register Office, Lancashire, when the ceremony was halted by immigration officers. Mr Rouillon said his fiancée, who is from California, was 'treated like a terrorist' by officials, who had handed her a notification that she was 'a person who is liable to be detained' under the Immigration Act 1971. Couple: David Rouillon, 24, and Erika Britt Malone's wedding was halted by immigration officers at the last minute because the 26-year-old American bride was feared to have the wrong visa. Mr Rouillon is pictured holding the notification stating Miss Malone is 'a person who is liable to be detained' 'I was completely in shock,' Mr Rouillon said. 'It was meant to be the best day of our lives and we were so excited, but it turned into a nightmare.' Miss Malone is understood to have entered the UK on a holiday visa, without entry clearance as a fiancée. She was ordered to surrender her passport. A  Home Office spokesman said officials attended the wedding not because they thought it was a sham marriage, but to determine the status of the bride-to-be. The couple met around 18 months ago through online gaming and Mr Rouillon decided to visit Miss Malone in Aubern, Placer County, California to take their relationship further, becoming engaged after a few months. Interrupted: Mr Rouillon and Miss Malone were about to say 'I do' at the Blackburn Register Office, Lancashire, when they were taken into a separate room and questioned by immigration officers . 'I flew out on February 14 last year and we had been talking every day,' said Mr Rouillon. “I knew there was something special. We love each other and we got engaged..” The groom’s father Cliff added: 'They got on and connected really well. Erika is David’s first proper girlfriend and they got on really well because they are both quite introverted.' Miss Malone took out a holiday visa for three months and arrived in Blackburn to stay with her future husband’s family. The father-of-the-groom added: 'One of the reasons they did it was to surprise us because they got engaged in San Francisco. Family: The couple with Mr Rouillon's parents Menchu (left) and Cliff (right), who said immigration officers had 'jumped out' as the couple were waiting to get married . 'When they said they wanted to get married, we ran round to get everything ready.' The wedding date was set five weeks in advance and Miss Malone said she had been excited about the day. 'I was really looking forward to it. I got my make-up done and my hair and nails,' she said. Notice: The letter given to Miss Malone on what would have been her wedding day . Miss Malone wore a knee-length black dress with flowers in her hair and carried a bouquet of purple and cream blooms when she arrived at the Register Office. But when Mr Rouillon and his fiancée were asked to go into a separate room to answer some questions, they realised something was wrong. Cliff Rouillon added: 'All of a sudden, immigration officers jumped out and said there was not going to be a wedding. I was stunned. 'They told my wife Menchu and I to get out of the room. I shouted back because I was really angry. It was just ridiculous. 'Erika brought all of her documentation and the register office had not said there was any problem. 'It was not a big wedding, but it is better for them to spend money on tickets back to America, rather than on a lavish wedding.' Mr Rouillon said the couple had not been planning to spend much longer in Blackburn, as Miss Malone’s visa was due to run out on December 10. He said: 'We were going to spend Christmas together in America and then I was going to come back on my own. 'Erika has been treated like a terrorist and they would not even let me see her.' Miss Malone said she was questioned for around 90 minutes. She said: 'They just came in and told me they could arrest me. It seemed like I was being interrogated for forever. Preparations: Miss Malone had brought flowers to the Register Office, and the couple had their wedding rings ready for the ceremony . 'I was really scared and at first I was just bawling. 'They said I am a person who has entered the UK by way of verbal deception and they were asking me all kinds of questions like why I was here and all kinds of dates that I could not remember. 'I was panicking. They did not believe that nobody asked me if I was planning to get married.' When Miss Malone was released, she was told she must surrender her passport and go to a reporting centre to get permission to stay. The groom's mother, Menchu Rouillon said her son and would-be daughter-in-law are still planning on tying the knot. 'We love Erika like a daughter,' she said. 'This was all just a nightmare, but they are just two youngsters in love and nobody will tell them they cannot get married.' Miss Malone is understood to have arrived in the UK without entry clearance as a fiancée, instead relying on entry as a visitor. If she makes the correct application in the future and it is accepted, she could still marry in the UK at a later date. A Home Office spokesman said Miss Malone’s passport was now with her file and would be sent to the airport once confirmation of her return flight on December 10 was produced today. He said: 'We are building an immigration system that is fair to British citizens and legitimate migrants and tough on those who flout the law. 'Where officials have reason to doubt the legitimacy of a wedding ceremony, or the immigration status of either party involved, they will seek to take appropriate action.'","David Rouillon, 24, was preparing to wed Erika Britt Malone, 26 .

Xue was sitting on the toilet sending text messages to her boyfriend when the toddler walked in and asked if he could play a game on her mobile phone. Distressing scenes: Three-year-old Qiang Qiang being carried by his parents at hospital after his aunt, Xue Paan, 37, cut his penis off when he burst in on her on the loo and asked to use her mobile phone . Innocent: Qiang Qiang walked in on his aunt as she was sending messages to her boyfriend and asked if he could play a game on her mobile phone. She reacted by getting a kitchen knife and slicing off his penis . Instead of giving him the phone, the aunt went into the kitchen, picked up a knife, then came back and sliced off the boy's penis. She fled the house before his mother could return. Qiang Qiang's mother Cai Tuan, 27, said: 'I had popped out to see a neighbour and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream. 'I ran back to the house and couldn't believe what I saw. 'Qiang Qiang had fainted and was lying in a pool of blood. 'Next to him was a knife and his penis. 'It was simply horrific. 'My sister, his aunt, had gone.' Qiang Qiang was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to reattach his appendage and was then sent to a specialist clinic in the capital Beijing. Emergency surgery: Qiang Qiang was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to reattach his penis . Pain and grief: The boy's distraught mother and father wait for their son to be treated at the hospital . A hospital spokesman said: 'Unfortunately, the knife was quite blunt and the cut wasn't clean so although we reattached the boy's penis, it wasn't ideal and he had to have further treatment. 'However, he has now had three surgeries all of which have been successful and we are confident that his penis will be perfectly OK again in three months.' A police spokesman said: 'The aunt was arrested and admitted attacking the boy because she was angry that he had interrupted her on the toilet.' She now faces 5 years in jail.","Qiang Qiang interrupted his aunt Xue Paan as she was texting her beau .

"Locking 26-year-old victim Warriena Wright outside on a 14th floor balcony was akin to locking someone in a trunk to suffocate, prosecutors have told the bail hearing of accused murderer Gable Tostee in the Brisbane Supreme Court. Lawyers for Tostee, the 28-year-old carpet layer charged with murdering New Zealand woman, Ms Wright, on the Gold Coast in August are applying to have him freed on bail. They have told the court Tostee would give up alcohol and using the mobile dating app Tinder - on which he met Ms Wright - if freed on bail to await trial. Justice Debra Mullins, who has adjourned the hearing until Wednesday, has told the court the case 'is not in any view a straightforward case of murder'. Scroll down for video . Tragic death: Warriena Wright (pictured) fell to her death from the 14th floor of Gable Tostee's Surfers Paradise apartment in the early hours of August 8 this year, just days before the 26-year-old was due to return home to New Zealand . Tinder date: Gable Tostee (pictured) says he did not murder Warriena Wright,following their meeting via the mobile dating app Tinder in Cavill Mall, Surfers Paradise, then on to his nearby high rise apartment . The Avalon apartments (above) in Surfers Paradise on Queensland's Gold Coast were the scene of the fatal fall by Warriena Wright 14 storeys to the ground at around 2.20am on August 8 this year . Tostee's lawyers, from  Robertson O'Gorman, the Brisbane firm appointed by Tostee following his first bail hearing two months ago, have said in the hearing he is 'always on guard' against fellow inmates at the Athur Gorrie Correctional Centre, where he has been held since his arrest. Warriena Tagpuno Wright, 26, fell to her death from the balcony of Tostee's 14th-floor luxury apartment at around 2.20am on August 8, hours following a night together after they met at Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise via the mobile dating app Tinder. Mr Tostee was arrested a week later.  Following the first, adjourned part of his bail hearing, Tostee replaced his original legal team with renowned Queensland civil liberties lawyer, Terry O'Gorman. Mr Tostee denies he murdered Ms Wright. Mr Tostee appointed Mr O'Gorman following the civil libertarian's comments about the release of court documents including an alleged transcript of Ms Wright's night with him, taped on his phone, and a damning police affidavit of what occurred between the two in the hours before Ms Wright's death. The prosecution claims Tostee has a ‘bizarre indifference to Ms Wright's death’ and that she had been affected on the night of her death by alcohol in the form of a ‘white spirit’ made by him. Justice Mullins has made mention during the hearing of the accused’s autism and social anxiety. Fatal meeting: Warriena Wright (above, left) was holidaying on the Gold Coast after attending a friend's wedding, when the 26-year-old New Zealand bank clerk fell to her death from Gable Tostee's (above, right) high rise balcony apartment. Mr Tostee is in custody and an application for bail may now be postponed . Devastated: Warriena Wright (above, right) with sister, Reza, who was devastated by the death . Mr O'Gorman described as 'absolutely worrying' police claims in the affidavit filed in the Brisbane Supreme Court, which included that Mr Tostee and Ms Wright allegedly had a fight before she fell. The police affidavit was among eleven documents filed for Gable Tostee's first bail application, before  Justice Debra Mullins, who adjourned the matter to give Mr Tostee's defence team more time. Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden told that hearing Mr Tostee was unlikely to have been on the balcony when Ms Wright plunged 14 storeys to her death. Justice Mullins described the Crown prosecutor's case for murder as 'weak' and 'difficult', but said a case of manslaughter would be 'strong'. Justice Mullins said a diagnosis of autism for Gable Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his Surfers Paradise apartment on the night Ms Wright died. 'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' she told Mr Tostee's defence, 'but in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.' No medical files about Mr Tostee's alleged autism condition, nor any additional documents have yet been filed for Mr Tostee's new bail application.

"An engaged father-of-one was shot dead this weekend, after getting into a fight with an acquaintance at a concert where he was performing with his hardcore punk band. Brad Hancock's band Close Grip was playing a warm-up set at Salt Lake City, Utah venue At The Core Saturday night, when he tried to kick 20-year-old Quincy Earl Lawson out of the concert. Friends of the 24-year-old frontman say Hancock was trying to defend his brother who had gotten in an argument with Lawson, and that when the dispute moved to the parking lot, Lawson fired shots at Hancock and another band member.

Police say Hancock and Lawson 'kind of knew each other', but do not appear to have been close friends. Hancock's fianceé Mariah Borg, mother of their 1-year-old son Sonny, told the Deseret News that Lawson was known for getting in trouble, but that she didn't know he was capable of killing anyone. She says her boyfriend left for the concert at 5pm on Saturday, and that she received a phone call just a few hours later from a relative saying he had died.

"A mother-of-one who piled on the pounds during pregnancy because she couldn't resist her cravings for snacks has lost three stone in just 12 weeks thanks to overhauling her diet and exercising. Sarah Harris, 27, from Paignton, Devon, was carrying a stone-and-a-half of extra weight after the birth of her daughter Lucie. Terrified to return to her former job as a gym instructor, Sarah started a one-woman campaign to fight the flab and went down from 13st 2lb to 9st 12st in three months. Fat fighter: Sarah managed to drop from 13st 2lb (left) to 9st 12st (right) in three months on her strict regime . During her pregnancy, Sarah took cravings to the extreme. She ate at bizarre times, sometimes surviving only on cereal until 11pm at night. At the time, she was working as a teacher and would have a hot chocolate and a piece of cake in every break, as well as munching her way through three boxes of Rice Krispies a week. Sarah said: 'During my pregnancy and afterwards I was used to reaching for snacks all the time and I had some of the weirdest cravings of any of my friends. 'My husband, Paul, couldn't believe it when I would come back from the supermarket with another three boxes of cereal. 'Even after Lucie was born, I missed meals because of my daughter's sleeping habits and just ate what I could when I had a spare moment.' She added: 'After I had my Lucie I thought it would just fall away but I found myself much bigger than I'd ever been before. 'I couldn't believe I was still so heavy after I gave birth, my daughter was only 6lb 9oz!' Sarah had once worked as a gym instructor so was used to being in shape. After becoming a mother, she wanted to return to her first profession rather than teaching but she felt she couldn't be a gym instructor again unless she practised what she preached. Expecting: Sarah's weight gain began during pregnancy, where intense cravings saw her eating stodgy foods . Pumping iron: Sarah began heading to the gym three times a week in the morning and evening . Work out: As well as cardio Sarah embarked on an intensive weights regime for a hour three times a week . Sarah now has regained her confidence enough to go back to working as a gym instructor . So she committed to a radical body transformation programme co-ordinated by Ultimate Sports Nutrition. She ditched the sugary snacks and cereal for a protein-heavy diet with lots of vegetables. She also began heading to the gym three times a week in the morning and evening. To fit in the exercise as a new mother, she often did a 4.30am cardio workout and an hour in the evening pumping iron. Her hard work paid off and after 12 weeks Sarah had lost 3st 4lb. She was so pleased with her body transformation, that despite being intimidated to even enter a gym after she gave birth, she has had the confidence to return to work as a gym instructor. 'It feels so great to be back in shape and to have got here so quickly,' she said. 'I'm so glad I did the challenge. Even though it was sometimes hard getting up so early and motivating myself to get the gym, the reward is when I look in the mirror and know that I can be a fit and healthy mum for my daughter.' Breakfast: Biscuits . Lunch: Cheesy Panini with a hot chocolate and a cake. Snacks: Another hot chocolate and cake or a chocolate bar. Bowels of Rice Krispies . Dinner: Chicken curry or lasagne .

"The message upon entering the village proudly declares: 'Stamfordham welcomes you, not litter'. But it appears the rather modest sign, planted in a bed of daffodils, is not having the desired effect. In recent weeks, one resident has become increasingly frustrated at having to pick up a deluge of rubbish outside her home, including condoms and pornographic videos. Rubbish row: Jo Riddell has been causing a stink in her village with her anti-litter signs, which she felt compelled to put up after having to collect piles of detritus outside her home . Garish: Mrs Riddell's signs have been causing offence in some quarters due to the use of the word 'tosser' and their 'ghastly' yellow colour . So when Jo Riddell decided to take a . more obviously proactive approach, she could be forgiven for thinking . she would have the backing of her fellow villagers. Instead, the 49-year-old has found herself at the centre of a storm after her bright-yellow signs bearing the slogan 'Don't be a tosser - take your rubbish home' were branded 'offensive and garish'. She put up the placards after claiming to have collected 27 bags of rubbish along . the roadside on her land in the Cheeseburn Grange Hall Estate, near . Stamfordham, Northumberland in recent weeks. Most were thrown from . passing cars. The Grade II*-listed Cheeseburn Grange has been home to the Riddell family for generations. Mrs Riddell has lived on the estate for 24 years with husband Simon, managing director of an agricultural company, and they have three children Ed, 25, Camilla, 21, and Henrietta, 18. Idyllic: The villagers of Stamfordham in Northumberland, where Mrs Riddell lives, is clearly keen to keep their community tidy, but many have objected to the 49-year-old landowner's tactics . 'Shocking and shameful': Mrs Riddell with some of the rubbish she has been collecting along the roadside on her land on the Cheeseburn Grange Hall Estate, including condoms and pornographic videos . But her signs have caused offence to some villagers and two have been ripped down. Edward Trevelyan, chairman . of Stamfordham Parish Council, who has lived in the village for 30 . years, said: 'They are ghastly notices, an eyesore and they’re rude. It’s garish and defacing the countryside. I’ve had about six or seven . complaints from residents. I hope they will be removed.' Mrs Riddell, 49, said: 'I can’t walk three paces around the estate without coming across litter. I have picked up condoms, needles and pornographic videos along with all the bottles, cans, plastic and paper. It’s shocking and shameful. It’s been getting worse in recent years. 'I was inspired by a trip to Australia. I was walking along Bondi beach and the signs were along it. They said: ‘Don’t be a bloody tosser - take your rubbish home.' Controversial: Mrs Riddel says she sought legal advice and spoke to the Campaign to Protect Rural England before putting up the signs . She claims she had no idea what 'tosser' meant until a friend commented on how brave she was using the word. 'I had to look it up on Google. It was a bit of an ""oops"" moment,' she said. 'I . was brought up with the Queen’s English. But before I put the signs up, . I consulted legal experts and I made sure they were only on my land. I . also sought advice from the Campaign to Protect Rural England and there . was no problem.' She added: 'I’m sorry if the signs cause offence and I know there have been some complaints. I’m a law-abiding citizen and if I have broken the law, I will take them down.' Parents of children at nearby Stamfordham First School were divided on the issue. Louise Chalmers, 40, who has a daughter Lily, five, said: 'I think they’re terrible. There was something in the village newsletter about it. 'It is a bit awkward to have to explain to a five-year-old what the word means. 'Lily is just learning to read and when she saw the sign she asked what the word meant. 'I think it is inappropriate and I don’t even think it will work.' Sarah Bell, 42, a full-time mother from Matfen, Northumberland, said: 'I thought it was funny and puts the point across, but I can see some people might be offended.'","Jo Riddell ruffles feathers in village after sticking up 'garish' yellow signs .

"Motor racing star Sir Stirling Moss has caused controversy by saying he didn't want 'a poofter or anything like that' to play him in a film. His comments came during an interview when he said he would like a 'masculine' actor like James Bond actor Daniel Craig to portray him in any biopic. The 83-year-old Formula One legend then made matters worse by backtracking, claiming he had 'homosexual friends' and that 'there's nothing wrong with it'. 'I've spent my life chasing girls': Stirling Moss, with third wife Susie, would like a 'masculine' actor to play him . Sir Stirling also said he would need a masculine actor because he had spent his life 'driving cars and chasing girls'. Today gay and lesbian campaigners condemned him for his homophobia. Stonewall's Ben Summerskill said: ‘Rugby players like Gareth Thomas, boxers like Orlando Cruz, and any of the brave gay people currently serving their country in Afghanistan might be a little better qualified to comment on masculinity than the accomplished car driver Sir Stirling Moss.’ Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: 'It is a shame that such a great British sporting hero has resorted to this crude homophobic language. Prejudice has no place in any sport. 'Surely Stirling Moss would want himself to be played by the best actor, regardless of their sexuality?' Sir Stirling's musings on who might play him were sparked at the London Motor Hall of Fame when he heard that the married . Australian actor Chris Hemsworth was playing the late Formula 1 champion . James Hunt in a film. The 'masculine' choice? Daniel Craig, seen here in Bond film Casino Royale, would be Sir Stirling's favourite . He said: 'I hope the actor would be masculine, not a poofter or anything like that.  Perhaps the guy from Skyfall?' This afternoon the veteran driving star dug himself a little deeper when he tried to defend his comments. He told MailOnline: 'Certainly I've got very many friends who are of the different persuasion; I just wouldn't want to be that way and I'm glad I'm not. 'They are not going to make a film about me in any case but if they did, I think someone who's masculine would be better than someone who's effeminate, because I've spent my whole life chasing crumpet and racing cars. Women and fast cars: Stirling Moss, seen here at the 1955 British Grand Prix, won hundreds of races . Colourful past: Stirling Moss and Penthouse Pet Susie Lambie in a replica of a 1901 Ford Motor Car . He added: 'That's what I was all about - going around the world and spreading happiness.  It wouldn't obviously work if I was played by that lovely chap Kenneth Williams who played upon being poofy.' 'I'm sorry I've caused offence, but I didn't mean to cause any.  I personally am very grateful to homosexuals because the more of them there are around, the more women are free for me.' Sir Stirling had a glittering career on the motor-racing circuit, winning 16 Formula One Grands Prix before he retired at 43 in 1962 after a crash left him in a coma for a month. Known as the 'greatest driver never to win the World Championship', Sir Stirling won millions of fans in the fiercely competitive racing world, loved as much for his character as his driving skills. Stirling Moss dated many women including model Diana Terry, left, before settling down with wife Susie, above . He preferred to race British cars, . saying 'Better to lose honourably in a British car than win in a foreign . one', and believed the manner in which the race was fought was as . important as the outcome. Off . the track, Sir Stirling was as voracious in his thirst for women as he . was for motor-racing victory. He and James Hunt were often seen . surrounded by beautiful admirers in the casinos and nightclubs of Monte . Carlo. Many hearts were broken when Sir Stirling married for the first time.  He met his first wife, Canadian brewer's daughter Katie Molson, on the track at Le Mans, and married her at St Peter's, Eaton Square, in 1957. Their marriage lasted just two years, and in 1964 he married the glamorous American, Elaine Barberino.  But that marriage, too, was not to last, despite her having his daughter Alison, and they divorced in 1968. Australian actor Chris Hemsworth as Stirling Moss's old friend James Hunt in the forthcoming film Rush . It was a question of third time lucky . for Sir Stirling - in 1980 he married Susie Paine, a young British woman . practically half his age - and they have a son, Elliot. But . being happily married has not made the racing legend boring: last year . he told an interviewer he enjoyed sex was 'still extremely important to . me', and said he would like to live for ever, as long as 'I could have . Susie with me'. Three years ago, Sir Stirling fell . three storeys down a lift shaft in his London house, breaking both . ankles as he landed on its concrete base.  He also broke four bones in . one foot, chipped some vertebrae, and suffered skin damage in the . accident in March 2010. However his spirit was not dented, . and Lady Moss quipped soon afterwards that he had recovered well enough . to be complaining about the hospital breakfast.","Formula One star made comments at Motor Racing Hall of Fame in London .

"America's most experienced fighter pilot flew 151 combat missions around the world -- bravely attracting enemy fire so he could seek out and destroy enemy weapons. Lt Col Dan Hampton sat in the cockpit of a F-16 fighter plane for 20 years, logging more than 600 combat hours -- helping to secure the skies over Iraq and to protect American airspace after the September 11 terrorist attacks. He recounts his harrowing career in the US Air Force in his autobiography 'Viper Pilot: A Memoir Of Air Combat.' Scroll down for video . Fighter: Dan Hampton, author of Viper Pilot: A Memoir of Air Combat, in front of an F-16 fighter plane . During . his tours of duty, he witnessed first-hand some of the most historical . moments of the U.S. armed services, including helping to hunt down . Saddam Hussein during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. From 1986 to 2006, Hampton flew missions as a leading member of the Wild . Weasels, an elite Air Force fighter squadron whose mission is widely accepted as . the most dangerous job in modern air combat. 'It was time for this story,' Hampton . said in a statement released by his publisher. 'No grand designs or . philosophical fluff - just an honest view of life and war from one . fighter cockpit.' In the 20 years Hapton spent as a pilot, he flew 151 combat . missions, made 21 hard kills on surface-to-air-missile sites, received . four . Distinguished Flying Crosses with Valor and one Purple Heart. Hampton writes about his experiences in the squadron, in which he piloted the first planes sent . into war zones, flying deep behind enemy lines purposely seeking to draw fire . from surface-to-air missiles and artillery. Hard at work: Hampton at the controls of his plane during his days in the U.S. Air Force . Lethal: The F-16 'Flying Falcon' is known to be one of the world's deadliest fighter jets . 'They must skillfully evade being . shot down and then return to destroy the threats, thereby making the skies safe . for everyone else to follow,' reads the release. 'Today these vital missions are more hazardous than . direct air-to-air engagement with enemy aircraft.' Hampton's record number of . strikes on high-value targets make him the most lethal Wild Weasel pilot in . American history. Hampton logged twenty years and . more than 600 combat hours in the world's most iconic fighter jet: the F-16 'Fighting . Falcon' - or the 'Viper', as pilots call it. Hampton helped spearhead the 2003 invasion . of Iraq, leading the first flight of fighters over the border en route to strike . Baghdad. Among his targets were Saddam Hussein's suspected hide-out and his escape helicopters, which he personally destroyed. Legend: The pilot racked up 20 years, 151 combat missions, 21 kills, 12 medals and one Purple Heart . He shares stories . from Iraq of saving ground soldiers from certain death, evading . heat-seeking missiles locked on his tail, and of being wounded in a . terrorist attack. The . retired pilot also relives the morning of 9/11 when he and his F-16 took . to the skies above the United States and played a crucial role . in the unprecedented act of closing America’s airspace. Hampton, under . orders to shoot down any plane that did not identify itself, helped . escort a Delta Airlines flight to the ground that day. But given the paranoid atmosphere of that terrible day, he writes, 'we were fortunate that no one got shot down.' He . adds: 'It always surprises me how bloodthirsty the ground-pounders seem . to be. One controller told me that he'd ""give me clearance to fire..."" - . all I had to do was ask.' Memoir: Hampton has recounted many of his most memorable experiences in his autobiography . Hampton . was also responsible for calming down an over-excited air traffic . controller in Charlotte, North Carolina who declared a 'free-fire zone' for 20 miles around the city in response to a helicopter with its lights . out landing men on the ground. The . quick-thinking captain soon realised that the chopper had probably been . sent out by the Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg, and ordered a . colleague to contact the base to ensure that the Air Force did not . accidentally shoot down U.S. troops. Hampton also reveals what it takes psychologically to have 'the . right stuff'. The author's memoir is already getting early praise. 'Hampton . is not shy about recounting brushes with death,' read a Kirkus review. 'The author concentrates on the fighting and does a fine job . communicating the camaraderie and hair-raising incidents of service in . the elite macho fraternity of American fighter pilots.'

"Striking 17th Century Petworth House sits in a majestic 700-acre Capability Brown landscaped estate in the heart of Sussex's rolling South Downs. If it looks as pretty as a picture or like something out of a film, it's because it's both. Renowned landscape artist J. M. W. Turner was a frequent visitor to Petworth in the 1800s, and a number of his acclaimed paintings are of the stately home and surrounding countryside. Tipped to win awards: The new biopic of JMW Turner, starring Timothy Spall, has received rave reviews . Now the house features in several scenes in the movie Mr Turner, starring Timothy Spall. The National Trust-owned property is spectacular, not only because of its grand appearance (the building was given a Versailles-inspired makeover in 1688), but because it houses one of Britain's most important art collections outside London. I walk open-mouthed through the North Gallery, which is jammed with iconic works by van Dyck, Bosch, Reynolds, Blake and Flaxman and, of course, Turner. Petworth House owns 20 Turners - mostly commissioned in the 1800s by then-owner the 3rd Earl of Egremont, a patron of the arts who encouraged painters such as Constable and Turner to make Petworth their home. Stepping into the Old Library, which Turner used as a studio, light streams in through huge double-height windows that offer views across the lake, grassland and deer grazing around old oak and lime trees. A leafy corner of the English countryside: Turner painted extensively at Petworth House in West Sussex . I had reached Petworth after an easy 3.6-mile hike from the pretty hamlet of Lodsworth, strolling beneath a green canopy of oak, chestnut and holly. This area doesn't only fire the imagination, it also produces excellent wines. Nutbourne is a family-run winery ten miles from Petworth. The site is exquisite. On the balcony of its 19th Century windmill, we sipped delicious sparkling wine, a nutty 2010 Brut voted best UK wine 2013, and marvelled at the sight of vines stretching to the horizon, golden-brown leaves glowing like sunflowers. It was easy to see how these picturesque valleys and endless skies inspired Mr Turner. The Mr Turner exhibition at Petworth House runs from January 10 to March 11, 2015. Entry is included in the general admission price. Visit www.national trust.org.uk/petworth-house. HF Holidays (www.hfholidays.co.uk) offers a variety of walking holidays, including the Country House Escape at Abingworth (ten miles from Petworth), with accommodation at Abingworth Hall, guided walks on the South Downs Way and visits to Petworth.

"Gut bacteria may be responsible for thousands of heart attacks - particularly in people who have no obvious risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol. Scientists have discovered that certain gut flora turn a nutrient found in egg yolks, liver, beef, pork, pork and wheatgerm into the compound Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). TMAO makes blood cholesterol build up on artery walls, causing hardening of the arteries. If this buildup breaks away and blocks an artery, it usually results in a stroke or heart attack. The study found that organisms in our gut may be responsible for converting some foods into toxic chemicals . The new study built on a 2011 research on lab mice. Carried out by the Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute, scientists asked 40 healthy adults to eat two hard-boiled eggs, which are rich in a fatty substance called lecithin. After eating the eggs, the blood levels of TMAO became raised. But if participants took antibiotics - which kill bacteria in the gut - before eating the eggs, their TMAO levels were suppressed, the researchers found. ‘This showed that intestinal bacteria are essential for forming TMAO,’ Dr. Stanley Hazen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, told Reuters. Next, to see whether TMAO predicts cardiovascular events, the researchers measured its levels in 4,007 heart patients. After taking age and a past heart . attacks into account, they found that high levels of TMAO were . predictive of heart attack, stroke and death over the three years that . the patients were followed. Participants who had a heart attack, stroke or died during the study had higher than average TMAO levels than those who didn't. In fact, those who possessed the highest . TMAO levels had more than twice the risk of a heart attack or stroke . compared to people in the bottom quartile. The study asked volunteers to eat eggs, which contain high levels of lethicin, a precursor to harmful TMAO . And even people with high TMAO levels and no cardiovascular risk factors were 1.8 times more likely to experience a cardiovascular event than those with low levels. The findings suggest TMAO could serve as a marker for predicting heart disease although more studies are required to confirm the link, said the paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine. If the findings are confirmed, it is hoped that researchers will be able to develop a drug that blocks the production of TMAO. Earlier this month, the same researchers published a study that found a link between consumption of a chemical called carnitine, which is found in red meat, and a risk of heart disease. Carnitine is also converted by bacteria to TMAO. The study joins a growing list of findings that link microbes in the gut, nose and genital tract, and on the skin to health and disease. Research has shown that certain species of gut bacteria protect against asthma while others affect the risk of obesity. Last week scientists reported that circumcision alters bacteria in the penis, and that this helps protect men from sexually transmitted disease.","Study has found that bugs in gut are responsible for converting food into harmful compound called TMAO .

"Raised levels of a chemical linked to cancer have been found in a range of foods from KFC meals to breakfast cereals. Food watchdogs identified the increased quantities of acrylamide in 14 popular products. The chemical is formed when foods are roasted, toasted or fried at very high temperatures. Worrying: The foods with raised levels of the cancer risk chemical acrylamide . Scientists say it is potentially carcinogenic if consumed regularly over a lifetime. The Food Standards Agency tested 300 products to understand the scale of the problem. The largest amount was found in crisps, including a number of expensive brands such as Burts Sea Salted crisps. Exposure: The largest amount of the chemical was found in crisps, such as Seabrook's Sea Salted . There were also raised levels in Tesco ready salted crisps, Tayto cheese and onion crisps, Seabrook Sea Salted crisps, Pipers Anglesey sea salt crisps and the Co-op’s Sea Salt and Chardonnay crisps. Manufacturers suggested the problem was caused by last year’s bad weather which changed sugar levels in potatoes, which in turn created more acrylamide. In terms of take-out food, raised levels were found in a sample of KFC fries bought at a restaurant in Congleton, Cheshire, and a fish and chip shop in the town. Breakfast cereals containing bran, which is cooked at a particularly high temperature, also contained more acrylamide. Raised levels were found in Tesco bran flakes, Sainsbury’s wholegrain bran flakes, the Co-op’s wheat bran flakes and puffed wheat sold by the Good Grain Company. Higher than expected levels were also found in Fox’s Ginger biscuits and TUC biscuits. The FSA stresses it does not consider the levels of the chemical found to be dangerous, however it is keen that they are brought down as a precautionary measure. A spokesman said: ‘We will work with the relevant local authority to encourage food manufacturers to review their acrylamide reduction strategies.’ The watchdog said there is no need for the public to give up the foods named in its survey, however it gave advice on how people can reduce exposure. This includes cooking chips only to a light golden colour while advising that ‘bread should be toasted to the lightest colour acceptable’. Danger: The chemical is formed when foods are roasted, toasted or fried at very high temperatures as in TUC Original biscuits . It said manufacturers’ instructions for frying or oven-heating foods, such as chips, should be  followed carefully. The FSA also tested the products for the presence of a second type of cancer risk chemical called furan. No official safety limit exists for the chemical, however higher levels were found in roast coffee and popcorn. KFC said it has contacted all of its outlets to ensure cooking methods are designed to guarantee low acrylamide levels. It added: ‘We believe that this  was a one–off anomalous result as the levels in every other test carried out on KFC fries were significantly lower.’ Burt’s said the wet weather had changed the character of potatoes to create higher levels of the unwanted chemical. As a result, it is switching to new varieties that should reduce the level and is improving its  sorting process to remove overcooked crisps. Tesco said: ‘Food safety is incredibly important to us, and we are working closely with our suppliers to ensure all acrylamide levels are below the recommended indicative value.’","Watchdogs identified potentially dangerous acrylamide in 14 products .

"Drinking two cups of coffee a day could stop breast cancer recurring in recovering patients, new research has revealed. Combined with the anti-cancer drug tamoxifen, coffee could halve the rate of recurrence of breast cancer, scientists have discovered. Researchers at Lund University in Sweden believe that coffee actually boosts the effect of the drug. Drinking two cups of coffee a day could stop breast cancer recurring in recovering patients . They looked at 600 breast cancer patients from southern Sweden over a five year period. About 300 of them took tamoxifen - a drug commonly prescribed after breast cancer surgery. Tamoxifen is an anti-oestrogen drug that is widely used to treat breast cancer. Many breast cancers rely on the female sex hormone oestrogen to grow. Hormone-positive breast cancer cells have proteins which oestrogen attaches too. When it comes into contact with these proteins it fits into them and stimulates the cancer cells to divide so that the tumour grows. Tamoxifen works by fitting into the oestrogen receptors and blocking the hormone from reaching the cancer cells. This means the tumour either grows more slowly or stops growing altogether. Combined with the anti-cancer drug tamoxifen, coffee could halve the rate of breast cancer recurrence . Maria Simonsson, a doctoral student in Oncology at Lund University said: ‘Patients who took the pill, along with two or more cups of coffee daily, reported less than half the rate of cancer recurrence, compared with their non-coffee drinking, tamoxifen-taking counterparts. ‘How coffee interacts with the treatment, however, isn't immediately known. ‘One theory we are working with is that coffee “activates” tamoxifen and makes it more efficient.’ The Lund University researchers have previously linked coffee consumption to a decreased risk of developing certain types of breast cancer. Caffeine has also been shown to hamper the growth of cancer cells. The latest observational study involving coffee's role in cancer prevention and treatment underlines the need for more research, according to the team. Helena Jernstrvm, Associate Professor of Experimental Oncology at Lund University added: ‘We would like to know more about how lifestyle can interact with breast cancer treatment.’ This is not the first study to link coffee consumption with improved cancer prognosis. Scientists at Harvard Medical School have found that women who drink three or more cups of coffee a day have a 20 per cent lower risk of developing the most common form of skin cancer compared to those who had less than one cup per month. They also found that men who drank the same amount saw a nine per cent lower risk of the skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma.","With tamoxifen, coffee could halve the rate of breast cancer recurrence .

According to KFSN, the student was charged with sexually assaulting an animal and has since been released. The animal, which campus officials say is one of many used for breeding in the ag program, was treated by veterinarians. Student Marisa Burkdoll, whose job it is to take care of the animals at the sheep unit, told KFSN she first heard of the incident through social media and could not have been more horrified. 'It's just kind of disgusting and revolting and personally makes me angry, I mean why would you do that?' she told KFSN. Burkdoll has called for the student to be thrown in jail. Other students, by way of a Twitter account that has appeared in the sheep's name, have called for the student's expulsion. The parody account, @FresnoStSheep, has quickly become a place for students of the university of around 23,000 students to express shock and crack jokes about the incident.","The unnamed 23-year-old suspect is a student at Fresno State University in California .

"A Muslim man from Uganda who went to terror training camps in England cannot be deported because it is against his human rights. Lawyers argued that 30-year-old YM, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has weak ties to his homeland and his removal would breach his rights to a family life despite committing serious criminal offences. The man, who has been convicted of aggravated burglary among other charges, won his appeal against immediate removal back to Uganda by three senior judges at The Court of Appeal today. Judges at The Court of Appeal ruled that the man, known only as YM, cannot be deported due to human rights . Lord Justice Aikens, Sir Colin Rimer and Sir Stanley Burnton ruled that YM – a married father-of-three – was entitled to have his case reconsidered by tribunal. Sir Stanley said: ‘It would in general be difficult to see that in the case of someone who had committed offences as serious as those of the appellant the lack of ties to his country of nationality would lead to a breach of his Article 8 rights, since the public interest in his deportation is so strong.’ But the judge added that he was persuaded in this case to remit his appeal to the Upper Tribunal (UT) because of changes to relevant legislation and Immigration Rules since his case was last considered. Lord Justice Aikens described how YM began to seriously practise Islam - the religion of his birth - whilst detained at a youth offender institution. After his release on licence in 2005 he used to attend the Croydon Mosque, and that led him to go to meetings at the house of a man called Hamid ‘whom YM subsequently admitted was a fanatical Islamist’, said the judge. ‘These encounters resulted in YM attending two terrorist training camps [in southern England] in 2006.’ Born in Uganda in June 1984, YM came to the UK with his mother and her other children in 1991 at the age of six. He obtained indefinite leave to remain when he was 16. Lord Justice Aikens said: ‘His mother and siblings have obtained British nationality, but YM has not. ‘That is because he started to commit crimes when he was 14, his age when he was convicted of robbery.’ He was subsequently convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm when he was 15, three assaults on police constables when he was aged 18, and aggravated burglary when 19. Sir Stanley Burnton (pictured) said he had been 'persuaded' in this case to remit his appeal . For the burglary offence he was sentenced at Croydon Crown Court in September 2003 to three years, six months in a youth offender institution. He was warned in a letter from the then home secretary that ‘a serious view’ was taken of the aggravated burglary offence and he was at risk of being deported if he was the subject of ‘adverse notice’ in the future. On the day of his release in March 2005 he married his wife in an Islamic wedding ceremony and the couple have gone on to have three children. After a visit to the house of the ‘fanatical Islamist’ and attending terrorist training camps he was arrested. YM was charged under section 8(2)(a) of the 2006 Terrorism Act which makes it an offence to attend a place where instruction or training, including with weapons, is given for terrorist purposes. He pleaded guilty to two charges and in February 2008 at Woolwich Crown Court was sentenced to three years, five months in prison on each count, with the sentences running concurrently. But because YM had been in custody since his arrest, he was released on licence in June 2008. The judge said that a month earlier he had been served with a deportation notice by the Home Secretary, stating that his presence in the UK was ‘not conducive to the public good’ because of his terrorist-related convictions. An Immigration and Appeal Tribunal (IAT) allowed YM’s initial appeal against the notice on human rights grounds in July 2009, but the decision was overturned by the Upper Tribunal (UT) and a fresh hearing ordered. In May 2013, the UT heard evidence from YM and his wife and the mothers of the couple but rejected assertions that there was a real risk he would suffer inhuman and degrading treatment if sent back to Uganda, contrary to Article 3 of the human rights convention. Although the appeal judges dismissed his challenge to the decision under Article 3, they ruled he was entitled to a rehearing by the tribunal on his Article 8 grounds. Lord Justice Aikens said the Article 8 case raised issues over how revised Immigraton Rules were to be applied to YM’s case, but the central question for the court was what ties YM himself had with Uganda and whether they would support him if he was returned to that country. He declared the UT had made three relevant errors of law on the issue and must now ‘conduct a proper factual enquiry and evaluation’ of those ties in the light of the new 2014 Immigration Rules. An Al-Qaeda terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, pictured in 2001 . In the court’s written judgment, the judge described how YM was involved in continuing clashes with the law after the IAT allowed his initial appeal against deportation in July 2009. But the judge said the UT was correct to point out that he had not engaged in any terrorist activity since his release from prison in 2008, and there was no evidence that he was likely to in the future ‘whether in the UK or in Uganda’. In August 2009 he was warned for contacting a co-defendant to the terrorist charges, with non-contact being a condition of being freed from prison on licence. The judge said he was recalled to prison in December 2009 at the same time as being arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods, although that charge was not pursued. In January 2010 he was released on licence. In October 2011 he was given a caution for a ‘road rage’ incident. Then in June 2012 he was arrested on a charge in connection with motor insurance fraud, subsequently pleaded guilty and given a 12-month community supervision order and a 12-month driving ban.","Lawyers argued that 30-year-old YM has 'weak ties to his homeland'

"Letters containing the conclusions of the Chilcot Inquiry have been sent to the main participants, including Tony Blair, the Daily Mail understands . Letters containing the detailed conclusions of the public inquiry into the Iraq War have been sent to the main participants, the Daily Mail understands. The revelation will increase speculation that the conclusions of the long-delayed inquiry could be made public in the coming months. Tony Blair and Jack Straw are among those thought to have received letters in recent weeks warning them of any criticisms to be made by Sir John Chilcot. Whitehall sources have told the Mail the letters were sent out ‘some time ago’. In May David Cameron said he expected the report to be published ‘before the end of the year’. He added: ‘The public wants to see the answers of the inquiry and I think we shouldn’t have to wait too much longer.’ But just four weeks of the Parliamentary term remain – making it unlikely that it will be published before MPs recess for Christmas. By law, anyone who will face criticism of a public inquiry must be sent a letter warning them of the contents. They are then permitted to challenge any negative findings. These so-called ‘Maxwellisation’ letters are the result of a court challenge by Robert Maxwell who overturned the verdict of a critical report in 1969. Legal wrangling between participants who want to challenge any personal criticisms contained in the report could cause further delay. Senior Labour figures will fear the publication of the inquiry’s conclusions in the run up to the election, knowing it will remind the public of the divisive conflict and re-open old wounds within the party. First launched by Gordon Brown in July 2009, the Chilcot inquiry began its hearings in November that year and finished taking formal evidence in 2011. But lengthy delays were caused by arguments between Sir John Chilcot, the inquiry’s chairman and the US and British governments over the publication of correspondence between Mr Blair and President George W Bush. Earlier this year there were claims of a whitewash after Sir John confirmed his long-awaited report would publish only ‘the gist’ and some quotes of Mr Blair’s messages to Mr Bush. The US president’s replies will not be published in any form. Sir John said this was vital in order for people to understand the inquiry’s conclusions. Families of servicemen killed in the Iraq conflict condemned the decision not to publish the documents in full. The report has been hit with delays because of arguments over whether correspondence between Blair and President George Bush should be included in full . They said it meant they might never learn the full truth about the decision to go to war. Earlier this year Mr Blair insisted he was not the reason for the delay in publishing the report. The former prime minister said he resented suggestions that he was holding it up. He said the ‘sooner it is published the better’. ‘I have got as much interest as anyone in seeing the inquiry publish its findings and then being able to go out and frankly restate my case and defend my position,’ Mr Blair said. Figures released in recent weeks show the cost of the inquiry is set to top £11million. Senior figures, including Mr Blair, are expected to have their legal bills for the inquiry paid by the taxpayer. Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker, a critic of the war, said the report should be published ‘as soon as possible’. ‘This has gone on long enough. People have a right to know when they vote in May about the roles of those involved in taking Britain to war.’ ‘People may argue it is political to publish it before May, but I would argue it would be political not to do so.’ A spokesman for the Chilcot inquiry declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr Blair’s office said: ‘No comment’. Mr Straw could not be reached for comment.","Tony Blair is thought to have seen the findings of the Iraq War Inquiry .

"A farmer was killed after being knocked over and eaten alive by his hogs, authorities said. Terry Vance Garner, 69, had gone to feed the herd on his Oregon ranch at 7.30am last Wednesday and never returned. A family member later found Garner’s . dentures and pieces of his body scattered throughout the hog enclosure, but most of his . remains had been consumed. Grisly: The body parts of Terry Vance Garner were found in the hog enclosure at his remote Oregon farm by a relative . The Coos County district attorney’s office said in a statement on Monday that it’s possible Garner had a medical emergency, such as a heart attack, or was knocked over by the animals before he was killed. However criminal activity has not been ruled out and an investigation was ongoing. ‘For all we know, it was a horrific . accident, but it's so doggone weird that we have to look at all . possibilities,’ Coos County District Attorney Paul Frasier told The . Register-Guard. Some of the hogs weighed an abnormally large 700 pounds on the farm close to the rural town of Riverton. Most hogs are raised to a market weight of between 250-300lbs. Animal lover: The victim's brother said that beside pigs, Garner had turkeys and other types of birds on his farm . The DA’s office said at least one hog had either bitten or been aggressive with Mr Garner in the past. A pathologist was unable to identify a . cause or manner of death, the newspaper reported. The remains will be . examined by a forensic anthropologist at the University of Oregon. Michael Garner, 75, the deceased's older brother, told The Register-Guard that his sibling was ‘a good-hearted guy’ who cared for several huge adult sows and a boar named Teddy. Piglets were typically sold to local 4-H kids. Vicious: Some of the hogs on Mr Garner's farm weighed up to 700lb . The victim's brother added that the 69-year-old man was a Vietnam veteran who suffered post-traumatic stress and that his life had been turned around by living on the farm. ‘Those animals were his life,’ Michael Garner said. ‘He had all kinds of birds, and turkeys that ran all over the place. Everybody knew him.’ Michael Garner said one of the large sows bit his brother last year when he accidentally stepped on a piglet. Dangerous precedent: A pig once bit the 69-year-old farmer, but Garner decided not to kill the animal . ‘He said he was going to kill it, but when I asked him about it later, he said he had changed his mind,’ the brother said. Domestic hogs are not typically known to be as aggressive as their feral cousins, but ‘there is some degree of danger associated with any animal,’ John Killefer, who heads the Animal and Rangeland . Sciences Department at Oregon State University in Corvallis, told the newspaper.While pigs ‘are more omnivorous than other farm animals, (such as) cows,’ Killefer called the case highly unusual. Most hogs are raised until they reach a market weight of between 250 and 300 pounds, while breeding female pigs rarely weigh more than 400 pounds, Killefer said.","Terry Vance Garner discovered in hog enclosure at his remote Oregon farm by a relative .

"Barack Obama's top strategist said that the campaign will take a 'hard look' at how to approach future debates in the light of last night's failure - and appealed to the media to challenge Mitt Romney on the issues which the President avoided in Denver. All but stating that the Republican had won the debate, David Axelrod conceded that the performance aspect was 'not the President's strong suit in these events' but insisted that 'I don't see us adding huge amounts of additional prep time.' The remarks came after the Obama campaign was left reeling by Mr Romney's knockout performance in the candidates' first head-to-head clash, with polls suggesting that voters regarded the former governor of Massachusetts as the debate winner by a margin of more than two to one. Scroll down for video . Contrast: Mitt Romney was all smiles on his campaign plane, while Barack Obama looked determined in Denver . Celebration? Romney chuckles with senior adviser Bob White as they wait to take off from Denver airport . Good humour: The Republican candidate clearly needed no cheering up on his campaign plane . Democratic strategists are now fighting to preserve the narrow poll lead which Mr Obama enjoyed in the run-up to the debate, as fired-up Republicans aim to capitalise on the primetime thrashing and entrench the image of Mr Romney as a potential President. Mr Axelrod, speaking on a campaign conference call, made an appeal to reporters to make the points that Obama himself had failed to make in the debate . 'All of you who travel on the road with Governor Romney know that he just few weeks ago stood up and said we didn't need any more teachers,' he said. 'Last night he couldn't be more enthusiastic about teachers and more teachers.' Mr Romney had delivered 'a very vigorous performance but one that was devoid of honesty', Mr Axelrod said. 'And so today, as the day after, I think the question for you [the media], for the American people is really one of character and whether or not a candidacy that's so fundamentally rooted in hiding the truth and the facts from the American people and deception is the basis of trust on which you assign the presidency to a person. 'So that is what we are going to focus on moving forward. We're going to hold Governor Romney accountable for the things that he said last night and we're going to make him justify those claims - as I hope you will make him justify those claims. 'Because we need an an honest and a genuine and realistic plan to move forward and not a bunch of lines designed to get you through a debate.' The day after: Obama began his quest to resurrect his campaign in Denver with a speech to supporters after the disappointing debate . The day after: Obama used the term 'economic patriotism' again on Thursday in remarks during a campaign event in Denver . Mr Axelrod said that Mr Romney was 'completely untethered from the truth' and 'knowingly and willfully tried to deceive senior citizens' Referring to post-debate polls, he added: 'People are willing to give Governor Romney credit for his performance but that didn't necessarily translate into support for him for President. He may win the Oscar for his performance last night but he’s not going to win the presidency for his performance last night.' He signalled that there would be changes to Mr Obama's approach to the second debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on October 16th. 'He made a choice last night to answer the questions that were asked and to talk to the American people about what we need to do to move forward and to not get into serial fact checking with Governor Romney, which can be an exhausting never ending pursuit. 'But obviously moving forward we're going to take a hard look at this and we're going to have to make some judgements as to where to draw the line in these debates and how to use our time. 'In terms of changes... it's like a play-offs in sports, you evaluate after every contest and you make adjustments and I'm sure that we will make adjustments. I think there will be some strategic judgements that will have to be made and we'll make them.' Admission: David Axelrod confessed to Mr Obama's weaknesses and asked the media to push Mr Romney harder . Speaking in Denver the day after the debate, Mr Obama took a more aggressive attitude, speaking loudly and assertively as he defended his record in front of a sympathetic crowd. 'We succeed when the middle class gets bigger,' he said. 'We succeed not from the top down but from the middle out.' The President also spoke about his energy policy, boasting of the progress his administration has made on renewable energy and adding: 'The United States of America today is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly two decades.' He also brought out the harsh words for Mr Romney which he had largely avoided the night before, saying: 'Governor Romney may dance around his positions, but if you want to be President, you owe the American people the truth.' Mr Obama continued: 'Governor Romney may dance around his positions, but if you want to be President, you owe the American people the truth.' The vocal audience provided a boost which the President was denied during the silent debate, notably when one fan shouted out: 'We believe in you!' Clash: More than 58 million people tuned in to the Obama-Romney debate, far more than the total who watched Obama-McCain in 2008. Contest: The debate was moderated by Jim Lehrer, who drew criticism for his passive demeanour . In the debate itself, however, it was Mr Romney who was on the offensive, shining in what was arguably the most high-profile . moment of his political career so far. The Republican challenger denounced . Mr Obama's performance over the past four years, and at one point . compared the President's behaviour to that of his sons when they were . children. ‘Look, I’ve got five boys,' he said. 'I’m used to people saying something that’s not always true, but just . keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I’ll believe it.’ From the outset of . the debate, Mr Romney chided Mr Obama for promising to halve America’s . annual deficit but instead doubling it and even compared him to a little . boy who can’t tell the truth. Hitting . Mr Obama with a blizzard of statistics, Mr Romney also hit back hard at . what he saw as the President mischaracterising his plans: ‘Virtually . everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.' Mr Romney was at the top of his game . from the outset, coming across as pithier and punchier than Mr Obama, . who seemed taken aback by being confronted so relentlessly and struggled . to speak concisely. Commiseration: Mr Obama hugs First Lady Michelle Obama at the conclusion of the showdown . Joy: Mr Romney was joined by several family members, including his wife Ann, up on stage in Denver . The challenger's dominance came . despite his having four minutes less talking time than the incumbent - . Mr Romney spoke for 38 minutes and 32 seconds, while Mr Obama held the . spotlight for 42 minutes and 50 seconds. A CNN poll of registered voters who . watched the debate reflected Mr Romney's perceived victory, as 67 per . cent of respondents regarded him as the night's winner compared to just . 25 per cent for Mr Obama. Additionally, 58 per cent thought . that the Republican came across as a stronger leader than the Democrat, . while twice as many said the evening had made them more likely to vote . for Mr Romney as said they were swayed towards the President. Conservative columnist Charles Hurt . wrote in the Washington Times that 'President Obama flailed all around . the debate stage', adding: 'It was like he had been called in front of . the principal after goofing around for four years and blowing off all . his homework.' He argued that the President looked . out of his depth compared to the self-assurance of Mr Romney, and said: . 'Who knew anyone on the planet could make Mitt Romney look easy, . relaxed, smooth and human?' Mr Hurt concluded: 'Not since Jimmy . Carter faced Ronald Reagan has the U.S. presidency been so . embarrassingly represented in public. Actually, that’s an insult to . Jimmy Carter.' Andrew Sullivan, a respected centrist . who is a strong supporter of the President, criticised Mr Obama's . 'meandering, weak, professorial arguments' on the Daily Beast. Comedian Bill Maher, who has donated . $1million to a Democratic super-PAC, expressed frustration over Mr . Obama's lacklustre performance in a series of acid tweets throughout the . debate. At one point, he said: 'Romney looks . more confident and energetic - he's about a minute away from holding . Obama down and cutting his hair.'","Mitt Romney revels in aftermath of crushing debate victory .

"A memoir when you're still a teenager may seem premature, but not for Mo'ne Davis, the first female pitcher to win a Little League World Series game. 'Mo'ne Davis: Remember My Name' will be released next March by HarperCollins Children's Books, the publisher told The Associated Press on Monday. The honor roll student from Philadelphia became a sensation last summer after leading the Taney Dragons to a 4-0 victory over Nashville, when she was just 13. Known for her long braids and uncommon poise, she has since appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, thrown out the first pitch at a major league World Series game and starred in a car commercial directed by Spike Lee. In September, she even donated her jersey to the baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. Cover: 'Mo'ne Davis: Remember My Name' will be released on March 17 . 'When I joined an all-boys baseball team, my mom wasn't too happy,' Mo'ne said in a statement issued Monday through HarperCollins. 'I proved to her (and to me) that I could do anything I set my mind to. I'm just a girl that likes to play sports and I'm excited to share my story with everyone,' she said. Davis also said 'I hope it encourages people to take a chance and play the sports they want to play and not just the ones people expect them to play.' In August, Davis told ESPN '[Baseball] isn't my favorite sport. It's just that I don't really go anywhere for basketball because I don't play AAU and there's no time in the summer for me to play basketball. But I like basketball more than this.' She also said 'Follow your dream. Yeah, follow your dream and don't let anyone else tell you that you can't do something.' Davis also told the sports network that month 'I want to go to UConn and be the point guard on the team. That's like my dream and then go into the WNBA. That's for [head coach Geno Auriemma]. Geno has to know.' Later this month, she and her fellow Taney Dragons will help kick off the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Financial terms for the book deal were not disclosed. Author Hilary Beard, whose previous collaborations include 'Promises Kept: Raising Black Boys to Succeed in School and in Life,' will assist Davis with her memoir.

One of the attacks saw a woman surrounded by dozens of men who, tore off her clothes, beat and kicked her in the genitals.

"An unprecedented number of children are being prescribed strong anti-psychotic medication, sometimes by doctors who have little experience in dealing with child psychiatric experience. New figures revealed by the ABC show that more than 100,000 scripts were written for children around Australian for such medications in the past year. In Queensland the figures were highest with 645 in 100,000 children on a form of anti-psychotic, according to statistic from the year 2013. NSW had the second highest rate, followed by the ACT and Victoria. Figures were lower in West Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Tasmania. New figures have revealed that young more than 100,000 Australian children have been prescribed anti-psychotic medication . In 2012, the Australian Federal Government estimated that at least 12,000 children were on anti-psychotic medication, the ABC reported, but that figure appears to be much higher now. Risperidone, Quetiapine and Olanzapine are the three most commonly prescribed medicines. Such medications are primarily used to treat conditions like bipolar and schizophrenia which don't emerge until the late teenage years, but these are increasingly being used to control some symptoms of autism or kids who exhibit particularly aggressive behaviour. Child psychiatrist Jon Jureidini has criticised the overuse of such medications, saying that more children are prescribed with anti-psychotic medication than the number of them who actually suffer from psychotic disorders. One doctor said an alarming number of children in foster care are being prescribed anti-psychotic medication for behavioural problems . 'We should make no mistake about these drugs – they are dangerous drugs,' he said, adding that they can cause many side-effects including weight gain. He added that an alarming number of children in foster care are being prescribed anti-psychotic medication for behavioural problems. 'I think we have to face up to the fact that children in foster care are being inappropriately overmedicated,' Dr Jureidini said. Dr Jureidini also said there is little evidence to support the use of such medications are safe in young children, and described their use as largely experimental. He urged people to seek alternative treatment like psychology before reaching for potentially harmful medications.","In 2013 more than 100,000 Australian children were given prescriptions for anti-psychotic medications .

"Four police officers involved in the fatal pursuit of a young student used 'unnecessary, excessive and unlawful force' against him, a court has heard. Brazilian student Roberto Curti, 21, died in the early hours of March 18, 2012, after a chase and violent struggle with police in Sydney's CBD in which he was tasered, handcuffed, hit with capsicum spray and knelt on. Policemen Scott James Edmondson and Daniel David Barling have been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm while Chin Aun Lim and Damian John Ralph face the charge of assault. All four have pleaded not guilty. Brazilian student Roberto Curti died in the early hours of March 18, 2012, following a chase and violent struggle with police in which he was Tasered, handcuffed, hit with capsicum spray and knelt on . A court heard on Monday that the four police officers involved used 'unnecessary, excessive and unlawful force' against Mr Curti . On the opening day of a four-week hearing, prosecutor Cate Dodds on Monday said Mr Curti became increasingly afraid and erratic after taking the drug LSD with two friends on the night of March 17, 2012. By the early hours of the morning, Mr Curti was seen running around the city before going to a convenience store and stealing two packets of Tim Tams. After a triple zero call, police initially described the biscuit theft over the radio as an armed robbery involving two men. Policemen Scott James Edmondson (left) and Daniel David Barling (right) pictured earlier this month have been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm . Mr Curti was eventually spotted by police who began chasing him along Pitt Street at about 6am. He was dressed in blue jeans and had no shirt and no shoes on. When police caught him, Ms Dodds said Lim successfully deployed his Taser at Mr Curti causing him to fall to the ground. What happened next, she said was 'unnecessary, excessive and unlawful'. As Mr Curti lay handcuffed on the ground, surrounded by cops, Lim discharged his Taser for a second time. Chin Aun Lim (left) and Damian John Ralph (right) face the charge of assault . Meanwhile Barling, the court heard, used the Taser's 'drive-stun mode' on five separate occasions, while Edmondson used his twice. Mr Curti was also hit with capsicum spray by Ralph, Ms Dodds said. The cause of Mr Curti's death is undetermined but he was unable to be resuscitated at the scene. The hearing continues on Tuesday. Earlier this month the four police officers were seeking to permanently halt criminal proceedings against them. In a hearing in the first week of November, Barrister Bret Walker SC told Downing Centre Local Court they were now making an application to stay the proceedings against them. All four have pleaded not guilty and earlier this month were trying to halt all criminal proceedings against them . Barrister Bret Walker SC told the court, the prosecution case against the four police officer including Scott Edmondson (pictured) was 'rooted in an eradicable error' The prosecution case against the four had been tainted by directed interviews which took place in the days after Mr Curti's death, Mr Walker said. During the interviews, officers were 'compelled' to answer questions by threat of disciplinary action and therefore their answers should not have been used against them. Instead, Mr Walker argued, the interviews became 'inextricably entangled' in the ensuing investigation of them. This meant the prosecution case was 'rooted in an eradicable error', he said. The hearing commenced on Monday and will run for the next four weeks.  Chin Aun Lim is pictured here a fortnight ago . But Crown Advocate Natalie Adams SC, appearing on behalf of the attorney-general, said only three pages of Lim's interview had ever been handed to the DPP. If the admissibility of the interviews was in question, Ms Adams said there should be an application for that evidence to be excluded. 'This is not a basis for a stay,' she said, adding that should be a 'last resort'. Magistrate Mark Buscombe will hand down his decision on the permanent stay application by the four police officers on November 11.

"Barwala resembles a fortress as thousands of security personnel brace for a possible showdown with the disciples of self-styled godman Sant Rampal. The stand-off comes as the deadline for Rampal to appear in a contempt case ended on Monday morning. Nearly 60,000 disciples, including women and children, have formed a human wall outside the Satlok Ashram at Barwala town in Haryana’s Hisar district. The stand-off bears the echoes of a similar case involving another godman. Armed and angry: Police say the godman's supporters are carrying traditional as well as modern firearms . Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who faces rape and murder charges, never makes a personal appearance in court, giving his statements via video-conferencing instead. In this he enjoys the support of the Haryana Police, who insist that Gurmeet be allowed the privilege. Returning to Rampal, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had earlier pulled up the Haryana officials after they failed to produce the guru. The officials cited resistance by the godman’s followers for their inability to present him in court. A large number of cars and SUVs are parked outside the ashram situated on the Hisar-Chandigarh road. Spread over 12 acres, the ashram is now dotted with pandals set up to shelter the godman’s followers from across the country. Standing firm: The human wall outside the ashram includes multitudes of women and children . “They (the supporters) are armed with traditional as well as modern firearms inside the premises. Many of the firearms are illegal. The followers are chanting the godman’s name to make their presence felt…,” a DSP rank police officer said. Sant Rampal, now revered by thousands, was born Rampal Dass to a family of farmers in Sonepat district’s Thanana village . Besides several thousand personnel of the Haryana Police, 10 battalions of CRPF and 14 battalions of RAF have cordoned off the entire area. The security personnel have already barricaded the two sides of the road nearly one km away from the ashram. No private vehicles, including those of the media, are being permitted to go towards the ashram. The local administration has cut water and electricity connections to the Satlok Ashram. It has also ordered a three-day shut-down of schools near the ashram, while local hospitals have been put on high alert. Meanwhile, pamphlets have surfaced alleging that two judges of the Hisar civil court are responsible for the tense situation prevailing from November 10. One way of defusing the situation could be for the court to permit Rampal to appear before it via video conference, Satlok Ashram spokesperson Raj Kapoor says. “Sant Rampal is undergoing treatment for severe pain in the heart. He is not able to travel and, hence, it is not possible for him to appear in court,” he said. The spokesperson adds that Rampal has no issue with the court. “He is a man of principles. He only has concern with the two judges who took cognisance of contempt of court against him on July 22…,” Kapoor claims. The law facilitates everyone to put his point of view before court, Kapoor adds. “We have seen enough cases where courts have considered the request of concern persons, including accused, to appear before them via video conference. There is no conflict with the local police,” the spokesperson contends. Devendar Punia, a follower from Shahjahanpur, said the situation inside the ashram is deteriorating with every passing hour. “Inside the ashram, the followers are living on food stocks. The quality of water available in the ashram is big concern,” he added. Rampal's army defy state government . By Mail Today Bureau in Chandigarh . A resolution to the week-long stand-off between the Haryana authorities and supporters of godman Sant Rampal seems unlikely to come soon, as his arrest continues to remain an unacceptable option for his legions of followers. Despite Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s personal appeal to Rampal to appear in court, his followers have made it clear that they will - at best - allow him to attend hearings via video-conferencing. Besides several thousand Haryana Police personnel, 10 battalions of CRPF and 14 battalions of RAF have cordoned off the entire area round the ashram . Sources close to the state government said that two local BJP leaders, including Kalayat MLA Jaiprakash, as well as police officers had approached the Satlok Ashram with the request that they be allowed to take him into custody, but to no avail. “He is not feeling well and cannot travel. His appearance can be marked by video conferencing .We will follow the court’s directions,” Satlok Ashram spokesperson Raj Kapoor said. The authorities have so far adopted a gentle approach because they fear any move to forcibly arrest Rampal may result in violence, a prospect made all the more scary by the fact that the human chain around his ashram comprises multitudes of women and children. They are reportedly mulling the possibility of conducting the operation in the small hours of the day with the hope that they may not meet strong retaliation at that hour. Meanwhile, sources said the Intelligence Bureau has alerted the Haryana and Chandigarh Police about the possibility of “anti-social” elements manipulating the situation to sow disturbance. The alert reportedly suggests a suspicion that Maoists may mingle with Rampal’s supporters to spark violence. From 'careless' engineer to spiritual guru . By Manjeet Sehgal in Chandigarh . This is the story of how a government engineer became a spiritual guru with thousands in thrall to him. Speaking of modest beginnings, Sant Rampal’s is about as humble as it comes. The ‘godman’ was born Rampal Dass to a family of farmers in Sonepat district’s Thanana village on September 8, 1951. After school, he got a diploma in engineering and joined Haryana government’s irrigation and public health department as a junior engineer. At the age of 48, in May 2000, he was reportedly removed from the department for carelessness. By then, however, his life had already begun to change direction. Police personnel are seen outside Rampal's Rohtakashram in a photo from 2006, when a clash broke out between his followers and a group of Arya Samajis . A seer, Swami Ramdevanand, had taken him under his wing 18 years before. In 1999, Rampal established the Satlok Ashram in Rohtak district’s Karontha village. Before long, the ashram gained popularity and Rampal Dass began to court the title of ‘Sant’. He subsequently set up several ashrams across the state, including the one at Barwala, presenting himself as an incarnation of the 15th century mystic poet Kabir. His band of followers hit new heights. But the smooth run ended soon after. By 2000, he had run afoul of several Arya Samajis after he allegedly made derogatory remarks against the group’s founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati. In 2006, the differences between the two groups culminated in a clash that resulted in the death of one person. This is where Rampal’s tryst with the judiciary begins. Following the clash, Rampal was arrested on charges of murder and attempt to murder and his ashram at Karontha attached by the government. He was released on bail two years later, on April 30, 2008, after which he shifted his base to Hisar district’s Barwala town. In November 2010, the Punjab and Haryana High Court directed the Rohtak administration to hand the ashram back to Rampal. It was after the matter moved to the Supreme Court that the ashram was handed over to Rampal again on April 7, 2013. A month later, on May 12, clashes again erupted between a group of Arya Samajis and Rampal’s followers. Two people were killed and around 100 injured as the police opened fire and lathi-charged the warring groups to control the melee. In July this year, Rampal and his followers went on the rampage in a Hisar court where he was to appear for a murder conspiracy trial dating back to 2006. Since his release in 2010, Rampal, who faces contempt of court, murder and attempt to murder cases in various courts, has skipped hearings 42 times, which is why he now faces contempt charges. An arrest warrant was issued when he failed to heed court summons last week, and this is where the current stand-off began.","Self-styled godman Sant Rampal failed to appear on contempt of court charges .

It also included instructions on how to make a homemade 'Molotov Cocktail' and a diagram in the magazine read by boys and girls aged five to 15. How to make a Molotov Cocktail: The Qaws Quzah magazine article on petrol bombs included instructions and a diagram . Popular: Boys and girls aged between five and 15 read the magazine Qaws Quzah . The piece described a Molotov Cocktail as 'an improvised weapon that is often used in riots and acts of sabotage because it is easy to make and use'. Many were left outraged that the article was published in a children's magazine - particularly in a country still dealing with civil unrest after last year's revolution - the first to spark the Arab Spring. Tunisia's revolution led to the democratic election of a transitional government headed by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party but there are still many extremist religious groups using violent methods including petrol bombs. Lethal: A petrol bomb, pictured being used by a Palestinian protester in Ramallah, West Bank, earlier this year . Unrest: Riot police being pushed back by flames caused by a thrown Molotov Cocktail during violent demonstrations in Athens, Greece, last month . Uprising: Molotov cocktails being used by anti-government protesters in Bahrain last week . The Ministry for Women and Family Affairs said the article 'encourages violent and terrorist thought' as well as endangering children's lives by ""encouraging the use of Molotov cocktails in acts of vandalism or terrorism'. An investigation has now been launched into the magazine article and a case is likely to be brought against the publishers and all those involved in the issue. A judge will determine the actual charges the magazine will face but the ministry suggested they could include incitement to violence.","Qaws Quzah magazine - meaning Rainbow in .

"Still making money: Paedophile rock star Ian Watkins will continue to rake in thousands of pounds in performance royalties while behind bars for child sex offences . Paedophile rock star Ian Watkins will continue to rake in thousands of pounds in performance royalties while serving his prison sentence for child sex offences. The depraved former Lostprophets frontman is due to be sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court, south Wales, on Wednesday. But a music lawyer believes he could still pocket an estimated £100,000 in royalty cash generated since he was arrested and charged last year. His notoriety and renewed publicity when he is sentenced could even cause a cash generation spike as music sales and internet searches rise. Music lawyer Craig Brookes explained that as the band's lyricist, Watkins will be in line for a big cut of any fees generated. 'The . biggest income stream will almost certainly be publishing which, even . if radio play has stopped, will still be pretty big,' he told Wales on . Sunday. 'This is because PRS and their equivalents in different countries allocate money on a spot-check basis. 'So you're going to get money for plays in gyms and hairdressers and on juke boxes and all that stuff. 'They will say, ""This is how much music is in the market place so it is likely you are due this amount."". 'He will also get a publishing cut for any play Lostprophets have anywhere.' The 36-year-old, from Pontypridd, admitted two counts of attempted rape on the baby of one female fan on the eve of a trial in Cardiff last month. Watkins also admitted conspiracy to rape the baby of another female fan, sexually touching a one-year-old and possessing and making child porn. Famous: Rock star Watkins approached fans via the Lostprophets website before meeting young girls for sex . He also plotted sex abuse with the mothers of the babies in a series of text and internet messages. Both women, who cannot be named, will be sentenced with him. But fans around the world continue to . play Lostprophets music and video footage of the band remains popular on . internet sites such as YouTube. Sadly, the case and Watkins's notoriety could also be generating a substantial pick up in album sales for the band he fronted. 'The . records could be earning a substantial amount. It could easily have . translated to 100,000 or 200,000 extra sales,' Mr Brookes said. 'It . could be over £100,000 easily. It could be less, but there will be . another spike when he gets sentenced, in terms of money generated - . because of clips when the story breaks, then there will be a spike in . online activity. Prosecution: Cardiff Crown Court heard that Watkins was 'a determined and committed paedophile engaged in serious sex offences involving of two babies' 'And there are going to be PRS payments because the music is out there.' Revelations surrounding Watkins' secret life of planned child abuse and debauchery have continued to emerge since his admission in court. A former girlfriend has spoken publicly about the number of times she reported Watkins to the police after being horrified by his vile suggestions. Another woman has spoken out claiming Watkins wanted to have a baby with her that he planned to sexually abuse. Disgust at the depths of his depravity has seen him transformed from celebrated rock star to being universally reviled. As his artistic activities continue to be broadcast around the world, however, royalty payments collected by the Performing Rights Society (PRS) and others will keep flowing in. Guilty: Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins, in the dock at Cardiff Crown Court, admitted a string of child sex offences after a last minute plea change .","Ian Watkins, 36, will be sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court on Wednesday .

"With thousands of Chinese students resorting to 007-style gadgets such as pinhole cameras and radio transmitter bras to cheat in their exams, one college decided to take a stand. More than 3,800 students have been forced to sit their exams outside under the watchful eye of 80 invigilators who used HD cameras, binoculars and even perched on ladders for a better view. Teachers at Shaanxi Sanhe College in Baoji city of northwest China's Shaanxi province believe this will help cut down on the use of sophisticated cheating devices such as radio vests and transmitters hidden in bras. This is the tenth year the school has administered the great outdoor test, which helps determine the order in which students will be recommended to their prospective employers. Around 1,200 students will sit each exam at the sports ground and the results could have a significant impact on their future. Security staff in Jinlin, Jiangsu and Guangdong provinces revealed that students started using sophisticated radio vests in order to receive help from someone outside the hall. Pupils were also taking pictures of the tests using a button-hole camera hidden in a pen or watch, then using a copper antenna loop stitched into their clothing to beam it out of the hall to someone sitting with a receiver. Education is highly valued in China, with many parents sending their children miles each day just to go to school, and many are afraid they will be harshly punished for failure.

"The plant remedy contains aconite a herb once dubbed the 'Queen of Poisons' A herbal medicine used by alternative practitioners to treat migraines could be fatal. Zheng Tian Wan is unregulated but is available in the UK, and it has been linked to serious health complications and death, health authorities say. The plant remedy contains aconite – a herb once dubbed the ‘Queen of Poisons’ by the ancient Greeks - and could be toxic for the heart and nervous system. The ingredient is on a UK list of restricted herbal ingredients and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have issued a statement warning against using the product. The MHRA said the issue came to their attention after a herbal practitioner supplied a patient the unlicensed migraine pills, which have not been tested for safety and quality. The agency said it has previously received three reports of suspected side effects to aconite. One patient suffered kidney problems, a second was hospitalised after suffering dizziness and paraesthesia (pins and needles) and the third experienced palpitations, aches and pains with shortness of breath but recovered after stopping taking the product. Andrea Farmer, Herbal policy manager at the MHRA, said in certain circumstances herbal medicines could be extremely dangerous: ‘Herbal medicines can have a very significant effect on the body. 'In certain circumstances, such as when aconite is taken orally, they can be extremely dangerous. 'Natural does not mean safe. To help you choose a herbal medicine that is suitable for you, look for a product that has a Traditional Herbal Registration or product license number on the packaging. These products have met the acceptable quality and safety standards. 'And if you think you have suffered a side effect to an herbal medicine, please tell us about it through our Yellow Card Scheme.' Websites selling Zheng Tian Wan advertise it as a ‘formula with a thousand year history that stops headache and migraine’. Experts are urging those who have taken the medicine to visit their doctor . However, MHRA guidelines dictate that aconite should not be used in unlicensed products for oral use and herbal practitioners in the UK are only allowed use aconite externally on unbroken skin. Products intended for oral use containing aconite are not permitted in the UK without authorisation, while only qualified doctors can prescribe aconite's use in oral medicines, under the prescription-only medicine scheme. An MHRA spokesman said: 'It's difficult to say how much is out there, because it's a traditional Chinese medicine, so it's not something we regulate. ‘It is also difficult to tell what the levels are in a product without testing it but the fact is, aconite is a particularly toxic product so regardless of the levels we would advice people not to take it. ‘If it was sold online we could have it taken down to have it removed from sale but we do not know where every traditional Chinese practitioner is working.’ They urge anyone who has taken Zheng Tian Wan, which is made by the Shenzhen 999 Chinese Medicine Investment Development Co, or any other aconite-containing product, to speak to their GP or healthcare professionals as soon as possible.","Zheng Tian Wan is unregulated but available in the UK .

"BBC Radio 3 has been accused of dumbing down as it suffered its lowest ratings during a Proms season for 15 years. The classical music channel normally benefits from a ratings boost during its summer concert season but saw its weekly listening figures slump by almost six per cent in a year. This year’s proms featured a performance by the Pet Shop Boys and soul singer Laura Mvula alongside its more traditional fare of Brahms and Beethoven. Singer Laura Mvula performed at this year's proms at the Royal Albert Hall - but failed to boost Radio 3's ratings . But the populist programme failed to boost the station’s ratings. In the three months to the end of September it attracted a weekly audience of 1.9million, down from 2million in the third quarter of last year. Although the figure was a slight rise on the number who watched in the second quarter of this year, the total number of listening hours, 11.2million, was the smallest for a Proms season. Radio 3’s former controller, Roger Wright, stepped down from his post in March. He was hit by repeated accusations that the channel had been dumbed down to compete with commercial rivals by scheduling a lighter repertoire including more soundtracks. Classic FM also saw its listening figures drop in the last quarter, to 5.2million, down from 5.3million at the same time last year. BBC insiders insisted the main reason for the reduced listening figures was that it had encouraged more listeners to tune in online via its mobile apps and iPlayer service, which are not included in the quarterly listening figures. But spokesman for lobby group Friends of Radio 3: ‘Radio 3’s current editorial strategy didn’t stand much chance of retaining the station’s audience, still less building it up.’ Radio 3’s former controller, Roger Wright, stepped down from his post in March. He was hit by repeated accusations that the channel had been dumbed down to compete with commercial rivals . Earlier this month, culture minister Ed Vaizey revealed at the Radio Festival that he never listens to Radio 3. Asked why not, he said: ‘Because I love Classic FM, it’s an absolutely brilliant station I love it, it plays lovely music and is run by an amazing person. ‘What’s wrong with Radio 3? That’s a real half empty question. The question is what’s right with Classic FM? It plays music I love in an accessible and informal fashion.’ The incoming Radio 3 controller Alan Davey insisted he would not be ‘dumbing down’ the station and could dontinue to offer highbrow programmes to his listeners. He said: ‘It’s one quarter’s listening figures we are talking about. We don’t yet have a trend. I will be addressing it by doing what Radio 3 does best – offering complex culture, arts and ideas within the reach of lots of people.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘The station has never chased ratings and its audience has fluctuated around 2 million since records began. Recent listening figures are consistent with this trend and we have also seen on-demand listening and audience appreciation at record levels.’","Radio station has had its lowest ratings during a Proms season for 15 years .

"Four Greenpeace activists were hurt, one of them badly, when the Spanish navy rammed their dinghy during a protest, the environmental group said. One 23-year-old woman had to be airlifted to hospital after her leg was broken, and another activist had to be treated for cuts and bruises following the dawn clash off the Canary Islands. Video footage of the confrontation taken by Greenpeace shows Spanish navy high-speed boats ramming the activists' dinghies as they approach an oil drilling ship. Scroll down for video . Confrontation: A Greenpeace activist is rescued from the sea after she is thrown overboard during a clash between environmental campaigners and the Spanish navy in the waters off the Canary Islands . 'It's another reminder of the lengths governments will go to protect the oil industry from peaceful protesters,' Greenpeace said in a statement. The navy disputed the environmentalists' account, saying had it dispatched two boats to prevent Greenpeace from boarding the large oil drilling ship. The activist was seriously injured when she fell out of her dinghy and was hit by its propellers, the navy said. Speaking to The Associated Press by radio-telephone from Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, Captain Joel Stewart identified the badly hurt woman as a 23-year-old Italian activist. The other three other injuries were minor, he said. The navy told the AP it rushed the badly hurt activist to a Spanish hospital in a helicopter. Greenpeace's statement said: 'The 23 year old Italian who was knocked overboard and had her leg broken, has been taken to a hospital on shore by a navy helicopter, and is in good condition. Another activist was treated on board the Arctic Sunrise for minor cuts. 'We're thankful that no one else was seriously injured, and outraged at the unjustified use of force.' Forceful: A boat carrying Spanish marines careers into the side of the Greenpeace activists' dinghy . Quick action: Military boats hemmed the activists in on both sides before they could carry out their protest . In Madrid, lawmaker Diego Lopez Garrido of Spain's main opposition Socialist party, said he would call defence minister Pedro Morenes to parliament to explain the navy's actions. Last month, at the Spanish government's request, the Constitutional Court blocked a proposal by the Canary Islands regional government to hold a referendum on oil exploration in waters. Some residents of the sun-kissed archipelago off north-west Africa fear oil spills could damage their islands, which are one of Europe's tourism magnets and home to an important fishing industry. The World Wildlife Fund also recently launched a campaign against drilling off the Canaries, which are home to nearly a third of the world's whale and dolphin species. WWF Spain’s secretary general, Juan Carlos del Olmo, told The Olive Press: 'We’re talking about an area that’s Europe’s richest when it comes to whales and one of the top in the world.' Oil spills, contamination and loud noises could all threaten their fragile ecosystem, he warned. The government licensed the Spanish energy company Repsol YPF SA to begin oil exploration there, and it is doing that now from a large oil drilling ship with a platform. The navy also dispatched a frigate to the area where the Repsol facility is due to operate. Greenpeace geologist Julio Barea said today that he believes its oil exploration could cause ""grave"" environmental damage around the islands.","Italian activist, 23, airlifted to hospital after falling overboard during protest .

"Obamacare is more unpopular than ever, a new poll finds, just as the state and federal health exchanges central to the health care reform law reopen for business. Americans looking to purchase health insurance for the upcoming year through the health care marketplace could do so beginning on Saturday. A Gallup poll released this morning shows that many are none too happy about, however, with just 37 percent of survey-takers saying they approved of the law requiring them to purchase health insurance or be fined by the government if they are not already insured by their employer. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Open enrollment into the federal health exchanges began on Saturday - just as a poll came out showing that most Americans disapprove of the health care reform law . The percentage of Americans who support the law has not topped the percentage who don't for the last two years. But Gallup's latest poll shows perceptions of Obamacare steadily turning negative since this summer after briefly ticking upward earlier this year, and disapproval of the president's signature law now stands at a peak 56 percent. The negative survey follows reports from independent analysts that many of the 7 million Americans who participated in the health exchanges last year and plan to re-enroll this year will have to change plans if they don't want to see their premiums increase. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers's Health Research Institute, premiums will rise on average 3.5 percent in 2015, though enrollees in some states could significantly lower premiums than before while others see wildly higher costs. Republicans in Congress have pointed to the increased costs as a key reason  to gut the health care reform law, passed in 2010 when Democrats ruled the roost, and start from scratch. The Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable, they have said, and Americans would be better off without it. Many Republicans who won midterm elections made Obamacare repeal a central theme of their campaigns, and the GOP has said one of their first acts in the new legislative session will be to call a vote on the issue. As of January, the Republican Party will control both the House and the Senate and will therefore be able to bring legislation undoing the law to the floor. Republicans will hold a maximum of 54 seats in the Senate if they win a runoff election in Louisiana next month, however, putting them far short of the 67 votes they would need to overcome President Barack Obama's inevitable veto of the repeal legislation. Recognizing that repeal is politically impractical, they have vowed to chip away at the law wherever possible until they receive the power to strip it entirely. Obamacare approval hit a new low today, according to Gallup's latest survey . Meanwhile, a news report released this morning that coincides with the start of the second round of Obamacare enrollments claims that many of the positive comments posted throughout the last two years on a pro-Obamacare Facebook page operated by the president's allies were created by the same core group of users trying to tip the scales of the debate toward their side of the issue. According to the Washington Times, 60 percent of the 226,838 comments posted on Organizing for Action's Obamacare Facebook page between September 2012 and October 2014 were created by fewer than 100 unique Facebook users - some of whom used multiple aliases to spread their message. One California woman who supports the law, Cindi Huynh, used four different Facebook accounts to post an average of 59 flatting comments about the law a day over a 60-day period, making her the top commenter for those two months. Huynh told the Times she was not paid to post on the site, but its analysis of her posts shows that she only posted on the site during traditional work hours and never on weekends. That was also the case for the other top 25 posters to the page, the Times found. Another woman named Wanda Milner who lives in Canada wrote 4,695 adulatory posts throughout the two-year period the Times' analysts reviewed, though Milner told the news publication that posts from other accounts in her name were not written by her and were instead meant to mock her zealous advocacy of the law. Despite living outside the country, Milner says she too was not paid for her posts. Rather she said is just strongly supportive of health care overhaul in the U.S. The managers of the page declined to return the Washington Times' request for confirmation that the Obamacare advocates were not being paid to promote the law. At least one of the prolific posters, a retired veteran named Paul J. Nunley who lives in New Mexico, was protesting the law on the page, the Times also found. Nunley wrote 2,316 anti-Obamacare posts in 60 days and was the second highest commenter during that period, just behind Huynh. He told the Washington Times he's made it his full-time job to post on the page and 'rid it of misinformation.'","Health care exchanges reopened for enrollment on Saturday .

"Jailed: Jack Cottle (pictured today), 22, gatecrashed the  race at the famous track in Kent with his girlfriend and a friend on board as passengers . A joyrider who drove his girlfriend's Volkswagen Polo on to the Brands Hatch circuit during a race was today jailed for eight months. Jack Cottle, 22, of Durgates, East Sussex, gatecrashed the Fun Cup endurance race at the famous track near Swanley in Kent with his girlfriend and a friend on board as passengers. The labourer put the lives of racers at danger after being ‘egged on’ to drive a full circuit after accessing the track via a pit lane on June 14, Maidstone Crown Court heard. YouTube footage which has been viewed more than two million times shows Cottle ignoring his hysterical girlfriend as she implores him repeatedly to ‘stop it’. She then tells him that he is ‘going the wrong way’ before screaming ‘Jack, oh my God!’ as she realises he is taking the car on to the track to laughter from his backseat passenger. She could be heard pleading with Cottle to get off the track, as specially-adapted racing Beetle cars taking part in a four-hour endurance race sped past them at speeds of up to 100mph. Last month Cottle pleaded guilty to ‘causing a nuisance to the public by driving on to the race track at Brands Hatch whilst an endurance race was in progress’. At the previous hearing, he said it had been ‘a foolish and immature prank’ and he ‘should not have let it go that far’. Cottle claimed he had been ‘dared to do it’ but he was ‘sorry’. He used a Polo 1.2 litre car which belonged to an 18-year-old schoolgirl who knew the pair, but did not realise Cottle would drive it onto the track. Despite the stunt being slammed as ‘reckless and stupid’ by many viewers of the video, Cottle initially defended his actions on his Facebook page, insisting he was ‘proud to be different’. On another Facebook page called ‘Full Throttle Cottle’ he boasted it was ‘quite funny’, and he also uploaded videos on his own Facebook page of him driving a BMW and skidding it to leave burning tyre marks on the road. Scroll down for video . Brands Hatch: At a previous hearing, Cottle (in the Polo, left) said it had been ‘a foolish and immature prank’ Two million YouTube views: Cottle (left) with Zac Copson (right), who was the cameraman in the back of car . Today at his sentencing hearing, Judge Martin Joy said Cottle, had ‘endangered many lives’ as he branded his actions ‘premeditated’ and ‘inexcusable’. The court heard that Cottle, his girlfriend and his friend paid £14 per head to watch the four-hour race as spectators. The event involved 26 cars and nearly 80 participants competing in teams, with nearly £250,000 paid to the race organisers in competition fees. But Judge Joy said that around three and a half hours into the race, Cottle ‘saw an opportunity’ to get on to the race track. ‘With your girlfriend in the front passenger seat and your other friend in the back filming, you drove your girlfriend's car on to the track,’ the judge said. ‘You drove a full circuit and I have seen the films with sound commentary showing your girlfriend was hysterical and screaming and begging you to stop, and also protesting it was her car.’ His girlfriend had to be taken to the on-site medical centre after having a panic attack, while Cottle came off the track laughing, the judge said. 'Oh my God!' YouTube footage shows Cottle ignoring his hysterical girlfriend as she implores him to 'stop it' 'Inexcusable': More than three hours into the race, Cottle 'saw an opportunity' to get on to the race track . One driver thought the VW Polo was a doctor's vehicle or a safety car but when it emerged it was a prank, other racers who had paid to compete became upset at their day being ruined. In footage shown in court, one driver had to have his release from the pit lane delayed as Cottle drove the white VW Polo on to the track. Prosecutor Iestyn Morgan said racers were travelling at speeds of 100mph, while Cottle was behind the wheel of an ordinary road car with no roll cage or fire extinguisher. He said: ‘It was quite clear that (Cottle) put himself and his passengers in danger, and those of drivers on the track who would not have expected a car going considerably slower.’ Mr Morgan added: ‘While racing was resumed after it had been red-flagged, the race was cut short. There was evidence that a number of competitors were upset about what happened. ‘As far as the impact to Fun Cup UK, which organised the race, they lost about 30 minutes, at a cost of around £4,200 to them. ‘Brands Hatch are particularly concerned about this being copied, in particular because videos were posted on YouTube. ‘As of July last year, when the statements were given, that video had more than 2,300,000 views.’ In police interview, Cottle admitted he had not driven on to the track by accident. Mr Morgan said: ‘He knew he was going down a pit lane and said, in effect, that he was being egged on.’ He also told police: ‘When do you think you get that opportunity?’ Filmed inside: The judge said Cottle had 'endangered many lives' as he branded his actions 'premeditated' Four-hour race: The event at Brands Hatch involved 26 cars and nearly 80 participants competing in teams . Defence counsel Ailsa Williamson said Cottle - dressed in a navy suit and patterned tie - ‘lacks maturity and is easily led’. She said: ‘The best mitigation is Mr Cottle's very early guilty plea at the preliminary hearing and I would ask Your Honour to give Mr Cottle full credit for that plea. 'It also follows full admission to the police. It was very fortunate that there were no injuries to the competitors in the race. ‘This is not a case of Mr Cottle ignoring requests from marshals to turn around or going through barriers. His recklessness was not stopping before he went on to the track.’ As he was led away to the cells, Cottle blew kisses to family and friends in the public gallery. Jonathan Palmer, chief executive of MSV, the owners of Brands Hatch, said following the sentencing: ‘I am really pleased that Kent Police and the court have quite rightly taken such a tough stance on this deliberately reckless act, which endangered the lives of the drivers racing on circuit and the volunteer track marshals, not to mention Jack Cottle and his passengers. ‘His idiotic and selfish behaviour - aggravated by his unrepentant attitude in subsequent media coverage - received much immediate condemnation. 'His conviction and prison sentence will serve to reinforce the message that this kind of anti-social behaviour is not only stupid, but will lead to prosecution.’","Jack Cottle, 22, gatecrashed Fun Cup endurance race at famous track .

"Myth? Contemporary biographers have turned Lewis Carroll (pictured in later life) into a social misfit with an unhealthy interest in little girls . Lewis Carroll has been cast by many modern biographers as a social misfit with an unhealthy interest in little girls that led him to take hundreds of nude photographs of them. But a leading authority on the author has now claimed this is a ‘myth’ created by spurious and sloppy research. Edward Wakeling has criticised biographers who have given the author of two of literature’s greatest children’s classics - Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass - a disturbing modern reputation. Previously-unpublished letters and reminiscences of those who knew him are among thousands of documents which Mr Wakeling has collected over four decades. They offer evidence that Carroll was in fact a sociable man who enjoyed adult company as much as children’s, he said, adding: ‘It’s both. You can’t just say it’s one and not the other.’ From an opus of some 3,000 photographs, Mr Wakeling has calculated that nude photographs of children represent ‘no more than 1 per cent of Carroll’s output’. While Katie Roiphe wrote a novel portraying Carroll as holding sexual feelings towards his muse, biographer Morton N Cohen observed that it would be ‘naïve’ to suggest that Carroll’s interest in children was ‘strictly artistic’. But Mr Wakeling points to unpublished material, including reminiscences of Mabel Amy Burton, who was eight when she met Carroll in 1877. She recalled: ‘As a small child I much disliked strangers, but the personality of this gentleman attracted me and I chatted away with him quite freely.’ Young girl: Alice Liddell (pictured) was photographed many times by Carroll. Pictured above in 1858, she was the daughter of family friend Henry George Liddell and the inspiration for Alice in Wonderland . On news of his death, she wrote of the ‘irreparable loss in the hearts of many who had been his child-friends’. Mr Wakeling says: ‘It is about time we cleared up, once and for all, the pervading false myth about [Carroll’s] unhealthy relationship with children. He was a lover of children but he was not an abuser of children.’ He added: ‘There must be 30 or 40 biographies since his nephew wrote the first one in 1898. ‘People who decide to write about Carroll realise that they’re not going to get their book published unless they can find a new angle. ‘Quite a few of them have scratched their head and come up with something outrageous and controversial like Lewis Carroll was Jack the Ripper, that he didn’t write Alice - Queen Victoria did - that he was having a sexual affair with Alice’s mother, and a lot more nonsense… . ‘Then there are biographers who really don’t do their homework. They read a few other biographies, regurgitate them, add a few bits of speculation - and that’s it.’ Also pictured by Carroll: Gertrude Chataway, photographed (above) in 1876, was one of the author's closest friends. The girl inspired his nonsense poem The Hunting of the Snark . Then, he suggests, like Chinese whispers, untrue facts get shared and embellished. He argues that, if biographers went back to the primary sources, they would discover a very different picture of Lewis Carroll, the pseudonym of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. As a writer of children’s books, Carroll (above) needed to explore children, a leading authority says . Mr Wakeling is a former chairman of the Lewis Carroll Society, who regularly advises auctioneers and exhibitions worldwide. His books include Carroll’s ten-volume Diaries, which he edited in 2007 following their release by the family. He also owns one of the finest Carrollian collections, including a database of 6,000 letters, of which some 4,000 are unpublished: ‘So there’s a great wealth of material I can draw on.’ He publishes his research later this month in a new book titled Lewis Carroll: The Man and His Circle. Numerous ‘myths’ that he challenges include those relating to Carroll’s photography, of which perhaps the most prevalent – ‘frequently used by writers, biographers and journalists’ – is the supposed large body of studies of nude children: ‘This is not borne out by the facts.’ He argues that picturing nude children and focussing his camera on girls was common practice among Victorian photographers and that, when Carroll visited family friends, boys were more likely to be away at school. Vilifying a man who believed in girls’ education is therefore unjustified. Anyway, there are as well many photographs of boys and adults. As a writer of children’s books, Carroll needed to explore children, Mr Wakeling pointed out: ‘His relationship with children is not an all-encompassing part of his life, which many of the biographers tried to suggest. ‘He was a teacher. He actually enjoyed the intellectual banter that he could have with children. Children in Victorian times found that very refreshing because it was very uncommon for someone to treat them as equals. Children were seen and not heard.’ Photographed: Carroll also took portraits of poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson in 1857 (left) and Prince Leopold, the eighth child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1875 (right) For Carroll, Mr Wakeling added, ‘they were seen and heard’. Reviewing reminiscences by Carroll’s child-friends, Mr Wakeling could not find ‘a bad word spoken against him’. Those friends included Edith Litton, who described Carroll as ‘one of my most delightful friends’ with a ‘sweet smile’. She was seven when he read her the story of Hans Andersen’s Ugly Duckling: ‘Being very sensitive about my ugly little self, it greatly interested me.’ He told her that ‘it was better to be good, truthful’. Mr Wakeling ridicules Carroll’s portrayal as an eccentric misfit: ‘The vast majority of the biographers say he was a shy, reclusive man. Nonsense. He was a socialite. ‘He mixed with the great and the good of Victorian society - all the Pre-Raphaelites, Arthur Sullivan [the composer], famous politicians. ‘He was a friend of the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, whose parties he was often invited to. This man is not a recluse and he isn’t shy.’ His evidence includes an unpublished letter from Lady Georgina Salisbury, telling Carroll: ‘The children are very anxious you should come to their party… and, if you could come on the 31st and stay over the 3rd January, we should be delighted to see you.’ His circle of friends included Sir James Paget, surgeon to Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales. In response to Carroll’s concern for a friend who was dying from cancer, Paget wrote: ‘I will gladly see the poor lady.’ ‘Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it,’ thought Carroll, and in Mr Wakeling’s book it is clear: to defend him from his modern character assassins. The book is published ahead of next year’s celebrations marking the 150th anniversary of the publication of Alice, and include a major BBC documentary, books and exhibitions worldwide. But no doubt those with suspicious minds will be back.","Edward Wakeling has collected reminiscences of those who knew Carroll .

"Pregnancy eating: A bad diet could leave women stuck with extra weight for life . Young mothers are often thought to be at an advantage when it comes to getting back in shape after pregnancy. But in fact women who have babies in their teens are significantly more likely than older mothers to become obese later in life, research shows. Those who had their first child aged 19 or younger were a third more likely to be very overweight, it found. Significantly fewer women who gave birth in their teens were of normal weight than those who had babies later. Lead . author Dr Tammy Chang said: ‘For the first time, we’ve identified our . youngest mums as a high risk group for obesity, one of the most . debilitating long-term health issues we face. ‘When . taking care of teen mums, we often have so many immediate concerns – . childcare, housing, school, social and financial support – that we don’t . often think of long-term health effects.’ After controlling for factors such as . race, education and background, the scientists found women who gave . birth before 19 had a 32 per cent higher risk of obesity than women who . had given birth at age 20 or later. The survey by the University of Michigan of US women aged between 20 and 59 is believed to be the first to identify teen pregnancy as a predictor of obesity. Around 15 per cent of British women are now obese when expecting a child – up from 7 per cent 20 years ago. Last year, researchers from Queen Mary, University of London found mothers with a calorie-controlled diet were less likely to suffer life-threatening pre-eclampsia and other complications such as diabetes, high blood pressure or premature birth. Post pregnancy weight: Mothers who had their first child as a teenager were a third more likely to be very overweight . Following a healthy diet reduced weight gain during pregnancy by nearly half a stone on average.The study, published on bmj.com, also said bad diet in pregnancy could leave women stuck with extra pounds for life. Dr Chang said of her research, published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology: ‘We need further studies to better understand the link between teen birth and obesity, so physicians and  policy-makers can provide the best care to teen mothers. ‘Obesity is a prevalent, expensive health problem and it’s difficult to reverse, which is why it’s incredibly important to identify at-risk groups early so that we can intervene.’","Around 15 per cent of British women are now obese when expecting a baby .

"A card arrives at my villa at Landaa Giraavaru, Maldives. 'Dear Sue, we will be waiting for you at 7pm at the main jetty.' With the note is a parcel containing a sarong. 'Please wear this for our special evening.' A life on an ocean wave: The Four Seasons resort in the Maldives has its own luxury boat, Explorer . We meet on the jetty in our sarongs and are guided to a super-smart double-decker motor launch. There is champagne, canapes and the perfect sunset. All fabulous, but in this neck of the luxury woods - where dining is not just about the food, it is about ingenuity - not unique. Then as dusk falls the secret of the evening is revealed. We are dropped off on a sandbank 150ft long, 50ft wide and about two inches above the sea. A bar has been dug out of the sand with oval seating and we are served rum cocktails in coconuts by candlelight. The entertainment is crab-racing - I select number 27, my birthday - and it wins. Dinner is called and we walk along a lantern-lit path until we reach the table, again dug into the sand with seating either side. It is laid up formally, with white linen, silver cutlery, too many wine glasses to count, flowers and a menu card. Each course has a title. Following the amuse bouche is After The Sunset, then Setting The Mood, The Moon Has Come Out, Shooting Stars and The Sound Of The Waves, and each course is served with its own wine chosen by the Fours Seasons' sommelier and, I have to admit it, I am blown away. 'Can you believe we are sitting in the middle of the Indian Ocean under a full moon, eating brulee out of a pineapple on a sand table?' said my friend, Kate. Actually no. It was pinch-yourself time. Not a bad location to enjoy the sunset: The resort has suites which rank as the size of most houses . The trouble with paradise, say some, is that there is nothing to do. But they miss the point. The Maldives is a Disneyland for adults. Palm trees and pale powder beaches, a translucent, turquoise sea full of fish with names like parrot, surgeon and emperor angel, and the scent of bougainvillea, hibiscus and frangipani everywhere. It's pure Castaway, only with air-con, wi-fi and your very own Man Friday. There are around a hundred resorts, each on its own island, and what sets each apart is not geography but style and service. Four Seasons has the answer for anyone who fears that they will get bored staying on one small island - a few nights each at Kuda Huraa and Landaa Giraavaru, punctuated by a stay on Explorer, a luxury three-deck cruiser. The sandbank dinner is part of the itinerary for the boat stay, although it won't appear in the brochure. The secret is part of the surprise. We spent one night on the boat travelling between resorts. I rose at 6am from my queen-sized bed in the cream-carpeted cabin for a sunrise snorkel with the resident marine biologist. Soon we were swimming among hundreds of yellow and blue striped sweetlip and an army of fusiliers. The biologist pointed to the cornets, easy to spot with their long and skinny bodies, and the butterflies, brown and white with a long nose, and she enlightened me on the difference between an emperor angel fish, left, and damsel angel. We also ticked off masked bannerfish, a dog tooth tuna, a giant moray (eel) and porcupine fish. It is difficult to decide which resort I liked best. Kuda Huraa, just 25 minutes by boat from the airport, scores on convenience, and the spa on its own little island is gorgeous. A swirl of colours and shapes: The waters of the Maldives teem with fabulous fish and bright wildlife . But several things at the larger Landaa Giraavaru won it over for me. The first was being given a Manta On Call service, which would alert me if the manta rays, which measure about 5ft and for which the region is famed, were sighted (sadly, they weren't). Second was the beach - a headway separates two parts of the lagoon and the view is out of this world. Third was the service (chocolate popsicles handed out by the pool, a sunglasses butler and a chief engineer who repaired my glasses after I stepped on them) and fourth was, of course, the sandbank dinner. Luxury Holidays Direct (www.luxuryholidaysdirect.com, 020 8774 7299) offers 11 nights with Four Seasons in the Maldives from £5,985 per person. This includes return flights from Gatwick, transfers, four nights' half-board at Four Seasons Kuda Huraa, a three-night full-board cruise on the Four Seasons Explorer and four nights' half-board at Four Seasons Landaa Giraavaru Resort.","Guests at the Four Seasons in the Maldives can try drinks with a difference .

"Halliburton is buying rival oilfield services company Baker Hughes in a cash-and-stock deal worth $34.6 billion. The deal comes just days after talks between the two had stalled and Halliburton prepared to go hostile with its takeover bid. By the end, though, it appeared that relations between the companies thawed and that Halliburton's acquisition of Baker Hughes was not hostile. 'We envision a combined company capable of achieving opportunities that neither company would have realized as well - or as quickly- on its own,' Baker Hughes Chairman and CEO Martin Craighead said after the deal was announced. Shares of both Halliburton and Baker Hughes stocks surged after the takeover was announced on Sunday. Halliburton will become the biggest oil services company in the world . The combined energy company would generate slightly larger revenue than Schlumberger Ltd., currently the world's biggest oil services company. Halliburton,  which was once led by former Vice President Dick Cheney, operates oil services contracts around the world. However, it may be best known by the public for its role in the Iraq War and its involvement with the Deep Water Horizon oil rig disaster, which spilled 210million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Companies like Halliburton and Baker Hughes can be the first in the energy sector to the feel pressure from plunging prices, and both have seen their stock fall in recent months. Global oil prices have tumbled 31 percent over the past 5 months to levels not seen in four years. The transaction is valued at $78.62 per Baker Hughes Inc. share, a 31 percent premium to its Friday closing price of $59.89. Baker Hughes shareholders will receive 1.12 Halliburton shares plus $19.00 in cash for each share they own. Halliburton will pay $78.62 a share for Baker Hughes - a 31percent premium . The companies put the deal's enterprise value at about $38 billion. When the transaction is complete, Baker Hughes stockholders will own approximately 36 percent of the combined company. On Friday it appeared that talks were falling apart, with Baker Hughes saying that Halliburton had refused to raise its first and only offer. The company did not say what that offer was. Halliburton Chairman and CEO Dave Lesar said Monday that the combined company will realize annual cost savings of nearly $2 billion. Halliburton plans to finance the cash portion of the acquisition through a combination of available cash and fully committed debt financing. The boards of both Houston companies approved the deal unanimously and it's targeted to close in the second half of 2015. Shareholders and regulators must still sign off on the tie-up. Halliburton said that it is willing to divest businesses that generate up to $7.5 billion in revenues, if required by regulators, but the company though believes that the divestitures required will be significantly less. Halliburton has also agreed to pay a termination fee of $3.5 billion if the transaction ends due to a failure to obtain the necessary antitrust approvals. Baker Hughes's stock rose more than 15 percent in Monday premarket trading, while shares of Halliburton fell more than 3 percent.","The corporate acquisition will make Halliburton the biggest oil services company in the world .

"We’re still months away from being able to readily buy the Oculus Rift headset, but the latest prototype suggests the final version will be worth the wait. The Facebook-owned firm has unveiled its Crescent Bay model of the virtual reality technology that is lighter than its predecessor, and now features 360-degree tracking. Earlier this month, reports claimed the consumer version of the device will launch in 2015 and could cost as little as $200 (£122). Scroll down for video . The Crescent Bay virtual reality headset (pictured) was unveiled at the Oculus Connect conference in Hollywood at the weekend. It is lighter than its predecessor and features 360-degree tracking, but Oculus VR is yet to release the full list of specifications for the device . The Crescent Bay model was unveiled by Oculus chief executive Brendan Iribe at the company’s Connect conference last weekend. The 360-degree tracking means the headset will be able to more accurately monitor a wearer's head movements, which in turn will make games more immersive and true-to-life. MailOnline has been using the latest version of the headset, the $350 (£215) DK2 version aimed at developers wanting to write VR apps. At first we were skeptical - the headset looks bulky, although it is surprisingly light when attached via straps. However, once you are immersed in a virtual world, doubts were quickly forgotten. The technology, still just a developer's version, is breathtakingly good. While the resolution still doesn't give the feeling of quite being in the real world, it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world. The number of demos and games is already growing by the day, and feature everything from virtual rollercoaster rides to being lost in space, all made more immersive with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as your head moves. It's not quite ready for primetime yet, but is almost there - and the Oculus Rift headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality. Elsewhere, the headset has a higher resolution, per eye, than the current second-generation development kit – DK2 - and these displays are powered by Samsung devices. A teardown of the DK2 revealed that the headset uses Samsung Galaxy Note 3 displays, and experts claim the latest generation device will feature screens from the flagship Note 4. By comparison, the DK2 has a resolution of 960 x 1080 per eye, and the Note 4 screens would give the latest model 1280 x 1440 resolution. Aside from these specifications, Oculus VR is yet to release the rest of Crescent Bay’s features. ‘There are plenty of technical challenges left to solve for the consumer Rift, but Crescent Bay is truly the best virtual reality headset we've ever built,’ said Mr Iribe. The price of the Oculus Rift consumer model, which does not have a release date yet, was revealed by Oculus VR co-founder Nate Mitchell. Speaking with Eurogamer, Mr Mitchell said the price could go up to $400 (£240), but that the price range was an estimate. He also cautioned that nothing is set in stone. 'That could slide in either direction depending on scale, pre-orders, the components we end up using, [or] business negotiations,' he said. Previously, Oculus VR said it was aiming to launch the consumer model for around $300 (£185). Developers can currently buy protoype versions of the headset for $350 (£215). Crescent Bay (pictured) has a higher resolution, per eye, than the current second-generation development kit – DK2 - and these displays are powered by the Samsung devices. A consumer model of the headset is expected to launch next year with price estimates ranging from $200 (£122) up to $400 (£240) The firm also revealed earlier this month it has been working with Samsung on a mobile version of the headset, which will go on sale this year, but will not feature the advanced head tracking or high resolution display the Oculus version is expected to have. Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when its $2bn (£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved. It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg. A commercial version is rumoured to launch in 2015. The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, which has already unveiled its own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year.

"Scammers have allegedly hired IT experts to successfully win around 100 tickets to dine at chef Heston Blumenthal's pop-up restaurant in Melbourne. Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal's England-based restaurant The Fat Duck will temporarily be relocated to Melbourne for six months in 2015. 14,000 people will be able to enjoy the incredible culinary experience before the  restaurant at Crown Melbourne closes doors close forever. Last month, Australians had the chance to put their name in an online ballot to win a table at his temporary Fat Duck restaurant and it appeared that a total of 89,179 people entered the ballot from all over the world. However, at least 100 tickets were secured by  scalpers who entered hundreds of time using false names and their correct email address and phone numbers, according toFairfax Media. Scroll down for video . Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal is closing his England restaurant temporarily and will instead open a temporary restaurant in Melbourne for six months from September 2015 . Heston Blumenthal's unique sensory dishes have made his one of the world's most notorious chefs . The restaurant, The Fat Duck, will be opened at The Crown in Melbourne in Feburary 2015 for six months . It's reported that several financial professionals went to great lengths to scam the ballot system, each successfully winning around 40 of the incredibly rare restaurant reservations. Although Crown is currently looking into their legal options, it’s claimed the applicants have not broken any law so could potentially be allowed to keep their tickets. The 'tickets' are a hot item, with many of the people who left out desperate to experience Blumenthal's culinary mastery. The British chef's signature dishes infuse science with food and he is known for his kooky creations, including lickable wallpaper a la Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and bacon and egg ice cream. Already ads are appearing on online websites such as Gumtree from desperate foodies, offering up to $1000 to buy a ticket to dine at the restaurant – in addition the restaurant’s price of $525-a-head. The 'tickets' are a hot item, with many of the people who left out desperate to experience Blumenthal's culinary mastery . It’s believed the scam, which involved reserving seats with a pseudonym but correct contact details, was conducted by scalpers, hoping to increase their chances of winning the tickets and to then sell them at an extortionate price. Other wealthy professionals allegedly employed the same method simply to ‘guarantee’ they would win reservations. Fairfax media allege they are now gifting extra reservations to loved ones and wealthy clients, as well as selling them to colleagues. More than 250,000 applicants were unsuccessful in their attempt to reserve a table at the ‘pop-up’ restaurant which will run from The Crown in Melbourne for six months from February. More than 250,000 applicants were unsuccessful in their attempt to reserve a table at the ‘pop-up’ restaurant . An IT expert in China was hired to work out a way to allow the user to enter the ballot multiple times, according to reports. It’s alleged the loophole was found because the website did not record the applicants’ IP address. The revelation comes after a hilarious fiasco when the celebrity chef tried to call the last 13 people to secure reservations to tell them about their success. He had very little success and he and the people around him have been filmed in hysterics as the well-intentioned phone calls went from bad to worse. The tenth person Mr Blumenthal called was the first to finally show a positive reaction. The first nine callers either hung up, did not answer, did not believe him or were just unimpressed with the offer. The first man the chef rang sounded entirely apathetic about the whole experience, explaining that he was not fussed and that his girlfriend has 'already won tickets anyway'. One man was dubious and had a colourful response to the phone call. ‘You’re sh***ing me, aren’t you?’ he exclaims. 'I'm not sh***ing you at all, it's me, really,' a bemused Mr Blumenthal responds.

"You wait years for a new console to turn up, and then two arrive at once. Following Microsoft’s Xbox One launch last week, Sony have finally launched their PlayStation 4 – and the good news is, there’s plenty of quality launch games. Here, MailOnline runs the rule over the biggest ones. Killzone: Shadow Fall 5/5 . Simply the best: At the risk of annoying Xbox One fans, Killzone: Shadow Fall is hands-down the best-looking launch title on either console . Quite simply, breath-taking. Boasting visuals on par with some of the best-looking PC games around, Shadow Fall is the definitive launch title to show the PS4’s impressive power. But it’s not all style over substance. Following the painfully average Killzone 3 on last-gen, Shadow Fall is a real step forward in the series in terms of level design and gameplay. Clearly influenced by Halo and Crysis, there’s less emphasis on shooting from behind cover and firefights encourage you to use the multi-tiered levels to your advantage. Coupled with the new OWL – a handy flying drone that lets you shoot ziplines, hack terminals and attack baddies - and there's plenty of freedom to approach levels how you want. AI is strong, too. Enemies will flank and throw grenades if you’re too ‘cover happy’. But the star of the show are the environments. Gone are the grey, mono-tone city-scapes that plagued the last games. Here, you’ll be dodging trains in the sun-kissed city of Vetka, skydive from orbit and glide between crumbling buildings, and traverse ruined worlds where the ground falls apart beneath your feet. Shadow Fall isn’t just a launch game. It’s THE launch game, and essential for any PS4 owner. Call of Duty: Ghosts 3/5 . That a boy: Riley is one of many new characters in Ghosts and takes centre stage during stealth missions . It may not do anything to evolve the series (in fact, some may argue it’s a step back), but there’s still fun to be had here. After the brilliant opening level - which somehow manages to mix a walk in the woods with a mission to space - it's very much business as usual. New mechanics including the use of a 'remote controlled' dog, Riley, are fun but ultimately underdeveloped, while the set-pieces aren't quite as epic as you'd expect. You do, however, get to see a German Shepherd take down a helicopter... Unlike the Xbox One, Ghosts runs in 1080p (full high definition) on PS4, so expect it to be on par with PC versions of the game. Compared to current-gen, framerate runs at 60FPS consistently, so everything feels more fluid, too. Far from an essential purchase, and not quite a 'next-gen' COD, but still worth a look if you haven’t bought it already. Putty Squad – 4/5 . Blast from the past: Putty Squad does nothing to show off the power of the hardware, but oozes charm and an addictive pick-up-and-play structure . Some may find it strange seeing this game among the heavy-hitters at launch, but don’t write this quirky offering off too quickly. Harking back to the golden age of gaming, this deliciously simple platformer offers something completely different to the other titles. You play Putty, who’s on a mission to save his friends. Cue loads of levels, incredibly cute enemies and a solid retro soundtrack. It won’t show off the PS4’s power by any means, but as a cut-price title it’s fantastic value for money and worryingly addictive, too. Plus, it's sure to appeal to fans of 'indie-style' games. Injustice: Gods Among Us 4/5 . Dark Knight rises (again): This may be one of the 'older' games available at launch, but for comic book fans who haven't played it yet, Injustice is worth picking up . Can’t wait to see Batman take on Superman on the big screen in a couple of years? Then this is for you. Developed by the team behind the acclaimed last-gen Mortal Kombat remake, this beat-em-up lets you play as some of the world’s most famous superheroes. All are beautifully recreated and have trademark moves that stay true to their roots. Batman, for example, can call in the Batmobile to run foes over – while The Flash can sprint around the world before upper-cutting his opponent in the face. There are plenty of levels, too, ranging from Superman’s ice cave and the dark, back streets of Gotham, to the Justice League HQ that floats miles above the Earth. Each stage is multi-tiered with stunning 'transitional moves' used to unlock each area. Fights are cleverly interwoven into a strong narrative, too – so, unlike Xbox One exclusive Killer Instinct (which, in fairness, is targeting a slightly different audience), there’s plenty of incentive to play on your own. Knack 2/5 . Haven't got the knack of it: At times Knack looks great - but, similar to Ryse; Son of Rome, there's no depth . There is always going to be one dud in a launch line-up, and this year it’s Knack. Don’t be charmed by its (semi) impressive visuals, for this bland platformer offers nothing apart from repetitive combat and boring platforming elements. Most of the game is spent strolling through levels and dodging attacks. Tedious enough, but made even worse by frequent slowdown. In its defence, there is some variation in the level design – ranging from ice caves to forests – and at times it can look rather pretty. But it’s lacking the 'soul' and charm of, say, Putty Squad. Avoid. Need for Speed Rivals 4/5 . Burn rubber: In Rivals you can choose to play as a Cop or a Racer, then zoom around in the world's fastest cars . ‘Where are the slow motion crashes of Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit?’ some fans may ask. No matter, as this stunning racer gets nearly everything else perfect. Set in the open-world of Redview County, you can choose to be either a Cop or a Racer. The former is tasked with bringing as many Racers to justice – helped with a variety of Pursuit tech. These range from roadblocks to calling in Police choppers. Racers, on the other hand, have their own weapons – such as EMPS and other evasion tech. It also introduces the AllDrive system, where players can seamlessly transfer from playing on their own to playing with the online community. Graphically, it looks stunning – and runs arguably smoother than on Xbox One. The star of the show, though, are the cars. Speed through a puddle, and you’ll be treated to every last drop of water delicately sliding down their pixel-perfect chassis. Whereas Forza focused on simulation, Rivals portrays its exotic cars as grunting beasts that need manhandling if you're to tame Redview's challenging corners. Thanks to an in-game GPS system, you’re constantly given the shortest routes to objectives – be that other races or time trails, so you’re never out of the action for long. Battlefield 4 4/5 . What a view: This shot, taken from the opening level, is one of the most memorable sights in the single-player campaign. Still, most will skip this and dive straight into the glorious multiplayer . The campaign may have been a bit of a mixed bag with critics (I, for one, enjoyed it), but there is no doubt this is the best first-person multiplayer game around at the moment. Thanks to the PS4’s superior power, you can play with 32 players on each side – meaning the large maps are much less sparse than on current gen. Powered by the ‘full fat’ Frostbite 3 Engine, it looks wonderful, too – just a fraction behind the very top PC versions. You’ll often be torn between choosing COD or Battlefield, but this year, Battlefield is a clear winner. LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 5/5 . Look out below! The Hulk takes on Sandman in the brilliant LEGO Marvel Super Heroes . Another epic super hero game – this time a bit more tongue in cheek. Yes, it’s been out for a while and is on Xbox One – but those who opt for this system will be hard-pressed to find a more enjoyable platformer. Featuring an eclectic mix of the best-known heroes and a glorious open-world to explore, this will keep the kids happy for a long time. Closing thoughts . So, which console has the better line up? Clearly both sides have strengths and weaknesses. Ryse: Son of Rome on Xbox One is a graphical masterpiece for the most part, but suffers from linear gameplay. But the Xbox claws back serious points with Forza 5. The PS4, however, has a genuine classic in Killzone: Shadow Fall, something perhaps lacking with the Xbox launch titles. The line-up is somewhat let down by Knack - a game that at one stage showed some promise - but this still fares better than both Crimson Dragon and Lococycle on Xbox One.

Strong variety of games - pity that Drive Club was delayed ."
"It's finally here. The Xbox One has hit the shelves and those lucky enough to have a console on launch day must decide what games are worth getting. Whether it's showing off the best graphics, or picking the best shooter, MailOnline runs the rule over the top launch titles. Ryse: Son of Rome (Best visuals) Its development has been plagued with issues - notably moving from a Kinect-centered game to a third-person hack and slash. And it shows. Combat is extremely repetitive, enemies all look the same and game menus are bewildering. Stunning: there is no doubting just how good Ryse looks in parts - especially this early battle scene . Those issues aside, there's still a lot of fun to be had here. Using a more primitive version of a combat system found in the likes of Assassin's Creed - melee revolves around countering enemy blows before unleashing various sword attacks. When their health is low, you can execute them in a variety of ways - ranging from severing limbs clean off, to a quick slit of the throat. All these are rendered in eye-popping detail thanks to the CryEngine 3. Graphically it's mostly stunning. The early levels, in particular, will leave most in awe of the sheer scale of the battles. It does, however, taper off towards the end - a town-based level in particular, looks unfinished and shrouded in fog. Level design is to be desired, too. You're never really given the chance to explore the wonderfully-realized environments - rather, you're shunted along from one battle to the next. It's a shame, given that some of the most memorable parts of Ryse's storyline are away from the monotonous combat. Hack and slash: combat does get repetitive, but the execution mechanic is still quite enjoyable . Controls are responsive enough (although the lack of a jump button may annoy) while the optional function of shouting orders through Kinect isn't as smooth as it should be. Still, if you want a game that looks very pretty... Forza Motorsport (Best racer) No launch title on Xbox One perhaps best shows off the console's power more than Forza. With more than 200 photo-realistic cars, 14 circuits and stunning full HD graphics, there is plenty under Forza's hood to hit the right (engine) notes with race fans. Running at 60 frames per second (last-gen games usually ran at 30FPS), racing is incredibly smooth and environments, stunning. Real or fake? You'll often be asking that yourself when looking at Forza's glorious visuals . On close inspection, some of the minor details - such as vegetation and trees - still look extremely dated, but you'll be whizzing past them so quickly, it's unlikely to bother you. The nifty Drivatar feature lets you upload your driving to the Xbox One cloud - recording intricate details about how you drive so that other people around the world can challenge a virtual 'you' to a race, any time they like. Killer Instinct (Best beat-em-up - it's the only one so far!) It may lack a single-player mode and a vast array of characters to choose from, but this resurrection of a Nintendo 64 classic is still great fun. Plus, it's FREE if you're happy to play as one character. If you want more, you have buy them. At launch, the full-game comes with six characters, with eight more soon after as downloadable content. Fight club: there is no single player campaign, with gameplay centering around taking on human foes . Combat is frenetic, focusing on a breaker system and 'locking' into combination chains. It takes some time to master, but it's incredibly satisfying when you string together moves. Graphically, apart from solid 60fps frame rate and the odd finely-detailed particle, there's nothing really 'next-gen' about the visuals. It's still pleasing on the eye, though, and great fun with a friend. Battlefield 4  (Best first-person shooter) This may have been out for a while on last-gen, but if you haven't played it on PC, it'll be worth a look on Xbox One. If you're into your multiplayer gaming, the Xbox One version can house 64 players per server - doubling that found in last generation's version. Fall of Duty: the next-gen version of Battlefield looks stunning - thanks to a full-fat Frostbite 3 Engine . The campaign looks much better, too, thanks to a full-fat Frostbite 3 Engine - not the scaled down version used on Xbox 360 and PS3. There are still problems in the single-player campaign with the AI, though. Enemies will run right past your teammates and make a beeline . for you, take cover right next to your squad mates and launch grenades . at every given minute. But these gripes don't massively detract from the experience. Battlefield 4 is a compelling package - and more than worthy of checking out on Xbox One. FIFA 14 (Best sports game) If you have this for last-gen consoles, then there's very little point picking this up at launch. Graphics are sharper, thanks to EA's Ignite Engine, and the game runs more smoothly. That being said, multiplayer matches may be harder to pin down, given that most people will be playing on Xbox 360 still. Back of the net: but apart from the odd visuals tweak, stick with your last-gen copy of the game if you have it . Other sports games such as NBA2K14, though, look noticeably better on the Xbox One - and should be considered if you're after something different. Lego: Marvel Superheroes (Best kids' game) It looked stunning on the last crop of consoles, and looks even better on Xbox One. Yes, TT Games have delivered another brilliant LEGO game - and thanks to an impressive roster of heroes, including the X-Men, Iron Man and the Hulk - it's sure to be a hit with comic book fans old and young. Awesome: it already looked great on last-gen, but Marvel Superheroes looks its best on Xbox One . The best LEGO game yet...and essential if you don't own it yet. Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag (Best adventure game) Black Flag may seem like an act of . desperation from Ubisoft, hoping to get the Assassin’s Creed franchise . back on track, but this is the best Assassin’s Creed title to date and . one of the finest releases we’ve seen in 2013. Whale of a time: Black Flag is a great game, but it's worth experiencing how the developers intended it to look . On Xbox One, there's a host of next-gen features, thanks to Direct X 11. Expect the game to look sharper and run at 60FPS. Indeed, the difference is so stark, that it may be worth trading in your current copy and upgrading... especially if you're still early on in the game. Last words... Microsoft have a wide range of games available to suit all tastes. But don't forget the Xbox 360. For those put off by the hefty £429 price tag, the 360 offers an enormous games library for a fraction of the price. Top titles such as Grand Theft Auto 5, Halo 4, Red Dead Redemption and Deus Ex: Human Revolution can be picked up quite cheaply, and are better quality games than all of the launch titles. Plus, Microsoft will still make games for the 360 for a couple more years, so you'll never really be out of the loop if you opt for / stick with the older hardware. That is... until Titanfall and Halo 5 are released. PS. Avoid these games on the Xbox One: Crimson Dragon and . Lococycle.

"More than 50 British Muslim charities are being covertly observed over fears they may be linked to extremism and radicalisation. In the last two years, charity regulator the Charity Commission has marked 55 charities with an issue code called 'extremism and radicalisation', without the knowledge of the organisations concerned. And of the 44 ongoing investigations launched by the regulator since January 2013, 17 concern Muslim-linked charities. More than 50 British Muslim charities are being observed over fears they may be linked to extremism, while five organisations working in Syria, including al-Fatiha Global which British hostage Alan Henning was working with when he was kidnapped, are the focus of ongoing statutory inquiries by the Charity Commission . Five British charities working in Syria, including al-Fatiha Global which British hostage Alan Henning was working with when he was kidnapped last December, are also the focus of ongoing statutory inquiries. The figures were revealed in a request under the Freedom of Information Act by think tank Claystone, which works to promote social cohesion for British Muslims. It says the new issue code was introduced in December 2012, three months after Sir William Shawcross was appointed as chairman of the Commission that September. The following year, Sir William brought in a new board, including former Metropolitan Police counter terrorism chief Peter Clarke, and he has described the cause of Islamic extremism as the 'most deadly' faced by the charity sector. 'The Commission has labelled 55 charities with the issue code ""extremism and radicalisation"" without their knowledge,' writes Claystone's Adam Belaon in his report, 'Muslim Charities: A Suspect Sector'. Cracking down: The issue code was introduced in December 2012, three months after Sir William Shawcross (left) was appointed as chairman of the Commission, while former Metropolitan Police counter terrorism chief Peter Clarke (right) sits on the watchdog's board . 'This means the Commission has flagged up 55 charities which will be monitored as a potential concern for matters relating to extremism and radicalisation in the period December 5th 2012 to May 8th 2014. 'The criteria for applying and removing this issue code is not in a written form which can be scrutinised. We were informed that “an issue code is applied solely on the basis of the subject and type of allegations or concerns that have come to the attention of the Commission"".' In his report, Mr Balaon said Muslim charities had been 'disproportionately affected' by investigations, and that some of the charities being monitored by the Commission had been subjected to questioning over tenuous links to extremist clerics. Pledge: Last month David Cameron said the Charity Commission would receive an extra £8million and tougher powers . Quoting a trustee of an unnamed charity, the report states: 'We were questioned at length about different religious clerics who in most cases had done nothing more than deliver one lecture at a fundraising event some time in the past for us. We were quoted snippets from lectures they had given at events that were nothing to do with us and asked to provide explanations.' Another had told the report authors: 'It felt like the assumption was we were apologists for extremists unless we could justify why we weren’t. If the Commission felt that unlawful speech had been used they should have gone to the Police with their quotes.' Last month, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged that the Charity Commission would receive an extra £8million and tougher powers to put the squeeze on bogus good causes which divert cash to terrorism and other criminal activity. An automatic ban on anyone with convictions for certain criminal offences becoming a trustee of a charity is one of the changes included in a draft Protection of Charities Bill - as well as the power for the Commission to disqualify anyone they consider unfit. It will also be allowed to shut down charities under investigation to protect public confidence, to issue an official warning in less serious cases and to prevent people resigning to avoid disqualification before returning in another guise. That same month, Sir William said there was a 'risk' that money donated by members of the public had been sent to fighters with the so-called Islamic State, and said the watchdog was scrutinising 86 charities at risk from extremism, including 37 working with Syria victims. But Mr Balaon said: 'Thus far there has been no empirical evidence to substantiate concerns that British Muslim charities are surreptitiously operating with the purpose of supporting terrorist or extremist activities.' A Commission spokesman told MailOnline: 'The Commission does not target Muslim, any other religion or type of charity. All our casework is prioritised and assessed for action against the Risk Framework, published on the website. We are keen to remove the perception that this is not the case. 'A full analysis of the Commission's compliance work including investigative and monitoring work for the last financial year will be in this year's publication Tackling Abuse and Mismanagement.'","Charity Commission marks 55 British charities with new issue code 'extremism and radicalisation' without organisations' knowledge .

"Two brothers were among the four workers that were killed during a hazardous chemical leak at a Texas industrial plant. Robert and Gilbert Tisnado reportedly worked side by side at the plant with both tragically perishing after Gilbert tried to save his younger brother's life with a gas mask. Friends and neighbors spoke of the brothers' popularity and kindness. Tragic: Robert (left) and his brother Gilbert Tisnado (right) were both killed during a chemical leak at a Texas industrial plant . Albert Davis told Kvue.com: 'Robert lived for his family. I don't know anybody who spent as much time with his family.' Robert had three children and Gilbert was a grandfather, the news site said. One person was injured during the leak. The chemical, methyl mercaptan, began leaking around 4am on Saturday morning in a unit at the DuPont plant in La Porte, about 20 miles east of Houston. Plant officials said the release was contained by 6am. Several employees had responded to the leak when they were exposed to the chemical, plant manager Randall Clements said in a statement. Shocking: Four workers have been killed and one injured following the leak of a hazardous chemical at a DuPont plant in La Porte, 20 miles east of Houston, Texas . Spread: Several employees had responded to the leak when they were exposed to the chemical. It could be smelt 40 miles away, but officials insist it was not a danger to the public . 'There are no words to fully express the loss we feel or the concern and sympathy we extend to the families of the employees and their co-workers,' Clements said. 'We are in close touch with them and providing them every measure of support and assistance at this time.' The injured person's condition was not immediately known.According to ABC 13, one of them had been working at the plant for 40 years. Methyl mercaptan was used at the plant to create crop-protection products such as insecticides and fungicides, according to DuPont. The cause of the leak was not immediately known. Clements said DuPont would be cooperating with local, state and federal officials investigating the leak. 'As part of that investigation, we are conducting our own top-to-bottom review of this incident and we will share what we learn with the relevant authorities,' he said. Identities: The names of the other victims have not yet been released, although reports suggested one of the casualties had been working at the plant for around 40 years. The sign outside reads: 'Safety is a core value' Jeff Suggs, emergency management coordinator for La Porte, said the chemical release was not toxic for those living nearby, but that it caused a smell that's similar to rotten eggs. 'It's a nuisance smell in the area. It's a smell that's traveled quite far,' Suggs said. Methyl mercaptan is also commonly used to odorize natural gas — which has no odor — for safety purposes. The La Porte plant has 320 DuPont employees. Four other companies are also tenants at the complex.","Employees were exposed at the DuPont plant in LaPorte near Houston .

"A Utah man faces five to 40 years in federal prison after pleading guilty Monday to flying 242 pounds of marijuana from northern California, which was intercepted at a small western Pennsylvania airport. Fifty-four-year-old Ken Burrows, of Provo, Utah, pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute marijuana in federal court in Pittsburgh. The pot, worth about $1.2 million, was in sealed plastic containers. Burrows claimed to be flying hot water tanks as cargo. Federal prosecutors say Burrows was recruited to fly the drugs to the East Coast. Busted: Ken Burrows, pictured, claimed to be flying hot water tanks as cargo when he was apprehended by authorities . U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents intercepted the drugs when Burrows landed his Cessna on December 13 at New Castle Municipal Airport, about 45 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. Last December following Burrows' arrest, Lawrence County District Attorney Josh Lamancusa told TribLive.com '[Burrows] flew at low altitude, zigzagging across the country to avoid radar towers.' Lamancusa also told the newspaper 'He had blacked-out windows. He was landing at smaller airports to refuel.' Burrows' plane was followed by officials with Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection, who were in a helicopter, Lancusa told the newspaper. He told TribLive.com the agents interviewed Burrow after his plane stopped to fuel up. 'We determined there was sufficient evidence to bring out a dog,' Lancusa said at the time. Jim Morris, the police chief for Mahoning Township, told TribLive last December following Burrows' arrest 'The dog hit very strong on the airplane. When he got to the luggage compartment, he immediately sat down and turned his head towards his handler.' CBS Pittsburgh last December reported Burrows' plane was flown by authorities to meet with the potential drug buyer and that he had complied with Homeland Security. Lamancusa told the affiliate station 'We allowed Mr. Burrows to be in a separate helicopter to meet the plane at the final destination. Once they touched down, Mr. Burrows then got into the plane, completed the transaction with the target in Rhode Island and he was arrested there.' He's scheduled to be sentenced February 15.

"Sir Mark Walport (pictured), David Cameron's personal scientific . adviser, has said that the rise of genetically modified food is . 'inexorable' Calls to relax the rules on GM crops were backed yesterday by the nation’s chief scientist. Sir Mark Walport said the rise of genetically modified food was ‘inexorable’ and there was a ‘strong case’ for it to be grown in Britain. So far biotech firms have been deterred from growing GM crops in Europe by the tightest controls in the world. But controversially Sir Mark, who is David Cameron’s personal scientific adviser, said the food was proving its worth and production is increasing globally. ‘It is inexorably rising up the agenda . again because as a technology it is showing its value more and more, . obviously in terms of the crops that are able to feed the world,’ he . added. ‘The job of a scientific adviser is to set out the scientific case and that scientific case is becoming stronger and stronger.’ But . Peter Riley, of campaign group GM Freeze, said: ‘The public remains . extremely sceptical about the safety of GM foods and the benefits that . are said to come from them. Politicians and scientific leaders need to look at other food options that do not come with such a large risk. ‘The push for GM is being orchestrated by large industry rather than in the interest of the consumer or public health.’ Sir Mark said it was his ‘job to advise on the science and it is then the politician’s job to decide how to use that ... The final decision is a political decision’. His comments – in his first public speech in the job – are the latest indication that the GM lobby is rapidly gaining influence after years of public hostility. Sir Mark Walport, in his first public speech in the role as Cameron's (right) scientific adviser, said there was a ‘strong scientific case’ for GM crops to be grown in Britain and that GM food is proving its worth globally . Doubts: Campaigners say that the public is still not convinced that GM foods are safe to eat . Earlier this month, four major supermarkets ended bans on farm suppliers giving GM feed to animals producing meat, milk and eggs. The vast majority of those foods sold in Britain will now come from animals raised on a GM diet.However, a survey by the Food Standards Agency last year found two in three people believe food from animals given a GM diet should be described as such. And a British Science Association study showed public support for so-called Frankenstein Foods declining from 46 per cent in 2002 to just 27 per cent now. Campaign groups have also raised concerns over ministers’ secret meetings with GM lobby groups – details of which emerged only following freedom of information requests. Supporter: Environment Secretary Owen Patterson said last year that he is a keen proponent of GM foods . Environment Secretary Owen Paterson last year came out as keen proponent of GM crops, dismissing consumer fears as ‘humbug’. And, days ago, scientists called on ministers to back technology which could produce genetically modified salmon, pigs and cattle. Speaking after his address to the University of Cambridge’s centre for science and policy’s annual conference, Sir Mark said GM crops could provide important potential benefits for food production. He added: ‘For every genetic modification you have to ask what plant, what gene and for what purpose. The case will be strong for some and not strong for others. Each case has be decided on its merits.’ Asked for examples of crops that would benefit British farming, Sir Mark said: ‘If it were possible for instance to develop a blight-resistant potato, then that would be a valuable thing to do.’ He also said that ‘golden rice’ –genetically modified rice that contains higher levels of vitamin A to reduce blindness and other diseases in the developing world – had ‘been around for some time’. Biotech firms such as Monsanto have ensured that 80 per cent of the soya grown in the US and Brazil is GM. It is one of the reasons why British supermarkets have now been forced to allow GM-fed produce into the food chain. New rules: Earlier this month, four major supermarkets ended bans on farm suppliers giving GM feed to chickens . The first GM meat and fish could also go on sale this summer. Authorities in the US are expected to grant approval to Aquabounty salmon, which has been modified to grow twice as fast as normal. For shoppers who refuse to buy meat, milk and eggs from animals fed on GM, the only alternative may be to buy more expensive organic produce. GM crop farming has been shown to harm bees, butterflies and other insects in UK trials and on farms across the US, where many have become blighted with superweeds. Sir Mark, 60, was director of the Wellcome Trust from 2003 to 2013 and has headed the Division of Medicine at Imperial College London. In 2009, he was knighted for services to medical research.","Sir Mark Walport says the rise of GM foods is 'inexorable'

"She has been delivering seamless speeches to the nation for more than 60 years. So when the 87-year-old Queen stumbled over her words during the State Opening of Parliament yesterday, she might just have been having an off day. But – as she prepares to scale back her public duties – some will see it as a symptom of her advancing years. Scroll down for videos . Looking regal: Camilla and Charles arrive dressed in dazzling outfits . In a rare slip-up, the Queen faltered over half a dozen words during the seven-and-a-half minute oration at the Palace of Westminster in front of peers and MPs. Two minutes into her 60th speech for the Opening of Parliament, she tripped up over the words ‘infrastructure’ and ‘availability’. Perhaps unnerved by her earlier stumbles, she then appeared to stammer over the words ‘take’ and ‘contribute’, before struggling with the word ‘government’ twice towards the end of the speech. Prince Charles, who was attending his first State Opening in 17 years, is expected to take on more of his mother’s tasks – and yesterday his wife Camilla in a dazzling tiara looked very much like a Queen in waiting at his side.

She still conducts more than 300 engagements each year, although she is understood to be gradually scaling back her diary. Palace aides have denied that the Queen’s recent ill-health, when she was hospitalised in March with gastroenteritis, has influenced the decision to cut back on her overseas travel. As well as looking after her own health, she is said to be concerned not to put too much strain on her husband, Prince Philip, who will be 92 next month and still accompanies her on most trips.

The special measures are already in place for travelers arriving from three other West African nations - Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea.

Passengers arriving in the US from Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guine, and now Mali, will undergo temperature and symptom checks for Ebola (stock image) 'A large number of individuals may have been exposed to those cases,' the statement said. 'The action is warranted as a precaution due to the possibility that other cases of Ebola may emerge in Mali in the coming days,' the statement said, adding that CDC will continue to reassess the measure. The United States said there are about 15-20 travelers who depart Mali each day en route to the United States. Officials said travelers entering the United States from Mali also will be subject to the 21-day monitoring and movement protocols already in effect for travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, with mandatory twice daily temperature and symptom checks in coordination with state and local public health authorities .

Glenn Miller Jr, 73, (pictured at an April court hearing) said that he went to Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City and a nearby Jewish retirement home 'for the specific purpose of killing Jews' Miller Jr, pictured in April, was jailed in Johnson County on a charge of capital murder for the April 13 attacks . 'I was convinced there would be all Jews or mostly Jews' at the two centers', he said, but added that the attacks still accomplished his goal of making 'Jews feel less secure'. The 73-year-old said he had staked out the centers for days before the attacks. Miller, who also goes by the name Frazier Glenn Cross Jr, was jailed in Johnson County on a charge of capital murder in the April 13 attacks. A preliminary hearing that was scheduled for last week was delayed so Miller could undergo a mental evaluation. Miller is accused of killing Dr William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood, who were at the community center in Leawood for a singing contest audition. He also is accused of fatally shooting 53-year-old Terri LaManno, who was visiting her mother at the retirement home in Overland Park. Miller said he decided to carry out the attacks because it was something he wanted to do before he died. He said he suffers from emphysema and became concerned that he didn't have much time left during an emergency room visit in late March. He said his one regret was the death of the 'young white boy,' and several times during the interviews, Miller said he thought Reat Underwood was older. 'The 14-year-old boy, he looked 20,' he said. Dr William Lewis Corporan, and his grandson Reat Griffin Underwood (left) were at the Jewish Community Center for a singing competition when they were killed while Terri LaManno (right) was visiting her mother at a Jewish assisted living facility . Miller originally said he would not speak on the record unless The Star agreed to send a copy of the recorded interview to a longtime friend of his. The Star refused, and Miller eventually consented to an interview without any conditions. The Southern Poverty Law Center said Miller has been immersed in white supremacy most of his life. During the early 1980s, Cross was 'one of the more notorious white supremacists in the U.S.,' according to the Anti-Defamation League. He founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and served as its 'grand dragon' before launching the supremacist White Patriot Party, the law center said. By 1987, he was the target of a nationwide manhunt for violating terms of his bond while appealing a North Carolina conviction for operating a paramilitary camp. Federal agents tracked him along with three other men to a rural Missouri mobile home stocked with hand grenades, automatic weapons and thousands of bullets. A federal grand jury indicted Miller on weapons charges and accused him of plotting robberies and the assassination of the law center's founder, Morris Dees. He then served three years in federal prison. As part of a plea bargain, he testified against other Klan leaders in a 1988 sedition trial. Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe and Miller's lawyer, Ron Evans, said they were precluded from commenting because of a judicial gag order.","F.

"Voting UKIP could wipe thousands of pounds of house prices, the Tories have claimed ahead of Thursday’s crunch Rochester by-election. The warning, following claims house prices slumped in parts of east London after the BNP won a swathe of council seats, came as George Osborne led a last-ditch push for the Tories to cling on in the crucial contest. The Chancellor was joined by Commons Leader William Hague campaigning in Kent in an attempt to hold back the rising Ukip tide ahead of Thursday's vote, triggered by the defection of Tory MP Mark Reckless. George Osborne visited digger attachment firm Masterhitch  in an attempt to shore up support for the Tories . The Chancellor was campaigning for Conservative Kelly Tolhurst, who is struggling to hold back the rising Ukip tide . With Ukip now almost certain to win the by-election, senior Conservatives are now focussed on trying to stop Nigel Farage's party from winning by more than 10 per cent. Tories have claimed voters in the town are increasingly concerned that Rochester and Strood could be tainted by voting Ukip. Charles Walker, the MP for Broxbourne, who was campaigning in the town this afternoon said: ‘The danger is if you vote Ukip, the value of your house will go down.’ Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst said the concern had been raised by voters. She told the Telegraph: ‘I have heard a few people say that to me, but I'm not getting into that. But Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, said: ‘It's an absurd utterance, from a candidate who fails to impress. The Tories' desperation has reached new levels. It's not going to impress anyone.’ Several Cabinet ministers and MPs are expected in the Rochester and Strood seat in the next three days in an attempt to prevent the second embarrassing defeat to Ukip. Douglas Carswell became the first elected Ukip MP last month when he won the Clacton by-election he called after defecting from the Tories. The Tories promised to 'throw the kitchen sink' at winning the seat, with David Cameron accusing Mr Reckless of betraying activists who worked to get his 'fat arse' on the Commons benches. But Ukip have remained ahead in the constituency ever since Mr Reckless announced he was switching parties on the eve of the Tory party conference. Immigration and Europe have dominated the campaign, with Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst struggling to hold Ukip back. Miss Tolhurst was also joined on the campaign trail by Commons Leader William Hague . Polls have put the Ukip lead on between nine and 15 points in recent weeks. Ukip insiders insist they have not predicted a 15 per cent victory, which they admit would be a 'big ask'. But they are increasingly confident of a double-digit lead, which would make it harder for the Tories to win the seat back at next year's general election.Mr Osborne sought to put the emphasis on the economy and employment, with a visit to digger attachment firm Masterhitch. During the tour, the Chancellor warned Britain is not immune to the problems facing the global economy, but insisted the Tories have a plan for the future. He told reporters: 'You have to make a realistic assessment of the global economy today. We've discovered that Japan has gone into recession, Europe remains very weak, and although the British economy is performing well we're not immune to these things happening in the world. 'It's all the more reason why we've got to go on working through our long term economic plan and why it would be a complete disaster to divert from that plan, to borrow and spend more. 'That would put Britain in a place where many other countries find themselves today. 'People know that the deficit has come down by more than a third. And if we want to go on reducing our deficit, seeing jobs being created in our country. 'We have to go on working through the long term economic plan because with the red lights flashing that warning on the dashboard of the global economy we know we mustn't divert course.' Mark Reckless is on course to become Ukip's second elected MP in Thursday's by-election, which was triggered by his defection from the Tories in September . Sir John Major yesterday claimed Ukip is 'profoundly un-British in every way'. The former Conservative Prime Minister blasted the 'sheer nastiness' of Mr Farage's party and said it was 'anti-everything... anti-politics, anti-foreigner, anti-immigrant, anti-aid'. Sir John told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: 'I think many of the people who are voting for them are doing so out of frustration at the ongoing difficulties of the recession, the belief that they are losing out and falling behind. 'That will fade away as the economy improves, and it is materially improving.' In his strongly-worded attack he added: 'The policies of Ukip, the direction of Ukip, is, it seems to me, profoundly un-British in every way. 'They are anti-everything. They are anti-politics, they are anti-foreigner, they are anti-immigrant, they are anti-aid. 'I don't know what they are for, we know what they are against. That's the negativity of the four-ale bar, that's not the way to get into Parliament and not the way to run a country. 'So they may be elected because people are frustrated.'","MP Charles Walker warns voting Ukip could taint town hitting house prices .

"An air force veteran who had to leave active duty after being blown up twice in roadside bomb attacks now captures the portraits of other veterans as a form of 'therapy'. Stacy Pearsall, a retired US Air Force staff sergeant, suffered a devastating neck injury after being involved in IED attacks in Baghdad in February 2004 and March 2007. Recurring neck pain forced her to leave active duty, and she risked falling into depression. Unforgettable: Stacy Pearsall, a retired U.S. Air Force sergeant who was forced out of active duty after being involved in two bomb attacks in Baghdad, now takes portrait photographs of fellow veterans, like the shirtless solider seen above staring at his uniform . In all his glory: An officer stands in shadow dressed in his full military uniform . 'Therapy': Mrs Pearsall said taking pictures of other veterans was a therapeutic activity for her . She said: 'When I left the military it was not on my terms and it was a very dark period. 'Military service was my life. When it got taken away from me it was like having the wind taken out of my sails.' However, Mrs Pearsall, 34, was able to stay connected to the military through her love of photography and began meeting and photographing veterans from the Second World War to the present. Since August 2008 she has photographed more than 100 veterans of various conflicts for a series she has named 'Veterans Portraits'. She said: 'I turned to portrait photography. I never anticipated it to be therapy but it was.' Mrs Pearsall was just two weeks away from returning home after a tour of duty in Iraq when she was involved in the first bomb attack. Family bond: A veteran smiles as his daughter plans a kiss on his cheek as he balances her on his knee . Paying the cost: A veteran with a prosthetic leg stands proud and similes broadly for the camera . Injured but not defeated: A disabled veteran looks lost in thought as he sits in his wheelchair . Playing around: A former pilot gestures with a model airplane while resting on a chair; Mrs Pearsall said soldiers often opened up to her about their wartime experiences while having their pictures taken . Good on ya: A veteran winks at the photographer as he has a close-up picture taken of his face . She said: 'I walked away from the explosion and didn't realise how badly I was injured. I didn't know it at the time, but when I was hit I seriously injured my neck and sustained brain trauma.' Having returned home, she was cooking dinner when she realised just how seriously she had been hurt. She said:' The world flipped upside down. I fell to the floor, and had no idea what was going on.' Despite being diagnosed with vertigo, she was still deemed fit enough to return to Baghdad in 2007 where she again had a narrow escape. After being involved in the second incident, Mrs Pearsall was forced to retire in 2008. In August that year her medical care was transferred to a Veterans' Administration Hospital where she began meeting other veterans and exchanging stories. At first, veterans thought she must have been there to visit a relative. What a character: A veteran with a walking frame, wore sunglasses and a cap to have his picture taken . Proud: An injured soldier, quietly poses for his picture; Mrs Pearsall approached organisations, including The Veterans' Health Administration, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion and the United Services Automobile Association to fund her portrait project . Way back when: A veteran holds a small photo of him taking during his time in the service . Next generation: A female solider poses for her portrait as her daughter hides under her chair . She said: 'I got to know a World War Two veteran. He leaned over and asked if I was there to support my grandfather. He was surprised when I told him I was actually the veteran. We soon began trading stories. 'This encounter made me realise a lot of people have a specific idea of what a veteran should look like - but despite the physical differences between me and him we shared many of the same experiences.' Mrs Pearsall then approached organisations, including The Veterans' Health Administration, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion and the United Services Automobile Association to fund her portrait project. Mrs Pearsall, of Goose Creek, South Carolina, said while having their picture taken, veterans often opened-up about their experiences. She recalled: 'A Vietnam veteran once came in for a portrait and told me his job was to identify bodies which were mutilated beyond recognition. War creates horror beyond comprehension. 'I hadn't noticed at the time but as he told me this his wife was in the corner of the room, crying. Afterwards she hugged me and told me she had lived with him for decades but had never been told about his experiences in the war. 'Why he chose to talk about it at that specific point in time I will never know. I just listened.' Mrs Pearsall continues to travel around America, photographing her fellow veterans.","Stacy Pearsall was a sergeant in the U.S. Air Force when she was injured .

"By . Donna Sawyer . A 41-year-old elephant has been introduced to its another of its kind for the first time in over three decades. Mila met Mary, the leader of the herd at San Diego Zoo, after being kept as a lone elephant in a circus for over 30 years and then taken in by Franklin Zoo in New Zealand. Video footage of the heart-warming meeting shows the African elephants entwining their trunks through a wire fence. Scroll down for video . Kindred spirits: Mila meets herd leader Mary at San Diego Zoo after being kept as a lone elephant in a circus for over 30 years . It is common for elephants to communicate by touching and entwining their trunks, according to African Elephant expert Tim Fullman's website. He writes that trunks 'play an important role in smell and that rubbing trunks in greeting may be partially to smell each other to gain information.' Mila's former keeper Helen Schofield, who was crushed to death by Mila in an accident in 2012, had always hoped the elephant would one day be returned to a herd of its own kind. The tragic incident sparked a fundraising effort by supporters of the zoo, who hoped to raise enough money for Mila to be relocated to a zoo with that had other African elephants. The supporters raised $1.5 million, enough for Mila to be moved from New Zealand to San Diego Zoo. Friendship grows: Mila entwines trunks with the matriach of the herd Mary in a heart-warming scene . Touching trunks: It is common for elephants to communicate to each other by touching and entwining their trunks . Elephant talk: Trunks play an important role in smell and this greeting may be to smell each other to gain information . San Diego Zoo's African elephant herd includes six African and Indian elephants ranging in age from 33 to 49 years old. Lead keeper at the zoo Ron Ringer says that so far, Mila and Mary are really hitting it off. 'Mary walked up to Mila and they both started eating from the same tree,' Mr Ringer said. 'This is a great behavior to see because they were both calm and accepting of each other and it’s one of the types of things we look for with animal introductions.' Accidental death: Mila's former keeper Helen Schofield was crushed to death by the elephant in an accident in 2012 . Zoo keepers felt the best way to introduce Mila to the herd was to start with a one-on-one with the matriach. 'In late January, we gave Mila the first opportunity to meet another elephant with limited interaction. We decided that Mary was the best option, given she is a dominant elephant in the herd, is relatively calm, and has a good track record with meeting newcomers.' 'Being excited, nervous, scared, aggressive, or submissive were all possibilities we could have expected to observe,' zookeeper Robbie Clark said. 'Mary was curious of the newbie while Mila was surprised to find something as big as her on the other side of the wall!'","41-year-old elephant meets another elephant for the first time in 37 years .

"This dramatic video shows how a car thief managed to evade the police forces of two countries for more than an hour as he travelled at over 150mph after stealing a high-powered BMW  in Germany. The driver, described as a professional car thief from Lithuania, was eventually caught when he realised he was running out of petrol - and had to dump the car and run away on foot. German police have been staging a crackdown on the theft of luxury cars by eastern European car thieves and reacted quickly when it was reported that the BMW X6 had been stolen in the Bavarian town of Dachau and that the thief was heading eastwards down the motorway. Scroll down for video . Full speed ahead: A Lithuanian car thief leads police on a 150mph chase after stealing a  BMW in Germany . Quick getaway: German police zeroed in on the driver after it was reported that the BMW X6 had been stolen in the Bavarian town of Dachau and that the thief was heading eastwards down the motorway. The driver evades the police forces of two countries for more than an hour as he travelled at over 150mph . Seven German police cars zeroed in on the car which was travelling so fast that the thief managed to get across the border with the Czech Republic at the Rozvado crossing before officers could move to intercept him. Officers had radioed ahead to Czech colleagues who also tried to catch the speeding car, but again did not manage to overtake the high-performance German motor. However, he was unable to shake off the police pursuers completely because they had also called in a helicopter that was able to keep pace with the car on the ground and also to video his attempts to evade capture. The video shows at one point the car speeding down the motorway with a police car and its blue light flashing travelling behind at excessive speeds. Petrol dead: After realising he was running out of fuel, he leaves the road and succeeds to shake off the police pursuit cars, but he fails to shake off the helicopter . Desperate measures: The thief takes a knowing look at the helicopter before disappearing into woodland . On the run: He escapes on foot after dumping his car close to the Czech village of Cerhovice . On his last legs: The driver escapes on foot, pursued by six German police guards, seven from Czech city of Plzen and several policemen from the Czech highway department . And the BMW driver leaves the road and succeeds to shake off the police pursuit cars, but he fails to shake off the helicopter. In the end, running out of fuel, he dumped his car close to the central Czech village of Cerhovice, and tried to escape on foot but was quickly caught by police dogs who followed his trail into local woodland. Czech police spokeswoman Marcela Pucelikova said: 'At some points his speed was just over 240 km/h (150 mph). 'He was followed by six German police guards, seven from Czech city of Plzen and several policemen from the Czech highway department. Cornered: Eventually he is caught by a police car and dogs who followed his trail into woodland . Taken down: The driver was later identified as a 34-year-old Lithuanian with several convictions for car theft . 'In the end, he was arrested when he went on foot. He had identity papers on him but these turned out to have been stolen in Lithuania. 'It was only through further checks that he was identified as a 34-year-old Lithuanian man with several convictions for car theft in his homeland.' The thief is currently in investigative custody awaiting extradition back to Germany. The stolen BMW is also still in the Czech police pound awaiting shipment back to Germany in the next few days.","Police helicopter captures one-hour high-speed chase after thief steals BMW .

"Anne Cole, 71, was driving to hospital when she lost control of her car and ploughed into Hazel l'Anson, who was walking her dog, who was killed . A pensioner who killed a dog walker after suffering a diabetic fit behind the wheel of her car has escaped a prison sentence. Anne Cole, 71, was driving to a hospital appointment when she had a hypoglycaemic episode, which caused her to lose control of her car and mount a pavement in Leyland, Lancashire. The retired teacher narrowly missed a tipper truck at a mini roundabout before she ploughed into 51-year-old Hazel l'Anson as she walked her dog Zak in February. The grandmother and former teaching assistant, who was was hurled into Cole's windscreen before being thrown against a wall, was airlifted to hospital but died later from fatal head and chest injuries. When Cole, who suffers from Type 2 diabetes was interviewed by police, it emerged she may have been rendered totally incapable to drive due to a lack of blood sugar. She suffered from autonomic neuropathy which meant she did not have the warning signals to suggest that she was going to have a hypoglycaemic attack and paramedics did not check her blood levels at the time. Inquiries also revealed the Toyota Aygo automatic she had been driving was a courtesy car given to her on loan after she was involved in another road accident nine days earlier. She told Preston Crown Court that she had slowed down as she approached the roundabout 'as I generally do'. 'The next memory I have is being hit, a sense of being moved in one direction. I wasn't going of my own volition. I don't know what happened,' she said. 'All I can say is that it doesn't sound like my driving. I would never hurt anybody. I don't know what to say. It has just destroyed me.' Cole has not driven since the crash and has surrendered her driving licence. She was found guilty of causing death by careless driving and given a three year community order and was banned from driving for two years. She was also made subject to an order under Section 22 of the Road Traffic Act declaring her unfit to drive. However, after the sentencing, Mrs I'Anson's husband David, 60, a truck driver said: 'The sentence is ridiculous and she's not even been financially burdened. 'This medical condition she had has got her away scot-free and she has got off very lightly in my opinion. 'A community order for a life, for killing a mother and wife, to me is totally wrong. I don't think she realises what she has done.' 'She could have said something to us at court but she just let us walk past. That's the hardest bite, her not showing any remorse. Truck driver, David I'Anson, 60, whose wife Hazel was killed in the accident, said the sentence is 'ridiculous' 'She didn't even drop her head and start crying, when she came out I think she wanted to smile' He added: 'Hazel was the best mother and wife and my soulmate and the first thing I do when I walk through the door is look straight at the photo of her and say ""I hope you are in a better place"". 'If I could I would buy her back but I'm never going to get her back. This sentence doesn't reflect what has happened when there is a life involved.' A joint victim statements from Mrs I'Anson's sons Mark and Craig said: 'Life can never be the same again and it is not something we will ever get over, hopefully somehow we will learn to cope without mum. 'It seems impossible when everything seems to remind us of her.' Passing sentence Judge Michael Byrne told Cole: 'I make it plain if it were not for the medical condition that you are suffering, a sentence of imprisonment would be appropriate. 'Everybody no doubt wishes that they could turn the clock back and so undo the terrible tragedy that happened but that is not possible. Arriving a court, Anne Cole (left) and David l'Anson (right) ahead of her sentencing at Preston Crown Court . 'One family has lost a wife and mother through no fault of their own. Another a mother and grandmother held responsible for the events of that day. 'No sentence can ever compensate for a life lost and no life lost can ever be measured in terms of a sentence whether in prison or not. 'The sole cause of this fatal accident was the careless driving. There was no good reason why she should not have seen the truck in time but failed to do so. Instead she accelerated to try and get ahead of it and in doing so lost control of the vehicle.' 'This unfortunate tragedy may well have been caused by a hypoglycaemic episode, she was unaware she had had at the time.' The accident, which happened on February 12, 2013, was nine days after another crash where Cole 'overshot' a give way marking and collided with a car whilst on her way to see her daughter. There were injuries but her own car was damaged and she was given the automatic Toyota as a courtesy car. Witnesses to the tragedy said in the moments before the fatal impact Cole was involved in near miss at another mini roundabout where she failed to give way forcing a driver to slam on the brakes. Motorist, Sean Smith, said: 'She was just staring straight ahead did not make an eye contact - it was like the roundabout wasn't there.' A judge at Preston Crown Court found Cole guilty and handed her a community order and a driving ban . He then followed her only to see disaster strike at a second roundabout further down the road. A 32 tonne tipper truck driver had to brake and sound his horn as Cole drove across in front of him. She was then seen to 'put her head down' before her Toyota suddenly accelerated and swerved onto the pavement where Mrs I'Anson had no chance to get out of the way. Cole initially tried to claim another vehicle had crashed into the right-hand side of her car and knocked her across on to the pavement - but a thorough examination of the Toyota did not show any evidence it had been hit on the side. The wagon, which had to brake hard as Cole drove in front of it, had no damage either - and none of four independent witnesses to the accident saw any contact. It is thought Mrs I'Anson's dog returned home of its own accord after the accident. In mitigation defence counsel Miss Rachel Cooper said: 'Had she known she was suffering from this condition she simply would not have been driving. 'She expresses her remorse and sorrow for what happened. She accepts full responsibility for what happened because she was behind the wheel. 'It is something she lives with every day but Mrs I'Anson's family carry a heavier burden.'","Anne Cole, 71, was driving to hospital when she lost control of her car .

"A family who falsely claimed £226,000 in benefits in one of the worst frauds a judge has ever seen were caught after their daughter was seen swimming with dolphins - despite claiming she couldn't walk. Samuel Bennett and his wife Patricia, both 64, claimed disability living allowance between 2002 and 2012 on the basis they were so ill they could not walk and needed 24 hour care. But they had lied about their disabilities, and were going on luxury holidays abroad and driving high end cars including an Audi and a BMW, Liverpool Crown Court heard. Scroll down for video . A family who falsely claimed £226,000 in benefit caught out after their daughter was seen swimming with dolphins. Despite claiming she couldn't walk Danielle Bennett (pictured) was seen diving into swimming pools, pulling a child on a suitcase and working as a beautician . They had also claimed disability benefits for their daughter Danielle Bennett, 30, of Everton, since she was a child. The court was told when she was an adult she maintained the lies, saying she was virtually unable to walk, needed 24-hour care, had systemic sclerosis, arthritis, Raynaud's disease, psoriasis and depression. Samuel Bennett said he had heart problems, depression and asthma whilst his wife claimed to have arthritis, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome and a hiatus hernia. The couple, of West Derby, said they could only walk a few yards before falling over and needed sticks and other aids to do so. But they had lied about their supposed infirmities and had in fact embarked on nine luxury holidays over the period including to Australia, on a Caribbean cruise and to America three times. Samuel and Patricia Bennett (pictured) of West Derby, said they could only walk a few yards before falling over. But they were going on luxury holidays abroad and the family drove high end cars including an Audi and a BMW Liverpool Crown Court heard . Footage seized by Department for Work and Pensions showed no evidence of disability at all. It showed Danielle diving into swimming pools, pulling a child on a suitcase and working as a beautician.

Sentencing them at Liverpool Crown Court Judge Denis Watson, QC, said: 'In almost 30 years of my experience of the criminal courts this is the worst example of benefit fraud that I have personally had to deal with. 'You regarded the funds of the DWP, as it now is, as funds for your personal use. You employed repeated and blatant lies to obtain significant amounts of money.' Danielle, 30, was sentenced to 18 months in prison, Samuel nine months, and Patricia 27 months.","Benefits cheat family from Liverpool jailed for £226,000 scam over 10 years .

"Police officers have been advised not to wear their uniforms on the way to and from work amid concerns that Islamic extremists are plotting to target them on the streets, it has been reported. It comes as MI5 fears that extremists are planning an attack on an officer similar to that of Fusilier Lee Rigby, killed last year by two fanatics as he walked near his Woolwich barracks. Now seniors at Scotland Yard have warned officers to keep a low profile outside of work, issuing advice on what to wear when travelling to work and urging them to keep social media clean of all personal information. Police officers have been advised not to wear their uniforms on the way to and from work amid concerns that Islamic extremists are plotting to target them on the streets. Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Lee Rigby . It comes after police raised their internal threat level last month from 'moderate' to 'substantial' last month . A source told the Mirror: 'A raised threat level means officers have to be extra vigilant in everything they do. 'It means not travelling to work in full uniform and standing out unnecessarily out of work. 'Officers are also being warned about putting sensitive information about their personal lives on social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.' Fusilier Lee Rigby was killed in Woolwich after crossing the road near his barracks . Military commanders issued similar advice following the murder of Drummer Lee-Rigby in Woolwich in May last year. They later rescinded the advice that 'uniforms should be concealed while in a public place, particularly when travelling alone or from home to unit.' Drummer Rigby was not wearing his uniform when he was attacked, but a Help for Heroes hooded jumper. The Mirror reports that GCHQ has picked up talk of targeting a British police officer, and now MI5 are looking at intelligence that social media profiles of police officers are being monitored by jihadists. In October a gang was arrested accused of scouting Shepherd’s Bush police station and White City Territorial Army barracks in a ‘hostile reconnaissance’ mission using Google Street View. They were said to have kept Instagram images of two Scotland Yard police officers and two community support officers. The group is also charged with amassing jihadist material, including videos of beheadings. Security expert Neil Doyle told the paper: 'It makes perfect sense that terrorists would be using social media to scout for targets. 'The risk is that officers and PCSOs giving away precise details of their movements and routines may leave them open to being abducted by fanatics.' On Saturday it was revealed that internet service providers  did not raise the alarm about extreme messages posted by one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby in the six months before his death. The companies - who have come under intense pressure to do more to help police and the security services - failed to inform authorities about material posted by Michael Adebolajo before the attack he carried out with Michael Adebowale. It meant MI5 missed internet messages that could have alerted them to the threat posed by the murderers. A long-awaited report by Parliament’s intelligence watchdog is expected to say Adebolajo was posting extremist material on social media sites in the months leading up to the attack. The messages would have been sufficiently serious to justify the security services – who had had Adebolajo on their radar for eight years – putting him under more detailed surveillance. But officers found out about them only after the sickening murder of the 25-year-old soldier outside Woolwich Barracks in May last year. The report is expected to conclude that officials could not have prevented the attack on the day.","It is feared extremists are planning an attack on an officer similar to that of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich last year .

"Racist graffiti about a black pupil was daubed on the walls of his school hours after he died in an apparent suicide. The body of Erick Maina, who was praised as a role model and inspiration by teachers, was found at his home on Saturday morning. That night vile insults were sprayed on buildings at his school and in a nearby park. Erik Maina was a popular and well-respected pupil at Maricourt Catholic High School, which organised a vigil . The messages included a reference to the Ku Klux Klan, the word ‘n*****’ and Erick’s name alongside a swastika. Two teenagers were arrested and have pleaded guilty in court to racially aggravated criminal damage. Kenyan-born Erick, 15, complained of racial abuse at a gym last year and officers are investigating whether he had suffered any more in the run-up to his death. His mother, Jane, 45, told the Mail: ‘This is a very hard time for me. There are lots of questions running through our minds.’ Two teenagers have been arrested after racist graffiti was discovered at the school of Erik Maina, 15, who was found dead at his Merseyside home . Erick had posted ‘Bye’ on his Facebook account on the morning of his death. Brendan McLoughlin, the head of Erick’s school – Maricourt Catholic High in Maghull, Liverpool – said he was ‘sickened and shocked’ to find the graffiti on Sunday morning. Mr McLoughlin added: ‘After collaboration with the police, along with the site team, I removed the graffiti to ensure none of our pupils would have to witness such material.’ He said Erick was immensely popular, adding: ‘We’re all absolutely shocked about what’s happened. ‘It’s so tragic for a young boy who had such great prospects. He had a great future.’ The graffiti was found at Maricourt Catholic High School in Maghull where Erik was a pupil and at a park . Erik, who is originally from Nigeria, was found dead at his home after he posted the word 'Bye' on Facebook . It is understood that no allegations of bullying – racist or otherwise – were made by Erick at the school, where he was studying for his GCSEs. Yesterday, James Coleman, 18, of Netherton, and a 17-year-old youth from Bootle, who cannot be named, were remanded in custody after they admitted writing the graffiti. They will be sentenced at South Sefton Magistrates’ Court next month. Neither attends Maricourt High. Claire Hoban, 15, who was Erick’s prom date at the school, tweeted after his death: ‘We had plans to do loads, you’re still my prom date Erick.’ Joanne Gregory, a neighbour, expressed her disgust about the graffiti, writing on Facebook: ‘His lovely parents are going through enough, they do not need any more hurt such as this.’ The graffiti was found at Maricourt Catholic High School where Erik was a popular and respected pupil .

"Jasmine Johnston doesn't consider herself to be racist. The 33-year-old mother of four from Brisbane thinks it's unfair that her mother in law raises four children, and an Aboriginal woman who lives across the road with the same number of kids gets more in welfare payments. 'They're both in housing commissions, the only difference is my mother in law is white and they've got part Aboriginal in them,' she said. 'I feel like it's unfair, my mother in law was in the army when she had my husband and stuff, she's worked, so it's very hard it just seems like more things are given to [Aborigines].' Scroll down for video . From left: Sandy, Trent, Jasmine, host Ray Martin, Alice, Bo-dene and Marcus, from new series First Contact . Jasmine (left) and Bo-dene (right) were among six Australians who spent a month in Aboriginal communties . Jasmine is one of six Australians starring in new SBS documentary First Contact. Similar to the acclaimed Go Back To Where You Came From, the show takes six 'ordinary' Australians and immerses them in Aboriginal communities to try to challenge their prejudices about the Indigenous population. 'Petrol sniffing', 'wasters' and 'spending their dole cheques on booze' are among the labels the six people give to Aborigines at first. Host Ray Martin said none of the opinions he heard on the show shocked him, as he had heard them many times before. The veteran journalist and passionate advocate for Aboriginal issues said six out of 10 Australians have never met or have little to do with an Indigenous person. 'The Aboriginal problem is a festering sore of Australian society, it's one of those things we have to fix,' Mr Martin said. Jasmine says that months after filming she feels like some of her questions went unanswered, and she still believes it is unfair Aborigines get higher welfare payments and placements in university . The 33-year-old mother of four from Brisbane became distressed when watching a turtle be killed for food . 'So we thought we would take six people - average Aussies who weren't racists, or weirdos or nutters – and have people willing to ask questions and willing to question their beliefs. 'Why do they drink so much, why don't they send their kids to school, why don't they leave townships and get a job? They are all valid questions and not racist questions.' But while most participants have their strong opinions about Indigenous Australians changed over the course of the program, Jasmine says she is still 'up in the air'. She told Daily Mail Australia that months after filming, and before the first of three episodes begins airing on Tuesday night, she feels like some of her questions went unanswered. 'Definitely the whole welfare thing, you know the money, I feel like that wasn't properly answered,' she said. Over 28 days, the participants stayed with Aboriginal people all over the country . Bo-dene (centre, in dark green) feels like her views have been completely changed by the experience . 'And how they can automatically get a place in uni degrees. 'Obviously because I've got children too I feel like it affects me, they might be taking my children's place in uni.' Over 28 days, the participants stayed with Aboriginal people all over the country and were immersed in their way of life, from people living in Redfern in inner-city Sydney to remote communities only accessible by plane. Jasmine said this helped her reconsider some things - but not everything. 'I still don't fully understand the stolen generation, but I understand that Australia needed to say sorry. I was on the fence,' she said. 'I definitely believe some remote communities are disadvantaged to some degree. Host and veteran journalist Ray Martin hopes viewers will recognise themselves in the six participants, and similarly will question the way they think . 'The Aboriginal problem is a festering sore of Australian society,' Mr Martin said . Marcus (left) said Aborigines were disadvantaged while Sandy (right) said she thought they spent their dole cheques on alcohol . 'But definitely not the Aboriginal people that live close to major cities, they're not disadvantaged in any way.' Jasmine says she thinks she's ignorant but not racist – but she acknowledges that viewers will probably disagree. 'I'm not worried and I stand behind everything I said,' she said. 'The biggest myth is that Aboriginal people get a special deal, when comes to welfare and life. 'They do not get a special deal, we said to the guys ""You've seen the truth, hands up those who’d swap places with an Aboriginal"" and not one said yes. 'The special deals they get are health, education and housing that is woeful and shameful. 'The other one is that they get interest free cars and interest free housing, it's amazing how many people think that, and that's BS that just isn't true. 'I guess the other one is they're loafers and don’t want to help themselves. 'When people say why do Aboriginal kids get a special deal for education? That’s just good economics – it's dopey to keep paying this money for people who are on welfare or in jail because they don't have an education.' 'It's just because of ignorance - I didn't get taught anything about Aboriginal people at school.' She says her husband also shares her views, even though he possibly has Aboriginal heritage. 'He's very anti because of the name they've got, you know ""they're slackers they're dole bludgers"", they get interest free home loans and stuff,' she said. 'Just at the fact that they get handed everything - that's why he's worked all his life since 16 and he's worked for the house we've got.' Jasmine hopes to talk to the cast members and some of the Aboriginal people that featured on the show at a reunion party on Thursday to clear up some of her unanswered questions. Another cast member, Bo-dene Stieler, feels like her views have been completely changed by the experience. The 25-year-old, who works at a supermarket and lives in Coburg in Melbourne, cringes when she thinks about some of the things she said in front of the camera. 'I said Aboriginal people were wasters, I said they don't have jobs and that they get a lot of free stuff,' she said. 'Going into it I really needed to get my wisdom teeth out but I couldn't afford it, and if I was of Aboriginal descent I could have got it done. 'I guess it's hard… People wonder why there's a different way for Aboriginal people to get stuff.' Bo-dene said her most difficult moment came in the remote community of Elcho Island off the coast of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. 'The conditions were very confronting, it's almost third world being part of Australia and I never thought places like that existed here. Alice said she thought she identified with Aboriginal beliefs . The TV show airs over three night on SBS and starts on Tuesday November 18 . 'The first night was the most scariest night I've ever had in my life.' Bo-dene said she was being rude to their hosts because she felt threatened by the rubbish and wild dogs. 'I hope when people watch it they can appreciate that the place was really different to what I'm used to,' she said. 'I said things like ""Why is it so dirty, if you can afford to smoke you can afford to get cleaning products"".' The highlight was visiting Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia, where Aboriginal leader June Oscar has successfully campaigned for laws restricting the purchase of  alcohol in the town. Among its population, one-third of children suffer from foetal alcohol syndrome. Bodene, 25, who works at a supermarket and lives in Coburg in Melbourne, cringes when she thinks about some of the things she said in front of the camera . Law enforcement officer Trent (left) as one point said 'Aboriginal people keep using the past... move on' 'They started in their community a ban on alcohol, so it was really good, it was the first community that showed self-determination which was really impressive to see in my eyes,' Bo-dene said. 'A lot of places were in the mindset that they were waiting for outside help, it's a very tough cycle.' Bo-dene knows she is opening herself up to a lot of criticism by appearing on the show, but she chose to do it because she wanted her mind to be changed. 'Growing up I didn't have a lot of interaction with Aboriginal people, and I only ever see Aboriginal people come to the service desk at work to get money,' she said. 'I don't consider myself a racist - a lot of my closest friends are from India and China and stuff – and it annoyed me I had such a negative opinion of Aboriginal people. 'I really wanted my opinion to change, which is why I asked so many questions.' Mr Martin hopes viewers will recognise themselves in the six participants, and similarly will question the way they think. 'People who watch it hopefully will say that's what I think, that's my opinion too, which is not racist they simply don't know,' he said. First Contact begins airing 8.30pm Tuesday 18 November followed by episode 2 at 8.30pm on Wednesday 19 November, and concluding at 8.30pm on Thursday 20 November – broadcast simultaneously each night on SBS ONE and NITV, and replayed at 9.30pm on SBS 2 .","Six Australians in new documentary about attitudes to Aborigines .

"A routine jungle trek turned into tragedy when an elephant killed his handler and ran off with two tourists in south-west Thailand. Meaw the bull elephant is believed to have been in musth when he suddenly threw off his handler, trampled him to death, and disappeared into the jungle with a Russian woman and her nine-year-old daughter still on his back. Meaw was discovered nearly two miles away from the resort in Phang Nga, 310miles south of Bankok, and had to be tranquilized so the woman and her daughter could climb off. Scroll down for video . Angry bull: Meaw the elephant threw off his handler, trampled him to death, and disappeared into the jungle in Phang Nga, Thailand with a Russian woman and her nine-year-old daughter still on his back (stock image) The body of Suk Subbak, a 60-year-old elephant handler, was found a few hundred metres away. The jungle trek is a common activity offered to tourists visiting southern Thailand, and it is not yet known what brought on Meaw’s outburst. Meaw, and 18-year-old bull elephant, suddenly threw off Mr Subbak, trampled him, and ran off with the tourists during a standard trek on Sunday. Rescuers followed the elephant into the jungle and was able to locate him 30 minutes later. Another handler was able to jump onto Meaw’s neck by climbing up a nearby slope, but it still took several tranquilizer darts before the elephant was calm enough for the woman and her daughter to get off safely, Phuket Wan reports. It is thought that Meaw was in musth, a periodic change in bull behaviour related to an elated level in testosterone, which takes place in the winter months. Meaw was discovered nearly two miles away from the resort in Phang Nga, 310miles south of Bankok, and had to be tranquilized so the woman and her daughter could climb off . During this time even the most calm and peaceful bull becomes highly aggressive, and produces 40 to 60 times more testosterone than during non-musth. Although musth is caused by the male elephant's hormones, it is not connected to female elephants being in heat, and the reason for musth is a topic of debate among elephant experts. It is believed to be a way of marking territory, but it is also argued that musth is a way for weaker male elephants in a heard to mate with the females, rather than just the strongest bull, thus preventing inbreeding.","Bull threw off his handler and trampled him to death during trek .

"How many calories are in there? Research has revealed that the average Briton's lunch could harbour more calories and fat than the rest of your daily meals put together . With working hours mounting, lunch is often grabbed on the run in the middle of a hectic day. While your innocent sandwich may seem like a convenient option, experts claim that many seemingly nutritious lunchtime snack choices are laden with unhealthy ingredients. Research has revealed that the average Briton's lunch could harbour more calories and fat than the rest of their daily meals put together. In fact, some sandwiches contain as much salt as nine bags of crisps and are also high in fat and calories, found Which?. That said, we need between 400-600 calories for lunch to sustain us through a hectic working day so how do you fuel your day the healthy way? A raw food company says they have the answer as they are offering sandwiches packed with vegetables to revitalise lunchtimes. London-based company Raw Imagination, which was established after one of the founders cured their asthma via a raw food diet, has created healthy sandwich alternatives to classic favourites. Every £5.99 sandwich is dehydrated (mimicking sun drying) and takes over 30 hours to make. 'You can't rush nature,' said founder Alex Stanton. They decided to use coconut for bacon, walnuts and mushrooms for beef, sunflower seeds for chicken and cashew nuts for cheese and for the ""bread"" they use sunflower seed, flax, onion and olive oil bread. One of their most popular is a wholesome spin on the traditional British sandwich - a raw BLT. Instead of bread, they use nuts and seeds to create something akin to flaxseed and then cram it full of vegetables and smother it with coconut bacon - a mixture of coconut chips and smoked paprika. They also offer a sandwich filled with sunflower goujons and a falafel sandwich with Brazil nut hummus. Healthy alternative? Raw Imagination is a London company offering more virtuous sandwiches. Instead of bread, they use nuts and seeds to create something akin to flaxseed and then cram it full of vegetables . Instead of a beefburger, the duo offer a portobello mushroom coated in 'cheese' - a cashew sauce. Speaking to MailOnline, the Stanton brothers said: 'Loving sandwiches and living on this lifestyle we noticed a gap in the market where we could offer healthy alternatives to typical sandwiches and snacks. Our idea was to develop a range of ready-to-eat, on the go, raw, vegan, fresh and organic food. Nothing like this in the world seemed to exist. This is where the idea of Raw Imagination spawned from. 'We really wanted to start a RAWvolution. Our thinking behind the range was to turn ""junk food"" into health food, no easy task. We also wanted to make our food look like the traditional sandwiches that we all know but to ensure that they tasted even better. 'We went to work and spent hours on end trying to perfect our ideas and unique recipes. After much trial and error we managed to find the perfect blend of ingredients to create the sandwiches we currently sell today.' Raw Imagination is a family fun business run by two brothers, Alex and Oli Stanton, Nicole Nicolaou. Their mother does the admin, their father helps make the sandwiches, and their aunty is the delivery driver. Speaking about the future of the business, they said: 'We have been running for a little under a year and so far the business has trebled. We have lots of other healthy and exciting ideas that we are working on and some are already in development. Regarding the existing range, we are looking to spread the word far and wide. Ideally we would like to see our food in every health food store in London and eventually the UK.' Wholesome ingredients: Instead of a beefburger, the duo offer a portobello mushroom coated in 'cheese' - a cashew sauce - and healthy coleslaw . So are the raw snacks as good as they sound? Cassandra Barns, Nutritionist at NutriCentre.com, thinks so. She said: 'This is an excellent alternative to fast food or a standard sandwich. The ""bread"" is made from nuts, seeds and coconut, which provide healthy fats and more protein compared to standard bread, and more vitamins and minerals – especially when compared to white bread. 'This also means that it will have a lower glycaemic index than bread, so it has less of an effect on your blood sugar, and should fill you up for longer. It’s also great alternative for those who are avoiding gluten (or grains in general) because of a food intolerance. The filling includes lots of vegetables, again providing vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. 'And the vegan alternative to bacon sounds good too – the coconut will provide more fibre and healthier fats than bacon, but is just as filling. The one possible drawback is that all the nuts, seeds and coconut could be difficult to digest for some people, especially those who are not used to eating lots of raw food.' The healthy snacks may be welcome news after research revealed that 3.5m Brits haven’t eaten a vegetable in the last week. The ‘Vege-nation’ study  commissioned by Birds Eye revealed that over half the nation (53 per cent) eat two or fewer portions of vegetables each day, with nearly one in ten Brits (seven per cent) eating fewer veg now than they did as a child. One in seven (14 per cent) said that one reason they don’t eat enough vegetables is because they struggle to find exciting ways to prepare them while a quarter (27 per cent) avoid vegetables because they don't know how to cook them properly. Almost a quarter (23 per cent) said they avoid buying vegetables because they have such a short shelf life and go rotten too quickly. Meanwhile, more than one in ten Brits (11 per cent) are put off eating vegetables because of childhood traumas and bad memories of school dinners. Worryingly, four per cent of Brits believe that pasta and cornflakes make up one of your ‘five-a-day’ and a disillusioned two per cent admitted they thought cottage cheese and croissants constitute one of their ‘five a day’. Tipper Lewis, Head Herbalist at Neal's Yard Remedies, added: 'There has been such a notable movement towards consumers eating clean and taking responsibility for their health. Encouraging a healthy lifestyle is something we have always been very passionate about at Neal's Yard Remedies, we have always believed in educating our customers on ingredients so that they can make informed decisions on what to feed their bodies with. 'Superfood's are natures most nutritionally dense foods packed full of nutrients including vitamins, minerals and antioxidants and pack a supercharged boost of energy.'

"Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko today said he is ready for 'total war' with Russia . Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko today said he is ready for 'total war' against Russia as he claimed the crisis in eastern Europe is more serious than the threat from Islamic State. Kiev is convinced that Moscow is strengthening its troop presence on its borders and inside rebel-held areas, which the Kremlin has repeatedly denied. As Putin returned from the G20 in Brisbane where he was under siege from Western leaders, Poroshenko claimed his army is now better prepared to fight to defend its territory than when the conflict began. 'I am not afraid of a war with Russian troops,' he said. 'We are prepared for a scenario of total war. 'We don't want war, we want peace and we are fighting for European values.' He told Germany's Bild newspaper the unfolding drama on the edge of the EU was more critical than the Islamic State defiance. 'There are thousands of Russian soldiers, hundreds of tanks and heavy artillery in my country,' he insisted. 'This is one of the largest armies in the world, which threatens not only us, but also the whole of Europe.' He added: 'More than anything we want peace, but we must at the moment face up to the worst-case scenario.' The G20 had shown that Russia is 'completely isolated', he said, adding that Putin 'promises one thing and does the opposite the next day'. In the latest fighting six Ukrainian soldiers and three police officers were killed in the past 24 hours, said security officials in Kiev. Scroll down for video . President Petro Poroshenko, pictured yesterday during the Meeting of the V4 Presidents and Ukraine in Bratislava, Slovakia, said the crisis in his country was more serious than the threat of Islamic State . A spokesman for the pro-Ukrainian side in occupied Lugansk region today claimed that the latest 'humanitarian convoy' from Russia contained no food or winter clothing but only ammunition. 'People are coming to Stanitsa from the other side (in rebel held areas), via the bridge over Sevetny Donets River and they are saying the last humanitarian convoy brought just bullets and shells,' said Yaroslav Galas. 'They loaded boxes with bullets, mines and shells. No medicine, food or warm clothes there. Just bullets and shells - they unloaded them and left.' It was the latest convoy supposedly carrying food and winter clothing but the trucks were not open to Ukrainian or international inspection. The disturbing claim could not be verified. Despite his isolation at the G20, Putin was hailed for his diplomatic skills by the Russian media today. The pro-Kremlin Izvestia daily praised Putin for his early exit claiming he behaved with 'sang-froid.' As Putin, pictured, returned from the G20 in Brisbane where he was under siege from Western leaders, Poroshenko claimed his army is now better prepared . He was 'met badly, put in a terrible hotel, assailed from every side with numerous reproaches about our country's behaviour in southeastern Ukraine... and finally put right on the edge of the joint photograph.' Kommersant newspaper - owned by Arsenal FC shareholder Alisher Usmanov - claimed he 'managed to avoid the main thing: major scandals and continuing dialogue with its most implacable opponents.' Another prominent paper Vedomosti claimed that 'by leaving early, the Russian president avoided the need to react to the harsh statements of Western leaders at the end of the meeting' following his 'demonstratively cold reception'. Putin claimed today that the West overreacted to his annexation of Crimea, claiming it was no different 'from what was done in Kosovo', which the US and Europe supported. 'I am deeply convinced that Russia did not commit any violations of international law,' he said. 'In Crimea, people did not just make a parliamentary decision, they held a referendum, and its results were simply stunning.' Angela Merkel insisted that Putin would 'not prevail'.

"Two travel companies have apologised and offered hundreds of pounds in compensation to a pair of holidaymakers whose trip was cut short without warning. Michael Haye, 69, and his 63-year-old wife, June, said their holiday to the Spanish island of Majorca was ruined when it was shortened by four days. The Hayes, from Fareham, Hampshire, were furious when they arrived at their hotel, Sentido Punta del Mar, in Santa Ponsa, and were informed that their 11-day getaway was instead a seven-day trip. Michael and June Haye say their holiday was ruined when it was cut short by four days without notice . They booked the Thomas Cook holiday through a Thomson travel agent but both companies failed to inform them that the date of their return flight had changed. Mr Haye, who is retired, told the Portsmouth News: ‘Had we known earlier that it had been cut short, then we could have gone elsewhere. ‘It was the fact that they didn’t tell us that upset us. My wife was in tears.’ The Hayes were not satisfied with how their complaints were handled by the on-site hotel rep and the company’s customer service representatives, claiming no one initially took responsibility for the gaffe. Upset: Michael Haye says his wife, June, 'was in tears' after learning they would be going home early . Thomas Cook agreed to reimburse the couple £248 for the hotel and give them £400 in compensation, the Portsmouth News reported. Thomson offered an additional £170 in compensation. After receiving compensation eight weeks after the September trip, Mr Haye said: ‘This is not a trumpet-blowing exercise. Well, perhaps a little, but we feel we’ve won a battle for the little man.’ In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, a Thomas Cook spokesperson said a change to its flight programme saw the couple’s holiday curtailed to seven nights. Thousands of tourists sun themselves at the popular beach holiday resort of Santa Ponsa . The spokesman said: ‘The few customers affected by this change should have been advised of this in advance of travel either directly by ourselves or through our travel agency partners, with all refunded the difference in price. ‘Although our records show that our colleagues in the Thomson store were advised, Mr and Mrs Haye were unfortunately not informed prior to their departure. ‘We would like to assure the Haye family, and indeed all our customers, that we are collaborating with our partners to establish the reasons behind this miscommunication, with a view to ensuring that this remains an isolated incident.’ Thomas Cook and Thomson say the mistake occurred after the Hayes' return flight changes . Thomson said its staff were not told of the change to the couple’s flights. A spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: ‘Thomson acted solely as a third-party booking agent on this occasion and the change in duration of the holiday was out of our control. ‘Unfortunately, whilst an update was received by the reservation system, no alert or communication was sent to advise our staff of the change. In the absence of any notification and as no updated tickets were provided to us, our staff did not have any details to advise the customer of.’","Michael and June Haye learned of the gaffe from employees at their hotel .

"Statins can reduce erectile dysfunction by up to 25 per cent . Statins are known for lowering cholesterol but they could also improve your love life, according to a new study. American researchers have found the commonly used drugs may benefit men with erectile dysfunction. They now hope their findings will encourage men with high cholesterol to take their medication. Erectile dysfunction is common in older men, especially among those with heart problems, for which cholesterol-lowering statins are frequently prescribed. Previous research has suggested that taking statins can negatively affect testosterone levels. This has led to questions about the effects of the widely used medication on the quality of erections. In the first analysis of previous studies on erectile dysfunction and statins, researchers identified 11 trials that measured erectile function using the International Index of Erectile Function. The IIEF is a self-administered survey with five questions, each scored on a five-point scale and totalled, with lower values representing poorer sexual function. Analysis of all 11 studies combined found a statistically significant effect of statins on erectile function in men who had both high cholesterol and erectile dysfunction. Overall, erectile function scores rose by 3.4 points in men who took statins - from 14.0 to 17.4. This represents a 24.3 per cent improvement. 'The increase in erectile function scores with statins was approximately one-third to one-half of what has been reported with drugs like Viagra, Cialis or Levitra,' said study lead investigator Dr John Kostis, director of the Cardiovascular Institute and associate dean for Cardiovascular Research at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. ‘It was larger than the reported effect of lifestyle modification. For men with erectile dysfunction who need statins to control cholesterol, this may be an extra benefit.’ He believes that statins may work to . improve erectile function by helping blood vessels dilate properly and . improving vascular blood flow to the penis, which is often restricted in . men with erectile dysfunction. Statins are commonly prescribed for high cholesterol and doctors hope the latest findings will give men a greater incentive to take the pills . He added that while statins are not recommended as a primary treatment for erectile dysfunction in patients with healthy cholesterol levels, the added benefit may encourage more men who need statins to take them. Dr Kostis added: ‘Rather than preventing the possibility of a heart attack in the future, the more immediate benefit of improving erectile function might improve adherence to statin therapy.’ Erectile dysfunction affects millions of men and occurs more often in those over the age of 40. Common causes include heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, tobacco use, depression and stress. Dr Kostis said that larger trials are needed to further investigate the link between statin therapy and erectile function. The study was published online by the Journal of Sexual Medicine.","Statins can reduce the problems of erectile dysfunction by up to 25% .

"Two wealthy couples have spent £500,000 on a venomous legal battle over ‘a few feet’ of muddy ditch between their homes, shocked Appeal Court judges heard yesterday. The couples have lavished six- figure sums on the dispute about a drainage ditch running alongside a bridle path between their properties in Cheshire. Businessman Richard Gilks and his wife Heidi insist they have a right to drive over the ditch and down the track next to their five-acre property in Mobberley, as a shortcut to Wilmslow – home to Sir Alex Ferguson and a host of other celebrities. Land battle: Neighbours have spent £500,000 in a dispute over a 'few feet' of ditch. The Gilks from Fiveacres (right) wants to drive over it along a track, in red, but the Hodgsons, from White Peak Farm (left), say they are 'breaking the law' Their neighbours, Adrian Hodgson, 75, and his wife Joanne, 63 – who breed alpacas and wallabies – say the Gilkses are breaking the law and that their animals are disturbed by traffic passing along the track. The Hodgsons are asking London’s Appeal Court to rule that the Gilkses do not own the whole ditch, and have no legal right to drive over it. Lord Justice Bean said: ‘This case is about a patch of land a few feet either way. What are the costs in the case so far? Half a million? I imagine that the disputed right of way is worth rather less.’ The area surrounding Mobberley and Wilmslow is home to footballing royalty, including Wayne Rooney, Louis van Gaal and Joe Hart. Unhappy: Richard Gilks won a ruling in their favour last year but his rival Adrian Hodgson, right, says their cars disturb the animals they breed on their land . Lord Justice Bean, Lord Justice Christopher Clarke and Sir Stanley Burnton heard that the Gilkses’ property and the Hodgsons’ home were originally part of one parcel of land, which was divided and sold off in 1950. The Hodgsons’ land has been in their family for years, while the Gilkses moved in in 2004, said Caroline Hutton, for Mr and Mrs Hodgson. After getting on initially, the couples fell out over a planning dispute and then went to war over the ditch and the track. Wrangle: The Gilks use this track as a way to get to nearby Wilmslow, which makes their neighbours furious . Miss Hutton said the Hodgsons saw red when Mr and Mrs Gilks began using the bridle path – beside which they grazed their alpacas – as a means of cutting a few minutes off their drive into Wilmslow. Years of bitter feuding in and outside court ensued, with the Gilkses insisting they were exercising a legitimate right of way and the Hodgsons claiming their neighbours were breaking the law. The Gilkses scored a victory at Manchester County Court in December last year, when the judge ruled that they own the whole ditch and that their boundary lies in the middle of the track, giving them the right to drive over the ditch. But the Hodgsons are challenging that decision, saying their neighbours’ boundary reaches only halfway across the ditch, and they are legally blocked from crossing the other half in a vehicle. Miss Hutton told the judges yesterday that land registry plans prove the border of the Gilkses’ home extends no further than the centre of the ditch. Bitter: Heidi Gilks, left, and her husband Richard are battling neighbours Joanne Hodgson, right, and her husband Adrian over the right of way row . Ian Foster, for Mrs and Mrs Gilks, said that even if the couple did not own the whole ditch, they had established a legitimate vehicular right of way through long usage. ‘Mr and Mrs Gilks have always maintained that a right of way through the gate and over and along the track was necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of [their home] because of the size of the property and its particular geographic location,’ he added. Lord Justice Clarke, expressing bafflement over the protracted war over a ditch, asked the lawyers: ‘What is so special about it?’ Mr Foster said: ‘Using the way for the purpose of travelling to and from the closest town of Wilmslow gave rise to a significantly shorter journey than would have been the case had that same journey been made using the public highway.’ The judges have reserved their decision until a later date. Confusion: Judges at the Court of Appeal in London expressed their shock that both parties have spent £500,000 in a legal battle over a ditch .","Neighbours have been rowing for years over who owns 'thin strip' of land .
The Gilks family believe they have right to drive over it along a track .

"It is the 'Jewel of Japan', but Kanazawa, one of the top destinations for Japanese tourists, is barely known outside the country. Tucked between the Sea of Japan and the Japan Alps, peaks etched on the horizon like a backdrop to a stage, Kanazawa is rather off the beaten track. That could all change when the shinkansen, Japan's famous bullet train, arrives next year at an appropriately gleaming station, rebuilt in 2005 under a dome of glassand-steel fretwork and fronted by a wooden gate shaped like a drum, with a digital clock marked out in tiny bubbling fountains. It is a tourist attraction in its own right. A bridge into Japan's beautiful past: Kanazawa is filled with places that exude a sense of the old Japan . Often likened to Kyoto, Japan's former capital, for its wealth of old buildings (escaping earthquakes and war damage alike - though not always the careless redevelopment of post-war years), Kanazawa was once the fourth-biggest city and flourished in feudal times. For nearly 300 years the town was under the control of one clan, the Maeda family and, in places, you can still imagine being back a couple of centuries. For example, the Higashi Pleasure District is the only place outside Kyoto with geishas. The traditional architecture - low roofs of glistening curved black tiles, finely latticed frontages (easy to see out, but not in) - is unchanged. Geishas in elaborate kimonos and ghost-white faces can be seen, or heard practising their songs and instruments: the drum or the three-stringed shamisen. At the shop where the Fukushima family has made shamisen for 130 years, visitors are allowed to practise too. In response to our summons by xylophone (serving as a bell), we were led upstairs for the obligatory green tea, before being let loose on the shamisen with instructions on how to play Sakura, Sakura (Cherry Blossom, Cherry Blossom), a simple folk song. The Samurai (warrior) district of Nagamachi is likewise perfectly preserved. Fashions and flavours of the Far East: Geishas in Kanazawa (left); crabs, as sold at Ohmicho market (right) Paved lanes, surprisingly free of the usual spaghetti tangle of overhead cables, wind between ochre mud walls (the higher the wall, the higher the status). By the 400-year-old canal is the Nomura family house, deludingly calm for the residence of a warrior, with its uncluttered interiors, tatami straw mats, sliding paper doors and meditatively peaceful garden with the inevitable carp swimming in gently trickling waters. On display is a scroll - a thankyou letter, dated October 9, 1566, to Nomura for killing a high-ranking soldier. 'We are very happy that you brought us his head,' it says. Across the iron bridge (identified as a 'registered national tangible cultural property') spanning one of Kanazawa's two rivers is Teramachi ('temple town'), a quiet enclave of temples and shrines, and gatherings of statues with red bibs, memorials to children. But the biggest tourist attraction is Kenrokuen, once part of the 18th Century castle (some of which still remains), and now one of the top three gardens of Japan. Visiting is not a peaceful experience, as large groups are led around by megaphone-wielding guides, and a photographer on a stepladder takes pictures of neatly grouped tourists. Rather more tranquil is the smaller family-owned Gyokusenen Garden, where there are moss-covered stone lanterns, winding paths under trees, streams and waterfalls. This was the perfect setting to learn about the tea ceremony, explained gravely by Mrs Nishida in the tea house. Taking time, keeping in step with the past: A traditional Japanese tea ceremony . Japan's tea ceremony involves confectionery, and that is entirely appropriate in Kanazawa, which is renowned for its sweets. In Higashi, we'd come across Morihachi, a sweet shop since 1625. Kanazawa also has a reputation for more wholesome fare, especially seafood. The stalls at Ohmicho market are laden with baby aubergines, long-stalked slender mushrooms and huge melons, but mainly tuna, crabs, squid, oysters - and eels. Eel Day was coming up (the nutrients are supposed to help you survive the heat of the summer), and long queues were kept in check by cordons. We lunched there, at Conveyor Belt Sushi where saucers of salmon, prawn, tuna and pickled plums were ferried along the counter to us. Each place setting had pots containing soy sauce, slivers of ginger, green tea powder (next to individual taps for boiling water). It was an easier meal - though not so lavish - than the feast we had another day at a traditional restaurant, sitting for an hour on our folded knees on the floor. At the other extreme, we were taken by a resident into a basement, past the customary models of different dishes (how else would we know what to eat?) to booths supplied with a computer tablet for ordering our food, which arrived promptly and without ceremony. When the message 'We are close time at soon' flashed up, we consulted the tablet (no need to call for the bill), paid up and left. By this time we'd moved from the Kanazawa Grand Hotel, which more or less lived up to its name (women bowing to residents as they entered the lifts), to Ryokan Murataya, with its rows of slippers at the door and ofuro (communal bath), and a larger 'eight-tatami room' with futons. It was an oasis of tranquillity, though situated - in something of a culture clash - just one block from a shopping street where the stores included Zara and Subway. A version of Japan undamaged by war or modernity: Parts of Kanazawa have a visibly historic feel . The juxtaposition made Kanazawa's Unesco-designated Craft City status seem rather surreal, though Kutani porcelain and lacquer work have been made here since Maeda days. One pottery we found had exquisite little bowls costing several thousand yen. Visitors are encouraged to participate in the local crafts, and the tourist office has sessions for making tiny dolls from cloth and tote bags from newspaper. I learned how to decorate chopsticks using gossamer-thin squares of gold leaf. Nearly all gold leaf used in Japan comes from Kanazawa. In one shop - offering gold-leaf body lotion and gold and silver golf balls - we were given cups of tea containing flecks of gold. It's good for health and vitality, apparently. Upstairs were toilets tiled in gold ('Feel free to use,' said the video at the foot of the stairs) and a gallery full of the sort of thing a Bond villain might have in his home, like gold horses and dragons. Amid all the tradition, the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art (opened in 2004) comes as a great surprise. Just across the road from the sculptured landscapes of Kenrokuen is a low circular glass and white building set in green lawns with installations by international artists like Olafur Eliasson. The glass walls encircling the galleries provide insight into the free public spaces that include a library, playroom and cafe with gleaming white banquettes. There is no front or back to the museum, and with four entrances it encourages approach from all sides (no doubt a cultural statement as well as an architectural attraction). It's a bold and brilliant attempt to assert Kanazawa as a modern town of culture as well as a venerated historic one. And it works splendidly.

"Teenage twin sisters have been split up and forced to go to different schools after previously spending every day together. Paris and Paige Carrington-Windo, 14, say they left secondary school, Miltoncross Academy in Portsmouth, Hampshire, for a new one when their family was due to move home. However, when the house move fell through, only Paige was given her place back, while Paris must walk 30 minutes to go to Priory School, Portsmouth, a mile-and-a-half from where her sister studies. Twin sisters: Paris (left) and Paige Carrington-Windo, 14, have been split up and forced to go to different schools after previously spending every day together . The girls and their mother, Samantha Carrington-Windo, 35, have been left upset and frustrated by the school’s decision to only allow one of them back. ''I’m not happy at all. It’s really got the whole family down,' said Mrs Carrington-Windo, who lives with her daughters in Portsmouth. 'I’m a single parent and my two daughters have been together since birth. They are twins and they should go to the same school. 'I feel they should be leaving for school together and coming home together. 'It’s frustrating because every parent wants their child to do well and now Paris isn’t. Changing plans: Paige (left) and Paris had left  Miltoncross Academy in Portsmouth, Hampshire, for a new one when their family was due to move, but when this fell through, only Paige was given her place back . Distance: While Paige is back at Miltoncross Academy, Paris is still at Priory School, a mile-and-a-half away . Lessons: Both girls had initially attended Miltoncross Academy, but now only Paige is a pupil . New school: Paris now goes to Priory School, which her mother says takes half an hour to reach . 'It takes her half an hour just to get to school - I bought her a bike to help but someone damaged it.' Miltoncross headteacher Fiona Calderbank said Mrs Carrington-Windo had hoped to move both her daughters following a disagreement over the school’s policies. She said: 'Mrs Carrington-Windo informed us she was moving her children to another school. 'She was not happy with many of the school rules and policies when they were applied to her daughter Paris. 'As the school rules and policies have not changed and Paris is progressing well in her new school, it would not make educational sense for her to move again. 'Disagreement': Miltoncross headteacher said the girls' mother had disagreed with her over school policies regarding Paris (right), and it made 'educational sense' for the teenager to stay at her new school . 'We had no cause or reason to contact mum regarding application of school rules and policies with respect of her other daughter. 'It would not have been fair not to accept her.' Mrs Carrington-Windo maintained she had only wanted  the girls to change schools because of her planned house move, and that although she had complained to Miltoncross in the past over issues including Paris being told to wear leather shoes, this was not why she wanted the girls to leave. She said if she had disagreed with the school, she would not have wanted both girls to return. Mrs Carrington-Windo said: 'I didn’t like the school policies but that’s not why my daughter left the school. The house move fell through.' Paris said: 'I can’t really concentrate in my lessons. I’m always with Paige and I don’t like being apart. I don’t want to be going to school.” Paige added: 'It’s not the same any more because I am always with Paris. She was always there if I need help or anything.'","Paris and Paige Carrington-Windo left Miltoncross Academy, Portsmouth .

"A dying two-year-old's last Christmas wish has come true as her community worked together to transform her house into a winter wonderland. Calianna Griggs's family wanted to stage an early Christmas for the toddler, who may not make it to December. She was diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome and adrenocortical carcinoma in April and despite chemotherapy and multiple surgeries, doctors say she has just a month to live. But on Thursday, thanks to dozens of volunteers and donations from the community - Cali got her dying wish. Cali Griggs, two, got her Christmas wish as volunteers transformed her house into a wonderland . Gifts: Santa, elves and even Minnie Mouse was on hand to ensure Cali's final Christmas is special . She and her parents were picked up by Santa Claus in a horse-drawn carriage down the street from their home. When it came around the corner, she saw her home transformed. Part of the wonderland featured a tent with Minnie Mouse, Cali's favourite character, and gifts for the toddler. Her father Greg Griggs told AZ Central: 'She just wanted to get out and play with everything. 'And I had to fight it, I was about to cry.' Volunteers filled the yard with decorations and blanketed the house with lights - which will stay up for the entire holiday season. The local fire department and J Barry Designs spent house making snow that covered the lawn - and despite it taking all day, it was worth it when Cali enjoyed a snowball fight with her father. Magical: Volunteers worked all day to put up lights and decorations to fulfil the two-year-old's dying wish . A horse-drawn carriage drove Cali and her parents to meet Minnie Mouse, Cali's favourite character . Hugs: The transformation was possible after thousands of dollars were raised in donations . A couple of weeks ago, Cali's family said her doctor gave her one to three months to live and desperate for her not to miss Christmas, they said they planned to stage it early. The genetic syndrome she has, which affects fewer than 500 people in the world, has created the rare cancer and given her more than 30 tumors on her lungs, one on her adrenal gland, another in her belly and one on her spine. Despite undergoing intense chemotherapy twice and multiple surgeries, doctors at the hospital in West Valley, Arizona, have told her parents, childhood sweethearts Greg and Ashley Gonzalez, that she has between one and three months left. 'Calianna is our precious little angel, she is so sweet and deserves a chance to be with us a little longer,' her mother said. Tragic: Calianna Griggs, aged two, has been given one month to live after contracting adrenal gland cancer . Last wish: Her parents Greg Griggs and Ashley Gonzalez hope to make her last Christmas the most special . Diagnosed: This is Cali in the early stage of her cancer last spring went she grew three dress sizes in 10 days . But Mr Griggs added that it is unlikely she will live out the full three months: 'We want her last Christmas to be the best and we also want for her funeral service to be very special.' Mr Griggswas tearful as he told MailOnline: 'She is in a world of pain that I couldn't even imagine. 'It is just getting harder and harder and harder.' The couple noticed something was wrong when Cali ballooned from aged two clothes to aged five clothes in just 10 days. She is now continuing to swell up and is becoming increasingly lethargic. In a recent local TV interview, Mr Griggs broke down in tears as he could hear the microphone picking up Cali struggling to breathe. 'It was just too much. She finds it so difficult. Sometimes now she just sleeps for hours at a time.' Fun: Cali loves dressing up but she is finding it harder to breathe and play as her cancer gets worse . Her mother updated family and friends on their GoFundMe page: 'She is so swollen now and her tummy is as hard as a rock. But the saddest part is she is struggling to breathe now. 'I am scared to fall asleep every night because I'm afraid she will stop breathing in the middle of the night.' Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a disorder that affects a handful of people worldwide. It stems from mutations of either the TP53 gene or CHEK2 gene, which normally act as tumor suppressors by controlling the growth and division of cells. When mutated, it allows cells to multiply, grow and divide in and out-of-control nature, making sufferers more susceptible to cancer, especially leukaemia, brain and breast cancer. In many cases, one of the sufferer's relatives will have had a cancer that displays similar characteristics. Cali's LFS prompted adrenocortical carcinoma, a rare cancer that forms in the outer layer of tissue of the adrenal gland. The gland is a small organ on top of each kidney that makes steroid hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline to control heart rate, blood pressure and other body functions. The disease, which affects up to just two million people a year, has a five-year survival rate of 20-35 per cent. Symptoms include hair growth, weight gain, a lump in the stomach or back of the head, muscle weakness and high blood pressure. Fundraising: They have set up a GoFundMe site to prepare for the funeral and the family's early Christmas .","Calianna Griggs was diagnosed with adrenal gland cancer last spring .

"Maine officials are trying to turn the tables by hunting down some  poachers who've killed four moose since November 3 and simply left their corpses to rot. The incidents in Aroostook in northernmost Maine occurred during the annual moose hunt, however hunters of the massive animals require permits issued annually in a statewide lottery and all killed moose must be tagged and weighed. Maine Warden Service officials in late October offered a $2,500 reward for help nabbing a shooter in the west-central part of the state in a separate incident. Poachers: Maine officials have appealed to the public for help tracking down poachers who've killed four moose in the state's northernmost reaches this month . Waste: Officials don't think the incidents are related. However, all the animals were left to waste away in the snow . In the first incident, where a small bull moose was killed and abandoned, Corporal John MacDonald reported: . 'A male and a female are believed to be involved and they were operating a red regular-cab GMC or Chevy pickup with an eight-foot bed.' Officials don't think the incidents are related. In the second incident, reported November 4, the moose was also believed to have been shot on November 3. The third moose, officials believe, was shot the following day. Soon a fourth moose was discovered in the same county. All were left to waste away in the snow. 'We are working on all four [cases] diligently and we are hopeful someone heard or saw something suspicious in those areas during the [week of moose hunting],' Sergeant Dan Menard wrote in a release sent to the Bangor Daily News. 'All moose were shot and left during the third week of the moose hunt.' On October 28, state game officials announced Operation Game Thief and offered a $2,500 reward for help finding the poacher who shot and killed a cow moose in a more southern part of the state. That moose was also left to waste, the Bangor Daily News reported. Other instances: On October 28, state game officials announced Operation Game Thief and offered a $2,500 reward for help finding the poacher who shot and killed a cow moose in a more southern part of the state. Ticks infestations are blamed, in part, for a decline in the size of Vermont's moose herd, now estimated to be 2,500 — below the optimum number of between 3,000 and 5,000. Similar reductions have been noted in New Hampshire and Maine. Ticks can cause moose to loose blood and to scratch off their fur, making it harder to withstand cold weather. Officials in Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire issued fewer moose hunting permits this fall, citing the impact of winter ticks on their moose populations. In Minnesota, where ticks are among several factors that have cut the population by more than half in less than a decade, there was no moose hunting season at all.","***WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT*** Four poached moose have been found in Aroostook County in northernmost Maine since November 3 .

"Couple: Andrew Mitchell arriving at the High Court yesterday with his wife Sharon Bennett . Sir Bob Geldof called the Tory MP at the centre of the Plebgate saga 'no slouch' when it comes to swearing, a libel trial heard yesterday. Andrew Mitchell - whom the High Court heard is a ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ figure who has repeatedly demeaned police throughout his career - has admitted using a ‘mixture of charm and menace’ to keep MPs in line in his role as Chief Whip. The MP is suing News Group Newspapers over the allegation that, after being refused entry through a Downing Street gate on his bike, he told officers: ‘Best you learn your f****** place ... you don’t run this f****** government, you’re f****** plebs.’ The court heard claims that Mr Mitchell had also made a habit of issuing profane and demeaning comments at police and security staff. The court was also told that Sir Bob Geldof, who worked closely with Mr Mitchell when he was International Development Secretary, had provided a statement testifying to the MP’s use of profanity, while Tory peer Lord Coe agreed that his language was ‘fruity’. The former Cabinet minister allegedly told a security guard at the Palace of Westminster to ‘stop being so aggressive, you little s***’ when he was reprimanded for cycling through Black Rod’s Gate in 2005. He is said to have added: ‘I’m an MP and I’m too important to stop for you.’ Mr Mitchell was also asked about an incident in Tunisia in 2011, when a member of his police protection team told him he could not cross into Libya. The MP reportedly told him: ‘That’s a bit above your pay grade, Mr Plod.’ The incidents were outlined on the first day of the latest legal proceedings relating to Plebgate. Scroll down for video . Evidence: The court was told that Sir Bob Geldof (left) had provided a statement testifying to the MP’s use of profanity, while Tory peer Lord Coe (right) agreed that his language was 'fruity' Mr Mitchell denies calling officers 'f****** plebs', although he admits saying ‘I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us’ after officers refused to open the gate. News Group Newspapers argues that its article in The Sun was substantially true. Toby Rowland, the police officer that Mr Mitchell reportedly called a ‘pleb’, is suing the MP for suggesting he made up the allegations. The 58-year-old MP was forced to resign a month after the controversy erupted in 2012, following an ‘extraordinary tsunami of vitriol’. Apologised for swearing: Mr Mitchell (file picture from May 2011) says that he asked politely to use the main gates and muttered under his breath 'I thought you guys were supposed to f***ing help us' James Price, QC, acting for the MP, told the court the allegations against his client were a ‘web of lies’ and accused the police of ‘deceit and indiscipline’. PC Toby Rowland is suing the MP for suggesting he made up the allegations . However, Desmond Browne QC, for Mr Rowland, said many officers had seen ‘Mr Hyde and not Mr Jekyll’. ‘Doubtless he is charming to the officers in his constituency station at Sutton Coldfield when he goes to visit them at Christmas,’ he said, before warning that police in Downing Street ‘have seen the other side of his character – his capacity for menace’. The court were told that the MP shouted ‘chop chop’ to one officer while they opened Downing Street gates on a separate occasion. He was also said to have launched a ‘foul-mouthed tirade’ at his protection detail when a journey was delayed at the last minute. On the night before the Plebgate incident, he is said to have told Downing Street police: ‘I am the Government Chief Whip and I want to be allowed through the vehicle gate.’ Mr Mitchell said he could not recall any of these outbursts. Giving evidence under oath yesterday, Mr Mitchell denied ever calling a police officer a pleb. During a testy cross-examination, the MP said: ‘I do not deny I have a temper sometimes, but I do deny I am quick to lose it. ‘I am capable of using bad language, I use it too much. I also admit that I can sometimes be impatient and short-tempered when I consider I am being prevented from going about my legitimate business. 'I even admit that I can be, or at least that I can appear to be, rude on these occasions. 'To the best of my recollection, I have never called anybody a pleb, let alone a policeman. ‘Since the incident I have thought long and hard about this and cannot recall a single instance when I have called anybody a pleb. It just isn’t a word I use.’ Hearing: The High Court (pictured) in central London was told that there was a 'web of lies, deceit and indiscipline' by police officers . He added: ‘From a political angle, it was the word pleb that was dynamite. I was horrified at this wholly untrue allegation.’ Mr Price said Mr Mitchell was ‘a good man’, adding: ‘In the end the lies brought Mr Mitchell down, destroying a political career of 27 years.’ The Plebgate saga has led to the conviction of one officer for misconduct in public office and the dismissal of three others. Mr Price said the Police Federation, funded mainly by police officer subscriptions - which is supporting Mr Rowland - has already spent £1million  in legal costs. The case continues.

"Iran's hopes of progressing to the last 16 of this summer's World Cup were ended by a Bosnia side who had already been eliminated. Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko put Safet Susic's side into the lead as his drilled effort in the 22nd minute went in via the post. Bosnia doubled their lead through Roma playmaker Miralem Pjanic who stroked the ball into the back of the net just before the hour mark. Reza Ghoochannejhad pulled a goal back for Carlos Queiroz's side with ten minutes to go but any hopes of an incredible comeback were soon dashed as right-back Avdija Vrsajevic extended Bosnia's lead almost instantly. Click here to read the full match report . Click here for Sportsmail's brilliant World Cup Match Zone . Bosnia: Begovic, Vrsajevic, Sunjic, Spahic, Kolasinac, Hadzic, Pjanic, Besic, Susic, Dzeko, Ibisevic. Iran: Alireza Haghighi, Hosseini, Sadeghi, Montazeri, Pouladi, Teymourian, Nekounam, Dejagah, Shojaei, Hajsafi, Ghoochannejhad. Host commentator . So a Bosnia victory sees Nigeria progress to the last 16 with Group F winners Argentina. Iran battled hard but you can't really expect to go though with just a single goal in three matches. Both managers, Iran's Carlos Quieroz and Bosnia's Safet Susic, are expected to step down following their side's elimination. Sportsmail will keep you updated with any developments. Thanks for joining us. Iran frontman Karim is booked having gone down rather easily in the box. The referee is wise to it and produces the yellow card. Edin Dzeko's World Cup is over as he is replaced by Edin Visca. That's surely game over as Bosnia go up the end of the field to score. Right-back Vrsajevic makes up for his earlier miss by extending his side's lead with eight minutes to go. Iran launch a cross along the six-yard box and Ghoochannejhad is on hand to tap home. Is this the start of an incredible comeback? I doubt it. ...but the Charlton frontman's powerful left-foot effort is well blocked by the Bosnia defence . Tino Sven Susic makes way for Sejad Salihovic . Besic is booked for a late challenge on Heydari. Iran need three goals in the final fifteen minutes to keep their World Cup hopes alive. Unfortunately a Bosnia goal looks more likely. Karim Ansari Fard replaces Ashkan Dejagah. The Fulham midfielder has worked hard this evening. Wideman Alireza Jahanbakhsh comes on for defender Ehsan Haji Safi. Midfielder Anel Hadzic is replaced by defender Ognjen Vranjes. Huge setback for Iran as Bosnia double their lead. Roma midfielder Miralem Pjanic latches on to Dzeko' through ball and coolly places the ball home. Very impressive finish. Very much 'what could have been' for the Bosnians. A more than capable side. Ten minutes in to the second half and it's all Iran so far. Ashkan Dejagah goes close but skews his effort as the linesman calls for offside to spare the blushes of the Fulham man. Defender Marcos Rojo heads Argentina back into the lead to give Iran hope. Click the above link to keep up-to-date with Nigeria's game. Ahmed Musa scores his second of the evening to draw Nigeria level. As it stands, an Iranian victory would still not be enough to see Carlos Quieroz's side through. Iran have never beaten a European side at the World Cup. However, they have scored SIXTEEN goals in five matches against Bosnia. Khosro Heydari comes on Masoud Shojaei at the start of the second half. Iran still have a chance of going through. However, they MUST beat Bosnia so need two goals. No problem for a side who are yet to score so far at this World Cup. With nothing to play for, Bosnia lead Iran courtesy of Dzeko's strike after 22 minutes. You guessed it... Messi scores for Argentina. The Barcelona star scores a sublime free-kick to put his team back in front. Click the above link for updates from the game. Right-back Avdija Vrsajevic drags the ball wide with a shot when he could have easily played the ball across the six-yard box and into the path of Dzeko. Bosnia's decision-making, particularly in the final third, have cost them this tournament. The Bosnia captain has seemingly shaken off that knock and has returned to the field almost instantly. FUN FACT: Spahic is the first cousin of international team-mate Edin Dzeko. Spahic has been taken off on a stretcher for the time-being. We'll see if he is able to return to the action but it must be said he did look like he was in some considerable pain. As mentioned previously, should Bosnia have started with two up-front for the majority of this tournament? Iran almost respond immediately as Shojaei rifles a shot against the crossbar. Asmir Begovic stood no chance! The goal-line technology replays are shown but there was no need - never over the line. That's been coming! Edin Dzeko drills the ball home from distance and it cannons in off the post. 1-0. Perfect precision from the striker. The three previous games played in Salvador during this World Cup have produced 17 goals. Alas, I fear the city’s free-scoring reputation may take a nosedive this afternoon. Masoud Shojaei took a powerful Miralem Pjanic free-kick to the chest and was clearly in agony as he rolled around on the floor. Luckily the Las Palmas midfielder is back on his feet and able to continue. Dzeko has made a lively start to this game but his header is easily saved. So, there'll be no drawing of lots - Ahmed Musa equalises for the Super Eagles after just four minutes. Click the above link to keep up-to-date with this evening's other Group F clash. The Man City frontman lashed a shot on target but Haghighi in the Iran goal did well to get good hand on the ball to tip it over. Lionel Messi fires Argentina ahead after two minutes. Nigeria 0-1 Argentina. Remember, if Iran win 1-0 and Nigeria lose by the scoreline both sides will have identical Group F records. If this happens, FIFA will draw lots in the Maracana 90 minutes after the final whistle to decide which team progresses. Carlos Quieroz was known as a hard taskmaster at Manchester United, introducing regular double-training sessions when he was Sir Alex Ferguson’s No2. So perhaps we shouldn't be surprised Iran are extremely well-drilled in this World Cup. Bosnia: Begovic, Vrsajevic, Sunjic, Spahic, Kolasinac, Hadzic, Pjanic, Besic, Susic, Dzeko, Ibisevic. Subs: Fejzic, Bicakcic, Vranjes, Misimovic, Mujdza, Lulic, Ibricic, Medunjanin, Visca, Hajrovic, Salihovic, Avdukic. Iran: Alireza Haghighi, Hosseini, Sadeghi, Montazeri, Pouladi, Teymourian, Nekounam, Dejagah, Shojaei, Hajsafi, Ghoochannejhad. Subs: Ahmadi, Heydari, Reza Haghighi, Jahanbakhsh, Ansarifard, Hadadifar, Mahini, Alnameh, Rahmani, Beikzadeh, Beitashour,Davari. Referee: Carlos Velasco Carballo (Spain) So Bosnia manager has reverted to a 4-4-2 formation having initially stuck with 4-5-1 for his side's opening two World Cup matches. Man City frontman Edin Dzeko, who has played as the sole frontman so far in this tournament, is joined in attack by Vedad Ibisevic. The Stuttgart striker's introduction against Argentina had the desired impact as the forward found the net. Perhaps Bosnia would still have a chance of going through had they played with two strikers all along... we'll see how they do this evening. Alireza Haghighi, Hosseini, Sadeghi, Montazeri, Pouladi, Teymourian, Nekounam, Dejagah, Shojaei, Hajsafi, Ghoochannejhad. Begovic, Vrsajevic, Sunjic, Spahic, Kolasinac, Hadzic, Pjanic, Besic, Susic, Dzeko, Ibisevic. Tonight could be very interesting... Should Iran claim a 1-0 victory and Nigeria lose to Argentina by the same scoreline both teams will finish the group stage with IDENTICAL records. Therefore, FIFA will flip a coin or draw lots to decide which team goes through. No team has ever been eliminated from a World Cup by the drawing of lots. Click the above link for the full story. Iran need a win against Bosnia and will progress to the last 16 should Nigeria lose to Argentina.

"Three suspected Al Qaeda terrorists arrested in Spain last week could have been planning to launch a devastating attack on a busy Gibraltar shopping centre from the air. Spanish security services suspect the trio - two Chechen Russians and a Turk - were planning to assault the British colony to the south of Spain from above. The exact date of the alleged planned attack is unknown - but Spanish media today suggested launching it during the Olympics would have guaranteed maximum publicity for the terror organisation. Suspects: Russians of Chechen descent Eldar Magomedov (left), Mohamed Ankari Adamov (centre) and Turkish engineer Cengiz Yalcin (right) Target: The British colony of Gibraltar could have been hit by a terrorist attack from the air, sources are claiming . And El País newspaper has reported how the Turkish 'facilitator of the cell' Cengiz Yalcin was a keen paraglider and model aeroplane enthusiast and was learning how to fly. He was also paying for the two Russians of Chechen descent - Eldar Magomedov, who is said to be a former member of Soviet Union Special Forces, and Mohamed Ankari Adamov - to learn how to pilot a small plane. Yalcin is also said to have asked his paragliding instructor for aerial photographs of a Gibraltar shopping mall 'whatever the cost'. He said it was for works that his construction firm, for whom he had worked for several years, was about to embark on. And Spanish investigators today also said they had found a video where Yalvin was flying a remote-controlled aeroplane. At a prepared moment, the plane, one or two metres long, manouevres into a descent and lets a packet drop from inside. On the ground, El País reports, Yalcin is seen celebrating the feat. Police operation: Vehicles and personnel from the Spanish Police are seen outside an apartment at los Junquillos district in La Linea de la Concepcion, Cadiz, Southern Spain . Lethal: Police found enough explosives to blow up a bus at the property in La Linea de la Concepcion, Cadiz, Southern Spain . Despite today's press coverage, no mention was made in yesterday's report by Judge Pablo Ruiz into whether the suspects may have been planning a terror attack using paragliders. One of the three suspected Al Qaeda terrorists was a former member of Soviet Union Special Forces, it was claimed yesterday. Right wing Madrid daily newspaper La Razon said Eldar Magomedov was considered by Western secret services as one of the most dangerous men currently at Al Qaeda's disposal. He was described as a highly trained expert in making car bombs, carrying-out attacks with aircraft and in trains and underground rail systems. There had been a world-wide alert out to trace the man who had first learned his skills as a member of the Special Forces during the end of the Soviet era. He is then said to have honed them to perfection at Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He had been sent to become Al Qaeda's 'military chief' in Europe, La Razon reported. But the Judge did detain indefinitely the Russians yesterday and charged them with belonging to an unnamed terror organisation and possession of explosives. He also said Yalcin, the Turkish engineer who worked in Gibraltar for years and was arrested in the same case, had paid for Spanish paragliding lessons for the men. He said in a statement there was evidence linking them with 'belonging to or forming part of a terrorist organisation'. The terror group was not specified, but Spanish authorities previously said it was Al Qaeda, and the Islamic network has many affiliates. The two Russians were driven to the court in dark unmarked government cars under tight security yesterday morning, escorted by police officers wearing masks to hide their identities. Judge Pablo Ruz ordered both jailed incommunicado and indefinitely until a date is set for court proceedings, the court statement said. Ruz said he decided to approve the charges after reviewing evidence provided by the U.S. Justice Department. It included information from a witness currently under government protection, French judicial authorities and the police services of Gibraltar and Russia. The Turk was charged Friday with the . possession of explosives and a device that could be used in a terror . attack. He was also placed under preventive detention under Spain's . anti-terror laws. Target: It is not known if the trio were attempting to target the Olympics in London . Yalcin worked for years in the construction industry in Gibraltar and the explosive material was seized at his property in the southwestern Spanish city of La Linea, just across the border from the British colony and naval base.There was enough to blow up a bus, sources said. The judge's statement said the two Russians had also been living in La Linea, and that other evidence seized from Yalcin included passport photographs of the Russians and other videos that could suggest preparation for a terror attack. Evidence provided by Russia linked Magomedov with international terrorist organisations and said that he had been in Pakistan and Afghanistan in 2010, the statement said. Ruz's statement said evidence from the U.S. revealed that Magomedov may have acted under the pseudonym of Muslin Dost. It said he had been involved in terrorist activity in 2010 in Afghanistan and Waziristan, a lawless mountainous region in the northwest of Pakistan known as a terror training ground. Both men traveled to France before entering Spain in April or May this year, where they stayed in La Linea. While there both men allegedly took paragliding lessons paid for by Yalcin, the judge said. The Russians were allegedly heading back to France when police moved in to arrest them in the central city of Ciudad Real. On alert: Police have arrested dozens of Al Qaeda suspects following the Madrid train bombings captured in CCTV footage above . Neither had any identification documents but each is known by several aliases, the statement said. While Ruz's statement did not reveal the name of the terror organisation the Russians are suspected of belonging to, it said both 'partially acknowledged' links to it. Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz on Thursday described the Russians as suspected Al Qaeda members and said the Turk was suspected of being a facilitator for them. Yalcin was arrested on Thursday in La Linea while the Russians were nabbed on Wednesday as they traveled by bus from the southern city of Cadiz toward the French border crossing at Irun. Cadiz is very close to the large U.S. military base in Rota alongside the Mediterranean. Fernando Reinares, a former senior anti-terrorism adviser to the Spanish government, said evidence uncovered so far shows 'this isn't a case of an independent homegrown radicalised cell. 'This is a local facilitator and two operatives coming from abroad on a mission with a connection to Al Qaeda.' Governments and experts in recent years have highlighted jihadists who radicalise on their own without direct connections to terror groups as a growing threat. But Reinares said the Spain case underscores how organised cells with links to known groups are still dangerous. 'The whole story is very serious,' said Reinares, now a terror expert with the Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid. 'It shows they were trying most likely to target something from the air.' Spanish police have arrested dozens of Al Qaeda suspects since the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, and more after the 2004 train bombings in Madrid. Most Islamic-based terror arrests in Spain over the last several years have been of lower-level players and people trying to recruit jihadists. But the detention of the Russians and the Turk was significant because of their apparent high level of training and capability, said Magnus Ranstorp, a terror expert at the Swedish National Defence College.","Two Russians and a Turk 'planned assault on British colony from above'

"Eliot Spitzer had a big night of partying on Monday just hours before filing for divorce from his wife of 26-years, as reports reveal that he was seen at a Manhattan bar with his new girlfriend and friends order rounds of drinks. Spitzer, 54, and his former campaign aide turned girlfriend Lis Smith, 31, went to a rowdy bar after seeing the Knicks basketball game in Madison Square Garden on Monday night. 'The whole group seemed pretty excited and giddy. When the server came, the ordering was chaotic; they were shouting out ‘sliders,’ ‘wings,’ and each time an order was submitted they were cheering and high-fiving each other,' an unidentified spectator at Brother Jimmy's BBQ reports. Split: Silda Wall and her husband Eliot Spitzer have both filed for a divorce after 26-years of marriage and they could not come to a suitable arrangement after initially announcing that they wanted an uncontested divorce . 'They seemed already drunk and . ordered vodka, a margarita, and a beer tower, which is four pitchers in . one container,' the spy told The New York Post. 'They . were jubilant, joking constantly, high-fiving and really excitable. They were drinking and having fun. Eliot seemed so happy, he paid for . the entire check and tipped 25 percent, before he staggered out around . 12.30am with Lis Smith on his arm.' Though . the Knicks had just won the game with just a two point lead, the timing . of Spitzer's celebration undoubtedly had something to do with his . impending divorce hearing. Spitzer . and his wife Silda Wall filed for divorce on Tuesday and were . attempting to avoid a bitter battle over the family's millions, but . apparently that plan went by the wayside as they were not able to strike . a deal. According to a . statement issued before their Tuesday meeting by the estranged couple's . spokeswoman, Lisa Linden,  'all issues between us have been resolved . and are uncontested' - meaning they were not planning on engaging in a . lengthy legal fight. Infamous: New York Governor Eliot Spitzer (R) announces his resignation as his wife Silda Wall Spitzer stands next to him March 12, 2008 in New York City . The . divorce announcement comes almost six years after Spitzer, 54, . announced his resignation as governor with Silda by his side following . revelations that he had been frequenting prostitutes while in office. Earlier, court documents labeled the split as 'contested', leading to speculation that Spitzer's well documented affairs with call-girls and the fact that he is a multimillionaire in control of his family's real estate business could be reasons for Silda to seek damages. However, the statement issued this evening now clarifies that the couple, who have three grown-up daughters, will proceed to end their marriage as amicably as possible. The legal filing in New York City follows the joint statement the couple made in December announcing that their marriage was over. This came after the New York Daily News revealed that Spitzer, known as the infamous Client No.9 had begun a romantic relationship with his former press aid, Lis Smith - who worked on his failed bid to be City Comptroller last year. Indeed, Spitzer was introduced to his new 31-year-old girlfriend's family over Christmas and the couple took a romantic trip to Jamaica over the New Year - which reportedly included an amorous session inside an outdoor hot-tub. Family: New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer, right, arrives for a church service in Albany, N.Y, with his wife Silda and three daughters in this Jan. 1, 2007 file photo . Spitzer, who was once considered a future presidential candidate, met his wife Silda at Harvard Law School in 1987. The couple had three daughters together as Spitzer rose the ranks from successful lawyer to prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's office. He became state Attorney General in 1998 and found fame as the 'Sheriff of Wall Street' - going after corrupt financiers. His moral authority and intellect helped catapult him into the governor's office in 2007 - however he resifned in disgrace just a year later after being revealed to have a prediliction for using prostitutes. Infamous as Client 9 of the Emporers Club VIP call-girl ring, he resigned at a public press conference with his wife by his side. He then attempted to rehabilitate his public image with a stint presenting a CNN news show which failed and then eventually made his way back to work for his father Bernard Spitzer - the legendary New York real estate mogul. Different public appearance: Lis Smith and Eliot Spitzer (seen here during his failed campaign for comptroller) made their first outing together on Christmas since news of their affair broke . Smith, left, worked on Spitzer's campaign and . then jumped over to work for Bill De Blasio after Spitzer lost in the . primary. Silda Spitzer, right, was not seen on the campaign trail for . her husband . Lis Smith had been considered for a senior role within de Blasio's permanent team but those plans were sunk once her relationship with Spitzer became public knowledge . The couple had long been known to be leading separate lives - despite Spitzer maintaining that he and his 56-year-old wife were still together as he attempted to gain election as city comptroller. However, she never appeared at any event son the campaign trail and one source close to the former governor confirmed to the New York Daily News that they had separated. The couple released a statement in December to MailOnline after Spitzer, 54, was pictured slipping into the home of 31-year-old Lis Smith, a press secretary who worked on his failed bid for New York City Comptroller. 'We regret that our marital relationship has come to an end and we have agreed not to make any other public statement on this subject,' Spitzer family spokeswoman Lisa Linden said in a terse statement released on Tuesday night. Scandal: The alleged prostitute at the centre of former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer's sex scandal has broken her silence. Ashley Youmans was named by the New York Times as the high-price prostitute . Multiple reports indicate that the Spitzers have been living apart for some time. Mrs Spitzer was also noticeably absent from the campaign trail this past year. The couple have three grown daughters together: Elyssa, 23, Sarabeth, 20, and Jenna, 18. Spitzer and his wife Silda stayed married for five and a half years after the scandal that cratered his meteoric political career. It's unknown whether the timing of Silda and Eliot's split has anything to do with the his relationship with Miss Smith going public. A friend of the new couple told MailOnline: 'The relationship began long after Eliot and his wife were living separately and it was not a secret to any of their friends or family. 'It's sad to see lots of outright lies about Lis and her career - Lis is an incredibly smart and dynamic woman who is at the top of her profession and is universally respected. 'She's dealing with this well and is looking forward to getting on with her career and life.'","The disgraced former Governor and friends were seen partying at a bar on Monday night just hours before he and his wife of 26-years filed for divorce .

"Situated behind iron railings on a strip of barren scrub land, the pokey Georgian house looks rather out of place in London's fashionable Southwark Street. But even more unusual is the fact the property - a stone's throw away from the bustling Borough market - has been slowly melting. The two-floor property is actually an art installation made of wax bricks. After standing firm since September 26, the creation is dissolving into a pile of sludge and will be removed tomorrow. Entitled A Pound Of Flesh For 50p (The Melting House), was the brainchild of British artist and designer Alex Chinneck, who is well known for creating optical illusions. He constructed the artwork (whose name is a nod to a line from The Merchant Of Venice) from 8,000 cast paraffin wax bricks 'cemented' between terracotta sand. The house has been melted manually with heating tools used by the building trade to enable the artist maintain control over how it dissolves. He built it in homage to a candle-making factory that stood in the area more than 100 years ago. Over the last 12 months, Mr Chinneck has liaised with engineers and wax specialists to make the brickwork look as convincing as possible.

"A fire crew called to treat a California man who had collapsed while mowing his lawn ensured not only that he was okay but even finished his gardening chores for him. The Corona Fire Department’s moto is ‘serving our city with pride’ and that is certainly what they did on Wednesday morning after receiving the call for help. The crew from Engine 1 was responding to a call about an unnamed resident who had lost consciousness while mowing his lawn. A photo posted on the department's Facebook shows two crew members from the Corona Fire Department sweeping up grass clippings on the sidewalk outside the man's home . First the responders provided advanced life support treatment to the man and ensured he was sent to hospital in an ambulance for a checkup. But then two members of the crew stayed and finished the gardening while the man’s wife and baby prepared to go to the hospital. They even put his lawn mower back in the garage. A photo posted on the department’s Facebook shows two crew members sweeping up grass clippings on the sidewalk outside the man's home. ‘We do that a lot. We look after our community - it’s pretty tightly knit,’ Fire Departments spokeswoman Lynn Mata told KTLA. The gardener, who hit his nose when he collapsed, is described as being ‘in pretty good shape’ after the 11 a.m. emergency response, according to Mata. The incident follows a similar heart-warming in Bayton, Texas, at the beginning of September. One neighbor spotted the kind act and snapped photographs of Baytown firefighter Blake Steffenauer pushing a lawnmower . John McCormick, 67, who had a history of heart problems, passed away two days after his heart attack . Paramedics responded to a 911 call for a man - John McCormick, 67 - who fell ill while doing his garden. After they had taken the man to hospital firefighters returned and began to mow the lawm. When they had finished they too locked the lawnmower up in the garage. They also left a note behind addressed to Mr McCormick's wife. 'We felt bad that your husband didn't get to finish the yard,' the firefighters said and added they would help in the future. 'We are very sorry that your husband became ill, we hope he has a speedy recovery,' they said. 'Let us know if there is anything we can do to help you out.' One neighbor spotted the kind act and snapped photographs of firefighter Blake Steffenauer pushing the mower. Other members of the Bayton community praised the firefighters. 'All of our City employees are proud to serve the citizens of Baytown, but this is truly special,' the city said in a statement posted on Facebook. 'We couldn't be prouder of our guys from Station 4. Our prayers are with the family at this sad time.' Sadly Mr McCormick, who had a history of heart problems, passed away two days after his heart attack.","Engine 1 from the Corona Fire Department was called to treat a California man who had collapsed while mowing his lawn last Wednesday .

"Standing at the altar with beaming smiles, the couple show off their wedding rings in front of dozens of amused guests. This selfie of Andrew and Sally Rose Robinson - taken just seconds after they tied the knot - has won the World Selfie Awards 2014. The couple, both 30, had just exchanged vows when they borrowed the best man's iPhone and took the photo at Christ Church in Treales, Lanchashire. Although they left many guests stunned, they had already gained permission from the vicar to snap the selfie as a 'bit of fun'. Scroll down for video . We're married! This selfie of Andrew and Sally Rose Robinson, both 30, was taken just seconds after they tied the knot at Christ Church in Treales, Lancashire. The incredible image has won the World Selfie Awards 2014 . They then decided to submit it to the global competition, run by online smartphone retailer Mobiles.co.uk, after seeing an advertisement for it online. Mrs Robinson, a nurse at Royal Preston Hospital, said: 'I'm not really into Twitter or things like that but Andy saw the competition on there and decided to send it in - I had no idea.' Mr Robinson added: 'I joked about taking a selfie at the wedding rehearsal as all our friends take them when we are out, but thought I'd be too nervous to do it on the day. As it turned out I wasn't, so we decided to go for it, with the vicar's approval, on my best man's iPhone. 'We thought the photo looked great, especially with the family in the background, so we put it on Facebook and it went huge.' Success: Tom Morton, who snapped a selfie with singer Miley Cyrus, won the 'Celeb Photobomb' award; one of five available in the contest. Right, another entrant manages to capture the Duchess of Cambridge in his snap . Dressing up: This photo features two people dressed up as Rodney and 'Del Boy' from Only Fools And Horses . The couple, who met at secondary school and got engaged two years ago at the top of the Empire State Building, married on June 7. Mrs Robinson described their wedding selfie as 'nice, fun thing to do', but said it had left some of her elderly relatives a bit confused. 'A few of my older relatives were a little confused as they couldn't really figure out what we were doing,' she said. 'But if other people feel like doing it at their wedding, they should just go for it.' Mr Robinson, a chartered surveyor, added that he was 'surprised' to hear the image had scooped first prize in the Awards. Having a laugh: Other entries into the competition included a man posing in front of a model dinosaur (left) and a woman smiling with a magician seemingly floating in the air in the background . 'I was surprised when I heard we'd won and actually checked to see if it was for real as we've never won anything before,' he said. The couple, who are currently living in Manchester but will shortly be moving to Preston, Lancashire, beat more than 300 entrants to win the top prize. They will now receive a smartphone of their choice and a crystalised award etched with a permanent reminder of their selfie. Mobiles.co.uk, run by Carphone Warehouse, asked members of the public to share their best selfies for the chance to win one of five awards, including the top prize won by the Robinsons, 'The WTF Selfie' and 'Celeb Photobomb'. Bizarre: Abby Francis, from Mobiles.co.uk, said: 'Selfies have become a viral sensation thanks to the smartphone, so we thought we'd challenge people to really show us how it's done'. Above, two more entries . The winner of 'Celeb Photobomb' was Tom Morton, who snapped a selfie with singer Miley Cyrus.

"A law student was convicted of possessing a bomb making manual during a secret trial at the Old Bailey, it can be revealed for the first time today. Police found the document on a memory card belonging to Erol Incedal and the jury found him guilty on the basis it was was likely to be useful to a terrorist, it can now be reported. But the jury was discharged from further deliberations on another charge of preparing an act of terrorism with others abroad. He was charged with preparing an act of terrorism with others abroad, either against individuals or a 'Mumbai-style' attack. Guilty: Erol Incedal, centre, was found guilty of possessing a bomb making manual on a memory card but will face a new trial on the charge of preparing a terrorist act, which he denies . Today  Mr Justice Nicol removed an order banning publication of the jury's unanimous guilty verdict on a charge of possessing information likely to be useful to a terrorist. He said it was no longer necessary after ruling that this verdict was admissible at the retrial due to take place on February 23 next year. Incedal's friend Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar, also 26, has already pleaded guilty to possessing the bomb making manual. During Incedal's trial, the court heard that he  was stopped and arrested by police on September 30 last year for driving his black Mercedes car at 60mph in a 40mph zone with no licence and insurance. Officers discovered a slip of paper with the address of former prime minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie on it in the car and planted a bug which picked up Incedal's conversations in the following days. The Turkish-born defendant was heard on tape to complain about 'pigs' to his wife and talking about going to a 'Plan B'. He said: 'I made a big mistake. Some very important stuff was in the car. If they find it, I would be f*****.' On October 13 last year, armed police stopped Incedal's car again near London Bridge and arrested him on suspicion of being a terrorist. They searched the Turkish-born father-of-two's home address in  south London, where they found notes on a 'Plan A'. It detailed a checklist of 'three to four workers, two tennis racquets, one month's surveillance, rent nearby flat, transport, assess security, assess risk, legitimacy, action etc', the court heard. And at a second shared flat near Paddington, officers uncovered a laptop computer containing coded messages about a Mumbai-style attack and a Kalashnikov rifle, the court has heard. New trial: A judge, sitting at the Old Bailey (pictured), ordered a retrial, which it is believed will take place in February . They also discovered a photograph of an East End synagogue on his iPhone as well as an internet search history including YouTube pages on Isis. In his defence, Incedal denied that he had been planning a terrorist attack. He accepted that he possessed the memory card but said he had a reasonable excuse for it. The majority of the Old Bailey trial has been heard behind closed doors, at times with accredited journalists present but unable to report on proceedings, which have been mainly in secret. In all, 40 hours of evidence was heard behind closed doors, eight hours with accredited reporters present and 12 hours in open court. Incedal was formerly known in the court case as AB and his co-defendant Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar, 26, who has admitted possessing an identical bomb-making document, as CD. The exceptional and controversial arrangements for the secret trial were made after a media challenge at the High Court against the entire case being heard in secret on grounds of national security. As well as opening up the case to partial reporting, it led to the defendants being named in public for the first time. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Erol Incedal, 26, guilty of having bomb-making manual on memory card .

"History presenter Dan Snow and his heiress wife Lady Edwina Grosvenor have said they do not want their huge inheritance to be a burden to their children and might give it away to charity. The broadcaster, 35, married philanthropist and second-born child of the Duke of Westminster four years ago and have a three-year-old daughter, with a baby boy on the way. The couple both came from wealthy backgrounds – the young historian is the son of BBC presenter Peter Snow while Lady Edwina’s father is Britain’s richest landowner – and say their children won't need all of their fortune. Scroll down for video . Dan Snow, 35, with his wife Lady Edwina Grosvenor, 32, (left) who are considering giving their inheritance away . Snow told The Times: ‘It may be that we form an arrangement whereby our children don’t grow up wealthy. My wife and I are talking to a lot of people about it. We’re working a lot of things out. She has embarked on a career in philanthropy. She gives a lot of money away at the moment. The question is does she give away everything? And that’s something that’s very much been talked about’. Lady Edwina could be set to inherit a slice of her father’s £8.5 billion fortune, which currently places him tenth on the Sunday Times Rich List 2014, and makes him the third richest British citizen. Her family counts the Prince of Wales among their friends while her mother Tally is Prince William’s godmother and she herself is a goddaughter of the late Diana, Princess of Wales. And her husband, who was educated at St Paul’s and Oxford University, is the great-great-grandson of British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and great-grandson of World War I general Sir Thomas D’Olyly Snow. His aunt is Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan and his father’s cousin is Channel 4 news reporter Jon Snow. Snow graduated with first class honours in Modern History from the University of Oxford before beginning his presenting career. He now has a stint on BBC's The One Show and is well-known for shows with his father . Lady Edwina is a trustee of The Clink Charity and has spent millions helping ex-prisoners turn their lives around . Despite their wealth the pair chose to have a low-key wedding when they married at Bishop’s Lodge in Woolton, Liverpool in 2010. The couple live on the edge of the New Forest in a house purchased from former notorious mercenary Simon Mann – but they still have a nanny and a gardener. In contrast to Edwina’s low-key wedding, her sister Tamara, 31, married Prince Charles’s godson, Edward van Cutsem, 36, in the winter of 2004 at Chester Cathedral in a ceremony attended by the Queen. She also has a brother, Hugh, and a sister, Viola, who are 11 and 12 years younger than her. Her sister Tamara's wedding (pictured) was a more grand affair and was attended by the Queen after she married Prince Charles' godson, Edward van Cutsem in the winter of 2004 at Chester Cathedral . Pictured as a teenager, Lady Edwina (centre red shirt) poses with her sister Tamara, father Duke of Westminster, younger brother Hugh (on his father's lap), sister Viola and their mother Duchess of Westminster . The Duke of Westminster is number 10 on the Sunday Times Rich List and is worth £8.5 billion . They were brought up at Eaton Hall in Cheshire - the 10,872-acre country estate home of the Duke and Duchess of Westminster. All of the Grosvenor children were sent to a state school on the Wirral, which has since closed, rather than single-sex boarding schools. Now Lady Edwina, 32, is on a mission to help former offenders and has spent millions of pounds trying to help turn their lives around. As a trustee of The Clink Charity, she has been a part of launching a chain of quality restaurants in prisons which give inmates the opportunity to learn how to cook, serve and perform front-of-house duties. Last year – two years after their daughter was born - the couple miscarried quite into the pregnancy and they are now expecting a son who is due in a couple of weeks. But discussions over whether Zia and their new baby will inherit all of their fortune remains to be seen. ‘There’s a great quote from the Scottish entrepreneur Tom Hunter. He thinks it’s a good idea to leave kids an amount of money that means they can do something but not so much that they can do nothing,’ said Snow. ‘You can raise them above subsistence and you can allow them to think about a career that isn’t hugely financially rewarding’. Whether they decide to pass on their fortune or not, their children will inherit a remarkable pedigree.

"I saw Juan Cuadrado playing for Colombia against Uruguay at the World Cup last year. When Chelsea signed him, I went back and looked through my notes from that game. Two words were underlined: great talent. Cuadrado has the pace, skill and imagination to breathe new life into Chelsea. Make no mistake, this boy can play. In that last-16 game against Uruguay he was overshadowed by a fantastic performance from James Rodriguez but Cuadrado was one of the stars of the tournament. Juan Cuadrado poses with the Chelsea shirt after joining the club for £27million on transfer deadline day . Cuadrado (left) was one of the standout performers at last summer's World Cup for Colombia . Cuadrado's (left) style of play fits in perfectly with manager Jose Mourinho’s ‘new’ Chelsea . The Colombia international's attacking flair is reminiscent to Ronaldinho's (right) during his Barcelona days . The way he goes past people with a quick shimmy reminds me of Ronaldinho. He dribbles at pace effortlessly and his spider-like legs seem able to control the ball in the tightest spaces. Even his hairstyle is similar to the great Brazilian. He plays with a smile on his face and is the kind of player who gets people out of their seats. He fits in perfectly with Jose Mourinho’s ‘new’ Chelsea - a creative winger capable of unlocking the door. Mourinho clearly didn’t fancy Andre Schurrle and swapping him for Cuadrado shows how far the Portuguese boss has evolved. Ten years ago, Schurrle would have been the perfect fit for Jose’s title-winning Chelsea side. He is a stereotypical German player - mechanical and efficient - and was excellent as a super-sub at the World Cup. But he was too robotic for the new Mourinho. Now Jose has a squad bursting with creative talent. If Schurrle was a functional part of the engine then Cuadrado is the spark to get Chelsea in gear. They have looked leggy in recent weeks, particularly against Manchester City after that epic semi-final against Liverpool, and Jose will be delighted to have a new face to freshen things up. Cuadrado replaces Andre Schurrle who was sold to Bundesliga side Wolfsburg for £24million . Schurrle poses with Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking (left) and sporting director Klaus Allofs (right) Eden Hazard, Oscar and Willian have been exceptional this season, but they play at such a high intensity that they need someone to share the load. Having Cuadrado as another option will help them recharge their batteries. Mourinho clearly felt unable to trust Schurrle and Mohamed Salah with that role and they were ruthlessly shipped out last month. Cuadrado will have to pull his weight. Jose will drill those defensive responsibilities into him but there will be no worries about his attacking prowess. He is just as energetic as the rest of the Chelsea midfield but where Hazard and Willian often cut inside and move across the pitch, the Colombian loves to go down the line. One of his favourite moves is to drive straight at a defender, stop them in their tracks and throw a feint before charging past in the outside lane. He is so explosive from a standing start that he knows he has the beating of his man over a short distance. Sometimes he’s quite old-fashioned and he’s not afraid of a bit of push-and-run. I’m sure the late, great Sir Stanley Matthews, who retired 50 years ago on Friday, would have enjoyed watching him. Cuadrado's attacking qualities will give Chelsea an added edge as they chase three trophies this season . Cuadrado's arrival will serve as added competition to Oscar (left) and Eden Hazard (centre) at the Blues . It will be interesting to see how Mourinho uses Cuadrado. He has the flexibility to play on either side or through the middle, but the most important thing he brings is increased competition for places. Chelsea were guilty of complacency last year, and that’s why they lost the title. Oscar downed tools in readiness for the World Cup, Mourinho had a pop at Hazard for not working hard enough and they lost games you would never expect a Mourinho side to lose - Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Sunderland. With a player of Cuadrado’s quality arriving, there is no way any players will be dropping into their comfort zone. Internal competition has to be fierce if you want to reach the top and if Jose doesn’t like you, it won’t be long before he cuts you adrift. Mourinho has previously talked about some of his players as ‘untouchable’. He has his favourites now but with Cuadrado’s talent, there might be a few unhappy faces as the fight for places heats up. The north London and Merseyside derbies are cracking games but, having played in both, I found a healthier atmosphere in Liverpool. It felt more like a footballing family. Rivalry was fierce but there was respect. In north London, after Sol Campbell moved from Spurs to Arsenal, it was venomous and hard to believe people could be so aggressive towards 11 players. In Sol’s first game back at White Hart Lane, when our coach was heading up Tottenham High Road, the police were trying to contain the fans. There were bottles thrown and the back windows of our coach were smashed. But we used that to motivate us. Every Thursday I will answer your questions live on MailOnline.

"I will never forget my first training session at Monaco. In all the years I've played football, I never stood on the ball. But there was something about the unfamiliarity after 13 years at Tottenham which must have distracted me or overawed me. Because, sure enough, in the middle of that first training session when I was desperate to make an impression, I stood on the ball and almost ended up on my backside. Mark Hateley, who had been signed with me, was killing himself laughing. I shouted over to him: 'I bet they're wondering just what they've signed here!' But I was mortified. I was determined to prove myself and for some reason nerves or expectations had got the better of me. Glenn Hoddle (right) pictured in 1987 during a training session with Monaco after leaving Tottenham Hotspur . It is a good illustration of the challenges a move abroad can bring. Things which seemed simple when playing in familiar surroundings take on a new dimension, both in the football world and the wider culture. I had the language to deal with off the pitch and on the pitch I was really frustrated early on that I wasn't getting the ball enough. I was used to being at the heart of Tottenham's game but you had to prove yourself all over again to a new coaching staff and new players. I mention this now because of Steven Gerrard's announcement that he will be joining LA Galaxy. I think it will be a fantastic experience for him, even at this stage of his career. And though I, like many, can't help admiring his loyalty and commitment to Liverpool over the years, there is a little part of me that would have loved to have seen him make the move abroad a few years ago, at the peak of his career. It is said he had opportunities to join Real Madrid and I'm sure all the leading clubs from the top leagues would have been interested in signing him if there had been an opportunity. Of course, everyone is different and I totally respect his decision to stay at Liverpool. But he might have become an even better player had he gone abroad earlier. Just being in a different country and a different culture changes you. Tactically it is a challenge. When I left for Monaco, English football was still very stuck in a similar way of playing, with 4-4-2 the standard, something I had become very used to. Steven Gerrard has guaranteed LA Galaxy supporters that they can expect 100 per cent commitment . Gerrard admitted that he was a 'Scouser through and through' and would have to adapt to a new lifestyle . Sportsmail’s mock-up of how Gerrard could look in the colours of MLS outfit LA Galaxy . In France I suddenly found myself being man-marked, which had never happened in England. I had to adjust my game, coming behind the ball a little and getting into false positions, to cause my marker problems and give him decisions to make. It made me think that little bit harder. Every day you were challenged off the pitch, whether it was because of the language or eating habits or cultural differences. Like Steven, I had young daughters at the time, so living near the beach and in a sunny climate was just fantastic. Ultimately, I think that made me more open as a person. It made me open my mind to new ideas. The huge difference then was the approach to diet and medicine in France and England. Don't forget we had a young Arsene Wenger in charge at Monaco and at that stage the French, in general, and Arsene, in particular, were miles ahead of the English. There was a magnificent osteopath there at the time called Michel Franco who opened my eyes to all sorts of things in terms of injury prevention. At training we had all the masseurs and chiropractors that are now normal in England but weren't then. Gerrard assured Liverpool fans that his departure will not spell the end of his relationship with the club . The stretching was new to me and the diet was completely different. These things were a revelation to me at the time. Of course, those differences wouldn't be so pronounced now but there will be other areas in which things will be done differently that will make you think. It doesn't necessarily have to be a wrench to go; fans are much more likely to understand if you're clear with them and move abroad rather than to a direct rival. I did 13 years at Tottenham as a pro and I'd always made it pretty well known that I wanted to challenge myself abroad. I can't remember any fans giving me a hard time; I think they understood. Steven has had a wonderful career at Liverpool, whereas my ambition had always been to play abroad. I nearly went to FC Koln in Germany when I was 21 and then to Napoli after the 1982 World Cup, when Rudi Krol was there. Finally, at the age of 28, the right move came to Monaco. I never regretted it and I'm sure Steven won't regret this new phase of his life. There has been a lot of focus on refereeing standards over the Christmas period but for me it has highlighted that they need more help in the modern game, which is so much quicker and intense than ever before. And there are a couple of areas in which I would love to see a clampdown. The first is diving. It is an attempt to cheat a fellow professional and in that way is as bad as an over-the-top tackle. It seems impossible for a referee to make a 100 per cent accurate judgment in real time as to whether a player is diving — the Cesc Fabregas case at Southampton, where he was wrongly booked, was a good illustration of that. Equally, some players are getting away with it. There has been a lot of focus on refereeing standards in the Premier League over the Christmas period . There should be a facility to review games on TV at the end of the weekend and then punish players or exonerate them retrospectively. That would also act as a deterrent to a player for whom diving is a part of the game. He might get away with it on the pitch, but the TV cameras would invariably catch him. But the other aspect of the game which I want to see stamped out wouldn’t need TV replays: it is players brandishing imaginary cards in an attempt to encourage the referee to book or send an opponent off. Whenever that happens I think the referee should have the power to simply reverse the decision and award the free kick the other way. It would soon stop then. Players brandishing imaginary cards to encourage the referee to book or send an opponent off needs to go . As a player in the Eighties, winning the FA Cup was as important as winning the league. In fact, some fans and players would prioritise it above the league. I was lucky enough to win finals, so it was a special tournament for me. Last weekend we at QPR had a dreadful result against Sheffield United but it again illustrated what an extraordinary competition it can be. Glenn Hoddle (left) and Steve Archibald hold up the FA Cup after beating QPR at Wembley in 1982 . Last Monday, as AFC Wimbledon contended with Liverpool, the game could have gone either way at 1-1. There were plenty of ties like that, with Blyth Spartans, Yeovil and Cambridge United all playing their part. It was a good weekend for the competition. The FA Cup might never be what it was but it is an important part of the football calendar and, bit by bit, is recovering its old glory.

"In a few months’ time, when Frank Lampard heads out to the United States to start a new career with New York City, there is a danger that he will be lost to English football. The FA cannot allow that to happen. They are already in talks to make him an ambassador for the national team, but it cannot end there. He still has much to offer. At the age of 36 Lampard will be a star when he moves to New York, just as he is here after a decorated career for club and country. Frank Lampard (left) training ahead of Manchester City's Champions League tie with Roma . David Beckham was part of Fabio Capello's management team at the 2010 World Cup while Gary Neville is the current England No 2 - both have the knowledge to become the next national team boss . Manchester City’s midfielder is an intelligent and reasoned guy. Those qualities have served him well over the years, engaging with fans, media, managers and coaches at West Ham, Chelsea, Manchester City and England. The FA, rightly, have picked up on it. He is one of the Golden Generation, among a number of players from the Sven Goran Eriksson era who can help to shape the future of the English game. There should be nothing to stop Ledley King, Sol Campbell, Jamie Carragher, John Terry, Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, David Beckham, Michael Owen, Lampard, or others becoming the next England manager. Throw that lot into a room with some sandwiches and a few pots of coffee for a couple of hours and you would soon hear some of the best ideas in the sport. These boys have The Knowledge. Surely they have so much to give after careers that took them to World Cup quarter-finals against Brazil (2002) and Portugal (2006). Even the bad memories, such as the failure to qualify for Euro 2008 or the 4-1 defeat against Germany at the 2010 World Cup, can be used to England’s advantage. It would be foolish not to tap into these resources. With the exception of Gary Neville (who already holds the Pro Licence), if any of those players committed themselves to the idea of becoming England’s head coach, there would be a clamour for one of them to be given the job inside five years. The younger players would have caught the tail end of their illustrious careers and could still associate with their dressing room mentality. The Golden Generation would still have their respect. If they don’t want to be in the frame to succeed Roy Hodgson, then there should be opportunities elsewhere within the organisation for some of the most experienced heads in the game. John Terry (left) could be another candidate and has shown he has the nous by effectively managing Chelsea here in a crucial Champions League last 32 match against Napoli in 2012 . In Germany, Mattias Sammer was technical director of the national team between 2005 and 2012. He has since taken a role as sporting director at Bayern Munich. Former Germany striker Oliver Bierhoff is the country’s general manager, a role created during the leadership of Jurgen Klinsmann, another former player. Christian Ziege, who had spells with Liverpool and Tottenham during his playing career, has been coaching Germany’s Under-18 and Under-19 teams since 2011. Steffen Freund, now assistant head coach at White Hart Lane, was in charge of the German Under-16 and 17 teams before he returned to work in north London. Paul Scholes (left), Phil Neville (centre) and Nicky Butt have coaching experience at Manchester United . Jamie Carragher is an excellent Sportsmail columnist and Sky Sports pundit but could be a good manager . It sounds like jobs for the boys, but experience counts at the very highest level. It is the right time for the FA to milk it. A couple of weeks ago Sportsmail’s Martin Keown told a story about an offer he once made to the FA to travel around Europe at his own expense to pick up tips from the world’s best coaches. No-one got back to him. It seemed like a pretty good offer. Keown, a former England international with 43 caps and numerous honours at Arsenal, wanted to be part of the international set up. This week the FA have been rather more pro-active by reaching out to two of England’s most reasoned and intelligent footballers as part of a strategy to keep former players involved. Good on them for that. Former Germany striker Oliver Bierhoff is involved in the country's set-up as the general manager . There are some other ideas kicking around, such as opening an Ambassadors Club or such like at Wembley to entertain former England internationals on matchday. It seems like a neat idea, an honourable way of remembering past heroes and making sure they still have a part to play with the national team. Instead of a few ales before kick-off and some stories about the past, far better for these players to be on the fields of St George’s Park and working with the next generation of international footballers. Without them, the likes of Lampard will become the Lost Generation.","Frank Lampard has had talks with the FA to become an England ambassador .

"Last week, in the company of a Manchester United great, David Beckham spoke passionately about the spirit and soul of the club. He is fiercely protective. As a nervous, young apprentice, he recalled the cigar smoke from Sir Matt Busby’s office wafting through the corridors at Old Trafford. There was a sense of belonging about the place, and he felt the history of the club when he walked out of the tunnel at Old Trafford for the first time. Sense of history: David Beckham (right) last week enthused about his youth days at Manchester United . The Class of 92: Eric Harrison (centre) and his all-star FA Youth Cup winners, including Beckham (sixth left) Glory: The former England captain enjoys title success with fellow graduate Paul Scholes (bottom left) in 2003 . That stuff makes the hairs on your neck stand on end. It was at the stadium, after the extensive redevelopment of the Stretford End, Scoreboard End and North Stand in the Nineties, that Beckham became a modern, matchday idol. ‘Like having 75,000 parents watching you,’ he recalled during an instructive half hour with the former United and England midfielder. In many ways it was a nostalgic trip for Beckham, winding the clock back to a time when he first trained with United after winning the Bobby Charlton Soccer School one summer. Moving on up: Danny Welbeck celebrates his brilliant double for England against Switzerland on Monday . Remember the name: A young Welbeck scores a spectacular debut goal for United against Stoke in 2008 . Pastures new: The former United academy graduate has now moved on to Arsenal for £16m . Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes, the Neville brothers and Beckham were brought up at The Cliff, making their way through the academy before they went on to win the FA Youth Cup in 1992. This is all part of the club’s grand and illustrious past, but as Louis van Gaal looks to the future he must keep the spirit and soul of this club alive. This coming Friday, the United manager will speak for the first time about his decision to sell Danny Welbeck to Arsenal on transfer deadline day for £16million. On paper, with Radamel Falcao being added to a list of forwards that includes captain Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Juan Mata and Adnan Januzaj, it was a straightforward decision. Welbeck’s finest moment in a United shirt was his header at the Bernabeu in a Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid in February 2013. All in all, there were not enough of them. What cannot be ignored is his affinity to the club, joining United’s academy at the age of eight, having his picture taken with Giggs and making his way through the club’s junior teams. It is a rich tradition at United and it is possible that Van Gaal isn't even aware that they have included a homegrown player in every matchday squad since 1937. It is 3,704 games and counting. In their last Barclays Premier League game, at Burnley prior to the international break, United started with three graduates from the youth team. Five more were on the bench. That powerful statistic is not in danger yet, but a return to the days when Sir Alex Ferguson organised trials for every kid in the north west after his arrival in November 1986 are long gone. Those trials, supervised by the former youth coach Eric Harrison, harvested the Class of 92. They will never see the like again. Instead, United are operating in an era of rampant commercialisation. Every square inch of this club is for sale. Every quarter brings another outstanding set of financial results and with it the news of another sponsorship deal with a food or soda supplier from south-east Asia. To keep pace with Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona in the annual Deloitte Money League, that is what they have to do. Next season they will revert to adidas, switching kit manufacturer after striking a deal that is thought to be worth £750m over the next 10 years. These glorified announcements are a modern trend, a flag-waving exercise designed to pacify those restless supporters who are concerned about the direction of this institution. They have entered the messy world of third-party ownership after bringing Falcao on loan from Monaco for a season, with an option to sign the striker permanently next summer. He is a first-class forward, but you have to question the influence of those in his inner circle when he opted to join Monaco, a team who were not in the Champions League at the time, instead of a European superpower in 2013. Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Manchester City all turned down the chance to sign one of the world’s best forwards this summer. There has to be good reason for that. Van Gaal has not had a break since the World Cup, charging straight into his new role at United and the American tour that he complained about so bitterly. Much of that was down to his own mental fatigue. The recruitment strategy is incoherent, throwing money at the problem by signing Luke Shaw, Angel di Maria and Falcao. Splashing the cash: Radamel Falcao is Louis van Gaal's latest blockbuster signing for the Red Devils . Overhaul: The Dutch boss poses with Daley Blind after adding the defender to his rapidly-changing squad . Record breaker: Angel di Maria (right) was signed for an eyewatering £60m from Real Madrid . It is to be hoped that they all come good, particularly given the sense of urgency that has prevailed since David Moyes was fired last April. Moyes got it wrong, of course, misjudging the mood of the place after Ferguson retired after winning his 11th Premier League title in 2013. Van Gaal has promised glory eventually, committing himself to various targets over the past few weeks. Along the way, he will have to take a bit of history with him.

"Tyson Fury claims he would have an easy night's work against Wladimir Klitschko as he and Christian Hammer had to be pulled apart during a heated weigh-in. Fury is the mandatory challenger world heavyweight champion Klitschko but must avoid a slip-up against Hammer at the O2 in London on Saturday night. And the 26-year-old would rather face the Ukrainian than recently-crowned champion Deontay Wilder. Tyson Fury (left) and Christian Hammer had to be pulled apart as they clashed at the weigh-in . Tempers flared as the two heavyweights and their entourages clashed at the weigh-in . 'To be honest I'm the man in the division to beat,' Fury said. 'Everyone wants to fight me because they know I generate interest. People are interested in me probably for the wrong reasons, or the right reasons, but they're still interested - that's why people want to fight. 'They want to come to the UK to fight me. [Deontay Wilder's] the world champion but he's the guy who first said he wants to fight Tyson Fury after winning the title. So I must be doing something right, I must be on the right track. 'I would like to fight Wladimir [Klitschko] first because No 1 he's my mandatory, No 2 he's the best in the division and No 3 because he is an easy fight. Then I'll fight Wilder. I won't be taking any interim fights I'll unify straight away.' The Fury camp has been given a boost with the recent release from prison of Tyson's dad John Fury after five-years away. Fury poses during the weigh-in ahead of his heavyweight showdown with Hammer . The imposing heavyweight believes that the return of his father will be a major plus for him going forward. 'It's definitely [a boost] to have my dad back, he's been away for a long time, so having him back in the gym and seeing his face every day is very good – it's happy days at Team Fury,' he said. 'He gets to the gym at seven in the morning and doesn't leave till 10 at night; he's definitely putting his misspent time back into practice in the gym. It is nice having him around and seeing his face back in the gym and the smile on it when you're doing good things in boxing. 'Anybody would be proud of what their sons achievements are - whatever they do. You don't have to be so successful but as long as you've got somebody who tries their best in something that they're doing then I think that any father should be proud of their son. 'You don't have to be a world champion, you don't have to be a millionaire but I believe every father should be proud of his own son,' Chris Eubank Jnr also weighed in ahead of his fight with Dimtry Chudinov on Saturday . Despite talk of a world title fight in the summer, former British and Commonwealth champion Fury is well aware that he cannot overlook 27-year-old Hammer, who has 17 wins from his 20 fights. 'At this level in boxing you're fighting top five opponents and in Hammer the No 3 ranked WBO heavyweight in the world so nobody is going to be easy, they're all hard fights,' he added. 'You can say I'm in touching distance of a world title but in hindsight I may as well be five million miles away because I'm not fighting Klitschko, I'm not in the ring with him and that fight's not happening in my mind. 'Until I'm in the ring in the opposite corner it's not on so it's just another fight for me, another day in the office. I'm going to go in there and box, move around and win and get out of there.'

"A prison officer who smuggled drugs and alcohol into a jail for an inmate she fell in love with after having sex with him at work has been today jailed for a year. Hannah Stewart, 28, of Featherstone, Staffordshire, fell for Andrelle Leedham, 26, after they struck up a relationship at HMP Featherstone, near Wolverhampton. The pair met in the education department of the Category C jail where Leedham had a prison job as a cleaner before he wooed her with his ‘smooth-talk’ and charm, Stafford Crown Court was told. Criminals: Hannah Stewart (left), 28, of of Featherstone, Staffordshire, fell for Andrelle Leedham (right), 26, after they struck up a relationship at a jail - and they would meet up for secret sex sessions in a cupboard . They would meet up for secret sex sessions in a cleaning cupboard. Stewart even wrote love letters to her ‘gorgeous baby’ while he was in prison for blackmail, telling him: ‘I seriously love you.’ Leedham was released in August last year and convinced his new lover to smuggle a package into the jail three months later in November. But she was caught with the contraband - containing seven mobile phones, cannabis, anabolic steroids, whiskey and vodka - inside a sports bag in which she had carried her lunch. Stewart admitted conspiracy to smuggle drugs into the jail and misconduct in a public office. On Friday she was jailed for 12 months at Derby Crown Court. Sentencing, Recorder Peter Cookes said: ‘It is quite clear there was a degree of physical intimacy between the two of you when he was still a prisoner. ‘However, it is not necessary for me to decide what acts you were engaged in at that stage. Things accelerated thereafter and he devised a number of tactics to get you to do what he wanted. Jail: The pair met in the education department of HMP Featherstone (pictured), near Wolverhampton, where Leedham had a prison job as a cleaner before he wooed her with his 'smooth-talk' and charm . ‘I am alive to your compelling personal mitigation and the difficulties ex-prison officers face in the custodial environment. But the public would think I had taken leave of my senses if you were spared a term of immediate imprisonment.’ Her sentence was reduced because she gave vital evidence against the three men - including her ex-lover - who were also involved in the plot. Leedham, from Blakenhall, West Midlands, was jailed for four years on November 11 after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply drugs following a week-long trial. Prosecutor Gerard Quirke said: ‘She provided key evidence in this case.’ Leedham’s trial heard that on November 21 last year, Stewart picked up the contraband from the home of his mother before travelling to the prison for work the next day. Stewart hid the bag in a cupboard in the education department where she was passed a message from Leedham by inmate Christopher Lewis. The 38-year-old told her to wait and give the package to another inmate Ricardo Edwards, 31, who approached her shortly after and asked: ‘Is that for me?’ Edwards and Lewis were detained and the package was recovered, which was found to have Leedham’s fingerprints on. Inmate: Leedham (pictured), from Blakenhall, West Midlands, was jailed for four years on November 11 after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply drugs following a week-long trial . Edwards, who is serving an indeterminate sentence for robbery, and Lewis, who is in Featherstone for supplying heroin, each admitted conspiring to supply the drug. They were both jailed for two years and three months. Mark Nicholls, defending, said: ‘Giving evidence against the other defendants gave her a great deal of concern for safety reasons but she knew it was the right thing to do. ‘She was charmed by Leedham and made a significant mistake.’ Giving evidence, Stewart told the court how she had succumbed to Leedham’s charm and fell for the inmate before they broke up following a short fling. She said: ‘He made me feel good about myself. He told me I was attractive, that he would like to get to know me and one day would have me. ‘At first I just ignored him but he continued to say how beautiful I was, how he had feelings for me and wanted to be with me when he got out. ‘I believed him. I should have reported him but did not. I had started to like him. I wrote the letter to him the week before he was released and it accurately reflected my feelings towards him.’","Hannah Stewart, 28, fell for Andrelle Leedham, 26, at HMP Featherstone .

"A compound emitted by mould can be linked to the development of Parkinson's disease, researchers believe . A damp, mouldy house has long been known to trigger asthma and allergies - and new research has now linked it to an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. Scientists found a compound emitted by mould can be linked to the development of the neurological condition. The U.S. researchers found a connection between the compound given off by mould and mildew - a vapour known as 'mushroom alcohol'  – and the malfunctioning of two genes associated with the brain chemical dopamine. This is lost in patients with Parkinson's disease. While the condition has previously been linked to exposure to toxins, these were man-made rather than natural chemicals, said researcher Dr Arati Inamdar, from Rutgers University. The idea for the research came from the study's co-author Dr Joan Bennett, also from Rutgers University, who became interested in the health effects of living in a damp building after her house was flooded when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005. After her house flooded it became riddled with moulds and Dr Bennett started to collect samples wearing protective clothing. She said: ‘I felt horrible – headaches, dizziness, nausea. I knew something about “sick building syndrome” but until then I didn’t believe in it. ‘I didn’t think it would be possible to breathe in enough mould spores to get sick.’ As a result of this experience, Dr Bennett decided to investigate the connection between moulds and the symptoms she had experienced. She and Dr Inamdar discovered that the volatile organic compound 1-octen-3-ol, otherwise known as mushroom alcohol, can cause movement disorders in fruit flies. Researchers found a connection between a compound - popularly known as mushroom alcohol - and the malfunctioning of two genes involved in the packaging and transport of dopamine, the chemical released by nerve cells to send messages to other nerve cells in the brain. Image shows a scan of a brain with Parkinson's . They also found that it attacks the . two genes that deal with dopamine, degenerating the neurones and causing . Parkinson’s-like symptoms. Parkinson's . disease occurs when the nerve cells in the brain that make dopamine are . slowly destroyed. Without dopamine, the nerve cells in that part of the . brain cannot properly send messages. Parkinson's . disease occurs when the nerve cells in the brain that make dopamine are . slowly destroyed. Without dopamine, the nerve cells in that part of the . brain cannot properly send messages. It is a progressive disease of the nervous . system marked by tremor, muscular rigidity and slow, imprecise movement. Many people with Parkinson's also suffer from depression, daytime sleepiness and difficulty swallowing. There is no cure for the condition but there are some drug treatments which can be beneficial temporarily. About one in 500 people develop Parkinson's disease and there are currently 127,000 people in the UK with the condition. The average age for the symptoms to develop is about 60, although one in 20 cases first develop in people under the age of 50. Men are one and a half times more likely to get Parkinson's than women. White people are much more likely to get it than black and Asian people. Source: NHS Choices . Studies . indicate that the condition - a progressive disease of the nervous . system marked by tremor, muscular rigidity and slow, imprecise movement - . is increasing in rural areas, where it’s usually attributed to . pesticide exposure. But rural environments also have a lot of mould and mushroom exposure. ‘Our work suggests that 1-octen-3-ol might also be connected to the disease, particularly for people with a genetic susceptibility to it,’ Dr Inamdar said. ‘We’ve given the epidemiologists some new avenues to explore.’ Claire Bale, Research Communications Manager at Parkinson’s UK, said: ‘Understanding what causes Parkinson’s remains one of the big unanswered questions for researchers today. ‘We already know that exposure to some chemicals can slightly increase the risk of Parkinson's, and this is the first study to suggest that chemicals produced by fungi may play a part in what causes the condition to develop. ‘It is important to remember this study was conducted using tiny fruit flies, so before we can really be confident about this new connection we need to see evidence from studies in people. ‘Whilst exposure to chemicals produced by fungi – and possibly other chemicals – may play a role in Parkinson's in some people, it's likely just a small part of a much bigger puzzle and we wouldn’t want people to worry unnecessarily about developing the condition if they found mold or fungi in their homes. ‘We still don't know exactly what causes Parkinson's – for most people it's likely to be a combination of natural ageing, genetic susceptibility, lifestyle and environmental factors.’ The findings, which were produced with help from researchers at Emory University, were published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and the study was funded by Rutgers University and the National Institutes of Health.","Some mould emits a compound or vapour known as 'mushroom alcohol'

"Botox manufacturer Allergan has agreed to be bought by pharmaceutical giant Actavis for $66 billion following a six-month bidding war. The Los Angeles-based company fended off advances from hedge fund billionaire William Ackman and Canadian drug maker Valeant Pharmaceuticals in fear that neither would pump money into research and development. Allergan, founded in 1948 with an anti-allergy nose drop, acquired the rights to distribute botulinum toxin in 1989 and the wrinkle-freezing drug was approved for cosmetic use in 2002. Top-seller: Botox manufacturer Allergan has agreed to be bought by pharmaceutical giant Actavis for $66billion following a six-month long bidding war . In 2013 sales were shy of $2 billion, up 12per cent from 2012, which meant Botox represented more than a third of Allergan's total sales. Actavis, which is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland and New Jersey, said Monday that it will spend $219 in cash and stock for each share of Allergan. Its current CEO Brent Saunders will lead the combined company. Commenting on Monday's deal, David E. I. Pyott, chairman and CEO of Allergan, said in a release: 'Today's transaction provides Allergan stockholders with substantial and immediate value, as well as the opportunity to participate in the significant upside potential of the combined company.

"Covered in scars and bruises or held in a vice like grip by an unseen male, these are not the kind of profile pictures Tinder users are used to seeing. But the popular dating app has become the latest platform used to raise awareness of the growing problem of sex trafficking. The women pictured are in fact actresses who are posing as victims. Users are able to scroll through several shots of them before seeing a message which reveals the campaign behind the pictures. Tinder campaign: The fake profiles feature actresses posing as victims of sex trafficking in an attempt to raise awareness of the issue . Raising awareness: Each profile ends with a stark message 'Sex trafficking victims have no options. You have an option to help end it now' 'Your options are left or right,' the message reads, 'sex trafficking victims have no options. You have an option to help end it now.' 'Made up to work here, but too young to be there,' reads another profile featuring a heavily made-up adolescent looking girl. The campaign has been launched by Immigrant Council of Ireland and advertising agency eightytwenty to attempt to bring home the reality of modern day slavery. With human trafficking now the second largest criminal activity in the world, it is increasingly common in the West. The International Labour Organization estimates that there are over 1.5 million victims of forced labour in developed economies and the European Union. A recent Association of Chief Police Officers report found over 2,212 brothels just in London with an estimated 50 per cent of the women working in them believed to be victims of trafficking. One of the many profiles created for the campaign shows a women being held down by an unseen male . Speaking about the innovative campaign, Cathal Gillen of eightytwenty says: 'This is the first use of Tinder in Ireland for a campaign of this nature and one of the first globally. 'Tinder has become an extremely popular app in Ireland, and it provides us with a unique, innovative and stand out way of communicating to men the issues faced by women involved in sex trafficking' So far the organisation is reporting a good response to the large number of fake profiles they have set up. The NCA’s United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre (UKHTC) estimates that 2,744, people, including 602 children, were potential victims of trafficking for exploitation in 2013. This represented an increase of 22 per cent on 2012. The report lists the 10 most common countries of origin for victims, which shows Romania as the most prevalent country overall, and Poland as the most likely nation for labour trafficking. The number of British victims increased 124 per cent to 193, of whom three quarters had been trafficked around the country for sexual exploitation.","Fake profiles see actresses made up as sex trafficking victims .

"Top prosecutor Margaret Cunneen SC has slammed anti-corruption body ICAC for wanting a 'show trial' to investigate her for claims made in the aftermath of a car crash in May this year involving her son's girlfriend. Ms Cunneen's legal team, who are in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal today with the NSW deputy chief Crown prosecutor's latest  bid to halt the ICAC probe, say the hearing would be like a 'public flogging'. Ms Cunneen has taken her case before the state's Chief Justice Tom Bathurst, and justices John Basten and Julie Ward in a bid to reverse a decision last week by a Supreme Court judge. Justice Clifton Hoeben ruled on November 10 that an ICAC inquiry could proceed against Ms Cunneen, rejecting a bid by her, her son Stephen Wyllie and his girlfriend, Sophia Tilley. Margaret Cunneen SC (pictured) is in the Court of Criminal Appeal today to appeal against the ICAC inquiry, which she says would be a 'show trial' The inquiry sought to investigate an allegation that Ms Cunneen and Mr Wyllie coached Ms Tilley to fake chest pains in order to avoid a breath test following a car crash on May 31. Ms Cunneen had applied to the NSW Supreme Court to shut down the inquiry, arguing that the Independent Commission Against Corruption had no right to investigate a 'malicious' complaint which related to her private life. Ms Tilley was driving Ms Cunneen's Ford Mondeo when it was hit by another vehicle in Willoughby, on Sydney's north shore. The Mondeo was knocked onto its side and Ms Tilley was trapped for some time and experienced chest pain, fearing that her breast implants may have been ruptured. She telephoned Mr Wyllie and he and his father attended the scene. Ms Tilley was not at fault in the accident and a blood test conducted afterwards on her at Royal North Shore Hospital showed no alcohol in her system. However, the Independent Commission Against Corruption announced late last month that it was investigating Ms Cunneen, Ms Tilley and Mr Wyllie over a corruption allegation. Daily Mail Australia has revealed that ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident, on July 30. In August, Ms Cunneen faced a private hearing over the allegations. On October 29, Ms Cunneen, her son and Ms Tilley received a summons to attend a public inquiry into the matter, sparking their court bid to halt the proceedings. Scroll down for video .

"An apparent tornado touched down early Monday at a state prison near Blountstown in Florida's Panhandle, slightly injuring two people and damaging a number of vehicles. Calhoun County Sheriff Glenn Kimbrel says the workers were just arriving for their shifts early Monday at the Calhoun Correctional Institution and hadn't even gotten out of their vehicles when the storm struck around 4am CST. Kimbrel says there was 'major damage' to between 25 and 30 vehicles in the parking lot and some of the fencing around the prison's perimeter was knocked down.

"Just looking at a McDonalds sign, or any other symbols of our ‘culture of convenience’, makes us sad, according to new research. Canadian researchers claim being exposed to symbols of fast food and other signs of disposable society could make the smaller, everyday things in life harder to enjoy. The study found that people regularly exposed to fast food signs are less likely to savour enjoyable experiences, such as finding pleasure in art and music. Canadian researchers claim being exposed to symbols of fast food and other signs of disposable society could make the smaller, everyday things in life harder to enjoy. They singled out McDonalds as the 'ultimate symbol of time efficiency' Researchers from the University of Toronto picked the McDonalds symbol to examine, as they claim it has become the ‘ultimate symbol of time efficiency’ in the modern world. Student Julian House and professors Sanford E. DeVoe and Chen-Bo Zhong, from the university, told Psypost: ‘It is ironic that technologies designed to improve well-being by minimising time spent on mundane chores may ultimately undermine the surplus leisure time they permit. ‘By instigating a sense of impatience, these technologies may prevent people from savouring the enjoyable moments life offers serendipitously.' The research, published in journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, discovered that people who regularly see fast-food symbols, are not as likely to savour enjoyment in art and music. An examination of 280 participants in the U.S. found people while living in neighbourhoods packed with fast food outlets were less likely to savour enjoyable experiences. The study found that people living near fast food outlets had lesser emotional responses to enjoyable experiences, such as finding pleasure in art (pictured) and music . In another experiment, 250 people rated the suitability of five advertising images, three of which were ‘neutral’ and two showed McDonalds meals. Half of the survey participants saw food displayed in the McDonalds packaging, while the other half saw the same food on ceramic plates. Half of the participants were also shown scenes of natural beauty and all those who took part were asked to rate their happiness. The scientists found that people who looked at the pictures of natural beauty were happier than those who had not, but the effect was lost on those who had also looked at the McDonalds symbol as they reported being less happy than those people who had only looked at the scenery. Another 122 participants rated the same five images of food but some listened to 86 seconds of ‘The Flower Duet’ from opera Lakmé. Unhappy meal? Canadian researchers claim being exposed to symbols of fast food and other signs of disposable society could make the smaller, everyday things in life harder to enjoy . Those who had only listened to the music and seen the neutral food images thought the music had lasted longer than it did,, while those who had also seen the McDonalds food in its official packaging reported a less positive emotional response to the piece of music and were less patient. The researchers believe it is important to understand the influence of advertising symbols as they are so prevalent in our everyday environment. ‘As a ubiquitous symbol of an impatient culture, fast food not only impacts people’s physical health but may also shape their experience of happiness in unexpected ways,’ they said. However, they stressed the findings only examined a small sample of ‘early pleasures’ and that happiness does not simply rely on the savouring of experiences.","Canadian researchers said people who regularly see fast-food symbols, are not as likely to savour enjoyment of art and music .

"Thousands of paedophiles have rushed to use a new form from Google giving them the 'right to be forgotten' which lets people apply to get themselves removed from search results. The . changes come after a landmark ruling by the European Court of Justice that people have the . 'right to be forgotten' - so they can have Google search results removed if they tarnish their reputation. Over 12,000 people across Europe have used the form since Google launched the online form . yesterday morning. If those requests are granted, anyone searching for those people on Google will not be shown the aspects of their past that they have deemed to be embarrassing or damaging - making internet searches fundamentally less useful.

At one point Google said it was getting 20 requests per minute. But the . ruling has already been criticised after early indications that around . 12 per cent of applications were related to paedophilia. A further 30 per cent concern fraud . and 20 per cent were about people's arrests or convictions. Along with requests from paedophiles, many other applications have come from corrupt public figures and . criminals desperate to hide their past. An actor who had an affair with a teenager, a celebrity's child who was convicted of criminal offices and a man who . tried to kill members of his family were among the first requests. The company has set up a team of . employees to deal with requests and sift through applications from people desperate to . have personal information removed from search results. The team will decide exactly which grievances should be honoured under the European court ruling and which should not. However, the company said it will not honour every application and will look at each case based on its merit.

It means that Google now finds itself in the prickly position of having to balance privacy concerns against the principles of free expression and 'the right to know.' Critics say the EU ruling has already created a divide between how Google generates search results about some people in Europe and the rest of the world. For now at least, Google will only scrub personal information spanning 32-nations in Europe. It means that Googling the same person in the United States and dozens of other countries could look much different than it does from Europe. And although the court ruling currently applies to 28 countries in the European Union, Google is extending the 'right to be forgotten' to four other countries — Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.

"The scientist who discovered hepatitis C in 1989 says he has now created a vaccine against the liver-destroying virus. Michael Houghton, from the University of Alberta, said the vaccine was developed from a single strain but is effective against all known strains of the disease. Dr Houghton started working on the project 10 years ago while he was working for the drug company Novartis. Dr Houghton (left) discovered hepatitis C in 1989. This electron micrograph (right) shows hepatitis virions, which cause the virus . The disease has caused a 'silent epidemic' in western countries. Figures published yesterday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed more people died as a result of Hepatitis C than from Aids in the U.S in 2007. 'One of every 33 baby boomers are living with hepatitis C infection,' said CDC's Dr John Ward. Left untreated it can cause scarring of the liver and ultimately to life-threatening cirrhosis. The U.S figures revealed there were 15,000 deaths related to the condition in 2007 - three-quarters of whom were middle aged. The condition is unpredictable - while some may live with the condition their whole lives with only mild symptoms, others can develop serious liver disease even with treatment. Hepatitis literally means the inflammation of the liver. It is usually caused by a virus, although alcohol excess can also be to blame. The most common types of liver inflammation and infection are Hepatitis A, B and C... Hepatitis A is spread by eating contaminated food or drinking water. It's most common in countries with poor hygiene standards. There is a vaccine.Hepatitis B is usually passed on by exposure to infected blood. In developing countries it is mostly passed from mother to baby. In developed countries it's spread through sex and sharing drug needles. It is 100 times more infectious than HIV, yet there is a vaccine to prevent infection.Hepatitis C is also a ‘blood borne’ virus. It can be passed on through sexual contact but is most commonly shared through sharing drug needles. There is no vaccine.Most people recover from hepatitis A with no lasting liver damage but B and C can cause long term liver disease, leading to cirrhosis and even liver cancer. In many cases there are no early warning symptoms until liver damage is advanced. Source: The Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre . There is currently no vaccine in use to prevent infection in the first place. But, . speaking at the Canada Excellence Research Chairs Summit in Vancouver . yesterday, Dr Houghton revealed his team is just five years away from . creating a useable vaccine. Dr Houghton and his co-investigator John Law . discovered that they could use a single strain of the virus to draw out broad . cross-neutralising antibodies against all the different major strains. 'This tells us that a vaccine made from a single strain can indeed neutralize all the viruses out there,' he said. 'It really encourages the further . development of that vaccine. This is a really a big step forward for the . field of HCV vaccinology.' Hundreds of thousands of people are infected with hepatitis C annually around the world, with between 20 to 30 per cent developing some form liver disease. However, Dr Houghton cautions that further testing is required, meaning that it may be five to seven years before the vaccine receives approval. He added that while it may make some difference in those currently suffering from hepatitis C, the vaccine will mainly be a preventative measure against acquiring the disease. Lorne Tyrrell, director of the Li Ka Shing Institute at the University of Alberta, said: 'We have a long way to go, but this is a great step.'","Up to 30 per cent of hepatitis C sufferers develop liver disease .

For sale: Britain's oldest working post windmill has gone on the market for £900,000, complete with a three-bedroom house for anyone hoping to make some real dough . History: Grade I-listed Outwood Mill dates back to a year before the Great Fire of London, and is set in the grounds of the house in the Surrey village of Outwood . Still working: The 350-year-old mill stands 39ft high, with sails measuring 60ft across, and can still be operated by one person thanks to the remarkable craftsmanship that went into building it . The mill, which can still grind corn if required, and home are both on the market for £899,999 from Howard Cundey estate agents in Bletchingley, Surrey. 'The phrase gets banded around a lot, but this is genuinely a once in a lifetime opportunity to own a true slice of British history,' said spokesman Brett Chenery. 'Outwood Mill is one of the area’s most famous landmarks, now protected by a Grade I listing, and a fascinating piece of local history. 'It is not a dwelling, so technically it is Britain’s biggest garden ornament as well. Owning Britain’s oldest working windmill is definitely better than a garden gnome.' Ancient: Work to build the windmill began in 1665 on behalf of miller Thomas Budgen, an ancestor of the family who opened the Budgens supermarket chain . Protected: Outwood Mill is one of the area’s most famous landmarks and is now protected by a Grade I listing . Mechanics: Outwood Mill has four spring sails controlled by elliptical springs, carried on a wooden Windshaft with a cast iron poll end. The mill drives two pairs of millstones and is winded by tailpole . Work to build the windmill began in 1665 on behalf of miller Thomas Budgen, and its current owners used to run educational tours for schoolchildren and history buffs. Mr Chenery added: 'It would make a fantastic venue for weddings and antique fairs, and it’s definitely a good talking point. 'Keen bakers could even grind their own flour to make their own unique bread.' The sale includes the three-bedroom detached bungalow which offers 'spacious, open-plan living and a luxury fitted kitchen'. Home and away: The mill, which can still grind corn if required, and home are both on the market for £899,999 from Howard Cundey estate agents in Bletchingley, Surrey . All mod cons: The sale includes the three-bedroom detached bungalow which offers 'spacious, open-plan living and a luxury fitted kitchen' How it was: Outwood Mill, pictured in around 1903 . Outwood Windmill, a post mill on a single storey roundhouse, was built in 1665 for miller Thomas Budgen, who lived in the nearby village of Nutfield. He borrowed the money to buy the land and build the mill from his two brothers-in-law and as being a miller was such a lucrative trade, Budgen was able to pay back his financiers with interest in just two years. The men who built the mill are said to have watched the Great Fire of London glowing in the distance, some 25 miles away. In 1678, Budgen he was fined £20, worth around £1,700 in today's money, after he was convicted under the Convecticle Act for 'Seditious Preaching'. Budgen was an ancestor of another John Budgen, who set up the eponymous supermarket chain in 1872. He died, aged 75, in 1716, and the mill passed to his son John, and then to other family members, before it came into possession of the Jupp family by 1806. They ran it until 1962, when it was bought by brothers Gerald and Raymond Thomas. In 1796, William Budgen was given permission to put up a second windmill, this one a smock mill, which was run by the Budgen family until 1885 when Edward Scot bought the lease  for £1,225. In 1950, the preservation of the mill was proposed, but a survey later found it was suffering from rot and would cost too much to repair. The mill collapsed in the early hours of November 25, 1960. By the 1930s the original mill was little used, and although it had been recognised by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings in 1929 as being of 'paramount importance', it had started to fall into ruin with plans to restore it delayed by the outbreak of the Second World War. Extensive repairs were carried out in 1952, and in 1955 a grant of £750 from the Ministry of Works was provided the fund the fitting of a new pair of spring sales, on the condition that the public would be given access to the mill. On June 12, 1964, the mill was caught in a severe thunderstorm, and only saved when the new owners turned the mill so that the wind was side on to the building. The mill has four spring sails controlled by elliptical springs, carried on a wooden windshaft with a cast iron poll end. It drives two pairs of millstones, and is winded by tailpole.","Outwood Mill was built in the village of Outwood, Surrey, in 1665, a year before the Great Fire of London .

"A man has been left scarred for life after his stomach caught fire while on an operating table. Paul Hill, 43, from Stockton-on-Tees was burned after an alcohol-based body steriliser burst into flames while he was under general anaesthetic in an operating theatre at Stockton’s University Hospital of North Tees. The father-of-four is now awaiting answers from an internal investigation by hospital bosses into how the incident happened. Paul Hill, 43, has been left scarred for life after his stomach caught fire during an operation . It was only after his operation that Mr Hill was told the shocking news that his stomach had caught fire when a solution used to clean the skin ignited. He said: 'I didn’t even know it was possible. When they told me I didn’t know what to think. 'I had only just come around and told my wife what had happened. She didn’t believe me - thinking it was the drugs.' His wife Tracy, 42, added: 'He said to me ""I have been set on fire”. He was high on morphine so I didn’t believe him at first. 'But a nurse in the room said he was being serious. It was scary.' The operation during which the blaze happened came during a long-running battle with ill health. During the operation, some alcohol-based body steriliser caught fire and burned his stomach . Stockton's University Hospital of North Tees is now investigating how the accident happened . Mr Hill was diagnosed with familial adenomatous polyposis in November 2012. The inherited condition causes numerous polyps to form, mainly in the large intestine. These can develop into colon cancer if untreated. As a result, Mr Hill underwent surgery to remove part of his digestive system. A side effect of this is that hernias can develop and he had to have an operation on a hernia in February this year. Mr Hill said: 'I didn't even know it was possible. When they told me I didn't know what to think' But problems persisted and he went into hospital again on March 19, which is when the operating room fire occurred. The experience has also worried the couple's son McKenzie. The 11-year-old has been diagnosed with the same condition as his father and may face similar surgery in the future. 'He has seen me go through it all - all the surgeries and now this,' said Mr Hill, a clerical assistant at Morrisons. Mr Hill said: 'I just hope they learn from what happened to me cause it could have been fatal to someone else' The ordeal has left Mr Hill with scars on the right side of his stomach. He also requires a district nurse every day to change his bandages. 'I just think what more can you take,' said Mrs Hill. 'You get through one thing, then there is something else.' Mr Hill added: 'I just hope they learn from what has happened to me because it could have been fatal. A spokesperson for North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We take incidents like this extremely seriously. A thorough investigation into what happened and what can be put in place to prevent this happening again has almost been concluded.'","Paul Hill had an operation at Stockton’s University Hospital of North Tees .

"A London-based architect has been making waves in the design industry with her vision of a stunning home powered by hydroelectricity. Margot Krasojevic's concept, Hydroelectric Tidal House, aims to harness the consistent and powerful movement of waves to generate energy. Ms Krasojevic is an avid supporter of renewable energy - previously designing an electric coral reef station and a hydroelectric prison. A London-based architect has been making waves in the design industry with her design of a stunning home powered by hydroelectricity. Margot Krasojevic's concept, Hydroelectric Tidal House, aims to harness the consistent and powerful movement of waves to generate energy . She explained that the construction will be focused around two shells - one inner and one outer. Made of concrete, the outer shell is designed to keep the house stable and will use solar cells to generate energy for the living section. The inner section, which will be made of aluminium, will move in cohesion with the tide. The section will float within the external structure as the tide rushes through it. As tides are more predictable than solar energy, Ms Krasojevic has included a two-part turbine, which, reacting with waves, will compress air to create an electrical current - similar to a wind turbine. The designer explained that the construction will be focused around two shells - one inner and one outer. Made of concrete, the outer shell is designed to keep the house stable and will use solar cells to generate energy for the living section . As tides are more predictable than solar energy, Ms Krasojevic has also included a two-part turbine (left), which, reacting with waves, will compress air to create an electrical current - similar to a wind turbine . Ms Krasojevic, 39, said: 'Designers approached me to design a surfers' beach house, which made me think of tidal power and using this dynamic in a similar way to how surfers choreograph movement through water.' Pictured is the exterior staircase of the home . The second part of the turbine uses magnets that move along a copper wire, also generating electrical energy. Ms Krasojevic, 39, said: 'The hydroelectric house is the latest in my design approach, attempting to harness renewable energy within sustainable design. 'Designers approached me to design a surfers' beach house, which made me think of tidal power and using this dynamic in a similar way to how surfers choreograph movement through water. Coral reefs are known as the ‘rainforests of the sea’ and although they only occupy a total area half the size of France, they provide a home for a quarter of all marine species on the planet. Now Margot Krasojevic has shared designs for a futuristic manmade reef with an electric field designed to attract calcium carbonate from the water in a bid to form new reefs quickly. In her vision, the reef would be formed from a framework of moveable steel girders and steel ball structures, designed in a way to support the growth of natural coral. Large ‘metal balls’ would be connected by cables to floating solar panels on the water’s surface so an electrical current can be generated.The current would draw particles of calcium to small pieces of natural coral attached to steel frames below the water, in a bid to stimulate further growth. It would be low enough for divers to swim around the structure - which looks as it if comes from a sci-fi film – but strong enough to create an electric field around the frame. The field would condense dissolved calcium carbonate in the seawater so that it could attach itself to the steel frame in order to build the limestone skeleton. And the coral fragments tied to the calcium carbonate-covered frame would help limestone skeleton growth, which is the foundation for natural corals. The inner section, which will be made of aluminium, will move in cohesion with the tide. That movement will run a turbine which will then generate electricity for living . Ms Krasojevic is a supporter of renewable energy - previously designing an electric coral reef station and a hydroelectric prison. Pictured is her latest designs . 'I believe it is vital for architects to work with cross disciplines - in particular, planning infrastructure and sustainability' Earlier this year, Ms Krasojevic unveiled a design for champagne bar that will be the toast of Paris if it is built before the French capital is threatened by another flood. Located on the banks of the Seine, the ultramodern structure – dubbed Grand Cru du Siecle – would have an enclosed circular glass bar situated over a bell mouth spillway that swallows water and sends it into underground canals. According to Ms Krasojevic's splashy proposal, the water is then diverted into outlying lakes and reservoirs. As for the bar itself, it features a monocoque shell that welcomes natural light and etched glass like that of a bottle of bubbly. The second part of the turbine (right) uses magnets that move along a copper wire, also generating electrical energy. The architect's designs are still at concept stage .

"President Obama has been judged to be 'chronically incapable' of conducting a coherent military strategy and 'has no sense of what he wants to do in the world', according to Oxford University professor, Sir Hew Strachan - one of the UK's most respected and senior military advisers. The damning verdict from a governmental insider of the United States' closest military ally comes days after the president was heavily criticized by his own former Defense Secretary Robert Gates who said that Obama was indecisive and lacked any passion for his nation's armed forces. Claiming that America and Britain had committed total strategic failure in their near decade-long Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns, Strachan said that the recent failed attempts to intervene militarily on behalf of Syrian rebels 'has left them in a far worse position than they were before.' Scroll down for video . U.S. President Barack Obama applauds retiring Defense Secretary Robert Gibbs in 2011 - Gibbs has lambasted his former boss in his new memoir and called him indecisive and far from passionate about the military . Strachan is currently a member of the United Kingdom's Chief of Defence Staff's Strategic Advisory Panel and claims that the 'crazy' mismanagement of the Syrian crisis at the end of the summer was the worst example of the military planning in evidence since 9/11 and that at least President George W. Bush had a plan and stuck to it. Stern views: Professor Sir Hew Strachan of Oxford University has been sharply critical of the United States, President Obama and Britain's strategic planning since 9/11 in his new book The Direction of War . 'If anything it’s gone backwards instead of forwards, Obama seems to be almost chronically incapable of doing this,' said Strachan. 'Bush may have had totally fanciful political objectives in terms of trying to fight a global War on Terror, which was inherently astrategic, but at least he had a clear sense of what he wanted to do in the world. 'Obama has no sense of what he wants to do in the world,' he said according to the Daily Beast. Even worse still, Strachan believes that Western indecision over whether or not to launch limited action against President Bashar al-Assad strengthened the Syrian leader and undermined the United States' power and reputation. 'What he’s done in talking about Red Lines in relation to Syria has actually devalued the deterrent effect of American military capability and it seems to me that creates an unstable situation, because if he were act it would surprise everybody,' he said. 'I think the other issue is that in starting and stopping with Assad, he’s left those who might be his natural allies in Syria with nowhere to go. He’s increased the likelihood that if there is a change of regime in Syria that it will be an Islamic fundamentalist one.' The verdicts reached by Strachan are published in his new book, The Direction of War, which is to be released next month. Critical: Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates was fiercely critical of President Obama in his new memoir . Decisive: U.S. President George W. Bush declares an end to major combat in Iraq during a speech to crew aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln as the carrier steamed toward San Diego, California, in this May 1, 2003 file photo . Dithering: United States President Barack Obama meets with members of his national security team in the Situation Room of the White House . Former Defense Secretary Robert . Gates has been forced to wear a neck brace while on his book launch . after breaking his first vertebrae after a fall. Mr . Gates, former Central Intelligence Agency director for President George . H.W. Bush and President Obama, fractured his neck after slipping on ice . outside his home in Seattle at the beginning of the year. In 2008, Mr Gates broke his shoulder after slipping on ice, causing him to miss a congressional hearing. The book examines what Strachan sees as the failure of politicians to use history and strategy to predict the implications of present or future military actions. Strachan, who is Oxford University's Professor of the History of War claims that politicians and the public have become used to quick-fix wars that are essentially an extension of policy. 'Using war did deliver. The wars were pretty short, the Falklands, First Gulf War, Kosovo, so people lulled themselves into an expectation that war was simply a continuation of policy and that it was successful. But it hasn’t been since 9/11,' he said. Strachan believes that civilian politicians have become too controlling of their military staff and leaders and do not allow them to give honest advice. No action: Aleppo, Syria --- Residents search for survivors after what activists said were air strikes by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in the Maysar neighbourhood of Aleppo December 28, 2013 . He is particularly critical of the sacking of General Stanley McCrystal after he seemed to be disparaging about his commander-in-chief in a Rolling Stone article. 'The concern about the military speaking out shows a lack of democratic and political maturity. We’re not facing the danger of a military coup. 'The professional experts, who deal with war all the time, should be able to express their views all the time, openly and coherently, just as you would expect a doctor or a teacher to express their views coherently about how you run medical policy or teaching policy,' he said. Strachan does not keep his criticisms solely to President Obama. Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron speaks in the House of Commons - where he lost a crucial vote in August to take the UK to war against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria . He says that British Prime Minster David Cameron's defeat in a parliamentary vote to launch military action on Syria 'absolutely illustrated the failure to think through the strategic implications of his own actions,' said Strachan. Indeed, Strachan calls to mind the example of British wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill, a former soldier himself, who enjoyed frank and open discussions with his military staff. 'Soldiers have a duty here as well—if they just say, ‘yes Mr. Prime Minister or Mr. President, we can give you exactly what you want,’ then they’re probably not being very honest.'","Sir Hew Strachan, an advisor to the UK's Chief of the Defence Staff has heavily criticized President Obama .

"More bungalows should be built for older people to free up bigger homes for families, the new housing minister has declared. The move would allow couples still living in large properties after their children have left home to downsize without being forced into a ‘retirement home’ or apartment. And it would put more large homes on the market for couples with children who need the extra space. Scroll down for video . Rare sight: Just 300 new bungalows were built in 2009, the most recent year for which figures are available, and housing minister Brandon Lewis has said that should increase. Pictured: New builds in Mill Hill, London . Brandon Lewis, who was appointed Minister of State for Housing and Planning in last month’s reshuffle, is urging developers to build more ‘quintessentially British’ bungalows. In recent years there has been a dramatic drop in the construction of bungalows – partly because builders see larger properties as being more profitable. Mr Lewis, the Tory MP for Great Yarmouth, said his own family provided a good example of the national need for bungalow building. He said: ‘My in-laws are in their 70s, pretty fit, mentally really with it; they live in a normal house which they both struggle with. 'They are not ready to move into what they would see as a retirement home, but where they live there is not access to bungalows. ‘We should be looking to love bungalows a little bit more. They are an important part of the mix, particularly if we do say to people like my in-laws, “look, there is somewhere you can move to which is ideal for you without having to go into what you might see as a retirement home.” Housing minister Brandon Lewis, pictured, said: 'We should be looking to love bungalows a little bit more' Speaking in an interview, he added: ‘In some areas on the outskirts of London you have tons and tons of apartments being built and not enough houses, because not everyone wants to live in an apartment.’ Earlier this year the Government amended guidelines to require council planners in England to set aside a certain number of flats or bungalows for older people. The move has been prompted by the demands of an ageing population. By 2021 the number of households is on course to increase by 2.2million. Of that, 1.2million are expected to be households aged 65 years and over. Currently only 2 per cent of homes in England are bungalows and in 2009 – the most recent available figures – only 300 bungalows were built. Last year the think tank Policy Exchange urged reform of the planning system to encourage developers to build more bungalows which would be attractive to older people. It estimated there were 25million spare bedrooms among the older population and this is in part due to lack of available bungalows. Planning rules which forced developers to build at least 30 dwellings per hectare acted as a disincentive towards new bungalows. The Policy Exchange report stated: ‘It makes no sense to prevent construction of bungalows if we are interested in increasing the housing supply and a more efficient use of the existing housing stock.’ However, other property experts believe custom-built apartments have replaced the bungalow as the retirement property of choice. Last week Mr Lewis unveiled a £200million fund to build thousands of new homes on brownfield sites in towns and cities. He said that this could protect greenfield areas from development. However, the threat of greenfield development remains. Mr Lewis said that it was important to ‘realise just how much open space we have got,’ although it was local councils who decided on the location of development.","Empty-nesters 'should be able to downsize without being forced into flats'

"There's barely enough room to bend down and pick up a cat, let alone swing it.

It also manages to cram in two reception rooms, a fitted kitchen and a garden overlooking the rural parish of Carn Brea. Lisa Chirtwin, whose family have owned the Cornish dwelling for 30 years, insists it’s not quite as small as it looks thanks to an L-shaped extension that was put up in 1991. She said: ‘It was built in 1917 and was used as servants’ quarters. ‘There were bells in the house when it came to our ownership 30 years ago but they were taken out when it was renovated.’ The owner said: 'It’s quite a light and airy home but cosy at the same time' She added: ‘The house was extended in 1991 to an L-shaped layout at the back so it is actually quite a big property.’ A spokesman for Miller Countrywide said the property was great value for money. Sally Johns said: ‘It’s quite a light and airy home but cosy at the same time. It has lovely views of Carn Brea. ‘The front aspect of the property is very deceptive and when you step in it leads to a widespread living area. ‘It is rare for us to come across a property like this, or one designed in this way, because many of the homes we sell have been kept as one property or split in two equal-sized homes.’","The tiny dwelling in Redruth, Cornwall, has gone on sale for £119,950 .

"Tide turn? Experts claim the market will mellow after 12 months as the number of houses for sale exceeds the number buyers . Britain's house-price boom threatens to turn into a property crash within months, warn industry experts, as a key survery is set to reveal there are now more sellers that buyers. House prices have soared in the past year, especially in London. But a survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) is this week expected to indicate that the numbers of houses on the market now exceeds the number of buyers. Prices are likely to rise for a further 12 months, but RICS expects them to fall after that. The Nationwide building society says properties in London are now 26 per cent dearer than they were a year ago and price rises have been seen across much of the country. But there has been mounting evidence that the surge has come to an end. Sellers are looking to cash in on high prices, creating a glut of homes for sale. Buyers, meanwhile, are said to be wary of paying huge prices for London properties in particular. With a rise in interest rates expected before the end of the year, some have argued now is  a bad time to be buying property, and that once the cost of mortgages goes up, prices will have to come down. The last time RICS published its figures, buyers were still outnumbering available stock, indicating that house prices across the country would continue to grow. But the number has been falling sharply in recent months, prompting speculation that it could head into negative territory when RICS releases figures for July on Thursday. The regional figures for London indicate that the number  of new sellers already hugely outnumbers new buyers. House-price growth has slowed in the capital in recent months, with estate agents talking of prices having reached a plateau. Figures from estate agency chain LSL Property Services show that home sales across the country are starting to pick up. Reining in: Mark Carney restricted the amount of lending banks could do to rein in the mortgage market . Property transactions have been stuck at low levels for several years, exacerbating  a shortage in the supply of homes. David Newnes, director of LSL’s Your Move estate agency chain, said: ‘Overall, 90,000 properties were sold across England and Wales in July,  up 21 per cent on a year previously and representing the highest monthly total since November 2007.’ The Bank of England earlier this year also acted to rein in excesses in the mortgage market, restricting the amount of lending banks could do  at high multiples of an applicant’s salary. But the rules are unlikely to restrict lending significantly unless prices soar and salaries stay where they are. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said when the changes were announced: ‘These actions should not restrain current market housing activity. These actions will have minimal impact in the future if the housing market evolves in line with the Bank’s central view.’","House prices have soared in London and across Britain over the past year .

"It’s been a long time coming but  Ashford Castle, one of Ireland’s oldest and best-loved castles has been renovated and reopened to the public. Of its eighty two rooms and suites which overlook the sprawling wooded 350-acre estate and Lough Corrib – Ireland’s second largest lake – 30 have been redone this year. Huge restoration work has been underway including the intricate overhaul of the building’s infrastructure, including stonework, windows and roofs, as well as modern updates like air conditioning and WiFi. Stately pile: Ashford castle has a 350 acre private estate and sits picturesquely back from Lough Corrib, Ireland’s second largest lake . The remaining 52 rooms will be given a face lift between January and March 2015 when the medieval castle is closed for winter. Additions will include a private theatre, a cigar room and a spa extension. But, for now, you could do an awful lot worse than visit the spectacularly turreted fortress which sits 35 miles northeast of Galway in County Mayo. The original property was founded by the Anglo-Norman de Burgo family in 1228 and has a guestbook which reads like a  who’s who. A cosmos of stars such as John Wayne and Maureen O’Hara (who stayed in rooms 408 and 500 - the only turret rooms in the castle), England’s King George V, US President Ronald Reagan and Beatles star John Lennon have checked in over the years. For €134 (£105) you can stay in their most basic Corrib standard rooms for one night but stretch to €12,118 (£9,510) and you’ll get three nights (minimum stay) in the recently restored master suite which includes the best views in the house, a sitting room area, writing desk, trouser press and sherry decanter. Eat like kings: 11  Waterford crystal chandeliers adorn the George V dining room where you can order a five- or seven- course tasting menu of locally sourced ingredients . In the nick of time: the five star hotel castle was bought in May last year by Red Carnation Hotels who paid €20 million for the struggling property . Choose a stateroom from €285 (£224) a night and you'll sleep in some of the oldest sections of the castle dating back to the 13th and 17th centuries. Most Staterooms contain traditional four-poster beds and feature original fireplaces with antique furniture. The hotel emerged, battle-weary, from receivership in May last year after Red Carnation Hotels paid €20 million for the Co Mayo resort and helped secure its future. Since then they've invested great swathes of cash into its upheaval and the renovation of public rooms and gardens. Opulent: a Victorian Lakeview Deluxe room. Stars such as John Wayne, Maureen O’Hara, George V and US President Ronald Reagan have checked in over the years . Room for two: choose a stateroom from €285 (£224) a night and you'll sleep in some of the oldest sections of the castle dating back to the 13th and 17th centuries . A hub of activity, once there, guests can go water-skiing, take part in archery or clay pigeon shooting, play on the golf course, fish in the lough or ride horses along the coast line. Best of all, the castle has a falconry school where you can learn to fly a Harris hawk around the grounds with a raptor expert by your side, or meet Dingle the resident owl. A visit to the opulent newly refurbished George V dining room is a must. Sit beneath 11 huge Waterford crystal chandeliers and choose to make your way through the five star castle’s five- or seven- course tasting menus of locally sourced lamb, fish, and shellfish and meat carving trolley. There’s also an extensive wine menu of exclusive wines from the new owner’s South African winery. What a catch! Once there guests can take their pick of activities including fishing,  water-skiing, archery, clay pigeon shooting or horse riding . As you might expect, there's  a spa where visitors can take their pick of aroma stone body massages or a toning body polishes using Guerande sea salt grains, amongst others. One of the most charming things about the fort, which is steeped in history and was owned for 90 years by the Guinness family, is its longevity. That’s no more so true than with its staff. 40 per cent have been there for 20 or more years and 55 per cent have 15-plus years’ service under their belt, with the majority living in Cong or nearby villages.

"The number of families losing their home to repossession is at the lowest level in eight years as people benefit from low interest rates and strong job growth. Properties taken back by banks and building societies in the first half of this year dropped to 11,800, the smallest number since 2006, figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) found. There was also a fall of 23,500 in the number of owners with arrears of 2.5 per cent or more of their balance, taking the figure down to 131,400, which is the lowest level for six years. Positive signs: The number of families losing their home to repossession is at the lowest level in eight years as people benefit from low interest rates and strong job growth . The news will add to growing feel-good factor around the economy and family finances with evidence people are finding it easier to juggle their must pay bills. Figures published earlier this week showed positive news on jobs with unemployment down to its lowest level since 2008. Home buyers have also been given an assurance from the Bank of England that there is no likelihood of any increase in interest rates from the current historic low of 0.5per cent until next year at the earliest. While mortgage holders will welcome that news, there is evidence that many young people are taking on supersize loans to get the keys to their first home and they will be particularly vulnerable when interest rates do go up. The CML director general, Paul Smee, said buyers do need to ensure that their finances can cope with a rise in mortgage repayments when they do come. Risk: There is evidence that many young people are taking on supersize loans to get the keys to their first home and they will be particularly vulnerable when interest rates do go up . He said: ‘Another fall in arrears and possessions is clearly welcome and shows that borrowers, lenders and money advisers are generally continuing to work well to contain payment problems where they arise, helped by an improving economy and low interest rates. But rates will rise at some stage, of course, and borrowers should be planning for that now. ‘We welcome the message from the Bank of England that, when it raises rates, it plans to do so in a series of ‘baby steps’, matched to a careful assessment of the ability of households to deal with higher borrowing costs. ‘Any borrower anticipating payment problems should talk to their lender as soon as possible. Today’s figures continue to show that in many cases it is possible to work through a period of difficulty, with lenders committed to helping borrowers get their finances back on track.’ Earlier this week, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, suggested house price rises will fall back next year. Recent surveys put the current increase at more than 10per cent a year, however Mr Carney believes the figure will be closer to six per cent in 2015. Due to fall: Earlier this week, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, suggested house price rises will fall back next year . He said: ‘Another fall in arrears and possessions is clearly welcome and shows that borrowers, lenders and money advisers are generally continuing to work well to contain payment problems where they arise, helped by an improving economy and low interest rates. But rates will rise at some stage, of course, and borrowers should be planning for that now. The Bank suggests that new mortgage affordability tests coupled with restrictions on the size of loans allowed will see a reduction in new mortgage approvals, taking some heat out of the market. A survey published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors yesterday(thrs) reported that the number of people looking new homes has fallen back for the first time in 18 months. An overall balance of five per cent of surveyors reported demand for homes falling rather than increasing in July, marking the first net decline in buyers coming to the market seen since January 2013. London surveyors have the lowest expectations in the UK for house price growth over the next 12 months, typically putting the percentage increase at 1.9per cent. Higher increases are expected in East Anglia, as well as Wales and Scotland. Property economist, Matthew Pointon, of Capital Economics, said: ‘The economy is growing at a robust pace and the labour market data showed that the unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest since December 2008. But weak pay growth and cautious lender behaviour will help bring house price inflation down to a more sustainable rate over the remainder of the year.’","Number of repossessed properties in first half of 2014 falls to 11,800 .

"A one-bedroom flat with just one year left on its lease has sold for an astonishing £550,000. The property in London's Knightsbridge was down to the final 12 months of a 90-year-lease when its owner died recently. A flurry of interest saw initial offers of around £150,000 soar, with the new owner now having to try and negotiate a new lease, which could cost a further £2million. Scroll down for video . A one-bedroom flat with just one year left on its lease has been sold for more than £500,000 in Knightsbridge . The property previously had a 90-year lease which had not been renewed by the owner before they died recently . At 1,012 sq/ft, it comprises a large living room with balcony, bathroom, kitchen and double bedroom. But the new owners will have to spend another £2million if they want to purchase another 90-year-lease with freeholders The Wellcome Trust. Nicholas Spencer, senior sales negotiator at Henry & James, described the sale as 'very rare' and fascinating'. He said: 'Theoretically, every leasehold flat could be in this situation, however it is very rare that it happens and is becoming more unlikely by the day. 'People simply do not let their lease run this short. 'The sale of this flat demonstrated the perfect storm. It was a long lease that had run down to its last year, an eye watering extension premium, the freeholder’s right to serve notice for possession and the tragic and unexpected death of the owner, intestate. 'The flat itself is perfect. It is a prime location, first floor, unmodernised property with beautiful proportions and outside space. Flats in the area of the same size typically sell for around £3million, according to estate agents Henry & James . The 1,012 square/ft flat is a 'rare sale' say experts as so few people allow their lease to run so short .

While Mr Spencer would not reveal any details about the new owner, it is thought they were aware of the investment potential for the flat when the sale was made. Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property expert, added: 'I haven’t come across a house selling with one year left on the lease.

"Perched quietly on top of a hill overlooking the Channel, it is what the late Alan Whicker, the veteran broadcaster and TV presenter described as 'my island paradise'. Now, a year after the journalist's death, his secluded Jersey home has gone on sale for £4.95million. Nestled among pine trees at the top of a winding driveway, the four-bedroom Mont d'Olivet is where Whicker found peace after a lifetime of globe-trotting. Scroll down for video . Alan Whicker's beloved Jersey home, Mont d'Olivet, has gone on the market for £4.95million. The property has four bedrooms and a heated outdoor swimming pool . The house is one of the most secluded on Jersey with three acres of tall pine trees hiding it from view in the nearby valley. Whicker bought the property in 1962 . Alan . Whicker's study where he worked on countless scripts and ideas for his . travel documentary series, Whicker's World, which ran for more than 30 . years . With sweeping views towards the Cherbourg peninsula, the 1950s property is described as one of the most secluded in Trinity, Jersey. Bought in 1972 by Whicker and his long-term partner, Valerie Kleeman, it was the couple's home until his death last July at the age of 91. Lush gardens and a tear-drop shaped heated pool are among the property's most coveted features, but it's unrivaled views across the water towards France is what held the TV presenter's life-long adoration. 'He had always been desperate to live near water,' said Ms Kleeman, with whom Whicker shared his life since 1969. 'One of his first childhood memories was of a holiday to Ullswater and he had taken a boat out at dawn. He was around seven or eight-years-old and had been totally enchanted with it. 'It stayed with him his whole life'. Panoramic views of the Channel towards the Cherbourg peninsula  are what captured the journalist's affection after searching for a home that overlooked  water . A gate on the property features the journalist's initials in clad iron on top of a globe. Despite travelling the world for his documentary series, Whicker 'loved coming home' to Mont d'Olivet . Alan Whicker was a British broadcaster and TV presenter whose documentary series, Whicker's World, ran for more 30 years. He is pictured with his partner Valerie Kleeman (right) receiving a CBE in the 2005 New Year Honours list . Set among three acres of woodland, the house is so secluded that only in winter when the trees are bare can its gables be seen from the nearby valley. Alan Whicker served with the British Army in Italy in World War II and later became a war correspondent. He joined the BBC in 1957 with the Tonight program, but soon after launched his Whicker's World series, which made him a household name. Whicker's World, a documentary program that ran from 1959 to 1990, showed the broadcaster travelling the globe, probing the private worlds of the rich and famous. He was also the man behind the popular advertising slogan Hello World for Travelocity. The presenter was given the Richard Dimbleby Award at the 1978 Baftas for his contribution to broadcasting and became a CBE in the 2005 New Year Honours list. The quietness the house and island became the perfect refuge for Whicker during a 60-year-career in broadcasting and entertainment. 'The fact that Jersey was away from England but close to England was what appealed to us, the communications were and are so good,' said Ms Kleeman. 'Alan was a news junkie so it was important for him to have English newspapers early in the morning and to have the TV channels too. 'He also felt that if he was too close to London he would always be drawn back to it. He wanted to be in the country but needed to be to be close enough to London. 'He loved this house, he loved this garden and felt very peaceful here. He loved to travel but this was where he loved to come home to.' Its three reception rooms and hallways are scattered with photographs of Whicker's illustrious career, including happy portraits of the journalist with Sean Connery, Dudley Moore and Peter Sellers to name a few. A paved sun terrace leads on to manicured lawns before rows of pine trees. A large study with a plush judge's chair is where he worked tirelessly on a plethora of programmes and scripts, including those for travel his documentary series, Whicker's World. 'This place is full of wildlife, I have about 20 red squirrels that I've been feeding for 20 years,' adds Ms Kleeman. 'It really is quite a remarkable place.' 'It became his haven, a place to write and edit Whicker’s World without having to travel further than a flight of stairs, a far cry from the first home of Yorkshire Television, an old shirt factory in Leeds. And he could relax. 'In his study with its wide windows overlooking the garden he could work till all hours every day of the week, distracted only by a sparkling invitation from the pool or the crackling of a log fire upstairs. 'Mont d’Olivet brought happiness and contentment to a man who had been set in his airways.  Hopefully, the next owners will find peace here too.'","Veteran broadcaster and TV presenter's  Channel Islands home has been put on sale for £4.95million .

"While small studio flats are nothing new in London, the rise of 'semi studios' has seen renters in the capital move into 'rabbit hutch properties' that are barely bigger than the legal minimum. Tiny bedsits on the market for up to £1,040 a month are becoming more common as landlords divide up larger houses and flats to take advantage of the London's booming housing market. Letting agents have dubbed these 'semi studios', and some are being let for nearly twice the average rent for a one bed flat. This £1,040-a-month 'semi studio' flat in West Kensington has a ladder to climb to its mezzanine-style bed . Labour's housing spokesman on the London Assembly said renters were living in 'rabbit hutch properties' Letting agents price this studio flat at £115 a person a week, but this bedroom is unlikely to fit more than one . By law, a studio flat has to be at least 70 sq ft to house one tenant, while two adults have to be afforded 110 sq ft of living space. Some of these minuscule studios have such little space that they share toilets with their neighbours, but they are still described as 'charming and compact' by letting agents. The most expensive of these flats, in West Kensington, costs £1,040 a month, but it's 'mezzanine-style' bed means its future tenant will have to climb a ladder to go to bed. The bed is so close to the ceiling that they will have to crawl on the bed to get under the sheets. Another of these flats, a £540-a-month bedsit in Pimlico, central London, is described as 'delightful' but with a 'compact' work space by letting agents. Its 'very own shower room' is actually a cubicle squeezed in between a table and the kitchen worktop, standing about 3ft from the studio's single bed. A further semi studio, in West Kensington, will set its tenant back almost £500 a month, despite not having its own toilet and having a shower cubicle crammed between a wardrobe and a window. Tom Copley, Labour's housing spokesman on the London Assembly, told the Guardian that Londoners were increasingly being forced to pay 'extortionate rents for poor quality, rabbit hutch properties'. He added: 'The home is at the centre of most people's lives, so the impact on quality of life is enormous. People ought to be able to expect a decent place to live for a reasonable rent.' Property website Zoopla say the average the one-bedroom property in London sets renters back £377 a week, while four-bedroom homes are advertised for an average £1,085 a week. This flat costs £477 per calendar month, but at least it comes with a toilet - unlike many semi studios . Showering with guests round, if they can fit any, will not be a comfortable experience for the future tenant of this 'delightful' semi studio in Pimlico, near Westminster . This single bed semi studio, on Edith Road in West Kensington, will set a tenant back £498 a month . This means landlords can make hundreds of pounds more in rent every week by dividing up family homes into the small studios. Platinum Property Partners, a buy-to-let mortgage lender, said recently that landlords could make up to £38,000 in annual rental income by splitting a family home into flats, compared to around £18,000 if they did not. Roger Harding, director of communications, policy and campaigns at Shelter, said: 'The fact that London's renters are stuck with these pitiful pint-sized properties is a reflection of the appalling state of our private rented sector. 'Sky high rents and tough competition for homes in the capital means that many renters have no choice but to take the first place they can afford, and are being squeezed into costly, cramped and claustrophobic flats that are far too small for them and their families.' This plain bedroom, labelled 'charming' by letting agents, costs £460 a month and does not have its own toilet . This narrow single-bed studio costs £480 a month, but is just a short walk from Earls Court Station .","Family homes split into multiple 'semi studio' flats as house market booms .

"This three-bedroom property in Clerkenwell, now on the market at £3 million, comes with its own little piece of gastronomic history. It's where Jamie Oliver first launched his TV career in the original series of The Naked Chef. If you cast your mind back to 1999 you might remember the spiral staircase which featured in the opening credits, the cobbled street on which Jamie parked his moped, and the kitchen where he’d whip up his unique brand of ‘pukka tukka’.

"Building a house from scratch, even a tiny one, is not for the faint of heart, but 14-year-old Sicily Kolbeck has proven she has what it takes to see her passion project through against overwhelming odds. Kolbeck, from Marietta, Georgia, started work on her diminutive dwelling, lovingly dubbed La Petite Maison, when she was 12. At the time, the girl was searching for an outside-the-box idea for a school project when she stumbled upon a sizable online community of DIY builders specializing in downsized homes. Scroll down for video . Welcome home: This is 14-year-old Sicily Kolbeck's finished 128-sqaure-foot home, complete with a bedroom, kitchen and bathroom . Labor of love: Sicily started work on her building project with her father when she was 12, but took a break after her dad's untimely passing last February . Sicily had no construction experience beyond re-purposing a large TV box as a playhouse for herself, but her father, Dane, volunteered to help, CNN reported. Her mother, Suzannah Kolbeck, who was also her teacher and the founder of her school, signed up as Sicily's project manager, but the girl was to act as the chief architect, builder and fundraiser on the project. Sicily got the project off the ground by launching an online fundraising campaign in January 2013. Within less than a month, the middle-schooler reached - and then exceeded - her $1,500 goal. 'My decision to build a tiny house was partly economic, partly the desire to be free,' Sicily Kolbeck wrote in the description. 'Building a tiny house can give me stability, possibly for the rest of my life if I build the house well. Tough guy: Dane Kolbeck, pictured left with his daughter, was a sailor by trade and a woodworking enthusiast . Special helper: While Sicily was the main architect and builder, her father assisted her with blueprints and power tools . 'Building a house would give me the life skills that really matter, such as using tools for construction. Building the house I can know what labors go into a home and truly appreciate what I am living in.' Around the same time, Sicily launched the blog La Petite Maison to offer updates on her progress. The . 12-year-old and her father, a sailor and woodworking enthusiast, got . down to work, drawing blueprints for her future dwelling and erecting . a birdhouse and scale models for practice. After . some initial growing pains, the father-and-team team got the hang of . working together, with Dane Kolbeck learning how to restrain himself and . allow his daughter to do it her way. On . her part, the plucky 12-year-old quickly picked up the construction . jargon from her dad and learned how to safely use his power tools. Then on February 16, everything ground to a halt: Sicily’s father was killed in a car accident. As . her mother wrote on her daughter's blog two months later, Dane's . untimely passing caused Sicily to lose interest in the project. Dream team: Sicily pictured with her late father, Dane, who taught her the basics of construction and using power tools . Picking up the pieces: A couple of months after the car accident that killed Sicily's dad, the girl immersed herself into the building project with the help of friends  and DIY enthusiasts . Learning on the job: The middle-schooler went from a building neophyte to a real pro around drills and jigsaws . But under the guidance of her father's long-time friend and professional homebuilder, Luke Bair, Sicily once again immersed herself into her work on the tiny house, which now took on a deeper meaning for the grieving middle-schooler. The family and their friends made their way to a local Home Depot for supplies, revamped the blueprints and picked up where Sicily and Dane left off all these months ago. Not before long, Sicily and her mother were overwhelmed with support from loved ones and neighbors who would stop by the house to lend a hand with the myriad of tasks that go into building a house. But Dane Kolbeck's passing left a profound mark on Sicily: she was sullen and distracted in school, no longer as engaged in softball as before and lacking zest for life. To get away from it all, Suzannah and Sicily went on a five-week road trip, staying with friends in the mid-Atlantic region and enjoying long drives, just the two of them. When they returned home in time for the start of a new school semester, Sicily made up her mind to finish what she and her dad had started. Downsized: The cozy home features the bare necessities, including a loft bedroom big enough to fit a queen-size bed and storage space . This time, however, the now-13-year-old aspiring builder appealed to the boarder community, from other tiny-home aficionados on Facebook to experts and friends eager to pitch in. Many people volunteered their time, among them a roofer who put a top on Sicily’s humble abode free of charge; a retiree who instructed her in the art of wiring the house, and other homebuilders who showed Sicily how to plumb her kitchen and bathroom. What started as a school project over time blossomed into a 128-square-foot labor of love, as well as a tribute to Sicily’s father. Despite her tender age, Sicily Kolbeck showed everyone that she was dedicated to the project and determined to see it to completion, putting in long hours, navigating challenges and problem-solving on the fly like a seasoned pro. ‘It wasn't until later ... probably these past couple months that I realized why I'm doing this,’ Sicily said. ‘I'm doing it to show him that I can do stuff, to show him that I am capable and he doesn't need to yell at me when I can't use the drill.’ Last December, Sicily traveled to New Orleans to give a speech at a TEDYouth conference, talking to other teens about the joys and challenges of tiny-home construction - and healing. It takes a village: With the help of experts and staff at a Georgia Home Dept, Sicily learned how to plumb her tiny kitchen and wire the house . home on wheels: When Sicily and her mother move to Maryland this summer, her house will be coming with them . Around the same time, she was asked to pen a first-person account about her experiences for the Huffington Post. ‘Sometimes when people get a hard knock, they stay down. I didn't. That's my claim to fame,’ she wrote. ‘I also wanted to show that when I was handed lemons, I not only made lemonade. I made a lemon cake. And I ate it. And it was delicious.’ Last month, Sicily announced on her blog that her wooden masterpiece boasting a bedroom, fully functioning kitchen and bathroom, a closet and storage cubbyholes, was finally finished. From start to finish, it took Sicily and her many helpers a year-and-a-half of labor and $10,000 to get the job done. The charming little bungalow painted royal blue with a white trim for now sits in the Kolbecks' backyard in Marietta. When the family move to Baltimore this summer, Sicily’s house will travel with them. The girl, now 14 years old, is already thinking of her next makeover project: rebuilding a rickety, old Volkswagen Beetle.","It took Sicily Kolbeck, of Georgia, a year and a half of labor and $10,000 to build the 128-square-foot bungalow with a bedroom, kitchen and bathroom .

Mrs Alexander was a keen supporter of the Oxford Movement, and in 1848 published Hymns For Little Children, which include three of the most popular hymns in the English language: All Things Bright and Beautiful, Once In Royal David's City and There Is A Green Hill Far Away. The book was published in 69 editions and all the profits were given to Irish charities. She died in 1895 and is buried in Londonderry.

In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald in September, Granger explained that Bondi was where he wanted to open his first Bills but he was 'too young'. 'Bondi felt really right. When the lease was up on Woollahra, the opportunity to do Bondi came up and I thought, ""ohhhh that sounds quite exciting"".' 'Bondi has a great new energy about it. It's a lovely mixed-up crowd too which I really enjoy,' he said. Granger moved from Melbourne to Sydney in the late 1980s and worked at the now closed La Passion De Fruit in Surry Hills as a waiter while he studied art.

"With exposed oak beams, a brick fireplace and views across rolling countryside, this is Maria Miller’s stunning new home. It cost her £1.2million - almost exactly the profit she made selling a property funded by taxpayers. The embattled Culture Secretary swapped contracts on the sprawling barn conversation earlier this year as the expenses watchdog probed her claims. She is facing calls to quit over her false expenses claims, and has already had to pay back thousands of pounds and apologise to the House of Commons. Dream home: Maria Miller's new £1.2million converted Tudor barn in Hampshire . But her latest property has only now come to light. Mrs . Miller made taxpayers fund some of the mortgage payments on her London . property, then sold it and used the whopping profit to buy this . ‘charming’ Tudor house in Hampshire. It boasts five bedrooms, a spectacular vaulted gallery and its own woodland set in more than an acre of land. According . to Savills, the upmarket estate agent that handled the sale, the . reclaimed oak barn offers ‘a comfortable and convenient open plan family . home of substantial character and charm’. The . sitting room features a cast iron wood-burning stove, and a ‘rustic oak . bannister staircase’ leads up to the en-suite master bedroom and a . library.

A summer house and a capped brick well complete the idyllic setting. Land . Registry files show Mrs Miller, 50, bought the property on Valentine’s . Day this year with her husband Iain, 51, a partner in a City law firm. At the time, the inquiry was still going on into her expenses claims. The minister’s complicated - and taxpayer-assisted - journey up the property ladder started in 1996. Spectacular: The open-plan sitting room with its cast iron wood-burning stove and more oak beams . Tudor splendor: Mrs Miller's spacious oak-beamed dining room as pictured on the Savills website . The sitting room features a cast iron wood-burning stove and a ¿rustic oak bannister staircase¿ . In . January of that year, she and her husband bought a smart double-fronted . Victorian terrace house in Wimbledon, south-west London, for £234,000. At the time, she worked in advertising and was not an MP. In 2005, she became MP for Basingstoke and began renting a property in the constituency.

The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner has since ruled that this was the wrong way round. The embattled Culture Secretary swapped contracts on the sprawling barn conversation earlier this year . At the time, their mortgage had been increased to £525,000 - well over twice the amount they paid for the Wimbledon house. Taxpayers helped her fund the mortgage payments. Between 2005 and 2009, Mrs Miller claimed £90,718 in expenses for the property - close to the maximum permitted. In 2007, she increased the mortgage again, to £575,000. Again, taxpayers helped to meet the mortgage demands. After . the 2009 expenses scandal, Mrs Miller flipped the designation of her . properties to make the Wimbledon house her ‘main home’. And in February of this year, she sold it. A buyer paid £1.47million, a profit of £1,236,000. At the same time, she spent £1.2million buying the luxury retreat in Hampshire. The .

"Downsizing from a family home to a retirement property can  be a difficult business. Fears about  settling into a new community cause many people to postpone such a move or even cancel it completely – so in response to this, retirement villages are now offering ‘try-before-you-buy’ schemes. At Letcombe Regis in Oxfordshire, the location of one of five retirement communities operated by Richmond Villages, potential purchasers can spend a few days ‘on retreat’ to find out what living there permanently might be like. At Letcombe Regis in Oxfordshire potential purchasers can spend a few days 'on retreat' to find out what living there permanently might be like . Those who ‘try before they buy’ can use the development’s IT and craft rooms, library, bowling green  and kitchen garden, complete  with greenhouse. There is also a restaurant, café and a spa, which includes a gym, pool, treatment areas and a hair salon. Guests ‘on retreat’ have the same access to the facilities as full-time residents do. With Letcombe Regis’s shop having stone walls and a thatched roof – and with the buildings centred around a green – the community really does resemble a village. Ann Savage, 87, a retired GP, went to stay at Letcombe Regis retirement village in 2012 with her husband Paul, who has since died. ‘I had been quite ill,’ she says. ‘I’d had an infection of some kind so my husband and I came to Letcombe Regis for a week, just for a break.’ The couple liked it so much they put their house in London on the market and bought an apartment there. ‘Paul was 97 when he died last November and he was marvellously looked after in the care home here,’ adds Ann. There is also a restaurant, café and a spa, which includes a gym, pool, treatment areas and a hair salon. Guests 'on retreat' have the same access to the facilities as full-time residents do . ‘I can’t speak too highly of them and of course for me it was lovely because I didn’t have to go and visit him in a hospital. I could visit him whenever I wanted, for as long as I wanted. I think the staff in the care home are really brilliant.’ Ann says her only complaint is that there isn’t a booklet for residents detailing the many activities on offer such as Scrabble, art classes, tai chi sessions, film nights, discussion groups and live performances. Residents can also take advantage of genealogy workshops, singing sessions and trips to museums, stately homes and the theatre. When asked what the other residents are like, Ann says: ‘It’s like society, it’s a mixed bunch.’ Her apartment comprises a sitting room, bedroom, shower room and a small kitchen. ‘And there’s a very nice view out on to the brook,’ she adds. Ann Savage, 87, a retired GP, went to stay at the retirement village in 2012. Her apartment comprises a sitting room, bedroom, shower room and a small kitchen. 'And there's a very nice view out on to the brook' What sets this retirement village apart from others is that on one side of the complex is a beautiful lake, fed by the stream Ann mentions, Letcombe Brook. Barbara Przydatek, retreat co-ordinator at Letcombe Regis, is keen to emphasise how much freedom residents have to personalise their homes. ‘It’s their apartment,’ she says. ‘Short of making holes in walls – I mean big holes – they can do what they like. ‘Most people don’t repaint the rooms, they just hang up their pictures and move their furniture in. The only thing is that most apartments have a wet room with a shower and some people want a bath.’ Ann’s apartment feels quite individual, with South African art on the walls, reflecting her years working in hospitals there. With Letcombe Regis's shop having stone walls and a thatched roof, and with the buildings centred around a green, the community really does resemble a village . Although the property is small, Ann points out that it suits someone like her who walks with a frame. The number of ‘try-before-you-buy’ apartments at Letcombe Regis has risen from one to six, and the other Richmond Villages in the country – at Painswick in Gloucestershire; Nantwich in Cheshire; Northampton; and Bede Village, between Coventry and Bedworth in Warwickshire – now have dedicated apartments for people to experience the Richmond lifestyle. Letcombe Regis has a variety of homes and care packages tailored to individual requirements, from basic maid service to 24-hour nursing care. The apartments available there are currently priced from £275,000. Guests can stay ‘on retreat’ on a full-board, half-board or self-catering basis from £160 a night on a single occupancy basis for three nights. The Richmond Villages try-before-you-buy scheme began with people renting apartments for a few days to visit relatives living in the village, and Barbara is very pleased with the various ways in which the scheme has helped people. The Village Shop and cafe is in a stunning thatched building in the centre of the residence . ‘Not only has it been successful for people who have been interested in moving to a retirement village, but also for families who have realised that one or both of their parents could do with a little more assistance but have found the parents resistant to moving. 'They can bring them here and show them what it’s actually like to put their minds at rest. ‘I have experienced a number of occasions such as this which have resulted in the parents realising it is a positive move.

"Cherie and Euan Blair bought the flats in Manchester for £650,000 . Cherie Blair has dramatically expanded her family’s property empire by buying a block of flats. The ten apartments in Manchester take the Blairs’ portfolio to 18 homes. However, Mrs Blair is trying to sell the remaining flat from the notorious ‘Cheriegate’ scandal in 2002, when she bought two properties in Bristol with the help of a convicted fraudster. She has already slashed the asking price of that two-bedroom apartment, which has barely risen in value in 12 years. But the ten flats in Manchester seem a more promising investment, even though they come complete with a stinking rubbish dump at the back – and one of the residents is a Tory activist. Mrs Blair may have noticed a recent Nationwide house price survey saying prices in Manchester are rising at the fastest rate in the UK, beating even London. Within weeks, she and eldest son Euan paid a knock-down £650,000 for the ten-apartment block, five miles from Manchester city centre, via a company they set up earlier this year, Oldbury Residential Ltd. The flats are within two adjoining double-fronted Victorian houses which have been on sale for some time. Described by the estate agent as an ‘excellent buy-to-let investment’, the property was originally on the market for £850,000. Sources close to the Blair family said they plan to renovate the flats and rent them out to young professionals. The estate agent’s blurb said: ‘This prestigious development consists of nine luxury apartments and a simply spectacular and utterly unique luxury penthouse apartment. These apartments are currently tenanted, achieving a rental return of £4,650 per month.’ The two Victorian villas in Urmston, Manchester, have been converted into flats and sold to Mrs Blair and her son for £650,000 . Residents complained the rubbish had not been cleared for weeks before it was reported the Blairs had bought the building  - the rear of which is pictured . One tenant yesterday urged Mrs Blair to improve the upkeep of the four-storey building. McDonald’s worker Danielle Jackson, 24, who moved in with her fiance three months ago, said: ‘I hope she takes a personal approach to managing the properties because we’ve had a few problems. ‘There’s a rubbish dump at the back which hasn’t been cleared since I moved in, it’s such an eyesore and stinks. It could attract vermin. I hope she keeps the rent down because we can only just afford it. It’s a lovely area.’ Another resident, Tory party campaign worker, Alex Finney, 24, said: ‘I’ll give her a cup of tea if she comes for an inspection but I’ll have to try hard to keep my opinions to myself.’ The flat is about 30 miles from Bootle, the Labour stronghold on Merseyside where Euan, 30, is said to be interested in becoming a parliamentary candidate. Danielle Jackson, who moved in to the building three months ago with her fiance, is hopeful the Blairs will be good landlords . A pile of rubbish at the rear of the flats had not been cleared today as tenants spoke of their desire for change . Meanwhile, Mrs Blair, 60, is keen to sell her remaining ‘nightmare’ flat in Bristol, having sold the other in 2008. She paid £525,000 for them following a £69,000 discount negotiated by Peter Foster, an Australian conman who is still on the run. At the time, Foster was dating Mrs Blair’s confidante Carole Caplin, a former topless model. Rubbish lay in a heap as discarded wood and tarpaulin were scattered outside the buildings in Urmston . The Blairs bought the flats because their son Euan was going to Bristol University there. One was for him, the other was a buy-to-let investment. They sold the first flat in 2008 for £260,000, meaning they made no profit. The second was put on the market for £330,000 but the asking price has recently been dropped to £315,000.

"Bob Sinclair has spent the past six years building a house to live in with his wife Sheryl but his local council says he has less than a week left to knock it down. Mr Sinclair, 66, built part of the two-storey home in Elizabeth Park, north of Adelaide, with wood instead of the steel that the council had originally approved. He tried and failed to get his changes approved and as a result  the Environment, Resources and Development Court found in favour of Playford Council during a June hearing and ordered that the entire structure be demolished before next Tuesday. Bob Sinclair has less than a week to knock down his house in Elizabeth Park, north of Adelaide . Mr Sinclair, 66, has spent the past six years building it to live in with his wife Sheryl . 'We're looking into whether or not we can appeal but it appears the cost of the appeal would be prohibitive,' Mr Sinclair told Daily Mail Australia. 'The best we can get is an extension on the demolition order.' The block of land was originally purchased in 2006 by Mr Sinclair's daughter Vanessa Sinclair-Benke, but Mr Sinclair started building the house for him and his wife to live in. 'My daughter was looking for an investment property,' he said. 'We would have been paying the mortgage as the rent on the house.' Mr Sinclair first lodged a development application in June 2006, and council approved a two-storey steel framed dwelling and garage in January 2007. Work commenced in January 2008, and under the development approval work was required to be substantially completed by 11 January 2010, or else the approval would lapse. Mr Sinclair built part of the two-storey home with wood instead of steel and the council is forcing him to knock it down because he didn't get approval . Mr Sinclair said the price of steel went 'through the roof' after his first application and would have cost an extra $40,000 so he used timber instead, the Northern Messenger reported. In July 2011 a neighbour complained to council about inadequately secured roof sheeting on the partially built house which was flapping in the wind and making noise. The council's building surveyor investigated the complaint and found a number of defects in relation to the timber framing, gang nails leaving rafters and weather damage to the timber framing and flooring. It was then that he also discovered the framing had been built with timber not steel. Mr Sinclair was told in a letter he must lodge another development application seeking approval in relation to the timber framing in order to continue construction. On 26 April 2012, Mr Sinclair submitted a further development application and 'development plan consent' was granted on 5 November 2012. The block of land was originally purchased in 2006 by Mr Sinclair's daughter Vanessa Sinclair-Benke, but Mr Sinclair started building the house for him and his wife to live in . Before he could recommence construction, Mr Sinclair also required 'building rules consent' for the same development. No building rules consent had been obtained by November 2013, so an extension of time was granted. Mr Sinclair submitted building rule consent from private building certifiers Katnich Dodd in April 2014, but the council did not issue approval, saying his submission did not match the previous development application. On June 5 the council filed an application with the court for a demolition order, which was granted on June 27. Mr Sinclair told Daily Mail Australia his view was that the council had approved his development then 'changed its mind'. 'Eventually I got my building consent approval and the council withheld it and put on a demolition order,' he said. Playford Council has been contacted for comment.","Bob Sinclair  has less than a week to knock down his Elizabeth Park house .

"Paul Bagnall, 18, died after he tried to re-enact a Tudor hanging at his family home in Orpington, Kent . An A Level student who died while trying on costumes for a school play had been trying to re-enact a Tudor hanging, an inquest heard today. Banker's son Paul Bagnall, 18, was looking for a costume to wear in his parents' loft when the tragedy happened at the family home in Orpington, Kent. He was discovered by his mother Sandrine, 44, when she returned home at 4pm on 7 January and the inquest heard she initially thought it was a dummy placed there as a joke. Paul, a prefect at Darrick Wood School in Orpington, was wearing tights, a white ruffled shirt and a belt. Mrs Bagnall, 44, said: 'I thought it was actually a dummy hanging there and not Paul because it looked smaller than him. 'Then I realised there had been an accident. 'He had no problems, lots of friends and was looking forward to going to university. He was the sweetest, nicest boy.' 'We think he had tried to stage a Tudor hanging. The combination of tights and a laminate floor could have caused him to slip. 'He wasn’t a daredevil, but he took risks if he thought he was being careful.' In her statement read out at the inquest in Croydon, she said Paul had recently been on a trip to the Hampton Court archives and that his banker father Nick had been telling him about ancient Tudor rituals. She said: 'Nick told Paul that in Tudor times they used to tie prisoners up by their necks. 'Paul had said he needed a costume to act in a play at a fancy dress party at the end of his school ski trip in February. 'He was studying Tudor history for his A Levels, which explains how he was dressed when he was found.' She added: 'We had a dressing up box in the loft, and Paul and his sister Lauren regularly used to dress up in the school holidays in different costumes and accessories, on the spur of the moment.' Much loved son: Paul's mother Sandrine Bagnall, 44, told the inquest her son was 'the sweetest, nicest boy' There was a step ladder next to him, but Mrs Bagnall said Paul often used it so he could look in the mirror when he had costumes on. She said: 'It was not unusual for him to do that. 'Paul used to check his costume in the wardrobe mirror, which would explain where he was facing when he died. 'I’ve no idea how long he was up there.' Mrs Bagnall said she tried to get her son down and called paramedics, but he was pronounced dead 45 minutes later. The inquest heard the teenager had sat an exam earlier that day, but was not being bullied or under any stress. The cause of death was given as hanging. The A Level student was found by his mother, and despite her calling paramedics, he was pronounced dead 45 minutes later . South London coroner Dr Roy Palmer said there were no drugs or alcohol found in Paul’s body when he died. Recording a verdict of accidental death, he said: 'I’m satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Paul was in the loft searching around in the dressing up box and looking at himself in the mirror when he somehow slipped and gave in to an untimely death. 'I’m so very sorry it happened, and that you lost your son so tragically.' Paul spoke fluent French, played rugby for his school’s first team, and had been offered a place to study mechanical engineering in Southampton. His father, Nick, 57, added: 'He was a great boy and much loved by everyone who knew him. He was a great son and brother to his sister - a wonderful boy who did not have a bad bone in his body. 'His teachers said he was a natural mathematician and used to help his friends out with their work. 'Despite being a bit clumsy, through determination he became a good rugby player and a black belt in karate. 'He was always smiling. Even when he was in a karate bout he would be beaming - that’s the kind of person he was. He will be missed by so many people.' School principal Barbara Rhymaun described Paul as 'An exceptional student who was very popular amongst staff and students alike.'

"A group of Morris Dancers were ordered to stop performing in the middle of a routine after police received a complaint that their dancing was ‘offensive’. The 15-strong group of English folk dancers from the respected Wild Hunt Bedlam Morris troupe were told to ‘stop making a din’ during a performance outside The White Lion pub in Warlingham, Surrey. The folk dancers were performing in spooky costumes for a free Halloween show outside the 15th century pub to an audience of around 30 customers, but were cut short after just six dances. 'Noise nuisance': The 15-strong Wild Hunt Bedlam Morris troupe were told to stop in the middle of a performance after police received a complaint that their routine was 'offensive' Special show: The group were performing at The White Lion pub in Warlingham, Surrey, on the eve of Halloween . The group had planned at least 10 other dances, but were interrupted by two police officers who told them to ‘down’ their sticks and ‘move on’ as they were causing a noise nuisance. Despite pleading with the officers to continue their routine - which includes songs like Thor’s Hammer, Maiden Castle and Half a Farthing Candle, they were told to leave in the ‘interest of community relations’ last Tuesday. Morris dancer David Young, who has been dancing with the troupe for the past seven years, said he was disgusted that folk dancers were treated ‘like yobs’. The group perform a variety of traditional songs and dances such as Thor's hammer . The 69-year-old said: 'We did six dances and then, at about 9pm, we went in to have a drink before going back out to perform again. 'The next thing we know, two policemen arrived. They said, in the interest of ""community relations"", we think you should stop dancing.' He told the Croydon Advertiser newspaper: 'You would think the police would have let us carry on. 'It’s the first time we’ve encountered anything like it. 'We felt treated like yobs. But we’ve got ex-oil executives, business owners and a school secretary in our group. 'We just feel aggrieved that something that has such a long history in the country, at a time when it is hard to keep the old traditions alive, should not be allowed.' The respected troupe, which perform in masks and flamboyant costumes, celebrated its 21st anniversary earlier this year at the Tower of London, where the ancient Ceremony of the Keys - a 700-year-old tradition in which the tower is locked up for the night - takes place. Martin Saunders, 54, who was watching the dancing last Tuesday, said he was ‘appalled’ when they were ordered to stop. He said: 'The police came along while the Morris dancers were on a break and told them to move on as they were upsetting neighbours with their offensive dance routine. 'The police officers were a little shame-faced about it all, but really they should have just ignored it and let the dancing continue - it was only just after 9pm.' Renowned: The group has previously performed at the Tower of London's Ceremony of the Keys . 'Aggrieved': Members of the troupe were told to stop shortly after 9pm following a complaint from a neighbour . One pub worker, who asked not to be named, said: 'The police came because they got a complaint from a neighbour. 'I think everyone was a bit surprised really. Morris dancers have been dancing around in the area for years.' A Surrey Police spokesman said: 'We received a report from a member of the public about noisy revellers outside the White Lion pub in Warlingham. 'A neighbourhood police officer attended and spoke to a group. 'The noise had already stopped and no formal allegations were made and the group left the area without incident.' In August last year a group of Morris dancers from the Slubbing Billys troupe were booted out of the Swan and Three Cygnets pub in Durham after a barmaid said the bells on their shoes broke the bar’s music ban. Surprised: Staff at the White Lion in Warlingham, Surrey, said they were surprised at the intervention .","The Wild Hunt Bedlam Morris troupe were giving a free performance outside The White Lion pub in Warlingham, Surrey .

"Theresa May has asked for officials to carry out an 'urgent' review over whether the law on 'sexting' minors, which campaigners say leaves young people vulnerable to grooming, should be tightened . Sending a single 'sext' or sexual online message to an under-16 could become illegal, Theresa May said today. The Home Secretary  has asked officials to carry out an 'urgent' review on whether the law needs to be tightened. At present there is no specific offence against an adult sexual messaging with under-16s, except when it contains graphic images, or if an adult attempts to meet up with their victim to engage them in a sexual act. Campaigners argue it is vital to close this loophole so offenders can be stopped before they have a chance to groom their potential victim. Labour MP Heidi Alexander said that currently a child would have to be coerced into sending a sexual picture of themselves or actually meeting a sex offender before the police could take action. Speaking in the Commons, Mrs May said officials had been asked to consider the case for changing the law as an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill currently before Parliament. She told MPs: 'We do need to be able to intervene early so predatory behaviour is tackled before a child is put at risk.' The NSPCC has warned of an increase in children being sent explicit messages by adults. The charity's head of child safety online, Claire Lilley, said: 'No adult should be deliberately sending sexual messages to children, but incredibly it is not always illegal. 'Existing laws are a hotch-potch and sex offenders can and do exploit the loopholes. 'The rise of online communication means that children are increasingly being exposed to sexual messages from adults, on social networks or through messaging apps, but in many cases the police are powerless to act.' 'Currently, old laws are being stretched to fit new sex offender behaviour.' Campaigners say the existing laws 'are a hotch-potch and sex offenders can and do exploit the loopholes' A recent YouGov poll found four-in-five adults support a change in the law. Under section 15 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, it is an offence for someone over the age of 18 to communicate with someone under the age of 16 on at least two separate occasions and to then meet them or to travel to meet them with the intention to commit a sexual act. The maximum penalty is ten years' imprisonment.","Officials to carry out 'urgent review' on whether law needs to be tightened .

The lead on the project is Dr Deng Zigang, who has been developing the technology for a number of years. Maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track. This elimates the need for wheels and therefore any . incidence of friction, providing a faster and quieter service. Acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains. And maglev also makes for much smoother journeys. Right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres (250 miles) per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds. But vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future. In March 2013 they completed the first high-temperature superconducting maglev ring test, which was similar to the one you can see here but without the enclosed tube. But now the new ‘loop line’ could be set to usher in a new wave of faster trains than ever before. Maglev was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century. The first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low-speed shuttle at Birmingham International Airport in 1984. This travelled at a rather mundane 26 miles (42 kilometres) per hour. It was not until the turn of the century, though, that high-speed maglev would come into commercial operation, mostly in Japan and China. The world’s fastest passenger-carrying train is currently the Shanghai Maglev Train, opened in April 2004, which can reach 268 miles (431 kilometres) per hour. Super-maglev, however, could allow for even higher speeds. This is because, by using a vacuum tube, they decrease the speed limitations imposed by air resistance on regular maglev trains. In a paper on the subject, Dr Zigang says: 'If the running speed exceeds 400 kilometres (250 miles) per hour, more than 83 per ceny of traction energy will wastefully dissipate in air resistance.' And, he adds, 'Aerodynamic noise will break through 90 decibels (the environmental standard is 75 decibels).' The only way to break this barrier is to reduce the air pressure in the running environment, which he has done in his tube by lowering it to 10 times less than normal atmospheric pressure at sea level. 'Some systems (notably the Swiss metro system) have proposed the use of vacuum trains - Maglev train technology used in evacuated (airless) tubes,' he continues, 'which removes air drag and pushes the speed higher and higher.' 'ETT (Evacuated Tube Transport) systems might allow HTS Maglev trains to attain speeds in a new order of magnitude, such as super-high 3,000 kilometres (1,800 miles) per hour, which could be applied to some military or space launch systems. Dr Deng Zigang, associate professor of the Applied Superconductivity Laboratory at Southwest Jiaotong University, poses with the track where the super-maglev vehicle runs. The circle, China's first manned megathermal superconducting maglev loop line, is 12 metres (40 feet) in diameter . Super-maglev (pink) has the potential to improve travel times, as shown in this graph. Modern maglev (blue) still eclipses other forms of transport but cannot compete with planes over large distances . To further develop the project, Dr Zigang there are two phases that must be reached. ‘The first was to develop a ring line of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) maglev vehicle that can accelerate to a certain speed, 25 km (15 miles) per hour,’ he tells MailOnline. This target was achieved in February 2013, leading the researchers to move onto the next phase. 'The second phase is to cover the ring line with an evacuation tube (ET), which is called the ET HTS Maglev,’ continues Dr Zigang. ‘The vehicle was designed to accelerate to a maximum speed of 50 kilometres (30 miles) per hour without passengers. ‘This speed is limited by the small radius of the ring guideway, which is only six metres (20 feet).’ ‘The meaning of the project is that it will be the first one to realize the prototype of the future evacuation tube transportation (ETT). ‘At this moment, we are conducting evacuation tests on the new system. We will release our achievements after the successful running in the near future.' Dr Zigang operates a super-maglev vehicle by remote control during the trial run. In a paper he claims such enclosed tube maglev systems could reach speeds as high as 1,800 miles (3,000 kilometres) per hour, which 'could be applied to some military or space launch systems'","A researcher in China has unveiled his super-maglev loop line .

"A teenager who feared she would never walk again, is now preparing for a ballet exam after her spine miraculously healed itself. Megan Kershaw, 14, was diagnosed with a rare form of liver cancer in 2008, which caused her to collapse at school. During a nine-hour operation to remove three-quarters of the tumour, doctors discovered the cancer had spread to her spine, causing spinal fractures, and for years she was confined to a wheelchair. Megan Kershaw from Doncaster has now fully recovered from a rare form of liver cancer which caused her spine to collapse . It was during treatment that Professor Nick Bishop from Sheffield Children’s Hospital  suggested they should try and let the spine heal naturally. Now Megan's back is fully healed and doctors have been amazed by her speedy recovery. Professor Nick Bishop said: 'The speed of recovery is fantastic and just shows how well children’s bones can recover in this kind of situation. 'Her spine is healing itself without . any special treatment from us. The spine’s building blocks, the . vertebrae, have growth plates on their upper and lower surfaces. “It is these growth plates that have restored Megan’s vertebral architecture in such an exemplary fashion. 'Megan no longer needs to see me now . her spine has healed.' Relief: Megan pictured with her mother Deborah, and younger sister Bronwen, 12 . Megan is once again enjoying her favourite hobbies which include dancing, horse-riding, skiing and riding roller coasters. Her mother Deborah, 48, from Misson, near Doncaster said: 'She is a miracle. It is incredible what has happened and what the body can do. 'She’s back to being a normal healthy child and can do all the things her friends do. 'She has shown tremendous courage through everything and she’s back to her dancing which has helped her very much.' Megan still needs regular check-ups and is having a scan at the end of March to check on her progress. The youngster previously hit headlines when Simon Cowell paid for her to go on a trip to Disneyland in Florida for her 13th Birthday. He stepped in when he heard she had made a 'wish board' that included meeting him, Girls Aloud and the dream trip to Disney. Megan is now preparing for a Royal Academy of Dance ballet exam . next month. Dance tutor James Vaughan, who taught Megan before she was diagnosed with liver cancer said: 'Megan always had a great attitude and never missed a single lesson. 'When she was at her worst after the treatments had ravaged her body she first came back to class in a wheelchair unable to walk very well and she was a shadow of her former self. 'I was delighted to have her back and her determination to succeed despite her illness was an inspiration to us all.'","Megan Kershaw was diagnosed with rare liver cancer .

"A Missouri high school student who has said she only learned CPR 'a couple months ago' used her know-how to help an 11-month-old baby last week. Abby Snodgrass was at a Wal-Mart in High Ridge last Wednesday as a baby stopped breathing, KSDK reported. 'I was in the dressing room and I heard them call for the emergency over the radio,' Snodgrass said in an interview with the affiliate station. 'They said ""No pulse, no breathing."" And I just ran over there.' Scroll down for video . Rescue: Abby Snodgrass, pictured, performed CPR on an 11-month-old baby last week .

'And once I saw that no one was doing anything I asked if anyone knew CPR.' Snodgrass, who attends Hillsboro High School, also said of her CPR training 'It was just a couple months ago in my health class.' Speaking about the CPR, she told KSDK 'I was terrified. I remember thinking as I'm doing the compressions, what if this doesn't work? But I had to put it out of my mind.' Stepping in: Snodgrass (in blue) went toward the baby and performed CPR. She received CPR training at Hillsboro High School . Snodgrass was praised for her efforts by responding High Ridge Fire District Chief Mike Arnhart - with Arnhart telling the affiliate station the baby could have died otherwise. Jesse Barton, the Valle Ambulance District Chief, told KSDK that CPR training began for Hillsboro school district's high school students in fall 2013 - and that 'By the end of this year we will have taught around it to around 600 kids.' Snodgrass is enlisted in the National Guard and would like to speak to the baby's family again to see if they are alright, the affiliate station reported. In a statement to ABC News, the family of the baby said 'We are exceedingly grateful to the young woman who helped our daughter.

"Council workers were forced to use a chainsaw to hack their way into a property after it had been left to become completely overgrown by its owner. The eyesore in Crewkerne, Somerset, had stood vacant since 2006 before it was seized by South Somerset District Council. The neglected South Street property was visited by council officials, police officers and a bailiff who required a chainsaw to cut back the thicket and weeds in order to gain access to the front door. Council workers had to use a chainsaw to hack their way into this property (pictured) in Crewkerne, Somerset, after it had been left to become completely overgrown by its owner . The property has been vacant since 2006 and has now been seized by South Somerset District Council . Once inside, officials were greeted with an empty home stripped of its valuables, with graffiti on the fire-charred walls, smashed windows and a burnt out sofa. After several attempts to contact the owner of the property - who the council say has failed to pay council tax for at least six years - the authority gained a court order to seize ownership. It is hoped that, once the costs are recovered through sale at an auction, the house will be renovated and made available for a local family to move in. A district council spokesman said: 'This property had been left to rot and had become an overgrown eyesore not far from the centre of Crewkerne. The council found the house was empty with graffiti on the walls, smashed windows and a burnt out sofa (pictured) After attempts to contact the owner of the property - who the council say has failed to pay council tax for at least six years - the authority gained a court order to seize ownership of the house . 'On Friday we took over control of the property after repeated attempts to try and enter into a dialogue with the owner about the future of the property failed. 'A locksmith secured the property and it will also now be guarded by a security company to prevent vandalism. 'Loans and grants can be offered in appropriate circumstances and the council always tries to negotiate a successful outcome with all parties concerned, but at the end of the day if all attempts fail it can resort to enforcement action.' Council workers had to hack their way through overgrown bushes and weeds to enter the property (left). Once inside they were confronted with graffiti and vandalism (right) Councillor Shane Pledger, portfolio holder for empty properties, said: 'We prefer to negotiate with owners of properties to get them back into use, but the case of this property in Crewkerne goes to show what can happen if owners leave properties empty and refuse to do anything about them. 'We will do all we can to ensure that properties in south Somerset are not left empty, let's not forget that a property brought back in to use is one less property we have to build. 'We have to ensure that we have enough housing for our residents and by bringing properties back into use, we can achieve that.'

"Scroll down for video . A church in the US state of Virginia has taken the bizarre decision to allow its congregation to attend services in the nude. Pastor Allen Parker, the leader of White Tail Chapel in the town of Southampton, said he came to the decision to allow naked worship after concluding the clothing requirements of other churches were overly 'pretentious', and decided his own flock should be free to forgo such materialism if they desire. He believes he is in good company too, claiming many of the most important moments in the Bible happened while the protagonists were nude, including Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. Freedom: Pastor Allen Parker said he came to the decision to allow naked worship after concluding his flock should be free to forgo materialism and the 'pretense' of clothing if they desire . Equal: The idea is that nudity is 'the great equaliser', reminding all those gathered in the church that they are simple human beings beneath their clothing . Chapel: The pastor leads the church by example, standing in his pulpit without a scrap of clothing as he reads stories from the Bible to the faithful gathered in his small rural church in Southampton, Virginia (pictured) Speaking to CNN, Mr Parker said: 'When he [Jesus] was born he was naked, when he was crucified he was naked and when he arose he left his clothes in the tomb and he was naked.' 'If God made us that way, how can that be wrong?' he added. Mr Parker is believed to have drawn at least some of his opinions on nudity from the book of Genesis, in which Adam and Eve were originally described as 'both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed'. It was only after sinfully eating forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge that Adam and Even are said to have seen their nudity as shameful, at which point they sowed fig leaves into loincloths. Although the church allows worshipers to attend services fully naked, many have decided they would rather continue to attend fully clothed, particuarly when in mid-winter, while others opt to just reveal their breasts or genitals. The idea is that nudity is 'the great equaliser', reminding all those gathered in the church that they are simple human beings and that, beneath any personal wealth or glamorous outward appearance, they are all more of less the same beneath the clothing. 'There’s not a feeling that you have to be better than one another, physically. We’re humans, we have scars, we have what we have. It’s learning to love and accept that,' Mr Parker says. Pastor Allen Parker believes there's not a feeling that worshipers have to be physically better than one another in his church. He said: 'We're humans, we have scars, we have what we have' Marriage: The White Tail Chapel even hosts naked weddings. One couple to opt for the nude service were Robert and Katie Church . Although the church allows worshipers to attend services fully naked, many have decided they would rather continue to attend fully clothed, particularly in mid-winter . Different: Many worshipers opt to just reveal certain parts of their body, such as their breasts or genitals, rather than go fully nude . Taking influence: Pastor Allen Parker says many of most important moments in the Bible happened while the protagonists were nude, including Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (left) and Jesus' crucifixion (right) And the pastor leads the church by example, standing in his pulpit without a scrap of clothing as he reads stories from the Bible to the faithful gathered in his small rural church. The nudity is not restricted purely to preaching, however. Several couples have recently been married in fully nude services, in which all members of both families are encouraged to shed their clothing before the couple take their vows. Robert and Katie Church were one couple to have a naked wedding at the White Tail Chapel, with Mr Church saying attendees were far more interested in 'hearing the word of God and speaking the word of God' than analysing the naked bodies on display. Mrs Church wasn't a nudist before the couple met, but says she has since come to love the experience of going to church in the nude and now considers her fellow worshipers 'family'.","Congregation at White Tail Chapel, Virginia attend church while in the nude .

"It is the sort of story which sounds like it's out of a movie script but this really happened. Father-of-three Paul Furkert, 43, has spent the last 12 years lovingly restoring his 1949 Land Rover and on Saturday morning he decided to take it for a test drive  in preparation for a future journey. Mr Furkert lives in Carterton, a small town around 90km from captial city Wellington, New Zealand, so the area is full of remote country tracks perfect for testing out four-by-four vehicles. Paul Furkert is resting up at home with his family, including 12-year-old daughter, Xanthe, at home . This is what the Land Rover looked like 12 years ago when he started restoring it from scratch . Around 9am the IT consultant left his home to go and test out the his prized set of wheels and he told his son Aidan, 14, that he shouldn't be out for very long. Mr Furkert told Daily Mail Australia that as he was driving along the top of a 1100m-high ridge a 'rogue' gust of wind toppled the green vehicle and sent it rolling down the hillside. The model, which Mr Furkett had restored from scratch, did not have seat belts. Father-of-three Mr Furkert is laid up at home in Carterton, New Zealand after the accident on Saturday . He said: 'This happened down a remote down the back of a farm and the wind made it roll one and a half times and the vehicle ended up on its roof.' Mr Furkett managed to free himself from the vehicle and that was when he realised he had a broken leg. He told Daily Mail Australia: 'I got myself out of the Range Rover so it would not roll over me. 'I knew that my leg was broken and so I decided to try and make a splint because I was in a lot of pain. 'I unbolted one of the support struts for the canvas roof, removed one of the ropes that attaches the canvas to the side of the vehicle and used these to keep my leg straight. 'I had had first aid training and it ended up not being too painful when I put the splint in place. 'I settled in and ended up watching some wild goats who were on the hillside, it was pretty high up and and I watched the sun move from one side of the hillside to the other.' He said: 'We had a big garage and I thought why don't I restore a Land Rover, I had no mechanical experience' Mr Furkert did not have a mobile phone with him and he said he knew he would be waiting for a while for someone to come and rescue him. After seven hours of patient waiting a lone horse rider came across Mr Furkett stranded on the hillside. The horse rider didn't have a phone either and she had to go back for help. More than 30 rescuers eventually arrived and Mr Furkett could only be accessed by four by four vehicles. This is what the Land Rover looked like when it was fully restored by Mr Furkert over the 12 years . The Life Flight Trust air ambulance crew were able to land on top of the ridge and pick him up, reported the NZ Herald. Mr Furkert said: 'It was pretty windy and the alternative was to trek him on a stretcher down 6km of 'rough tracks'. He described to the NZ Herald how even police officers in a four-wheel drive found it difficult to get to him on the gravel tracks. 'I heard one of them went into a ditch on the way out.' Mr Furkett said he would be in a plastic cast for three months and said 'I will get back on the road eventually'.","Father-of-three Paul Furkert spent 12 years restoring his  Land Rover .

"What a finish, what a game, what a quarterback. And why didn't they run it? The New England Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28-24, but that does not come close to telling the story. This was a game which had it all. A last-minute interception by a rookie free agent, an insane catch which made David Tyree's look pedestrian, a previously unknown receiver going for over a hundred yards after collecting his first four passes in the NFL and another chapter in the storied dynasty of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. In winning the Super Bowl MVP title for the third time in his career, Brady showed all of his trademark precision and poise to lead the Patriots to their fourth Super Bowl title, somehow coming back from a ten-point deficit to defeat the defending champion Seattle Seahawks.

In his record sixth appearance in the NFL’s seasonal showpiece, the 37-year-old showed all the resilience and leadership gleaned from his storied career, using short passes to slice through Seattle’s No 1 ranked defense. Protected by his offensive line, time and again he picked apart Pete Carroll’s side, showing mental acumen, poise and above all leadership to go 4-2 in Super Bowls. In a dramatic, seesaw game the game-changing moment came in the fourth quarter with Rob Ninkovich’s sack on Russell Wilson.

Ominously lurking near the end zone, Brady assessed his options. But Jeremy Lane plucked his poor pass to Danny Amendola out of the air. The young cornerback broke his left arm in the process. While Wilson showcased all of his elusive qualities, when he looked up, New England’s coverage wrapped up receivers was such that he no open target. That was to change. Brady broke the deadlock with an 11-yard pass to Brandon LaFell, connecting with the wide open receiver with typical precision.

The world seemed to stop as he threw to his right and Chris Matthews’ magnificent leap beat Kyle Arrington to the ball deep in New England territory. Lynch took over, pounding through the Patriots trenches. To deafening chants of ‘Beast’ he carried the ball first four, then three yards. Another three-yard charge levelled the score at seven apiece, but the exuberant 28-year-old did not grab his crotch in celebration. With two minutes and 16 seconds on the clock, Brady hit back with a trademark two-minute drill. Seeing a mismatch in coverage, Gronkowski reined in his perfect 23-yard toss to put the Patriots ahead with 31 seconds remaining.

Seattle simply motored into action, with the tone set by running back Robert Turbin’s 19 yard rampage. Wilson picked up the baton, darting a further 17. The momentum visibly shifting, Seattle were handed a gift in the shape of 15 yards following Arrington’s face mask. From New England’s 21, Wilson again found Matthews, this time in the end zone. Astonishingly, Seattle were level. Matthews and Wilson continued where they left off after the break, but New England’s defense held firm, restricting Seattle to Steven Haushka’s field goal. For the first time in the game, Seattle were ahead. Brady was intercepted for the second time with Bobby Wagner picking him off and Seattle increased their lead to ten points as Doug Baldwin darted across the end zone to reel in Wilson’s floated pass to give Seattle a ten-point lead. Surely the game was over. But Brady and the Patriots had other ideas. The University of Phoenix Stadium all set for kick-off in Super Bowl 49 between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks .

"End game: A judge may rule next week on whether Shrien Dewani, pictured, has a case to answer about his alleged role in the plot to murder his wife . Shrien Dewani's lawyers today said they would apply for all charges against him to be dropped as prosecutors abruptly closed their case against him. Judge Jeanette Traverso may rule next week on whether the 34 year-old businessman has a case to answer about his alleged role in the plot to kidnap and murder his wife, Anni. If she decides in favour of Dewani, he could boarding a plane back to Britain – a free man - within hours. If not, his lawyers will have to decide whether to put him in the witness box to give his version of events – and face tough questions about what happened on the night his new bride was murdered. The decision by defence lawyers to apply to have the case against Dewani dismissed - under section 174 of the Criminal Procedures Act - was not unexpected following a series of blows to prosecution. One of the compelling elements in the case against Dewani was motive – the fact that he had a secret gay life was, prosecutors concluded, a powerful reason for wanting to be out of his new marriage. However, when on day one of the trial, Dewani informed the court that he was bi-sexual and frequented male prostitutes, clubs, chat rooms and extreme websites – much of the evidence compiled by the state relating to Dewani's sexuality was later ruled inadmissible by the judge. A gay escort, called 'the German Master,' whom Dewani had paid for three sex sessions, involving drugs, physical and verbal abuse and role play, was allowed to give only brief live testimony. A bundle of sexually-explicit emails between Dewani and an unnamed older lover were also ruled inadmissible. Testimony from the Swedish bride's first cousin and confidante, Sneha Mashru, was also excluded following a successful application by defence lawyers. Lawyers Francois van Zyl and Pieter Botha were also successful in highlighting discrepancies in the evidence of 'star' prosecution witnesses – taxi driver Zola Tongo and hitman Mziwamadoda Qwabe. Zola told the court he had been recruited by Dewani to organise the contract killing of his new wife, within minutes of dropping the newlyweds at their honeymoon hotel. Qwabe told the court that he had been hired by Tongo who said he had 'a husband who wanted his wife killed.' Victim: Anni Dewani was found killed by a bullet through her neck after the cab she was riding in with her husband on their honeymoon in Cape Town was hijacked as it travelled through a township . Their word: Hitman Mziwamadoda Qwabe, left, and taxi driver Zola Tongo, right, were prosecution witnesses . Prosecutors brought their case to a sudden close following a meeting in which the two sides led to agreement on evidence related to calls and messages between Dewani, Tongo and the hitmen and also the results of primer residue tests. A source close to the defence said the decision to apply for the case to be discharged 'is never made lightly', but added 'we wouldn't apply for a discharge unless we had some confidence about our chances of success.' The family of Mrs Dewani – who marked the fourth anniversary of her death last week with a visit to the township road where she was found dead from a fatal gun shot wound to the neck – looked tense and anxious as the court was adjourned. The defence will compile written arguments in favour of having the case against Dewani discharged and submit them to the judge by the end of Wednesday. The prosecution will then have until the end of Friday to challenge them. The Judge will hear the arguments in open court on Monday - after that, she could announce her decision straight away, or ask for time to consider.","Judge may rule as early as next week whether there is a case to answer .

"FIFA Puskas award runner-up Stephanie Roche has announced she is joining National Women's Soccer League side Houston Dash. The Republic of Ireland international, who only signed for French side ASPTT Albi in July last year, has penned a two-year deal with the American outfit. The 25-year-old forward, who has scored four times for her country, became the first women to be shortlisted for the prestigious accolade in December, after a stunning volleyed goal for former side Peamount United against Wexford Youths in October 2013. Stephanie Roche is all smiles as she is pictured in the Houston Dash home strip . The Republic of Ireland forward has moved to the American side on a two-year deal from ASPTT Albi . Roche, pictured at the 2014 Ballon d'Or award ceremony, has joined Houston Rush . The 25-year-old pictured in an exclusive interview with Sportsmail back in France in December 2014 . The goal ensured she became an internet sensation on YouTube, which in turn catapulted her onto the international stage. The forward left Ireland to move over to France in July, but Roche admits she rushed into the decision and didn't take several key factors into consideration. In an interview with the Irish Independent she said: 'I have taken my time with this. A lot of people have been asking me where I was going. 'With France I think I may have jumped into it too fast. I didn't think about everything. I never thought the language barrier would be as big an issue as it turned out to be in the end. 'No Irish woman has ever gone over to play in the NWSL though, so it is going to be a big challenge for me. I am under no illusions it is going to be easy. 'I am going to have to work hard and get my place in the team so I am really looking forward to getting over and meeting my team-mates and getting to know them better.'

Dash head coach Randy Waldrum expressed his delight at the signing adding: 'I am so excited about the signing of Stephanie. 'We are getting a player that has great technical ability, a superb left foot, and possibly the best goalscorer to come out of Ireland since Olivia O'Toole. 'She will bring a wealth of international experience to our team, and another great attacking option that is different from what we have already. 'All our Dash fans and fans of women's soccer in general will be excited about this signing.' Roche is expected to make her debut on April 10 against Washington Spirit at the BBVA Compass Stadium, pending receipt of her P-1 Visa and ITC, which were not disclosed in the deal.","Stephanie Roche has signed for Houston Dash on a two-year deal .

"Eiropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has faced growing questions about his involvement in tax policy when prime minister of Luxembourg . Senior Conservatives have called for European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to be investigated over claims he encouraged tax avoidance. Cabinet ministers said Mr Juncker, who denies wrongdoing, should be scrutinised over allegations that he encouraged companies to avoid tax while he was finance minister and prime minister of Luxembourg. And the Labour party warned that if more evidence emerged against Mr Juncker 'serious questions' will be asked about him continuing in his powerful Brussels role. Mr Juncker has admitted that as prime minister he was 'politically responsible' for what happened in each and every corner of the country', but suggested he did not know the tax deals were being negotiated. Companies such as Burberry and Dyson had their divisions in Luxembourg lend money to their operations in other countries. The interest payments made on these loans reduced the profits in these countries. In some cases it was claimed companies enjoyed tax rates of less than 1 per cent on profits moved into the Grand Duchy. Some Tory backbenchers have already called for Mr Juncker to resign. But in a major escalation of pressure on the burecrat, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps have backed the need for an investigation into the issue. Mr Duncan Smith said he did not know if the matters were true or false but said the European Commission needed to show it had 'no fear of investigating their own'. He did not name or criticise Mr Juncker directly when asked about the issue on BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics. But he said: 'This is a real moment for the European Union, for the commission, to show that it has the capacity and the determination to investigate its own and so if there is an issue, if there is some serious issue about a conflict and at one time one thing is being said and at another thing is being done, then these things need to be investigated and made public. 'And as soon as they're made public decisions have to be taken. 'The trouble for the European Union historically has been that it circles the wagons around the people that are having the finger pointed at them and refuses to let any kind of change takes place.' Questioned if he expected Mr Juncker to be thoroughly investigated by the commission, Mr Duncan Smith replied: 'I think what is required from the European Commission is complete transparency.' When pressed if this meant Mr Juncker's case, the Cabinet minister replied: 'Yes. I would say the same by the way if it were Britain. 'You need to make sure when you're saying one thing and doing one thing that you don't then say and do another at the same time, so there has to be an absolute clear purpose and at the same time a determination of the European Commission to make sure this whole issue is not brushed under the carpet but is transparent, open and investigated and then decisions can be taken one way or another.' Mr Juncker, pictured (front right) with world leaders at the G20 summit in Brisbane at the weekend, has denied any wrongdoing . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Tory party chairman Grants Shapps have said it is right for Mr Juncker to be investigated . Mr Shapps, the Tory party chairman, said it was important that those in senior roles in Europe are held to account. He  told the same programme: 'I haven't seen all this evidence. 'I think it is absolutely right that it is properly investigated and that is what I hope will happen next. 'But either way the important thing is to hold Europe to account and to do that you've got to have a credible in-out referendum so you can have these negotiations about all of this stuff.' Last week it emerged that speeches Mr Juncker made while prime minister of Luxembourg including an announcement to parliament that AOL and Amazon were planning to move their European headquarters to the country thanks to favourable corporate tax conditions his government had created. Labour's shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden also warned Mr Juncker's role could be put into doubt. Asked if Mr Juncker should resign or stand aside while the claims are examined, shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'I think there's little chance of that but I think if more comes out on this then really serious questions will have to be asked about his position.' Despite being Luxembourg's prime minister for 18 years - 15 of which were also spent as finance minister - Mr Juncker last week denied being involved in shaping the tax rulings that critics say enable corporations to slash their tax bills by shifting their European operations to the country. 'There is nothing in my past indicating that my ambition was to organise tax evasion in Europe,' he said during a press conference, adding that he was 'not the architect of what you could call the Luxembourgish problem'. Instead he said it was up to the current Luxembourg government to explain the situation..","Iain Duncan Smith and Grant Shapps pile pressure on Commission chief .

"As the world continued to search for answers over the downing of Flight MH17, the internet came alive with conspiracy theories today. The Web has long been a haven for numerologists and conspiracy crackpots peddling their alternative analyses of events that shake the world. And today was no different as web sleuths across the globe rushed online in a bid to hypothesize over what really happened to the doomed Malaysian Airlines passenger plane . . . Scroll down for video . All seeing eye: The Illuminati insignia is on the American dollar bill. Many modern conspiracy theories propose that world events are being controlled and manipulated by the Illuminati. Some believe the group was behind the Battle of Waterloo, the French Revolution and JFK's assassination . Russia Today sparked a fever of speculation last night after publishing a report that claimed the doomed flight was flying almost the exact same path as Putin's presidential plane did less than 40 minutes later. It quoted a source as telling Interfax news agency: 'I can say that Putin’s plane and the Malaysian Boeing intersected at the same point and the same echelon. The presidential plane: Russia Today pointed out that Putin's presidential plane bears uncannily similar red and blue markings to those painted on all Malaysian Airlines craft, including MH17 . The downed airliner:  The report claimed the doomed flight (pictured) was flying almost the exact same path as Putin's presidential plane did less than 40 minutes later . 'That was close to Warsaw on 330-m echelon at the height of 10,100 meters. The presidential jet was there at 16:21 Moscow time and the Malaysian aircraft—15:44 Moscow time.' It goes on to point out that Putin's presidential plane bears uncannily similar red and blue markings to those painted on all Malaysian Airlines craft. Did US president Barack Obama actually order the strike in a bid to assassinate Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin? Some Twitter users think so... Bumbled assassination attempt? Within minutes of the report, Twitter was flooded by claims the shooting was merely a mistake by bumbling assassins . Within minutes of the report, Twitter was flooded by claims the shooting was a botched assassination attempt. Some even took it to mean US president Barack Obama ordered the C.I.A. to carry out the alleged hit. '#OBAMA TRYING TO KILL #PUTIN #Putin's plane was following 'almost same route' as crashed #MalaysianAirlines #MH17,' gushed one excited user. Another blamed banking dynasty the Rosthchild Family. 'ROTHSCHILDS TRIED TO KILL PUTIN & HIT WRONG PLANE TODAY - ALL BECAUSE OF BRICS BANK & USD END - HOW STUPID COULD THIS ZIONIST IDIOT BE?,' Dave Rocki blasted. Many have claimed that The Illuminati carried out the attack as part of its longstanding masterplan to trigger a third world war and thus establish a New World Order ... chiefly because of the plane's links to the number seven. Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was a Boeing 777 and made its maiden flight on July 17, 1997 - 17 years ago to the day, many theorists point out. On top of that, July is the seventh month of 2014. Adding up the year's numbers (2+0+1+4) makes seven. Mike . Glover wrote on Twitter: '#planecrash #Malay #Plane a #False #Flag? to . escalate war & tensions -numbers though? Date 17/ 7 Flight 17 plane . #777 #conspiracy #theory ?' A writer on conspiracy website Before It’s News claimed the tragedy was 'clearly' an attempted false flag to launch a new global war. They wrote: 'The occult/illuminati connection to this plane crash are laid out in the video below and are absolutely stunning as the NWO (New World Order) attempts to start WW3 as their grip on power falls apart as the US dollar dies and on the same day TWA Flight 800 was shot down in 1996.' The number . seven is a figure that has long been associated with the clandestine . group, who are said to view it as the essence of perfection. The Illuminati did it: Many sought to link The ancient Illuminati with the atrocity because of its links the number seven . Blogger IlluminatiWatcher.com wrote: 'I followed the previous Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 (exhaustively) and concluded that it must've been aliens; one of the first conspiracy theories to surface, and until we hear otherwise I'm sticking with it. In that MH370 conspiracy theories post I referenced the fact that the alleged Illuminati might have been involved due to the number 777 being tied in.

Many modern conspiracy theories propose that world events are being controlled and manipulated by the Illuminati, a secretive and ancient society blamed by proponents for a string of world events including the Battle of Waterloo, the French Revolution and President John F. Kennedy's assassination. There have even been suggestions that the group is in fact a Communist pressure party hellbent on creating a new world order by infiltrating the Hollywood film industry. MH17 was shot down 17 years to the day since its maiden voyage ... The group's involvement was further bolstered by a New York Times journalist who revealed the plane was shot down 17 years to the day since its maiden voyage. C. J. Chivers tweeted: 'Haunting: Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, Reg 9M-MRD, made 1st flight on 7-17-97. It met its end 17 years later, to the day -aviation official' A coincidence or not, it was enough proof for many that a sinister plot was to blame. What really happened? The Web has long been a haven for numerologists and conspiracy crackpots peddling alternative analyses of the events that shake the world . Did Israel mastermind the shoot down to divert world's gaze from its assault on Gaza? Some people even took to MailOnline's own comment section to expound their hypotheses. 'Benji', from London wrote: 'Did Israel have something to do with it? It's incredibly convenient for the government of Israel that the day before they launch their ground attack on Gaza. 'World attention and media coverage has been diverted from that to this MH17 incident. Could Israel be behind it so they can launch their attack on Palestine, and the inevitable deaths of hundreds of civilians that is likely to come with it, without international media and governmental scrutiny?? hmmmmm.' Benji didn't stand alone in his analysis today. Max Weedon added on Twitter: 'Missile downs flight #MH17 over Ukraine; Israel begins ground offensive against Hamas. Are the two linked?' Comrades in alarm: Benji didn't stand alone in his analysis today . Many Twitter users claimed pictures of victims' passports found at the scene were in too good a condition to have possibly been involved in the crash. 'How could the passports found at the #MH17 crash site be so pristine? Wondering if these are authentic,' wrote Mamadoxie. 'Pristine passports': Many Twitter users claimed pictures of victims' passports found at the scene were in too good a condition to have possibly been involved in the crash . Another blasted: 'Look at these passports in pristine condition recovered from teh MH17 crash. Just like the 9/11 passport #falseflag.' This argument appeared a little less-well researched than some of its counterparts. But a lack of hard evidence didn't stop theorists sharing their views that MH17 was in fact MH370 - the plane that disappeared over the Indian Ocean in March.

"A Muslim cleric at the centre of an illegal marriage scandal has stepped down after he allegedly offered to marry a 12-year-old girl to a man in his 20s. Imam Mohamed Kassamali is said to have told an undercover reporter posing as a father that he could carry out a ceremony for his school-aged daughter. He allegedly told the Sunday Times journalist: 'If it (the marriage) was not possible, I . would have told you straight away... I would love the girl to go to her . husband’s houses (sic) as soon as possible, the younger the better. Sting: An undercover reporter filmed two imams agreeing to officiate at the wedding of a 12-year-old girl and a man in his 20s . Child bride: An imam at the Husaini Islamic Centre in Peterborough has stepped down temporarily while the incident is investigated . 'Under Sharia (Islamic law) there is . no problem. It is said she should see her first sign of puberty at the . house of her husband. 'The problem is that we cannot explain such things (the marriage) if the girl went tomorrow (to the authorities). 'The other thing is the underage thing . and if tomorrow the girl is, let’s say coerced or forced into this, and . she goes and reports it to the police then she will put all of us into . the problems.' The imam, who worked at the Husaini Islamic Centre in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, apparently urged the father to encourage the newlyweds to 'delay the togetherness' - meaning they should postpone having sex. A statement released by the Islamic Centre read: 'The management and members of Peterborough’s Husaini Islamic Centre do not recognise the alleged remarks of Imam Mohamed Kassamali, who is reported to have discussed the possibility of underage marriage in Britain with The Sunday Times. Campaigners argue that children can't decide whether they want to be married (posed by model) 'In line with our practice, we are in the process of carrying out a full independent inquiry on this matter. 'The imam has temporarily stepped aside by mutual consent with the centre while an investigation takes place. 'A legal, British civil marriage certificate is a prerequisite for any Islamic (Nikah) officially conducted at the Husaini Islamic Centre. 'We respect the law of the land and since the establishment of the Husaini Islamic Centre, no under legal age marriages have been conducted at the centre, nor will it be allowed. 'We find the practice of forced marriages to be abhorrent, reprehensible and totally un-Islamic and we support the Forced Marriage Unit, established by the Government, in its attempts to tackle this issue.' A second imam, retired Abdul Haque, . who still officiates at weddings at Shoreditch mosque, East London, . reportedly agreed to carry out the ceremony after evening prayers on . a Wednesday. He allegedly told the reporter: 'Tell people it is an engagement but it will be a marriage. 'In Islam, once the girl reaches . puberty the father has the right, the parents have the right, but under . the laws of this country if the girl complains and says her marriage has . been arranged and she wasn’t of marriageable age, then the person who . performed the marriage will be jailed as well as the mother and father.’ He explained how the Prophet Muhammad . had married a seven-year-old girl before adding: 'We are his followers, . and that is what you have to explain (to your daughter).' Secret: Retired imam Abdul Haque, who works at Shoreditch Mosque in East London, allegedly told the reporter to say the marriage was only an engagement . UK law lets imams marry consenting under-16s provided they do not have sex until the age of 16. The Home Office has now confirmed . that such ceremonies will be examined in the Government’s forthcoming . Bill to outlaw forced marriages. More than 1,000 of the 8,000 forced . marriages of Britons each year are believed to involve girls of 15 or . under, with one case last year allegedly involving a girl of five. After being confronted, Kassamali . said he would not have performed the marriage without the girl’s consent . and would have sought legal advice. Haque declined to comment.

"As delicious as they taste, every diner knows that chicken nuggets and hotdogs aren't exactly made from prime cuts of meat. Indeed, most of us try and push the image of trotter or carcass to the back of our minds when eating processed food. Now, one photographer has laid bare the grisly reality of where our favourite foods come from - and it's probably enough to deter you at least temporarily, if not for life. Scroll down for video . Grisly: Texan-born Peter Augustus has taken photos of popular dishes alongside the real, raw part of the animal they come from, in a bid to raise awareness . Sanitised: 'Most of us seldom see anything that even closely represents what kind of animal we are eating - it is always pre-packaged, nice and neat, showcased in an air-conditioned supermarket,' said Mr Augustus . Taken by Texan-born Peter Augustus, they show popular dishes alongside the real, raw part of the animal they come from. While nuggets are chicken feet, a ham sandwich is a pig's trotter and a hot dog is an unappetising-looking piece of intestine. Mr Augustus says the project - inspired by his move to Hong Kong - 'is not meant to be repulsive, but to raise awareness' of where popular dishes actually come from. He said: 'Arriving in Hong Kong for the first time, a city overloaded with visual stimulation, one of the most impactful scenes for me was the meat shops found in my neighbourhood of Sai Ying Pun. 'As a foreigner from a major city in the West, most of us seldom see anything that even closely represents what kind of animal we are eating when we purchase it – it is always pre-packaged, nice and neat, showcased in an air-conditioned supermarket. 'Being forced to pass by these meat shops on a daily basis with their pig heads, intestines, eyeballs and hearts hung on hooks out in the open lead me to challenge myself to view these shops as a normal place where actual food was being sourced every day, that ended up in my meal at a local restaurant.' Mr Augustus - who is not vegetarian - says his work, 'a personal therapeutic process', explores the relationship that most Western societies have with the meat that they eat. 'It's a disconnect between what it actually is they are eating and what it was before it was prepared for consumption.' He added: 'Shot using a white background with lighting meant to evoke an American diner or cafeteria, I take out the clean cuts and replace them with a real representation of the animal the meat comes from. 'By doing this, I hope to cause the viewer to take into account what the natural form of their food looks like.' Authentic: He hopes the project will help diners think about the natural form their food takes . Transformed: Mr Augustus admits the project has changed his eating habits. 'I now make an effort to know where and how the animal I am eating was raised - and the results do dictate if I end up eating it' Mr Augustus believes his work 'highlights a number of important debates' - such as the longstanding debate of the quality of chicken and meat products and 'the use of unnatural fillers and hormones in the animal products we eat daily.' The project itself was a labour of love - an involved traipsing around until he found a friendly bucher who could speak sufficient English. 'She thought it was funny, as she could tell I was a little bit uncomfortable being surrounded all the raw meat,' he recalls. In fact, her main focus was food handling and preparation. 'She didn't understand why a white person wanted all of these things to photograph and was very concerned if I knew how to handle it properly. 'She also told me how to cook and eat it, which I did not.' However he admits the project has changed his eating habits. 'I now make an effort to know where and how the animal I am eating was raised - and the results do dictate if I end up eating it. 'Not to sound preachy, but I think if more meat eaters did that, I think there would be less animosity from overly passionate vegans.'","Peter Augustus, who lives in Hong Kong, photographed popular dishes alongside the real, raw part of the animal they come from .

"By day, well-spoken Katy Lees is a serious businesswoman running her own cleaning firm. But by night, she transforms herself into a sexy, self-styled 'queen of the chavs' female wrestler. The 24-year-old from Worcester has been impressing fans with her loudmouth alter-ego 'Chardonnay'. When in character, she wears pink Burberry hot-pants, a diamante encrusted cap and gold chain. She was first introduced to the sport as a child when her older brother and his friends used to try out their combat moves on her after watching wrestling shows. Scroll down for video . Katy Lees runs her own cleaning firm (left), but by night she transforms herself into a sexy self-styled 'queen of the chavs' female wrestler (right) And since taking up wrestling in her spare time, Katy now travels the UK performing in bouts and is now poised to enter the lucrative American wrestling scene. Since taking up the sport, super-fit Katy has had two teeth knocked out and once had to go to A&E after her head was slammed on the floor of the ring. This week she is preparing for a title fight in her home town of Worcester. The unusual hobby has taken a toll on Katy, who has even had teeth knocked out in the ring . If successful, she hopes to give up her cleaning career and become a full-time competitor on the wrestling circuit in America. She said: 'I decided on my alter ego of Chardonnay because it is the furthest thing from me. I hate chavs and it gave me the opportunity to really play at being someone else. 'It gives me a chance to rebel which is really fun because I'm still living at home with my mum and do cleaning during the day, so it's a complete change of scene. 'It's hilarious, I get in the ring and start behaving like a juvenile delinquent. I'm usually the villain so the more people that boo, the better. 'I got into it as a kid when my brother used to watch it. His friends would come round and try all their wrestling moves on me.' Katy says wrestling is her way of rebelling and hopes to soon be able to quit her cleaning job to compete in the sport full time . She added: 'Mum had to take me to A&E once because they did a 'Power Bomb' on me and I banged my head really badly. 'But I still loved it, and when I got the chance to go and try it about five years ago it was amazing. 'So as soon as I got a car I started going to training in Gloucester every week, and started thinking about an alter-ego. 'When I began entering actual shows at the beginning of this year I had to have a definite character, and since chavs aren't particularly popular anyway I thought that would be funny. 'People shout stuff at me all the time when I'm in the ring but I play up to it, I just like to pretend I'm Vicky Pollard or that Catherine Tait character, Lauren Cooper. 'My dream is to get picked up by NXT, which is the development branch for WWE in Florida. 'That would be absolutely amazing, but I know I will have to work really hard to achieve that. Katy says she picked her 'chav' character when she began competing in shows as she thought it would be funny and it allows her to play the villain in the ring . 'At the moment we usually get about two hundred people coming to shows, and there is always one female fight on the ticket. 'My mum comes to watch sometimes, and my friends have been along too and they just think it's hilarious. 'I set up my own company cleaning people's homes just before I got into wrestling three years ago, because I knew I was going to need a flexible job if I'm going to pursue this long term.' Katy's mother, Jackie, 57, who works as a carer, fully supports her daughter's unusual sport. She said: 'I really like the wrestling too. 'My dad used to make us watch it, and I wasn't sure about Katy getting into it because I thought there were no other girls interested, but there are. 'I've been to see her a few times now and enjoyed it a lot. 'People have only heard of the American wrestling usually but the standard of British wrestling is really good too.' Promoter Lee Hall said he believed she has what it takes to make it in WWE, the world's biggest wrestling corporation. He said: 'I really think she's got what it takes to make it. She's very determined, she's physical and she's very attractive as well. 'I truly believe she's got the quality they look for in the WWE. 'I had one young lady who went to America to work for WWE but it wasn't really her cup of tea and she came back after a few months.'","Katy works full time running her own cleaning company .

"The convicted killer of 13-year-old schoolboy Daniel Morcombe spends his time confined to his maximum security jail cell as he's too scared to leave because he fears attacks by other inmates. Brett Peter Cowan has been behind bars for eight months after being found guilty of killing and dumping Daniel's body on the Sunshine Coast in 2003. The 45-year-old, who is set to appeal his murder conviction this month, is still considered one of Wolston Correctional Centre's most at-risk inmates, the Courier Mail reports. Scroll down for video . Brett Peter Cowan has been behind bars for eight months after being found guilty of killing and dumping Daniel's body on the Sunshine Coast in 2003 . Cowan has been in protective custody since he was sentenced and has had no visitors since his parents saw him immediately after his conviction in March. He eats his food in his maximum security cell and only goes out for brief periods each day, which requires high level security escorts to guard him down the halls. He is reportedly too much of a target to take a prison job like other inmates.

"Daniel Morcombe’s killer Brett Peter Cowan will appeal his murder conviction in a hearing next month. However, the attorney general will also appeal Cowan’s sentence at that time, arguing that 20 years non-parole is ‘manifestly inadequate’ for Cowan’s crime, which could see the 45-year-old’s prison time extended. In March, Cowan was found guilty of murder, indecent treatment of a child and interfering with a corpse, after abusing and killing Daniel in an abandoned house after abducting the teen from a Sunshine Coast bus stop. A covert police operation culminated in Cowan’s arrest in August 2011, after Cowan unknowingly confessed to Daniel’s murder on camera to an undercover detective.

They are also not concerned with the precedent at the Canadian High Court, maintaining that international rulings ‘bear no relevance’ on proceedings in Australia.

In 2003 at the age of 13, Daniel, was abducted and murdered although his family did not know what had happened to him until his remains were uncovered in 2011 after a long police investigation and the family was able to lay him to rest. Bradley said of his twin this year, there had not been a day since that he hadn't thought of him . When Cowan was imprisoned, he had special food requests such as Coco Pops rejected, but in his cell he has his own TV, radio, toilet and shower. He will be kept in solitary confinement during his time inside purely for his own protection from prison inmates. In some cases, according to prison staff, Cowan requires high level escorts when he leaves his cell to guard him down the halls during weekly visits to the doctor. He visits a gym, a concrete room with a single sun-drenched window, which is the only time he ever gets to see life life outside. Bruce Morcombe said he knows Cowan would be doing it tough, and quite frankly, didn't care much for his treatment behind bars.

"Newlyweds Stacie and Edgar Cobos got more than they bargained during a game drive on their Serengeti Safari Camp in Northern Tanzania. The honeymooners, from Washington DC, were on a game drive when a cheetah got a little too close for comfort - jumping on the car and peering through the open sunroof. The couple had been happily observing the family of cheetahs when the big cats decided to use the car as a perch so they could get a better view of their surroundings. But one cheetah became more interested in the contents of the car than the surrounding plains, peering through the sunroof and, at one moment, looking like it may even try to get inside. As Edgar Cobos stayed stock still looking at the animal from the back seat, the big cat looked right back, before appearing to lose interest. Scroll down for video . Too close for comfort? One cheetah even popped his head into the vehicle through the sunroof . Edgar Cobos remained calm and cool while the gigantic cat lounged just inches from his head . The heart-stopping moment came as the newlyweds were enjoying a safari camp experience with The Luxury Safari Company. The trip involves travelling through the Serengeti with a mobile camp of just six tents, following the migration and wildlife movement around the Serengeti. Guests have the opportunity to camp and dine under the stars of the Kuka Hills in the North Eastern Serengeti, while always being positioned in an exceptional wildlife area. The nature of the safari means holidaymakers can venture further away from other tourists and often get much closer to the animals. The cats perched atop the car, enjoying a better view of the surrounding Northern Tanzania plains . The Serengeti has long been famed as one of the most beautiful, wild-life rich areas of Africa . Stumbling upon cheetah is nothing out of the ordinary in the Serengeti, which has long been famed as one of the most beautiful, wildlife-rich areas of Africa. In the North West region of Tanzania, it shares an invisible border with Kenya's Masai Mara, spanning 30,000 sq km. Aside from cheetah-spotting, wildebeest are also frequently seen, particularly during the country's annual wildebeest migration, which lasts for approximately 8-9 months of the year.

"January was the month for drastic action. Twice as many people as last year — 40,000 — signed up to a campaign organised by Alcohol Concern and gave up booze. Another 50,000 did the same via Cancer Research. Every woman I know has bought a juicer, is on a diet or has started some brutal new form of exercise or other. Our Prime Minister is running every other day to get rid of his festive flab. Even Pippa Middleton has signed up for punishing ‘hot yoga’ classes in London given by an extraordinary-looking chap with dreadlocks. But exercising, giving up carbs and shunning fast food and booze isn’t enough for some folk: according to people who monitor trends, the hottest form of self-improvement in 2015 involves stripping away non-essential clutter from our lives, and living with just the bare essentials instead. Janet Street-Porter took on board the advice given by James Wallman in his new book 'Stuffocation' with some interesting results . Devotees have been dubbed ‘experientalists’ — a horrible word which describes the knack of living through real experiences rather than accumu- lated possessions. A book entitled Stuffocation, Living More With Less, by James Wallman — an author and ‘trend forecaster’ — has just been published, and has attracted a lot of attention. Mr Wallman is an evangelist for this new lifestyle, claiming we will be happier and healthier if we bought less, chucked out or sold the stuff we never use, and spent our time enjoying life through doing things, either alone or with friends and family, rather than wielding our credit cards. Wallman claims not to be anti-consumerism, but advises that before every purchase, we must ask ourselves ‘Do I really need this? Will it make me happy or just bring debt and depression?’ — presumably when we can’t pay the bill. A book entitled Stuffocation, Living More With Less, by James Wallman, an author and ‘trend forecaster’ has attracted a lot of attention recently . He wants us to monitor our wardrobes every month and eliminate everything we haven’t worn. He’s very keen on expressions like focusing our minds ‘in the zone’. This ‘zone’ means living in the present, enjoying whatever activity you are doing to the full. Opting for adventure over repetition. Doing new things and enjoying new experiences, instead of just shopping. Travelling and broadening our horizons, learning new skills, instead of addictively purchasing stuff we don’t need. Wallman says there’s no such thing as retail therapy, advocating that we only purchase stuff we can use to achieve a life-enhancing goal, like a bicycle or a guitar. He reckons we’ve all accumulated so much detritus that it is suffocating us, hence the title of the book. In fact, the ‘living-with-less’ movement has been gathering steam for some time. It started in the U.S. and Canada, particularly among those who worked in the new tech industries, who believed that modern technology meant it was possible to live with much less stuff. These minimalists give away or trade all their possessions, apart from laptops, iPads, Kindles, a few items of clothing, and a mattress, and live in small rented flats. Hardcore minimalists — called Tech Nomads — say things like ‘the internet has replaced my need for an address’ and carry their belongings around in a backpack, sleeping on friends’ sofas. They claim that all they need is a hard drive and a change of pants. One man, Dave Bruno, even wrote a book entitled The 100 Thing Challenge, subtitled How I Got Rid Of Almost Everything, Remade My Life And Regained My Soul. Sounds tempting, doesn’t it? Achieving happiness through consciously chucking out or flogging off what we no longer need. Going for the simpler (and cheaper) life. Let’s face it, giving up booze, bread and bacon is a lot easier than giving up internet shopping. How many times have I come in late from supper, sat down at the laptop and bingo! bought a frock that will never go over my backside, a swimming costume that would fit an elf, a full set of DVDs I will never watch, or a floor-polishing machine than has never left the box because the instructions are incomprehensible. I’m a typical shopper, believing that every purchase is essential. Consumerism is worse than obesity, in its own way. It’s led the country to massive debt and depression. Survey after survey shows just how much unused stuff is clogging up our homes: women own an average of 25 pairs of shoes, five of which never get worn. They just sit in the cupboard looking sad. 'Tech Nomads' in the U.S. and Canada, believed that modern technology meant it was possible to live with much less stuff. These minimalists give away  all their possessions, apart from laptops, iPads, Kindles, a few items of clothing, and a mattress, and live in small rented flats . Two-thirds of us own kitchen gadgets that have only ever been used six times, and one in ten of all the items in our kitchens has never been used. From sandwich makers to slow cookers, these so-called ‘aids’ are just dust-collectors. When it comes to clothes, women have (on average) 22 items each they never wear, valued at almost £300 per person. Men are no better, hanging on to 19 items of clothing they’ve never worn. We buy clothes that don’t fit — and then delude ourselves that we will ‘slim’ into them. Ha ha ha. We waste money on impulse buys, and then kid ourselves they are being saved for a ‘special’ occasion. I bought an expensive silk dress because I liked the fabric, then had it altered because it made me look fat, and have never worn it because I still feel chubby in it. To be honest, that dress was cursed, it carried a death wish. Now, I’ve recycled it to a charity shop. Every time we buy clothes, we naively hope they possess magic properties — and will make us happier, look gorgeous, attract compliments, draw attractive people in our direction, and generally impart a feeling of well-being. No dress can do that, particularly one bought in a hurry or after a big lunch. A dress is a dress, it can only do so much — especially if you’re over 60 and a size 14. Janet says she doesn't think editing her life down to 100 items isn't realistic as she'd hate to give up her childhood toys like her Ken doll . The same false hopes and dreams apply to 99 per cent of my purchases, from brightly coloured sofas that turn out to be uncomfortable (but look so trendy) to self-improving books I never read — bought because the reviewer gave them five stars. So can I adopt this new minimalist mantra and avoid being suffocated by my stuff? At 68, I have certainly built up a sizeable collection, but I’m not sure I can be ruthless. I’ve got the living room down to the bare minimum — one sofa, one table, six chairs, no rug. Then my partner bought a cactus. Then he added another one. They ruin my pristine environment, the plant equivalent of a shedding dog, sitting in nasty saucers. My architect-designed kitchen is pretty lean and mean, but I forgot to specify a space for a bin, so a free-standing one ruins the whole effect, especially when an unsightly plastic bag pokes out of the top. My minimalism really goes to pot when you open a cupboard door in the bedroom. There’s not even room for one more dress. The wardrobes and shelves for sweaters and T-shirts are crammed. I went through the whole summer thinking I had no clothes (so I bought a couple of frocks) and then in November found all my much-loved old summer dresses packed in a suitcase in the boiler room. If I had to chuck out what I never wear — at gunpoint — I could run three charity shops for a week. As it is, I drop off two carrier-bag loads every other Saturday. This trait runs in the family, because when my mum died, I took 40 bags of mostly unworn clothes, still in their carrier bags (largely purchased by me because she was always moaning she never had anything to wear) to the charity shops of Llandudno. I have shoes I’ve never worn, like my purple suede Yves St Laurent brogues — a size too big. I’ve got a pink sequined cardigan that makes me look like a big fat fairy. There’s a halterneck black chiffon evening dress that shows every under-arm wrinkle. If I can purge my wardrobe of half its contents, then I will be happier, just as Mr Wallman predicts, but when I enter my office, it’s another matter. Filing cabinets and cupboards are full to bursting with more than 50 photo albums, half a century of diaries and notebooks, detailing every walk I’ve ever done. There are folders of all my love-letters, all my wedding and divorce certificates. I’ve kept my school swimming certificates, my life-saving medal, and my little award for growing a daffodil in the Fifties. I could never get rid of this ‘stuff’ — because it connects me to my past, reminds me how far I’ve come. It brings back memories of happy times and sad deaths. The idea of editing my entire life down to 100 items like the disciples of minimalism has suddenly hit the buffers. Unless one whole filing cabinet containing a lifetime of memories could be considered a single object. And what about my treasured Devil Bendy toy, who has come everywhere with me for years, and who sits by my computer cheering me up? Or my Ken doll and Teddy, purchased in the village jumble sale for £2 ages ago? Little objects that are worth their weight in gold. In my head I’m a minimalist, but when it comes to my heart, it’s another matter. Stuffocation: Living More With Less, by James Wallman (Penguin, £9.99)","For many, January is a time to start a new diet, re-vamp your wardobe and chuck out all the rubbish you never use .

"Visitors to this year's Turner Prize exhibition will be met with more than 90 minutes of film to watch - including one of an 'adult nature' and another featuring Marxist equations. Four artists - Duncan Campbell, Ciara Phillips, James Richards and Tris Vonna-Michell - have been shortlisted for the annual contemporary art prize. Curator Lizzie Carey-Thomas said visitors who do not like sitting through the whole of a film work do not need to watch the full one hour 34 minutes of film on display, she said, or they could 'come out very resentful'. Cardiff-born artist Richards, 31, is showing Rosebud (2013), his film which includes partially censored, erotic images from a book found in a Tokyo library. As well as scenes of puddles, a bird, and the contours of a fingertip, his black-and-white footage also features 'a head of elderflowers trailed lightly over lips, skin and genitals'. A still shot of James Richards' Rosebud film, which features censored and erotic images from a book found in a Tokyo library . As well as scenes of puddles, a bird, and the contours of a fingertip, the film shows 'a head of elderflowers trailed lightly over lips, skin and genitals' Three of the creations on this year's shortlist feature film. Pictured is James Richards' shortlisted creation,  Rosebud . A set of stills from another display by James Richards. Called The Screens (2013), it shows images from a theatrical make up manual . Pictured is a final piece of James Richard's work, called Untitled Merchandise (Dealers and Lovers) His footage is described as 'poetic meditations on the pleasure, sensuality and the voyeurism that is in the act of looking.' His film, which has prompted the gallery to warn visitors about the adult nature of some content, uses a 'range of emotional tone' to elicit an emotional response from the viewer, according to curator Ms Carey-Thomas. His second work, The Screens (2013), features slides from a manual on how to create make-up effects, such as wounds, bruises and blood, for the theatre. Three of the four artists shortlisted are showing film. Vonna-Michell's film Finding Chopin: Dans l'Essex, features salt marshes and the Essex coastline and is inspired by a French sound poet who spent part of his life in Essex, close to where the 31-year-old artist grew up. His other work, Postcript II (2014), is a slide installation based on a story about the artist's mother's childhood in post-war Germany. A Tate Britain gallery employee looks at Ciara Phillips' colourful and immersive shortlisted work called Things Shared (2014) The display is described as an immersive experience which feels like walking into a giant screenprint . Ciara Phillips is the only artist not to use film in this year's exhibition - her artwork exclusively uses prints. It is open to the public from tomorrow at the Tate Britain . Dublin-born Campbell's films - one of which lasts almost an hour - tackle African art and colonialism and equations from Karl Marx's Capital Volume 1. Ms Carey-Thomas said that all the shortlisted artists tackled a 'lack of fixed meaning' in the world around them in their work. The predominant use of film in the show responded to 'how we navigate the world increasingly through images', she added. 'The internet changed the way that we interact with each other. It's only natural that the artists respond to that.' Tris Vonna-Michell's display (pictured) shows a collection of pictures to accompany a film about his mother . He uses the display to recount his childhood and personal memories of the city of Berlin when he was growing up . Duncan Campbell's shortlisted works, which use film and video, tackle Marxism, colonialism and African art . Pictured is the film It for Others, by Duncan Campbell. It is one of three Turner Prize nominees this year to use film . Glasgow-based artist Phillips, 38, is the only artist not to use film in the exhibition - her installation Things Shared features prints. The Turner Prize, now in its 30th year, has a reputation for controversy. Previous winners have included Martin Creed's installation featuring a light going on and off and Grayson Perry's pots tackling subjects like death and child abuse. Art movement the Stuckists usually demonstrate against the exhibition but today they handed out leaflets saying that they would not be protesting 'due to the fact that the prize has sunk to a predictable and pathetic level of elitist repetition that is not worth bothering about'. The prize, awarded to an artist under 50 born, living or working in Britain, will be presented to a winner on December 1. The Turner Prize 2014 exhibition opens tomorrow at Tate Britain and runs to January 4 next year. In its 30-year history, the Turner Prize has never failed to shock and surprise. While it remains to be seen if this year's erotic images by James Richards will trigger any controversy, the award has a long and turbulent history with past finalists attracting heavy criticism and sparking impassioned debates about the meaning and definition of what is art. Tracey Emin's 1999 display titled My Bed has become one of the more famous pieces associated with the Turner Prize. The artwork, which did not win the prize but was named as one of the shortlisted works, was a recreation of the artist's messy bed as it lay surrounded by cigarette butts, dirty underwear and condoms. Tracey Emin's controversial artwork My Bed - which cemented her place among the top echelon of British artists . Emin said she created the artwork after a traumatic breakdown in a relationship and the candid and crude display divided critics. Despite not winning the prize, it remains perhaps the most seminal piece of artwork displayed in the history of the Turner Prize. My Bed was recently sold by art dealer Charles Saatchi - who had bought it for £150,000 in 2000 - in a private auction at Christie's. The mystery buyer paid £2.2million. Damien Hirst also ranks alongside Emin as one of the most heavily criticised artists involved with the Turner Prize. His displays featuring animals frozen in formaldehyde have attracted strong debate about the meaning of art and what can be considered an artistic creation, and what is simply a stunt designed to shock audiences. Damien Hirst's A Mother and Child Divided (pictured), showing a cow dissected in half, won the Turner Prize in 1995 . At the time, Hirst was was heavily criticised for perceived attempts to simply shock audiences but it has become one of the most famous British artworks of the 90s . He first hit the headlines in 1991 when his display The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living was shortlisted for the Turner Prize. The display featured a tiger shark, caught off the coast of Australia, frozen in formaldehyde with its jaws wide open. Although it was not named as winner, he soon claimed the prize for his 1995 creation A Mother and Child Divided. In much the same fashion, it showed a dissected cow, with all its insides bared, frozen in the formula.","This year's Turner Prize shortlist includes more than 90 minutes of video with three of the four shortlisted using film .

"A Texas woman whose four pit bulls got into her neighbors' backyard and killed their pet beagle is suing them for $1million. In a lawsuit filed this week, Emerald White claimed she was 'seriously injured' on October 27 by trying to stop the attack that occurred after her dogs found a hole in the fence which separated the two properties. She told the Galveston County district court that she suffered 'multiple serious bite and scratch-type injuries' trying to separate her dogs and the 10-year-old beagle. A Texas woman whose four pit bulls got into her neighbors' backyard and killed their pet beagle is suing them for $1million; pictured is a stock image of a pit bull . According to reports, Ms White has further complained that she's feeling  'conscious pain and suffering and now suffers also from fear, anxiety and trepidation' as a result of the 'unprovoked attack'. And she further alleges that Bailey's owner, Steve Baker, had 'failed to confine and restrict Bailey in a secure enclosure'. However, accounts of the incident report that Bailey was killed in his own backyard and that the injuries Ms Emerald had suffered were caused by her own dogs which had entered the neighbors unlawfully. Bailey's owner, Steve Baker, told The Daily News that everyone was telling him to sue White, but he decided not to because it wouldn't being Bailey back. Steve Baker said his beagle was 10-years-old and was a 'loyal companion' to the family and had been around his two daughters since they were newborns; pictured is a stock image of a beagle puppy . Police had declared Ms White's dogs were dangerous which was the only outcome he wanted. He 'couldn't believe' Ms White had taken legal action. Dangerous dogs must be registered with Texas City annually and anyone owning one must put up warning signs and have a fence at least six feet high. They are also required to have a $100,000 liability on the dogs. Mr Baker described his dog Bailey as a 'loyal companion' to the family and had been around his two daughters since they were newborns . He said that before the incident he had tried to replace parts of the fence to better safeguard his family and their pet.","Steve Baker's beagle was killed by his neighbors' four pit bulls .

"On the night a Sydney woman allegedly murdered her estranged partner he had pinned her brother to the ground and screamed, 'I'm going to get you', a court has heard. Jessica Silva is accused of stabbing James Polkinghorne, 28, up to five times outside her family home in Marrickville in Sydney's inner west on Mother's Day in 2012. The 24-year-old has pleaded not guilty to murder on the basis of self defence, with the Supreme Court hearing she had suffered years of abuse at the hands of her boyfriend of four years. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva is accused of stabbing James Polkinghorne, 28, up to five times outside her family home in Marrickville in Sydney's inner west on Mother's Day in 2012 . Silva cried on Monday as her trial heard recordings of a series of frantic phone calls she made to her brother Miguel in the hours before Mr Polkinghorne died. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr Polkinghore text Ms Silva on Mother's Day calling her a 'f---ing slut', saying she deserved to be raped and threatening to come over to smash up her parents' house. 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now,' Silva says in one call to her brother Miguel. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. On the night a Sydney woman allegedly murdered her estranged partner he had pinned her brother to the ground and screamed, 'I'm going to get you', a court has heard . The 24-year-old has pleaded not guilty to murder on the basis of self defence, with the Supreme Court hearing she had suffered years of abuse at his hands . When Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside the family home that night, Miguel told the court he was 'screaming and carrying on' and that his sister was afraid for her and her family's life. When Miguel went outside with his sister in an attempt to calm the situation, he alleged Mr Polkinghorne came quickly towards him. 'He tried to punch me. I think when I put my hand up, and he broke my finger,' Miguel added. Moments later, the two men were on the ground with Mr Polkinghorne on top, grabbing Miguel near his throat, the court heard. Jessica Silva reportedly used this knife to stab her ex-boyfriend to death . Mr Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . 'Was he screaming out, `I'm going to get you, you f***ing c*** ... I'm going to kill youse (sic)'?' defence barrister Gregory Scragg asked. 'Yeah,' Miguel replied. It wasn't until their father came outside to help wrestle Mr Polkinghorne to the ground that he saw blood everywhere and noticed the 28-year-old had a gash to his head, the court heard. This image shows the alleged drugs that were on Mr Polkinghorne on the night he died . Miguel said his sister was the only person he saw with a knife that night. She allegedly stabbed him four or five times to the back, shoulder and head and he died on the road while Miguel and Ms Silva's father restrained him. In the weeks before Mr Polkinghorne's death, Miguel told the court the 28-year-old had become increasingly paranoid from the drug 'ice'. 'The drugs had gotten to him really bad.' The trial continues.

"A lost chapter of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is to be revealed to coincide with book's anniversary . A lost chapter of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is to be revealed today – 50 years after Roald Dahl’s most famous book was published. In the missing section from the 1961 draft, mysterious confectioner Willy Wonka took children who won a tour of his factory to the Vanilla Fudge Room – only for the passage to be cut from the published version. But the unused chapter, which introduces two extra naughty characters – Tommy Troutbeck and Wilbur Rice – was found among Dahl’s papers after his death at 74 in 1990. Now, the Roald Dahl estate has released the chapter to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the novel in October. Dahl was drafting his first version of Charlie And The Chocolate factory when he published James And The Giant Peach in 1961 – but it was reportedly binned after his young nephew said it was rubbish. The draft section tells how penniless but kind-hearted Charlie Bucket – who in this version is accompanied to the factory by his mother rather than Grandpa Joe – visit Vanilla Fudge Mountain with the other children. Hundreds of men use picks and drills to work away at what Dahl called the ‘colossal jagged mountain as high as a five-storey building’ made of ‘pale-brown, creamy, vanilla fudge’. Dahl – who also wrote Matilda, The Fantastic Mr Fox and George’s Marvellous Medicine – told how huge chunks of fudge tumble down the mountain before being collected by cranes and dumped on to open wagons. But Tommy and Wilbur ignore Wonka’s warnings and jump on the wagons which enter a tunnel that leads to the Pounding and Cutting Room where the fudge is pounded by a huge machine and cut with knives. Unsurprisingly, nothing more is heard of the two boys. The chapter also reveals several changes made to the original draft before it was published in the US in 1964 and the UK in 1967. The 1961 draft was found among Roald Dahl's papers after his death at 74 in 1990 and has now been released . Two other children who did not make it into the book are mentioned – Augustus Pottle and Miranda Grope – and the Oompa-Loompas who work in the factory were first called Whipple-Scrumpets. When Dahl returned to the book after ignoring his nephew’s advice, his agent Sheila St Lawrence suggested it should have ‘more humour, more light Dahlesque touches throughout’, according to a biography. It is thought to have sold more than 30million copies in the UK.","Unused chapter introduces two naughty characters -Tommy and Wilbur .

"Smokers who litter the streets with cigarette butts will be given a £30 shopping voucher if they complete a stop smoking course and quit the habit. The vouchers will be given to anyone who is fined for dropping smoking-related rubbish - such as butts and empty cigarette packets - and then completes a course commissioned by the council. Those who successfully give up smoking will be able to redeem the taxpayer-funded vouchers at a number of popular high street shops including Debenhams and Boots. Penalty: Under the scheme, those caught dropping cigarette butts and packets will receive a fixed-penalty notice of £80 - reduced to £55 if paid in 10 days. They will then be invited to attend a stop-smoking course . A public health charity said that the scheme could 'boost the resolve' of those who are struggling to quit. But opponents to the pilot programme, which launches in the London borough of Wandsworth next month, have branded it as 'bizarre'. They argue that it is unfair to rewards those who litter - adding that the council's money could be better spent elsewhere. Resident Alex Gore, 30, said: 'It's barmy. What about those who don't drop litter or have quit smoking off their own back? 'The council would be better off providing more bins with ashtrays on top then doing a bonkers gimmick like this.' Writing on the council website, another resident Kim Willott said: 'Whilst its easy to blame the people who do it the council should provide more bins.' John O'Connell, Director for the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'This is utterly bizarre. Litterbugs are fined for the obvious reason that it costs money to clean up. Expensive problem: Wandsworth council said itaiming to reduce smoking by 3 per cent next year . 'Rewarding those who continue to do it is a strange brand of justice. The scheme is clearly open to abuse, and needs to be rethought "" Under the plans, those caught dropping cigarette butts and packets will receive a fixed-penalty notice of £80 - reduced to £55 if paid in 10 days. Offenders will be given the option of attending a stop-smoking course commissioned by the council and will be given the £30 upon completing the programme. A spokeswoman for charity Action on Smoking Health said: 'Most smokers want to quit so this incentive scheme could boost the resolve of those who are struggling to kick the habit. 'Combining the anti-litter initiative with helping people to stop smoking should be beneficial all round as it will save money and improve the health of those who succeed in quitting smoking.' Health spokesman Cllr Jim Maddan said: 'We know that 65 per cent of smokers want to quit, but often they don't know where to turn for help. This scheme will help them find that help. 'Stopping smoking is the single most beneficial thing anyone can do for their health. 'We won't force people to sign up for a stop smoking course, but we hope that this £30 voucher will encourage them to take the first step.' The vouchers are available at a range of shops Debenhams, HMV, River Island, House of Fraser, H Samuel, Habitat, Toys R Us, Homebase and Clinton Cards among others. The council handed out fines to 614 people for littering in 2013-14, around half for smoking-related rubbish. The borough said it spends £4million picking up 7,000 tonnes of litter from the streets every year. It is aiming to reduce smoking by 3 per cent next year and claims to have helped more than 6,500 smokers to quit since 2010.

"Scientists . have managed to 'reset' human  stem cells in a move which could lead to the development of cures for heart and eye diseases, . Parkinson's and stroke victims. In 'a major step . forward', British and Japanese  scientists said they had successfully rebooted stem cells so they were equivalent to those of a 7 . to 10-day old embryo, before it implants in the womb. By studying the reset cells, they said they hoped they would . now be able to learn more about embryo development, and how it . can go wrong and cause miscarriage and developmental disorders. Scientists have managed to 'reset' human stem cells in a move which could lead to the development of cures for heart and eye diseases, Parkinson's and stroke victims . 'These cells may represent the real starting point for . formation of tissues in the human embryo,' said Austin Smith, . director of the Britain's Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, who . co-led the research published in the journal Cell on Thursday. 'We hope that in time they will allow us to unlock the . fundamental biology of early development, which is impossible to . study directly in people,' he added. Human pluripotent stem cells, which have the potential to . become any of the cells and tissues in the body, can already be . made in a lab either from cells extracted from early-stage . embryos or from adult cells that have been induced, or . reprogrammed, into an earlier state. But, the researchers said, until now it has . proved difficult to generate human pluripotent stem cells that . are at an early enough, pristine stage, before they have started . changing. Instead, scientists have only derived cells that are . slightly further down the developmental pathway, not a totally 'blank slate', said Smith. Experts say that by helping to regenerate tissue, stem cell . science could offer new ways of treating conditions for which . there are currently no cures - including heart and eye diseases, . Parkinson's and stroke. The process of generating stem cells in the lab is much . easier to control in mouse cells, which can be frozen in a state . of very early pluripotency using a protein called LIF. Human . cells are not as responsive to LIF, so they must be controlled . in a different way that involves switching key genes on and off. In 'a major step forward', British and Japanese scientists said they had successfully rebooted stem cells so they were equivalent to those of a 7 to 10-day old embryo, before it implants in the womb . Smith said this was the main reason why scientists have been . unable to generate human pluripotent cells that are as primitive . and pristine as their mouse equivalents. To avoid this problem, the scientists introduced two genes - . NANOG and KLF2 - which caused a network of genes controlling the . cell to reboot and induce the early pluripotent state. Yasuhiro Takashima of the Japan Science and Technology . Agency, who worked with Smith, said the reset cells opened the . door to a new phase of research. 'We now need to carry out further studies to establish how . our cells compare with others,' he said. 'We don't yet know . whether these will be a better starting point than existing stem . cells for therapies, but being able to start entirely from . scratch could prove beneficial.' Chris Mason, a stem cell expert and professor of . regenerative medicine at University College London who was not . involved in this work, praised its results and implications. 'Having a source of pristine stem cells which can be . precisely changed into clinical-relevant cell types is a major . step forward,' he said in an emailed comment. 'The benefits could be safer and more clinically effective . cell therapies produced at lower cost - good news for patients . and healthcare providers.'","British and Japanese  scientists said they had successfully rebooted stem cells so they were equivalent to those of a 7 .

"Notorious inmate Charles Bronson has reportedly claimed  Ronnie Kray 'lived like a lord' inside Broadmoor - with a huge stash of cigarettes and even tins of salmon. The 61-year-old armed robber told a pen pal the secure psychiatric hospital, where he spent six years from 1978 to 1984 under his real name Michael Peterson, was like a 'f****** corner shop'. Violent hostage-taker Bronson has been in and out of jail for most of his life since the stint at Broadmoor - which nonetheless he hated and protested with an 18-day hunger strike. Friends: Charles Bronson (left in his younger days) said Ronnie Kray (right) lived like a lord in Broadmoor . Claims: Bronson is said to have described Broadmoor (above) as 'like a f****** corner shop' In a letter obtained by The Sun he is said to describe a life of luxury by East End gangster Kray, who he befriended at HMP Parkhurst before being reunited with him at Broadmoor. According to the newspaper, he told an unnamed 'pen pal': 'It was like a f****** corner shop. Ronnie was living the life of a lord. I'd never seen nothing like it. 'I'd just had a load of years in prison with nothing. All of a sudden I'm sitting there and eating tins of salmon.' He added Kray, then in his late 40s, had a comfortable stash of food and cigarettes. Bronson, who changed his name again to Charles Salvador earlier this year, is infamous for being one of Britain's most violent prisoners. Raised in Aberystwyth, west Wales, he began committing robberies aged 13 and has been held in solitary confinement for long stints totalling well over two decades since 1974. Notorious: Bronson, now Charles Salvador, has taken several prison staff hostage in violent incidents . Unrepentant: Bronson's violent past has not stopped him earning a string of pen pals and a marriage in jail . He was given a life sentence after holding a prison art teacher hostage in 1999 and has committed a string of violent offences since. His latest conviction was in September for taking hostage the governor of Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, and holding him in a headlock. Reggie Kray once described an encounter with him in jail as 'the most frightening visit I had'. But the violent inmate has his supporters, including an appeal fund which claims it is time for him to be released. He has struck up friendships with pen pals before, including in 2009 when he wrote a romantic string of letters to one-time actress and glamour model Gemini Reynolds. Under the spotlight: Broadmoor will soon be the subject of a book co-authored by Bronson . The Cyprus-based 50-year-old said at the time: 'He's not a monster in my eyes. I hope he gets downgraded and rehabilitated toward his freedom. There is no reason why he should not.' Bronson even  married  a pen pal inside prison in 2001, but he divorced Saira Rehman after four years and renounced her Muslim faith, to which he had briefly converted. He is now believed to have co-authored a book about Broadmoor, due for release next year. An organiser of his release fund  dismissed the remarks about Ronnie Kray - if true - as a likely 'throwaway comment in a confidential letter' and little more.","Notorious 61-year-old Bronson reportedly made claim in pen pal letter .

"Many people need a gentle nudge to exercise, and what better motivation than saving money on your electricity bills. That's the concept behind the Wheel washing machine and treadmill, created by South Korean designer Si Hyeong Ryu. He envisages a large hamster-style wheel fitted with rubber that captures kinetic energy as a person runs on it, and uses this to power other home appliances. The Wheel (pictured) was created by South Korean designer Si Hyeong Ryu for the 2014 Electrolux Design Lab competition. His concept collects kinetic energy generated by the treadmill, which is built into a large hamster-style wheel . It uses this energy to power washers built into the wheel, to churn water and wash clothes as well as light up a display. Realising at the last minute your favourite dress is dirty, or you don’t have a clean shirt for an important meeting could soon be a thing of the past. The Swash is a washing machine and iron in one that refreshes clothes, removes odours and flattens out wrinkles at the press of a button. Pods of liquid are sprayed directly onto the clothes, before a drier circulates air through the device, and a dirty item is ready to wear in just 10 minutes. Ryu created the concept for the 2014 Electrolux Design Lab competition. ‘Wheel is a crossover between gym bike and washing machine by using human kinetic power to save electricity and our nature,' said Ryu. ‘The power generated from the spinning can be used to wash clothes and the unused power can be savedas electricity in the future.’ The concept also features washing balls inside the canisters, designed to shorten the washing time and save water in the process. The power generated can be used to wash clothes and the unused power can be saved to a battery. The concept also features washing balls inside the canisters, designed to shorten the washing time and save water, solar panels to generate extra energy, and a flexible display (pictured) The concept design has been likened to a hamster on a wheel (stock image pictured) 'The treadmill mechanism helps the user for better work out experience and healthier life,’ continued Ryu. Elsewhere, the Wheel has a flexible display, which provides ‘a visual experience’ for the user - such as films or music videos. Solar panels also help absorb ‘solar energy from daylight’, and these panels can be a substitute energy source when the treadmill isn’t being used. Ryu is a product design graduate from Samsung Art and Design School and is now a freelance designer. The theme for this year's Electrolux competition was The Home of Tomorrow.","The Wheel was created by South Korean designer Si Hyeong Ryu .

"Pottery from Africa found in a burnt-out fortress in Galloway hints at a 'lost' Dark Ages kingdom that may even have been born of an alliance between Britons and Picts. Remarkably, a Pictish carved stone at the fort's entrance shows two entwined symbols which could have been evidence of an alliance between Britons and Picts, possibly through a ‘royal’ marriage. A shard of sixth century pottery from Africa also found at the site shows it could . only have been home to someone of ‘the very highest status’, like a . King. The Picts were a savage tribe who lived north of the Firth of Forth - very few Pictish stones have ever been found outside their traditional territory. A newly found spearhead dates from around that time, while sixth century pottery from Africa shows it could only have been home to someone of ¿the very highest status¿, like a King . Like Mel Gibson's ferocious warriors in Braveheart, the Picts were known for blue body-paint and a rather hostile attitude to southerners . Archaeologists are searching the site to solve the 200-year mystery of the Pictish carving. The stone has baffled historians because Galloway was inhabited by the tribe known as Britons. The Britons were a Celtic people who occupied much of Britain - but were fragmented after the Anglo-Saxon settlement in the 5th and 6th centuries AD. Further north were the Scots, with ‘Pictland’ further still, north of the Firth of Forth. The Pictish stone is one of only three known out of their traditional territory - the others being in known Dark Age capitals. Ronan Toolis of Guard Archaeology, who is leading the dig, said today/yesterday that the royal link could finally provide an explanation. He said: ‘It looks increasingly likely that this fortress was built in the Dark Ages, and occupied during the fifth to the seventh centuries AD. ‘The Pictish stone dates from that time, but the big question has always been what it was doing in Galloway. ‘We know of only two other similar carvings outside Pictland - at Dunadd in Argyll and on Edinburgh Castle rock, both of which were capitals of Dark Age kingdoms. The Pictish stone is one of very few found outside the tribe's traditional territory north of the Firth of Forth - and hints at a possible alliance between Picts and Britons in the Dark Ages . A spearhead from the burnt-out fort on Trusty's Hill, which archaeologists now think may have been the centre of a lost Dark Ages kingdom . Mel Gibson's blue face paint in Braveheart is a nod to the Pictish tradition of body-paint - but the real Picts fought stark naked, and there are records of them doing so up until the 5th Century. The Roman name for the people - Picti - means 'painted people'. It's not known what they called themselves. The habit of fighting naked, especially in the cold Scottish climate, didn't harm the tribe's reputation for ferocity. Picts held the territory north of the Firth of Forth in Scotland - and were one of the reasons even heavily armoured Roman legions could not conquer the area. It's long been debated how the Picts and their Southern neighbours the Britons interacted with one another. The discoveries in Galloway hint that the two might have allied, at least briefly - before the fort was burnt to the ground. ‘At Trusty's Hill we see a Z-rod and double disc which is a classic Pictish symbol. The other symbol on the stone is a fish monster with a sword, which is unique to this site. ‘It could be that we are seeing an alliance between the Picts and local Britons - two crests coming together, almost like a coat of arms.’Mr Toolis said the vital find was the African pottery, however. He said: ‘This pottery shard, which looks like part of the rim of a bowl, is African Red Slip Ware, which came from Carthage and dates to the sixth century AD. ‘It is very rare in British, let alone Scottish Dark Age sites - the early Christian monasteries at Whithorn and Iona being the only other Scottish sites we can think of. ‘It not only indicates that Trusty's Hill was inhabited at the same time as when one would expect the Pictish Carvings to have been made but it means that very high status people in post-Roman Scotland lived here. ‘We might be discovering the evidence to show that Trusty's Hill was a stronghold of the Dark Age Kings of Galloway. ‘It could even be further evidence that the Dark Age Kingdom of Rheged, thought to have been located somewhere between Wales and Ayrshire, may actually have been in Dumfries and Galloway.’Trusty's Hill was excavated in 1960, when vitrified stone - subjected to intense heat and effectively melted - was first identified. The fort had clearly been burnt down, possibly at the hands of a Northumbrian enemy.Mr Toolis said: ‘The fort was captured and destroyed. It would have burned in spectacular fashion, and the flames would have been seen miles away for days. ‘One known enemy of this area, who existed around the same time, was the Northumbrian known as Flamddyn, or Flame Bringer, which would certainly be an appropriate name.’","'Lost kingdom' occupied between 5th and 7th century AD .

"Easter Ross, a region in Scotland’s Northern highlands, is thought to have been a major heartland for the Pictish civilisation. Archaeologists have found mounting evidence of their extensive occupation with recent excavations uncovering a whale tooth and a preserved brooch.

"The parents of a 15-year-old girl who has a long history of medical problems have lost custody of her to a hospital. Justina Pelletier was diagnosed with mitochondrial disease, a genetic disorder that can cause loss of muscle coordination and weakness, several years ago. The teenager from West Hartford, Connecticut, however was able to live a normal life until coming down with the flu in February. 'Don't forget me': Justina Pelletier pictured in Boston Children's Hospital where she has been held against her will for nine months by doctors who believe she is suffering from a mental illness . The family are only able to visit 15-year-old Justina at the hospital (pictured) for one hour every week, and can speak only twice a week on the phone for 20 minutes at a time . Justina was admitted to Boston Children's Hospital to receive treatment from a specialist she has known since her diagnosis. Upon admission however a team of new doctors allegedly swooped in on the teen and came up with a different conclusion about her condition. They also cast doubt on whether she had ever had mitochondrial disease, suggesting she in fact suffering from . Somafotorm disorder - a psychological condition that manifests itself in . physical symptoms. After the conflicting diagnosis, doctors allegedly gave Justina's parents the heart-breaking news that they wouldn't be able to take their daughter home. Nine months after the incident. Mr and Mrs Pelletier remain embroiled in a bitter custody battle with the hospital who allow Justina so little time to see her family she has resorted to smuggling letters to them in origami artwork. 'This one’s in her artwork,' says Justina’s sister, Jennifer, pointing to a folded note. Justina has resorted to hiding handwritten notes to her family in origami artwork . Despite being diagnosed with the condition which can affect muscle coordination and mobility, 15-year-old Justina lived a normal life until being taken to Boston Children's Hospital in February . 'It's kidnapping': Justina's parents Lou and Linda Pelletier have been left embroiled in a bitter custody battle with the hospital . 'I know you trust in me. Don’t forget it. I love you more than . everything in the whole world. Justina,' Linda Pelletier reads from one . note. The Massachusetts Department of Children and Families allows Justina’s . parents just one hour-long visit per week and two twenty minute phone . calls. Before being taken to hospital after coming down with the flu in February, Justina enjoyed a normal life and was a keen ice-skater . Speaking . of the moment their daughter was taken away from her, the teenager's . mother said: ''They came in, and they said we cannot take Justina out of . the hospital. 'They called DCF (Department for Children and Families). 'They said Justina had 'somatoform disorder,' a form of mental illness that is characterized by physical symptoms.' Linda . and her husband Lou Pelletier were escorted out of the hospital by . security, and within the short space of four days they had lost custody . of their beloved daughter. 'It's beyond any wildest nightmare that you could think of,' said the teenager's father. 'It's kidnapping,' he told Fox CT. 'It's the most bizarre situation I've ever been involved with,' said Dean Hokanson, Justina's clinical psychologist. 'They were actually being accused of . being too active in pursuing healthcare matters for their child,' said Hokanson who has been involved with the Pelletier family for . five years. Now, the . family is locked into a bitter custody battle with the hospital that has . allegedly accused them of 'overmedicalizing' their child. Doctors at Boston Children's Hospital involved the Department of Children and Families after asserting Justina's parents were 'overmedicalizing' her . Justina was diagnosed with mitochondrial disease several years ago, a genetic condition that affects muscle coordination and mobility. The illness includes a group of neuromuscular diseases caused by damage to intracellular structures that produce energy. There is no cure for the condition that is progressive and can cause death. Symptoms can include weakness, intolerance for exercise, heart failure, dementia and rhythm disturbances. Every year 1,000 to 4,000 children in the United states are born with a mitochondrial disease. After being admitted to Boston Children's Hospital in February however doctors concluded the teenager was suffering from Somafotorm disorder, a psychological condition that causes sufferers to feel pain, although there is no physical cause for it. Sufferers do not feign the physical symptoms they feel, rather they present themselves as the result of mental strain. Doctors cannot identify the sources of patients' pain and instead prescribe antidepressants. Patients can become increasingly frustrated with the diagnosis as there is seemingly no explanation for their symptoms. Experts . estimate that between 0.2 and 2 per cent of females and less than 0.2. per cent of men in the US suffer from the condition. While the Pelletier family were able . to give their account before the court case began, the Department of . Children and Families and Boston Children's hospital could not comment . on the case following a judge's decision to prohibit public statements. A spokesperson for the DCF said the Department tried to 'abide' by the recommendations of doctors where possible . Internal discharge documents however reveal why the hospital may have felt inclined to involve child protection authorities. A report, written in April 2013 by one . of the hospital's staff states how doctors took Justina off many of the . medications she was taking at the time she was admitted. 'Due to concerns regarding Justina’s regressive behavior changes around her family, the multiple medical procedures and care episodes she has been through … and both parents’ resistance towards recommended treatment plans for Justina … a child protection team was convened,' it read. The Pelletier family however provided proof that every procedure and prescription in Justina's medical history was sanctioned by doctors, including Tufts Medical Center specialist, Dr Mark Korson. In an email to the family, the doctor wrote: 'I am dismayed... it feels like Justina's treatment team is out to prove the diagnosis at all costs... The team has demanded that Justina be removed from the home... This represents the most severe and intrusive intervention a parent can undergo... for a clinical hunch.' Dr. Amel Karaa of Massachusetts General Hospital, says conditions like mitochondrial disorder commonly lead to confusion for health care providers. She told Fox news: 'A lot of social cases have been reported where the children were taken away from their parents by social services and the hospital because the medical team thought that the parents were causing this to their child.' The Pelletiers continue to fight the hospital to regain custody of Justina. They will appear again in court on December 5.","Justina Pelletier was diagnosed with mitochondrial disease as a child .

"They are often depicted as dim-witted evolutionary losers, but Neanderthals were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains, a new study suggests. Instead, it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors, scientists believe. An analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years strips away some of the myths surrounding Neanderthals and reveals they were more advanced and sophisticated than has widely been thought. Why did Neanderthals go extinct? It's often thought their lack of intelligent ultimately led to their demise, but new research suggests it may instead have been due to interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors . The differences between the two human sub-species are not enough on their own to account for the demise of the Neanderthals, say the two US and Dutch researchers. Dr Paola Villa, from the University of Colorado Museum, and Professor Wil Roebroeks, from Leiden University, wrote in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE: 'Genetic studies now suggest that the debate on the demise of the Neanderthals needs to be reframed in terms of some degree of interbreeding. 'In that sense, Neanderthals did not go extinct, even though their distinctive morphology did disappear. 'We conclude that all the ""archaeology-based"" explanations for the demise of the Neanderthals... are flawed.' Neanderthals thrived in Eurasia for 300,000 years but vanished around 40,000 years ago as early modern humans began to settle in Europe. In the past, experts have theorised that Neanderthals died out because they were mentally, technologically and culturally inferior to the newcomers and unable to compete for limited resources. But more recent evidence has shown that Neanderthals made effective tools and weapons, wore ornaments such as eagle claws, used ochre and pitch, ate plants and fish as well as big game and created organised living spaces in their caves. In many cases this was happening before the arrival of modern humans, so the behaviours could not have been copied from them. Reviewing the evidence, the scientists pointed out that 200,000 years ago Neanderthals were using fire to produce pitch from tree bark. Experiments showed that the process required high temperatures and an oxygen-free environment such as an enclosed pot, suggesting a high level of technical knowledge. Evidence of the Neanderthals and early humans mixing can be seen in the fossil record. Some human-like characteristics have been found in late Neanderthal fossils, and conversely, Neanderthal features have been seen in early specimens of modern humans in Europe . Neanderthal DNA, which was sequenced in 2010, shows clear evidence of interbreeding, the researchers add. Neanderthals and early modern humans are most likely to have interbred in Europe and the Middle East around 50,000 years ago. Today Neanderthal inheritance is estimated to make up between 1% and 4% of the DNA of people outside Africa. Interbreeding could be one reason why Neanderthals vanished, according to the scientists. They were not so much driven to extinction as assimilated. Evidence of the two mixing can be seen in the fossil record. Some human-like characteristics have been found in late Neanderthal fossils, and conversely, Neanderthal features have been seen in early specimens of modern humans in Europe. Neanderthals were more robust and much stronger than modern humans, with a backward sloping chin and forehead. It is possible that interbreeding with Neanderthals may have helped our ancestors survive outside Africa, say the scientists. On the other hand some Neanderthal genes may have contributed to sterility, which is why so few remain. The researchers wrote: 'The Neanderthal demise appears to have resulted from a complex and protracted process including multiple dynamic factors such as low population density, interbreeding with some cultural contact, possible male hybrid sterility and contraction in geographic distribution followed by genetic swamping and assimilation by the increasing numbers of modern immigrants.' Europeans may be closer to their Neanderthal cousins than previously thought, new research suggests. Breeding with Neanderthals has long been known to have left its traces in the DNA of modern Europeans. Scientists . in Edinburgh have now confirmed that the genetic similarity between the . two must have arisen after interbreeding in Europe and Asia, before our . ancestors spread across the globe. Previous . research speculated that modern Europeans and Asians are related to . Neanderthals because they originated from a similar sub-population in . Africa. Both groups evolved from a common ancestor in Africa before spreading to other parts of the world. The . two groups emerged at different times with Neanderthals leaving the . African continent more than 200,000 years before humans did. Now . scientists at the University of Edinburgh and Wageningen University . found the species mated in Europe and Asia thousands of years ago. The . research involved dividing up the genetic code of each sub-species to . calculate the statistical likelihood of distant or recent interbreeding. They . traced the biological ties that exist between humans and the ancient . species which are believed to have died out around 30,000 years ago. The research found that the two per cent of neanderthal DNA which exists in people today came from the mating outside of Africa.","Two researchers have suggested that Neanderthals never went extinct .

"Sandia researcher Mark Boslough shows the fine points of the 'fireball' that might be expected from an asteroid exploding in Earth's atmosphere, as indicated in a supercomputer simulation . A meteor that exploded over Russia was 30 times brighter than the sun, with the force of 40 Hiroshima atom bombs, said scientists. Their analysis confirmed the meteor crash was the biggest in a century. They also warned it was a wake-up call for humanity about the increased threat of space rocks smashing into the Earth. The 62ft-wide missile exploded in a fireball above the city of Chelyabinsk on February 15, causing damage up to 50 miles away. At its fastest, it was travelling at more than 40,000mph. According to experts, combining the recent Chelyabinsk crash with the 1908 Tunguska explosion over Siberia and the 1963 Bolide blast off the coast of South Africa, data suggests that the rate of small space rocks entering our atmosphere is actually much higher than previously thought. Speaking at at the American Astronomical Society's 2013 Division for Planetary Sciences meeting, Mark Boslough, a physicist at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, explored the implications of the Chelyabinsk airburst event, which happened on October 7 this year. ‘These three data points together suggest that maybe we have underestimated the population of smaller sized objects that can create air bursts,’ said Dr Boslough. ‘We think the airburst hazard is greater than previously thought,’ he added. The 1963 Bolide blast was a 1.1-megaton explosion picked up by a global network of infrasound sensors, but not apparently seen by any observers. Scroll down for videos . This space rock blew apart 18.5 miles above the city of Chelyabinsk, briefly outshining the sun and inflicting severe burns on a number of observers below. It was the largest object to hit the Earth since the Tunguska event of 1908, when an exploding comet or asteroid destroyed 2,000 square kilometres of Siberian forest . The explosion of a previously undetected asteroid about 25 miles from the Russian city of Chelyabinsk, led to widespread blast damage, Space.com reported. According to the University of California, the space rock blew apart 18.5 miles above the city, briefly outshining the sun and inflicting severe burns on a number of observers below. But it has also spurred a wealth of data helping scientists to gauge the object's size, angle of entry and other specifics, Dr Boslough said. He estimates the explosive yield of the most recent space rock was at 400 to 500 kilotonnes, making it the most powerful event since Tunguska. The impact site of the main mass of the Chelyabinsk meteorite in the ice of Lake Chebarkul . 2000 EM26's flyby is almost exactly a year after a meteor unexpectedly exploded above Chelyabinsk, Russia, causing damage and injuring more than 1,000 people with falling glass . A naturally-occurring air burst arises from the explosion of incoming meteors, which explode in the air and not on the ground. Examples include the Tunguska event, the Curuçá River event and the Chelyabinsk meteor event. The term also refers to the detonation of an explosive device such as a nuclear weapon in the air. The principal military advantage of an air burst over a ground burst is that the energy from the explosion  is distributed more evenly over a wider area. The Chelyabinsk meteor, which measured around 20 metres in diameter with a mass of 12,000 tonnes, exploded just 30km above the ground. Fortunately, the meteor came in at an angle to spread its energy sideways, creating less damage on the ground. Peter Brown, a physics professor at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, has collected over 500 videos of the event which injured around 1,500 people as glass windows shattered in the post-explosion shockwave. Dr Boslough believes taking cover on the ground and staying away from windows is the best course of action in the event of another similar occurrence. Writing in journal Acta Astronautica, he predicts the next destructive Near Earth Object (NEO) event will be an airburst and has suggested an outburst warning system should be used to deal with the threat. Three data points suggest that scientists have underestimated the population of smaller sized objects (such as meteors) that can create air bursts. An illustration of an asteroid headed towards Earth is illustrated . U.S. government sensors also documented the Chelyabinsk event and released the data captured to the scientific community. Commenting on another expert's concerns that an air burst could he misinterpreted as a preemptive attack from another country, Dr Boslough said he thought the worries were exaggerated before he watched a number of Chelyabinsk event videos. 'Say that this had happened on an overcast day, where nobody actually saw the streak across the sky. Then you see smoke, hear a large explosion and a lot of things that sound like artillery fire. 'Then imagine it's over a place that's already politically unstable. One of the biggest threats could be that this might lead to a counterattack of somebody because something was misconstrued,' he said.","U.S. physicist Mark Boslough said collisions from outer space could cause more damage than nuclear explosions .

"Emperor Nero: History has painted him as a cruel leader, but the poem romanticizes his life . An ancient Greek poem praising the wife of the infamous Roman emperor Nero has been discovered in an Ancient Egyptian town. The poem treats Poppaea Sabina, the wife of the cruel leader, as a goddess - describing her ascending into the heavens and painting a touching portrait of the couple. Due to the lettering style, researchers believe the poem was written around AD300 - two hundred years after Nero's death, leaving a mystery as to why someone more than 1,400miles from Rome would wish to write a tribute so many years later. Nero has gone down in history as one of Rome's most cruel, depraved and megalomaniac rulers, often indulging in orgies and blamed for a devastating city fire which allowed the emperor to rebuild the city to his own tastes. Poppaea was also criticised at the time. When, according to ancient records, Nero killed his first wife Octavia, Poppaea was said to have been presented with her head. She then convinced Nero to commit matricide and was, according to the records, the real power behind the throne. But the poem sees Poppaea in a different light, with the goddess Aphrodite welcoming her to the stars, telling her: 'my child, stop crying and hurry up: with all their heart Zeus' stars welcome you and establish you on the moon...' The poem was discovered 100 years ago - but was only recently translated. Two excavators, Bernard Grenfell and . Arthur Hunt, found hundreds of thousands of scrolls in ancient city . dumps in Oxyrhynchus in Egypt. The town had a population of around . 10,000 at the time of the Romans, and the papyri contained thousands of . records and details of life in the era. A tribute to Nero and Poppeae: The poem, written on two sides of the newly deciphered papyrus . The . process of translating is still continuing years down the line and the . team, according to Live Science, did not know what to expect other than . the scroll contained a poem in Greek text. It turns out the poem, in early history's answer to Romeo and Juliet, shows Poppaea lamenting over her lost lover. According to Live Science the poem reads: '[S]he was downcast and did not rejoice in the offered (favour). For she was leaving her husband, (a man) equal to the gods, and she moaned loudly from her longing...' Poppaea then ascends to the stars, crossing the planets then known to mankind, including 'the . Cyllenaean star' (Mercury), 'belt of the Aegis-bearer' (Jupiter) and 'Rhea's bedfellow' (Saturn). When she arrived 'under a clear (moon), the dance of the blessed (gods) she . viewed'. Then, she went out alone into the darkness of the North Pole, 'looking around for her husband under the darkness...' Where in the world? Oxyrhynchus, near Cairo, is more than 1,400miles from Rome . Theories about the range from the suggestion that it was originally composed in the time of Nero and was retold over the next 200 years before being written down in Egypt, to this being a poem written about an Egyptian officials death, which used Nero and Poppaea as an example of star-crossed lovers. Paul Schubert, a professor at the University of Geneva, who led the research, said it was possible such poems were written for members of the Roman imperial family after they . died. He said: 'There is a possibility that the poem we have here recovered . actually belongs to this lost genre, but we can't be sure.' Emperor Nero was the fifth and final Roman Emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and inherited the throne and the title Caesar from his adoptive uncle Claudius. The notorious emperor reigned from 54 to 68 AD, and his name was a byword for dissolution, cruelty and excess. n 64AD two-thirds of Rome was destroyed in a great fire and Nero famously rebuilt the city after the fire in the Greek classical style, including his lavish Golden palace. Rome burns; History tells us Nero sat playing his fiddle while Rome burned to the ground . Described by Suetonius as one of Rome's most cruel, depraved and megalomaniac rulers, Nero often indulged in orgies. Fancying himself an artist, he entertained guests at his palace with his own performances of poetry and songs . However Nero did not enjoy the frescoed halls and gold-encrusted ceilings for too long. It was completed in AD 68 - the year he committed suicide after his legions and bodyguards rose against him and the senate declared him a public enemy. Many Romans at the time believed the fire and ensuing destruction had been a ploy for the emperor to indulge his aesthetic tastes, despite his having been at his villa in Antium, 56km away, at the time. The stories tell of Nero unconcernedly playing the fiddle while the city burned. He blamed the Christians, then a minority sect, for the fire, and persecuted them. Early Christian tradition holds Nero responsible for the deaths of the Apostles Peter and Paul. After Nero's suicide, the palace was stripped of its marble, jewels and ivory, and within a decade the site was filled in and built over. It was eventually rediscovered in the 15th century after a local fell through the ground and into the remains of the structure. Within days people were letting themselves down on ropes so they could admire the frescoes that remained,  among them artists Raphael and Michelangelo who carved their names on the walls.","Poem was found in a city dump 1,400 miles from Rome along with thousands of other scrolls .

"History lessons will be rewritten to include 200 key figures, such as Winston Churchill, and events which shaped Britain under a new national curriculum drawn up by education secretary Michael Gove. The current syllabus, previously attacked for being too politically correct, will be scrapped with the intention of giving children a deeper understanding of history. Under new plans school children will learn a narrative about British history and key international developments, including the fall of the Roman Empire, the union that created Britain and the decline of its power. Sir Winston Churchill will be among the key figures from British history that school children will learn about in history . Winston Churchill and Anglo-Saxon monarchs Alfred and Athelstan will also be put on the list of leaders that children will study. Gove’s blueprint rejects learning by rote, but emphasises that acquiring a detailed knowledge of history will enable children to understand the reasons behind human failures and achievements, The Sunday Times reported. Secondary school children aged between 11 and 14 will move on to 50 wider topics about the modern world, including Soviet-U.S. relations and how they shaped the world, as well as the influence of immigration on British society. The national curriculum review was launched in January 2011 but only drafts in primary school maths, English and science have been released. The new primary and secondary . curriculum documents currently being considered cover art and design, . citizenship, English, geography, history and physical education. The drafts of the new national curriculum for primary and secondary schools was launched in January 2011 . Headmistress . of North London Collegiate school Bernice McCabe, co-director of the . Prince’s Teaching Institute and member of the committee advising on the . curriculum review, told The Sunday Times: ‘It is not a backward-looking . curriculum but very forward-looking. ‘Teachers from the Prince’s Institute . have said over the years that there has been a move too much towards . skills without sufficient emphasis on the knowledge that you need to use . them. ‘In history, for . example, we do not see how you can have a good foundation of knowledge . without understanding the chronology of events.’ The . current version of citizenship, which includes topics such as . identities and diversity and how to negotiate, plan and take action has . been cut back from 29 pages to one for 11 to 14-year-olds. The new syllabus will focus on the British monarchy and parliamentary democracy as well as theories on liberty and rights. In geography, primary children will . study physical features, the nature of rocks, rivers and mountains, the . names of countries and the characteristics of countries as well as how . glaciers shape landscapes. Co-director of the Prince’s Teaching Institute, Bernice McCabe, left, said the drafts are 'forward-looking' and right, physical education lessons will now focus on the need for physical exertion . Later on in secondary school the topics will become more specific, including aspects of human geography, like the industrial expansion of Asia. Alan Kinder, chief executive of the Geographical Association, advising on the review, told The Sunday Times: ‘ There is concern that pupils…don’t seem to be acquiring the world knowledge that we would expect them to have and most people in the geography subject community feel there needs to be something of a rebalancing.’ It follows criticisms of the current curriculum for failing to ensure children learn about human and physical processed which shape geography. The PE curriculum is now expected to emphasise the need for physical exertion, amid concerns the current programme requires too little fitness. The education department refused to comment on the drafts but said they will be made public 'in due course'.","Drafts of the new history curriculum focus on giving children a deep knowledge of events and key figures .

"This is the spectacular moment that scores of hot air balloons lifted off the ground at a massive festival in central Mexico. Crowds of over 400,000 gathered to watch as nearly 200 balloons took to the sky over the city of Leon on Saturday. They included a variety of colours and recognisable shapes such as Mickey Mouse, SpongeBob SquarePants and a killer whale. Full of hot air: Dozens of balloons took to the skies at the International Balloon Festival in Mexico . But the most appropriate was possibly a balloon shaped like an alarm clock as most spectators arrived early to ensure they had a prime position to watch the 13th International Balloon Festival of Leon. One of the balloons had a close call at one point as its basket briefly dipped into a lake. Attended by hot air balloon pilots from over 15 countries, the International Balloon Festival is currently the biggest of its kind in Latin America. The festival, founded in 2002, began with only 27 balloons. Put your hands in the air: SpongeBob SquarePants was among the recognisable characters in the sky . It provides a major boost for local businesses in Leon and event organisers claim that hotels in the region were at full occupancy over the weekend. 'This is a big event, a massive event,' said Leon Tourism Secretary Manuel Lopez. 'This year we are expecting 430,000 visitors, with an economic gain of some 500 million pesos (approximately £23,575 or $36,887).' Killer turnout: Organisers say they were expected 430,000 visitors for the four-day event . Close call! One of the hot air balloons almost went down, even dipping into a lake at one point . The first manned hot air balloon flight occurred in 1783, reaching an altitude of 3,280ft (one kilometre). Almost 50 years later in 1842, Don Benito Leon Acosta and Rubi de Celis, born in nearby Guanajuato City, took to the skies in a hot air balloon - the first time an aircraft ever flew over Mexico.","Up to 200 hot air balloons took to the sky over the city of Leon .

"His image has been replicated countless times in churches and artwork, but a team of Spanish archaeologists believe they have found one of the earliest images of Jesus. A mysterious underground room dating from between the sixth and seventh century AD holds an image of a young man with curly hair, who appears to be giving a blessing among other Coptic images. The Catalan experts who discovered the site in the ancient Egyptian city of Oxyrhynchus think it was the final resting place for a writer and a number of priests. Scroll down for video . A miraculous discovery! An underground room dating from the sixth century holds an image of a young man with curly hair, who appears to be giving a blessing (pictured) and one expert thinks it could be one of the earliest paintings of Jesus Christ. The image, which is seen here, has been protected from the sun with a thin layer of material . The structure dates from between the sixth and seventh century AD in the Coptic period and holds what could be an image of Jesus. It shows a young man with curly hair, dressed in a short tunic and with his hand raised as if giving a blessing . The room is thought to be a tomb for a writer and several priests, based upon artefacts found inside it, including a metallic ink well. It lies in what was the ancient city of Oxyrhynchus on a processional route between the Nile and a temple dedicated to Osiris - the ancient Egyptian god of the underworld . There is another mysterious structure closeby, linked with a flight of well-worn steps, which experts think might be another temple. The find has been heralded as ‘exceptional’ by Josep Padró who is leading the exhibition and said the figure accompanies symbols and images of plants that are thought to date from the Coptic period of the first Christians. Dr Padró, Emeritus Professor at the University of Barcelona, told La Vanguardia newspaper that the figure is that of ‘a young man with curly hair, dressed in a short tunic and with his hand raised as if giving a blessing.’ ‘We could be dealing with a very early image of Jesus Christ.’ Archaeologists are now working to translate inscriptions surrounding the figure in the painting on the wall of the rectangular crypt in a bid to ascertain the man’s identity. The underground structure measures around eight metres long and four metres deep. Experts from the University of Barcelona, the Catalan Egyptology Society and the University of Montpellier are also unsure of what the function of structure originally was, but said that the underground stone structure is ‘excellent’ quality. Ancient centre: The Catalan experts who discovered the site in the ancient Egyptian city of Oxyrhynchus (marked on the map) think it was the final resting place for a writer and a number of priests . Tools of the trade: The team of archaeologists also found working tools of a scribe that were buried in the tomb. They include a metallic ink pot which is still full of ink and two new pens for the pens (pictured) for the deceased to write during the eternal life . They also found working tools of a scribe that was buried in the tomb. They include a metallic ink pot which is still full of ink and two new pens for the pens for the deceased to write during the eternal life. Dr Padró said: ‘The archaeological site of Oxyrhynchus is known for the thousands of papyri found there, but any scribe was found to date.’ While there were no inscriptions hinting at the identity of the deceased, the remains show that the scribe was probably around 17 year’s old and lived during the Coptic Roman period. Archaeologists and engineers had to move around 45tonnes of rock to get to the hidden artwork and another unidentified structure close by, which is connected to the tombs by a set of very worn steps is currently being investigated. Gateway to the afterlife? The underground structure is situated in the middle of what was a processional route joining the Nile with the Osireion - the temple dedicated to Osiris - which is one of the greatest findings of Oxyrhynchus. The god is pictured in this painting in theTomb of Pashedu in Luxor, Egypt alongside  - Orus, the hawk god protector of Osiris . No-one is sure of what lies inside it, but experts from the University of Barcelona think it might be a temple, perhaps dedicated to god Serapis - the Hellenistic form of Osiris who is the ancient Egyptian god of the afterlife. The structures are situated in the middle of what was a processional route joining the Nile with the Osireion, the temple dedicated to Osiris, which is one of the greatest findings of Oxyrhynchus. Egypt's Minister of Antiquities, Mohamed Ibrahim, has become personally involved with the excavation, The Local reported. The Egyptian ministry will develop the archaeological site to preserve the early Christian artwork. A tomb full of Roman mummies was also found during the excavation.","Underground room from sixth century holds an image of a young man with curly hair, who appears to be giving a blessing .

"When Botox became available as a beauty treatment six years ago it was hailed by many as nothing short of a miracle. A-listers . such as Simon Cowell, Nicole Kidman and Sharon Osbourne have all admitted . to trying the popular treatment that promises to turn back time in just . one session. But no matter how safe Botox claims to be, the thought of having purified botulinum toxin injected into your face isn't exactly tempting. Now one revolutionary new product claims to be a no-toxin alternative that will freeze your wrinkles away instantly. Frotox: Hailed as the next generation Botox, a new procedure called iovera promises to freeze away wrinkles . iovera, or ‘Frotox’ as it has been . nicknamed, is a toxin free wrinkle treatment designed to deliver . immediate results with nothing left behind in the body. Developed by a California-based medical technology group called myoscience, it temporarily treats horizontal and vertical forehead lines and wrinkles by administering two cold 'shots' into each temple. The treatment, which has been hailed the next generation of Botox, uses a technique called . cryoneuromodulation to banish fine lines and now it is available in the UK for the first time at a Harley Street clinic. The 15-minute procedure involves placing . a device filled with liquid nitrogen next to the nerves that control . the muscles that cause wrinkles. An intense cold shock puts the nerve into ‘hibernation’ for up to four months, so muscles relax and wrinkles disappear. It . claims to be the perfect answer for needle-phobes due to its quick . procedure and the fact that only a closed-end needle is used, and . patients are said to experience the feeling as pressure rather than . cold or pain. It also maintains that it can target . nerves very precisely which means expressive muscles can still move to . make facial expressions . Big claims: Frotox claims to be the perfect answer for needle-phobes due to its quick procedure and patients are said to experience the feeling as pressure rather than cold or pain. Dr Yannis Alexandrides (right) is one of the first physicians in the UK to be trained in and offer the new iovera toxin-free wrinkle treatment . ‘The liquid nitrogen freezes the . targeted nerves on the forehead and between the brows,’ says Harley . Street plastic surgeon Dr Yannis Alexandrides, who has been trialling . and refining the procedure developed by  the California-based lab for more than a year. ‘This puts the nerves into temporary hibernation, so muscles relax and wrinkles disappear. ‘Unlike Botox, which takes four days to . work, the effects can be seen immediately and last for up to four . months. And as nitrogen occurs naturally in the body - unlike Botox - . you aren’t putting a foreign substance in to your system.’ But does it actually work? ioverao uses Focused Cold Therapy which uses the power of cold for the application to precise targets. Highly pressurised liquid nitrous oxide (liquid cold) travels at very high speeds down a fine 27G closed-end needle. At the needle tip it changes phase into gaseous form which draws in heat energy from the surrounding tissue to form a precise zone of cold. Initial trials showed that all testers had fewer wrinkles after treatment. Dr. Raina Zarb Adami, from Aesthetic Virtue, Harley Street, said: 'The . effect is immediate but you can’t grade the response as far as I know. 'To . my knowledge it is been used mainly in forehead lines with the entry . point close to the temple. It certainly looks promising.' Dr. Vincent Wong, Advanced Medical Aesthetics Practitioner & Aesthetic Medicine Trainer, who also carries out the procedure added: 'Iovera is the world's first toxin-free anti-wrinkle treatment - It's a unique stand-alone treatment in its own right and shouldn't be compared side-by-side with Botox or any botulinum toxins. 'Instead, we should think of it as an additional option available to people, especially those who do not want botulinum toxin injections or cannot have them due to medical reasons.' However, youth doesn't come cheap and while Frotox differs from Botox in many ways, they have similar price tags. A 15-minute session will set you back £300. And while the beauty world is buzzing about the latest anti-ageing procedure, not everyone is convinced.Dr Dennis Wolf, Joint Medical Director at The Private Clinic on Harley Street, said: 'Cryotherapy, which is what so called Frotox is, is where you freeze the nerves in the face in an effort to remove wrinkles. 'There is some degree of uncertainty with this procedure, as it is delivered in the hope that the right nerves can be hit to achieve the desired result. In my opinion the procedure is, therefore, far less predictable than Botox. 'Botox has been around for more than 30 years so medical practitioners, as well as most consumers, are aware that it is a safe and effective method. 'We are also aware of the potential side effects involved in its administration. It is my opinion that more studies into the long term effects and potential benefits of Frotox are needed before we can consider this a safe, viable alternative to Botox. 'Botox remains the best option to reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles – it is predictable, safe and repeatable.'","iovera, or ‘Frotox’,  is a toxin-free wrinkle treatment .

"Leader: Sufyan Ben Qumu, who has known extremist ties, became one of the top commanders of rebel forces in Benghazi . A former al-Qaeda terrorist released from Guantanamo Bay is believed to be the leader of the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including the US Ambassador, it was revealed on Wednesday. Sufyan Ben Qumu, who was reportedly once Osama bin Laden's driver, was let out of the US military detention center in Cuba in 2007 and turned over to the government of Muammar Gaddafi on the condition he be kept behind bars. Now, Fox News . reports he may have led the September 11 attack on the American . consulate that resulted in the death of John Christopher Stevens -- the . first US Ambassador killed by violence overseas since 1979. The . US military characterized him as a 'medium to high' risk to national . security while he was in US custody and he refused to cooperate with . authorities and explain his past associations with Islamic extremists. Qumu, 53, is a Libyan army veteran . who was jailed by Qaddafi and later escaped and moved to Sudan, where he worked . for one of Osama bin Laden's holding companies. According to some reports, he was bin Laden's driver during his time at the company. However, he denies this. He also fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan with the Mujaheddin. Later he took up arms against the Northern Alliance and fought alongside the Tabliban. Later, . he moved to Pakistan and slipped across the border into Afghanistan, . where he began working at a charity that was a front for al-Qaeda in the . summer of 2001. He was arrested in Pakistan by local . authorities shortly after the US invasion of Afghanistan. He was taken . to the Guantanamo Bay detention center and held there for six years. Scroll down for video . Attack: The US embassy in Benghazi was raided on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks . Deadly: Four people died, including US Ambassador Christopher Stevens, during an assault on the US Consulate in Benghazi, Libya . Despite his lengthy association with extremists, including the 9-11 mastermind and al-Qaeda leader himself, the military recommended in a 2005 report sending him back to his home country of Libya. In 2007, Qumu was released from Gitmo and turned over to Gaddafi on the condition that he be kept in prison. But, in 2010 Gaddafi freed him from . the notorious Abu Salim prison in Tripoli, along with 37 other . prisoners, to celebrate the dictator's 41st year in power. During the uprising, Qumu emerged as a leader of the rebels. He was a tank driver during his time in the Libyan army, though he had been arrested several times on drug and alcohol offenses. Tragic: John Christopher Stevens is the first US Ambassador to be killed by violence overseas since 1979. He apparently died of smoke inhalation after the attack on the consulate in Benghazi . Victims: Sean Smith (left), 34, was a foreign service computer expert who had previously been posted to Baghdad. Glen Doherty, 42, was a former US Navy SEAL who was working as a private security contractor . The report came as a senior US official called the assault on the American diplomatic outpost a 'terrorist attack.' It . was the first time the White House has referred to the deadly incursion . as terrorism and it undermines the US position that it was . 'spontaneous.' 'Yes, they . were killed in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy,' Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Matt Olsen told a . Senate hearing on Wednesday. Wrecked: The consulate was badly damaged in the attack that forced US personnel to flee . Extremists: The Libyan government blamed the attack on Islamic extremists angry over the release of a trailer for an American anti-Islam movie . In addition to Mr Stevens, who friends said devoted his life to promoting peace and cultural understanding, three other Americans were killed when a mob attacked and burned the consulate in former rebel stronghold city. Sean Smith, a foreign service officer, was a 34-year-old father of two. Glen Doherty, 42, was a former US Navy SEAL who was working at the consulate as a private security contractor. The attack on the consulate came after the release of a trailer for the controversial movie 'The Innocence of Muslims,' which paints a portrait of Islam that many in the Muslim world find deeply offensive. Destruction: The White House has now named the attack an act of terrorism . Protests: Unrest remains high in Libya after the release of 'The Innocence of Muslims' The White House maintains that there was no evidence the attack was preplanned by a terrorist group -- rather, they say, it appears to have been a spontaneous mob of Islamic extremists. 'We are looking at indications that individuals involved in the attack may have had connections to Al Qaeda or Al Qaeda's affiliates, in particular Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,' Mr Olsen told the Senate. However, he added, 'the facts that we have now indicate that this was an opportunistic attack on our embassy, the attack began and evolved and escalated over several hours.'

"A U.S. company has partnered with Queensland researchers in the hope of producing human kidneys on 3D printers. Last year the research team at the University of Queensland, led by Professor Melissa Little, were able to grow a tiny kidney, just two millimetres long, in a laboratory dish. The San Diego based bio-printing company, Organovo have signed an agreement with the University of Queensland's company UniQuest to see how far they might be able to push the research, in the hope that eventually they will be able to bio-print kidneys. Researchers in Queensland have been able to grow a two millimetre long kidney in lab conditions (Left: file photo). It is hoped this research might lead to 3D printing of kidneys (a 3D printer is pictured right) Bio-printing, the 3D printing of body parts, has been occurring for years. There has been success in printing skin, blood vessel, the cartilage of the ear, and some success with more complex parts such as the bladder and uterus. Bio-printing kidneys could increase the number of organs available for people needing transplants and greatly improve the chances of transplant success. Professor Melissa Little leads the research team at the University of Queensland who have signed an agreement with bio-printing company Organovo . However, the dream of bio-printing a kidney is still 15 to 20 years away, estimates Professor Little because the kidney is such a complex organ. 'Bio-engineering a kidney is probably the most difficult thing you could try and build,' she said. 'The kidney is a large organ with 35 different cell types that all have different functions, and a whole lot of little tubules that have to be lined up the right way, making it a much more complex organ than the liver, the pancreas or the heart.' Organova's ultimate goal might be to print a kidney, but their initial goal is to reproduce tiny kidneys in laboratory settings, as Professor Little's team have already done, which can be used for drugs testing. They might help test cures for renal diseases caused by genetic conditions and also speed up the process of producing pharmaceuticals. 'Most drugs that are developed fail, because they are harmful either to the heart or to the kidney. So if you could find out very early that the drugs you're producing would hurt the kidney you wouldn't waste your time developing it,' said Professor Little. It is hoped that eventually 3D printers, such as this one producing a likeness of Bruce Willis, might be able to make organs .","Researchers from the University of Queensland grew a tiny kidney in a dish .

"Selfie was named ‘word of the 2013’ by Oxford Dictionaries but now there's a new term on the block: the usie. Pronounced 'uss-ee' - and rhyming with 'fussy' - the word marks the growing trend for people squeezing their friends into their camera frame, as well as themselves. Examples include the famous Oscars usie taken by Bradley Cooper and featuring Kevin Spacey, Angelina Jolie, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence and Ellen Degeneres, among others. Say cheese! There's a new word to describe a group selfie and it's usee (pronounced uss-ee). This is perhaps the most famous example, taken by Bradley Cooper and featuring a host of Hollywood stars at the lastest Oscars ceremony . The ubiquitous selfie taken by Bradley Cooper on Ellen DeGeneres’ phone was all over the media following the Oscars . The problem that many people highlighted was the fact that Cooper's arms weren’t quite long enough to fit everyone in - but now there’s a solution, dubbed the 'selfie stick.' A number of companies are now selling 'arm extenders' that not only hold the camera, but are also used to take the shot and even focus the image. The trend for cameras on sticks, also known as monopods, isn’t new and a number of sticks are already available for digital cameras from companies including Opteka and XShot. Monpods work by holding the camera in landscape mode, with the screen facing the photographer, and using the front-facing camera. Buttons on the handle of the stick are used to control the device. Depending on the model, some monopods will manually press the shutter button on the side of phone using an arm, or similar. Others connect remotely via Bluetooth and take the photo using software controls. Some people think selfies are a mark of vanity and Michal Ann Strahilevitz, a professor of marketing at Golden Gate University in San Francisco who studies consumer behaviour, said: ‘Usies are a growing trend that I think have far more social value than selfies.’ In contrast to one-person selfies, usies are ‘more about the relationship, and less about you and your hair,’ he said. The word, which can be spelled usie, and ussie, has been showing up in written material since at least April 2013, according to Ben Zimmer, executive producer of Vocabulary.com and language columnist for The Wall Street Journal. A Business Insider story from January noted that the outstretched arm of the photo-taker in usies is a ‘signature’ of the image, because the shooter has to get the camera far enough away to get the group in the frame. In March, The Times of India said Pope Francis' group selfie with visitors at the Vatican last year ‘could possibly be the first chronicled celebrity usie.’ Other publications have proclaimed the selfie trend dead, with usies rising in popularity to replace them. ‘There are countless variations on the theme, including “twofie,” “threefie,” et cetera, if you want to specify the number of people photographed,’ said Zimmer. A recent study found that selfies taken of a couple, known as relfies, are a sign of a strong relationship, but can make people unpopular with their friends. Michal Ann Strahilevitz, a professor of marketing at Golden Gate University in San Francisco, said: 'Usies are a growing trend that I think have far more social value than selfies.' Here, Prime Minister David Cameron takes an usie with locals during campaigning for the local election in Harrow, northwest London . In March, The Times of India said Pope Francis' group selfie (pictured) with visitors at the Vatican last year 'could possibly be the first chronicled celebrity usie' Dr Benjamin Le, of the University of Haverford in Pennsylvania, found that people tended to think their friends were in happier relationships when they first started posting pictures together, or referred to each other in relationship statuses on social networks. 'The take home message is that others will assume you are in a good relationship if you post relfies, change your status to 'in a relationship with…', and talk about your relationship on Facebook,' he wrote. 'In addition, people viewing your profile are pretty accurate in their ratings of your relationship. If you are in a strong relationship, viewers can pick that up from your Facebook profile. 'However, there is some danger in getting too schmoopie about your relationship on Facebook; although your friends will think your relationship is going well, they will like you less.' The relfie, or 'relationship selfie' can quickly become annoying for friends, researchers have warned - but is a sign of a strong relationship.","The photo taken at the Oscars by Bradley Cooper is perhaps the most famous example of an usie .

Two men, aged 33 and 31, have been arrested on suspicion of murder, and were being questioned by detectives today. Emergency services were called to the road outside the pub at 12.45am on Sunday morning, and police said the argument had 'resulted in the victim being pushed into the path of a moving car'. Despite attempts by paramedics to treat Mr Wasdell, he died at the scene.

Tributes have been left to Mr Wasdell, who was known to many of his friends by the nickname 'Fudge', with a makeshift memorial set up next to the pub, which was closed yesterday with the road sealed off. Mr Wasdell was a Manchester United fan and a well-known figure at Power Mill, a nearby gym. Among the flowers left at the scene were pairs of boxing gloves. 'We are going to miss you,' is written on one. Under a picture of Mr Wasdell, he is described as a 'legend' and 'a small guy with a huge heart and personality'. A United flag has also been laid at the scene with more tributes written on it, as well as a team shirt. A note attached to a bunch of flowers read: 'One of the nicest decent happiest people I have ever come across. Scroll down for video . 'You will be so missed. Was a pleasure to know you mate. I've so many good memories from when we was younger. Truly missed, heaven as gained an angel.' Another message left read: 'We are going to miss you. The lads at Power Mill.' A wreath has also been laid at the spot, while bunches of flowers and cards with heartfelt messages also decorate the posts on a grass verge. Scene: Mr Wasdell  died after a disturbance outside the Carters Arms pub in Rhodes, Middleton, Greater Manchester in the early hours of yesterday morning . One read: 'My old mate Little Fudge. So gutted you’re going. Craig Wardle.' Another said: “RIP fudge. Gutted to hear the news.' Friends also took to Twitter to express their sorrow at Mr Wasdell's death. Adam Loco wrote: 'RIP Fudge mate. Top lad with a heart of gold.' Andy Dunn added: 'RIP Fudge. Didn’t know you that well but you always had a smile on your face and was always shadow boxing in the gym.' Warren Tansey paid tribute to his ‘big heart’ and Adam A Williams added on Twitter:'“Middleton is going to miss you.' A Home Office post-mortem examination has established that Mr Wasdell died from multiple injuries. Det Supt Andy Peach, leading the investigation, appealed for witnesses to the incident itself and the fight outside the pub. He said: 'A man has lost his life after what appears to have been an argument which has got out of control. Tributes: A makeshift memorial has been left to Mr Wasdell, who was known to many of his friends by the nickname 'Fudge', next to the pub . In memory: A bottle of beer and a set of boxing gloves, with a message on each, are among the items that have been left by friends of Mr Wasdell, who was engaged to be married . 'I understand the community will be concerned about what has happened but we believe this was an isolated incident. 'We have already made one arrest in connection with the incident and we have a number of lines of inquiry to follow up and we are confident further arrests will follow.
